People whoever miss out to buy will comment negetive about BTC. Its human nature. 
I heard exactly same comments from multiple people when price was $1.5k,2k.......18k..19k.
BTC is always a risky instrument but every day more and more people adopting it.

BTC is very volatile market ,always does this dip, then after 2 hrs back on 18.5K otherwise what is the fun for day traders

Expect 15 to 40 minutes.
If paid fair enough fees you will get first confirmation within first 2 blocks.

UPS or customs will contact you once the hardware arrives in you country, you can pay the VAT and collect or UPS will drop to you. Not to worry all goes well.

I mined and hodled XX BTC for 2 and half year. I sold all my coins  each when price fall on 16th July 2017. My plan was to buy back  so I put a buy order. ha that price never came and blink of an eye  it was too late for me to buy back at even2k . I was under tremendous stress. . I am a person was ready to hold until 500k a coin but made that mistake and I always think about it and feel sad for the decision I made. So, my best advice is hold and you make 10X. I am back in to mining now..smile

Kraken is full of Shi**e. I moved away from that site, lost a lot of money because of the glitch in kraken platform. So far Bitstamp is very good.

Above video give an idea.

This is exactly what I thought when I sold at $2k..BTC is not going to crash because its spread much wider last 10 months and its going keep on growing. Only possibility is  US government/SK government ban BTC then BTC can crash. Pump and dump always happen but end of the day BTC pick up better price.

Here you go. Now they come up with hacking..missing here and there..

You guys don't understand.
The chief executive of Bitfinex and Tether is the same guy Jan Ludovicus van der Velde.
The fact in that they are wash trading with the funds, 500M liquidity (or a few billion leveraged liquidity), they can pretty much decide the BTC price all on their own.
$317 million was available for margin trading on Bitfinex the other day. Leverage it at even 3x and you have $1 BILLION to push the market with.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:32:35
Next drop is expected on the day bitfinex shutdown by the authorities.
Tether is owned by bitfinex?? not sure howmuch truth is this story, but documentation shows CEO and CFO of Tether are Bitfinex owners.

This can be exchange itself. Manipulating the sell wall, after an hour they remove that sell wall.
Why I said this because doing trading I lost a lot of my BTC chasing those wall in the past.

I faced many issues with Kraken even today. Not good for day trading. After multiple attempts  a buy or sell order go through. Lost many opportunity to buy BTC/XRP/ETH. But what can we do. So far happy with bitstamp.
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:45:41
Was a fake wall.

This is what he tweeted.
But no official announcement. 
His second reply to his tweet is 'Some people want to know what I know. So less insider trading.' 
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:57:40
Valid point.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:34:28
I am fully aware of how market works. Tell me any other trading commodity have $800 in difference. Totally understand the exchange situation in China.

YES, BTC will drop for next few weeks..but not as much as shows in the picture.
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:08:08
I can see 25th August(last month) same behavior, a huge spike then around 20.30GMT a big dump.
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:59:20
I think two reasons BTC price can drop next few weeks.
1. From mid July to end of August BTC price climbed too fast - Somehow price need to stabilize.
2. BTC exchange closer in china made above fall happen sooner

Dont give that crap..'people buy'..this must be a whale...or a shitty news..or exchange manipulated pricing..as soon a small buyer like me goes in and buy..bang..a big dump..Anyway go on BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:30:21
Well said..guy knows what he is actually talking about.
Thanks for sharing.

The whole market is manipulated. Media 'Caixin' waited for BTC to fall below 3000$ to release the news. So, they can buy a big lot of BTC and dump them after the news.

Very meaningful image..I was looking through actual data on bitstamp..thanks

I am aware of all the BTC news.

To transfer USD, use 'International Bank' and fill in the details.
Before sending big amount,try to send $5 or $10 to your bank account for test.
Bitstamp is very reliable exchange, once I did a wrong wire transfer and money came back to my account after 4 days.

I really wish BTC price go up but price will come down soon. Next two months very critical for BTC.
Why price will come down soon? - If you guys look at last one week exchange data on  accumalated daily exhange transactions was around 150k daily, this is less than 1% of total BTC available in the market. Current holding price of 4.2k is manupalated by exchanges and big whales and bots.This is what I am thinking.
I advice to invest small amount of money in small dips, then wait next dip (patience is the virtue)  as you can see price dipped from 4.4k from yesterday to 4.17 this afternoon. You dont have  to follow what I said at the end its your money.

My whole point is BTC price should be nearly matched all around the world ($50/$100) is acceptable but $800? who is manipulating all above prices.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:43:11
I was not talking about trading on Chinese exchange..Never used a Chinese exchange.. I am based in Europe..I was talking about the price difference.
