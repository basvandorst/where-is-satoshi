Real Satoshi Nakamoto said, ' extraordinary claim does not need extraordinary proof but it required genuine proof. Satoshi Nakamoto has published on his twitter on the 4 may that he did not generated the Genesis Block  and and Block  Bitcoin addresses with Hashing of the Private Keys but he created those earlier Bitcoin Addresses with another secret system. Therefore those earlier Bitcoin Addrsses do not have conventional cryptographic private key to sign messages or transfer Bitcoin from one addresses to another with Private Keys but he has some other way to transfer Bitcoin. He also stated that he does not need to sign messages or move Bitcoin to that he is Satoshi Nakamoto but he will very his identity with another means and this will end the confusion and conspiracy theories and speculation about Bitcoin invention and about him.'
Satoshi said he met Jon Matonis in 10 July 2014 and Jon Matonis did not believe him that he is really Satoshi Nakamoto. The real truth is Gavin and Jon Matonis do not want to reveal the mysterious and horendoust story of Bitcoin invention. They are cautious it might harm their reputation. Satoshi Nakamoto told me that Jon Matonis and Gavin both have done a great job for him to market Bitcoin. He has forgiven all the Cypherpunks and hackers and DPRs who together hijacked the Bitcoin Project from His Honesty Satoshi Nakamoto the inventor of Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology.

Bitcoin Invention has a another story. A story that is very different. Bitcoin and Satoshi is a world class epic drama. I have spent 2 years to find the real Satoshi Nakamoto who is victim. Bitcoin Project was hijacked from His Honesty Satoshi Nakamoto. The Bitcoin community leaders should rethink what they have done to hijack the Bitcoin Project from a visionary scientist. They must confess their wrong doing. HH Satoshi Nakamoto is humble man of principle. He has suffered very gravely and still continuously suffering while greedy hackers and Cypherpunks have become millionaires out of his Bitcoin Project. I am Roselyn Hamilton requesting to Gavin Andresen and all other Bitcoin community leaders to think humanely what they are doing? There is a limit for wrong doing. You should have not done this thing to a scientist. HH Satoshi Nakamoto  will forgive you all if you seek his pardone.

BBC should now organise a grand Bitcoin and Blockchain Summit and invite  all the ex candidates and the current Satoshi candidate Dr. Craig Wright. All the Bitcoin and Blockchain community leaders will be there in the Summit. The BBC must hire independent forensic exparts to very the every elements to identify the real Satoshi Nakamoto. I will request His Divine Holiness Satoshi Nakamoto to attend the Summit to end all the conspiracy theories and speculation regarding Bitcoin invention and about Him. He will definitely attend the Summit and unmask himself and reward accreditations to all the hackers and Bitcoin and Blockchain developers those have assisted His Divine Holiness Satoshi Nakamoto by engaging themselves this revolutionary Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
