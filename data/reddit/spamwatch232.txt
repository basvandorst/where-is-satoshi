That would be great to have stocks, but I would recommend putting it on a completely separate page.  
Really appreciate your work on this!

SCAM ALERT!  There are a lot of major signs that this could be a scam.    First what could possibly be wrong - he placed orders for mining machines.  Well look at a past scams and you realize ordering machines doesn't mean anything, they could still easily run:
[BAKEWELL Scam!](
[BAKEWELL Scam!](
On to the website, very fake looking:
-  The mining machine pictured on the [home page]( is a total rip-off [from this site](
- Mining machine shows a picture of a DVD drive - why would you need a DVD player for a mining machine?
- The 3rd image in the slider is also a very obvious rip-off - It shows the old ps2 mouse and  keyboard plugs. 
They could have at least choose to copy images of a current generation machine - I think USB seems to be the way of the future :)
- The [shopping page at](  - They didn't even bother to update with their proper contact information - It shows "My Company  42 avenue des Champs Elysées"
It seems Kenneth E. Slaughter is fictional - His [linked in profile](
 looks to be recently created - he has 0 connections.  If your are the CEO of any reputable company you will have at least 200+ connections.  And there are some posts where he mentions he is from Missouri, so that does seem to link him to the profile.
And Google turns up nothing, if he really ran a company previously (he claims to have run an ISP for a number of years) you would find something in Google archives.
If he wants to validate he is real and honest pay a trusted community member to validate his identity like was done for this group buy - [for a good example look at this first post here](

I agree, I just hope people are doing their homework before investing.  It is painful to see so many people getting scammed in the bitcoin world.
I would like to see his identity verified by a trusted site admin and then I would invest more.
Good luck with your investment!

Yes, I created a throw-away account just to post this.  No this is not rikur, I was just investigating AMC because I was interested in investing.
I am not going to  debating whether or not this is a scam, just wanted to post a warning.
I will post this on bitcointalk as well.
