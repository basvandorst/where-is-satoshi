What do you think Snowden would do once he bought this passport? Just jump on a commercial flight to South America? He definitely wouldn't be going to St Kitts and Nevis because they have an extradition treaty with the US. 
It's not happening. He's stuck there for the time being.

The US government probably does at least that much in sales every day as well, in its partnership with the cartels. And they allow others to launder drug money. HSBC, Wells Fargo anyone? They get a slap on the wrist and this guy goes to jail. While I don't agree with what they're doing, I think we should have a consistent standard of what is or isn't legal. Either selling drugs and laundering money from those sales is illegal, or it is legal. Pick one.

It's weird because although it's a currency people are treating it as a commodity which actually makes it one! The only question is when/where will things settle down ? Once that happens it will effectively turn into a currency again. It's all so interesting!


Me too. If it helps, I think we're part of a very large cohort, especially today!
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:49:32

I know OP can't walk away right now, my comment was directed at others who might have gotten a warning from them about bitcoin, or just those in general that still do business with banks. At least move your money over to a credit union. They are much less likely, from my experience and everything I've heard, to do this sort of thing.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:56:15
Yeah, it's funny sort of problem because btc is a currency, ultimately, but people are treating it as though it's a commodity atm... and I guess that means it's both. We'll see how it all pans out! I don't know whether I'm fortunate or not in not being able to "invest" (for lack of a better term) more heavily in btc right now but it's a really cool experiment and highly entertaining for sure. Also teaching me and many others about markets and investing in general so all around A+. 10/10 would btc again.

So why would you choose to do business with an organization that, by your definition, perpetrates fraud on an almost daily basis? It's well known that people routinely experience delays beyond the original eta of your coins, and that those issues eventually get resolved but it takes time. 
So, knowing that, you choose to go ahead and dump in tens of thousands of dollars into coinbase when time is a crucial factor in whatever you're trying to accomplish? Bad idea, man.

...but there are restrictions on new accounts. 10 BTC per day, and you can't buy more until your first purchase is completed.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:14:38
Cool... credit unions are the way to go. In case you haven't gotten notice already, before you close your account, if it were me personally I'd wait until they contact you to let you know that they won't allow any BTC related transactions. Once they do, ask for documentation in writing. This is important because when you go to make a stink about it you want to have proof, not just a phone convo. Once you have that documentation, raise hell :) Best of luck to you and keep us updated, please! I really think this is the next major hurdle BTC and alternative currencies in general are facing right now. Just my uneducated opinion, of course.
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:35:26
Not sure, I haven't done the level 2 verification
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:00:47
That's how coinbase works though, and everyone knows it. Also, I was just thinking back to those really volatile days (was Dec 8 one of them? Can't remember but it might have been) when coinbase actually had a notice that prices wouldn't be locked in at the time of sale like they normally were. 
Anyway, it's just my personal opinion of course, but I believe that people need to take responsibility for their actions. Coinbase has a history of delays, so why the hell would you want to use them if you're a short-term speculator? I'm not convinced at this point that coinbase did anything wrong. That could always change, of course.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:54:18
Got it. I was replying to Veneerds using the example they used. I probably should have said "it's not illegal, either" for clarity.

Well, yeah, those are the options we have right now. Nobody is obligated to provide anyone with a bitcoin exchange. This isn't like medicare or something. It's bitcoin. So you have to choose which option you are best able to tolerate, or crate your own option. Don't like the way coinbase does business? Don't do business with them. Don't like the way the other exchanges do business? Don't do business with them. Don't like any of your available options? Create your own exchange. Those are your choices.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:00:52

I sure hope so... I hope the busts aren't used against the movement. There's a paternalistic side to this government that I'm sure is just itching to "protect" people from bitcoin. That's what I worry about.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:09:48
I really don't know enough about it to even speculate at this point but I think what you're saying is totally plausible, from what little I do know. I do think a lot of the future price of btc will depend on the rate of new merchants accepting it and the size of those that do. So, in my mind it's equally possible that there won't be a crash anytime soon as long as we keep seeing more businesses saying they will accept it. Who knows what will happen, though... I'm just pulling all this straight out of my ass.
I think the best advice I keep seeing on here is don't invest more than you are prepared to lose.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:57:39
TL;DR: bitcoin will fail because it's right-wing, because money only works when it is a creation of the government, because people like it too much which caused the price to rise this year, because we cannot control it.
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:01:03
Get angry, get loud. Let everyone know that your bank thinks they can tell you how to spend your money. Go to the news, go to your friends, go to anyone who will listen. 
I'm really sorry this happened to you, but since it did you have got to protest it or else banks will get the idea that they can actually do this and ALL of them will start doing it.

I absolutely would take it to the news *if* I banked with Chase and got notification that I didn't have their permission to spend my own money as I pleased. I don't and haven't, so I can't. As I said in my original comment. I'm really sorry this is happening to people, but now the onus is on them to do something good for the whole btc community. It's not fair, they didn't choose this, but here we are. Whatever way I can help, I will, because I believe in bitcoin.

You can see that especially in the iPad cases. Really lovely design and if I wasn't broke I'd totally buy one for myself. I just looked over the website and I have one little suggestion - I hope you don't mind :) If it were my store, I would change the way the items are listed because it's sort of awkward. Say you go to look at the iPad cases... right now there are pages and pages of different listings, but the only thing that changes is the fabric option. If I were you/her, I'd create like a "master listing" for that design, and then have a drop down menu of the fabric choices. It would be a lot easier to navigate the site that way and that's how a lot of other clothing/accessory sites do it. Just makes everything simpler/sleeker which would go along with the aesthetic she's presenting. Anyway, hope you don't mind the unsolicited advice. Good luck to your wife on her business, but she's got some fab design skills so she doesn't really need it ;)

@_date: 2013-12-01 17:47:24
I'm not attacking you, let me make that clear. I know it's a big problem, especially in bigger cities, and it's fucking annoying to be panhandled. Some people can get really aggressive and you just want to tell them to fuck off (and even I do sometimes if someone is being a dick. I'm not Saint Formerly Homeless okayfineyeah lol). Some clearly do use the money for cigarettes or booze or whatever. But I don't know, when I was homeless I met a lot of people that used the cash they panhandled for a hot meal somewhere, or occasionally a motel room if the night was going to be extremely cold. Bus tickets, a load of laundry, stuff like that. Good on you for helping people at all because a lot of people don't. 
As I said, I'm not attacking you or your approach, I just want to point out that a lot of people panhandling are not addicts and don't spend the money that way. If you want your money being spent on something you approve of, like food, toiletries, transportation, shelter or whatever need you are okay with helping, the best thing to do is what you're doing - go with the person and purchase whatever it is they need. Your leftovers from a restaurant are a great thing to give as well. I should add that you're doing an additional service to someone when you take them to the store for food - you're talking to them which always helped me feel like a human being again. 
I can't explain how isolating and shaming it is to stand on a street corner and beg for money. You're dirty, you feel like shit because you're homeless and a loser out begging for money, you know you smell like shit too, you're hating yourself because you never thought your life would get to this point... and then most people look at you with a grimace like you're a piece of poop they stepped in before walking off without even saying anything, not even "No." It is the worst. So, good on you, keep it up in whatever way makes you feel the most comfortable.

However, coinbase has known issues with delays so I'd say avoid them at all costs if your aim is to make some money speculating on btc. Beyond that, I don't have an answer for you. You could go check out and they would likely have some helpful advice for you. Best of luck!

Congratulations, man. This is awesome. Keep up the good work. I was homeless a couple of times in my life and know how hard it is and how much what you're doing matters. I wish I had something to donate but until I do you have my prayers. Good on you for doing this.

If I got word from my bank that I wasn't "allowed" to spend my own money on bitcoin or bitcoin related products like mining hardware, you bet your ass I would contact the local news about it. But I use a credit union so I don't see that happening anytime soon... if it does, I'll make a huge stink about it because it's not right. Nobody should be able to tell you that you can't spend your very own money on a lawful product or service. This is like visa and paypal telling everyone that we couldn't donate to wikileaks. Total bullshit.

If they find that they have enough customers who don't like that policy, they might decide to stop being a victim. Or, they could choose to continue being a doormat to the big banks and go out of business. Either way it's up to the customers to make it happen. I don't do business with OKPay but if I did I would leave them immediately, make sure they knew why I was leaving, and let them know I'd be telling everyone I could not to use them and why.

Move to a credit union and you can still buy bitcoins. No more inconvenient than a regular bank account and there's the added bonus of you being able to do whatever the fuck you want with your own gd money.
As I said, I'm sorry you guys have to deal with this shit. But since you do, you have an opportunity to make a difference for the rest of us.

Coinbase is not the thing you want to use for day trading. If you'd done your research you'd know that this is how they work. There's a shitload of threads in about this exact fucking issue. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:55:17
Seriously, ALWAYS. Coinbase is not what you want to use if you want to do day trading, simple as that.

Lol, well when you put it that way...
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:11:46
I feel ya... but I still think bitcoin has a long way to go, so I put in a little money here and there when I can. Most likely it will be worth more someday, maybe not, but I don't want to feel the same sense of "GD it" a couple of years from now if it actually does end up going to the mars. I don't think it's too late.
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:54:11
Please tell me where I said ANYTHING about localbitcoins. I didn't. Nobody is forcing youto buy from coinbase. You can buy from other places using a wire transfer, and many do. Or if you really hate your available options that much, go start your own exchange. Nobody's stopping you.

Bullshit. Sorry, I was a panhandler at once point in time and that money always went to the grocery store for food. People assume that all homeless are addicts and it's just not true.

Bitcoin isn't online poker. It's not illegal. Why shouldn't you be able to spend your money on it? Why the fuck does the BANK get to decide what you spend your money on? The whole point of bitcoin is to get away from the machine so stand the fuck up and speak out.

Not whining, simply saying I think it's a bad idea to promote this as a get rich quick scheme and create a bunch of new "daytraders." And yeah, fair enough criticism... should have worded it a different way. Thank you for your input, butter... stick? Lol have a good one.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:27:31
Maybe daytrading isn't the right term to be using. He's *speculating* on bitcoin and using a site (coinbase) with known, documented delays in delivering the btc to do so. Not a very bright idea, IMO.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:49:52
No shit, man... people should probably read up on the service they are using BEFORE they drop this kind of money. This is par for the course with Coinbase, which OP would know if they did any research before they bought. Coinbase will get it sorted, they always do.

Ask to speak to their boss, and that person's boss, all the way up the line as many times as you need to until you get someone who actually makes decisions.

@_date: 2013-11-28 18:18:51
It's not, though. I bought last week and they took the money out of my account almost immediately and it still took a week to get my BTC. Did another small buy a couple of days ago, same thing - money is taken from my account, and I'm still waiting on my coin. I'm not really impressed with coinbase, honestly. I think the only advantage it has over the other sites is the ability to link you bank account and not have to fuck around with a wire transfer. The delays are really annoying.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:16:20

You shouldn't be downvoted for this. You're absolutely right. I mean, we're not headed down a particularly rosy path right now but we haven't yet reached Stalin/Mao/Hitler/etc proportions, obviously. 
But personally I don't fault people for being apprehensive, even if they don't know how to say what they are feeling. We *should* be worried - all the signs are saying that things are not headed in a good direction right now. The problem is that people have no knowledge of history so their legit concerns end up sounding ridiculous.

I think it's probably because they don't know about it, or else there isn't one in the area. That's just a guess though. Stuff like that didn't really exist when I was homeless 10-15 years ago, and if it did I didn't know about it. I gladly would have gone somewhere like that. Still probably would, actually :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:08:00

That doesn't mean he should kill himself.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:08:27
That just underscores my point. Why would you send tens of thousands of dollars to coinbase without researching how coinbase works (or doesn't)? It doesn't make sense to me.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:23:01
I suppose should have used a more specific term, so let me revise my statement - I don't think it's a good idea to use coinbase if you're a btc speculator because of the time delays, which are very well documented. This shouldn't have come as a surprise to him because this is how coinbase operates.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:51:02

Bullying? Again, nobody is forcing anyone to use coinbase. If you read about it and see something you don't like, don't use it. It's simple.
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:14:23
There was a thread posted in a couple of days ago by some kid who lost 7k of his dad's money in bitcoin and was going to kill himself. Is it reasonable to kill yourself over 7k, or any amount of money for that matter? Of course not. Are people thinking about it anyway? Yes. Have some fucking compassion.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:38:39
You can do whatever the fuck you want to. Make a new coin called shitcoin and then set up a really sweet exchange that has all the features and functionality you want so you can daytrade the fuck out of it and make a million billion shitcoins from it. I don't give a fuck, just stop fucking whining. Damn whiners. Get off my lawn. ;)
Edit, you're not whining, I get that. I was referring to OP.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:48:15
I don't think it is, but I don't know enough about it to say for sure. I think most people have better experiences with mt gox and the other big one - can't remember the name right now. Coinbase can sort of do whatever it wants because they know they have their US customers by the short hairs, so to speak. That's just my opinion, of course, but look at the way they operate. I don't understand the need for such a delay when no other site works like that. It's unfortunate because I think a lot of people who are new to BTC, myself included, go to coinbase because it seems to have a more user-friendly interface and because you can buy BTC without having to do a wire transfer. I mean, I don't know how I would even begin to do one, you know? So for now, while they remain the only site for US customers that allows you to link to your bank acct, they're making money and making people wait for their coins. If there's an alternative to it, I'd like to know about it because I'm already sick of the way they do things and I haven't even been with them for 2 weeks. Am I sick of them enough to figure out what/how a wire transfer works and move to mt gox? I don't know.
@_date: 2013-12-17 07:34:59

@_date: 2013-11-27 19:30:30


but a huge effect on general public BTC awareness...
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:56:47
Lots of people just use wire transfers. Point is, he's trying to daytrade - if not ON coinbase, WITH coinbase. Just a bad idea all around given coinbase's history of delays. 
Also, he just updated that he got his coins after this public tantrum, but wait, he's not done yet! "Looks like my battle with them isn't coming to a close anytime soon. They should have delivered the coins on Friday like they said they would." 
So, he got what he wanted, but it turns out that's not what he wanted at all! So what does he want? I don't know. I personally think he just wants to fight and complain because he lost money after not doing due diligence. Or it could be something else entirely that none of us are privy to atm.
On a side note, something that may or may not be relevant to this situation, IIRC on the really volatile days recently, coinbase had a pop up message saying that they weren't going to lock the price in at the time of sale like they normally do. Was Dec 8 one of those days? Don't remember and don't care to look it up, but it's possible.
As always, just my "humble" opinion, of course.
@_date: 2013-12-17 07:39:10
I don't think it's bad that they are talking about it.... it's just this get rich quick shit that bothers me.

I am so sorry this is happening to people... but you guys have simply got to throw a huge fucking fit. Let everyone know, including local media, all your friends, anyone who will listen, that Chase bank (and the other banks that are trying to pull this shit) thinks it can tell you how to spend YOUR money. This is complete and utter bullshit. The way you guys respond to this is going to have HUGE impact on the future of bitcoin in this country and around the world.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:08:01
But if the money has already been taken out of my account, what do they need to wait a whole week for? Yeah, you can get verified for instant buys if you have a credit card, but what difference does it make if they already have my payment? It's not like they have to ship in the bitcoins or something.

I'll admit I don't have a lot of knowledge about the laws when it comes to BTC. I mean, there aren't even a lot of laws dealing with this right now, right? But yeah, the nugget of all this is that banks have no right to tell you what you can spend your money on. I really don't understand why people still do business with banks, TBH. Move your money to a credit union. Your voice has a much better chance of being heard. The banks already know they're too big to fail so they don't have to listen to their customers.

@_date: 2013-12-17 03:05:56
That's cool it's being mentioned on msn and all, but I don't know if this is the kind of publicity bitcoin needs or wants.
First, dismissing criticism of the volatility of the BTC market right now, (which is arguably a legit issue IMO) as "blah blah blah." Real professional...
Then they go on to say "I know what you are thinking. The dot-com boom ended in disaster. Indeed, it did. The dot-com boom was indeed a bubble.  But before that bubble popped there were many that profited handsomely and did so over a long period of time before the implosion. *Exactly the same thing is going to happen with Bitcoin.* [emphasis added] Yes, the story will end, perhaps even badly, but before that occurs you have what I consider to be one of the best investment opportunities of 2014." I mean... seriously?
Their argument for buying into bitcoin is simply that "demand is insatiable," and "supply is limited." With these sorts of endorsements I think we can expect the boom/bust cycle to continue for the foreseeable future. People are still looking at this largely as a way to get rich quick, and it ain't gonna happen for most people. That isn't what it's supposed to be about.
"Analysis" like this will only serve to bring in more amateur speculators ("it is something that if you get in now can make you rich") many of whom will no doubt dump a shitload of money into BTC without really understanding it or having any intention of using it as an alternative currency, and many will lose their shorts during the wild ride that's sure to come... I wouldn't be surprised if the media will then jump on these sob stories in the making to try to discredit BTC. I don't know man, publicity like this is the proverbial wolf in sheep's clothing, it seems to me. But what do I know...
Edit, if you downvote me, would you mind explaining why you disagree with me? I don't care about the votes but I'd like to know your opinion on things. Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:06:29
Absolutely. I have no doubt if the son came to his dad and let him know what was going on, how he was feeling, the gambling, the thoughts of suicide, all of it, the dad would tell him he loves him, give him a big hug, and get him some help. There's absolutely no reason to end a life over 7k. None.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:01:47
Not *instantly*, but like any other debit card transaction. It showed up in my bank account as pending when I checked it a few hours later and the transaction went through as any other would that evening. Still waited a week for my bitcoin to show up in my coinbase account. I don't understand the need for such delays.
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:34:15
No worries :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:03:09
Sure, I understand. I remember checking prices on coinbase during that time and it took them a while before the pop up started showing up. Not saying that's what happened for certain because I'm not OP and don't know what happened during that transaction, but I do think it's possible. Who knows.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:06:29
I made my first purchase and the same thing happened for my second.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:49:52
Yeah, no doubt coinbase has issues. I won't argue with that. But I don't think it's particularly responsible to dump in a shitload of money to a company that has known issues with delays and then complain when you can't day trade because of it. I don't have anything against daytrading or making as much money as you can from btc but don't make a dumb mistake and then try to blame it on someone else. That's what I think is going on here. I could be wrong, of course.
