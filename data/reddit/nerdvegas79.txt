It happened because of complex financial products that turned out to be full of crap. Real estate was the vehicle, but CDOs were the gas.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:27:23
Yes, but to say that it happened because of real estate isn't really true. It happened because of the use of complex and highly leveraged financial products. Real estate was the catalyst.

You aren't listening to what I'm saying, you're just having an argument.
I'm not telling you that the young don't understand that living in the moment is rewarding. I'm telling you that something starts to dawn on you at a deeper level as you get older, some realization of mortality that wasn't there before. You start to get this stronger appreciation for what you've experienced in life so far. Like I said, it's hard to explain.

Bitcoin inflation is determined algorithmically and is impossible to change. It halves every 4 years, and 80% of all coins that will ever exist have already been created. For all intent and purpose, Bitcoin is not inflationary. No other currency or store of value can match this. Even gold has 1-2% inflation per year.
Once Bitcoin stabilises it simply won't make sense to hold gold; and when it's a usable currency, it won't make sense to hold fiat either.

Er, anywhere third world? I don't think Lambos deal with potholes too well
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:32:46
As far as store of value goes (functionally), Bitcoin is superior to gold - it's less inflationary, and it's totally liquid, you can move it anywhere. In the long run I believe it will be valued higher than any other store of value for this reason... And when L2 tech matures, it will also become the strongest currency. Once its value stabilises, you're gonna have a hard time convincing people that they should hold fiat instead. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:04:11
Why does it need to be all of a sudden?
When bitcoins value becomes more stable, and it's easier to use, and L2 tech is established, and it starts getting accepted by more and more businesses, the effect will snowball. Why would people want to hold fiat in this scenario? The better currency will win out, and the previous currency will lose value until it's worthless. This has happened many times throughout history.

Meanwhile here in Australia a banking royal commission had uncovered systemic fraud on a grand scale. And internationally HSBC acts as the go-to institution for money laundering billions of dollars, many of which have been earned by drug cartels, corrupt governments and terrorist bodies. You can't take a holistic view of banking in a general historic sense and say that the current banking system is great. What matters is how finance operates today, and while I do get the point that you're making, it's probably more relevant to point out that things as they work today really need to change quite substantially.

Or save yourself the money and use electrum. You can create a watching-only wallet and never have to expose your private key online. It isn't convenient for spending, but if you're investing then that hardly matters - you can pay into the watching wallet.

Except for capital gains tax unfortunately
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:31:00
Here's the thing though. Currently in Australia our economy is flagging a bit, because we have high levels of household debt, which means people are spending less on stuff. If people spent less on stuff (non-essentials) by even, say 10%, that definitely has the capacity to screw the economy pretty bad. So this lower level of spending due to the deflationary nature of the now-default BTC currency could actually cause significant economic problems.
I say this as a holder and big believer in BTC. But we can't close our eyes to potential negative outcomes.
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:25:39
Use electrum. You just create a watching only wallet, and you sign transactions offline. Your seed/private key never go online. It's an HD wallet so addresses keep changing, fine to transact from.

I don't disagree with anything you're saying. It's just that 'robust' has a certain meaning in software and by that common definition, Bitcoin is robust. Something can have usability problems and still be robust. Bitcoin is a protocol and a network, and it is robust in the sense that it does what it says it does.
@_date: 2019-01-06 21:30:55
Just because you can send to the wrong address doesn't make it non robust. Robustness means that a thing consistently does what it is supposed to do, and does not fail. In this sense, Bitcoin is actually very robust.
@_date: 2019-01-22 19:13:35
Saving is not a threat to the economy - rampant capitalism driven by fractional reserve banking is, as will be witnessed by the next crash. Sound money - which Bitcoin is - is the antithesis of this. Sound money does not stop people from investing, running businesses and buying food or other products. Hodling is just the first early phase.

I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying that there is definitely a chance either way. The original post claimed that fiat will never collapse, and that kind of absolutist talk is ridiculous.
I personally do think that fiat will collapse at some point, but I don't claim to know that that will definitely happen.
@_date: 2019-01-22 19:08:15
Fiat will collapse if and when Bitcoin is as easy to use and is accepted in as many places as Fiat is, and stabilises in value. At that point, Bitcoin is the "better" currency - it doesn't inflate. At that point, why would anyone want to hold dollars? In this scenario fiat would lose value and would end up crowded out by Bitcoin.
What people don't seem to get is that this will be driven by personal choice. The better currency wins, it's happened plenty of times during the course of history.
I'm not saying any of the above is definitely going to happen, but to claim that it definitely is NOT going to happen is just as silly.

Electrum yes. Good instructions, you can generate your private key offline. All you need to do is keep your seed safe. You do not need to pay for a hardware wallet.

I really wish one heuristic key bip would be chosen or become the defacto standard.

People really don't want to have to worry about this stuff and potentially losing their cold stored coins.
