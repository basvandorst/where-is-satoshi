That is very sweet of you...thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:21:43
No! absolutely not…but I'm just curious.
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:46:13
Oh but such a price drop never happened.
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:52:54
Wait...did you give me 0.25 cents worth of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:24:37
What is that?
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:44:01
The economy is new…but this price drop is too wild.

You seem to be mistaken...the discussion that you linked me to had another link to a research paper. The research paper said that the transactions which use tor can be deanonymized by abusing the anti-Dos element of the Bitcoin network. Here is the research paper: 
I think that this is a great concern and it is something that needs to be addressed. What do you guys think?

I understand that it dropped more but it is constantly dropping since December.

Too much text...and too many complicated terms. Can someone summarize this for me?

This Bitcoin wallet is pretty cool.

Could it be that we are now paying for the exponential price increase that happened in late 2013?

Bitcoin recovered from the crash, and is growing.
Nothing can stop Bitcoin.

Satoshi mined the first Bitcoins, and he was involved with MT.GOX.
Clearly he sold them and made a lot of money.
A LOT of money.
You know what, Bitcoin's founder is really smart. He found a way to make millions from thin air. The way he made his millions is just epic.
He created a new currency LOL!
And he can't be accused of scamming, or doing anything illegal.
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:00:57
You must be new here.
@_date: 2015-01-20 02:08:01
Yes it is.
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:22:51
But the problem is, MT.GOX might have converted those Bitcoins, to cash by selling the Bitcoins to other Bitcoin traders.

Bitcoin is the savior of poor economies.
