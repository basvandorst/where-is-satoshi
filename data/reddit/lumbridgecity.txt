It just happened again.  This issue is only dealing with a few satoshi, but it keeps occurring. I had 0.00224815 BTC, I sent 0.00220002 BTC, and the confirmation screen said I sent that much, but when I reload my account, it now says I sent  0.00224815 BTC AND now the account is 113 satoshi overdrawn.
The mess is, I will only receive the 0.00220002 BTC I sent and 4810 satoshi remains unaccounted for, plus the 113 satoshi fee I now owe... it's only a couple pennies - but imagine a couple pennies out of every CoinBase transaction...  
Genius of them. No?

Paypal already lets you transfer your funds between many different fiat currencies... I'm anticipating the option to send paypal funds to a bitcoin address.

These kind of shifts in business will cause mass waves of people getting in to bitcoin...  and it's just the start.  
Kind of gives you butterflies in your tummy when you think about it eh?
