And a supermarket owner buys bread from the baker, food from the farmer, and sells it to the customer with a small markup.  What is the supermarket owner actually doing, holding inventory, taking risk, and making it easy for the customer to get goods on demand when they want it.
Replace "supermarket owner" with trader.

A bunch of new miners came online.  Block time has been &lt; 8 minutes.  With the difficulty adjustment, we'll see if it lasts

50k at a time is 36 withdrawals to keep track of.  Much easier to just do one.  Firms this large should be able to handle a ~100 btc transaction.

BoA was caught reordering pending transactions so that you overdraft when you're near zero.
It'll put all of your withdrawals before your deposits.  With almost no deposits being immediate except for cash, this caused a lot of problems.

That assumes the network hashrate continues to rise.  If as mining becomes less profitable (difficulty increases, bitcoin prices going down, energy costs going up), people will turn off their miners.  It'll take longer than 10 minutes/block and difficulty will go down.

The prosecutors didn't go forward with the case.  It was tainted by the fact that a couple of the agents were caught stealing bitcoins.  Also, Ross was already in jail for 2 life sentences so it didn't make sense to waste time and money on the case.

* He was in a public place logged in as admin
* He kept extensive chat logs on EVERYTHING on the laptop
* He kept id scans of other admins on the laptop
* He kept all of his private keys (for pgp and bitcoin) on the laptop
* Nothing was compartmentalized (ie Access to the laptop meant access to everything. Good opsec would have separate encrypted folders for various things)

Because you can't sign transactions from that setup.  One of the big selling points of the hardware wallet is that you can plug it in, sign a transaction, and unplug it without your private keys leaving your device.
Before hardware wallets, people had esoteric setups with QR codes used to ferry transactions from an airgapped computer.  The alternative is having the wallet on a non-airgapped computer which has its own risks.
