Hope it still helps, take what you will:
Bitcoin is a very wide effort done by volunteers all over the world to address as many of the current pitfalls of money usage as possible. The current state of Bitcoin has fixed, or mostly fixed, among other issues:
 * Supply: Bitcoin units are generated at a predetermined rate, and the total supply is public and known at all times.
 * Public Ledger: Any and all transactions are stored in the public view.
 * Fees: The transfer of bitcoin across the globe is almost instant and extremely cheap.
 * Unique: It's very difficult to forge or duplicate bitcoin
 * Decentralized: Many thousands of volunteers use computing power at their disposal to run the bitcoin network.
In most other regards is almost the same as paper currency. It's mostly anonymous but traceable, it's susceptible of being stolen, it's subject of speculation, can only be spent once, etc.
Bitcoin has everything to become a very important part of the Information Age. The underlying concepts and technology of bitcoin show a lot of promise to continue to innovate and propose fixes for the real and perceived flaws in the current monetary system. 
All of this has happened before. The web, email, open source software, fax, telephone and electricity before them and a vast array of other solutions have been created with grandiose and extremely unlikely goals just as bitcoin and many have succeeded.
