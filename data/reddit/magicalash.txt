Multisig currently is used mostly for spreading addresses about over places, imo it should be used everywhere though.

We would have much bigger problems if  the government was doing anything like that. It is possible though. The US along by that point would not control 51% of the population of bitcoin users.

I view the market cap as the average price excluding outliers, so in my view, no. Some people view it as that though. Market cap can be very misleading.

If you have the private keys (needed to spend) they they're recoverable.

Gox has a backup of Usd withdrawals of ~6 months and have for quite a while now. Do some research before using an exchange. :P

Tsa: Have you got any bitcoin on you?
Person: I have a private key in my arm.
Tsa: Like a tattoo? We need to examine that.
Person: No, like its IN my arm.
Tsa: Welp, guess we need to cut you open and extract your wallet.
Kidding of course, but this is why im never putting private keys or anything else in/on me. :p

Oh noes! I ate mah private keys! :3

Linear/Exponential extrapolation doesn't work very well here. Prices have to flatline somewhere, and its not really possible for the 21M coins be worth more than the economy. 
Edit: Missed the sarcasm, oops. :P

Have your wallet rescan for unused coin.

Yup! I think this has already been implemented in a wallet, not sure though. A similar (And probably better) way to do this is to use a multisig address.

Its a backup tape, not a harddrive. These things are crap for anything but archiving.

The website looks up the address in the blockchain, if it isn't there it shows as a balance of 0. As for containing all private keys, there isn't enough room in the universe to hold 2^256 of anything. Also, public keys are derived from the private key, not vice versa.

Its open source, anyone can edit it. The lead devs decide what to put in to the reference client, If they do something deemed bad or unfavored, miners just don't update. Devs can be replaced.

Kraken is actually registered with FinCEN and other regulatory agencies. Bitstamp is not AFAIK.

After googling for a bit, I can't find anything. I may try to pull something together with python or something, never done anything with python before though. Btw, Multisig addresses are fairly normal addresses, most wallets accept them iirc.

Government regulation typically ups the requirements for entry and blocks out legit startups. It also has a tendency to fail/ not work efficiently. As for private regulation, while not easily done, would probably work with a bit more decency. Kinda like how SSL works, private companies give certificates of authenticity. You can work without them, people just might not trust you.
I personally support private regulation, even if a bit more expensive.
