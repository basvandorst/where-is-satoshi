Funny, as usual the get richer and you guys are sitting here congratulating them....
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:59:45
Same goes for Reddits sense of humor judging by the downvotes.

Aww man, sorry for your loss. RIP Bro!
I know how he felt. I mean not that I ever had 15,000 BTC, but I lost 50 in a hack in 2014. Im kicking myself every day for not educating myself properly in the first place. If i did, id have never left them there in the first place. I didnt know it was a bad idea to keep your money in an exchange. :(
Lesson learned the hard way unfortunately. Not sure id be suicidal even if it was 15,000 coins tho.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:15:47
Correct, infact we have just been informed of the names of the miners involved: Wi-Go Bwoke, Go Tno Muny, Khan Tafor Dit and of course the infamous Airline pilots Ho Le Fook and Sum Ting Wong.

Bitcoin cant help at all. How the hell do I spend it if nobody accepts it. Bitcoin is not a replacement for cash and never will be until the majority accept it for day to day transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-28 00:49:34
Exactly, Id be contacting my Solicitor and not paying another cent until its clear this will be my property at the end of the mortgage.
@_date: 2015-06-12 03:36:29
Your friend is about to go broke.
@_date: 2014-10-08 05:52:02
Why a non exit node?
@_date: 2014-12-06 06:59:18
But the story itself has absoloutly nothing to do with bitcoin other than it was used to donate to him. Not sure it should be posted here.
@_date: 2014-12-06 05:44:09
Good on him for standing up for himself and his rights.
But what does this have to do with Bitcoin exactly other than the community wanting to help him in some way?
@_date: 2014-09-26 08:34:59
Why would it just "go away"? Is there some talk of shutting it down or something?
@_date: 2014-10-09 05:59:48
Whats with the attitude?
I ask a legit question and your acting like a dick.
We cant all be bitcoin and tor geniuses like you.
@_date: 2014-12-16 06:47:55
I believe that should be 360.
@_date: 2014-11-15 00:28:33
Isnt linking your bank account to bitcoin transactions counter-productive to the whole idea?
@_date: 2014-10-08 12:32:25
Yer so Id assume not checking it makes it an exit node.
@_date: 2014-12-06 07:36:03
Judging by the downvotes, you guys arent getting my meaning. 
Id have thought it should be posted to whatever sub handles people standing up for their rights or police harassment or even news would be more appropriate.
Can I now make a post about every purchase I make with bitcoin. For example if I buy some retro games with bitcoin do I post it to retrogaming or bitcoin?
I paid my webhosting bill with bitcoin this month, should I make a post about it?
If I take a photo of a Walmart Whale and he happens to be wearing a bitcoin t-shirt can I now post it here??
Do you get what I mean? If some thing involves bitcoin in any way what so ever, can it be posted here? Isnt this sub more for News and information about bitcoin itself rather than anecdotal stories that happen to include it in some way?
@_date: 2014-12-26 00:22:22
But it is a scam!!!
^^^Thanks ^^^for ^^^the ^^^cash ^^^Tommy
@_date: 2014-10-08 10:52:20
huh? The software doesnt allow you to act as an exit node? Then why a check box for it?
@_date: 2014-11-27 05:38:53
Sorry, but im sick of the "lets not link to it because thats what they want" attitude. Probably fair enough when thats obviously what they want, or the organisation is well known for their click bait, but that doesnt seem to be the case.
Not directed particually at this OP, but at people who have this attitude in general. I dont care if you dont want to give them traffic, I want to read their side of the story. Refusing to link makes me think you dont want people to decide for themselves whats going on and just accept your opinion.
@_date: 2014-11-15 04:25:30
So how does he buy regular stuff from now on? Are the bitcoin ATMs everywhere in the Philippines?
@_date: 2014-10-10 05:58:39


Ive always viewed it at intentionally leaving out words, generally insults.
@_date: 2014-10-09 11:25:25
ok sorry then, I just took your ...s as impatience or leaving out expletives wich is generally what it represents.
@_date: 2017-03-08 03:52:59
I thought this was pretty well know and basically accepted?
Now that "the cats out of the bag" are you all going to stop using Windows? Im guessing for an overwhelming majority, the answer is no! So of course nothing will be done and in a week or 2, everyone will forget until the next time its brought up. When people will again act outraged, yet stick with windows. Its a vicious cycle that wont end till people do more than just complain.

"See mom I told you the CIA put that porn on my computer, isnt that right Dad."
"Spot on Son, that dam CIA and their porn injections..."
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:15:16
Your right, but they wont understand, they never do. Everyone is acting all shocked and outraged like they do with other similar issues (NSA spying for example) but do nothing and forget about it within a few weeks.
Personally I refuse to change OS just because of this. Why? because in the same room here theres multiple Android phones, A Samsung Smart TV, PS3, PS4, XBox360, XBONE, WiiU and a couple of Laptops. Even if I secure my PC, all the other devices are still vulnerable.
Not to mention the Linux kernel is also under question, so really what you gunna do? Going dark is about the only thing you can do.

A $1 coffe gets $3 in network fees? 
Now insted of paying a small amount in Bank fees, u now pay Network fees. I dont mind, if the fee was fair, but this is 350% the price of the item.
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:38:43
I can. But whats the risk factor? I constantly read about exchanges doing a runner with peoples bitcoin or wallets being compromised. Is there a reliable way to buy and "store" it? 
I dont trust any of these dodgy looking websites, especially the ones here in Oz.
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:54:06
Yer I might. I might just do the old buy it and forget about it and check in in a few years, but i really have no idea how to go about it. Other than an investment, i have no real use for it at the moment.
I just looked at the Trezor and leger nano and they just confused the fuck out of me. Why would I need a piece of hardware to store a bunch of numbers. Cant I just write my key down and stash it? Using some kind of hardware device, wouldnt I need to keep it charged? 
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:00:07
Yer see I still dont quiet get it, you have to recieve the key some how, electronically I would assume. So you go to an exchange, buy some coin and they give you a key. That key is already being sent to me over the internet to a computer or phone, is that not vulnerable? Can I just write it down and call it a day? 
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:09:31
So as someone with a passing interest in bitcoin, yet no REAL understanding of it all. If I had 1k spare, should I just buy some bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-08-08 04:59:03
Since when is there "licences" in bitcoin? Seems to defeat the whole purpose.
@_date: 2015-08-08 06:04:55
And people are going along with this, why?
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:00:58
I wish i still had the free 50 I got back in the day. Thought they were safe in an exchange. Lesson learnt.
@_date: 2015-08-08 06:13:54
The whole point of bitcoin is its decentralised. Nobody controls it or has power over it. How does the US Govt suddenly have some kind of control to issue licensing?
@_date: 2015-08-08 23:24:25
Looks to me like they have no power over bitcoin itself, so are trying to control the people who use it.
@_date: 2015-07-05 05:16:57
For about 20 mins and its down again.
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:33:03
Yes Grandpa. And remember to leave it to me. ;)
@_date: 2017-04-20 07:01:00
He would have been better off saying everyone was walking around with a device full of encrypted CP. Just because something is possible, doesnt give you the right to take away people liberties.
No EVERYONE is not walking around with a swiss bank account. Less than 0.01% of people have any bitcoin. Not quiet everyone Obama...
Its like saying "All Males above 14 COULD be a terrorist, so we are making laws that stop them going out after 5pm."
Imagine Trump said "Ive heard all Former Presidents could potentially become enemy informants, today I pass a new law that makes all Former POTUS live together on an isolated island surrounded by the Navy for their protection and Security"
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:03:44
Definetly. I could print and emboss this in about 15mins with about $5 with of materials. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:02:51
Well thats possibly one of the better memes ive seen on here, but still im getting a bit sick and tired of these memes. Every time BC makes a move in ANY direction, all u guys do is post memes.
Im betting theres a bunch of people right now with the meme already made and ready to click submit for when it hits 9000 again. No, just dont. 
This sub is turning in to the meme playground for crypto kiddies with 1 or 2 GPUs mining nicehash overnight on their gaming PCs... IMO there should be a sub for this shit.
@_date: 2015-04-20 10:09:21
No you are correct. My point is only that his description just makes it sound like any other money that can be traded electronically. Money these days is figures in a computer that are transferred electronically. Paper/Plastic money is just a representation of value but holds no actual value in the material itself.
@_date: 2015-04-11 02:05:58
Ok, so if you suspect teamviewer, how did an attacker get those details?
Does anyone have those details?
Or perhaps you have a keylogger running?
Teamviewer inside job?
Brute force?
@_date: 2015-04-11 01:09:44
But wouldnt an attacker have to know your password? Just having TeamViewer running shouldnt be a problem in itself.
@_date: 2015-09-15 09:33:00
As someone who knows fuck all about the tec behind bitcoin, WTF does all this changing block size mean?
Say im simply a consumer buying and selling with bitcoin. Should I care about the size of the block? If I have 100 bitcoin, how does a changing block size effect those coins if at all?
@_date: 2015-04-20 07:42:38
This is no explanation. This makes it sound no different than any currency that can be exchanged electronically. IE regular money.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:10:25
Was he buying and selling drugs or other illegal goods himself?
If no, then no, he shouldnt be locked up, but if he was, then those are the crimes hes being locked up for, not for 'building a website'.

Guess we can make that His Lordship the Honourable Dr. Mr. Prof. Craig Jong-Wright Ph.D PHP L.L.B R.E.S.P.E.C.T Supreme Leader of North Korea.
@_date: 2016-05-05 07:08:47
I suspected the whole block size debate has been spured on by the banking industry to create a rift in the bitcoin community, and im not really all that much in to it. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 05:48:37
This is why Im not so keen on bitcoin at the moment. Its all the rage right now and so many people who have no idea of the reality of it are trying to get involved. We have all these new bitcoin companies starting up and it seems like 1/2 or more are just scam artists waiting for the right moment to take everyones money.
Nobody deserves to be ripped off, but If you jump into bitcoin without decent understanding of it, you are a fool. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 07:17:21
How many people in Australia gets paid in Bitcoin? Id wager almost none.
In fact, why would you want to get paid in bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:41:58
Sounds like we have a new contender for the leadership of North Korea!!
@_date: 2015-02-28 22:15:18
Exactly. 
Id be more concerned about getting paid $1k in bitcoin and having the value drop to 1/2 that effectively meaning you only earned $500
@_date: 2015-02-25 05:12:39
As someone with only a passing interest in Bitcoin, im not really understanding all this. I though 1/2 the point of Bitcoin was the fact its untracable. I thought you are supposed to be able to buy, transfer and deal in bitcoin completely anonymously. 
Yet people are dealing with banks and handing over their personal information. Doesnt this defeat the purpose entirely?
@_date: 2015-02-01 07:09:41
Too bad nobody else within 100kms uses or even know what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2016-07-04 20:28:37
Nah, from the looks of that death grip cramp, he was just doing something else. ;)
