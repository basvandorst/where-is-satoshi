He’s not suggesting you don’t need to do anything to use LN. He’s saying if you don’t do anything you won’t be using LN and that you will not be forced to use LN if you choose not to do anything.

Please check out [Liberty in North Korea]( 
This organization brings North Korean refugees on an incredibly dangerous journey to freedom but they can only save as many people as they can afford. Donating to this organization you can be assured that for every $3000 dollars donated someone’s life goes from one of the worst possible situations to one of the best. With LiNK you’re directly contributing to increased global freedom.

Because I laugh at the Presidents jokes? I mean sometimes Obama made me laugh too does that mean I support him?

They’re pretty much the same thing. He also attends and sponsors Anarchapulco which I guess is a big ancap meet up in Mexico.

That’s exactly what it is insured for. It’s FDIC insured like a bank.

Idk man I wouldn’t consider myself a Trump supporter and I’ve always thought Pocahontas was kinda funny.

Yeah maybe if we get a socialist in office it’ll speed up adoption like it has in Venezuela.

Coinbase is only insured for USD. Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum are not insured.

If not a currency then what is Bitcoin trying to be? 
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:32:05
But it would work and you wouldn’t need to post questions on Reddit to figure out how to pay. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:39:39
But one works and the other doesn’t. They’re both trying to achieve the same goal but one literally is incapable of functioning. Why not use the one that functions at least until the other project gets things worked out.

You get the guys that know the corruption better than anyone to deal with the corruption.

Unless you mention Bitcoin Cash ��, amirite?

Which other “scam coins” has Roger Ver endorsed? 
As far as I’m aware Roger Ver endorsed Bitcoin very early on and only recently has began endorsing Bitcoin Cash.

Cash is not the first fork Bitcoin Classic was before Bitcoin Cash. There could have been others too but I am not sure.

You don’t need to fry the whole globe to cripple bitcoin. You can’t transact BTC without electronics. If the part of the world you’re in is fried you’re shit out of luck.

It’s also 100% not going to be easy even if it was found and mined the cost of the operation will be ridiculous. But Elon Musk mentioned mining asteroids one time and everyone now thinks it’s just around the corner.

Very high quality comment. I applaud the effort you must have put in to think of something so original.

You would not believe how many people have told me gold is a bad investment because “it’s only 15 years until we mine it in space.” 
I’ve heard this both in real life and on Reddit too many times.

Full honesty I think fortune favors the rational.
Crypto and stocks are not substitutes. Portfolio diversity is good. Diving headfirst into what is essentially uncharted territory might not be the best financial decision. I mean, it could be but it’s definitely high risk and your ability to afford to lose your entire investment should be considered.

He said himself in an interview he wishes people wouldn't judge him but what he once was but by what he is now. Then reminded the interviewer that he's been a civil servant far longer than he was a banker.

Why does anybody need an ATM. 
What we need is merchants accepting Bitcoin.

Former member of the Socialist Party of France. He switched to their more centrist party later but that's because the party was erupting and he knew he could get places. He's also incredibly pro-EU. So take that information as you will but Im very skeptical of this guy. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 21:08:46
If the EU were solely an economic union it'd be wonderful. Maybe even a forum for discussing issues the entire continent is effected by. In reality it's an undemocratic institution that delegates laws down to member states without regard for the liberties of those states.
