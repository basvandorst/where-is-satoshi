I think the exact opposite. Anyone can write for Forbes online (for a fee). 
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:56:31
When did he say this?
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:42:22
Great to hear ��
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:31:23
CNBC can suck it
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:30:03
Does anyone have an estimated time frame for when this will be out? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:17:15
Really... When did you open? Recently?
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:45:15
Where can you find these?
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:08:34
Personally I think this is a step in the right direction. Customer relations = customer support 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:09:10
I agree 100%
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:46:25
Thanks. I’d like to hear his thoughts today
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:31:48
Damn. I’m only on day 10...
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:45:04
How’s their customer support? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:27:42
Not a lot of substance there...
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:43:15
Criminals favorite currency is USD
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:31:27
That’s the conservative approach. The IRS has not clarified this.

@_date: 2017-12-23 15:25:18

Good luck. I think this is a great idea ��

Yeah. WTF?!?! 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:40:06
Bitcoin is money
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:12:17
Is he saying bitcoin is good?
@_date: 2018-08-31 01:14:52
2.5% expense ratio... It’s an interesting idea, but I’ll pass
@_date: 2018-05-02 10:29:57

Why 21? What's the significance?
@_date: 2017-02-16 00:20:43
21m... why should I watch this?

Who is this guy? Where is he from? NSA?
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:50:46
I held ETH on an exchange when they hard forked. I ended up receiving both ETH and ETC. 
That said, if a hard fork creates 2 different BTC chains, what would happen to my coins in cold storage? Would I be able to spend them on both chains? 
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:37:27
Cheers. I'm with you on this. Bitcoin is my sub from now on
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:06:30
What's a "laid patent"?
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:07:45
Not really. Inflation decreases over time...
That said. I prefer the hard cap on 21M. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:24:01


Can we evolve? Are there any cryptocurrencies out there that can withstand quantum computing? Maybe only the centralized ones (shudder at the thought)?

When those freinds start buying, it's time to sell. (Not everything, but some for profit)

@_date: 2017-11-07 16:26:08
I couldn't find any posts specific to paper wallets. I guess one option is to just hold and spend on which ever chain is worth more at the time then?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:41:08
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:46:24
I use the Blockchain app, but only for BTC that I plan to spend. It’s convenient having a wallet on your phone :)
That said, I wouldn’t recommend it for any coins you plan to hold for a while. I’d look into a hardware wallet (depending on the amount of BTC)
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:26:34
Yes. This is what I'm looking for
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:09:39
This is what you call a free ride in the gambling world. Great bet by the roommate.

We just need to convert speculators to users then :)
This is a new asset class. With time and education, everyone will eventually realize this.

When you’re so wrong on Trump, it’s hard to trust your opinion on anything. Sorry man
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:20:35
Do a search of this sub. There are legit people who will help you recover them 
Maybe search the ETH sub too
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:39:45
Ha. This statement makes me completely disregard everything else you just said. 
World leaders do not respect Trump. Many just play to his ego in order to placate and manipulate him.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:27:42
Thanks. I'm glad to hear that a tools will be available. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:11:19
What are the odds of OP paying if he loses in 2020? OP obviously doesn’t have $4k now, or else he would have invested it himself. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:35:38
Why would you ask a stupid question when I’m talking about posters over here?
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:20:55
Wouldn't we see a big price drop if China exits the market?
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:55:00
Can you exchange Bitcoin for USD in those? Or just buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:22:01
Questioned answered
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:07:52
It’s not very probable. 60% corrections are rare, and no one can predict the market

Contest winners... 
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:16:34
Yep. BTC created this whole thing. 
BTC is to crypto like gold is to precious metals.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:23:50
Love it! I hope you do well
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:01:56
But you can buy things with Bitcoin or exchange it at any time, so it's really not

Are 5 INR bills outlawed in India? I remember that India recently removed a lot of cash from society, in an effort to force people to use banks
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:37:29
Impressive start. And publishing on CNBC gets you some good, free publicity right out the gate (which is a huge advantage). 
Are all profits donated forever? In theory you can own this business for years. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:34:48
If they have meetings... most people have meetings everyday 
That said, I would never wear a BTC tie. A guy I know wore a Jets tie once, and people are still laughing about it years later. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:55:44
I work in finance and lived a block from the exchange for years before heading to the burbs. Maybe we just run in different circles 
When I started out, I never wore a tie. Now I do almost day
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:34:27
Great for Gemini!
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:11:42

They can do it now. It’s just very expensive. It’s cheaper to mine it
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:35:37
This is a very interesting point. Coins coming from a sanctioned company in Russia for instance could be considered tainted and have less value in the US. And what happens if you receive these second or third hand (after the Russian company)? 
This reminds me of the tainted coin problem that NEM currently has 
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:29:13
Ha. Great title. This literally made me lol
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:20:43
Most high level finance people wear ties. No one in tech does, but Wall Street certainly likes ties
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:16:02
To convert BTC to fiat via an exchange and then receive fiat in a bank account. I don't want everything kept in BTC
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:54:16
Yeah. Nevada
