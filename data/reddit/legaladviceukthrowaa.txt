Should be quick? There's nearly 200k unconfirmed transactions! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:09:36
I'd like to move some of my Bitcoins back into GBP. They're on Mycelium at the moment. Is it worth even trying to move them back to Coinbase? Or does the transaction backlog render this pointless?

6000k? Wow $6 million is a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:30:53
Bitcoin goes up 1k and back down 1k in the space of 10 minutes "it seems stable now".

Why are you adding a dollar sign?

Aaaaaah an online celeb! I'm so excited. This is better than that time a girl got stuck throwing her poo out of a date's bathroom window, and then appeared in the thread about it.

Weasel. Because weasels are flexible and can move in tight spaces.

Good grief.

It's funny how this will make it nowhere near or because it doesn't fit the "Germany = leaders of the free world" agenda.
If the USA did this, holy shit we'd never hear the end of it.

It literally has London in its name. My car doesn't pick it up and I've never listened to it.

Their returns policy has nothing to do with the law.

Well no shit, my question is how much faster?
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:19:46
I have no blinking idea what to do anymore. I was really surprised when it smashed past $11k, and would have sold if I wasn't at work. As it started dropping I swore that I'd sell again the minute it went back to $11k. Yet here I am, not selling.
Where is it going to end up? I'm amazed that enough people are buying at the moment to keep it rising.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:58:03
I don't think selling 100 at $1000 each is a bad financial decision. No one could have foreseen Bitcoin reaching these heights. I'd have cashed out long before then!

Hurble flurble *unintelligible throat noises*
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:28:14
I'm certainly OVER them... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:33:16
Back up to $10k now. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:25:29
It's 5000€, jeeze, hold it. I have 500000 £ worth and I haven't even broke a sweat. This is basic stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:34:31
Does LTC have as much support from companies? Ethereum, IOTA + Monero are always the coins that I think have the most chance of being feasible in the real world.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:21:05
But you already pay a fee on Coinbase... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:19:47
Is this a copypasta? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:00:18
I wouldn't put on a bet with a friend that I'd still be their friend in 2020. If this is serious, this is stupid.

1. should be your first stop if you have suddenly come into a lot of money. Their sidebar FAQ is a great start. They're unlikely to recommend having more than 10-20% of your savings in crypto. It's all about your appetite for risk, but that's the percentage I go for too. 
2. Why would your "friend" sell you something for less than it's worth? Never mix money and friends.
3. Does your friend really have 100BTC? That's a lot of money. That's "please have it sent to my beach house" money. Alarm bells should be ringing.

Let's beat this drop first...

Surely legally they have to refund you in your original payment currency? I'd ask @_date: 2017-11-30 21:21:38

Is there any way I can go back in time so that I never have to read your comment again?
