What is causing it to go down? I hope it starts to boom again. December it started slacking makes me sad. I hope this time next year it'll have 10,000% increase along with other ones.

what does this mean?

lower transaction fees and faster transfer times are ideal.

Wow! I hope someone donates bitcoin to me! it'll put me out of debt. No Lambo's for me.

I wonder how long till bitcoin get to the millions...
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:13:10
That doesn't seem safe lol if everyone can look it up. Is it possible someone to hack it if they know the balance?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:21:58
Thanks, lets hope it'll be life-changing in a year's time. lol

I've read comments that it will crash like the stock market in the great depression.... It's just hard to see where it'll go. I mean stores are adopting it right? And the further are a step forward no?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:22:05
How can you be so sure?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:31:17
So this is pretty much the end of bitcoin or the beginning of the end?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:12:10
Ah I see, so on Coinbase it seems they give you a new address every time. Does that mean the previous address doesn't work or its one of the addresses that is associated with my account?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:56:04
Hahah and at one lump sum at that too! We gotta make it one way.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:08:45
What are the chances bitcoin devs actually implement this?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:54:53
Wow! So informative! thank you so much.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:38:53
Is here a chance the protocol will change and fix the transaction fees? I hear there's big disagreement with the developers. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:01:32
Yeah but that seems risky if you ask me lol. I don't know much of Public key, Private key but something about it doesn't seem right.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:50:47
I'm trying! Hahah I just don't want serious gains that I can have a nice Jumpstart on things. $50k would be great lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:50:04
Coinbase doesn't reveal private keys right? Only public keys only to send money?
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:19:25
Ohhh that's interesting. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:10:11
You could send it to me. 1NiAJNweTXDaUCg98jfLARUswH98GFTFt

If you're buying Bitcoin on Coinbase and don't take money out how are gonna pay taxes if it isn't capital gains yet?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:57:20
Yeah I bought some Ethereum litecoin and IOTA. They're my hope for another year or so 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:54:26
Wow! I did manage to buy some alts but not much. Some Ethereum, I have 1.09 litecoin lol. Bought 24 MIOTA.  Those are my gambles. 
@_date: 2019-12-07 02:20:51
I don't see it happening again... It was manipulated
@_date: 2019-12-15 02:18:52
So has there been anything promising happening with bitcoin? Any change it'll have it's next boom?
