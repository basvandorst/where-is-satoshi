Putting your incredibly offensive language to the side for a moment i'd like to first point out that if you re-read my comment, "stupid" was never mentioned or implied.  
Secondly, a quick google search shows that your absolutists claim of "NO ONE" is just plain wrong - Exhibit [A]( [B](

Hey man, its unfortunate my comment had to spoil your Monday but the fact is poor is a very subjective term.  For all you know (most likely not but still) those bills could be for the overpriced 50" TV he bought on Black Friday knowing full well he didn't need it.  All i'm saying is sometimes it takes a little sacrifice to reap great rewards, this is simply what i was pointing out. If you truly believe in something and call yourself an "enthusiast", then its not fairy dust.  
I've probably seen more than $10 in change on the side of the street in the last 7 years. The fact you were so offended by such a claim blows my mind.  u/Garland_Key - dm me your btc address and i'll send you the $10 today and get you started if that all thats keeping you from joining the movement, and u/Bawkol, instead of telling strangers to fuck off on the internet, maybe you'd want to join me

You got me there. I live in a city that’s jaded me on the price of a meal. The anecdote still applies regardless of $10 or $1 tho

eh, somewhat true, but Ver is a pretty powerful player in this space, and if the bitcoin community was silent, they could very well be overtaken by him and his cronnies.  This just isn't the fact with Bitcoin Gold
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:44:20
I do find it interesting and alarming the rapid acceleration in market value of some of these compared to what they have demostarted product-wise.  Its also important to keep in mind this is an emerging global asset class that has potential to redefine global market structure, rather than just a passive investment in a company such as FB. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 18:27:20
As much as I agree with you and feel the market sentiment has changed in the past few weeks to a pre-bullish attitude.... looking purely at chart dynamics (   if BTC fails to bounce past 11,500 in the next couple of weeks, the pullback has it landing somewhere in the $4500 range.  This would just be a basic continuation of the bear trend and if i've learned anything from my time in crypto, anything is possible and just when you think you have an idea of whats happening next, buckle up

This is so wrong... currency is an inherently tradable asset.  Jesus look at the $70trillion Forex market. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:20:13
Not "all", but the few isolated to countries with rampant political corruption (ie Venezuela &amp; Zimbabwe).  Forex markets have been a trading hotbed for literally decades and are completely uncorrelated with these few rare cases.  I see the crypto market joining them side by side as a global asset class as well as a usable currency. However this is years down the line (5-10)

@_date: 2018-06-19 15:19:12
Dude, its not a shill, and its actually really scary that no one, including yourself can even remotely argue a sound case in which BTC stands up to these seemingly superior technologies down the line.  My opinion is once they have time to flourish as BTC has they will stand side by side as equal assets in the space.  
Calling out something as a shameless shill and providing no counter argument as to why you believe this or other related projects are shitcoins is a weak argument and should make everyone in this sub very nervous - its flat out ignorant.  Suppression of free speak and competitive dynamics is a death sentence to innovation.
 I simply asked for an educated response as to why this community is not phased by emerging tech and how you feel BTC will prosper in a space flooded with both good and bad alternatives. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:37:12
I specified "from a tech perceptive" because i feel this is the only this BTC doesn't have on other techs in the community.  It's more established by age, users, and has first mover advantage.  I get this, and this is why i specified tech, so i didn't get answer i already knew. 
In terms of tech, yes i'm a novice to this industry, but even with LN, BTC has transaction fees, takes more than 20 minutes to go from wallet to wallet, and is extremely detrimental to the environment.  This leads me to believe it is not the best tech on the market and quite a few emerging options would put it's tech to shame.

Typically trying to stay within the top 50 as those are a bit more established - plus that names Byteball Bytes is a tough one to market hahaha. From the outside looking in, it seems like a no brainier that these DAG techs (NANO, IOTA, Byteball Bytes like you said) are superior in many ways, but their is obviously an argument for the bitcoin minimalist to believe Bitcoin is here to stay regardless of it's emerging second gen competitors, and i cam here to hear that side.

I dont really care tbh.  Whatever month you look at, just hold for 2+ years and you'll be in the green. This hasn't failed in the last decade. 
Months should be irrelevant. Think in years.

The thing I've always been curious about was that anyone can see right into your wallet though.   Imagine if you could just google someone's name or bank account and look inside, see where he/she is using their money, where it's coming from, etc.  Are their wallets or 2nd layer option available that add a certain privacy layer this?

Think about the capital that will have to be injected to the market for this to occur...  As price compounds, so does the difficultly of having parabolic prices increases... 
A $1 Million BTC means has a $21trillion MC, aka 1/5 of entire world monetary supply... and $10million BTC would mean $210trillion MC, or 2x the enitre global market

think he meant USD
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:50:27
You see what you did their right, you counted the supply of BTC vs the value of fiat... imagine if we just counted every single bill in circulation as 1 unit, not account for the difference between value and supply ($1, $5, $10, $100 etc.) 
So really it should be $70trillion vs $126billion (21mil BTC) or more realistically the entire crypto market cap (~$235billion)  and once this rises into the 1-5 trillion mark over the coming year or two, it will be absorbed as part of the growing $70 trillion market
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:09:42
Can you elaborate on why you feel that way - is it a shitcoin in your opinion because it has yet to prove it has the bandwidth to compete with the top payment coins or because DAG tech like Nano, Iota, and GByte as u/i_gotta_say said above pose a threat to Bitcoin's tech? 
Not designed to be a shill, I just figured this is the sub that would provide the best pro-BTC argument to counter the narrative out their that superior tech is emerging and just needs time to blossom as BTC did over the last 9 years.
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:19:49
I see it as helpful to the new readers and retail investors here who don't have financial background and understand how price and market cap correlate both how and why saying $10mil per bitcoin is is a factually delusional statement, and dangerous to new investors who see this as a possible price target. 
With the current information gap in crypto, Reddit is a primary source of "research" for fa too high amount of people.  We need to be careful what we say and call out bullshit when we see it.
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:42:07
Thanks for this, first insightful answer I've gotten. I've always heard that that DAGs do sacrifice some sense of security to increase efficiency, is their a solution for this in the works that you know of? 
Also how are they working to change this 51% voting weight - does this occur simply by building out more nodes in the network? 
@_date: 2019-08-09 04:31:25
You can have sell orders set on coinbase while having that coin stored on a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:30:19
But you wont tell me why or what you believe is a shitcoin!  I think it's you who isn't understanding what i'm saying.  I'm not shilling a damn thing, i haven't mentioned a single coin in 2 responses and only listed well known DAG alternatives as overt competitive examples. I could replace those with XLM, LTC, XMR, DASH, etc. and my argument remains the same. 
This convo is an all-time screenshot though that truly highlights the scary trend in this community. The American political ideology is seeping into crypto and ignorance and misinformation seems to be overpowering truth and fact. You sound like a very angry and irritable dude, but dont worry, i'm sure BTC will rise in the coming months (along with many shitcoins and legitimate projects) so you can be a bit happier.

I didn't come here to educate on the intricacies of one coin vs the other nor did i claim to be an expert.  At what it sets out to do, and the scope of the question i originally asked (regarding everyday payment transfers) I simply wanted to start a discussion on why the BTC community sees their product as advantageous over Nano whose technology has proven to be a faster and cheaper transfer of assets than an older technology in BTC. And i seemed to get a consensus answer - security concerns 
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:39:43
In light of their recent bitgrail debacle, it's my understanding that was caused by a coding error within the exchange, not the coin's code itself.  That's like saying you can't trust BTC security because of Mt. Gox

The argument of ubiquity seems a bit hypocritical at this stage in crypto.
That's like me saying why would you ever used BTC when you have the ubiquity of cash and credit. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:34:51
And minus utilizing an entirely different technology than block chain.  They're completely different technologies with similar us cases. And from my understanding Nano hasn't begun mass-marketing until their product is tested further under stress and more wallets are built. 
You are right that BTC does more than Nano now, but Nano does the one thing it was created to do better than anyone and that's fast and feeless transferring of wealth. In the future if the devs choose to, they can build smart contracts on top of Nano and make it a two layer service.  But for now it seems theyre focusing on being better than BTC at the everyday transfers that would bring both to the mainstream

@_date: 2018-04-21 02:25:42
I can tell this is coming from a privileged bias.  The Gini Coefficient of BTC and cryptocurrnecy is weighted at .89 meaning an extremely large gap in wealth distribution being highly in favor of a few rich possessing much more than the poor masses (to compare USA is at a .45 and we are considered to have radical wealth gaps between rich and poor). Only the wealthy can get there hands on this. Veeeery different from socialism. Honestly quite the opposite. More of a feudal French or ancient Roman feel.

@_date: 2018-04-20 22:45:24
Absolutely. Beyond the factors I mentioned above that contribute to volatility, the mechanisms itself that the stock market functions on in 2018 is complex code. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:36:36
I’m sorry but I strongly disagree with that. Beyond the code, it’s an emerging global asset class. The entire stock market can be boiled down to code in theory but we all know it’s much more complicated than just that.  The reason is new money coming in at greater rates then sells are happening so investors must climb the sell ladder in order to fill their orders to be filled. This is the reason for increase it price. That is just simply economics 101. On top of this, reasons for increase in price can range from improvement of core functioning (ie lighting network), adoption (more and more people not involved seeing it emerge in commerce), and government acceptance... among many others.  So to refute your claim, there are many reasons beyond speculation to see a price increase/decrease.
