You can get that feeling if u just read the first sentences, but if u keep reading u will see he has in my eyes a pretty good understanding of fees and block sizes.

The problem is u can never have a substantial discussion with the dogecoin guys...

China with the fake news and rumours crashing prices? What year is it?
@_date: 2014-04-24 17:39:10
Yes but as he mentions the media attention played propably a big role as well.
@_date: 2014-04-21 20:20:31
Good job guys! I didnt have an account at Vault of Satoshi but the constant good news u bring makes me create one right now!
@_date: 2014-07-17 22:53:32
So i convinced a local merchant to accept bitcoin and he isnt willing to fulfill this Bitlicense bullshit, so what is he supposed to do? Just make a popout that if u are from NY he sadly wont be able to accept his bitcoins? Or sth. else? And what if someone is from NY and still after the warning continues to purchase sth? 
Sry im not from the USA so i dont get why anyone would deal with that shit and dont understand it either.

Ouh my first Tip...i will carry ur massage into the world of Reddit =)
@_date: 2014-08-07 10:06:56
I agree with u that was somewhat very exaggerated, but i think his point is why would satoshi or another early developer cash out? They supported this project cause they believed in the need of a trustless payment system and they are certainly aware that if they sell off they could create a panic. All in all i dont see anyone of them risking this invention and we wont see a sell off these coins in the near future.

First and last question =)
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:34:14
That was just like the first battle in what will be a long war....
@_date: 2014-11-12 11:24:42
I could have believed that but not after 200k Bitcoins had to be found by the community...else he would have run of with them as well.
I mean u can excuse much with stupidity but not that they just "found" 200k bitcoin lying around in a wallet....before i declare my company public bankrupt i check everything possible where the money of my customers could be.
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:38:00
Im honest...im just here for some free bits =)
@_date: 2014-05-07 13:38:44
Only post on this account with no proof...w/e to the moon!
@_date: 2014-06-08 09:34:20
Exact my thoughts...most people just cant do anything about it cause we dont have an Asic =(
@_date: 2014-07-27 22:21:28
Everytime i enter the PIN i get the following Error: 
"PIN Server Error.
There was an error validating the PIN code with the server.This may be because you are not connected to the internet or blockchain.info is currently down. How would u like to proceed?
Enter Password/Try again."
I get this everytime i enter the PIN and i have a working Internet connection etc. When i enter the Password it works but still annoying....anyone else had the same problem and knows what to do?
@_date: 2014-06-05 12:12:38
I already wonderd what the green candle was about =)
@_date: 2014-10-05 09:23:33
He is probably refering to his Start coin isnt he?
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:07:39
Arent this numbers the same for all 4 big rises in bitcoin history? So if ur calculation is true it never should have risen to 1,2k after the last "big" rise in april anyways....
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:56:59
I'm also on Bitstamp and never received one. Checked my spam folder nothing , too.
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:47:09
At least u entertained me.
@_date: 2014-06-08 18:00:46
Always when i reald old posts like this(i just joined bitcoin in 2013) im feeling incredible excited. Its like seeing history in its making, i wonder myself "at that time did they even imagine how far they could come in such a short time?" Someone else got the same feeling or am i just crazy =)
@_date: 2014-09-20 10:12:06
Is break.com supposed to be a news site? It definetly doesnt look like one...
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:53:49
Great we dont even have to do anything...paypal fucks up all by  itself!
@_date: 2014-11-12 11:01:24
If he wasnt malicious he could help us identify the real thief....but since he refuses to do so there arent many other possibilites left.
@_date: 2014-11-12 11:40:29
Yeah I am not trying to say all exchanges that get hacked were trying to fuck up their costumers...but if i close my exchange and say 800k bitcoins are lost and the community needs like one week to find 200k of these bitcoins without any insider information....then i have to say the line between being dumping and fucking up costumers intentionally gets close....

"There are also worries about bitcoin's volatility: its price in U.S. dollars changes every day. On Wednesday, bitcoin was up 0.4 percent at $514.09 BTC=BTSP."
Thats volatile these days?

They way of attacking(through the unique nature of inital notes if i understand it correct) is very interessting, but if i remember correct they already gave a number of solution. Nevertheless a good Paper worth reading.
@_date: 2014-08-06 13:03:36

He could sign a message with his [Digital signature]( so everyone could check it is indeed satoshi.
@_date: 2014-07-28 10:16:34
Nice it worked. Thank you for ur fast response and dont worry love ur service =)
@_date: 2014-08-19 15:00:31
Are we at that time of the year already again? All 2-3 month the same shit....
@_date: 2014-11-08 22:27:16
@_date: 2014-11-12 12:58:09
I dont know if u even read my comment....i never said he got "caught" or that the community "discovered his hidden cash"...all i said was that the community found the coins through examination of old bitcoin adresses used by Mt.Goxine in the past thats a fact and u can read about that....the conclusions out of this are up to u.
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:43:38
If u start worrying u should consider selling at least a part of it....and i wouldnt recommend u gabmling with ur companys assets. Better safe than sorry =)
@_date: 2014-03-20 20:19:59
Funny how a guy that stole thousands of user datas to sell them seems like a good guy next to Karpeles.
@_date: 2014-04-18 11:39:45
I am really sorry for you and all the other employees at Neo &amp; Bee. It seems like u all tried hard to make this work and now u have to deal with this shitty situation...
@_date: 2014-06-16 10:54:21

@_date: 2014-06-16 16:59:40
Yeah its really time for a constructive discussion to solve this matter!
@_date: 2014-07-13 13:37:54
Didnt even notice till my comment. Yay!
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:45:41
Yeah i heard there is a world outside of the US. Some people just seem to forget....
@_date: 2014-11-29 13:53:42
I have no clue of the technical details but wasnt it posted here already multiple times, that using tor to connect to blockchain.info is insecure?
@_date: 2014-08-24 15:32:08
You wrote your opinion now in the post itself in a comment and in a comment on your comment.....dont you think once is enough?
@_date: 2014-05-07 13:56:03
Yes pls =)
@_date: 2014-07-12 22:21:11

So can someone explain what that means for me as customer from europe (if it hast any impact at all). Do they have to give any information of all customers to NY officials or just of NY customers?
@_date: 2015-07-08 10:48:49
Srsly someone posts an e-mail that uber is going to add bitcoin payments and thats enough of a source to write an article about it?
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:35:42
Is everyone in here getting reddit gold?
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:19:14
