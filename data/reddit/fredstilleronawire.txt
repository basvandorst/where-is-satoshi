From the recent changetip discussions I liked [this idea]( by to be able to send changetip a private message with a tip to another reddit user. Apparently this is how the old bot used to work so you could send a private tip without leaving a public comment. Until such a feature exists if you wanted to tip anyone on reddit you could use an old thread to hide a tip. I tried this out a couple of days ago by using last weeks [tipping thread](
Edit: My tip to didn't work, trying again below.

tipped you [140,000 satoshis]( which is actually 1400 bits hence the confusion, 1 bit is 100 satoshis.
* 1.00000000 = 1 BTC
* 0.00000001 = 1 satoshi
* 0.00000100 = 1 bit
* 0.00010000 = 100 bits
1 BTC becomes 1,000,000.00 bits

Cold storage like paper wallets are great but you need a way to eventually spend them safely which means either having a secondary offline computer or to boot into a secure live OS so you can sign transactions.
A hardware wallet like the Trezor essentially gives you a way to safely store and spend from the same wallet just by plugging it into your main OS. The Trezor IMO only has two draw backs which can both be solved with time, the price and the mytrezor.com web wallet. The second will not be an issue when stable builds of Electrum 2 and MultiBit HD are released with support for hardware wallets.
If you have any questions about the Trezor check out IMO its best to spend plenty of time researching all the options before you make up your mind.

It currently works with the mytrezor.com web wallet but other wallet developers are adding support for it. Electrum 2, MultiBit HD are confirmed to have hardware wallet support coming soon and so should Armory.


Like any hierarchical deterministic wallet if someone gets your 12-24 word seed they can steal your bitcoins so keep the back up seed locked away in a secure location(s). With the Trezor you would protect it with a PIN and you can add an additional password too but that is only recommended for advanced users.

If you have any extensions like ad blockers installed try turning them off and see if that helps. Obviously turn them back on when you've finished doing what you need to do with Circle.

Yeah it's very sneaky! If the guy wants to tip 5 cents then they should tip 5 cents, they shouldn't try and make it look like a higher value tip by using fake dollars as a custom moniker.

I haven't played the game but from what I saw in another thread I think you get some free bits for being a new user of the game based on your iOS device. This meant someone was able to spoof new iOS devices to get more free bits.

Does Electrum 2 have full Trezor hardware support? For example is it possible to use Electrum 2 instead of myTrezor.com to set up a blank Trezor with a new seed/PIN, wipe Trezor and restore with another seed?

No, just make sure you have plenty of secure backups of your seed phrase before updating.

It's lightweight and you only need a 12 word seed as a backup for your whole wallet.

Whats your current setup? As long as you've got backups of any seed(s) used then you can restore your wallet(s). I started with a test wallet first and sent it a small amount so I could get familiarised with all the python-trezor commands etc.

# Release 2.0
 * New address derivation (BIP32).
 * New seed phrase format: 8 bits of the seed phrase are used to store
   a version number. The current version number (0x01) refers to the
   default wallet structure. The version number also serves as a
   checksum for the seed, and it will prevent the import of seeds from
   incompatible wallets.
 * Compact serialization format for unsigned or partially signed
   transactions, that includes the master public key and derivation
   needed to sign inputs. This allows to send partially signed
   transactions using QR codes
 * Deterministic Multisig wallets using parallel BIP32 derivations and
   P2SH addresses (2 of 2, 2 of 3).
 * New plugins: 
   - TrustedCoin: two-factor authentication using 2 of 3 multisig and
     Google Authenticator
   - Trezor: support for the Trezor hardware wallet by SatoshiLabs
   - Cosigner Pool: encrypted communication channel for multisig
     wallets, to send and receive partially signed transactions
   - Audio Modem: send and receive transactions by sound
 * Support for BIP70: payment requests
   - Verification of the signature chain uses tlslite.
   - In the GUI, payment requests are shown in the 'Invoices' tab.
 * New 'Receive' tab:
   - create and manage payment requests, with QR Codes
   - the former Receive tab was renamed to 'Addresses'
   - the former Point of Sale plugin is replaced by a resizeable
     window that pops up if you click on the QR code
 * The 'Send' tab in the Qt GUI supports transactions with multiple
   outputs, and raw hexadecimal scripts.
 * The GUI can use the daemon: "electrum -d". The daemon can serve
   several clients. It times out if no client uses if for more than 5
   minutes.
 * More watching-only functionality: Create wallets to monitor any 
   address of choice by entering a list of addresses in the install wizard
 * Wallet files are saved as JSON instead of Python.
 * Client supports servers with SSL certificates signed by a CA.
 * Documentation is now hosted on a wiki:

If Electrum 2 can't do that then you will be able to use MultiBit HD to do it, beta 0.0.5 with full Trezor support is [coming soon](
@_date: 2015-02-12 13:57:40
Just a heads up for anyone interested in the [MultiBit HD beta]( that a new version (0.0.6 beta) will be released shortly with fixes for the Trezor hardware wallet. The 0.0.5 beta had a couple of problems which stopped the Trezor from working correctly.
