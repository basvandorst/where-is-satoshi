the dream is that bitcoin is "digital cash" meaning everyone has bitcoin and just sends it to each other the same way they'd hand them cash, AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, that the bitcoin is accepted at most major retailers so it can be spent like cash can! Bitcoin is great for online sales right now, but for it to truly boom and disrupt tangible paper cash in the next decade, I think it needs to make the crossover to transactions in the physical world

Isn't that the incentive for miners though? How does the network stay supported after new bitcoin is no longer rewarded to miners?

My guess is NEO, because he says something along the lines of "imagine if you could have gotten into ETH before it's meteoric rise earlier this year. What if I told you there is a technology just as promising as ETH that is still heavily undervalued" in his sales pitch.

just don't check the price man. i've held all of my bitcoin for the past 3 years. maybe i'm stupid but it has paid off and I genuinely believe in this technology. This bitcoin might pay off my mortgage in another 10 years.

Altucher is just using that to sell his new crypto course and make money off of people. It's not substantiated by anything. It's literally just him making a guess. The idea originated in this super over the top sales page for his new "get rich quick in crypto" class. You can read it here (warning, super spammy). He's been promoting this new sales pitch a ton on social media and google ads. I've seen it everywhere lately. He's just trying to make a quick buck off of people.
