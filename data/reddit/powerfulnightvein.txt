Oddly enough they are ending this for U.S. customers unfortunately.

at the end of the day I really just want the ppl who sold at 20k to look bad, but even i don't think we'll do that by end of this year.

There's definitely a business idea here. That being said me personally as a software engineer here are some options I'm planning on investigating: 
*write an ifttt applet that checks in and requires you to check in every year. If you don't check in, it sends an encrypted payload of my wallet as an email and requires a password to decrypt. 
*write a cronjob that checks every now and then that I'm alive by asking via a terminal window that will pop up.
*write a python bot that checks online obituary for matching my name plus parents' name. Once it is found, send an email. 
I realize that these are all time release after a period of being dead, but people do need time to grieve before getting greedy. I plan on executing the last two by paying for reserved micro ec2 instances on Amazon with failover.

is there where you can post this?

so many noobish posts lately. I'm anti S2X and bcc/bch, but there's zero point in me reading this and getting excited that a couple noobs all of a sudden understand a small micro-facet of an extremely complicated topic. Study some discrete math and reformulate your arguments OP.

First of all, what kind of software or sites is OP visiting? Or what kind of software did OP download? You don't just get a keylogger on your machine. If you had that many bitcoin at least understand basic cyber security to examine the check sum of the software you download.

I would say start with understanding basic computer science data structures, so go to uni or take a couple MOOCs, understand the Byzantine Generals Problem, etc. Don't just be like those VC idiots who speak out of their arse.
