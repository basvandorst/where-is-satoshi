I'm sure he won't be the last person to either win big or lose it all on investments.

Any investment is a risk. And if you're only willing to risk pennies, you normally only gain pennies. And he has only lost around $10,000 so far. Hardly a huge substantial amount. And it could rebound or he could lose more. Even outside the realm of stocks or the sort, investing in a business is just as risky. Takes money to make money. 
I simply was giving an example of someone I personally know who stands to lose a substantial amount and the risk of suicide of anyone losing a decent amount of money should be taken seriously by loved ones and friends, even if you don't think they will ever do it, it's better safe than sorry and nothing wrong with being there for them if you can help.

But when big market crashes you should always take the threat seriously if you have friends invested in it. And to anyone, 10k isn't enough to kill you. Could just work a second job for a half a year and get it back.

You guys? What exactly did I do that was irresponsible?

Most people who open a business can't afford the start up strictly from savings. And if said business fails, they will more than likely lose more than they could afford to originally invest. And he hasn't lost yet, the market could rebound. You don't sell when you're down.

how would a person know what makes them suicidal or not unless they get to that stage? I'm simply saying that suicide is often related to money, so if you have friends or loved ones who lost money on this deal talk to him make sure they're OK.

You seem still confused. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:01:13
how does anyone afford open up a business if they can take a loan out for the business? isn't that money you don't have?

I didn't invest or lose anything. I said a friend did. And 10,000 won't bankrupt the normal professional person. I have well over that saved. I simply said if you know someone who has lost a decent chunk of change, always offer them help. Money is a big factor for suicide.

Any investment can fail

Yes, it's being a bully to call a person ignorant for calling someone stupid and he should eliminate himself from the gene pool. I'm not sure you know what the term bullying means.

I don't think the suicide hotline thing is ridiculous. I have a friend from college who invested $40,000 when the coins were around $800. At 28 years old it was everything he had to his name and then some. He took money out against his house to invest that much. Now, I think that's iressponisble but if he made money everyone would be clapping for him. But still, he's gonna loss his ass unless it rebounds.

People commit suicide for a multitude of reasons. And one of the largest causes is money. But you sound quite ignorant so you have that going for you at least.

Making monthly payments is much easier than paying $40,000 upfront.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:23:31
So you're saying if you only have $200,00 of the $400,000 needed to open up a business you shouldn't open a business? How do you expect small business to get started?
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:24:05
That's if he sold now. Normally Try to hang on a bit longer to see if it rebounds. Could make it back, could lose more.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:12:48
He didn't bet his house, what kind of house can you get for $40,000? He took a home equity loan and used that money to try to make money. Instead of what most people do, which is just use it to pay bills by living beyond their means.

People have committed suicide for a lot less than their life savings.

I owned my own practice for 3 years before taking a government postition. So I'll just refer to my personal experience.
