No I was just curious more than anything as they mention on the website that you may not be able to install all the apps but don't specify how many!

Is the recieving account based in the UK do you know? My bank charges like £30 to send money internationally which makes coinbase via debit card not seem like such a bad option!

I would usually work out how much leftover income I am likely to have that month and basically go all in with it whenever the price dips slightly that month. If it doesn't dip significantly I'll just buy in toward the end of the month. I'm not saying time the dip here by the way as it is likely that you'll never buy at the lowest price that month. But, as you aren't buying in every week (averaging your cost) I think it's probably a good idea to keep an eye on the price and try to get in at a favourable price for that month. This keeps fees as low as possible for me!

Thanks, exciting times ahead no doubt!

Yes I agree with you on this point. At present my current financial responsibilities permit me to take this approach. If anything changes I would undoubtedly change to a less riskier way of saving!
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:22:30
That's my plan!

I have been lucky there's no disputing that. I'm not suggesting it's the best way of investing, just works out for me at this point in time.
