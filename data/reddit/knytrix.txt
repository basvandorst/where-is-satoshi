Why should they remain nameless?

I'll give you that.  Although, bitcoin has turned into just another means of haves and have nots.

You see what I did there ;)

This is so awesome! Congratulations!

I think I'm going to file a suit against bitcoin for something.  I'll win.

I am suddenly very curious if its different pizza there.   other chains offer variations over seas.  Here its about the worst pizza sauce any chain has.  It tastes like someone mixed piss with garlic.

I seethe with hatred for Nebraska now.  It's not even their fault.

The "debt" is just the money printed plus money... that wasn't printed.  It's not an actual thing.

That's actually legit.  I guess I've been using the phrase to mean "nobody's going to like this, but fuck you hear it comes anyway".  I should just use the latter.

i have a radeon 7970.  I've mined with it before, maybe 7-9 months ago.  I've reformatted since then, and now that i'm attempting again, it doesn't seem to work.
It appears to connect, but doesn't /do/ anything.

Bitcoins are officially the real deal.

Will do as soon as I get home from work

People seem to misunderstand what a dictionary is. Its just a catalog Of used words. Its not relevant to anything if a word is or is not in the dictionary. If you say it, and the correct meaning is conveyed, its a word.
