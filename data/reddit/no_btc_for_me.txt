Can you point me to where they have stated that "addresses do not represent the balance of your account"?
Prior to the last month, every trade I have made has reflected on that deposit address as well and I can verify that on blockchain.info 
And as far as what I can understand from 
is that the wallets are segregated by users. So deposit address is one part of your actual wallet and thus the deposit address BTCs can not be more than the actual BTCs you hold.
And if thats the case from where were the 2 BTCs coming during last few trades if the 1BTC was always present in the deposit address.
Just to clarify: This post is not regarding on how the reimbursements will proceed regardless of I have lost BTC or not

My current USD Equivalent Balance is less than what was prior to hack. Can someone explain if this is an issue? 
I just had BTC and USD in my accounts prior to hack with none used for margin trading/funding.
I had around 1.31 BTC and $9.8 before hack making my total USD Equivalent Balance = 1.31*604.10+9.8 = 801.171.
But now it shows total USD Equivalent Balance to be around 785 (0.8378BTC, $6.2701, 289.04BFX). The reason I say around 785 is because it is changing continuously between 785-788. So the $-BTC rate according to BFX now is (785 - 6.2701 - 289.04)/0.8378 = $584.49
So if trading is halted why is $-BTC rate not 604.10 on BFX but somewhere close to current rate? And why is it continuously changing?
On Another Note: Bitfinex home page still says, "We pride ourselves on being the most secure bitcoin exchange."

Since this obviously is a scam and this posts are coming regularly and I am not quite familiar with reddit, what can mods do to stop such posts?
