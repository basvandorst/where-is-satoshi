I posted this wondering if anyone else went through the same thing. I’m far too lazy to try and piece together intricate account details into a picture.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:32:12
Yes all that fiat currency will finally come in handy

Looks to me like a classic swimming lochness monster eating 50 chicken nuggets for $10 at McDonald’s

Bought at $700 hodling firm!
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:26:07
You’re doing it right broseph
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:05:45
Good thing it’s all profit ��

It’s lit! ����

I’m a little nervous to buy more at the top but screw it here we go

I don’t remember there ever not being at least a minor service outage on coinbase/gdax for the last few months

I see a steady swimming alligator mixed with an upside down flipped big bird pineapple formation.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:14:51
Yes I noticed some pretty hefty fees

Every once in a while it turns into a standing snuffalupagus 
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:25:29
Just hodl it ✅
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:22:37
I see a roaring lion �� 
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:58:41
I was down in 2014 and just put it out of my mind and hedl. It was a good decision then and looking into the future the only thing that makes sense is too continue hodling
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:28:19

It means hodl

Hey guy. 
First off, take a joke. 
2nd of all, I was mining bitcoin in 2014 so I’m just playing, I’ve already cashed out almost 10x.
3rd, I’ve never been one to watch chart formations that’s why I made that great alligator joke. Thanks friend

The left side needs to be sell/ also shut the fuck up
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:30:06
Mining can be very cruel. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except experts that know exactly what they're getting into. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:05:20
It is late for the early people and early for the late people

Better to spend silver than gold.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:58:58
I think I will, or at least recommend it to friends that want a way to get into bitcoin. I got burned so bad years ago I would have never looked at mining again. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:14:56
This made my day
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:04:08
Think of BTC as gold and ETH as silver. I would liken some of the other "decent" alts as other less precious metals. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:46:36
I wonder if it makes up for the Facebook idea that guy stole from them in college 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:39:28
They're salty!
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:37:48
It has been truly amazing. The best thing I ever did was stop thinking about it for 3 years

An easier way to memorize the words would be to make a song or rap from them and listen to it over and over. When I was in school it was the only way I could memorize Shakespeare.

This is so true, especially when it's new money and you're not being sensible about it. It's easy to buy a lot of stuff but most people don't think about the long term cost of all the stuff. The cost of living really adds up over years and having more stuff increases that cost exponentially. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:21:29
There is improved tech in other alt coins so i think it is definitely worth even a small side investment. I believe for the foreseeable future bitcoin will remain The Godfather of crypto currencies and the main store for larger amounts of wealth. Other cryptos will probably be used more in day to day spending because of the faster transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:05:59
I use and love both 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:36:25
And it gives you a stronger immune system afterwards
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:42:02
Yes. And the power + cooling issue. I haven't mined in years but back when I did it was difficult to keep the power in my house from periodically chipping out, plus keeping the room cool proved to be very difficult. After a couple rises in difficulty it wasn't worth it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:41:35
I was only here to buy BTC with BCH so with that I’ll be going now. See you next year!
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:34:37
Literally just did this. Do it and don't look back! Trezor or ledger nano s (I find the ledger easier to use).
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:16:24
That lawnmower must be made of 24 karat gold
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:17:55
Which one /btc?
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:18:17
Oh yes that's right
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:31:53
I believe Florida has no state income tax so that would soften the tax blow a little bit...
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:57:29
Vibranium actually sounds like a crypto currency, or a desktop wallet
