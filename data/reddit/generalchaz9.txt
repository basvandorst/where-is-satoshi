I have a graph pulled up right now for the last month, and every Sunday night through Monday morning it's dipped followed by a small spike the next day. 
Not sure why you have to be so abrasive, could just contribute some stats and tendencies of the stock or literally anything useful besides calling me a retard or telling me to kill myself. Not sure what you gain from that. Just trying to give a guy a bit of outlook of common trends before he pulls it all out.

The value of BTC always drops on a Monday, at least wait until later in the week lol

If you pay attention to BTC to USD prices, Sunday night through Monday mornings are *usually* the lowest points of the week.

I keep pondering taking the hit and cashing out ETH/LTC to go full BTC but ehhhhh

What do you mean? If you buy hardware that can mine around a dollar a day, you can get your profits back within half a year.

I've been thinking of buying new PC parts, and if this trend keeps up, I can finally upgrade using only crypto in the next month. Feelsgoodman

Usually takes a short time for alts to start rising after BTC. Honestly might pull out my ETH and LTC when they jump next so I can at least break even, then go straight BTC. Seems to be the most reliable and somewhat predictable coin.

Eh, not when I can mine the same amount back in a short amount of time with better hardware. I can put the cash I was going to use towards the PC during the next BTC dip. Its essentially just selling high, buying low, except I get PC parts out of it. 
I dont have that much in cryptos atm.

Why is that? Why are SMS Authentications bad?
