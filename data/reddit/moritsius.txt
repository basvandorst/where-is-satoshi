I have recently started using Luno because of the significant lower fees than Coinbase. It only features ETH and BTC but it seems for you that would be enough.

OTC doesn’t immediately impact the value in the exchanges, but can reduce the amount of coins available for trading. This could result in scarcety which might drive price up

This gives some ice food for thought

I actually went for Luno, which only deals with BTC and ETH but the fees are significantly less than Coinbase. Have been able to buy much more altcoins through that route. It taught me to not always choose the easiest big player route.

Buying monthly, average investment 5,2 k so down around 25%. No big deal, crypto is one of my four routes of funding early retirement.

1.  I bought share in a Scottish craft brewer (Brewdog) when the we’re a 5 Million company. Now they are valued above 1 billion.
2. I bought a flat in Budapest (Hungary) for renting out (passive income)
3. Old fashioned saving on top of normal pension contributions.

Hope so too but I am also still confident in Crypto :-)

Go for Tron, it’s use base is growing like hell and transaction speed is unmatched by Eth

I don’t think ETH will ever fully recover. It’s being taken over and will slowly die. BTC will rebound it is just a mental test for endurance now

Actually I live in Hungary :-)
