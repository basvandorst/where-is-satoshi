Couldn't this put you at potential risk to keyloggers though?

Yeah that's the worry of many people, the more specialized and exclusive mining becomes, the more centralized the entire 'control' of the blockchain becomes as well.
But still, for miners to effectively abuse the chain to gain any money they would need a 50%+ share of the mining power and time it right with whatever tactic they use to cheat everyone, doublespend or whatever. Which would be extremely unlikely, difficult and risky.
Even less likely would be to alter already existing transactions in nodes.  Almost everyone would have to be on board. Bitcoin would have to fork and likely the whole system would crumble if the nodes across the network were all compromised... 
Maybe there should be (or is) a contingency plan for everyone to roll back a certain amount of blocks if an attack occurs. But the damage towards trusting the system would be done.

Bitcoin Yahoo parallel confirmed. So which coin is Google?

PSA on 2FA: Don't use SMS, use an authenticator app like Google authenticator. SMS's are easily intercepted and altered.

Any tips on getting wised up on Iota or is the subreddit a good enough place to begin?

Noob here but I imagine if you order 1 BTC at the limit and someone happens to be selling 0.5 BTC at that price at the time that portion will be considered the 'taker' part.

Electrum should be good enough on it's own. Just make sure to transfer to your electrum public address from whatever exchange. 
If you have enough money in there a hardware wallet isn't a bad idea... You've been scammed once before.

Electrum encrypts your address and I think has two stage authentication, email or mobile for instance so it's relatively secure.
