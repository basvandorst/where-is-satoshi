Tail risk investing.  Kyle Bass has made billions for his hedge fund doing that.  (Probably lots of hedge funds.  I'm just familiar with him) During the housing bubble most of his investments were in a normal risk and a small amount in tail risk, still made billions.

I used to listen to him a lot back in like 08-09.  Smart guy.  I think he has mild aspergers or something.  He misses lots of subtleties when talking to people.  If you ever listen to him it's strikingly obvious he would be incapable of scheming people.  He's a true believer.  I've moved way past his ideas since then.  He's still ahead of 99% of the population, though, in understanding that there's going to be a major reshuffling of the global order the scale of the period of the great depression, WWI, and WWII.  
I would recommend [Eric Janszen]( and [Chris Martenson]( for more advanced economics that integrate global social order.  
Good Eric Janszen article on the role of [oil, the dollar, and gold](  Scroll down to *The U.S. dollar as “good as gold for oil” or not*.  There must be a stable reserve currency to trade for oil.  It will likely be gold for a period of time again.

*Most well* or most *efficiently*?  I don't know much about modern Germany governance except that they're in the news a lot more...they learned the lesson of self promotion finally.  I do know that they are one of the most energy dependent countries in Europe, and Merkel said the solar program is a complete failure.  In the end I suspect Germany will have to cow to Russia for energy. 
I'm been reading a lot about WWI...Best run, largest, and most efficient military in the world, but when plans hit reality much was missing.  They had a plan of attack that had to fall perfectly into place, weak allies and diplomacy skills, lacked resources, terrible at propaganda. 
And then WWII almost the same story.  Efficiency was chosen over whole systems thinking.  I'm curious if the country has really taken that lesson completely yet.  I think we'll find out when the next crisis hits in the next 5 or so years.

Bitcoin spent 5 months under the 200 dma late 2011.  I don't think it'll stay that long under it, but a couple months isn't out of the question.  
2010-2011 bitcoin rose for 3/4 year, consolidated for 1 3/4 yr.  2013 rose 3/4 yr (from previous high), consolidates for only a year?  A year consolidation based off the smaller rise in 2013 than 2010-11 and that bull markets accelerate.

No, all markets in the US, and many globally, key off of the Federal reserves rate.  See [ZIRP]( as a starting point.  The low savings account interest rate, as an example, is a direct result of the FED rate.  Low mortgage rates are doubly controlled by the FED as they bought massive amounts of mortgage backed securities. 


So what?  It's a zero sum game.  The person who buys it experiences a loss while the seller experiences a gain.  It is becoming increasingly clear that the next generation of young adults can not afford houses.
The problem is that the manipulation of the market caused houses to be massively overbuilt, particularly in expensive to maintain places like the wasteland of Arizona, Nevada, and Florida

TL:skimmed ...Expert in complex systems here.  I have a good understanding of mathematics and economics but they are really only useful in firming up the details when it comes to the long term bitcoin picture. 
The reason the US moved to financialization is connected to EROEI.  The FIRE economy was the least energy intensive path to follow.  To form a smooth transition to to renewable energy the US, and globe, had to start the process 25 to 30 years ago.  These are the hurdles I see for Bitcoin long term:
-Electricity costs are going to be going up substantially in the next 5 years.  The fracking bubble is already cracking.
-The second, larger, half of the the global depression is yet to come.  In times of stress people fall back on old systems... think a gold standard
-The internet likely will not survive in this form over the next decade.  Resource wars and increased government control is coming.  Hopefully WWIII isn't.
-Bitcoin may be superior to a centralized E-currency but that doesn't mean it won't be crushed by one, say an Apple or Google currency.  I was amazed how many people here on r/bitcoin used i-phones.  Why?  I assume they used them for ascetics and status over function.

Risk management!!...Leave about 10% in bitcoin ($5k).  Bitcoin has a decent chance of being at $4k to $10k in several years.  If this happens you've double or tripled your total funds. ($55k -&gt; $100k to $150k)  If you're wrong $5k will make your situation negligibly worse. ($55k -&gt; $50k).  Meanwhile get a part time job or cut back your expenses putting money in a much safer investment.  That way if you're wrong you can show your family that you've been trying to make it up to them.  Put say $20k away from your own earnings before saying anything.
  Nassim Taleb is an author that many here like that talks about the philosophy of risk management.  Like others have said you clearly haven't admitted you're a gambler.  It's also interesting that your family would trust you with that much money.
I, personally, would do 12% and break it into a few different areas to diversify my risk, but I don't think you have the knowledge to do that.  Gold I have more confidence in than bitcoins.  I think it will hit $5k to $10k in five years and silver maybe $250...personally I would do maybe $4k btc, $2k gold, $2k silver...but I've studied monetary systems for years.

That's just basic speculation.  Everything that goes up rapidly is not a bubble.  I traded currencies and commodities for many years.  The only people I've heard throw around the world bubble like you do is everyone on this subreddit and people I know irl who have no clue about investing.


1. An economic cycle characterized by rapid expansion followed by a **contraction.**
2. A surge in equity prices, often more than warranted by the fundamentals and usually in a particular sector, followed by a **drastic drop** in prices as a massive selloff occurs.
3. A theory that security prices rise above their true value and will continue to do so until prices go into **freefall** and the **bubble bursts.** 
Without the big drop it is not a bubble.

At this moment technology has shown zero ability to outpace the falling quality of fossil fuels.

I only see you characterizing it as a single big event.  The US is losing its dominance over the Middle East and Eastern Europe at this very moment.  Obviously the end of the global hegemonic power takes time.  The British empire declined while still being on top for decades.  The US peaked around 1971 when US oil EROEI peaked, Nixon closed the gold window, and then the US lost the Vietnam war.  This peak was obscured by many things: 2 parents going to work, debt, Alaska and North Sea oil, tech boom, ongoing housing bubble.
Japan will go first...within 5 years likely.  Their living standards will drop precipitously.  Something like Argentina after 2001 or Russia after the Soviet collapse. How it effects someone in the US depends on how close they are to the money centers.  Detroit is already on its way to being 3rd world.

You must understand that looking at the world through the lens of free will is somewhat arbitrary, when you say a lot more work must be done.  It's equally valid to look at the world systemically, with each event being the result of all prior events.
I could say it's 95% probable that the world monetary system will change in the next 10 years, and *inevitable* ( a rounding off of 99.9%) that it will change in the next 20 years.  I also think it's inevitable that gold will be relinked to fiat.  I know that I have a better monetary understanding than 99.99% of people and a better systems understanding than 99.999% of people.  But I can't explain this lifetime of knowledge to you, or take the time to prove it.  I think Nassim Taleb covers this topic in the Black Swan.  
Anyways, what is or is not, essentially, inevitable is based on your systems understanding.  Americans are horrific at systems understanding.

We haven't even tested the previous high yet.  Look at the long term log chart.  Now look at the charts of all the bull markets of the last 100 years.  Pretty standard stuff happening.  A couple stairs up.  Then a big correction and consolidation.
October 2010 to July 2011: 400 to 500 times move.  Year and a half consolidation
Janurary 2013 to April 2013: 25 to 30 times move.  5 month consolidation  
My best guess is we'll see another move equal to Jan-April 2013 and then a really big correction based on the two (Jan-April 2013 + Now) together.   So we could go to like $2500 and correct all the way back to $400.
My next scenarios would be we retest the high and consolidate for a while longer.  Or we get stuck at around $1000.

Human emotions of greed and fear, the flow of information (although accelerated now), attempts to exploit and scam a growing market, authorities response, etc. stay substantially the same.  Hence why bull markets look very similiar.  Gold has the most similiar attributes.  Welcome to the world of trying to predict complex systems

I listened to Max long before I came to this pocket of great intellectualism./s   This is what he has been pushing consistently for years:  government/corporate paper ponzi will collapse reeking disaster on the lower classes, American militarism is about power consolidation, gold and silver will rise,  bitcoins will rise, the increasing ecology disaster ignored by modern economic shamanism will be huge.  He talks about revolting, which may seem absurd now, but many will wish they had when they didn't haven't to worry about basic survival necessities.   
These are the issues he's been talking about over and over again.  Not some 5 minute clip on quark coins.  I'm not sure where he's on the wrong side of any of these issues.  In a couple years bitcoins will be accepted or not.  All the other issues will still be important, highly likely more important than bitcoins.  99% of r/bitcoin will still be oblivious to them all.

You missed my point entirely.   The OP is not a trader.  His charts are completely absurd.  Whether your charts are a better model or mine his still are useless.  We both chose reasonable time frames.  He purposely cut the chart.

This move was pittance compared to Oct 2010 to June 2011.  It wasn't unreasonable to think it could have gone higher.  Not that I bought up there.

There are several ways to look at it but for me I'd have to see a move to $50 to see similarities to 2011.

And pretty much every bull market.  They always move in parabolic moves and consolidation periods, not steady rises.

I'm holding.  Contemplating buy orders between $25 and $60  
I don't understand all these low targets and year long consolidation calls.  This crash has been pittance compared 2011.  Wake me if significantly breaks and holds below $30.  Otherwise this is normal bull market behavior

I call B.S.  - [long term chart] (  (Sorry not up to date).  No trader takes a small snapshot like that.  You look at the long term chart.  I am a trader (Not bitcoins).  Until I see the pattern of higher highs and lower lows broken I'm not even interested.  I'd really have to see the April 2011 low taken out to throw in the towel.
Edit:  Also bull market bubbles don't pop after a tiny move like this, after a long consolidation.  I'd have to see a move at least double the move in 2010-11

If you bothered to look at a bull market chart, made a plan, stuck with it, didn't invest more than you could lose... you're like zzz, let's just get to the finish line so I can move on to something else.

Yes, Max Keiser uses too much hyperbole.  But I'd take his opinion over 99% of r/bitcoin users any day.  When you're ahead of the curve you have to talk and think in generalities.  
Max figured out bitcoins several years ago.  Think about that, considering he's a news commentator at this point in his life.  He doesn't work directly in technology like the vast majority of the adopters back then.  Without ever understanding the specifics he had enough confidence to push it on his show, only second to gold and silver.  He has something called systems intelligence, being able to grasp the likely outcome of a complex system that is too complex to parse to get an answer. Most of Reddit lacks this.  That why he is hated.  Most redditors needs all the details spelled out to them in order to understand a concept. 
Max is about ten years ahead on the link between economics and the environment.  Max figured out that human environmental degradation is not calculated in things like GDP.  That for every $1 of production humans are destroying say $0.80 of the natural systems that they need to survive.  Only a few I know have figured that out like John Michael Greer and Dimtry Orlov
People think he pumped and dumped silver.  He still believes in silver.  If you understand the economic disaster coming it's hard not to.  He still posts articles on gold/silver.  But there's only so much to say when there's no news on it.
Anyways, to the bitcoin specialists here Max seems like an idiot.  In a few years bitcoin will either be a part of society or not.  All those 1000s of hours the bitcoin specialist spent learning and discussing bitcoin will be useless either way.  A new trend will begin.  The person with systems intelligence will have spent say only 1% of the hours on bitcoin but with 90% of the benefits that the specialist got.

And a TECHNOLOGY.  Why is it necessary for people to put things into neat little categories?  You are buying into a slice of a more efficient monetary exchange method...


Your argument works equally well for dollar bills.  Hence the Yen pricing ( vs the dollar pricing (  ~~Dollars theoretically can work at any price.~~  Yes true, but it's a meaningless statement.  That's a theoretical reality that is unlikely to exist.   If every user holds, 'saves', just one coin on average in their wallet as a funding source and there are 50 million users the low ball numbers are absurd.  It all comes down to the TECHNOLOGY.
Will it work?  Personally, I think the chances are low in the long run.  But I think the porential reward outweighs the risk, and it's worth a small INVESTMENT.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:43:35
Gold has been around many thousands of years as a currency, the dollar several hundred (sort of), and bitcoins several years.  Today's speed-of-information is violently compressing the bitcoin 'testing' into a few years
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:27:26


There are three categories, not two: 1)usage 2) speculation on the viability of a technology or business.  (Akin to buying google at its IPO.) 3) speculation on purely rising prices (Akin to buying a house looking to flip it because prices always go up.)
Oddly you touch on all three and define them well, yet you blur the very clear line between speculative investing and bubble investing.  This was clearly part of OP's point, although maybe he used erroneous means to illustrate it.  People don't understand the difference between speculative investment and a bubble.  A failed speculation does not make it a bubble crashing.  Gold in the 70s was a legitimate speculation on the demise of US dollar hegemony.  It only became a bubble at the very end.   
  
I haven't looked at any data but I would think it's something like 20% price rise from usage, 75% price rise from people investing who believe bitcoin's price is too low for their potential, and 5% looking to catch the wave up and cash out before it crashes.

Not just the Chinese.  Each parabolic move brings in an order of magnitude more people.  Those people are where you were when you first learned about bitcoins. 
This is how all bull markets work.  A couple stair steps up(vertical moves followed by small consolidations), then a massive correction and a long consolidation.  Repeat.  Just the flow of information and trust.    
@_date: 2013-03-19 17:13:49
Just like the 70-80s gold bubble wasn't really a bubble.  It was a bet against continued US dollar hegemony.  Obviously the gold investors lost their bet.  At the time there were legitimate reasons to think that was a good bet to take though.

If the main userbase of bitcoins income is severely diminished they will be forced to liquidate.  The question is how high will bitcoins be at that point. I don't see another 2008 coming for like 3-5 more years; the central bank are in 'control' for now.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:41:39
Yes,  obviously I know that.   My comparison is still better than the comparison in this thread.  This a minor amateur exchange.  You're going to compare the closing of the 200 year old largest (?) in the world exchange to the closing of MtGox.  Hitting of a circuit breaker is more reasonable in scope.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:55:16
Technical analysis is an attempt to measure mass psychology of market participants such as the general public, commercial traders, and retail traders.  It's similar to a poker game.  One is trying to read common patterns and front run those patterns.  Obviously markets are orders of magnitude more complex than a poker game, hence why it looks like astrology to the 'sucker' at the table.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:56:36
And if it majorly corrects from here then the move up was smaller than April 2011 and January 2013.  So therefore...the correction will be smaller. Everybody panic!!!

I don't follow it too closely but I think it's becoming more and more mainstream knowledge that gold and silver are being lent out to multiple parties at the same time.  Considering the small amount of data to go on, I suspect in the end the 'conspiracy theorists'  will have a high enough hit to miss ratio that they were worth listening to, particularly with the high risks involved.  We won't find out until the tide goes out, i.e. the inevitable monetary crisis, who wasn't wearing pants.
I mean, even Alex Jones if you can find filter out the 30% quality information he's like 10 years above the curve.  Very useful.  I'd put Max Keiser more like 60%

But but, bitcoins' standard unit outpriced golds' for a brief period of time therefore gold stackers are fools.  I'm curious to see how bitcoins handle the real deflationary event, some g-20 hyperinflations, and maybe even a global resource war.

It's a speculation on a 'technology', not a bubble!  US M2 money supply is 10.4 Trillion.  Bitcoin market value is 1.4 Billion.  If bitcoin's intrinsic value stand up it will be worth orders of magnitude more than it is today in a short period of years.  The rate of the move is not out of line with its potential.

Show me - [Nasdaq vs. Bitcoin] (  Bitcoins - A large move up, a reasonable correction compared to the run-up, a year long consolidation, and a minor break to new highs.  That describes pretty much every part of the Nasdaq chart before the final bubble phase; every part of the Nasdaq chart that if you had bought you would have likely gained even after the crash.  Pull up the other 4 recent bull markets ( Gold x 2, Oil, DJIA) and you'll see the same thing 
I don't know if bitcoins will follow other bull markets, but this guy clearly has no idea what he is talking about

Mined my coins 2 years ago.  Those are my hold coins.  
I have buy orders in from $35 to $75 even though that'll raise my average cost significantly.  Those are going to be my trade coins if I get any.  Maybe I'll raise the price a bit.  I had no intention of trading bitcoins.  I trade commodities, and after reading this subreddit these past couple days it's hard to resist trading.  This place is total amateur hour.
