Corrupt government shills and their banking cronies are creating bogus bitcoin Apple apps, to discredit the crypto space. 
Normally these type of false flag operations have been limited to terror attacks on their own citizens or the fake war on drugs, maybe bitcoin is ascending faster than many have reported.

**Bitcoin** = **Digital Gold**
In the future Bitcoin will have such value, that you will be lucky to even own **1**. The individual 100,000,000 million satoshi of each Bitcoin will be the units that will be utilised for transfer.
Of course by then each satoshi might share parity with the value of 1 Dollar, and any remaing legacy banks will be looked upon as telephone kiosks in the street, welcome to the future.

Nope! I thought the following was also coincidental..
**"The company was one of the first to launch ETC trading soon after the hard fork of Ethereum last week, followed by ETCBTC and ETCUSD margin trading the next day."**
Lest we forget, the fiat banks are on the verge of collapse, and we know how much those bastards love Bitcoin.

This OP is similar to **Swiss Cheese**, full of holes.
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:29:23
**Firstly**, why does tyranny AKA as regulation prevail? fear, fear, and more fear. The psychopaths and criminals that are not part of society but wish to rule society, have always utilised divide and conquer.       
**Secondly**, it's very simple, some people are subservient, and will always be enslaved, they believe they cannot take a shit without obtaining permission from the nanny state. However, they would prefer to see you enslaved as well, than live as a free human being.
**Thirdly**, Bitcoin is just an electronic decentralised form of barter, that ironically removes the *"can I take a shit now master?"* but the sheeple have been programmed so well to request permission, that they seek the same shackles that bind them.
**Fourthly**, the whores, shills, and enforcers of the above cabal are many, soulless entities that deal in misery and pain to keep the status quo, not just for financial gain, but for the gratification they receive from the pain of others.

Bitcoin will attain and go beyond the price of 1 Bar of Gold which currently sits above $500,000.
Each Bitcoin contains 100 million units called Satoshi's which will achieve parity with 1 USA Dollar in the future.

Multiple choice answer,
1. Because, I'm just a closet troll and fudder.
2. Because I'm in awe of Roger Ver *"Man Crush"*, and will post anything, that my paid remit instructs me to.
3. I'm just part of the Herd, and have no idea what I'm talking about. Plus the 
   155 million  **Newmoaning Token** that I just purchased for 10 dollars, requires a pump. 
4. My new 2 day reddit account' is just one of 50 that I registered to FUD. 
5. I'm shorting Bitcoin Futures, and it appears that I might get REKT, so me and the pony tail 
    wearing wannabe traders in the cheap suits, think fudding &amp; trolling will stop the Honey Badger. 
6. All the above.

I'm positive your **£10 pounds** will be safe on an Electrum wallet,  if you still feel insecure with that method, still keep that £10 pound in your piggy bank so you can at least get some sleep.

**Firstly**, I've never heard of Bitquick
**Secondly**, I think you need to digest the fact that you **fucked up!**, and in light of that you need to take a chill pill, before ranting all over reddit with your **"0 hour account"**
**Thirdly**, if you have made any mistake with any form of wire transfer or money fiat transaction that involves your bank, irrespective of Bitcoin, there will be some form of delay whilst they check into the details.
**Fourthly,** all the above appears dubious to me, but hey! I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
**Fifthly**, when all the above gets resolved, which might be Monday, after the foot dragging weekend by the banks. 
Please come back and post a huge sensationalist **HEADLINE OP** about your **"Premature

1 100 Million $atoshi units make 1 Bitcoin.
In the future when 1 Satoshi achieves parity with $1 Dollar, you'll very rarely see a whole Bitcoin transaction, just smaller Satoshi transactions.
If you own or HOLD 1 Bitcoin now, you're extremely fortunate.
Historic days, anyone who obtains Bitcoin below $5000 dollars, could be considered an early adopter.

I normally don't give a shit, if an alleged trader gets he's arsed served to him playing Gordon Gekko at an exchange. To be honest your [SENSATIONLIST HEADLINE](  caught my eye. After all that effort that you went to, I thought would take a peek, and give a short insight. 
Well! **firstly**, I **noted** the account history age,  and posting date in respect of [UnknownRighter]( 
So at first blush, it would appear you are new, but a further glance you appear to be a silent lurker shall we say.
About a year ago a reddit user u/NakoshiSatamoto warned about Kraken, and problems [therein]( 
I have no affiliation with Kraken or any exchange, but as long time lurker you should be aware about the mantra of coins and exchanges. 
In fact Karma is a bitch, especially Kraken Karma it would appear.
So the best I can do in terms of empathy, is refer you to your sympathetic [answer]( you gave u/SakoshiNatamoto in respect of his woes with Kraken, a year ago.

So you have **Bitcoin** aka **Digital Gold** as the unbreakable, secure base, and then you can create basically a side chain, to create 1MBcoin or 2MBcoin, even 25MBcoin each denoted by different colors. 
I believe Dogecoin did something like this, where they burned Dogecoin to create Dogeparty, a spin of, of Counterparty, not sure what happened to that idea.
**However,** Dogecoin is an *"inflationary"* coin, whilst Bitcoin is a *"deflationary"* coin. I prefer to time-lock than burn, although burning a Bitcoin *"if possible"* would appear to reduce the amount of available coin, therefore   increasing the price of remaining Bitcoin.

The problem is, that he allegedly owned between 400,000 - 450,000 BTC back in the day. 
You can do a lot of damage with that amount, evidenced by history, it's crystal clear to see the fruits of his labour. 
If fact you could invest in exchanges, employ 3 marketing agencies, to create an imaginary community of sock puppet shilling and trolling accounts. Their sole purpose to hijack and control the narrative, spread FUD, and misinformation. 
You could even create many alt coins with no usage , but pump many thousands of BTC into them and, then crash and burn their price, and still come out on top.

The Bitcoin community, was warned this was about to happen by a top cryptographic expert [Amanda B Johnson](
Although some believe she's a **shrill** for the alt coin Dash, however, we can quite clearly see she was allegedly warning the community that **"Bitcoin had been infiltrated"** by nefarious actors and entities. "In effect she was alledgedly **"Whistle Blowing"** about **"Bitcoin Unlimited"** and **Roger Ver**.
I would like to offer Amanda our gratitude, for her due diligence and sterling detective work, in unmasking those responsible, and shedding light on this dastardly plot.
How deep does this Rabbit Hole go? one can only speculate, It appears that eyebrows are being raised, at the sudden rise in the price of Dash and ETH allegedly connected to Roger Ver.

r/Bitcoin has been infested with an army of trolls using multiple fake accounts paid by Roger Ver to split Bitcoin for his latest scam.
We have seen this shit too many times, don't fall for his latest scam in support of his alt coins and many scam businesses.
**HODL!**   
@_date: 2016-06-27 09:51:36
One would think that the simplest thing for the lay-person to do is **HODL**, for the market price to rise.
Alas, it's crystal clear like all markets, that the corrupt establishment have their sticky finger prints on, will behave to suit hidden agenda's, albeit on a smaller scale with Bitcoin.
Subsequently any coins that are under control of these arseholes, will be utilised to suppress or have a negative effect on the Bitcoin price or perceived value.
Although such skulduggery and manipulation will require a huge reserve of fiat to sustain, remember they have the keys to the printing presses.
In the **short term**, the price will appear to move sideways with small fluctuations within the $200 range, these small rises and dips are in consequence to parasites AKA wannabe traders ;D), who have no interest in the ethos of Bitcoin or crypto in general, but see an opportunity to make a quick buck.
**However!**, on the bright side, the coins held by this cabal are limited, so if Joe Public just **HODL** in the medium and long term, the price will react to the scarcity.
**Post Brexit** expect the price to dip more than usual against an advertised expected rise, this alleged mini dump, followed by ramped up doom and gloom fear mongering by shills and trolls of the banking establishment, will be effected to shake out all the weak hands, generally referred to as noobs, to obtain their Bitcoin for a bargain rate.

These lying bastards, own all the so called polls and media outlets, of course they've been pushing the lie that it's 56% stay  44% leave, just fucking lies. 
All the fiat money they have stolen from the public, and squirreled away in off shore tax havens, rich thieving bastards. 
At present leave votes are being suppressed, but even skulduggery cannot stop the flood of people who want to escape the corruption. 
**Brexit** will be the first domino to fall, then Greece, **Grexit** followed by Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, the EU and it's monopoly money the Euro, is fucked.
Wake up people you have been lied to, over and over again by these warmongering corrupt bureaucrats.  
The drop in the price of Bitcoin and fake rise in the price of the Pound earlier today, was manipulated by theses evil fuckers by their bankster mates, just to give the impression that everyone wants to stay in the broken ponzi scheme called the Euro Zone. 
The Pound is now falling they can't hide whats going to happen, whatever you do never sell or let go of your Bitcoin, **HODL** it like your life depended upon it. 
These are historic days, a new era of awareness, the sheeple are slowly waking UP!

If Bitcoin ascends to it's moon value of say 10 Million dollars per coin for example, you can erase all that debt, with some change left over.

Sovereign nations financial markets are imploding, the dyke has been breached.

The Roman Games AKA the Olympics,and Euro Football, have lost their sparkle and distraction value, the natives are getting restless. 
Financial markets mean nothing in the real world to average Joe public, it's lack of food or fuel that grabs their attention.

You're probably aware of the plethora of alt coins as I am, but I've always been curious about them, generally upon research I find pre-mine scams and what not. 
However, to be fair some have different tech or an ethos that might be useful, the crypto tech is mostly above my pay grade.
Only thing I've learned observing the cyrpto space for a few years as a layperson, is that Bitcoin is **Digital Gold** and in ascendance. 
I still think it requires an additional gateway into the real world apart from fiat.

In politics 24 hours is a long time, maybe a few more refugee/terror suspect boats get washed ashore. Lets see what Boris and the rest of his mob can create to ramp up the jingoistic media, they can't help themselves, that's why **Brexit** has never been off the menu.

There are 1.4 Trillion Dollars in circulation at the moment, and there will be 21 Million Bitcoin.
Each Bitcoin is divisible to 8 Decimal places
 ( 1.00000000), each of these units are called a **"Satoshi"** there are 100,000,000 million Satoshi in 1 Bitcoin.
21 Million Bitcoin x 100,000,000 Satoshi's = **2.1 quadrillion units.**
Maybe the **MOON!** is **1 Satoshi** having parity of value to **1 Dollar.**

If I had a time machine, I could explain in very simple terms **"Parity"**.
Each Bitcoin consists of 100,000,000 million units called Satoshi's.
When the SHTF in the banking system including the financial markets, *"which it has already"*, the dollar and the rest of fiat will go the same way as the Zimbabwean Dollar.
However, the corrupt elite already know this, but there not letting the sheeple know, just keep feeding them BS and "X Factor".
Value has to hide somewhere and Precious Metals ( PM ) are so last year, what is required is **Digital Gold** aka **Bitcoin**.
**TLDR:** There's an Iceberg ahead, and those of you in steerage are not being told that fact, by the powers that be, Bitcoin is the Life Boat, but hey! who gives a shit! dancing with the stars is on TV.

Hindsight is a wonderful thing, you could sell now and make over $500 profit and be happy, but if the price rose to $900 a coin around the halvening you have just missed out on a further $400 profit on top of the $500 original profit. It also depends upon on what you're trying to achieve, short term profit or long term profit, only invest what you can afford to lose.
You can also apply the **Morpheus** rule, what future value **do you believe** and attribute to Bitcoin? *research*
I personally **believe** that in the future, each **Satoshi unit** will achieve parity with **1 US Dollar** and there are 100,000,000 million Satoshi's in each Bitcoin. 
The world economy is fucked! but Bitcoin can be utilised to soak up all that debt with some change left over, when it becomes impossible for the corrupt politicians and bankster's to stop this epiphany.
In light of my above belief I will never under-sell my Bitcoin, and have my own benchmark **"fuck you price"**, time willing.

**Brexit!** is back on the menu, the corrupt establishment and elite with their BS propaganda media, are getting exposed, pumping BS out 24/7.
These lying bastards, own all the so called polls and media outlets, of course they've been pushing the lie that it's 56% stay 44% leave, just fucking lies.
All that fiat money they have stolen from the public, and squirreled away in off shore tax havens, to hide the spoils for the rich, thieving bastards.
At present leave votes are being suppressed, but even skulduggery cannot stop the flood of people who want to escape the corruption.
**Brexit** will be the first domino to fall, then Greece, **Grexit** followed by Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, the EU and it's monopoly money the Euro, is fucked. The dollar will be next as China turn up the heat, Japan and the Yen will follow the Pound in the free fall. 
Wake up people you have been lied to, over and over again by these warmongering corrupt bureaucrats.
The drop in the price of Bitcoin and fake rise in the price of the Pound earlier today, was manipulated by theses evil fuckers by their bankster mates, just to give the impression that everyone wants to stay in the broken ponzi scheme called the Euro Zone.
The Pound is now falling they can't hide whats going to happen, whatever you do never sell or let go of your Bitcoin, **HODL** it like your life depended upon it.
The perfect safe haven of choice will be Bitcoin, buy some popcorn and watch the fiat markets implode.

The reason I ask if you owned any, was to try and gauge what you're are trying to achieve.
If you purchased Bitcoin @ $500 for example, and wish to sell now to lock in your ROI and profit now because your worried that the price might diminish, you're trading short term.
If you purchased Bitcoin @ $1000 for example, and wish to sell now at a loss, because your worried that the price might diminish, you're trading short term at a loss.
Either example in my opinion are wrong, however, many wannabe traders might prefer the first example.
I don't trade, I buy and HODL long term, I'm not interested in $200 - $500 short term profit.

By the way numb nuts, out of every Dollar or Pound including the Euro only 1% of collected taxes, goes to infrastructure, that's right 1 Cent of every dollar or 1 penny of every pound goes to hospital, roads, or education.

The above ignorance is terrifying, not sure if you're concern trolling or just BAA BAA.  
According to your synopsis, which you appear to have found in the encyclopedia for **"Sheeple"**, the USA Dollar , Euro, and British Pound are backed by Gold? 
For example a English Ten pound note states on it's face *"I promise to pay  the bearer on demand the sum of Ten Pounds"* of what? Goat Shit.
Bitcoin is "**Digital Gold"** and therefore requires no backing just like Gold, and before you start bleating about intrinsic value, value is subjective to requirement.

As predicted **Brexit** has been confirmed against all the odds, of the corrupt establishment rigged polls and bent media manipulated propaganda.
This moment is historic, and the first seismic domino falling in a corrupt rigged EU ponzi scheme.
Greece and Spain will follow with their Grexit &amp; Sprexit, then Portugal, Italy and the rest. The EU is finished, more importantly the EURO will be exposed as the monopoly money that it always was. The dollar and Yuan will be in conflict with further implosion that will make 2008 so called crash look like a dip.
As for Bitcoin, it will be the safe haven of choice, from the perfect storm and carnage from the fiat and assets markets.

One would think that the simplest thing for the lay-person to do is **HODL**, for the market price to rise.
 Alas, it's crystal clear like all markets, that the corrupt establishment have their sticky finger prints on, will behave to suit hidden agenda's, albeit on a smaller scale with Bitcoin. 
Subsequently any coins that are under control of these arseholes, will be utilised to suppress or have a negative effect on the Bitcoin price or perceived value. 
Although such skulduggery and manipulation will require
a huge reserve of fiat to sustain, remember they have the keys to the printing presses.
In the **short term**, the price will appear to move sideways with small fluctuations within the $200 range, these small rises and dips are in consequence to **parasites AKA traders** ;D), who have no interest in the ethos of Bitcoin or crypto in general, but see an opportunity to make a quick buck. 
**However!**, on the bright side, the coins held by this cabal are limited, so if Joe Public just **HODL** in the **medium and long term**, the price will react to the scarcity.
Post Brexit, expect the price to dip more than usual against an advertised expectation rise, this alleged mini dump followed by ramped up doom and gloom fear mongering by shills and trolls of the banking  establishment, will be effected to shake out all the weak hands, generally referred to as **noobs**, to obtain their Bitcoin for a bargain rate.
**Hold! &amp; Popcorn** is solution of the day.

Humans fuck as a species literally, and figuratively, that's why Bitcoin is being attacked at it's weakest point, us fuckers.
You cannot be surprised that "Divide and Conquer" has been set forth and implemented into the Bitcoin crypto-space.
The profits from world enslavement and financial tryanny are vast for the selected few, history is littered with evidenced of the barbarity of these bastards, death and destruction of the innocent, pillage and rape are just further niches for profit. Do you think they will just slip into the night quietly? hell no! remember they have unlimited fiat to bribe and coerce like they have always done, in an attempt to defeat freedom.  
This so called titanic struggle between segwit, fuckwit, bigblock, smallcock,  it's all manufactured bollocks!... bottom line you either want Bitcoin to work or you don't.
To all the advocates and shills of the fiat legacy brigade involved with, Digital Currency Group, R3 and BLOCKCHAIN consortium.. go and fuck yourselves with sugar on top!

1 Bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 million units, each unit is called a Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:14:31
Bitcoin was designed to be the following .....
a-peer-to-peer version of electronic cash
a-peer-to-peer network
**Subsequent Benefits**
Store of Value = "Digital Gold"
1 Bitcoin divisible to 8 decimal places 0.00000000 each unit is 1 Bit/Satoshi. each unit use/case could also be classed as "Digital Copper"
Micro Transactions
Programmable 
**Future Development** 
Smart Contracts
Lightning network  
The above, just a small example of the possible known
uses, just think of those case uses that have yet to be created and developed .

The sheeple epiphany, the realisation that Bitcoin = Freedom, that realization that there are 100,000,000 million bits per Bitcoin, and that each bit will reach parity with $1 USA. 
The above realisation by the 99% will be the tipping point, and all the fiat in the world will pour into Bitcoin like a giant sink hole, it will be epic, that's what the powers that be fear, where's my popcorn?.

To reprogram oneself or wake up, after years of indoctrination, is a simple matter of **yes** or **no**. The difficulty lies in self belief in oneself, against the noise of fear of the unknown, and ridicule induced by others. These can be referred to as baby steps.
Bitcoin is at an impasse, on its face a self inflicted one. 
However,  I believe there is a solution to this conundrum no matter how entrenched positions may appear. How we get through this maze, has got the old grey matter working on overtime :p, a cocktail of frustration and suspicion.

**Fantastic! article**
**Firstly**, don't be disheartened by  the tepid response from the brainwashed sheeple. They are so asleep, that they fail to realise, that they are **turkeys** voting for **thanksgiving**.
**Secondly**, I won't go into the history of **"Demockery"** I will just allude to the solution, which is surprisingly simple.
How? you may ponder.
All the great unwashed have to do, is to dump fiat, any fiat or currency into Bitcoin, it's that simple.
**Tax!** is the root of enslavement, **fiat** is the weapon of choice utilised by your masters.
**Bitcoin** is made up from **100,000,000 million** units called a **Satoshi** or **Bit's**. Instead of buying a beer or a pizza,  buy some Satoshi or bit's.
Value is subjective, **1 Bit** or **Satoshi** will achieve parity of **$1 Dollar**, it's simple do the maths. Of course people and naysayers will say ridiculous, I can hear the **bleating** already ;D) 
**However**, the question is, *"do you want freedom from this corrupt warmongering tryanny?"* if the answer is **yes**!, well maybe it's worth the price of a **beverage**.

Andreas had an online session of learning Bitcoin for University of Nicosia, that is very interesting:  on Bitcoin.) 
After digesting a fraction of this info, (MNG) suddenly has an epiphany, that Bitcoin is divisible by 8 decimal places and each Bitcoin is made of 100,000,000 million units called Bits/Satoshi.
In fact (MNG) has just realised that he has just purchased over 13,600,000 million Bits/Satoshi with his original $100.
Knowing that the fiat markets and corrupt banking institutions are imploding, it doesn't take long for him to also realise that each bit/Satoshi will reach parity and surpass the USA Dollar.
Armed with this fact (MNG) buys another $900 of Bitcoin with his soon to be worthless fiat.
And lives happily ever after. ;D)

The notion is simple! but the concept and idea is difficult.
To clarify if someone could create **"anti gravity boots"** "for example" that you could **only purchase with Bitcoin** then your problem would be solved.  
However, competing and overcoming modern day distraction trinkets, like iphones and laptops, is quite a high hurdle.
Tyranny! and enslavement requires **TAX** which requires **FIAT**, to solve that conundrum is quite simple in non compliance, yet difficult in practice.
If Bitcoin is the perceived poster child of Freedom, well that's a good start.

It's crystal clear that you have understood, but not **overstood** my question. I get the passion angle, I also have a penchant for being polemical about certain issues, however...

might have fixed your gaze somewhat. 
As you maybe aware, the Rabbit Hole is deep, and the nuances that pertain to r/Bitcoin are particularly subtle, hence my question, which at first blush appears somewhat naive.

Sorry for the belated response, saving the world keeps me very busy ;p
One has to think outside the box sometimes, and put away the charts and graphs. If you focus on terms like currency, commodities, bonds, etc cetera, you may miss the wood because of the trees.
To simplify matters, you must look upon Bitcoin as a newly discovered resource on planet Earth. 
However, in it's raw state there are only 21,000,000 million Bitcoin that will be available. This resource is not exclusive to one sovereign nation, say like oil or natural gas. 
The incumbent powers and governments are so afraid of change and loss of control, and shall we say other monitory business interests, that they have mistakenly had a knee jerk reaction to attack or demonise it. They rush to protect their worthless fiat, instead of embracing Bitcoin.
All those *"off the record"* agreements behind closed doors by governments, to ban or alienate Bitcoin, are breaking down, as they see its unstoppable ascendance.
For arguments sake, if the **$199 trillion debt figure** from the visualisation chart, was erased by Bitcoin, that would roughly assign a value of  **$9,476,190.47619** per Bitcoin. I think a five year old would understand that at it's present purchase price of say **$750** and rising, is negligible. 
Regrettably we don't have 5 year old's making decisions, but dinosaurs, and we know what happened to their cousins.


First come, first served. Sorry but it's as simple as that. Most government policy makers and mouth pieces, will speak in derogatory terms in respect of Bitcoin, but purchase it privately. They know that it's the tax payers money that will finance the purchase, so at present they will continue to play the anti crypto game. At what price, will they officially jump in? who knows.

Sheeple believe in the illusion of Demockery, long lines of Turkeys voting for Thanksgiving.
The only bright light at the end of this tunnel, will be the beginning of the end. This time it's different, this is not about disenfranchised minorities or some liberal minded hippies talking about global warming *"no offence intended"* . This is about apple pie and the allocated slice.
No matter how many vote for Trump, the incumbent powers that have always been, won't, allow the true result to be known... why? because it's [rigged]( this is nothing new, *cough, cough, Bush* 
When the vacuous Ken &amp; Barbie doll news presenters, mouth the preordained winner as **"Hitlery"**, with such gravitas, through their sphincter shaped mouths, you'll hear a deafening click around America, as the safety is removed from the recently oiled Smith &amp; Western, or AK47, from the plethora of arms held by muricans.
As for the British, well Brexit is not going to happen, I know 17 million of you voted and won, but 3 bent Judges
have just fucked you! over, by pushing this through parliament, so your corrupt Mp's will obfuscate and delay Brexit for ever. In fact Donald Trump has more chance of becoming President, than Brexit ever happening.
However unpalatable the above may appear, this is just another chapter in the evolution of humanity, what is born in violence will be destroyed by violence, yin &amp; yang, shadow &amp; light.
What does this mean for Bitcoin? 
You've heard the expression  fiat is not backed by Gold, but by your government. In layman's terms, that means the amount of TAX they can en**force** you to pay, **enslavement** basically. 
Once they announce **Hitlery** as the winner TAX will become irrelevant, because citizens will not pay it or comply with any de facto government.
So buckle up! and HODL it's going to be a bumpy ride.

Do you think these bastards will give up so much power and the profits from enslavement so easily? Look at the following list of shit referenced as Bitcoin, that's floating around already,..
**Bitcoin Unlimited**
They have been created to dilute, discredit, destroy, all the positive fundamentals of Bitcoin, and generally maintain the status quo of tyranny. And guess what?, they're going to create more!, a smorgasbord of crypto shite, and attempt to associate it with Bitcoin. You'll have,
**FLICKUBit** and etc, etc.

Lets deal with your history, you're descendants of the worst shite! kicked out of the British jails onto the unsuspecting peaceful Aborigines of Australia. 
After a hard days work, of killing raping and pillaging, the founding fathers would relax, by burying Aboriginal babies and small children shoulders deep into the ground, and then see who could kick their heads off the furthest, but that was just a small chapter of  atrocities that have been documented like the [Myall Creek Massacre](
You think a few Karma points will rewrite history, or sway me to join the sheeple like yourself, with your privileged middle class upbringing, and arrogant bullshit, you must have your head up your arse!
Even though **Hitlery** has just been shat upon by muricans, and lost to **Trump** of all people, in spite of the propaganda  and rigged polls from the corrupt media, your programmed pea sized brain still cannot digest that fact, so it must be the fact she is a woman.
Go and re-programme your brain, and research some facts about the candidates, *"the worst in american history by the way"* 
But you won't do that will you, you'll continue to toe the line, and believe everything that comes from the so call media. History is not written by hero's, but by barbaric savages who then get to write the so called Law.

As for pump or dumps, well as they say **"Caveat Emptor"** *(Buyer Beware)*
I have chosen a more difficult long term path lol. I'm more focused on the individual Satoshi &amp; Bit's that make a Bitcoin. I'm of the opinion that each unit already has parity with $1. 
I don't believe in the future that Bitcoin will be the main term of reference, it will be bit's, or Satoshi's If Bitcoin is "Digital Gold" and similar to a Gold Bar, then it will attain a value and scarcity, that whole bitcoins
will not be easily attainable.
The biggest problem I foresee is, finding the product or tech that can only be purchased with Bits or Bitcoin. Maybe iphone12 or some BS like that lol, or "drone cannabis", it's a difficult one haha.

**HODL** Gentlemen,  remember when there is an infestation of troll and shill posts into r/bitcoin that apparently seem decisive, that can only mean one thing, Bitcoin is in ascendance.
Central Banks and world fiat currencies are imploding, the  FED cannot raise interest rates as they would default on due payments in respect of their trillions of debt.
As we can see the R3 consortium in respect of FEDcoin is just another failed imploding experiment to halt the incoming asteroid.
To distract from the above, distraction is required AKA divide and conquer. This current combined attack comprising tactics of flooding troll posts in respect of the following....
**IRS attack on Coinbase**
**difficulty rise**
**push to revive blocksize debate**
**tx spam attack**
**Hard Fork** 
The oldest fiat bank in Italy Medici is going bye, bye  
In fact that Illuminati/mafia bank is just the tip of the iceberg and will expose a level of murder, criminality, and corruption that
will shock the world. **Warning** [this]( **video is NSFW**.

In the future a whole Bitcoin transaction will be quite rare, Satoshi's transactions will become the norm.
 1 Bitcoin consists of **100,000,000** Satoshi's, most people cannot get their heads around these numbers.
1 Satoshi's will hit parity with 1 USA dollar.
The terms that you use, crash, bubble, downturn, make me laugh. 
If people realized they could just spend 20 or 100 dollars and give themselves a chance to be unshackled from financial enslavement, you would see a demand for Bitcoin that would be epic. 
Unfortunately most of the sheeple are watching x- Factor or indulging in some other vacuous past time.
Bitcoin is the **"Cannabis of Money"**^TM and guess what? you don't require any third party permission to use it.

( 2 ) Ten to fifteen sock puppet accounts for sprinkling,
        *"younger the better."*
( 3 ) Half dozen noob accounts, with sensationalist panic 
       headlines, *" preferably less than a week old."*
( 4 ) 4-5 really old and stale MSM blogs, that appear
        really out of date and touch, *"this adds to flavor"*
( 5 )  Then take half a dozen, of pony tail wearing traders in shiny
        suits, and grate.... *"you can usually find these in some dingy
        boiler room, but can be also sourced outside
        under a rock next to trolls, latrines are a good
        place to look"*
( 6 )  Mix all the above well and then **DUMP!** into a  
        steaming pile, and let simmer for 2 hours until it has
        **risen** above the initial price.

The marketeers are not interested. They have been paid to FUD r/bitcoin this week, in an attempt to hijack the narrative.
Shills, FUDSTERS, alleged noobs who buy at $4,900 and then allegedly sell at  $2,500 the next day. It's all a pile of steaming poo!.
**However!** Bitcoin still remains and Bitcoin will still rise and the Banks are IMPLODING.
 
China will allegedly ban, every 3 months whilst fucking the US Dollar with BRICS.
Apart from that see you in the trenches.

I can answer but choose **not** to. If someone repeatedly ask me a dumb question after receiving perfectly sound advice from many others.
So you want to put your gonads into a food processor, because you think it's a good idea and *"that's how you troll"* we don't want to hear about it. There are many freaks, bots, trolls and shills on the internet so you will receive my default answer for that...

It's very simple one Bitcoin is worth **$1,000,000** and valued at present around **$4,600.** 
Even cheese burger munching Joe public can do the above maths, even if they don't fully comprehend the tech or economic benefits.
**However!** one of the biggest and unintentional cheerleaders, is the corrupt establishment and their pus riddle propagandist media, berating Bitcoin at every turn.

It's very simple it's referred to as **Divide &amp; Conquer** utilising any means necessary, to destroy Bitcoin,  therefore the image of crypto in general.    
Scaling is not the problem, **it's when!**..... it's imperative  that scaling occurs safely, without destroying the 100% trusted security &amp; integrity of Bitcoin.

It's the year 2148, and our hero of this story has just arrived home. The heat from his apartment makes him smile smugly, he was one of the lucky ones or **HODLR's** as they're were known pre 2020. 
It' has been nearly 9 years, since the last Bitcoin was mined . It's was still hard to believe that it sold for only $420,000, cheap when you think that one would cost  $12,200,000 at today's value.
Anyway *fortune favors the brave* as they say, in fact it was rumored that he allegedly hedl **BTC 2.8**, but!...  was worth every Satoshi of the ridicule and doubt, that he had faced back then. If only he had bought 2 more when they were only $8,000, he could kick himself now, but how was he to know.
Who could have imagined, that one **Satoshi Unit** would have superseded parity of the US dollar, and then become the world reserve currency. 
The world wide bank collapse of 2018 had cemented Bitcoin's future, they could no longer compete with the low transaction costs and irrevocable trust.
Everything utilised Bitcoin now, however, people rarely mentioned it by name it was all about the **Satoshi's**.

Threat of war maybe, however, before Defcon 2, there might be a more creative or artistic route :-). 
Bitcoin's secure blockchain provides many facets, some that are in development, and some that we can't even imagine. One of those is **"TRUTH"** and another **"TRUST"**, these combined with **"security"**  *"of the non miltarised version"*  are huge building blocks of any strong and secure foundation. 
I was pondering with the idea, that Bitcoin could be utilised on a platform that existed as a virtual/online decentralised world that was physically uninhabited. 
The application would have many milestones or levels  that would function under the ecosystem of Bitcoin, The world could be divided into zones or areas that would represent land, that could be sold in bitcoin and registered to the end user/avatar.
All infrastructure and utilties would also operate in a similar way, but could be a provable asset, an interesting ecosystem to observe. One main criteria of this, would be the absence of any arms or weapons manufacturing. 
I believe the above concept could be implemented to intertwine with the real world.

@_date: 2016-10-21 11:46:52
I believe Bitcoin can solve the above conundrum that you refer to.
I have pondered about similar world solutions, and digital/crypto applications maybe the key. 
Although I'm a cheerleader of Bitcoin and the crypto space in general, the present day human mindset in respect of money and fiat, is a difficult hurdle to overcome.
However, I don't believe political will *"an outdated and tainted concept IMHO"* is the best path to follow, I believe a completely new or decentralised route should be the way forward.
I've also been thinking about a utopia similar to your    Crypto Scientific Democratic Economy or ( **CSDE** ) although, I agree that is a bit of a mouthful ;D). 
I fared no better in the naming of this new Nirvana :-) although I have a few ideas in mind, but simplicity is a difficult umbrella to attain.
First step, practical solutions on how to create this new construct, and where to begin. Like any rectification of a mistake, or improvement by wiping the slate clean could be a good place to start. The enormity of the task at first blush appears to be mind boggling. 
Furthermore, I believe Bitcoin can assist in this task, supported by thinking outside of the box.

*"How do people earn Bitcoin"*? Well Gavin allow me to retort *"How do people earn Gold?"*
Of course the shills will state that Bitcoin has no use case like Gold, only a speculative punt in case of a SHTF scenario, subsequently increasing the demand and price of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin AKA Digital Gold, has access to something that people crave, and the corrupt establishment conveniently forget to mention...  *"wait for it!"*  ....  **Frrrrreeedom^M^M^M^M**  
How much value do you put upon your liberty and privacy? that's the price that's not been factored into the equation. 
If Bitcoin is hard to get, then **fuck it!** anything of subjective value never comes easy Gold or otherwise. And my Digital Gold, like anything else that is scarce, is not cheap
How many employed people in general request to get paid in Gold instead of fiat?, how many employer's comply with that request? 
The paradigm shift will not be swift, but their are two events tipping towards that point. 
The first is Bitcoin development, and the second, the incoming asteroid heading directly at the fiat legacy markets, led by the dinosaurs that maintain them. 
The choice is yours, be ridiculed and book a ticket on the Bitcoin lifeboat, or follow the incumbent shepherd at the helm of the good ship named [Baaa](

@_date: 2017-05-26 17:09:06
I was cutting to the chase, but if you insist. 
Trolling this sub to get your jollies and to spread fake fear, is kinda sad for a person of your age. 
It must twist your guts, watching the slow implosion of the obsolete fiat banking monopoly.  Do you get paid to shill or are you just a volunteer subordinate that has a lot of time on his hands?
Either way, it's sad.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:35:40
I'm trying to help you here, please clarify what type of FUD are you going for? 
**Orange Lamborghini FUD** 
**Arsewipe FUD**, 
**Concern FUD**, 
**Marketing FUD**, 
**I don't have a life FUD**
**I wear a mankini FUD**
**I have Roger's picture on my wall FUD**
**However!**, there are several more, each one applicable to a Roger Token, which one are you specifically referring to?

Bitcoin is **Digital Gold** and more. If there is a fiat collapse in the near future, a new Visa or Master Card replacement type system will **not** 
be the priority.
In a ( SHTF ) scenario, the value of fiat will fall and that will trigger a race to transfer wealth, assets or savings into safe havens. 
If one of those safe havens happens to be Bitcoin, there will be panic buying and FOMO, subsequently this will increase the price and further investment in development and infrastructure.
TLDR: Lets secure the Gold Bar, before we start to worry about how to spend them as coins.

**Bull S^h^i^t^t^t!**
**Firstly**, one of the main intrinsic values of Bitcoin is in the fact that **A** can transact with **B** without **C** **, privately** and **securely**.
**Secondly**, Bitcoin has it's own **Sovereign Jurisdiction**, which is border-less, it's called the **internet**.
**Thirdly** I don't care if my Bitcoin worth **$650** to **$6,000,000** takes 10 mins or 24HR's to get from **A** to **B**, as long as it securely gets there.
**Fourthly**, if and that's a big **IF!**, any future development
like SW &amp; LN or any other new protocol can assist in scaling or transaction speed, these need to be vigorously tested to make sure that they work 100%. Due to the fact, that as soon as there appears to be any issue or bug with the security or validity of the
transaction, all the corrupt fuckers from the elite, and financial establishments will crucify it, these bastards are waiting in the wings for it to fail, and it will be the end of the elusive Honey Badger.  
**Fifthly** when the above has been achieved, you can go and buy your coffee and cheese burger, with 2 Satoshi or whatever the cost maybe.

Unless the altcoin is used to scam people, which the MSM love to report, to give a negative image of Bitcoin.

Ok I'll "geussculate" that maybe one of the  banks in question, is Santander, as for the other country that has a very close relationship, you'll have to disclose that info, for me to make a more informed judgement without opaque clarity.


I do not utilise Kraken or their services, so I'm unfamiliar with their Terms &amp; Conditions (TC), however, I would believe you would be able to repeat them chapter and verse after such a long dispute. 


It's **Monday**, you say they have stated that they would **most likely** unfrozen the account by the end of last week. Well if you are in a European country, the time difference may play a part, as Kraken appears to be based in San Francisco USA.
