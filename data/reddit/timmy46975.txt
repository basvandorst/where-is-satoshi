Allowed Electrum to generate it for me.

Thank you for the advice!

Never shared my seed with anyone but did have a copy on my Google Drive which was potentially compromised a few months back.  I honestly believe that is the culprit.
Thanks for posting a response either way, glad to hear I wasn't alone in this.

Have run a number of scans to find nothing appears to have been compromised.
Thank you for the response.

It's the first issue I've ever had with it and it is likely just my own mistake which caused this.  Electrum itself has been quite reliable.  Devil is always in the details, as the saying goes. \*shrug\*

Never trust any computer 100% if it involves your money, obviously.
Don't know what the fate will be of said BTC but honestly called them gone the second I saw the transaction leave my wallet.  It happens, some lessons cost time and money, like this one.

The test did exactly what I hoped it would.  It proved my theory that the computer itself was not compromised, but at some point the seed had been due to my unsafe practices of having a digital copy, and on a Google Drive no less.  Fool me once, you know the rest.
The original attack was because I got a nasty, nasty bug that compromised my Google Chrome and allowed access to every single passworded account saved in it.  (Spoiler alert, it was a total shitstorm to deal with.)
I've now placed my wallet and all BTC related work on a completely separate and recently wiped clean laptop.  A fresh install that does nothing but my crypto trading.  The seed is hand-written in my desk next to me and will never be typed on any computer aside from the initial verification required by Electrum.
Lesson learned, only out about $180, and thank you for being the first person to say sorry for my loss.
...But it was sincerely my own fault, and I knew the risks going in and still do.  Still though, good on ya for saying sorry. :)
Said transaction remains in the aforementioned BC1 wallet unspent.  It hasn't moved since the "ghost" transfer happened.

That seems to be the consensus I'm running into.  Poor storage procedure on my part of the seed (as a document).
Just not sure I ever had a breach where someone would have obtained it.
Regardless, I know a number of solutions to prevent it going forward.  Not much of a loss but a lesson learned none-the-less.

Seed potentially compromised, don't know how/when because my system itself was not compromised insofar as I am aware.  I realize that isn't the same as actually knowing 100% sure it wasn't.
The wallet is only ever used as a transfer wallet so the one transaction is all that was moved (which was the full contents of the wallet at the time).  And it also has not moved from the wallet it moved to, just sitting there.

I have actually ran that exact test and am just keeping an eye on the new wallet.  Wrote that seed down on paper, no documentation anywhere on the computer.
Going to assume that somehow, someone got my seed.  Turns out I had a copy of it on my Google Drive, which may well have been compromised a few months back.  That may be all there was to this whole problem.  Just surprising because I've made many transactions between then and now and only now was there an issue.

Thanks for the recommendations!
