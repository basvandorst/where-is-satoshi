I agree. Most of these crypto puzzles seem too random. I think a good puzzle need to have a central theme and direction, and make them easier to see in the puzzle. Knowing this direction does not mean knowing the solution. It still require huge effort to reach the solution even knowing the direction. But at least it will be less random and time wasting.

The 0.2 puzzle requires the solution to 0.1 puzzle. Why did you make 310 puzzle solvable without the 0.31 puzzled solved first?

Just to quote another reddit user on this issue:  
 
"There is no side-chain involved here, just a transaction that keeps being manipulated before it is actually broadcast to miners for inclusion into a block.
What he's talking about is leaving a transaction unconfirmed so that the balance can be negotiated between parties.
This is basically what LN purports to do, but between a set amount of parties, and not another whole network (side-chain with no POW) to replace the security of Bitcoin as LN is trying to do."
