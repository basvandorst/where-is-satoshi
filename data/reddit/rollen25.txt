And I agree that we will see a the biggest wealth transfer. But as of now millennials are busy buying dumb shit
@_date: 2019-11-27 05:31:39
OP be like..

I’m a millennial and I am 20 and this comment is nothing but facts... millennials worry about stupid things, they worry about looks, they just want to be connected with what everybody is doing. The amount of money they waste on useless shit is unreal. I’d say more than 90% don’t care about investing in crypto or anything else. Saving is not in their minds.

Lol buy when we are back at $14k?
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:38:21
Nope sorry lol it’s gone
@_date: 2019-08-18 21:49:49
If it’s not Bitcoin then what is it?
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:26:23
Nah I’m just stacking up, don’t care about the current value of my investments. They will be worth it in 5 years ;)
@_date: 2019-08-18 22:11:48
This is not how I actually buy Bitcoin. I was just giving him a way to buy Bitcoin since he couldn’t buy in the UK and Robinhood is available in the UK so ��‍♂️
@_date: 2019-08-18 21:25:12
0/10 answer? I made it clear that the Bitcoin won’t be able to be used.

Search for DAI CDP, it’s legit
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:45:58
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:08:44
Aww, you went in at $20k? Sorry, you’re a fucking dumbass.
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:30:20
Robinhood is good... no fees. Only bad thing is that you won’t be able to transfer it. 
Coinbase is good but fees will crush your $10 into maybe $7 :P

If you’re going big into crypto just buy a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S or a Trezor.
@_date: 2019-02-16 20:31:42
Imagine thinking it’s not

You’d be better off to let me leverage your BTC. Now that would’ve been bank.
@_date: 2019-09-08 03:12:46
Yea I just pay the bills every week and the rest goes on crypto
@_date: 2019-09-05 14:33:11
Some people never learn? You acting like I’ve been fucked over by alts like 100000 times lmao. Alts will make a comeback wether you like it or not.
@_date: 2019-09-03 22:35:25
������ “TOP CLASS” LMAO
@_date: 2019-09-05 11:38:35
Good, give us the cheapest ALT prices.. fire sale ��
@_date: 2019-09-11 11:45:54
But first let’s retest $3k real quick
@_date: 2019-09-10 01:16:22
On the bright side. Alts will do these type of multipliers for longer periods of time :)
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:34:17
Decentralization is a good idea, but won’t be allowed... anywhere, ever. This doesn’t come from my decisions but the governments. Long term; centralized projects are your best bet.
@_date: 2019-09-08 01:36:07
Dude, I’m 20 and I’m like 95% into crypto and I just keep adding. I’m not advising you to do so. I just believe in the space and I know it’s going places.
So if you truly believe in this, you know it’s revolutionary go BALLS deep. If not maybe 10% of each paycheck isn’t bad at all.
@_date: 2019-09-11 02:38:45
Oh god ��‍♂️. If people really think there won’t be another alt season they are FUCKING RETARDED. Bitcoin needs to lose dominance, like it or not. Whales accumulate waaaay more Bitcoin in alts. After Bitcoin is done running up whales will 100% do a move into alts.
