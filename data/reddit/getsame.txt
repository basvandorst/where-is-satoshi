@_date: 2017-10-18 10:03:57
Bitcoin price tanked 15 days before the split on August 1st and then went up so I'm waiting for it to fall even further until it gets up again. Hope we're not in for a boom soon.

@_date: 2017-10-22 07:44:06
I'd think about this. 1M is enough for a lifetime. Why not bail out and get it all in fiat? Bitcoin is far from garantueed to succeed and fiat is still way more important.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:04:59
It may be the only reason it exists, but let's be honest, the reason it's so successful is because most of the people want to get rich off of it. I mean just look at the facebook sites of the exchanges, full of Indians probably not knowing a shit about the system, only there for their profit lol

Pretty much everything stokes me about this show.
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:57:17
My 2 cents: 
For Russia and Estonia it would mean a gradual decrease of banks and basically making them invalid. That would cause panic investing in cryptorouble and cause the price to skyrocket. Early investors get rich, late ones get piss-poor because they can't afford to have as much as others. A redistribution of wealth. While this isn't a bad thing, a national cryptocurrency just further divides poor from rich. I don't see why Russia and Estiona would do that?
In relation to Bitcoin, most Russians would probably switch to cryptorouble since it's going to be much user friendly than Bitcoin and less risky. If other nations follow, it's likely for them to push Bitcoin away from the market of crypto and heavily taxing Bitcoin so "their" national currency pulls through.
Tricky situation.

Because you should never ever gamble with money you don't have. Yes, it is a gamble. And because if a big corp introduces a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin won't stand a chance.

Bitcoin is something completely different than other bubbles. All other trends relied on companies. Bitcoin is decentralised. As long as there won't be a worldwide ban there is no critical reason for it to pop.

Haha it's always the same. Armchair experts coming out of the shadows and telling you what's going to happen.
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:15:37
Bitcoin is a bubble. The fact we made a plus of more than $1000 in just a week proves it. It's getting closer and closer to becoming mainstream and once it is, it's going to burst. Denying that because you don't want to believe it won't make it less real. 
Get in while you still can but don't forget to gtfo as soon as it goes mainstream.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:05:22
You say all this as if Bitcoin was a new paradigm. It's not. It's got way too many obstacles and in its current form it's far from suited for a worldwide currency. Also, who the fuck wants to use a currency that has rapid growths and falls just as quickly and has every screaming sign of a bubble? Other than inexperienced people like you, nobody else.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:02:12
And there goes my dream to possess 1 BTC
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:13:19
Yeah I only study economics, no idea about it though.
What you both fail to grasp is a bigger picture. You just look at the price and think hurr supply and durr demand makes success wheeew! 
Wrong. There are so many other factors to consider. 
Just to name a few of them: 
- National cryptocurrencies become a thing, pushing Bitcoin out of the market since they are much easier to use and your everyday Joe doesn't give a shit about decentralization 
- Bitcoin might not live up to expectations. According to your basic thinking, the dotcom bubble would have never burst, the real estate bubble would have never burst, hell even the tulip bubble. 
- Bitcoin will be a revolution but might quickly be replaced by better cryptos. Bitcoin is a prototype, other cryptos do a much better job. The only thing that Bitcoin has going for it is that it was the first big thing. Imagine EU crypto. Bitcoin would NEVER stand a chance
- International Bitcoin bans. Whoops, Bitcoin is going down
- Heavy governmental taxing. Whoops, Bitcoin is going down
So please, just because you know how a supply curve and a demand curve and how that results into a perfect market looks like you really have a narrow mindset. Go educate yourself.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:19:08
Because Bitcoin can't keep its expectations. Once it goes mainstream, other competitors will develop their own currency and Bitcoin will simply have no chance against it. Think of Google making their own crypto called GCoin. Google have everything to push Bitcoin from the market. Nobody except BTC enthusiasts cares that BTC is decentralised. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:42:06
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:57:55
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:44:54
E-Coin in the US, Bitcoin in China
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:12:36
Yes, it is the goal but it's a stupid goal. First off, it's not good for the economy. It just makes the rich even richer right now and that is definitely not what we need right now. Once it goes mainstream it will also get heavily taxed. In my country, Austria where we have one of the highest tax systems in the EU, it's bound to a wonder we don't have to tax it yet.
Then there are other points. Who keeps mining and confirming transactions once fees get lower? How does Bitcoin win against other crytocurrencies? Once Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. start publishing their own currency there is simply no chance for Bitcoin to succeed. Corporate crypto's would have better accessibility, better support, more insurance, a ban from illegal markets - thus also being approved by governments - and just the popular brand on a crypto does wonders. It's naive to believe that Bitcoin's only advantage called Le Decentralisation outperforms any other crypto. Apart from a small enthusiastic group, mainstream doesn't care about that.
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:58:37
People are trusting Google with all their data and personal info. I'm not saying Google will be a monopoly, but there is going to be competition and Bitcoin won't last. 
And are you seriously comparing the gold price rate to the Bitcoin price rate?

Blockchain, Coinify
@_date: 2017-05-28 07:26:34
I'm not sure why nobody gets what you mean, it's an interesting approach. However, what good would it do? It's basically the same as holding. If you have offline coins at 2K and the price falls to 1.5K, then rises to 2.5K and you put them back in, what difference does it make compared to waiting out the low phase?
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:31:21
People like graphs more than sheer numbers. That's the reason. Predicting bitcoin is hard.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:58:56
I'm certain it will rise again and even beyond $3000. Then you should sell if you don't want to hold.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:49:28
It rose way too long for that imo. I think it will fall for a bit more now and then sloooowwwlllly build up again. We'll see :)

Look at the price, not the chart.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:30:27
No, we never know. Trends can happen in a matter of hours but they can also be applied to years. For example, we all thought we had passed ATH and the bull trap and are in decline. Now the price is rising again. It's impossible to always predict accurately. Other shares like Tesla or Google are more predictable due to upcoming products and announcements but BTC is very different. 
For all we know, we could have a new ATH in the next few days. It could also only be a short peak and then continue to fall way down below. YA NEVER KNOWWWWW
