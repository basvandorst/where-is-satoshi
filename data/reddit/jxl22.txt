I'm not advocating buying drugs from 3rd parties. Just making a point that pharmacies arnt completely above board 100% of the time.

I don't know who it was, but I remember watching something a couple months ago. 
There are countless stories about pharmacies diluting drugs to basically nothing and selling it.

How is this not fucking common sense?!
Yeah taxes are so EVIL! We should go back to the good ol' days  of the feudal system. AH those were the days!

And how are law enforcement , courts, and other security services going to be paid?  
If you want to replace government entities with the private sector i'd be cool with that. But you have NO way to fund it. Who's funding these 


Hows the money getting from the open market to the services we need? Taxation is the only way. 
Privately run law? not really sure what these means and im about to go to bed. but who the fuck is going to have power to make a "private law"
