Ohh nah you’re kinda lost. What really happens is that you deposit say 1,000$, bank will use that 1,000$ to create 10,000$ loan, and guess where the 9000$ coming from? Thin air.

Well? If you can’t afford a car without a loan that’s your problem.
Loans are bad.. and this system is proven to be bad. When the bank takes my money and loans 90% of it for you to afford your new car, and then you get fired from your job and can’t pay the loan. That’s fucked up.

Nerds in 1913 &amp; nerds in 2000 are much much different.
Also the internet nerds didn’t have plans to dominate the world, and these nerds also didn’t represent 1/4 of the world on financial aspect when they created the internet.
These nerds never took secret trips to “duck hunting island” to discuss the creation of the internet and never wanted to merge powers in order to create a cartel. They also didn’t represent biggest businesses in the country, and none of them was a Senator.

As I always say and I’m sure many will agree with me... idc what is the price of bitcoin as of right now, wish it can go back to 1$ so I’d buy LOADS of it... one day people from the future will see use as history, bitcoin is something that just can’t disappear, and if it does - I will lose my faith in humanity and liberty.

With all the respect to the chairman, no matter what you’ve done in your life, you can’t just come up one day and call gold (the store of value that people used for 3000+ years), a speculative store of value.

Lol come on...
*Before you yell at me please consider that I’m a huge bitcoin advocate.
But these kind of videos &amp; headings ain’t going to make bitcoin what we want it to be and not even making any progress.
Most of the banks obviously let you down in the long run, but saying that the bank let you down because your credit card (has nothing to do with the bank, it’s the credit card company’s product) didn’t work well on some atm so go buy bitcoin bye bye , is childish and will make us look stupid if there will be people researching on bitcoin and seeing this as a an example of bitcoin advocating &amp; enthusiasm.
Second of all, just so you know most of the credit cards work worldwide, you could just try to pay with it for something small at a shop so you know it works upfront, and if not.. you got many other various services that can done the same and much easier user experience than bitcoins atm. 
And last, I don’t even want to know what total fees / spread you have paid in order to get those bitcoins into your wallet, because visa &amp; many other services I was talking about earlier can do cheaper.
*Please note that I do not use those apps, and I am a strong bitcoin advocate. But this is just stupid.

The reason people have trusted governments with finances was because the government had issues notes (dollars) that were backed by REAL money which was gold, since the creation of the fed (1913), and the abortion of gold standard (1971) people became dumber than they were with finances, that’s the reason the majority doesn’t even know/care what they have in their pockets.
Don’t confuse government with the constitution, you’re most likely referring to the good will of the constitution, but now days things are different, the government is now growing into an unstoppable monster.. comparing it to the government that was 243 years ago isn’t the right thing to do, things are different these days.
People are all about social media and likes these days, no one really cares about privacy, finances, markets, and all the other things that the government invades.
I used to claim the same thing as you do now, when I wasn’t properly educated about money, finances and economics.

I was giving a crazy example which is most likely never happen, but if all the governments ban mining, there will be no bitcoin.
How do you enforce? Good question but the government doesn’t really need to worry.
They just sign a new law and it’s up to the people wether to follow or neglect it, some will continue mining for years, some will get caught and jailed, and others will not risk their freedom for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:12:37
Bitcoin shouldn’t be treated as currency for the same reason you don’t show up with a pile of gold in the supermarket.
Bitcoin should be treated as a store of value, there are plenty of other coins that could be used as day to day medium of exchange / “currency”.
Bitcoin is there to keep your savings SAFE from manipulation and supply expansion, as of right now it’s market cap &amp; adoption is still too low for the price to be less volatile.

The money that is based on nothing is actually a currency that your government prints using some complicated to understand systems like the fed, while OBLIGATING you to use it, that’s CURRENCY not MONEY.
Money is something that based on people trust. If you trust that my X gold bars worth your X sheeps, then the money is based on our trust. That’s why gold is will be there no matter what governments will ever try to do with it.
You can’t come up after 6000 years that people are using gold as money and post that money is based on nothing lol.

But I still believe that we will not see any price around 19K as we’ve seen in Dec/Jan in the close future.
Because the bubble have been bursted and it brought a lot of despair. It will take time for those who have been damaged/heard bad news about it.
You have to understand that people should go deep into understanding BTC tech to believe in it. And most of them.. won’t do it as I see this right now.

Well I’m not sure about this because with all the love and wishes to btc success we still have to agree that it has no actual backup.. it’s made and based on people’s faith..
Ok so we’re the people and we believe in it. Right now we’re a small community, and we will have to grow to enormous levels to force the governments to take this seriously..
They’re stronger than us, and they like to know everything about you and your activities, btc does the opposite.. so it’s against their plans, and this is why I don’t see btc going back to what it was in the near future.

That’s why diamonds wasn’t considered as medium of exchange.
No no and no. People consider it valueable because it has been proved as medium of exchange for years.
No and no again. Gold isn’t held or being invested as computer numbers. People that invest in gold are most likely aware of the fed stories, they won’t do business with a brokerage house who will sell them CFDs or IOU.
Most of the investing is gold these days are in physical bullions with guarded storage.

People like you have been talking since 1929. Gold have never fallen in price against the dollar / any other commodity since then.
Simple rule of supply and demand? Lol everything existing follows that rule, even the shoes you wear. Gold is valueable because it have been trusted for over 3000 years of trading, limited quantity, and other characteristics that sound money has.
You percentage calculation is funny, you’ve just threw numbers without any back up, and idc what article you’ll post here unless it was done by a known independent group.
Just to let you know, most of the jewelry you see around is made out of 14K gold, which is far from being the gold people invest in.
And yes ‘paper gold’ is being traded in trillions of dollars in CYCLES. 
There’s a huge difference between people who TRADE for profit, and those who INVEST as hedging.

They raise against the dollar, not against other assets.
1. Maybe you’re a lip but smarter but I’m pretty sure that many many people out of the US are holding cash / bank deposits as savings. At least that’s what the majority of my country does.
2. Well that’s what you think, I work in that area and I know these institutions don’t have much of those at all, they hold things like stocks, options, futures.
3. The borrower can default so your money is in risk.
4. Banks are creating new money when they’re giving a loan, so its a pretty much big player.
5. Never said it’s bad, but you stated that your home and mortgage is what going to hedge you against the inflation, nope it’s not.

@_date: 2019-06-07 18:21:17
1. Gold is not guaranteed by no government since the abolishment of the bretton woods (gold standard) in 1973.
2. Gold values for 2000 years because it’s easy to transact, tangible &amp; limited quantity, bitcoin is the same. So bitcoin is here as gold v2.
If bitcoin has no intrinsic value as you think then gold should be worthless because the most you can make out of it is useless jewelry.

Even if it vanishes tomorrow. I’ll be still proud to remind myself where I came from.
@_date: 2019-06-29 09:50:12
Why? Hmmm...
1. Because whatever you hold in cash (fiat) for time gets devaluated.
2. When it gets devaluated, that one guy with 50m in his acc probably gets rich when I get poorer, so it’s principal reason.
3. Because I don’t trust banks, I don’t trust them to choose who to loan my money to.
4. Because whenever a bank or other huge institution fails you’re the one who’s going to pay for the bail out.
5. Mortgage? So now you’re tied to a loan, and if everything goes as planned you’ll pay your loan and live a good life in your house, but what if you won’t be able to pay it for some reason? We never know what happens tomorrow.
Taking a mortgage and having an inflation since then is a good business move, but do you have ALL your fiat possessions moving? Incase not, then you hate inflation.

"The dollar is the reserve currency of the world, and everybody wants to hold dollars," Mnuchin said on "Lou Dobbs Tonight." "And the reason why they want to hold dollars is because the U.S. is a safe place to have your money, to invest and to hold your assets."
That was a good one.
The only reason this shit remains the worlds reserve currency today is because the majority doesn’t even know or care what they have in their pockets, in their eyes, as long as they have internet connection and can access Instagram, snap chat and tiktok, everything is ok.

What you’ve just did is copying words from google lol, I’ll explain what is money:
Money is something that cannot be created out of nothing, is accepted by the other party (medium of exchange), easy to carry, and easy to count. And that’s why gold was used for 3000 years before Roosevelt abandoned it and Nixon ended it in 71.
Bitcoin has the same characteristics, but the protocol is not ready yet. That’s why it’s risky now, cause this is just a project that is going well for 11 years now.
See, the war we fight as bitcoin enthusiasts, is not the “pay less fees war” or “anonymity war”.
We fight against the fed with the power of the governments who abuse our monetary system for their interests. Idc if PayPal takes 5$ fee and bitcoin can do the same for 1$ fee. 4$ won’t kill me but inflation and one world government will.

Well, lemme tell you a story.
Rome was the strongest empire back in the days, and they wanted to expand.
To expand, you need to acquire more soldiers, to get soldiers to work for you, you gotta pay them, and to pay them you needed gold. But you can’t just print gold.. so devaluating gold by mixing it with other metals was the solution to the problem. 
At first, everything went smooth, for years.. but then, I don’t know the exact years and time between the incidents, but people have realized what was done and that whole thing caused hyperinflation.
Rome didn’t fall because it lost strength suddenly, what makes an empire strong is its finances, till these days.

You guys completely ignoring a very crucial aspect called “hyperinflation”.
United States cant continue pumping newly created money into the economy forever (QE), one day it will come to an end.
History shows that EVERY empire that used its power to inflate the supply of its currency, ended up in misery, exactly what happened to the Rome empire, but they did not print dollars, or insert digits on a digital system, they mixed pure gold with other metals and created 2 gold coins out of 1, it worked well for years, but not forever, same happens with the United States right now, bitcoin can reach 1,000,000,000$ under these terms.
Stop asking for the price, store of value isn’t measured by the current price, but in what it can buy you, and how it can protect your wealth in future.

“Questionable laws” is a soft name for this cartel/monopoly.
@_date: 2019-12-21 20:59:43
Typical answer from the misinformed
Banks, well bankers are the ones who created the fiat, so they can maintain their monopoly in the finance business (first it was the fed, expanded to central banks, and later expanded to the commercial banks).
Banks operate under very corrupt laws, they can basically do whatever they want and take whichever risks they wish, and all that is on your back, because if you will have a business and you’ll fail, you’re the one in charge of the bankruptcy, and will have to pay for it.
If bank fails, the government will bail them out with newly created money, which is a promise to tax you in the future.
Banks are worse then the whole concept of fiat, my friend.

Well at first I was about keep on scrolling down cause I was like “wtf a rapper knows about bitcoin and money” but I took a chance and listened to it.
Akon have surprised me pretty much and I liked his explanation.
But I’ll have to admit that this conversation sounds like all the conversations I had when I’ve tried explaining bitcoin to people.
People are just stuck at thinking that bitcoin is there to make it easier for people to send money through their phones to people overseas with less fees..
Or they trust their government so much that they try so hard to ignore all the facts you’re pointing at them.
And that’s why idk when bitcoin will be the next thing, I believe that once the majority understands money and accept the facts, bitcoin will rocket. That can happen tomorrow or 20 years from now I don’t know... the only reason that bitcoin doesn’t worth 1m$ is lack of people’s knowledge IMO.. bitcoin is the craziest thing that people have invented in the finance sector in the last 100 years.. you people should be thankful for someone like Satoshi who have set there for all that time and invented a whole system that is decentralized and supposed to take care of your money wise freedom and worry.

If gold wasn’t money it wouldn’t be traded for 1.5k per ounce in 2019, the only thing you can actually use it for is jewelry. If you think that it’s being traded at this high price because of the potential it has for jewelry you’re wrong. It’s being traded at this value because people see it as money which hedges against the dollar and other fiat currencies. Same with bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-09-20 12:15:44
Laughing won’t make bitcoin great.

Pretty much happened to me from the day I started til now
I used to argue with everyone on this earth on how good is bitcoin and why everyone should invest in it, I was trying to explain money and change the world, I was checking the price every day and every 2% movement made me investigate what cause that.
But today? I don’t really care about the price no more.. I bought the last deep and as long as bitcoin won’t get back to 3.5k, I am profiting.
I plan to invest for the next 3-4 years, so why would I care about the price nowadays? Bitcoin is a solid thing
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:59:39
I use the same currency as you use lol but I don’t consider it as money. That’s the difference between me and you.
Money should represent a store of value and fiat is your worse bet on store of value....

Why would he dislike Ulbricht lol
Trump is a president
Ulbricht is just another guy with life sentence that has his family running petitions for him, I’ll be surprised if trump have called his name more than a few times in his carrier.
Trump has other problems to deal with..

Getting sick of this pure bullshit on a sub that meant to be a little bit more serious than posting this kind of crap every time bitcoin makes a move.
Makes me want to quit can’t take this eye cancer no more
Do you guys even understand bitcoin or just playing around and getting excited of price movements?

I don’t have problem sharing my information with the site I’m trying to pay to which using bitpay as their processor, but I am not willing to share my information with a company that has no need in that and just forwarding my payments to its original destination.
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:16:28
It should have a reason to be traded at this value... and the reason is because it’s money that you can’t just create or speed up its creation... you don’t see oranges being traded for 1.5k per orange and and orange is way more useful than gold lol
@_date: 2019-09-03 20:37:39
I’m willing to pay X for their service, X using Y as their payment processor, X knows my identity because I am willing to share it with them, as I trust them, so why would Y need my information if all they’re doing is forwarding payments to make accounting “easier” to companies.
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:37:32
Yeah, same with bitcoin. Bitcoin has many of golds characteristics.
Gold might not be the perfect standard for “money” if you use the word money for something that you can buy with at shops, but if you use the word money as something liquid that can’t be manipulated, than its money. Fiat is a currency.
I can trade gold for oil, or I can trade it for a house.
Liquidity plays a high roll here, that’s why I’ll have to transfer my gold into currency like USD to buy a house. But that doesn’t change the fact that gold is money and a store of value while the dollar being just local currency (USD is actually worldwide but other currencies are nothing more that local trading notes that pretend to have value).
Fiat is more liquid than gold / bitcoin but it’s still not money but a currency.
Money meaning:
* Unit of account
* Medium of exchange
* Portable 
* Durable
* Divisible
* Fungible
* Store of value 
Gold fits under these categories perfectly, fiat fits to all as well but not store of value..
To remind you, fiat (notes) were created in order to make it easier for the modern world to buy and sell stuff, the whole idea was to deposit your gold to a bank and the bank gives you notes which basically says that you own X gold in their bank so you can trade easily.. and whenever you want to cash out you bring the notes and they give you your gold back...

Please remind me what is the meaning of premium on bitfinex

No prediction about btc. But I recently bought some ETH because I think 104$ (price I bought at) is too low for this concept.
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:21:46
Why not
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:57:34
Thank you for the answer, I get it better now. Not Ver and his friends didn’t create something similar, they did something a little bit different which failed because of it and the end, no?
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:01:55
So much NAH dude. Believe me no strong currency in the world got “hit” when btc went to 19k.
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:54:59
That’s not bad, that’s awesome. Less people will hold their btc without owning the private keys, which basically means the btc is just appearing on your acc but you don’t own it
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:51:09
Not a smart answer at all. I said let’s say I got the power to make millions of people to believe me and etc. what is special and unreplaceable I’m bitcoin that will make it better than my coin. 
If you can’t answer that, please don’t comment.
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:58:53
So wait it was stuck because he sent from non segwit to segwit? Or because network is high right now?
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:15:15
Hodl just because everyone said so..?
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:46:09
Why is he even getting interviews? Why is he even relevant to bitcoin?
I bought my phone and paid with btc at its peak, can anyone schedule an interview with me?
@_date: 2018-12-04 05:03:24
Ok cool
@_date: 2018-12-30 14:46:09
Dude sent 5$ and paid 137k$ in fees. Probably typo between the sections 
@_date: 2018-12-03 15:11:39
The protest are against the prices going up, this has absolutely nothing to do with btc nor France citizens care about btc
Not everything with cash has something to do with btc 
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:20:11
Haha yeah so let’s go all in and HODL just because we believe in future cash and go broke.
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:37:36
That’s a good one!
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:38:50
What’s wrong with comparing btc to fiat value? You, me, and 95% of all btc users got our btc for fiat.
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:47:31
S.o. As?
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:47:15
Ahh thank you for the smart answer.
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:46:08
Yeah but let’s say I’m ready for anything, what basically makes bitcoin better? Or I can just replace that coin if I put in the work lol
@_date: 2019-05-10 23:45:38
Show them this one when they start bragging how useful are other cryptocurrency lol. Shitcoins.
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:52:39
No how. Most of the time futures are just a bet between 2 parties, they just bet on the price for profits, they don’t really want the goods. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 15:38:32
That “based on nothing” belief brought your btc to 19k and straight back to 3k.
@_date: 2019-05-01 02:27:22
That’s something obvious, that’s why its laughable
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:16:41
Cringe + stoopid
@_date: 2018-12-04 08:58:59
Imagine the transaction would somehow disappear��
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:56:06
I didn’t buy to cash out in 2 weeks. Let’s see one term so I don’t really care what short term does irrational sales shows.
@_date: 2018-12-19 22:02:15
Asking because I am lacking that knowledge and I’m asking in order to know more. And you give a reply that actually makes me stupid ����‍♂️
@_date: 2018-12-10 05:44:01
How about bitcoin mixers? How about selling face to face? How about sending it to an exchange, buying other coin, sending to another exchange &amp; repeat, then withdraw, huh ?
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:23:34
@_date: 2018-12-19 22:47:48
Thank you 
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:54:07
As far as I understand proof is work is just a proof of work? What if I prove my coin is stable and working properly?
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:08:59
Aha nice man.
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:00:34
Haha yeah I’m sure you like seeing your investings going down!
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:14:57
Thanks for the tip.
Won’t connect my phone to no app as 2fa no more!
@_date: 2018-12-04 19:02:38
Don’t think it has anything to do with btc my man. Btc raised to 19k because brainless people “invested” in it back in the day, they don’t understand the whole concept, they take it as an asset like house, etc. they don’t understand this is a currency.
@_date: 2018-12-04 15:27:57
Ahahahaha �� what a smart guy! Putting 40k on phone app without a backup, should be the next Elon musk 
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:54:57
But is it okay that he sent from 3 address to bc1, right?
@_date: 2019-05-01 02:25:42
They’re losing value because their buying power becomes less caused by the rise of prices, that’s it.
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:56:34
Bitcoin cannot be less anonymous than what it is right now.. no one can control it, ever
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:15:00
What country shut down your bank account for buying bitcoin?
