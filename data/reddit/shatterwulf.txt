I keep hitting enter but it still says 0.

And the severance likely would have come with a non-disclosure agreement about what he'd learned.

Right, The last thing I need to do is drunkenly smash my Bitcoin wallet after I can't get it to buy me food at 2am.

American reporting in; I'm glad I checked before going to bed. I don't have much to lose (bought in at 30), but I'd like to buy more.

Everyone born before 1995 recognizes a floppy disk.

Well it could...but in all likelihood it won't.

I agree with your reasoning; and I think it will certainly effect how this faucet will receive donations in the future. I know I won't do so.

Best reason to not put your eggs in one basket.

People did donate to the faucet under the impressions that it would be redistributed to new users (the point of a faucet) not to be given to people who've already made plenty of money off bitcoin.

In Denver you'd be hard pressed to find anything but PBR at that price, at least in a bar.

In other news: There's flooding in Colorado! People in Mozambique unaffected.

To be honest, it can never be widespread until more than a few hundred places on the whole planet (physical retail locations) start letting you directly use bitcoin to buy things.

To be brutally honest, for the price of a pack of cigarettes, you can get ingredients for a weeks worth of lentil soup (which can be made with a hotplate, which I guarantee is a more common possession amongst the homeless than a laptop)

Now we can look forward to this (or another permutation) being posted every time someone posts about a bitcoin business.

How is keeping a laptop and smartphone with you make you less likely to be mugged than keeping a small amount of cash? I mean, someone could just as easily rob him of his laptop and phone and he'd be just as fucked since he wouldn't be able to earn more or access his bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-23 04:51:21
Yeah, I don't see why more people don't think of this as a bailout of sorts.
edit: I mean, I know why he did it, it makes it seem fair; but seems like an interesting move given bitcoins' decentralization.

I live in Denver and you'd mostly only find PBR (cans or draft) for ~$3. For a proper beer you'd be likely spending +$4 unless the place is kind of dive-y.
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:41:15
Yeah, investing your entire future in a market that's hardly more than 3 years old isn't being a "risky investor" it's just being silly. It's like bringing your life savings to the casino.

But even if you can buy bitcoins 99% of people would have a hard time integrating actually buying regular everyday things with BTC, because so few retail shops accept it. So for the vast majority of people bitcoin will really be lacking in practicality. 
There doesn't seem to be an advantage to using BTC when its mostly just adding an extra step to a transaction of getting the coins (and paying exchange fees) in the first place, just to be able to use them at maybe a few shops in town.
@_date: 2013-03-23 05:01:32
Like put it back in the faucet. That's the whole point of one in the first place.

Not really, but the more moderate people tend to be downvoted when the market is doing really well and upvoted when it's not.

I guess, I just remember in elementary/middle school in the mid 90's we all had floppy disks with our names on them to save our schoolwork we did in the computer lab.
