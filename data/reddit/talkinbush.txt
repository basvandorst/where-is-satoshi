That is probably what happen.
Only other way is when my HHD wiped it self about 6 months a go and i had it restored the employees took the .dat. but that highly unlikely.
I have setup some paper wallets now. Hopefully that goes better.
I would tip your if I had any BTC left.
Thanks for you help

I also tried the key log killer and it found no key loggers.
Yea I'm using Malwarebytes and it dose not do much.

@_date: 2014-03-15 17:24:35
Okay, thanks for the quick response
My paraphrase was OTfpRltE60419
