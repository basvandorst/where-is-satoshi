I love that bitcoin is not controlled by some company, or a government!

I think bitcoin will decide to go left initially, but after a couple of miles he realizes he's in the wrong direction and turns around. Right as he turns around a car drives right at him and let him skyrocket in to the air, to about 10.000 feet. Over there he catches as plane, and flies back home.

Off course, China is always right about something connected to the internet. My apologies.

I can't wait till there's a southpark episode about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:59:37
That's a new all time high!
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:54:08
Thanks a lot!

Bitcoin is not an investment, it is a new currency. 
If you want to invest, try stock markets.

Want to buy some imaginary internet points, for some other imaginary internet points? Yeah sure, let's make a deal!
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:43:04
Does anyone have a quick translation of the main points?

Bitcoin will grow even bigger in 2014, so Satoshi for person of the year 2014!

A bitcoin or any other altcoin wallet is not designed for holding different types of coins. It's also more secure to have separate wallets for the different coins.

I think mining bitcoin isn't worth it nowadays, since the difficulty is pretty high. Also, hundred pounds is not enough to buy hardware to mine. You best bet on making a profit with bitcoins is to just buy some for a hundred pounds.

Thank you! I was figuring it out myself, and thought: "why is this not in the sidebar? A lot of people use it in this subreddit.

There is something like this for an android phone. It's called Simple Bitcoin Widget.

It works great, you can choose between different markets, auto-updates as well as manual update.
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:08:05
Nice, glad I could help!
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:53:13
Hopefully everywhere!

Does anyone have a quick explanation about what the goal is of Bitdango?
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:59:33
As mentioned by they have their own bot. It's basically the same concept, but a different bot. 
You can find all the documentation [here](

Now one with an [Umbrella](
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:48:25
I haven't seen it I'm afraid. Can you provide a quick link? It sounds awesome!
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:29:09
Thanks a lot man!
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:10:15
Thanks! The ad looks amazing ;)
But on a more serious side, I think too many people would take advantage of this by just making new reddit accounts and give each other upvotes.

Sign up at kraken.com, get tier 2 validation. Go to the tab "funding". Click on euro. You can find a sepa address plus a unique code, sent money to the address and it will appear on kraken in a couple of days. Then you can buy bitcoins with the money you deposited

Fuck, I hadn't thought about the game for a couple of years now!

A consumer in China can fund a bitcoin account via their bank, but only if they verify with something like their social security number at the exchange. 
A bank can't hold bitcoins itself, and con't offer any products based on bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:31:24
I think there are already ATM's where you can buy bitcoins somewhere in the U.S.A.

Idea for new startup: Start an online gamble / poker website which uses only bitcoin as currency. 
10/10 would visit.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:05:42
Good idea! I just edited it.
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:38:43
This is actually a pretty good idea, instead of complaining, help fixing the problem.
