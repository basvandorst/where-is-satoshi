Whats evil is when Im tapping your mom from behind I like to look at  that picture of you and your dad fishing.  I do not know why I do this,  probably the same reason you are here. Bored

Ha, could you imagined last year anyone talking about a hedge fund.  I think its great progress.  Thanks for posting it.

thanks for the advice

I think they are using prison labor to make fud comments here every time bitcoin heads down. Why not, its the same fuckers who call  you to get a new credit card/insurance policy and so on.  Last I heard you only have to pay them .30 cents an hour.
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:50:48
Haha, another one of those prison guys that they pay .30 cents an hour to spread FUD.  Probably another child molester used by the banks.  Shame.

Wow, visa is talking about Bitcoin.  We are going to be huge.
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:49:42
Your a small percentage of the world.  Most do not have access to banking and most do not have access to fiat that is not collapsing everyday.  Bitcoin is the hives answer to the crumbling world, held by the hands of the few.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:19:18
haha, man everyday there are these guys.  I have to leave reddit soon.  Its just a place for easily manipulated people to make noises with their hands.
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:39:32
Ok, take this with a measure of salt, but I think it to be true.
First I think Bitcoin is being unwillingly hijacked because of 9 years of trust and decentralization.
 American and the 24 or so Central Banks hate it and so do the chineese, russians and so on, but they hate each other more. They need a trust-less system to move large amounts of money around and they are not going to trust the other to control it.  Everything from Arms money, Bribes, agents in the field, to also include shipping/trade and so much more.  If you are old enough you might remember the war in Iraq after 911.  We had to load up dozens of semi trucks with money so they could fill transport planes (plural) with cash to take to Iraq.  Where did all the money go you ask?  haha  Who the fuck knows! The next war, as long as it doesn't come to soon, we will be using a cashless, digital system to hand out relief and paying our local bribes with it.  
Now for the Extremely Rich and illegal Cartels, I sometimes have a hard time differentiating.
There is 21 trillion sitting in offshore accounts.  In the last leak we found out the Queen of England had some money in these accounts.  Maybe she is worried about being overthrown! ha  Look into how hard it is to get your money unnoticed into an offshore account.  She had to use her multiple companies and banks to filter it to a place that she is not even sure if she should trust with her money, but she has so much so Im sure she has 50 different places she stores wealth.  Now imagine if these people could have their wealth on a trezor.  haha   They want Bitcoin too.
None of the 2 groups I just mentioned care if it costs $30 to send 30 million in 30 minutes.
The reason I think Bitcoin over Eth other than years and security are a few things. 
First *Ethereum Executes Blockchain Hard Fork to Return DAO Funds* Jul 20, 2016
*The achievement, which returns approximately $40m worth of ether from an account owned by an unknown hacker to a new address, is being met with celebration by many members of the ethereum community. However, the actual implications of the decision, which essentially showed that a supposedly immutable blockchain history can be altered, is yet to be seen.*
Scarcity of Bitcoin Gives it Value.  Sure It might sound like a gimmick now because some have copied it, but It gives it a huge edge.  My favorite guy in this community is Ronnie Moes.  If you do not know him, check him out.  Hes awesome and incredibly smart.  When Ronnie speaks, shit jumps!  He is one of wallstreets top pickers and been great on my pocketbook when it comes to crypto.  He thinks bitcoin is going to zero or to a million, or there abouts.  He was quoted saying to cnbc "I don't know how much gold there is in the ground, but I know how much bitcoin there is, and in two years there will be 300 million people in the world trying to get their hands on a few million bitcoin."  
Sorry long rant, but I think some of this gets lost in the reddit community, who continuously shills the next coin.
Its nice to see a reasonable conversation here sometimes, thanks

Haha. I do this.  I will get to the point of pulling the trigger on a sale and I will say "Boom" outloud.  Then I will watch the price for another minute.  I am almost always wrong at choosing the right moment to sell, so I quite selling.

I closed my laptop, put it on the shelf and thought I would wait a week.  Found myself installing binance on tablet an hour later.  I justify this by telling myself that I won't use it to trade, just look everyonce in a while
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:56:25
9 years and we are already in the top 90% of currencies in the world.  No fucking way anyone thought it would movethis quick.  Let alone the onramps to highway have been backed up for months.  Money cant get in!
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:28:04
Doesn't have to replace fiat.  Just like there is room for all other currencies in the world, there is room for bitcoin.  Ronnie Moas believes its going to 100k in the next few years.  This is based on the idea that there is over 200 trillion dollars in investments.  He thinks that 2% of that goes to bitcoin.  I see no reason why not to think that also.  Look up Ronnie if you do not know him, he rarely gets it wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:55:43
I didn't think I would like it at first, but wow, I was wrong.  First I said Bitcoin and they all jumped on board.  The I said US issued government bonds and fuck, they were impressed.  Then I said General Electric and I was on fire.  Boom, here we are today and Bitcoin is my only disappointment.  It just wont fricken die!  Shit
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:11:17
Go back and see how many were waiting for 5k back in Nov.  Ive learned to just walk away.  If you are trading or selling frequently, you will end up with less bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:25:52
*Bitcoin core walked out tomorrow*
if you were talking about any of the many cryptos I might agree.  Core isnt just a couple of people. Also MIT Digital Currency Initiative funds some of the development of Bitcoin Core.  Core will keep growing and changing over time.
This is going to sound like a dick, but Im not trying too.  I have a decent amount of money into bitcoin, more than  the 90% here I would guess.  Your comparison to Myspace fails when it comes to money.  I do not need 5 seconds transactions, do not need to buy a cup of coffee on the other side of the world for a $1 and sometimes people who are using Bitcoin need to move large sums.  I will not trust my money to a coin that has been around for 6 months and is more centralized.  I need to feel reassured that my money will get there and the transaction has been confirmed as authentic.  9 years solid, reliable and hardened by all critics, it stands true. 
I own too many other coins, but at the end of the day.  If the shit hits the fan, Im running back to Bitcoin.  Just like recently.  Yes bitcoin took a hit, like all others, but I had problems sleeping at night sometimes because I thought maybe I should regroup back to Bitcoin.  I should of too, I lost a lot of coins I was speculating on, but fuck , its crypto.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:26:45
Haha,  a lot of us are here solely for the idea of being decentralized.  I will not crash with this ship called fiat if I have a choice.  Bitcoin is my choice.
Bitcoin is not overvalued.  This is a pool that needs to fill to be stable.  Instead of filling the pool with a garden hose, which is stable and slow.  Bitcoin is filling it with a geyser and its splashing around like a motha fucker.  Soon, it will be nothing to send a few million/billion across this planet for a few bucks and nobody will notice.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:09:33
Your ok, I just think after about a week or two you will see that actually holding onto a few good sub 1 billion cap coins will net a lot more.  I day trade, but my best gains are all from things like SUB, DRG, REQ and so on.   Realize that these are emerging companies and tech, so when the market starts to move down, these sometimes go down further because they are more niche, but on the way up, they are great.    Good luck

Buffets right all the time.  Just like when he thought that automobile technology was ok, but he liked the idea of wheels on the horse instead of the new fangled cars. Or when he said " Just fap to magazines, this internet thing is just a craze"!

Fuck Buffet!  If left to guys like buffet there would be no internet to have this stupid conversation.  I hate the fact that we look to people like Buffet as some great profit. Buffet likes money more than people, he wont hesitate to own shares in monsanto but he hesitates when it comes to things that will benefit humanity.

@_date: 2018-01-18 09:33:45
Why would the banks/financial institutions/World Governments want to prop up Bitcoin right now?  They need to accumulate to play in the next game and its hard.  At any given moment there are very little bitcoins available to purchase in large quantities. So keep the people ignorant until they have enough, or all!

I think everyone should give Dan some love after that.

We have a voice on CNBC.  I know we might, or at least I do not care much for cnbc because of people like Jim Cramer, but I appreciate some of the direction they have taken with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:04:27
Man, this is like the 3rd or 4th time this has happened in 3 months alone.  
The one thing that nobody is talking about is the alternatives to a world without Bitcoin.  A day of reckoning is upon us.  The world is 220 trillion dollars in debt and growing.  You are in a time of quantitative easing and you just do not know it.  Like a frog in slowly boiling water.  Your children will be controlled and the freedom you once enjoy eroded until its unrecognizable.  
Bitcoin is the shelf the world needs to hold their valuables until the little boys and their toys are told that we decided not to play.

@_date: 2017-12-13 05:16:59
I agree totally.  Such a small number of people involved across the world!  I never heard someone say the gigantic growth of amazon was bad, or better yet, the adoption rate of internet use is to fast.   We are moving at a rate of 100 years every ten years in technological achievements and it is only increasing.  Speculation that we will progress 20,000 years for every 10 the second we get A.I.  If one ponders the future, its hard to believe bitcoin isnt the one leading it.  Also bitcoin has to be valued so high in the future to facilitate large movements of money.  It only makes sense.
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:54:43
First you have to focus in decentralized, big deal.  
Now for to slow, its still faster than any current system in the world to send money to someone on the other side of the world and still cheaper by the way.  Ive paid $75 to send 20k by wire transfer to another state and it took 24 hours. Ive sent a 100k of bitcoin across the sea in 10 minutes for a cost of $7, so much better.  Also no banks involved, right to the person.
As far as for people who dont have much and the fees are to high.  One a solution is coming soon that will remedy it, but if you are in Venezuela, your money is losing its value so quickly I dont know if you care or not.
 You have to step back and say wow, bitcoin is being hit by the media, financial institutions, governments, hackers, spamming transactions and so on and its still standing.  If it was any other entity, it would have been done a longtime ago.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:45:06
Why do i feel like wherever there is one of these hit pieces the only people that come to the bitcoin sub to complain are Bcash people.  Ive yet to see an intelligent argument on one of these issues from their side.  I get it, they hate bitcoin and want to tear it apart, but I cant believe that they dont realize that if they destroy bitcoin, Bcash goes first.

I went to every car dealer in the city and tried to sell them early websites and securing their .com names.  I sold 0.  I sold cars for years before this very successfully but could not sell a website to a dealer.  
I look at bitcoin and see the same thing.  Last time it made me sad  because I was to early to the party.  This time I feel good about it! ha
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:40:47
hah, ive been maxed out for 2 months.  Holding came easy
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:33:05
The exchanges are loaded with millions more each month, big business is jumping in and the news is all bitcoin.  If I was you and dont trust me, study it, but I would feel comfortable for a minimum of 6 months to year for guaranteed high returns.  I personally feel we hit a 100k this year and who the fuck knows next year.  If you invested at almost anytime this year, in 2 weeks you made more than anywhere else.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:21:07
In 5 or 10 years, every Corporation  will have a coin. Most people will keep their value in bitcoin and have 100s of other coins.  I can imagine companies using them as reward points and so on and you will have hundreds.  I think at that point you will be able to instantly transfer your 120 gas station coins, 30 movie theater coins and 10 amazon coins to the bartender which is automatically converted to whatever denomination they desire.  
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:46:48
I did and I really like coinbase and Gdax.  They work pretty flawlessly.  I just want my cash so I can leave for good.

Anybody dealing with Kraken should know they have more people working reddit than they have working in IT.  I cant even load their site half the time, I feel like a fool that I decided to deal with these people.
