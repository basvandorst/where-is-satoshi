And buy the dips!
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:36:43
You are right. My bad
@_date: 2018-05-15 13:34:49
I agree
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:46:07
Doing pretty good for the value of Bitcoin so far :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:45:33
No, btc is crashing hard
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:46:49
Safe bet? No. Best investment? Yes! Congrats and let's keep on going
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:48:12
Only a good sign if you ask me. The newbies need help, give it to them! :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:45:05
Everyone moving into alts
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:36:18
Buy alts. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:07:21
That's true!
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:47:32
Because it's so damn satisfying :D
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:58:39
This is GOLD!
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:35:51
Maybe in 5 years it will be in the dictionary.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:36:39
Well yea, maybe wait a bit and then buy! :p
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:57:52
Probably a combination of the headline, china and the upcoming fork. FOMO is real
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:31:56
Buy more! It's on a huge discount now! Everything will clear up after this FUD is over.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:55:58
You don't. HODL to the grave.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:33:28
Well, China is pretty nationalistic so i'd guess most of the China coins like Neo, Walton, Qtum etc
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:08:07
You're right, it still has to update but we went pas the 100B mark for sure haha
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:38:17
Where does it stop?!
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:05:01
I think we can easily see new ATH’s. That’s coming from someone that just sold all his Alts for Bitcoin though.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:42:47
Thats great! Congrats! You did a lot better than i did so far haha
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:39:54
Get Bitcoin to be relatively safe. Get some nice altcoins you believe in for a bigger risk big reward.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:50:02
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:48:21
Sure looks like it!
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:25:43
I think we will hit 7K before the SegWit2X fork but after that some of the value will be split to the S2X coin so i don’t think a single BTC will be over 7K for a while after that
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:50:45
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:54:39
That's the spirit!
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:04:00
You're right, my bad. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:55:15
Maybe the alts will increase more than the 2x coins will be worth though. That’s the question
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:05:07
Good point!
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:57:10
Talking about the S2X fork!
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:14:57
They hopefully have learned from this and don't sell that easy next time.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:26:20
Bitfinex does have nearly 10% of the volume though so the price is pretty average but you're right 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:27:34
That's true, but comparing his ROI to mine so far he did better.
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:55:46
We did it!!
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:45:42
Well, buying at an ATH is not a good plan most of the times.. i think buying alts with new money right before the fork is a smart move though
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:49:06
On Bitfinex!
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:14:36
Make it 50k ;)
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:22:35
No shit...
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:18:16
The majority if the miners still support it so no don’t think so
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:40:45
That's good. At this rate it'll be 100$ in about a year ;)
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:20:02
Maybe we've mooned but we can certainly go waaaay higher! haha
