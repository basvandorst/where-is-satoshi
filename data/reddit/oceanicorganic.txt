Sure, I'm not disputing that. It isn't the best example. I'm just frustrated with Stallman hate. 
Everyone loves poking fun at Stallman, but the guy has nothing but the world's best interests at heart. I think it is pretty clear at this point that he is on the autism spectrum somewhere, diagnosed or not. Naturally that means he will be more persistent about things and... well, just very weird sometimes.

I mean. Imagine you spend a lot of time working on an invention. It is a homemade electric car kit called GOAT. You choose to give the instructions away for the good of society. But you don't have a power source, and battery science is not your strong suit. 
So a guy named Luukas Toivonen invents a power core for it. He calls it the 'Luunix'. 
Toivonen then packages the instructions for building the Luunix  with the instructions to build a GOAT. It becomes extremely popular...
But everyone is talking about driving their Luunix. 
Shit! 
.. and when you ask for credit for your life's work that you gave away for free... everyone laughs at you, and makes fun of you for eating yummy foot mushrooms at a conference.

I thought of that too! As it turns out, Satoshi is a very common Japanese given name meaning "wise" or "clear/quick-thinking". 
Both of Satoshi's names are extremely common-- his equivalent name in English might be "John Smith". This actually is one of the many suggestions that there has never actually been a real "Satoshi Nakamoto" and that it is just a pseudonym.

Short answer: you don't.  
Long answer: Bitcoin does not support transaction reversal; it is the digital form of cash money. The payment processors are currently very rudimentary and work mostly as a direct gateway to the bare protocol. In the future, for Bitcoin to succeed, someone will have to do for Bitcoin what credit cards did for cash-- that is, among other things, centralise the risk of handling fraud in return for a per-transaction fee.
If you begin taking Bitcoin right now using Coinbase or BitPay, it will be almost exactly like accepting cash. It will be up to the ethical integrity of your operation to decide the fate of refund requests.

I vaguely recall reading one of the arguments for it being a pseudonym: that the name "Nakamoto Satoshi" would be a pretty common, boring name in Japanese, something like  "John Smith" for Anglophones. That may be the reason he changed it, too.

Your proposed system confounds my eyes. That is not to say it is inferior, I am only providing hopefully useful feedback.
Personally, I believe that we should all be using microbitcoins-- that leaves only the usual two decimal spaces. It also works psychologically with the current valuation, if you think less 'dollars' and more 'yen'. 
We could call these units 'micros' for short... 'microbits', perhaps, or 'mikes'. 'mils' or 'mill' could work for the thousand, then after that a 'coin', any amount higher than a few dozen of those is interesting enough to talk about in long form.

Better build your own compiler from scratch, too:
Seriously. If you are a revolutionary in need of that much protection from the prying eyes of the government, you really have no other choice than to build your own computer (from scratch, not parts) and write your own operating system, up until the point where you have a viable C compiler. Then I guess you can go back to triple-checking every line of every program you compile and use.

Thanks for the explanation. I'm still a little lost though. When I was new to Bitcoin, the idea of an "address" was immediately intuitive.
As the technology developed, a clear argument surfaced for only using a given address once. Cool. However, many people continue to use the same address repeatedly with no consequences, because the detriments do not apply to them. But let's assume everyone should absolutely not be re-using Bitcoin addresses...
So you were saying, we should stop using the terminology "address" because it is misleading. I just think that isn't true-- especially when you have a look at Bitcoin's audience which is still mostly programmers (I think).
Firstly, you don't use someone's bitcoin address to receive money from them. You use someone's bitcoin address to send money to them, and if you're doing Bitcoin correctly, once you generate an address and it's out there, you never delete the private key, because what if you or someone else accidentally sends to that address?
Secondly, this isn't the first time "addresses" have been transient. Not by a long shot. Memory addresses come to mind-- extremely transient.
Sure you can say there are no "bitcoins" either as another poster mentioned and I get what you're saying, I do, and it has some technical validity, it does, but it is just more confusing your way, not the other way around. This is what we've always called these things as long as we've been Bitcoiners.

People generally say, "THIS IS GENTLEMEN." when bullish news is announced.
It basically now means literally the same thing as "To the moon!", but more in reaction to news than simply market movement. They cross over a lot, but for example, if the trend is violently upward you would probably see more "To the moon!". If some nation announces more restrictive capital controls (thus potentially inviting flight to Bitcoin)... that is typically "gentlemen".
Edit to add:  in my experience "gentlemen" also seems, on average, to be a bit more about organic acceptance of Bitcoin and growth of the actual economy/ecosystem. Whereas "HODL" and "To the moon!" are typically raw hype about how we are all going to be fucking rich.
Except those of us who got goxxed.

I am tired but not so tired as so I will explain. Briefly.
Someone a while ago posted some fairly bullish news with "THIS IS IT, GENTLEMEN." appended to the title. Only they were so excited that they left out the " IT," part.... and "THIS IS GENTLEMEN." was born.
It became another rallying cry, joining the likes of HODL and "To the moon!".
It is relatively unrelated to the whole " artistic omission" trend (accidentally a whole pizza, for example). It may have enjoyed some secondary popularity due to that though.

Language does change over time but there is a difference between gradual change and just being wrong. There is a defined scholarly meaning to the phrase, and the use of "begs" where one means "raises" is a result of unnecessary ignorance because our society is too lazy/apathetic to read about that meaning.
If I and my entire region suddenly started calling bonfires "bomb fires", or the Grand Canyon the "Graham Canyon", it would not be a part of our local "dialect" simply because we didn't know the correct words and their etymologies; it would be wrong. 
For the same reason I think it is an extremely ridiculous idea to allow children to do their school assignments in jive (or Ebonics or AAE or whatever the PC term is this decade). It isn't a dialect; it is a bastardisation. Those kids will learn the hard way that they will never advance in society while representing themselves as an uneducated moron.

Stealing? No. When you steal something, it isn't still there for someone else to buy or steal.


False. This site couldn't last forever. Piracy will continue to exist, because sale of a conditional "licence" to certain intellectual property is an outdated and simply impossible business model in a world where it is simply so easy to duplicate and proliferate data.


Torrents can be used for legal items. And before you pull the "technicality" card, technicalities are an important part of the legal framework which protects a free society.


This is an interesting one. Firstly morality has no place in the law. So there is that. Also, we can feel that certain laws, while they do exist, are valid. 
For example gay people serving in the military was illegal for some time, however when anyone would get caught there was a large movement which definitely thought it was a shame. This is a similar occurrence. I believe this is a shame.


The keyword here is reasonable. That is subjectively defined, and most of us find this and other similar laws unreasonable.

The effect on the victim. In one case, the victim's loss is in the form of property. In the other, it is in the form of theoretical opportunity cost.

Semantic horseshit is my specialty.
However, it isn't just semantics. Theft and copyright infringement have two entirely different effects on the victim.
In the case of theft, the item is gone.
In the case of copyright infringement, it is not. It will be duplicated and rented, sold, or licensed an untold number of times in the future. 
Compare: you are creating a game. I steal your hard drive (theft). I am also, in effect, stealing the game's source code (theft).
Versus: you are creating a game. I break into your house (burglary/B&amp;E), copy your hard drive (unauthorised access), and distribute the unfinished game's source code on the Internet (copyright infringement). You still have the code though; so no actual theft was perpetrated, though more laws were actually broken.
You say or at least imply they are the same, by focusing on the "taking without paying" aspect, but they affect the wronged party in different ways.

Bitcoins themselves would 'survive' as long as a copy (physical, mental, or algorithmic) of their private keys remained. 
The network, however, is another point. Indeed, addresses could be generated and even transactions signed offline, but how would they make it to the blockchain, and in a timely enough manner to avoid double spends? That is a problem we need to work on before Patient Zero is infected.

Which client are you using? I'm a fan of Mycelium, which certainly allows and encourages backups. I used to use BitcoinSpinner, which I believe is deprecated but also encourages and allows backups.
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:24:21
In order to understand paper wallets, you must first understand how bitcoins are stored. As with everything that looks "real" on a computer-- music, videos, and pictures for example-- bitcoins are stored as numbers. You can do cool mathy stuff with these numbers so that other people can send you coins, but they can't spend the ones you already have. 
At no point should *anyone* else *ever* know the *actual* numbers-- or else they could do the cool mathy stuff that allows you to *spend* coins-- and you'll lose them all.
Internet-connected computers, especially those running popular operating systems with known security holes, are obviously no place for these very very secret numbers-- so people with non-negligible sums of bitcoins are advised to generate the numbers once, write them down (or print them out), and keep this "**paper wallet**" in a safe, secure location. As long as no person (or program) was able to see or manipulate those numbers when you generated them, your bitcoins are now as safe as they could ever be... so long as you never, ever lose that wallet!
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:03:32
I'm unfamiliar with how to do a backup in Shildbach's client, but I'm sure there's a way.
Mycelium Wallet's pretty neat; I like it a lot and it's very convenient. It works for me and the friends I've introduced, and an obscure vulnerability involving the way Android generates random numbers was recently closed on it a few months ago. I don't have any experience with your client so it's unfair to pass judgement.
Anyway, in Mycelium if you choose that route, it's as simple as hitting the menu button, going to "key management", long-pressing the address, and selecting Export. The private key produced is very precious-- anyone with access to it can spend your future coins, so be very careful with it! Treat it like you would treat your dirtiest, most foul secret-- only even more carefully.

Down the rabbit hole we go.
A Bitcoin transaction requires two things: an input or inputs, and an output or outputs. 
Inputs are other transactions. Not necessarily addresses or any particular amount of "coins". So basically, if you only ever send *one* transaction to the paper wallet, you only ever have *one* input to use. Here's where it gets interesting.
You may have heard of transaction fees-- they're coins given back to the miners as a "thank you" (or, more frankly, as a bribe to mine your transaction). Fees aren't an output-- fees are the lack of output. Basically, if you put coins into a transaction that you don't send to another address, they get gobbled up as mining fees. Folks who don't understand this have lost crazy sums of coins this way, just not understanding the protocol.
So it is technically true that you've got to spend it all. The question is, to whom?
Nothing stops you from spending it back to yourself. As a matter of fact, although many people may complain, you can even spend it back to the same paper wallet. So as long as you know what you are doing, you can easily take a small amount out of a paper wallet, or any other wallet for that matter.

Well technically you *can* send the blockchain... but there are plenty of places they could find it themselves...  lol
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:00:29
Sure, I can try.
When you move your 100 BTC (congratulations! wish I had a tenth of that), what you are doing is "signing" a transaction. That's one of the cool mathy things (and probably the most important) which you can do with that secret number we talked about. "Signing" it means you are mathematically proving that you authorised the transaction. Only someone with the **secret number** can do that. After you sign it, you send it to the network, and at some point a miner includes it in a block while building the blockchain.
The blockchain holds a record of all money ever sent and received by every bitcoin address *ever*. What it *doesn't* have is your **private key** (that is what we call that secret number!), and your real-life identity. This is why so many people get so angry when people call Bitcoin "anonymous". Bitcoin is pseudonymous-- your pseudonym(ae) or "pen name(s)" is/are your Bitcoin address(es). If anyone ever links a person's name to an address they've used before... well, it's basically like they faxed their credit card statement to the entire world. :)

The problem with MtGox is that they've had some bank accounts seized and weird stuff happen, so essentially there is now a months-long delay for any sort of US currency withdrawal from them. It's still really easy to get bitcoins in and out though, so what people do is, they mostly trade up and down on MtGox and then buy bitcoins when they want to get their American money out.
This, in turn, drives the price up much higher than the other exchanges and creates a "new" unit of account some people have taken to calling "gox-bucks". The gox-bucks are valued lower than the actual U.S. dollar, because of the risk involved in tying up your money in bank transfers for months. 
You could theoretically "make money" by buying on a lower exchange, transferring the bitcoins to MtGox, and selling there. But it's going to take months to get your money... and what if Gox suddenly goes belly-up? Then you're screwed.

There is an app I suggest called Authy for two factor. It keeps an encrypted backup of your keys if you wish, so that if your phone is stolen, your keys are 'safe' (but no longer 'secure', so you will have to change them). You may consider moving to that app when this is over.

It's possible to make money doing that-- but it's easier to lose money, because of the fees involved with each trade. There's a certain price gap between when you make your initial move and when you liquidate where you're just handing your money to the exchange.
Also, even if you found an exchange with zero fees, there's the insane volatility to worry about. The fact is that no matter how much you try to time or read the market, there is always going to be someone who is making their decision based on what they think yours will be. This kind of dynamic behaviour ensures that nobody can really know what the price is going to be tomorrow, much less the next few months.
If you want to "make money" with BTC, it's as easy as providing a good or service in exchange for it. If you already have a job which pays in U.S. Dollars (or other fiat currency), consider dollar-cost averaging.

Well, it doesn't look like they're completely dead-- I honestly haven't been paying much attention to BitInstant although they were my first buy.
You might try giving their support a shot. If you can recall any information about the transaction they may be able to look you up.
Check any and all e-mail addresses you have for an e-mail, look way back. Try to remember if you have ever started a MtGox account or similar.
Search any computer you may have used for a file called "wallet.dat". If you purchased bitcoins that long ago, there's a serious possibility you were running the client on your PC, since there were not many user-friendly choices back then.
Basically there are three things you may have done with the coins that I can think of:
1. kept them on your PC
2. received an e-mail link to redeem them, or
3. used some online wallet or exchange.
Depending on BitInstant's implementation of the e-mail thing, either 66% or 100% of those choices would not be within BitInstant's reach to solve.
If you stored your coins anywhere online, you may be out of luck. A lot of online wallet services have come and gone, taking their users' coins with them.
