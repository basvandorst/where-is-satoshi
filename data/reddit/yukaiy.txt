How will the Chinese build their closed-source product from his source code if he doesn't make it open source?

The argument is she mishandled classified information by running it through an improperly secured home server. If a non-politician had been caught doing this it would likely have resulted in charges.

SHUT IT DOWN!!!
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:40:59
That is concerning :P
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:36:09
Yeah, and they only shut down the "non-essential" parts of the government. Why do we have "non-essential" parts of the government?

When an event occurs sometimes trade volume will spike on a cryptocurrency. It doesn't mean it will stay that way necessarily (doesn't mean it won't either though). Ethereum has been there before.

I just checked out Long Url Maker website and its hilarious.

It is merged-mined with Bitcoin now. So yes it is still around but no longer can be directly mined.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:18:09
I feel a lot of people might get hurt on this one. I hope it doesn't hurt the overall community when all is said and done. On the other hand, perhaps BCH will do well in the long run. Bitcoin XT with 8MB blocks did not do well but we hadn't hit the bottleneck when they forked that one.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:01:40
Short term movements are common. The price will definitely take a hit right before and certainly right after Coinbase releases their customers BCH into the wild. What the price at that time looks like I do not know but expect it to dip around the week of the 1st of January for sure.

I'd wager a lot of them are scams but anything new is going to have a lot of scams.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:30:19
This sort of thing happens constantly.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:56:35
Not to be rude but I think these guys must be fairly new or just shilling if they thing anything under 25% up or down is a major movement.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:17:22
I get the feeling a lot of these people are rallied on ideological terms. I think they feel that the banks or some other "force" are trying to kill Bitcoin by not allowing it to scale. As ridiculous as that is that is the mindset of some people.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:12:27
Wasn't Bitshares working on this problem?
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:07:18
Lots of altcoins in the sea. BCH has the feel of a classic pump and dump so I'm pretty hesitant to take it too seriously. Time will tell.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:39:09
LTC is a great altcoin. I've always liked Scrypt coins.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:28:24
Wow, thank you. Did not know that existed.

This is probably true. Bitcoin has huge potential as a store of value. Its weightless gold. That is gonna be appealing and Bitcoin has the first mover advantage. It could go to $20,000 in my opinion.

Don't invade Russia in the winter and don't short Bitcoin are two things that have held true in the past but may not always.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:54:48
Coinbase won't even release the BCH they are holding for users until January 1st, 2018. That is a significant amount of BCH sitting at Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:31:03
Bitcoin XT called from 2015 and it wants its block size increase back :P
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:07:13
Good points. I agree ensuring confidence in cryptocurrency and Bitcoin as a decentralized store of value is far more important than replacing Visa at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:37:58
No lol this is business as usual for cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:56:52
Your BCH will be available in your Coinbase account on January 1st, 2018 providing the Bitcoin was in your account on August 1st 2017 when the fork happened. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:10:07
Good question.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:03:27
Ahh, Ethereum yes, also remember Bitcoin XT with its 8MB blocks?

I just paid $0.41 and it was pretty quick. Estimated 4 hours, got into a block in less than 30 minutes.

If you are familiar with Scrypt-based coin mining you'd see that this is very common to switch coins. A new cryptocurrency is usually really profitable to mine, then on and off profitable, eventually settling into being unprofitable and it dies.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:55:40


A Bitcoin fork created Bitcoin Cash a competing cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is becoming popular and transaction fees are up so some people are jumping ship for Bitcoin Cash which has bigger blocks. Bitcoin is fine, here is a list of other Bitcoin forks:

I'm not abandoning a safer hedge because some blog called me a coward. Get real. Nice advertising for your blog though :P

Good point. There is more a nation state does for its currency than simply back it with force. A military on its own does little for a currency, look at North Korea with one of the largest standing armies. Economic strength and fiscal policy probably counts more than military for a currency.

It is amazing how these things seem so organic in cryptocurrency but then later you find out someone was stirring the pot for personal gains. It is sad some newbs are gonna get burned on this one.

I am surprised to see no discussion of Bitcoin XT. Bitcoin XT was to support 8MB blocks and forked from Bitcoin in 2015.

eBay also introduced crack to the inner cities.

Yeah, can't dwell on stuff like this. We all wish we had known but it was so risky I'm glad I have what little I do.
