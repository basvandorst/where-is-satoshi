Ok this makes no sense. All ive heard for months is how lightening network is going to fix bitcoin and make it usable again. If this is true and lightening is here then why isnt the whole front page covered with posts about it ?

Well for the past few years bitcoin was valuable to me because I needed it to buy drugs off the dark net and to gamble online with but now I can do all that stuff with other coins that are almost free to transact with.
Right now the only thing Bitcoin is useful to me for is on exchanges when I have to convert one alt coin to bitcoin to trade for another altcoin.
I would say that before long exchanges will start shifting over to a different coin as a main trading coin due to fees and the over all non functioning state of the bitcoin network.
I could care less about the value of bitcoin, I liked it much better when it was worth 400$ and I could use it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:50:36
I used bitcoin for years vefore it broke with no problems. Me and lots of folks care about the fees and speed. I mean i care to the point i completely quit using it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:15:31
I was happy using it as a currency for the past few years. Seeing as how i am not an investor that kind of makes it useless and broken to me. If that makes any sense?
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:45:02
This is true !!! All of us folks who have actually used Bitcoin for years have quit using it for everything we possibly can and have moved on to what ever alt coin people are accepting. 
Bitcoin just doesn't work anymore and folks who really use crypto currency know this is fact. 
It was a bit difficult at first but now it's easy to avoid using bitcoin altogether because all of the vendors who used to take BTC have started accepting at least one other alt coin.
At first I wanted Bitcoin to get fixed but now I could really care less because I can just use any of the many available options that work better, faster, and cheaper than bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:03:55
I used to use nitro and betcoin but I'm not sure if they are still up.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:27:31
So let me get this straight. It is cheap and fast and fixes everything but no one wants to use it ?
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:52:12
Theres a big difference between prostitution and crypto currency. Pussy will always be useful and hold value. If the government were to ban all the avenues that convert crypto into real dollars then it will become worthless.
The government cant stop you from owning crypto but they can stop legit businesses from accepting it and they can very easily stop it from being converted into fiat.
There is notbing the government can do to pussy to make it less valuable.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:04:29
Thats something people started saying when the fees got so high we couldn't actually use bitcoin as a currency any longer. The practical folks who needed to use a crypto moved on to litecoin or monero or basically anything besides bitcoin and all the investors started saying, well bitcoin isnt a currency its a store of value.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:10:34
BTC has been the back bone for a long time and now it has became unusable and everyone who actually uses crypto currency is going out of there way to avoid using bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:53:32
It used to work as a currency. It is now unusable.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:44:23
You can ship 70 pounds of gold for 7$ flat rate USPS , lol, just saying
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:01:20
Its laughable is what it is. Some folks are going to defend bitcoin no matter what happens, no matter how expensive fees get, no matter how slow. These are the people who decided bitcoin was never supposed to be a currency and started calling it a store of value when the fees got out if control.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:37:29
Less than a year ago you could send with a red of 1 or 2 pennies easily. That's why bitcoin picked up so much steel on the work online sites. You could send a dollar for a penny of two at the most. This hasn't been that long ago.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:17:50
Using coinbase to buy from the dark net or to buy gray area things like research chemicals or kratom can get you banned and using gambling sites will also do it.

Thats funny, as someone who used to use bitcoin to buy drugs with online i hate to tell you that its no longer affordable to do so. See you have to move your coins at least twice to buy anything and the fees and waiting time have made bitcoin useless for buying dope now a days.
Visit the dark net markets sub, everyone is moving on to different crypto currencies we can afford to use.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:36:28
So us folks that have been using it for years have had it wrong the entire time?????
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:20:54
They lost 1150$ of mine once back when they first implemented the instant PayPal transfer. After two weeks if back n forth their support told me there was nothing more they could do. They told me it was a cost of doing business and there was always risk.
Then I came to Reddit and complained and eventually I got help and got my money back. This took almost a month and if I didn't come here and out them on Reddit I'd have been screwed as there normal customer service closed my ticket as well as any new ones I made.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:00:58
you could be right and ill be the first one to admit that i know nothing about international anything as i have no use to transfer anything outside of the USA

Bitcoin isn't usable for normal folks right now. Currently it is only for investors. It's funny how literally every other crypto coin actually works and can be used yet Bitcoin is the most valuable.

Are you saying you tried to send Bitcoin to an electrum address or you tried to convert bitcoin to electrum via an exchange?  I am somewhat confused.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:00:41
If segwit is so good then why are fees still so high and TXs so slow?????
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:24:04
I'm not familiar with that wallet. You want to use a wallet that gives you a choice to set a custom fee. Then use that link provided to you below by the other comnenter to see what fee you need. You will then set your fee at so many Satoshi per byte.
Remember that your fees are not determined by the amount of coin you send it's determined by the size of your tx. Depending on what your balance was made up from tx size can vary greatly from one TX to the next. 
It gets easier to figure out eventually but right now it's not really affordable to try and use Bitcoin for buying stuff. If you can use litecoin, monero, or BCH then you'll save a ton of money and time.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:07:09
Anytime you are choosing a wallet for any crypto you need to come to Reddit and search for reviews on it. There is a link in the side bar with several good choices to use.
Personally I use electrum on my desktop and on my Android tablet I use mycelium for Bitcoin and I use coinomi for altcoins . More recently I did download green address wallet because it is supposed to be faster due to segwit.
I guess the point is that all of these wallets are tested and recommended by others from communities like this one. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:11:37
yeah but it just sucks that the change means using something completely different. it just sucks that the people who have actually used bitcoin for years have to abandon it for something completely different
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:25:59
Yeah Ltc would be great, anything fast and cheap to move that's reliable would work.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:55:12
I am not an investor and never have been. I've had lots of btc over the years that I used as currency . Right now I have no use for any crypto currency that's not economical to use. I'm not an investor just a guy who works online and used to take his pay in bitcoin before everything changed.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:43:39
We'll see way back in the day a lot of us used Bitcoin. That was a thing at one time.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:47:07
bitcoin used to be a currency but it isnt anymore
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:57:42
It sounds like part of your balance isn't confirmed yet
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:00:19
Well you'd still see the tx and know the wallet worked even if it didn't confirm. You can still send a few cents with custom fee of your choosing. You'll see it in your wallet unconfirmed
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:36:33
Yeah it sucked, to be very honest coinbase is horrible to deal with. You'll learn that eventually because it's not a problem until you have a problem. People tell everyone not to store coin on there for good reason.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:13:51
Go over to the dark net markets sub Reddit or the research chems sub. All of us have used BTC for years. We're not investors and it sucks that now we can't use it anymore. It was nice while it lasted I just wish all the vendors and market places would pick a new currency to start using.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:06:33
I use green address wallet which I switched to because someone was going on about how much better it was because of segwit and so far I noticed no change. Fees are still crazy high and TXs are horribly slow.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:26:11
You could buy coffee with BCH and not have to spend the night at the coffee shop waiting for the TX to confirm. You'd also not have to pay more in fees than the coffee cost.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:10:33
Your welcome I hope it helps
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:15:51
Uhh what do you think? It would lock the fuck up so fast no one could use it. Be realistic, a very tiny portion of the world uses Bitcoin right now and Everytime the price moves the blockchain lags and txs get stuck then fees go to the moon.
So just imagine how that would work if the world started using it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:12:22
People can only tell you what is fastest and cheapest right now. No one knows what the future will bring for any of these coins. I mean I remember when they told me that segwit was going to fix the problem with Bitcoin being unusable. People said that for a good while and it was pure speculation and not even remotely true.
The question your asking is really impossible to answer with any degree of certainty
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:36:02
I used to use Bitcoin every single day but as many others have done lately I to have stopped using Bitcoin altogether. What Bitcoin I have just sits and any incoming payments I have in btc go directly to an exchange and are transferred to either litecoin or BCH so I can actually spend them.  I have almost successfully switched all of my crypto activity over to something besides Bitcoin due to the extremely high cost.
I don't see how Bitcoin can continue to be this great store of value when the folks who actually used to spend it are abandoning it for any of the better options available.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:59:01
What wallet are you using? Can you set a custom fee?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:39:20
BTC is failing as anything except something investors are day trading and holding trying to get rich. You can't use it like you used to be able to before the price hikes. I liked it better when it was worth 500$
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:44:02
I've used it as a seller
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:24:32
Ok then try doing it with a custom fee. 
@_date: 2018-10-28 08:13:34
Or just pick one from the ones posted in the link in the side bar. 
@_date: 2018-10-28 02:52:06
I used to use bitcoin almost daily but that was when it stayed around 500-700$ range. Once it started raising in value it became cheaper to just use PayPal.  I make most of my living online and a lot of my employers will pay me extra if I take crypto so that got me into it. 
Plus when I began using bitcoin you could send about any size tx for a penny or two at the most. That was what I liked about it the most back then. 
I still accept part of my pay in crypto but the only time I take bitcoin is if I’m planning on buying something that either requires bitcoin specifically or offers me a good discount for using it.  But that is not very often now a days because all the places that used to give bitcoin discounts or require it now want BCH or LTC instead. I mean they will still take bitcoin but they rarely give a discount and sone even charge a bit more because of fees. Or at least this was the case when I quit using bitcoin so often. 
I love crypto currency but I’m no investor. I’m one of the ones who actually used bitcoin so I guess I see it differently than the folks who view it as an investment. 
I know one thing, I most definitely don’t want to wake up tomorrow and find I can’t load my BitPay card because the value of bitcoin rose and it costs 20$ to send 20$ again. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:51:43
The OP is talking about right now is why I asked. I can't see telling anyone to set a fee of 50 sat per byte this moment. Personally I'm just not using any of the coin I have until everything calms down. I just can't afford it with the current fees needed to make something confirm
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:29:14
I use different wallets for different things. I have incoming money from several different places and I have reasons to keep things separate. It doesn't cost me any extra because it isn't like I'm sending coin from one wallet to another. I just give my employer or customer the address of the wallet I want the coin sent to.
I only have to pay a fee when I decide to spend my coin or move it.
Yes there are most definitely fees any and every time you send crypto coins from one wallet to another. Right now Bitcoin fees are higher than they have ever been.
Starting out you will not have a need for more than one wallet. But it doesn't hurt to download a couple and see what you like best.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:29:24
You send the amount in btc that bitpay tells you to send. You do not send it by dollar amount from your wallet because it will not be enough. Bitpay always charges a bit more.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:18:02
I used it for a year and a half everyday as I work online and am able to take as much of my pay in coin as I please. I loved it up until a few months back. It isn't practical to actually use day to day anymore. I mean there are days when it costs a fortune to send a few bucks so it just doesn't work well for that stuff any longer.
Boy it sure used to.
Now I only take enough coin to gamble a bit with or buy shit off the markets if the mood strikes me
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:35:36
You need to enter the exact amount of btc that any btc payment processor tells you to . You can't just use a dollar amount or figure it yourself because I've never once had a payment processor value BTC the same as my wallet did.
Your going to have to message support on that site and see what's going on. I am not sure what processors do when you do not send enough coin but I'm sure it wouldn't allow it to complete.
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:27:52
I use coinomi for all coin other than Bitcoin and I like it very well. For Bitcoin I mainly use mycelium and electrum but I also have a blockchain wallet I use now n then. I have a good friend and she uses bread wallet and recommends it all the time to folks but I've never personally used it.

Bitpay is completely unusable at the moment. I've got a couple hundred bucks I was wanting to just get cashed out and for some reason all of a sudden bitpay is almost charging double to cash out Bitcoin. At least it was about 9 am eastern time this morning.
Over the years bitpay has always had a small difference in btc they require for a cash load from the actual value. Generally it is like 1 to 2$ but today it was almost double.
Not to mention the recent emails they been sending do not sound reassuring at all.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:47:23
Fees are insanely high right now . Maybe you can get into the accelerator but I don't know if that is working right now or not. Google via btc accelerator. Then enter your text I'd and type the captcha. You may have to wait till the top of the hour.

Electrum, blockchain, and mycelium are all great wallets. I prefer mycelium for Bitcoin . I also use a coinomi wallet but I use that for any alt coins I have which is very little but over the years I've had employers tip me with all kinds of odd crypto currency that I've never heard of and that I store in coinomi

go over to reddit beermoney, find one of the sites from the stickied thread that pay in bitcoin. you wont get rich but you can earn bitcoin doing tasks and offers in your spare time. then you just have to make a free wallet and learn how to use it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:32:23
No shit, I wasn't trying to. You asked about suggestions on what wallets to use and I figured I'd let you know which ones work well for me.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:21:50
You say as more people use Bitcoin it will get cheaper. I'm sorry to tell you that is not how it has worked so far. Until this recent price hikes Bitcoin has been the cheapest way to transfer money online. But with all this hype around the high value now Everytime the price jumps or dips the fees skyrocket and the chain slows to a crawl.
I'm sorry to say this but anyone who has actually been using Bitcoin for currency the past few years can tell you that as more people have began to use it recently problems have started to occur.
It is working the exact opposite of what your saying it does, I'm sorry but I've experienced it for the past few months Everytime the value adjusts. I know it was absolutely great when it was worth 500$ a coin. Low fees and fast confirmations
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:57:18
I don't know anything at all about bch. I mean I have some of it from the fork but I've never done anything with it yet. But let me ask you this, can this new bch coin continue to have cheap fees and fast transactions if the price raises really fast and it becomes popular and gets huge amounts of traffic on the chain????
Or is it going to do the same thing Bitcoin has done since the price drastically rose???
I think he would have to prove that bch could actually handle the load before anyone would take it seriously.
As old as Bitcoin is they still haven't been able to fix those type of problems so it's really hard for me to believe a brand new coin not a month or two old yet has solved these problems so fast.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:36:01
It makes since to me, I am not an investor, I use BTC as currency and that's that. When the price is low and stable BTC works awesome. You seem to misunderstand me altogether. Low price and stability make btc cheap to use and much more efficient.
BITCOIN worked great for me for over two years at low value and it worked great for others for much longer than that at a much lower value.
Edit, I never said I need mass adaptation , it worked great before I'd just like it to go back to the way it was.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:26:32
No I sure can't, fees are crazy high right now. Bitcoin doesn't really work for small day to day txs at the moment. I mean it used to be great for them but since the price hikes recently fees have gotten so high that it's basically only for traders and investors in it's current state.
I used btc everyday for over two years for my day to day expenses but I had to throw in the towel a couple months back because it just became to expensive and also it's just unreliable with the insane wait times now a days.
I hope they get all that stuff sorted out because I honestly liked using it.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:11:41
Uhhm you use the Send option, get the address from the wallet you want to send to by using the Receive button. Fees are high right now so just becareful
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:46:36
I am going to guess it was how your fee was set that caused it not to take it. By the way I've never heard of pulse.io ???is that a real site because there is a popular similar site called purse.io I know of.

man i can not even guess, if you read through the top posts in this forum youll see that fees are crazy right now. if it were me i would wait until the blockchain gets cleared out. it is currently really backed up and that means fees are probably the highest they have ever been.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:28:12
You'd fair better if you ran one of those passive video watching sites from over on Reddit beermoney forum. It's not my cup of tea but lots of folks do it and earn between 1 to 3$ a day. You can do that on one of the gpt sites that pay in Bitcoin if your wanting to earn coin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:37:05
If you do not see that then you need to look closer. Overall the value raising and falling pretty much determines the fees because it determines if people are buying and selling like crazy.
I'm not sure if you just want to try to argue for the sake of arguing or what but it is a documented fact that 2 years ago when the price was much lower and much more stable that it was practical to use btc for day to day expenses. It was not only practical it was the cheapest was to send and receive payments if you worked online like me.
of course the fees are prohibitive due to the blockchain being overwhelmed and lagging behind. The cause of the increased traffic is due to the value rising or falling at least 90% of the time if not more.
I agree with you that the price of btc should not effect the ability to use it, and honestly it doesn't make it impossible but when the price jumps or falls like it has been the past few months then it costs so much to use Bitcoin that it just isn't a viable option to use as a daily currency for buying all your needed goods and services.
The entire point of my first comment was this. I continually see folks boasting that BTC is going to become a new world currency and be used as money by all. All I am trying to say is that as BTC is in its current state that if everyone in the world tried to use it then it would become completely useless.
Could you even imagine? As of now a very tiny amount of people use BTC when compared to the world's total population. All I'm saying is that it's a fact that when the price jumps or falls as it has been doing the past several months that the traffic created by the price spikes slows the chain and raises fees to a point where it simply costs an insane amount of money to use BTC if you want a text confirmed in a reasonable amount of time. And even then it can take several hours to confirm.
I am not trying to run BTC down, I'm actually a big fan of it and have been for over two years now. To be quite honest with you I actually have used BTC much more than most folks ever do. You see for the past two years and four months I have taken at least 80% of my weekly pay in the form of BTC. Not very many folks are able to do that. I've owned many coins and spent many coins and I have never so much as bought a single cent of BTC.
I'm speaking from first hand experience when I talk about this subject. Because I actually took my pay in BTC then I used that BTC to live off of like you would cash money.  I loved using BTC, my employers paid extra for taking coin instead of cash. And a lot of times I either saved or made a little money off of the coin I earned.
Well that was nice for almost two years up until the price started growing really fast in the past few months.due to the rising cost of fees and unreliable tx confirmation times(I especially had problems with employers setting low fees and stuff getting stuck) I have had to go back to direct deposit and paypal payments.
I had to switch back because in the current state the cost of using Bitcoin is obscene compared to every other available option I have to choose between. It got to be so much it was really becoming a noticable amount of my earnings.
To sun it up, I actually have been using btc everyday to support my family just as if it were dollars for over two years but the high cost has made that to expensive to do any longer. This is a fact learned from personal experience.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:43:50
Once you get the card you just pay tx fees for sending the coin to your card. It costs ten bucks to get the card

@_date: 2017-11-14 08:54:20
I'm just someone who works online and for the past two and a half years has been paid in btc every week and completely supported himself from BTC. I did this up until it became insane to do so due to extremely high fees and long confirmation times.
I didn't realize btc was only supposed to be for an elite class to invest in.
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:32:37
Like I said I am strictly speaking towards the folks who claim btc will take over and be used as a new world currency. That's what I was talking about. Btc sure was practical a year ago but the price raises sure stopped that. I'm well aware it's valuable but that has absolutely nothing to do with my point. It would be much more valuable to me if it would drop back to 600$ and stay there forever.
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:50:58
I don't think the solution is to spam the pool with nonsense TXs
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:26:15
thats exactly what happened. you can send the remainder from your wallet to another wallet with a high fee and make previous low fee TXs confirm
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:12:37
How can BCH be more profitable to mine when they claim it has fees like Bitcoin used to have? They say you can send TXs for a couple cents on BCH so how on Earth could it pay more to mine that when Bitcoin fees are the highest they have ever been? Do the miners not get there pay from fees?

If they sent you any emails using the same email that's registered to their PayPal and the emails prove they got there product and we're satisfied or they were trying to extort you in any way for a discount or something like that then those could help. I've won cases when the buyer tried to say he was going to leave me bad reviews if I didn't give a discount. But I also never do business using friends and family.
If this person got several others and claimed his account was hacked then it is possible PayPal will compensate both parties but once again the fact that friends and family was used for a business transaction may come into play.

Depending on the wallet you used you may be able to increase the fee. As it is that's going to take a long time to confirm and to use the via btc accelerator you had to at least use ten sat per byte

Or they actually use Bitcoin and wish it worked like it used to work before the price started raising like crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:51:16
Until the value of Bitcoin stabilizes I doubt fees will drop. The high value and big price jumps cause so much congestion now days it's not cheap and fast like it once was.

The amount of Bitcoin you have never changes it will stay the same so the USD value goes up and down as the value of BTC changes

Go to the wallet you sent from, click on the tx then click view on blockchain, once there copy the tx link in the URL bar and paste it here
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:26:55
If coinpayments sent you Bitcoin then there should be a link to view the TX on the blockchain. I've never heard of coinpayments but I have never had to do anything other than provide my address in order to receive Bitcoin in the past. Ask them for your tx number
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:47:38
And your getting TXs confirmed for that right now?
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:39:06
A tx is a transaction, it's just anytime you send or receive Bitcoin. You can click on the transaction or tx for short and click view on blockchain once you do that your tx number is in the URL at the top of the page on blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:13:33
You always need to check the unconfirmed TXs before sending. Well you have needed to do so for the last few months at least. There is a web page that tells you the current needed fee to get a text confirmed fast. Right now fees are probably the highest they have ever been.

i understand it is valuable i am just saying i constantly keep hearing folks claiming btc is going to dominate as the new world currency and that just doesn't seem possible to me. Reasons being that there is a very very small percentage of the world using bitcoin at the moment and look at the problems we have right now. I could not even guess how bad it would be if everyone in the world started using it.
This is coming from a man who happily used bitcoin every single day for almost a year and a half for day to day expenses.

If I were you I'd wait until this mess is over before transferring anything. Once you buy your coin on coinbase then you can send it to any wallet you choose to use. There is a link in the side bar with trusted wallets.
I use mycelium on Android for btc and coinomi for other alt coins.
On desktop I use electrum and occasionally blockchain.
I'm by far no expert, I only know how to use Bitcoin and that's about it. It's really easy once you get started. I just know everyone recommended to always use a wallet that you are personally in control of and all the ones I mentioned do that.
There's lots of info in the bar, check it out.
And yes ,once you transfer it from one wallet it is no longer in that wallet. Lol, hence the transfer aspect of it all.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:20:10
I've never had bitpay tell me what fee to use. Bitpay tells me the address to send my coin to as well as the amount to send. Then I use my wallet to set my fee and there is no additional bitpay fee.
Right now you will be paying an extremely high fee to send any btc. You'd be crazy to send 10$ in btc right now because your fee will probably be that much or more.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:54:20
I just wish they would fix Bitcoin, I have no desire to start using a different coin.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:10:34
Hah, the network can't handle the current traffic. If everyone tried to use it I would say it would become completely useless. Unless you wanted to pay 25$ to send 1$

I'm in southern Ohio and we let ours drip through the real cold nights and always have. It works
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:08:01
Yeah, I'm not in a revolution. I've used btc daily for over two years up until it became impractical to use for day to day transactions the past few months. It used to be great but anymore it just costs so much to use it's in no way worth it to me.
I don't see how driving the folks who actually use something away from it is a good thing. I mean if people quit spending it will it not eventually lose it's value?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:32:08
If Bitcoin became mainstream right now in it's current state then it would be completely useless. As it is when the price raises or drops the chain gets so backed up that fees are outrageous and TXs take forever to confirm.
Until these problems are fixed then I think any more growth or mainstream attention would just hurt it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:35:48
Of course they have, I'm sure millions have been lost as well as millions have been made
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:09:15
Yes it is, to get in to via btc you have to do it at the top of the hour. Start trying to enter your text about 2 minutes before the hour and then keep it up for a couple minutes past the hour and you can almost always get in.
I'm working over on grindabuck right now and a few folks just got in at the top of the last hour.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:15:36
No I've only ever used the free one. To be honest I've quit using btc altogether the last few months because of fees and wait times. It has just became to expensive to actually use as currency.
I think right now it's only good for people who are traders and investors.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:42:08
Does anyone really know that for sure? It is hard for me to believe that the people who control Bitcoin would allow it to reach the current state it is in if they knew the exact problem and how to fix it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:29:07
A lot of the dnm's as well as private dn vendors already switched to etherum, litecoin, or monero over the last couple months.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:55:41
That means the tx has confirmed on the payment processors side. You need to message purse support as well as possibly the payment processors support. Your coin shouldn't be lost it should just take a bit of time to get it figured out so you can send the rest of the coin.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:44:23
All BTC TXs are public and can be viewed by searching the tx number on the chain.

I have a question. I've used Bitcoin for about two years now and I used to love it. I am in no way an investor, I work online and take most of my pay in Bitcoin because my employers used to give bonuses for accepting Bitcoin over paypal.
For a long time it was great, it was much cheaper to use than any other money transfer method and I used btc for day to day expenses much like everyone would if Bitcoin took over as the dominate currency.
Well in the past several months btc has simply became completely useless to use for day to day living expenses or as a currency for that matter. The cost to get txs confirmed fast is unreal most of the time. If the price shifts then just forget about it.
Right now it is pretty much only useful for investors or traders who are making money trading large amounts and don't mind pay outrageous fees. 
My point is if a price shift renders btc useless and makes it cost 5$ to send 10$ or else you have to wait 36 hours for your text to go through then how on Earth could btc work as a world currency.
The current blockchain traffic is nothing compared to what it would be if everyone started using it. Such a small amount of folks are using btc right now and we have these problems I just don't see how anyone could say they think BTC could replace Fiat.
I used to love btc but now I only use it occasionally if I want to gamble or something that requires it. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:09:18
So if she said yes we're you going to sit there and wait on it to confirm?
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:58:45
Look what the rise in btc value does to the chain and fees. Everytime the price jumps or falls the chain slows to a crawl and fees skyrocket. This means nothing to people holding on and just watching an investment.
For people to say they think that the entire world or even the entire USA could start using Bitcoin and it not be catastrophic is just crazy.
A very small percent of people use BTC right now and we see what things as simple as a jump in value does. Just imagine if everyone used it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:17:59
ATM fees are currently about 500% cheaper than btc fees
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:39:01
That's all I was trying to say. It used to be the cheapest way to spend money online but with the increased fees and long tx confirmation times it simply costs to much.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:31:04
its going to depend on the fee you used. right now it is pretty expensive to get a confirmation within a few hours
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:37:07
Private dn vendors do not they run there own stores Edit, just to be clear i am not referring to the standardized markets like dream or toh. i am referring to the people who run their own private DN stores and relie on reviews throughout the forums for business.
If you had any DNM experience you would know what i am talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:04:09
I've got a couple hundred bucks worth of bch, I've used btc for about 2.5 years. But I use it I don't invest. It's how I get paid because I work online and have a choice. Well it's how I used to get paid but I quit taking BTC for payment a couple months ago because Its changed to much. It's much cheaper for me to just take direct deposit.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:18:43
Right now the fees would eat most of your BTC up. I would just wait until things clear out some
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:41:41
Lol the fees on that .0001 bit would be a few bucks a pop right now
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:31:57
Coins are stored in your private wallet via the private keys to those particular coins. I'm not sure how you can use the same address for multiple wallets though? Maybe it's somehow possible but I personally have never saw it and it doesn't make sense at all to me.
Also there are definitely fees Everytime you send coin from one wallet to another.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:32:49
Yeah I find it funny how people who don't really use Bitcoin daily as a currency like telling us folks who used to do so that it's fine it's just fine. When in fact Bitcoin has been rendered useless for day to day TXs for the past few months.
It's nothing like it was six months or so ago. I used it daily for over two years and that just isn't possible now days unless you want to spend a fortune in fees.
Most vendors I use from the dnm's have all switched over to a different crypto in the past few months. Using BTC actually ruined several people's businesses on the markets because new folks didn't understand they needed to use a 6$ fee to send a hundred bucks so they start leaving bad feedback for a vendor because he didn't ship and in reality the vendors couldn't ship because the tx hadn't confirmed.
They really need to make some changes or something. I'd love to see btc work like it used to again.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:48:52
You can't even imagine the problems the vendors are having with newbs coming in every day and not setting btc fees high enough then trying to buy something. They think they have paid and when the vendors try and explain the new btc user screams scam.
That has been a nightmare for those vendors. I honestly think all of the private ones have switched over to other alts besides btc. I know all the ones I use have.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:11:31
you may have saw my comments the other day. i am not an investor, i work online and have a choice to receive as much of my pay in btc as i choose. so for the past 2.5 years or so i have been using btc for my day to day expenses.
i even got a bonus for taking my pay in coin, well i used to. I came to love btc and how i could use it for such a low cost.
Well i have quit taking btc almost altogether in the past few months because it has become useless to me. the fees have became so high i would have to be crazy to use btc over paypal now a days. not to mention the backlogs on the chain as of recently.
i have switched over to litecoin for stuff i do that requires the use of crypto currency.
Id love to go back to BTC anytime and i would with quickness if they would make it work like it used to work.

I think it sounds great. I think a lot of the ideas commonly repeated over and over again sound like great ideas and if they would actually implement them then maybe we'd all find out how well they work.
I generally catch nothing but hell if I post in either of the Bitcoin subs and I mention how Bitcoin just isn't useful for me anymore the way it was a couple years ago. Or hell last year even.

I started using Bitcoin around three years ago. I really liked it once I just quit trying to learn everything by reading and went ahead and made a wallet. I'm not an investor or anything, I work online and at the time my employers were pushing btc because of the insanely low fees. 
I have listened to different theories about how btc will dominate and be the main international currency and other ideas or a similar nature.
I always thought it would be very hard for it to become mainstream for the simple fact that occasionally a TX would take 25 or 30 minutes to confirm and I couldn't ever see that being practical as a replacement for credit cards or cash as I'd hear so many talking about.
I continued using Bitcoin almost daily up until the chain started bogging down and fees skyrocketed. Then it got better for a short time and then the price started growing and then the fees got so insanely high there was just no point in me using Bitcoin any longer unless I was doing something that required Bitcoin.
Don't get me wrong, I like Bitcoin, I think it's cool, and I still take a little of my pay in Bitcoin for my gambling needs and other bad habits. But I only ever take exactly what I need now as opposed to a couple years ago I'd go ahead and take all of my pay in BTC most of the time.
This is just a point of view from someone who is not an investor of any kind. Like I said, I loved it when it worked fast and had low fees but after this last few months with the crazy high fees like we all had to deal with Bitcoin is not something I have a desire to use anymore unless I need it.
After everyone saw the effect a jump in the value had on the functionality of Bitcoin i just don't see how anyone could still think BTC is going to become mainstream and used by everyone daily. If that were to happen TXs would take days on end and fees would require a bank loan to send 20$
