Ok, I might come off as an asshole but my uncle was driven to suicide from a mean ex wife who cleaned his bank accounts and 401k every 4-5 years for 20 years. He never got ahead. This may very well be fake and someone acting with cruel intentions. 
If this is real, my condolences.

Despite not having much of an input for this question it is interesting to hear how Bitcoin  could become controlled or suppressed. I am interested to see how it will react when Bakkt is available for institutional investors. I am about to make a rather large stake in Bitcoin before Sept 23, but I'm really waiting for 7.5k -9.5k  to buy in. The goal is 1 BTC

To avoid making assumptions I'll let someone else answer who has actually used  one.

We're all regular people. Start at coinbase, link your bank account, deposit funds, wait for confirmations, exchange dollars for Bitcoin or any other crypto currency. 
Disclaimer: Never exchange/buy/invest more than you are willing to loose. 
Good luck!

So is that really only $20? For shipping. Beta pre ordering has me wondering if the $150 charge will come later.

Here’s some advice young aspiring investor. First of all I applaud you for having the intellectual capacity to be interested in investing at your age. When I was 20 I only had 3 things on my mind girls, partying, and friends.
I don’t want to come off as being condescending but I don’t know you. 
Read books on investing, study technical analysis and have a basic understanding of trends and terminology. Watch the markets before before putting your hard earned money at risk for a loss. Save Fiat currency before you start messing with crypto. I am willing to bet the majority of people on r/BITCOIN has a career has a fiat 401k that doesn’t touch the crypto space. I know it’s a way of the future but diversify within the real market along side your crypto hustle. Crypto has great ROI’s at times but I don’t loose sleep over my fiat accounts because the markets are closed while I’m sleeping. 
Patients is a virtue. Never be too quick to put you money at risk. Never take others people buy and sell advise; own your wins and losses because everyone has their own agenda. Learning how to play both sides of any market should be your goal.
Full Disclosure: I hodl BTC LTC ETH. I’ve lost thousands listening to other people’s advice a long time ago. I Auto buy through coinbase all three once a week every week.
