I'm disappointed by the sexism in some of these comments. It won't help adoption.

A business that's open 24 hours in one of the high traffic neighborhoods, like the Best Buy in Union Square.

You don't think I tried that?

I thought there was already one at Old Shoreditch Station. Any Londoners able to confirm? 
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:30:18
 as well, shameless self-promotion as I run the site :)

No, security issue.

Yes, the Robocoins do BTC -&gt; Cash. There's only one in operation now, though, in Vancouver. So it's CAD, not USD. bitcoinatmexplorer.com/makers-of-atms/robocoin/

Sorry!

Money orders are another way to transfer wealth. They are also potentially obsolete with bitcoin.

Up and at them! 
@_date: 2014-03-14 12:04:15
This one? 
I would just call Bitcoin Decentral and ask them. 
Probably a good idea for anyone who is traveling any distance to use one of these machines. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:30:41
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:58:32

It seems to me that many of the commenters are victims of motivated reasoning.

Let me know where you end up installing it, I'll add it to bitcoinatmexplorer.com!

@_date: 2014-02-23 05:13:52
Yeah, there are dozens of stories for some of these locations.

 (might be a little out of date)
 seems to be a map of locations they've sold to, not installations. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:47:04
I run [bitcoinatmexplorer.com]( and try to keep it up to date.
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:16:02
I don't think they're installed yet. I've only seen news stories announcing them.
@_date: 2014-02-01 13:37:41
Where is the ATM going to be positioned after? I want to add it to my map!
@_date: 2014-02-03 03:48:33
Localbitcoins as others have said. There are also bitcoin atms in Vancouver, Ottawa and Toronto.
