I don't know honestly, got involved buying off Silk Road (first one), had 20 or so btc, had a bunch the feds stole when they took silkroad down too. I held my btc, when the first spike occurred in dec 2013 I sold 19.7, so got around $18k I think. I held onto 1/3rd of a bitcoin as I didn't want to sell completely. I re-bought a few months later and got around 60 for the same price (this is all from memory so it's not 100% accurate) I sold when it doubled again a few months later.
I kept buying and selling, sell when I thought it was too high, buy when it went lower. I didn't always time it perfectly for sure, I often could have sold higher and bought lower but my timing wasn't too bad.
Anyway yeah, around 20 btc were turned into 140 btc and $165600. I sold 138 for $1200 each last night :) I lowered my sell orders to $1200 when it seemed to run out of steam and $1500 wasnt happening. I'm happy with $1200
It was never even an investment, I just bought them to buy drugs off SR1. I never trusted other markets so I didn't use them elsewhere. 278 btc was around 55% of my net worth yesterday. I sold 138, like I said. So its back down to about 25% or so. Which will help me sleep better than having more than half in btc. I'm 30, and thanks to bitcoin I have around half a million dollars total.
I've also been cashing out regularly, if I'd saved them all I'd have well over 1000 btc :( I looked at old LBC trades and it was painful how cheap some went compared to current price (but I also have bills to pay)
@_date: 2017-02-26 01:16:28
i can still buy more. plus it was only half.

Thats USA based right?
@_date: 2017-02-25 06:20:28
Yeah USA.
Unfortunately I have a passport from a small, unimportant South East Asian country and I know if I randomly deposit $100k into a US account it's going to be a huge struggle to prove I'm not a heroin dealer or something stupid. I don't trust the US government enough to put a large amount of my life savings under their control...

ill check it out. I'm registered on just about every exchange there is.
* Most of the ones in China (obv not a good choice right now)
* Bitstamp fucked me, froze funds for around a month demanding stupid KYC stuff years ago, don't use them, as soon as I got my money out fuuuuuck that.
* Lakebtc are alright, but don't trust them with more than I have to. They once froze my account for a few days for their own error (not a huge deal but still don't trust them, also claim they're in China but haven't been affected by the PBOC stuff which seems odd to me)
* igot tried to fuck me, now it looks like they fucked everyone, so I'm glad they tried me early on and gave me time to avoid before they exit scammed.
* mtgox repeatedly denied my verification :D :D or I woulda lost a lot there probably lol.
* Coinbase is in the USA, and I don't trust the government there not to randomly do some crazy confiscation.
* Kraken sucks, like I said I'm 2/2 with them sucking both times I used them.
It's hard to find anywhere to trust with that much money. I'd love to sell on LBC but the spread is too wide here in Asia
@_date: 2017-02-25 14:17:12
bitcoin is easy. every idiot using darknet markets is proof. there are literally junkies managing to meet people on LBC to get btc to find a fix.
the only time it's too "complicated" for the average user is when you're actually scamming them and they don't trust you in the first place. That is when asking for bitcoin worries them and puts them off.

I sold around half of mine with sell orders at $1200. 
Feel pretty good about it to be honest
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:54:32
edit, $96600. Can't withdraw off stupid kraken
@_date: 2017-02-25 06:18:14
poloniex is US based :(
@_date: 2017-02-25 05:04:30
my holding crept over 50% of my net worth yesterday so I sold about half. tbh over 25% of my net worth would prob cause me trouble sleeping, the recent rise I kept checking btc price every 15 mins and knew I'd sell the second it reached ATH. Glad it worked out for me (this time)
@_date: 2017-02-25 12:07:07
advcash.com works well
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:37:43
actually more like 1/3rd since kraken wont let USD withdrawals, so i had to rebuy and withdraw btc.
@_date: 2017-02-24 07:04:59
278, currently sellin 178 across multiple exchanges with sell orders up to $1500. i cant see it being sustainable if it goes that high and i will buy back in if it goes back down. if if doesnt go back down i still have 100 left :)

website looks like it was designed in 2003, way to advertise the future.

@_date: 2017-03-19 04:07:56
thanks, i just tried that again with no luck. it's weird that it works with the web interfaces but not the wallets :/
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:23:10
same, most of my entry was between 250 and 600, first time i've sold a decent amount was before the ETF. 
only held, never sold, until recently
@_date: 2017-03-20 05:51:04
tried to short dash with leverage, look at his history. I recognize the /u/ from ethtrader
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:57:16
I bought at $900 and $950. Sold a load at $1200, $1155 and $1000 over the last month or so.
Not entirely confident I played it right yet :/ Could still reverse again
