I don't argue with that. That is outside of the scope of this issue though. Password hashes weren't stolen from Apple. Stolen password hashes and brute-forced passwords are two completely different things. The victims machines in this case were probably infected with keystroke logging malware to begin with making it a moot point. All I'm saying is its stupid to put the blame on a service provider in this case.

Or, the price dropping may have freaked them out and caused them to cut the deal off early.

Not sure what version you are running, but here are forensic artifacts for TV v8. Look for the local host log or in the remote host appdata path.

Credentials in this context means username and password. I don't recall usernames and passwords being stolen from Target.

Confidentiality of ones user credentials is a user problem not a provider problem. *slams head on keyboard*
