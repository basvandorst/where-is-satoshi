Will this allow tourists to Kenya use bitcoins to pay local merchants on the ground (so that they don't have to pay high fees for fiat currency exchanges and carry large sums of cash around)?

Interesting study. Thanks for posting this (albeit, you posted at the wrong time, as you can tell that there are some other bigger news going on right now in the Bitcoin world).
You listed "less than national average of participant’s country" twice. I assume one of them is "about the national average"?
Also, did you see a big difference between the results captured from Reddit vs bitcointalk.org?
Have you considered a selection bias? I am sure there are a lot of other people who purchased Bitcoin but aren't on Reddit and Bitcointalk.org?
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:38:33
I support! Though ideally local merchants in major tourist destinations should start accepting bitcoin so that I don't even have to convert into fiat to begin with. It's such a headache to deal with foreign currencies.

They are holding on to the royalties and then send the author 90% of the royalties back after one month. While this is similar to other e-book platforms (albeit lower fee), I think this is still "Money 1.0"-thinking.
it would be so much better if they send back the royalty at the time of transaction. When someone buys a book, 90% should go to the author directly, and 10% to the website as part of the same and one and only transaction on the Blockchain. It would be much more transparent.

Can you look into "%AppData%\Bitcoin" to see if the wallet.dat file is still there (I assume this was on Windows?)
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:34:22
Correct. Even while Coinbase takes 3-4 days to fulfill your BTC purchase, you will get them at the price of the initial purchase.
If you have a large holdings of BTC, many people suggest that you put that into cold storage (paper wallet), just in case someone somehow got access to your Coinbase account and steals your money. Google "paper wallet". When done correctly, it's your safest way to hold BTC.

They aren't gone. If rumors are true, hackers made use the malleability issue unfixed by MtGox for years, so presumably those hackers have those coins now.
If the other rumors are true, someone at MtGox still has them. 
The only way to truly lose bitcoins is to throw away your private key or sending money to some bogus bitcoin address.

Why is this post being downvoted? DeathByFarts has a real, valid point. You really don't want to re-use a bitcoin address for multiple transactions. It really is fairly easy to look at patterns and determine what you use the money for.
I hope people only downvoted this because of the tone by which this advice was given with.

I am using the  Bitcoin Wallet, and I don't see an "advanced send form" (nor can I find an advanced option). Can someone point this out to me?
Does this also mean that I would have to manually generate a new wallet address just to be able to paste that into such an advanced send form. Would be great if the wallet app generates one for you.

This is a really good introductory article for these 76 percenters. The author has actually attended two Bitcoin conferences and actually does a pretty good job introducing Bitcoin to newbies in this article.
**TL;DR  Summary of what article touches upon:**
* Makes a distinction between Bitcoin the protocol and bitcoin the currency
* Mentions volatility (though mentions how you can avoid the volatility problems by staying within its ecosystem)
* Mentions recent regulation developments
* Gives a basic primer how to get started with a bitcoin and a wallet and exchanges.
* Mentions Litecoin, Coinbase, Overstock
Interesting quotes:
* *"However, Bitcoin is more competitive than credit cards in emerging markets where one-third of humanity is excluded from the financial world."*
* *"I can now see how Bitcoin could eventually be used as widely as email."*
* *"However, regulators are somewhat powerless if they wanted to totally outlaw Bitcoin. They would literally have to outlaw the Internet to do so."*
* *"If you are not familiar with Bitcoin, I challenge you to try it"*

If the Bitcoin protocol states that the longest block chain in the chain is considered the correct one, I assume that every once in a while we see the chain forking with competing branches for several confirmations before a longest chain is established. 
How come we never ever see that on blockchain.info or blockr.io? Or does it happen that rarely? These websites always make it seem that it's always a linear progression all the time.

The chief executives of six major bitcoin exchanges and businesses pledged a coordinated efforts to assure customers of the security of their funds in response to mounting concern about the future of Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox.
In statements released on their various corporate websites, the CEOs of the firms—exchanges Bitstamp, BTC China and Kraken, as well as broker and payment processor Coinbase, wallet provider Blockchain.info and payment firm Circle Internet Financia—sought to separate concern about Mt. Gox, where an ongoing freeze on bitcoin withdrawals has stoked fears of bankruptcy, from those in the broader bitcoin community.
"This tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt. Gox was the result of one company's actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of bitcoin and the digital currency industry," the statement said. "There are hundreds of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in bitcoin. These companies will continue to build the future of money by making bitcoin more secure and easy to use for consumers and merchants. As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today."
"In order to re-establish the trust squandered by the failings of Mt. Gox, responsible bitcoin exchanges are working together and are committed to the future of bitcoin and the security of all customer funds" the business leaders said. "As part of the effort to reassure customers, the following services will be coordinating efforts over the coming days to publicly reassure customers and the general public that all funds continue to be held in a safe and secure manner: Coinbase, Kraken, BitStamp, Circle, and BTC China.
The statement didn't offer specifics on the actions that would be taken.
Attempts to reach Mt. Gox's offices in Tokyo by phone and email were unsuccessful.

Don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin and support its wide adoption. I think it's great that you are enthusiastic about Bitcoin.
There are indeed great benefits for having a public QR code that you can quickly show and get people to send money (think of the guy who had that sign at one of the football TV news airings), but it does remove anonymity quite a bit.
It's not that hard to break down transactions. If everyone re-uses bitcoin addresses, it's actually really bad for the anonymity of bitcoin. Imagine you donate money to this political candidate or purchase some porn, and they re-use bitcoin addresses too, then you immediately have a link between these two wallets. Just because people are posting bitcoin addresses all over the place, doesn't mean it's the right think to do. Even Reddit does this incorrectly, and I am afraid that it gives the wrong impression that this is the right thing to do.
 is an example done right where you generate a new bitcoin address for each donation.
TL:DR; I think it's fine to have some public address that you advertise, though it really should be short-lived; ideally one per transaction.

Sorry for not being clear. Coinbase does not have access to Overstock's inventory. Overstocks just sends coinbase the information it needs to render the page with the QR code or the coinbase payment page.

*BIT Poised to Become Publicly Traded Bitcoin Fund*
By MICHAEL J. CASEY
Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust is poised to become the first publicly traded bitcoin fund, with approval and assignment of a ticker symbol by the financial industry’s main self-regulatory body paving the way for trading on an electronic platform operated by OTC Markets Group .
The BIT, which was first launched in 2013 as a private fund for accredited investors with annual incomes greater than $200,000 or assets of more than $1 million, has been racing against a rival offering by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, best known for their lawsuit against Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg .
While the competing Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is going through a lengthy Securities and Exchange Commission process to register a formal exchange-traded fund, the BIT has taken a backdoor route to public listing. By exploiting a rule that allows holders of a private fund to sell their shares publicly after a 12-month lockup period and completing a less arduous approval process with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, some of those long-held shares in BIT should soon be available to investors of any income or wealth bracket. The BIT is sponsored by Grayscale Investments, a unit of Mr. Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, which he established last year to hold the digital currency interests of his broker-dealer SecondMarket Inc.
The creation of a publicly traded bitcoin investment vehicle is seen as an important milestone for the digital currency’s bid for mainstream acceptance. Bitcoin advocates hope that regulated instruments will encourage a wider investment base as investors will no longer need to own bitcoin directly, which can expose them to hacking risks. Those same enthusiasts hope that more liquid trading will help smooth bitcoin’s notoriously volatile price and thus make the digital currency more appealing for online payments and value transfers.
Neither Tyler nor Cameron Winklevoss was immediately available for comment. In the past they have argued that their offering will be superior to the Digital Currency Group’s because investors will want the full imprimatur of the SEC before buying an ETF-like vehicle. Without SEC approval, Mr. Silbert’s fund can’t be formally classified as an ETF, but once existing shares are offered publicly it will function very much like one.
As of Sunday, BIT shares were being cited under the temporary ticker symbol BTCV on OTC Markets’ “pink sheets” site, which includes over-the-counter offerings from companies with limited information disclosure. Price quotes are being supplied by Merriman Capital, which has been given a 30-day exclusive status to function as the fund’s initial market maker.
Mr. Silbert said Finra granted its request for a permanent ticker symbol, GBTC, and that “is expected to be effective shortly.” He said Grayscale is also separately “working through the approval process to enable the BIT’s shares to be quoted under the Alternative Reporting Standards on OTCQX, the top marketplace operated by OTC Markets Group.” That top-tier marketplace holds issuers to significantly higher standards of disclosure than is required for its pink sheet listings.
It is unclear how much secondary trading there will be in the BIT’s publicly listed shares. Any new shares, which are generated whenever Grayscale purchases bitcoins, can be sold only to wealthy, accredited investors. The size of the secondary market float will depend on how many early investors take advantage of the expiry of the lockup period to sell.
In a statement, the Digital Currency Group said, “Although we have been assigned a ticker symbol, no assurances can be given as to when or if such trading will commence, or that an active public secondary market for BIT shares will develop or be maintained.”
Many investors who purchased their shares at the BIT’s launch in the fall of 2013, when bitcoin’s price was around $100, have an incentive to sell. Even though bitcoin’s price is well down from its peak around $1,150 in early December of that year, at the current $247 price quoted by news site Coindesk, those early investors have a chance to realize a healthy profit. The Digital Currency Group is also allowed to offer a limited amount of its proprietary shares to the public, which would encourage the development of the secondary market.
Each share of BIT is worth approximately one-tenth of a bitcoin. As of Friday, the trust’s net asset value stood at $24.43 per share.

This is why we need bitcoin now: for tourism. Last time I traveled to a country in Africa, and I had to buy flight tickets from some unknown, small airline. I was so concerned about typing in my credit card number on their dinky-looking website. I would have preferred to pay in Bitcoin even if it would be more expensive.

No transactions just happened within the 43 seconds that happened between the previous block and this block. 
Or the miner deliberately chose not to include some of the transaction. It's technically allowed, though it would be in the miner's incentives to include as many transactions as possible to collect the transaction fees of course.
