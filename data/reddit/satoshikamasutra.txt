I'd been thinking of writing a post here exactly along these lines but I've just been too busy\^H\^H\^H\^Hlazy to get around to it.  You can argue all you want about the technical merits of Lightning Network vs. increasing the block size or comparing the market cap of Bitcoin to gold or Visa or whatever other bullshit metric you want to use, but at the end of the day valuing Bitcoin isn't like valuing AAPL.  You can create somewhat reasonable projections for how many iPhones Apple will sell in the next few quarters and use that as a basis for what the stock should be worth, but at this stage in its development, it's impossible to know what the Bitcoin ecosystem will look like in a year or two or three so the valuation is almost purely speculative.
The reason I'm bullish on Bitcoin in the long run is simply because the longer it goes on without completely collapsing, the more it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  I expect the value to continue to swing wildly up and down in response to events, rumors, and a hundred other factors and I expect there will be long periods of time when the value is relatively flat (as was mostly the case from 2014 through 2016).  The more the value drops in response to some panic, the longer it may take to recover, but as long as it doesn't completely fail, the temptation for people to get in on the next "bubble" will ultimately be too strong to resist.  As someone else said here, "the road to $50K is going to be bloody" and I expect plenty of volatility along the way, but baring some black swan catastophe, I'm pretty confident we'll get there (and $100K and $500K and who knows).
This isn't to say that investing in Bitcoin is entirely without risk.  But the risk isn't that everyone will wake up one day and say "OMG these are tulips! Sell! Sell! Sell!".  Unlike tulips, you can't grow more Bitcoin, it doesn't wither and die and has real utility aside from looking pretty.
Where I think there is some small risk is on the engineering side.  I'm not suggesting that the current development team isn't up to the task, and I'm not nearly well-informed enough about the state of the codebase or the network to pass judgement on the technical aspects of it.  But my day job is software engineering at a large ecommerce concern, and most of what I work on involves distributed systems.  It's very challenging and stressful and I've seen people who I consider to be much smarter and more skilled than I am royally fuck things up.
However, given the momentum that Bitcoin has, I think it's likely that even if there are engineering failures along the way that set things back, they would have to be enormously catastrophic and unrecoverable to completely destroy Bitcoin, and I suspect the odds of that happening are pretty low.

You'd be surprised.  Smart doesn't necessarily mean competent or sane.  I've been in the technology industry for twenty+ years and I've met some very, very smart people who were totally dysfunctional in one way or another.  One programmer I worked with could describe every algorithm from memory as if he were reading from a textbook, but had a style of programming that could best be described as "terrorist".  His sloppy coding brought down a multi-billion dollar ecommerce site twice before he was pushed out the door (he works for Google now, amazingly enough).  Another one was absolutely brilliant at designing and diagramming beautiful, complex system architectures, but every time he sat down to actually code he would only manage to write a few lines before having a panic attack and freezing up.  Yet another could crank out as much code as any other three people in the group combined, but couldn't seem to help letting his desk pile up with so much crap on it that it looked like a toxic waste dump.  I could go on, but the point is, I'm not surprised to hear that a brilliant programmer would simply allow a problem like this to fester until it got to the point where the whole thing came crashing down.

There are good and evil people everywhere.  What makes the government much more dangerous than private institutions is that the government has men with guns that they can use to force people to do as they please, whereas private institutions need to rely on persuasion.  Bernie Madoff harmed thousands of people by lying to them for years, but lacking the ability to use force, he wasn't able to say, dictate that millions of people should lose their health insurance.

The problem is that there isn't any evidence that the state any good at "macromanaging" the economy, and quite a bit of evidence that it isn't.  The practical problem with central banks is that they're essentially committees that decide what the price of money should be.  This makes no more sense, and yields no better results, than having a committee decide what the price of potatoes should be, rather than leaving it to the free market, i.e.: the decisions of millions of people who collectively have more information than any small group could possibly have, no matter how intelligent and well-informed they might be.

So?  Bernie Madoff gave millions of dollars to charities over the years.  He was still a crook.
That Karpeles's cold wallets have been seized by the FBI is a paranoid fantasy that there's absolutely no evidence for.  And even in the highly unlikely event that were true, unless it happened the day before the site offline, it's still no excuse.  Regardless of whether the Bitcoins were lost, stolen or seized, the simple fact is that MtGox hid that fact from its customers and continued to accept deposits knowing that there was no way that they could possibly pay them back.

Defining what is or isn't "legitimate currency" isn't required.  At the very least Bitcoin is property.  If someone steals a painting, then the amount they've stolen, and the amount they'll owe if they're caught and the painting can't be recovered, is the market value of the painting.  Doesn't matter whether you or the judge think it's a good painting or a piece of crap.

Deregulation is a myth.  During the past few decades, including under Republican administrations, the amount of financial industry regulation, as measured by the number of pages devoted to it in the Federal Register, and the number of people employed by regulatory agencies both increased.  If there is too much lobbying of the federal government, it's because the federal government is too big and too powerful.  Shrink the government and reduce its power and the problem goes away.

That might have something to do with it, but I suspect that the biggest reason that the young are more statist is simply because that's what they've been taught.  The Left has slowly taken over the education establishment of the last fifty years and reshaped the curriculum to reflect their beliefs.  As older teachers and professors have gradually passed on or retired, and have been replaced with younger and more left-wing colleagues, the chances that a student would be exposed to an alternate point of view has declined accordingly.

Regulation protected us from Enron and Bernie Madoff, remember?
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:43:53
I guess it depends on what you mean by "regulated".  If by "regulated" you mean that the US (or some other) government should impose rules on people and organizations who want to use Bitcoin, as they do for those who participate in financial markets, then I'd expect that most Bitcoiners would be against it.  If by "regulated" you mean that the people and organizations who use Bitcoin can contractually agree to the rules under which they'll be bound, and expect the government to enforce those contracts if one party violates them, then I'd expect that most Bitcoiners would be in favor it.
I don't need the government to tell me ahead of time under what terms I'm allowed to engage in commerce with another person or organization.  What I do need is the government to enforce contracts that I and another party have voluntarily entered into if the other party violates the contract.

I didn't say it couldn't work for a financial site, just that it was a poor choice.  PHP is turing complete, so you could write any program in it that you could write in any other turing complete language.  But as you said, you have to be more careful in PHP than Java, and human beings will always make mistakes, no matter how careful they are.  When the cost a mistake could lead to catastrophe (as it did in this case), you should be taking as few chances as possible.

There is no irony or contradiction here.  While many, but by no means all, or even most, Bitcoin holders are libertarians, libertarians certainly aren't "anti-government, anarchist people".  Most believe that the proper role of government includes protecting people from force and fraud, but not say, dictating much soda people are allowed to drink, what kind of health insurance they are required to buy, how many hours a week they're allowed to work, etc., etc., ad infinitum.

It's kind of sad that there are so many people like you who refuse to even understand and acknowledge what the other person is saying, let alone even consider whether there's some merit to their argument.  As Brambleshire has tried to explain repeatedly, regardless of what you call them, there's a difference between laws that protect people's rights (e.g. you may not steal, murder, etc.) and laws that simply dictate what decisions people are allowed to make, regardless of whether anyone else's rights are impacted (e.g. you may not buy a 32oz soda).  If you can't understand that, then I feel sorry for you.

I'm afraid that you're right.  People who say that validation will harm Bitcoin by reducing its fungibility are absolutely correct.  Coin validation sounds simple and reasonable on the surface, but once you get into cross-jurisdictional issues it's likely to become a complete nightmare.  Imagine a local judge in Brazil rules that some of your coins are actually stolen and the court reports this to a coin validation service.  Is that judgement enforceable in a U.S. court?  Who knows and do you want to have to go to court to litigate it?
Unfortunately, as the saying goes, "hard cases make bad law" and I'm afraid that the first time a Bernie Madoff steals some poor widow's Bitcoins, or even worse, a kidnapping ransom is paid in Bitcoins, the political pressure to require coin validation will be very hard to resist, regardless of some obscure common law precedent from 17th Century Scotland says.
This is going to be a big, big problem, much harder to solve than any technical issues.  It's something that we need to start talking about how to deal with, rather than just downvoting people who bring up the issue and pretending that we can make the issue go away by ignoring it.

Except that there's no real evidence that the txid malleability exploit is what caused Gox's collapse.  It seems more likely that the coins were stolen years ago because the site was insecure and malleability was used as an excuse when the exchange finally collapsed.
I'm not saying that you should never use PHP.  I recently had an informal conversation with the publisher of a print and online magazine who was unhappy with his web site, which is written an PHP, and was thinking of throwing it out and replacing it with something else.  I advised him that given his requirements he'd probably be much better off hiring some good PHP consultants to fix what he already had rather than throw it all out and start from scratch.  As long as care is taken to keep things like customer account information isolated from the web site, PHP is just fine for something like an online publication.  What's the worst that could happen if a security vulnerability slips through for an online publication?  Hackers replace the front page with "You've been pwned!!@ for twenty minutes until someone notices and fixes it?  People who aren't subscribers might be able to read the articles without paying until the hole is fixed?  Big whoop.
With a financial exchange, any vulnerability, or say, a mistake that leads to incorrect calculations, would be (and apparently was) catastrophic.  There's a reason why financial companies generally build these kinds of systems using Java or C and not a programming language as muddled and inconsistent as PHP.

I don't doubt that there was intentional fraud and dishonesty.  Even if Karples lost the coins through incompetence rather than intentionally setting out to steal them, by keeping this fact hidden for weeks, months or possibly even years, he crossed the line from incompetent to criminal.  I'm just saying that without knowing what we know now, I can understand why Fenton might've thought that the lack of financials were just the result of a poorly run operation, rather than the result of a criminal conspiracy.

Except that when a merchant swipes your credit care she gets confirmation within seconds that the card is valid and hasn't been reported stolen.

I keep my passport in my dresser drawer, which isn't connected to the Internet, and so can't be accessed without getting past my doorman and locked door when I'm not home.  My Bitcoin keys are encrypted and currently stored on a USB key, that's also in my dresser drawer.  If I want to use my passport, I take it out of the dresser drawer and put it in my coat pocket, which also isn't connected to the Internet.  However, if I want to use my Bitcoin, I need to put them on a device that is connected to the Internet, and if that device has been comprised, then they can be stolen.
Furthermore, given the choice between having my passport stolen, and my Bitcoin stolen, I'd much prefer to lose my passport, which, unlike my Bitcoin, can be easily replaced.

Folks, the fact that these withdrawals are being published by the Gox API does not prove that the wallets are still controlled by Gox.  The only sane way to build a system like the MtGox API is to give it a list of wallets that you "own", program it to monitor the blockchain for activity for those wallets, and publish the results.  If you were to design a system to use any "source of truth" other than the blockchain, you would be basically be guaranteeing that you'd be publishing bad data any time there was a hiccup anywhere else in your system.  So assuming that the API system is designed the only way I can imagine it could be, then anyone could be moving the coins in those wallets and the API would still be publishing the activity.

The Fed is a bad idea for the same reason that a committee appointed by the government to set the price of potatoes would be a bad idea.  No matter how well-informed, educated and intentioned the members of the committee were, they couldn't possibility have enough information to know what the right price should be.  The Fed is same as my hypothetical potato-pricing committee, except that they set the price of money, instead of potatoes.
Unfortunately too much criticism of the Fed is tied up in conspiracy bullshit, like this, instead of just focusing on why the Fed is just a dumb idea.  This alienates the majority of people who are not conspiracy-minded and discredits saner reasons to oppose the Fed.

While I agree with you that government regulation is undesirable, I agree with the other commenter that it's inevitable, unfortunately.  People have been conditioned to believe that regulation is a good thing and protects them from getting fleeced, and governments have men with guns, which gives them the power to enforce regulation.  Add as many layers of obfuscation and encryption as you want to it, the only way that Bitcoin is going to succeed is if it can be transferred to and from the existing financial infrastructure relatively easily, and the only way that's going to be allowed to happen is if there's some amount of regulation.
