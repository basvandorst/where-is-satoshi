One factual mistake in the first 10 seconds. Generally, your investments accounts are inflation-proof, because they generally represent companies, which have actual value, which  compensates the inflation (and often grows even more than that).

It's called arbitrage. I don't think there are currently any reliable exchanges with such a price difference.
The three things that will stop you are
1) Slow movement of cash. 
2) Fees
3) Your bank will start asking questions after you do this 3-4 times and will probably close your account. It's not worth for them to deal with your tiny amounts that set off all kinds of red flags. Most likely you will have troubles with the money transmission laws.
It's not impossible to do it, but if you decide to do it, do it on a large scale. $500 profit is not worth dealing with your bank account being shut down.

Bitcoins are being mined, so they are in their inflationary period. It will not last. Most coins will be mined by 2030. By 2040 so few will be mined, it will not affect anything.
However the demand for Bitcoin grows faster than we mine them, hence why the price went up so much. This will keep happening. 
There are 21 million bitcoins in total. If a billion people end up using it, owning even 1 bitcoin will be rare.

I think what really happens is bitcoin.de reporting is incorrect.
Let's say the market price is around $600. If somebody puts a small limit order to buy at $700 (by mistake, or because they are idiots), it shouldn't be reported as a $700 sale. Instead the exchange should match it with the sell order at around $600 and pocket the difference.
Otherwise it would be trivial to manipulate the reported price by selling tiny amounts at, for instance, $1000 or $5000, or $1,000,000 per BTC.  
@_date: 2014-01-22 00:33:14
Why would anybody accept a dollar, which is guaranteed to lose value?
Because people like to buy shit. 
Because people need to buy shit.

The question remains - why store the coins there? Deposit them for the purchase, make the purchase. Risk of them getting stolen in between would be very low compared to always having a large balance.
Heck, I don't store coins at regular exchanges, it would be pretty insane to trust SR.

You got it slightly wrong. 
You can generate valid wallet addresses super-easily, but you can't generate private keys from them - that's what makes bitcoin secure.
You can also generate private keys, and then generate corresponding wallet addresses from that, but you don't control what the address looks like. That's your regular wallet-key creation process.
You could technically generate trillions of them until one of them starts with a short English word by chance, that's how vanity addresses are created.
You however will *never* be able to generate something like 1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr from a private key, it would take much longer than the age of the Universe.

Gold is the last thing you want as a "solution". 
In no particular order:
1) Gold is useless in the internet economy. You can't send it over the internet. Would you mail your piece of gold?
2) Gold is easy to counterfeit. Even banks get fooled, and sometimes pay a lot for it. [Example]( [Another](
3) Gold is not limited in any practical sense. It gets mined at very high rates, diluting the value nonstop. The higher the price is, the more it gets mined.  The amount of gold on our planet alone is insane. The amount of gold in the universe is staggering. There's enough gold in the universe to build every toilet in the world in pure gold and you wouldn't even scratch the surface.
4) Gold is a bitch to deal with when it comes to transactions. You have a bar of gold, you need to pay $75.13 for your meal in a restaurant, how do you get that amount precisely? Do you cut off pieces until you get the right weight? Do you carry high precision scales with you?
5) Gold is not a good store of value. [chart](
6) Storing gold is a security problem. Storing large amounts of gold is a much bigger problem. 
7) Pretty much nobody accepts gold as payment. Bitcoin in 5 years gained 1000+ times more acceptance than gold did in thousands of years.

2) It's fraud, which is a crime in USA, Canada, Netherlands. Such an attack would get discovered VERY quickly.
3) It would kill BTC Guild's golden goose. They charge [pretty crazy fees]( from their miners.
4) Ghash.IO miners already demonstrated that they don't want to be a part of the &gt;50% attack by quitting when its share started approaching 50% a couple of months ago.

Bitcoin is very small at the moment, but make no mistake, if it ever gets wide adoption, there's absolutely nothing that will save WU and Moneygram. Transferring money will be as easy as walking up to an ATM, for both the sender and the receiver. (It already is, it's just not widespread, not enough competition).
And if people start getting paid and accept Bitcoin as payment almost everywhere, you don't even need to use an ATM, you can just transfer any amount for a fixed small fee. WU simply can't compete with that with all their overhead - tons of expensive stores, tons of employees, taxes, etc.

Your 51% attack fears are baseless. 
First of all, if you don't sell items, you won't be affected. 
Second of all, a successful &gt;50% attack (the correct name) is insanely expensive. There's no single entity or a government or a botnet in the world that can perform it.
Third, what's the very worst outcome of a successful &gt;50% attack? Somebody doublespends on a very expensive item. What item can you think of that one can buy with bitcoins  that is worth the attack? (and then able to cleanly get away, because it will definitely get noticed). I can't think of anything. Most purchases will lead to your mailing address at the very least. So you're left with digital items. You could probably double-spend betting in dice games. Considering the attack is ridiculously expensive, you'd have to bet an astronomical amount to actually profit from the attack.

Multiple holes.
Most important one - nowhere in the article there's a single reason that dooms Bitcoin.


How about transferring $600,000,000 worth of money with zero fees?
How about buying an internet service anonymously, like a VPN in a totalitarian country?


Two logical problems in one statement:
1) Issue has nothing to do with traceability
2) Bitcoin isn't more controllable than regular fiat. Try printing more bitcoins.


They aren't actually. The overall majority of wallets aren't identified. All you see is money moving from wallet A to wallet B, you have no idea who and where the owner is.


So? I just paid taxes on my 2013 gains, quite a lot of them. 
How is that a doom of Bitcoin?


If I have $1000 of bitcoin, and hypothetically bitcoin goes up 1000X,I make $1,000,000 after I cash out, I will end up paying 15% long term gain taxes. So I have made $850,000.
If I store $1000 in my bank, I'm guaranteed to lose 2-3% every year to the monetary inflation, and so I end up with even less.

It's one thing to answer their questions, but it's completely different to try and convince them to get into Bitcoin and prove it's better. Just don't do it.
Answer their questions to the best of your ability/knowledge, but don't try to convince them it's better than whatever they are using. They have to experience and learn it on their own.

It really depends on what you want to do.
HTML is not a programming language, it's a markup language.
Considering bitcoin libraries are available for a wide variety of languages, and APIs let you control bitcoins in pretty much any language, you need to sit down and decide what you want to create. 
A website, a web service, a standalone desktop application, a mobile application, and for which operating systems. There are too many options and so it's impossible to give a good recommendation since you didn't specify anything.

Here's the deal, in the end the rise/fall of bitcoin will make it or break it. It's the actions that matter, not the words of the talking heads. If bitcoins goes up, it will shut the critics up. 
Considering Bitcoin price hasn't collapsed after this epic MtGox fuckup, we're doing pretty well.

Brainwallet is only a problem if your password is stupid, like a dictionary word / common password / common phrase / quote from a book, song, poem / very short.
If you enter a random 15-character password, there's no way they would have that in their database.

Bitcoin is not "completely traceable". Pick a random wallet and try and trace it to... anything. Heck, pick some popular wallet with an unknown owner and try and trace it.
This is a completely made up criticism by the bitcoin critics who don't understand that once coins are mixed (like going into a dice game and then being withdrawn), there's no way to tell whose they are. One would have to have ALL internal transaction history (not on the blockchain) of every bitcoin site / exchange to even begin being able to trace anything.
All you see on the blockchain is money being moved between wallets. You have no idea if someone is selling on localbitcoins, or buying some drugs.

No, it's not. Benefits can include tons of things that you don't use and that you can't get as cash. 
For instance, my friends, a couple, are both working and both get heavily subsidized health insurance from their work. They only use one of their companies insurance to cover the whole family, because it's slightly better. The other one is a complete waste.
Same goes for gym membership you don't use, etc.

2) Deposit bitcoins

4) Once you're down to 0.2% fee, sell the rest in chunks of 100 BTC so you don't cause a massive price drop and lose money.
5) Call your bank and warn them about a large incoming deposit, so it doesn't get flagged
6) Withdraw USD to your bank

Neither is any other fiat currency.


Neither are the fiat currencies. Most of them are backed by the threat of violence / prison time.


Yeah, honey, there's no such mechanism for fiat currencies either. Or hyperinflation could be easily stopped, right?


That one is actually true. Explained by the explosive growth though.


Actually, owning most fiat currencies *guarantees* you will lose value. So far Bitcoin outperformed *every single* currency in the world every single year it existed by orders of magnitude.


Classic. And your currency is magically immune from that?

It might. We don't know.
But if the adoption continues, the demand will grow, while supply will remain roughly constant. This will drive the price up.
The only things that can stop Bitcoin (that I can think of) at this point are
1) A major bug in the bitcoin protocol that renders the whole thing useless. 
2) A complete ban on possession and exchange in every country.
3) Loss of interest / loss of trust in Bitcoin
We know  won't happen already, since some countries explicitly gave Bitcoin a green light. 
If  happens, a bug will get fixed, blockchain will be rolled back a week or so back, and it will keep going.
\ is the only realistic scenario that I can think of that will cause a complete collapse. Something major will have to happen to cause it.

Large amounts of cash are a bitch to deal with. 
They weigh a lot, they take space, it's illegal in many states to carry large sums of cash, pretty much no business accepts large amounts of cash. You can't deposit it into a bank (due to the money laundering laws), you can't buy a house or a boat or even a car without getting on IRS's radar.
Money laundering lets you convert all that useless cash into legal cash sitting in your corporation's bank account, which is trivial to spend and distribute.

1) Even if people do delay buying technology, it hasn't stopped the technology from becoming extremely successful and people spending billions on it. Hence your argument is bullshit.
2) People rarely buy a new computer/phone because the old one is obsolete. iPhone 4 from 4 years ago is just fine at running most apps, my wife has it. A PC from 2005 is perfectly capable of running a spreadsheet program for your business. People want new and improved, whether they actually need it or not. They buy it because they *want* it. 
The whole "deflationary currency will stop people from spending" argument is complete nonsense. People don't really want the currency itself, they want the things you can buy with it. And if their currency slowly appreciates in value, it would only make them happier.

And your chart conveniently starts at something like $30 million valuation, ignoring all the truly crazy volatility that had happened before.

That's actually the easy part. The virus steals the private keys and puts them into a giant database with the rest of the private keys and corresponding wallet addresses. 
Then you watch blocks mined in real time, and every wallet that receives money gets checked against the database, which takes milliseconds. 
If there's a match, you simply issue a transaction using bitcoin API.

There are a few ways to distribute money. 
Bitcoin chose to award new coins to those who do mining (which should really be called transaction processing). This system is rewarding the early adoptors and those willing to risk their money.
Counterparty did it through "proof of burn", which basically gives you coins if you destroy your bitcoins. They say it's more fair, but it just rewards the already rich who have extra money.
The truly fair way would be to give everyone an equal amount, but there's no easy way of doing that.

That's why I do all of my bitcoin operations on a clean Linux install, and I *never* do anything else on it, like I never browse random websites, or install random software. It's still possible to get hacked through a rootkit, but that's much less likely than just getting a virus through some zero-day vulnerability in the browser.

Dude - You don't have a clue of how price forms, based on that statement alone.
You, for some bizarre reason, think that market cap is the sum of all money that was put into a security. It is absolutely not.
Market cap is just the number of coins (or shares) multiplied by the value of the last trade. It has nothing to do with how much money was pumped into it. It's a pretty poor metric at that.

Just because you have an antivirus, doesn't mean you don't have a virus.
New viruses get constantly created.
Or maybe your passphrase wasn't that good.
What was your passphrase btw? (since you got hacked, it's useless anyway).
And how was it stored?
Considering the last time you spent from that wallet was in 2013-10-22, I think the hacker either bruteforced your phrase or has been waiting for you to deposit more money (which you did).
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:13:57
It's not a stock either. It represents itself.
I prefer to think of it as a totally new thing, similar the most to a currency.
Valuations of anything are rarely defined by the utility alone. It's mostly supply/demand/sentiment.
I also doubt your calculations of its utility are even remotely correct. It can be a safe haven for every country with hyperinflation or just high inflation. That alone represents hundreds of billions of dollars.
It can be a safe haven for long-term value storage even for more stable currencies. USD lost 96% of its purchasing power in the last 100 years, by design. It's a hidden tax on everyone that never stops.

leagueman14 is full of shit. You can't produce such results with a tiny amount of BTC. You can't just make a limit order at $102 and then see it show up on a chart with a dip like that. Try it with 0.001 BTC if you don't believe me.
What actually happened, assuming that trade data is correct, is somebody dumped close to 6000-8000 BTC. 
The only mistake that could have happened to explain this is in the amount, not the price. 
And it probably is a mistake, because dumping such a large amount in one order is simply dumb. If you sell it in 500 BTC chunks on different exchanges, you'd get a much much better deal.
So either it was a mistake or somebody really needed the money.

Nodes are not central. 
My objection to the credit cards (which I do use when I have to) is not that they are centralized. It's the crazy fees and the limits and that they use fiat and that they only work in certain geographic areas.
Bitcoin decentralization is only useful to the network as a whole, it can't be shut down. There's no direct benefit to me personally. 
I only really care about the benefits of bitcoin, not how it works internally. Just like when I take a plane, I don't really know how it works, but I know it's the fastest and cheapest mode of transportation for long distances.

Brainwallets that got hacked had stupid passwords. Either too short, common passwords, common phrases, or anything from a book.

I'm quite good at PHP (among many other languages), and I'm somewhat familiar with bitcoind. 4-5 years ago I would absolutely recommend myself for this project. Now, a few years later, when I'm more familiar with security, there's absolutely no way I'd risk to develop an exchange/merchant system on my own.
You need at least 3 guys - PHP dev, bitcoind expert, and a security expert. Plus you might need somebody to develop a high-performance trading engine in something like C/C++/Go, since doing it in pure PHP is not recommended. That actually sounds like a fun task.
Again, security is the biggest concern by far.

If I do see an investment opportunity that I expect to grow faster than bitcoins, why wouldn't I invest my bitcoins in it? We're experiencing an explosive Bitcoin growth at the moment, hence the crazy returns. This will change once the market is saturated.

Wallets don't affect the blockchain, only transactions do.
All wallets exist simultaneously in a mathematical space. You can send money to any of them, but you can only generate keys to some of them, and mostly by luck.
So when you "create" a wallet, you're really creating a private key that has a wallet address derived from it.
The beauty of cold storage is that you can generate your private key on an offline computer (or without a computer even). As long as you don't expose that private key, and as long as it was created with sufficient randomness, it is secure.

* Low flat-rate transaction fees (which are about to be lowered further by 90%). 
* Impossible to counterfeit
* Limited fixed amount, will be truly deflationary in a few decades. (Related: loss of the currency increases the value of the rest of the currency. Related: no central authority with horrible monetary policies causing inflation and long term constant loss of value).
* No chargebacks
* Impossible to confiscate, unless you give up your private keys
* Nearly anonymous
* Nearly instant transactions
* Global acceptance
* Very secure storage, if you understand its security model. Very secure transport. No middle men.
* Flexible design, transactions can be transmitted over a variety of protocols, like SMS or radio.
* Programmable
* Allows radical transparency, proof of ownership, etc.
* Multisig (e.g. 3 out of 5 people are required to spend the money in a wallet)
* Cannot be shut down / banned due to its decentralized nature.

I wouldn't choose PHP for a finance project myself. Mainly for performance reasons.
But, most likely, it was chosen because the main developer was the most comfortable with it. And it's always the best choice rather than to use something you're less familiar with, in which case you'd definitely make more mistakes.
I wouldn't choose Cobol/Ada/Fortran either, simply because it's so damn hard and expensive to hire developers for them. 
Modern languages like C++, Go, Java are very nice choices in my opinion - good performance, tons of developers, tons of libraries, tons of forums.

@_date: 2014-04-03 15:28:37
There's no absolute safety with anything. Technically, if your firmware or hardware is compromised, no OS is ever truly safe.
Ideally your Linix should be installed on a separate computer. But having it installed on the same drive is still much more secure than just doing it on your main OS install. Just make sure you don't keep your private keys unencrypted. 
Always use a long random password and store it in something like KeePass. KeePass itself should have a good password and a decent number of hashing rounds to prevent the bruteforce (it should take at least a couple of seconds to verify your KeePass password).

With **deflation**:
**A**: $10 * (1 + 0.98^10 + 0.98^20 + 0.98^30 + 0.98^40 ) = **$34.75**

The good example I heard on one of the conference videos.
Think about the computer market. If you hold your dollars for two years, you can buy a computer twice as good. Or alternatively, twice as many identical computers you can buy now. So computer market is a deflationary market. Yet people keep buying them. Even though most don't need a new one.

And that's why I said "on average".
Everything loses value if you cherry pick the time frame.
The difference is, inflationary currencies like dollar are *guaranteed* to lose value, and thus are complete shit as a store of value.
USD lost 96% of its purchasing power in the last 100 years.
Bitcoin is designed to be deflationary (monetarily). It will actually be deflationary by around 2030-2040 due to coin loss.
And that's why I store my money in Bitcoin. 
Some random fluctuations in price don't make it a bad store of value. It was $13 a year ago. Even if you consider MtGox price, which is very dishonest of you, you're still up 192%. How did your currency do over the last year?

You're confusing inflation/deflation with fluctuations due to supply/demand.
At the moment bitcoins are inflationary, because they are mined. In a few years so few bitcoins will be mined, and many more will be lost, it will turn to the deflationary path.

Happened to me when I was trading bitcoin. Checking the price every 3-5 minutes. It became unhealthy, bad sleep, I stopped.
The thing that I realized is that the price doesn't matter, the adoption is the key. We need to concentrate on the adoption. I frequently move money and make large payments across borders, and every time I'm reminded how shitty current banking system is - shit takes forever, payments get locked somewhere, don't arrive, crazy fees every step of the way. Can't wait for Bitcoin or something similar to take over.

LOL. Then why do you need 10btc?

* Anything from Amazon, directly.
* Subway cards
* Taxi fares
* Anything in physical grocery stores
* Bills

And that disproves your point.
Inflationary currencies are still accepted.
Deflationary currencies still get spent.

So you just believe everything anybody posts online?
Pretty much nobody said it wasn't true, most comments said there was no evidence.

Your assumptions are crap.
Therefore your conclusions based on them are crap.

It means they want to sell you shit.
It's not that bad for mining Scrypt-based altcoins.

Thanks, good to know! 
This is complete propagation though. In reality you will see times half of that, on average.
And if you're in a physical store, you're likely to be both connected to the same or neighboring nodes. Which means sub-second travel time.

Notice they are simply sending tiny amounts TO the generated addresses, which they don't control.
It's impossible to generate a private key for a vanity address with so many characters, like this:
    11Lorem1psumDo1orSitAmetXXXWAEZ6C 
The search space is too huge.
What they are doing is simply generating *valid* destination addresses, which is trivial.

OK, so it's another Bitcoin clone. 
I don't give a shit about its efficiency or stability. Stability will come with adoption.

Mining *is* cost effective, if you're lucky enough to get a high-end ASIC rig in time.

Its useful properties - limited amount, deflationary nature, impossible to counterfeit, global acceptance, nearly instant transactions, low transaction fees.
The only thing that backs the dollar is the fact that US taxpayers are forced to use it, and the US economy is good (or was good).

Running a full node requires decent hardware that's always online. 8893 is a decent number of nodes.
What's the problem exactly? Nodes are just propagating transactions. Technically you don't need that many of them.

Of course it's possible, but to reach $500K/BTC it would have to become a major major currency with a total market cap of $10 trillion - so around what dollar is now.

Wallets, not people.
Many high-value wallets are owned by organizations, exchanges and law enforcement.
Now compare it to the global wealth distribution:

No. 
Losses are always much worse than whatever tax deduction you'd get.
I will use simple numbers as an example, and will assume you held your coins for more than a year, so you're in the 15% gains tax bracket. 
Let's say you bought 100 BTC at $10 per BTC ($1000 total).
**SCENARIO 1**: BTC price went to $500. You want to buy a $500 laptop. You sell 1 BTC for $500, you buy your laptop. 
Cost to you = $10 + (500-10) * 15% = **$83.5**
**SCENARIO 2**: BTC price went to $5. You sell 100 BTC for $500 total, you buy the laptop.
Cost to you = **$1000**, and you can claim a $500 loss on your taxes.

I don't think he meant literal slavery. You know what a metaphor is? Get yourself a dictionary.
Just like he didn't mean literal investment in children.

Inflation is not a cost.
Yes, bitcoins are inflating right now. So 25 BTC rewards dilute the value a bit.
Words have meanings. You can't just randomly use them incorrectly and not be called on it.

Looks like whoever did the integration in that shop really fucked up. 
0 confirmations is fine for a ramen shop, nobody capable of doublespending will waste their time defrauding a restaurant.
