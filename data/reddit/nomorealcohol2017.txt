How much was the album in btc? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:22:32
Might go up might go down
Can you afford to lose that 1k if it does?

I’m not really sure what he’s expecting?
This is the Internet after all
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:03:41
I know this is an old story but has that man ever spoke about it? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:28:35
Sorry to hear that mate, I know I'd be pretty gutted in your situation 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:21:56
That's good, probably a lot more relaxing that way for you too 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:33:33
I hope you've got money saved away, your lucky you only had one atleast
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:43:40
Transfer the smallest amount possible to make sure that you've got the correct address and then you'll be good

I'm in the uk and it worked for me 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:49:38
I've only used it to transfer my coins from coinbase to my wallet without the fees but have you tried gdax? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:38:02
Agreed, surely this saves you trouble in the long run no?
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:39:29
I have no problem with people spending money on cars but gold always looks too tacky to me 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:36:01
I'd imagine most sensible people would realise this anyway but I can see why people buy into the whole hype which is currently circulating 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:10:39
I'd appreciate it but I can see most people looking confused when they open it!
Not sure I'll do the same for secret santa but atleast it's something different 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:40:42
Buy the dip and HODL 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:14:22
I doubt anyone takes unilad as a credible source for information apart from teenagers
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:44:28
All sounds confusing to a newbie but is this good news?
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:48:16
Thought about getting a job?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:48:57
Remind me in a years time 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:13:45
Any uk website you would recommend to get involved in this? 
I'm pretty new to this but I'm happy for you early investors 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:45:05
Thanks I'll have a look, I've never invested in anything before but I'll do some research to see if it's for me 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:31:52
Thanks, I figure a small amount is worth a gamble
I'll check it out after work
Is it easy to sell too?
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:53:41
I managed to buy some btc and etherum about 10 minutes ago and had no issues
