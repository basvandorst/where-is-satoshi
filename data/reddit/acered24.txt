Currency traders most certainly pay gains tax as well. "Under this tax treatment, 60% of total capital gains are taxed at 15% and the remaining 40% of total capital gains are taxed at your current income tax bracket, which could currently be as high as 35%."

Which wallet?
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:25:15
You can spend bitcoins on bitcoin chain and you can spend bcash on bcash chain. You can do that with the same private keys because bcash copied the ledger, but only once. After that new addresses on btc and bcash chain will have their own separate keys. Bcash is a different coin, like vertcoin or viacoin. It's only more popular because it stole bitcoin name at the time.

The problem with backing things by other things is that there must be some 3rd party to whom you entrust the custody. Bankers had gold in the vault but eventually started issuing more claims to the gold than they had creating fractional reserve system.

Bad people aside, and whatever good things churches and religion may or may not accomplish, what evidence is there for the mind to rationalize and accept the existence of god? And is there a necessity? Surely some atheists are very nice upright people (and some are jerks, no doubt) and they don't get their morality from fear of punishment in the afterlife. 
Sure, the earth and stuff is all very miraculous. But you were told there is a god and now you believe it. Imagine you were told the all powerful being is just beyond the stars where you can't see, and its 400 appendages flow beautifully in nothingness of space. Imagine something less drastic, you being born on the other side of the planet, just around where Hinduism or Islam is predominant. You'd likely be a follower of one of those specific things. Geography of your birth determined your beliefs and entire view of life and the universe? Maybe if you were born in India and became of follower of Buddhism, that would have been OK, I guess. It doesn't require existence of gods and doesn't harm anyone.

Median incomes are up 10x from 5k to 50k. These products are actually now more affordable in relation to other expenses and the person's income, than they were then. The price "number" is higher, but so is the number of "numbers" in people's wallets. 
These stats without context make it look like you can only afford one tenth of the flour you could buy before. This really expensive flour today is 40 cents a pound. You can get a 10lb bag for $3.98 plus sales tax. Come up with examples that don't lie by omission please.

Send everything to a new address in your wallet. Pay at least 3 or 4 sats per byte. It will take a [while]( but if you're not in a hurry it should be fine. There is no benefit to sending it to "same address." Don't do that. Preferably use a [recommended wallet]( with segwit.

Yeah I understand blocks. This account maybe new but I've been around since 2013. There is no cap in the sense that you can always fit your transaction in. If you pay more in fees.
People do overspend when it's necessary. You'll pay $100 for a 50 cent bottle of water in the middle of sahara desert. And in more practical sense I recently overspent on an item which was a present to someone. It was kinda cool and fancy but cost way more than similar functionality items normally do.

It depends on how bitcoin fails. It may be a learning experience. The error will be fixed and another project will rise up impervious to the original failure mode. It could also fail catastrophically demonstrating that saving data in linked blocks in a distributed manner is a neat fad, impractical, unscaleable, doesn't work, etc. etc. This will result in loss of faith in all similar projects, massive drawdowns and a few cocky hodlers will have to get real jobs again.

For a long time it was quiet. Nobody talks cryptocurrencies. I was surprised to see a tshirt with some dogecoin joke once. Then for like a week in decemeber 2017 it was buzzing all around you. People at the bar showing phones to each other with coinbase app and how many litecoins they bought @ $220 or whatever. And yeah, I also said I had bought into some bitcoins. Kinda regret that now - bar people joke that I'm secretly a bitcoin billionaire. But anyway after that one big pump it's all quiet again. Nobody talks crypto anymore.
I think this time around things will be more muted. Many have learned a lesson, especially if they bought at the top and then sold out at a loss months later. Hitting new ATH will bring out gamblers out of the woodwork but many retail buyers from 2017 who have been burned might sit out on the sidelines.

Satoshi Nakamoto released his white paper Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System. Blockchain was the technology that underpinned the Electronic Cash System – Bitcoin and was the answer to the lack of digital trust because each time a transaction was made it was bundled together with other transactions and stored in a block. The block was then placed on the chain, which couldn’t be altered.

I cannot guarantee that although I used a zip file from that site before and it was fine. You should use a seed based wallet, not manage individual addresses on your own. That is ancient history stuff.


No an address is created when it's created. It doesn't need to be in the blockchain. If you create it with a wallet it should follow the proper rules and be usable when needed. Addresses are one-time use identifiers. Don't get hung up on and attached to addresses. Over time you're going to use thousands, probably. Let a wallet manage them for you.
The key space for addresses is extremely large. It is unlikely to guess someone else's key to their address even if you spend a lifetime doing nothing but guessing. Not with current computer tech. Don't worry bout that for now.

These duplicate chains you can easily create will have no miners and thus be completely insecure to 51% attacks. They will also have zero recognition or acceptance or trading or valuation of any kind anywhere.
So.. does it begin to kinda make sense? Does the phrase Network Effect mean anything to you? The more people use a network the more useful it is? Kinda like the telephone when it was invented and only 2 people had one, it was rather useless to everyone else. And once we had the telephone network there was no 2nd and 3rd telephone network. People didn't want to have 2 or 3 different phone types and phone lines running to each house. Network Effect.

If you do things right you can be 40 and doing reasonably well. Missed out on a lot of things, relationships, fun, whatever, but at least you're not broke.
Or you can have the time of your life, and at 40 wake up next to a spouse you barely tolerate, with kids you had too soon, a somewhat still functioning liver after all the boozing abuse it went through, and a nagging concern about whether to pay the insurance bill, mortgage, or car loan payment first.

Import (if words) or sweep (if QR code priv key) into a wallet like electrum or mycelium. Go to CB and look around to see if your limits are good. Don't want to send funds in if your withdrawal limit is $5 per day. Yeah coinbase sometimes does that shit, that's why people hate on it. Anyway, find a deposit BTC address in CB and send the imported or swept funds there. Don't mix up with bcash. Sell, while overpaying on fees (or look into coinbase pro to reduce fees).

No ext pub keys. You pick a coin and type in how much of it you have and for how much you bought it for and when. That's what threw me off.

Thousands of IPs.. like your node connected to 1000 other nodes? Ok. What does a node do? Downloads blocks, uploads blocks,  relays transactions. So.. If your own consensus rules affect downloaded blocks then you will discard new blocks from other nodes as not fitting your rules - effectively you cut yourself off and your block count is stuck. If your rules modify uploaded blocks other nodes will discard them and ban you. If your rules do something with transactions then new transactions that don't fit your rules will be dropped, or when you change and relay transactions they will be checked and dropped by everyone else. Your 1000 connections will dwindle down to nothing as the network bans you one node at a time.

No. They cannot send with just the app and password. They must also have the physical ledger device.
You can keep the app on PC. It can't do anything except look. The spending keys are in the ledger nano.
Yes you can retrieve your keys with your 24 words (not characters). So does anyone who gets your word list.

No there is no cap. You can always pay more fee and bump someone else's transaction to have yours included. Not everyone has the same needs. Someone will not mind being bumped. When I'm consolidating some wallets, I can wait, no big deal. And at all times someone can pay a higher fee if they need it to confirm. The limit is when the fee is higher than what's being sent but it's not a technical limit. You STILL COULD pay miners $100 to transfer $1 and they'd be happy to include that transaction vs one paying lower fee.

You buy lottery to feel a little excitement when checking it to see if you won. You don't invest into lottery, you just buy it, like milk and eggs. It's a consumer good with entertainment value.
Bitcoin can be valued. Look on any exchange. The price you see is what someone is willing to pay for it. There, you just valued it.
How do you value any company really? Like Apple? You can see how they did in the past but what guarantees are there that it will continue to make money? Everyone who wants an iphone already has one. Other companies already make arguably better phones, tablets, and earbuds. You are assuming that in the future apple can continue to pull miracles out of its butt. That's a form of gambling. No lines on charts, revenue statements, or anything that happened in the past can affect stock price if the company runs out of its steam. Even now the stock price is way too high because just about any tech or index or dividends ETF has apple in it. It's hard to *avoid* owning apple shares, so don't forget to include that artificial demand for shares in your evaluation.

Basically amazon verified a code as good, then later figured it was probably bought with stolen credit card or something, and cancelled the code. Giftcard balance was reduced in my amazon account. It was like $50 that I paid maybe $42-43 in BTC just to see if it works. It was most likely CC fraud rather than seller cancelling the gift. Because I remember they sent me the code and it didn't work. I told the seller your code doesn't work. They sent me another code. Completely different, not off by a digit. Seller had some code generator or were buying them in bulk with stolen credit cards.

You will lose funds trying to roll your own python key generation. Get a wallet. One listed on bitcoin.org. Electrum is good. No you don't need to get the reference client with the whole blockchain download. The address is inserted into blockchain when you send funds to it. You'll need to provide one of your addresses to the exchange when you withdraw, they will publish a transaction to the network, and boom your address will have funds. You don't have to pre-register addresses in any way.
Wallets holds keys, never any coins. Read up on this more, it will help you in the long run. Wallets know how to create perfect addresses. Valid address is generated from pub key, which is generated from priv key, which is generated by the wallet. Addresses are shorter than keys and have a checksum so they are kind of a space saving and typo proofing feature.

That's not the reality. Mining is a business, not a charity. If you run a business and can buy supplies cheaper at one place than another you'll pick the cheaper supplier. Point of business is generating profit. Bottom line, as they say. Why do large corporations "go green" or "buy american" or whatever else that seems like an added expense?
