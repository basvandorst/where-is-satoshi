The post on has some good discussion going on

Yeah I know a lot of people did but I give it a look once in a while and the first few comment chains are decent. Also saw somebody say has a good thread going but I haven't looked at it yet

Well the top comments of every thread in about this are all along the lines of "this is a Russian-Trump-Assange distraction" so they don't seem to keen on discussing it. Probably best this one is on the front page

If you want the truth cryptos are kind of an artificial market right now. Not to say they are useless. Coins like bitcoin, ethereum, and ripple are here to stay. A majority of bitcoin's use is just the trade of other cryptocurrencies and its unsustainable in the long run. It's like, imagine if half of the transactions using the USD were on the stock market. The worth of the Bitcoin and every other crypto is inflated because it is being traded between the same (not to make it seem like a small number, it's a lot of people) few million people and while cryptos serve a purpose there's nothing to make it seem like it will jump to being mainstream. 
If you want to invest now, get into the pump and dump because anything long term is risky. There's gonna be a crash and that's why you short btc
