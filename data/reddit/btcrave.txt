Counterparty is a meta-coin on Bitcoin like Colored Coins.  But it uses an intermediary currency in which counterparty transactions natively occur.  No one really wants to have to transact back and forth into this currency to accomplish certain tasks, such as coin creation, that with Colored Coins do not require the use of an altcoin.  
I think XCP makes Counterparty inelegant.  But that's also partly a matter of taste.  Colored Coins vs CounterParty may be a battle yet to come.

Yes.  Another way to look at it is simply if interest rates went up, interest payments would skyrocket!  
At 100% debt-to-GDP, even just 3% interest rates = 3% GDP per year in interest payments.  With Federal Revenues at 20% of GDP, interest payments would immediately become 15% of all revenue.  That, of course, would have to be paid for with newly raised debt.  The only thing that could solve this would be an end to the fiscal deficit, which is nowhere on the horizon.
It's really bad.

Open Assets allows for trustless exchange of assets and/or BTC.  But order matching can happen off-chain, there's no need for orders to be on the chain itself.  It's slow and wasteful imo.

@_date: 2014-10-09 22:40:04
I think what you're saying is uncontroversial.
Open Assets itself is not a money maker.  There are absolutely no gatekeepers.  Anyone can make or transfer assets in Bitcoin only.  All the code is out there.
I think Counterparty made poor design decisions, that's all.  And I fundamentally disagree with Vitalik's vision for many interrelated but floating altcoins.  I must be a 'Bitcoin Dominance Maximalist' as he so comically puts it.  Really though, I think the crypto currency space is only going to hit it big time if it enjoys the full network effects that come from unity.  
There's nothing wrong with progressing technically.  I think that's what all of us want.  But if you need to make another altcoin each time you iterate, there will be far too much fragmentation for real adoption to occur.  Build and improve on a common system, however, and this stuff can really take off.

@_date: 2014-10-09 19:59:25
Vitalik, thanks for chiming in.  Let me address your points.
- The fee to create an asset as spam protection.
 
There are ways to make assets independently trackable, so not every tracking server needs to follow every asset.  Paying a fee to be 'tracked' could be an off-chain arrangement, whereby you pay for your color to be tracked by a third party.  So a fee-as-spam-protection is not necessary to economize on monitoring costs.
Also squatters are not a problem with Colored Coins since an almost infinite space of Color Addresses exist.
- XCP as 'abstracted away' and thus irrelevant.
I'm sure it could be abstracted away.  But my point still stands that functionality must be unlocked with an asset with a floating price.  That's really annoying and inelegant no matter how buried it is for the user.
- Side chains as too-high a technical burden for innovators
Look, we want to do things the right way.  If we're inscribing equity in the Blockchain, maybe it's worth taking the extra effort to do it right, instead of quickly.  Sidechains obviate the problem of floating XCP.  Just because it's hard, doesn't mean its wrong.  Unlike many other Bitcoin projects, equity representation needs to be done right from the start.
- Decentralized Exchange is possible with Colored Coins.  
(I'm pretty sure, someone correct me if this doesn't make sense)
Write a TX with colored inputs and BTC.  By playing with the order of the colored state of the outputs, you can exchange colors for BTC, or colors for colors, in such a way that multiple parties sign off on the TX inputs after that the outputs exchange assets correctly.
- The one correct point you made was the one I did not argue in my post
Colored Coins don't have SPV.  That is true as far as I can tell.  A side chain implementation could have that, in addition to avoiding the hassle of converting to an altcoin with a floating price.  
Vitalik, I have the highest respect for what you have accomplished technically.  But I'm not sure you are allowing for the possibilities implicit in Colored Coins and side chains because you are personally wedded to Ethereum, which has taken a dramatically different strategy (i.e. another floating altcoin).
@_date: 2014-11-30 17:40:24
I'm aware of the difference between key/address.  See my comment above regarding scraping public keys from pay-to-pubkey scripts.
BitMessage does a lot more than what I profess to do here.  But it's also not tied to Bitcoin public/private keys.  That's the novelty: the fact that we're reusing Bitcoin keys to read encypted messages.

I'm a Bitcoin Engineer at Assembly. I've built a Colored Coins implementation on the Bitcoin Blockchain to track partners' ownership of products they build collaboratively.
As cryptographically secure tokens, Assembly Coins can be transferred with the same ease as Bitcoin with none of the currency risk. You can cryptographically demonstrate your ownership over businesses, earn royalties, and be an owner from anywhere.
We use a Colored Coins protocol to abstract ownership in Bitcoin.  However we store no proprietary data.  Everything you need is on the Blockchain and open source.

Bitcoiners, what is your profession?!!!
@_date: 2014-10-09 21:38:48
Vitalik, your comments betray a desire to fragment the cryptocurrency space because it is makes it easier to monetize your work.  You basically say this explicitly:
"The fact that you can create a new token as a monetization mechanism has a substantial chance to be a revolution in how we reward people who build things, and unlock opportunities and make things monetizable that were previously unmonetizable achieving an effect hopefully on the same scale that internet advertising did in the 2000s.
Note that my claim (2) directly contradicts the "Bitcoin will be the only one and rule them all" viewpoint (or at least the "it is morally good that Bitcoin be the only one and rule them all" subtext that is often present) that many people here support; I accept that disagreement."
"So, I am personally wedded to the floating token strategy, and I gave reasons above to justify my stance - you have to realize there was a reason why I went with that strategy back in Jan in place of the metacoin approach, and the only difference now is the possibility of sidechains, which I don't want to use even aside from monetizability considerations because (1) I'm becoming increasingly bearish on proof of work, and (2) I would end up being at the whims of the Bitcoin mining pool oligarchy. I understand that you and others will disagree."
Do you honestly think floating tokens are in the interests of users?  Or is it just convenient for developers to build and get paid?
In my opinion, network effects on Bitcoin must dominate.  There is one universal consensus ledger.  All the others will fall away to obsolescence over time.
Perhaps someone will make an Ethereum Sidechain tied to Bitcoin.  Hmmm that could be really convenient.  But that might be a disaster for certain vested parties.

Good points regarding random &amp; ECDSA!
As for the public key, it's my understanding that it is revealed for addresses that have liberated pay-to-pubkey-hash outputs.
So to RECEIVE encrypted messages, the public keys would need to be scraped from the Blockchain in these scripts, or simply declared by address holders.
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:59:37
You're right.  But there's more to it.
I would argue that the incentive by malicious agents to attack the network ALSO scales with the price of bitcoin.  So as bitcoin goes up, so too does the necessity of protecting it!  If, on the other hand, the absolute value (in USD) allocated to miners does not also go up, the network has increased in allure without gains in protection.

I actually think the opposite.  Lightning Network could increase the velocity of bitcoins.  If the same USD-value of transactions occur per unit time, but the per-BTC velocity increases, then the value will also decrease.
Consider that the value of a bitcoin stems from the sum of a) speculation and b) its real use in facilitating transactions.  B) can only decline if the velocity increases. 
That's not to say that Lightning Network is not a good thing, or that the total real value of transactions could not increase.
