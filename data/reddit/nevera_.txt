If thats the case, why is America donating so much money to Isreal? Shouldn't that inflation all be thanks to the US dollar being so helpful to Isreals survival? I mean they really couldn't survive without the US help.

The rumors of the difficulty involved in buying bitcoin were not, its very hard. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 17:26:26
A poor country adopting the currency early might have some pretty shit ramifications, maybe something good will come out of this for them though.

I wouldnt say this is price manipulation but in a single day a large amount of people with a large amount of coin will all decide to sell at a similar time, perhaps they see a downward pattern and want to sell for what they get, thats their choice. Most likely one large amount was sold for a lower price and that probably causes most initial downward slopes, but people being people and wanting to get the most bang from their buck are also selling when they see someone big sell. It will get to a point where its low enough for new interested buyers to see an opportunity

Fuck bitcoin it just ass rapes anyone who didnt get it at the beginning, and thats the point. Theres a reason why the maker took 1m bitcoin and disappeared. At first i was hoping for a globally acceptable currency instead its a competition of who can horde more. 
Its gone up 17$ in the last couple of days thats so volatile.

Until that private money becomes bigger more widely accepted than just 1 gridlocked currency, then they wont live together anymore.. Im just putting that out there. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 14:35:25
Yes indeed i didnt know this was disputed knowledge that bitcoin is a threat to the stability of entire currencies but an interesting experiment into a global even more stable economy. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:50:58
This attitude does seem a bit elitist bitcoin elite. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 22:49:30
People are going to be really pissed when everyone starts buying and the prices instantly shoot down. Stockpiling BTC is going to be the death of it
@_date: 2014-11-26 21:41:39
Certainly not, its like pachinko tokens, if anything happens transfer the btc data to a new storage under a new name.

Classic Katapult, we're aware of your post on Reddit today, telling people that anything they do can be deemed suspicious.. Now who would deem them suspicious? The US government? Well thats absurd! However by issuing that propaganda statement you appear to be a very suspicious character. We'll be in contact shortly.

@_date: 2015-05-02 21:01:16
Thats enough of that, if i ever make serious money its getting turned into bitcoin, lol dollars.. More like government funny money that belongs to them at all times and is never actually ours even if we worked 13 years for it.

The CIA has always been a Nixon era rogue agency, its been bad news since day one, espionage, plans to propagate war, gathering intel on each and every person, and now i bet they hold the worlds biggest facial recognition software in their back pocket. Dirty dirty.

Dear Markus, if you have a billion dollars, how about supporting your adventurer friends and giving us each 1 btc? 
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:06:46

@_date: 2015-04-22 23:02:31

I agree, however subjective value isn't usually that high for an online currency. While i agree with the idea, and a globalized currency would also be cool, I dont believe it will hold its value, or will become extremely saturated if it were widely accepted… (I guess that wouldn't matter, but it could end up being 100,000,000 bit per $100 us dollars. 
One glitch in the system and the entire market will crash. One hacker with enough talent and billions of bit investment will be lost. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:38:54
Rich people are such pricks.
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:04:38
Value is subjective? 
Who knew.
So by that standard currency only holds its worth as long as we believe in it.
Shifting that belief is dangerous, but moving away from gold is the right choice if you ask me… Then again.. Golds value is always decent because of its uses.
I think id rather have my moneys value be held by aging wine.. at least then I know im getting a steady increase of value as the years go by.
