If a service offers 2FA, I 2FA the shit out of it.

I guess people are going to get all his or her coins back by suing mark karples, huh?  
From my personal experiences over the past 2 years,  I trust btc-e more than any other exchange.  All of my withdrawals from btc-e have taken less than 10 seconds to be broadcasted to the network, unlike any other exchange currently in business.  Btc-e's MT4 platform is also a very professional tool that no other exchange can compete with. 
Like the above person said, it's all about reputation and no matter what the anti-btc-e mobs here say, historically btc-e has the longest and best track record to date.
You're doing nothing but spreading FUD and speculative claims about an exchange who has done nothing but helped the bitcoin community grow to where it is today. If you don't like an exchange, simply don't use it.  I would personally prefer to use btc-e over any exchange where I have to give up every last bit of my personal information and send an unencrypted copy to God knows who working in customer support.
It's well known that people shouldn't store coins on exchanges for long periods. But just because you know the owner of an exchange doesn't mean he, she, or individuals who work in customer support can't fuck you over. 
Satoshi wished to remain anonymous. Why can't btc-e remain anonymous as long as they're running a fair and legit business?

I have bought tons of items through Bitpay and Coinbase, and from my personal experience, Bitpay is the better company. Their support is always quick and phenomenal, while coinbase's support has been aggravatingly slow on multiple occasions. I am always relieved when I see a Bitpay invoice at checkout, and I will always choose to buy from a merchant that uses Bitpay over Coinbase if possible, because I know my experience, as a customer, will be hassle free.

You can archive an address to remove  the balance from your wallet's total balance. 
When you want to spend from that address, simply unarchive it and the address's balance will be restored and spendable again.

There needs to be a unified effort to not use these types of machines before we set an even more absurd precedence for future machines and regulations.

Do not use all4btc if you can.  I've had nothing but headaches using them.  If you have to use a service like this, Bitsumo is faster, easier, cheaper, and they actually communicate with the customer. Bitsumo forwards the customer all order confirmations and shipping confirmations from the retailer immediately. 
All4btc does not send any confirmations at all!  About 3-4 months ago, I tried to buy something from eBay using all4btc. The item was a "Buy it Now" item with three days remaining and 10+ quantity in stock.  I was left with my dick in my hand for 2-3 weeks wondering where my package was, only to find out that it was never ordered and the item was no longer listed for sale by the eBay seller.  After getting the run around from their very slow support, I was forced to get another inferior item at a lower price instead of a refund and even after they told me they would send me the difference between the two item's prices, they never did and I haven't heard anything else from them. So they basically stole around $250 from me in the end. 
Buyer beware when it comes to all4btc.

Bitpay accepts 0 confirmations so as long as your payment is broadcasted, your invoice will be marked as paid instantly. I've never spent more than 10 seconds waiting for bitpay to see that I have sent the payment.

I can't wait to buy a car and see the price as 20,000 mBTC 
People always use cheap items when promoting mBTC, but he or she rarely realizes that it's not going to be logical for the exchanges and expensive items to be quoted in mBTC.  
Isn't bitcoin about freedom and not being forced to use your money a certain way? Just use it when needed or as wanted and don't make it a global switch. 2 mBTC for coffee, 20 BTC for  car, 1 kBTC for a house or a business, or just stick to using decimals. 
The psychological argument is only relative to some people and shouldn't be spouted in every argument in this post.  If a global switch were to occur, I'd bet we'd be seeing the other psychological side of people not wanting to use bitcoin because he or she may think it's too cheap or may even think mBTC is a whole new coin. I personally know people who cannot understand SI units if his or her life depended on it, so the argument of lowering the entry level is redundant. 
Stop trying to force people to think the same as you. Let the individual or business decide and use what is easier for them be it decimals or SI prefixes. This isn't about you.

More than likely, it's probably the paid JTRIG gov agents trying to misinform and create fear about bitcoin.  There have been many cases in other subreddits, such as worldnews, where disinformation agents have been spotted, so it would be ignorant to not assume they are here as well.
