I made a post claiming that Andreas Antonopoulos is the new 'Bitcoin Jesus' (a nickname previously given to Roger Ver), since I have found much comfort and "faith" from watching his videos. But he [rejects this title]( which has only increased my respect for him.

I've only been involved for about a month, but my Ledger Nano S arrived today. What a relief to get my BTC off Coinbase!

Mine showed up in my Ledger wallet straight away - has it technically not transferred yet?

I can understand that. As a newcomer though, trying to research and learn as much as I can, this guy has given me "faith" and so I see a light-hearted comparison!

Don't you think there's something ironic about keeping your bitcoin passphrases in a bank?

Yeah - deposit your BTC from Coinbase into GDAX (which you do on GDAX), and then "withdraw" to whatever address you want.

achow101: "The release schedule is not necessarily accurate. While we normally do a time based release, 0.16 will likely be a feature based release and released whenever it is ready which will probably be some time before May."

But why would Coinbase legitimize them in January?

Use GDAX.com instead - it's connected to Coinbase.

Apologies! This was just a light-hearted post after watching your videos.
'Bitcoin Sherpa' is much better.
