I had sent 50000 bits to my bread wallet on my cell phone in November from my segwit address on trezor to test bread wallet out.  Was able to send what's left of the funds from my bread wallet back to my trezor.  
Fee was 23 bits to send 49977 bits from a non-segwit address, and it was confirmed in the first block.  $0.20 fee or so, really nice

Research never ends, continue researching.  Invest time into learning.  Also consider spending time trying to learn how money and the current financial system in general works, otherwise Bitcoin just seems like some obscure weird Paypal.   
Spending a little, or sending yourself some test transactions is a great way to learn how it works.  Make sure you understand how a backup "SEED" works, and that your hardware wallet should generate its own seed upon setup.  
[  
Hardware wallets generally use the BIP-39 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) standard for Seed derivation.

I bought a few pairs of brand new Red Wing Heritage Boots a couple years ago for $60 each after a website was closing and they liquidated their inventory for cheap.  I sold them through ebay and paypal, and shipped them all with signature confirmation.  
After a month, one of the buyers submitted a claim saying that they never received the boots, and paypal froze the funds and opened a case; its an automated system.  I contacted a Paypal representative, and I told them that the item shipped with Signature confirmation, so they took a closer look at the case.  They flagged the Signature Confirmation as proof that the buyer received the item, and told me in cases like that, I would most likely win the dispute, but the case had to be elevated to another person or entity for review before being finalized.  The funds ended up being frozen the entire time, and I think the final approval in my favor took an additional 1-2 months, **but I did win the dispute.**
Now, if the buyer had filed a "Not as described claim," I'd be shit out of luck, as its an objective measure based on the buyer's opinion.
The dispute system exists because fraudulent buyers and sellers both exist, but the system is definitely skewed more in the buyers' favor.

Its funny, when I mention Bitcoin to people at work in real life, even though they don't own any, or understand it, they still seem to be pretty optimistic about it, and many still think it is inevitable and the future, especially younger people.

What I do is just put a small amount from my paycheck each week into Bitcoin.  You can setup a recurring daily or weekly or monthly buy order on Coinbase for bitcoin.  I just divided the total amount of USD each week that I won't miss by 7, and setup a recurring daily buy for that amount.
Bitcoin is volatile.  It can be very stressful.  Bitcoin is a long-term phenomenon, you can help alleviate the stress over short-term volatility by increasing your understanding of what Bitcoin is.

If you had Bitcoin on the paper wallet before the hardfork occured, then after the Bitcoin Cash hardfork, you controlled keys to Bitcoin at the address for the paper wallet on the Bitcoin network, and you also controlled the keys to Bitcoin Cash at the same address as the paper wallet on the Bitcoin Cash network.  When you sent your Bitcoin from your paper wallet to your hardware wallet, the transaction was broadcast to the Bitcoin network.  Chances are the Bitcoin cash you control is still at the address on your paper wallet, and assuming it is still there, so is the BSV from the hardfork that occured with Bitcoin Cash later on.

Since you are new to this, you should dedicate a lot of time to learning about Bitcoin.  It takes a lot of time to really get into it, and the learning never ends.  
I encourage you to take in as many videos by Andreas Antonopoulos as possible.  He clearly explains how Bitcoin works, and why Bitcoin matters.  His youtube channel is here: [aantonop](
Andreas also has some books available for download, or you can buy physical copies on Amazon.  'The Internet of Money, Volume I and II.'  Volume II is especially good.
If you want to get into Bitcoin as an investment for the long-term.  Only put in money you can afford to lose.  Make a budget, and just put a little in every week.  Coinbase gets a lot of flack on here, but if you use Coinbase, you can set a recurring buy.  I personally just convert a small portion of my paycheck's USD amount per day into Bitcoin using a daily recurring buy at Coinbase, irrespective of the price.  Don't drop your entire savings at once, the stress will kill you.  Don't try to time the markets, again, the stress is real.

Even now, it's likely that less than 1% of all people in the world control any Bitcoin at all.   And within this group of people, the vast majority of those people entered since 2017.   Many of these people still view Bitcoin as very risky, and are using it as a speculative investment with the hope to make more USD.  They view it as a longshot gamble.  I think this is still the prevailing mindset for many people.  I don't think they quite trust Bitcoin enough to use it as a store of value.   Many of these people view it as a one-time buy event.  I believe that there is a big difference in mindsets between "investing" in Bitcoin, and believing in it and using it as a store of value.  I know this sounds stupid to many people.  
As such, the average amount of value that the majority of users is willing to trust Bitcoin with is relatively small.  If it were the case that 1% of all people (75 million) had Bitcoin, the average value per user would be $2,400.  (Bitcoin market cap divided by # of users)  It is a really rough and vague guess, and doesn't take into consideration that Whales control such a significant chunk and that an estimated 4 million Bitcoin are forever lost.  If there were 40 million users, average would be $4500. etc.  Even 40 million users seems high to me, though  
All I am saying is that less than 1% of all people hold any bitcoin, and those that do are only using it to hold a relatively small amount of value.  If Bitcoin is something you believe that virtually everyone in the world will be using on a daily basis years from now, then I think we are clearly still in the very very "Early Adopters Phase," maybe still in the "Innovators" stage.

A transaction with 0-confirmations hasn't "hit the blockchain," the transaction has only been broadcast to other nodes on the network.  If the original transaction has a low enough fee, the original sender only has to broadcast a new transaction with a slightly higher fee, sending the same bitcoin to themself.  The transaction with the highest fee would be the one that gets added to a block later on, and the original transaction is then invalid.  This attack has no cost.
It is completely different from a double spend, trying to change a transaction that had already been included in a block, which has a very significant cost.

The MtGox coins were hacked over a couple years starting before Karpeles acquired the exchange from McCaleb.  MtGox was insolvent when Karpeles acquired it, long before it melted down in 2014.  The truth is that the "hacked" coins were most likely sold at lower price ranges, before even the first 2013 bubble.
I don't know if you can really call it a hacking.  Transaction Maleability was a KNOWN bug at that time, that most entities in the Bitcoin ecosystem accounted for when implementing their software, while Karpeles tried to code everything himself, and never addressed Transaction Maleability in his software implementation.  Basically, a bad actor made a withdrawal from Mt.Gox, was provided with a Transaction ID, changed that Transaction ID before it was confirmed in a block.  They would then contact MtGox, saying the transaction never went through, MtGox would check the ID of the transaction, and it wouldn't be there, so they would issue a new withdrawal transaction.  The original Transaction still was sent from MtGox to the withdrawal destination.
When MtGox went under, Karpeles issued a statement basically to the effect of saying that Bitcoin had a critical bug/flaw that allowed for the loss of funds from MtGox.  Blaming Bitcoin.  He did the cheesy shamed-Japanese CEO bow to apologize in front of the Media.
2014 was just a psychological blow to confidence.
That said, this year has been feeling eerily similar to 2014.

If you are kind of new-ish to the space, the best way many have found to weather Bitcoin's volatility is through gaining a better understanding of Bitcoin, how it works, and why it matters.  Price is the least interesting thing about Bitcoin.   Viewing it as an investment is the wrong attitude.  If the price dropping is making you nervous, you might have "invested" more than you should have, based on your understanding of it.   
Andreas Antonopoulos' youtube channel is a very good place to start.  [  
Andreas has some books, "The Internet of Money" (Volumes I and II) and "Mastering Bitcoin" that are worth checking out.  
Many here appreciate  Saffedein Amous' "The Bitcoin Standard,"  which goes into some monetary history and makes an argument for why Bitcoin is the "hardest" form of money to date.   Much of the book is about the Gold Standard, which officially ended in the 1970s.  
The key thing that I got from this book is that the Gold standard never really worked, and can never truly work. This isn't really an argument that is made in the book, however.  Just me ranting.

Virtually everyone who tries to day trade loses money.  They act based on emotions, fear and greed.  People who are only interested in making more USD or Britsh Pounds aren't actually interested in Bitcoin, they are interested in speculation.  
I believe in Bitcoin in the longterm.  At the moment, this reddit is full of new people who only care about the price, posting celebratory memes about price milestones.  This is always an indication of irrational exuberance.  I don't know where Bitcoin will go in the short-term, it would not surprise me if it violently dropped by 30-50%, and it would not surprise me if it hit 20K in a few weeks.  No one knows what it will do.  For people who understand and believe in Bitcoin, it just doesn't matter.  These price swings mean nothing.  
My only advice is to invest more time into learning about why Bitcoin matters, ignoring the price aspect of it.  I realize this might sound boring to many people.

Being open source is one of Bitcoin's strengths.
Anyone can copy Bitcoin and make their own version.  Anyone can make a change in a current implementation of Bitcoin and hardfork onto their own, incompatible version.   
The copied and the impatible versions are not Bitcoin.  They are not recognized by the Bitcoin network.  They are not new Bitcoins.  New Bitcoins have not been created.  The supply of Bitcoin has not doubled.  They don't have the hashrate that Bitcoin has.  They don't have the user/merchant/exchange adoption that Bitcoin has.  
They are new versions that are 100% incompatible with the Bitcoin network.
It is a fundamental misunderstanding about what a fork is and how it works that leads to your conclusion.  
What we've seen over the past year and a half with the forks is that as more forks come out, they are continuously less relevent, and only have value from speculators.  Over time forks will become even less relevent as people understand what is actually happening, and speculators get flushed out.

I hate how articles describe the energy usage of bitcoin mining as the energy required to process transactions, and they then use this metric to compare it to credit card processors like Visa to show how "wasteful" it is.  
I've seen people try to debate this, and argue that the energy usage should be compared to how banks process transactions, store money, transport money, etc.  But this is a very poor comparison.
The correct comparison to make with regards to Bitcoin energy usage is to compare it to the Internet.  The internet, companies that use the internet to run their services, server farms, cloud, etc, use an incredibly large amount of electricity.  It is ridiculous to argue that the internet wastes electricity, and most people would agree that the energy it uses is well worth the benefits it brings to the world.  Eventually, Bitcoin will be the same.

I was present for Mt.Gox, but never used the platform.  This year has seemed exactly like 2014 in every way.  Mt.Gox didn't cause the bear market, it was just the catalyst for the bearish sentiment in the markets.  
Mt.Gox was insolvent years before they went under in 2014.  The majority of missing Bitcoins had disappeared when prices were in the single digits.  The bear market in 2014 and 2015 was just part of the normal market cycle; China banning Bitcoin and Mt.Gox imploding were just catalysts.  Karpeles blaming the implosion on the Transaction Malleability bug was the main catalyst I feel, people read that and thought that Bitcoin must have been broken.  The truth is that it was a widely known bug at the time, that virtually all exchanges had taken into account for in their software implementations.  
2014 was filled with seemingly good news.  Positive views on Bitcoin, more merchants willing to accept Bitcoin.  Acknowledgements that Bitcoin was a revolutionary idea.
Mt.Gox imploding had nothing to do with Bitcoin's potential, or how Bitcoin worked.  The same can be said today.  We are just going through normal market cycles in Bitcoin.  We went up too high, too fast over the last two years.  Too many people got into this not knowing, understanding, or caring what it is.

A '0-conf transaction' in Bitcoin Cash is the same thing as an 'unconfirmed transaction' in Bitcoin.  The only thing different between '0-conf' and 'unconfirmed transaction' is the name.  It's just the client-side software implementation that is calling transactions that have been broadcast to the network but not included in a block by these names.
Much like the only 'unit' recognized in the Bitcoin network is the 'Satoshi,' and it is the various software implementations/interfaces/wallets that call 100 million satoshis a 'bitcoin'
Transaction malleability just allows for the transaction ID to be changed after the transaction is originally broadcast; it does not change the amount of bitcoin sent, nor does it change the origin or the destination of the address.  I don't think Transaction malleability has anything to do with '0-conf,'

For over a decade, (maybe 15 years) I had been using the acryonym "pm," "private message" to refer to messages between individual users online or in-games, rather than in public/global chat.  I don't use social media or use my smart-phone for much aside from text messages, but over the past year I've noticed the usage of "dm" instead of "pm." (Browsing memes that have screenshots of twitter etc.) I'm assuming it is a more recent phenomena, but still it makes me feel old (I'm 32).   
Uh, my point is that in 15-20 years, there will be nomenclature usage in the mainstream that is completely different (and annoying) to us today.  
1 Bitcoin = 100 Million Satoshi (100,000,000)  
The unit "Bitcoin" is already a user-experience decision.  The only unit on the Bitcoin network that is recognized is the satoshi.

Some of the important features of Bitcoin is the fact that it is permission-less and censorship resistant.  Anyone can use it for whatever reason they want.  There is no person to say who can and cannot use Bitcoin, and no person to say how it should and shouldn't be used.
If you don't like a certain entity or how they might use Bitcoin, you're free to voice your opinion, free to boycott that entity, etc.  Noone can't stop anyone from using Bitcoin however they want, and that is its greatest strength.
Those that hope that Bakkt increases the amount of "investment" into Bitcoin, hoping that Bitcoin's USD value gets pushed up by big financial institutions are just gamblers and speculators.  My personal opinion is that they aren't *really* into Bitcoin, but this is how they have chosen to use Bitcoin, and that's okay.  I think I would have fit within this group when I first got engaged with Bitcoin, but it's been quite a mindset shift for me since then; I'd be lying if I said I didn't get distracted or a bit giddy when the value increases, but that's not the main reason I'm into this.  
My only concern with Bakkt is that large firms will "own" a certain amount of Bitcoin on Bakkt, use this to lend to other firms/funds, etc., and it will just branch throughout the financial system until there are several entities that have a "claim"  to the same Bitcoin on Bakkt's platform.  In essence, fractional reserve.  Bakkt-Starbucks-Microsoft-etc look to be trying to build a "Bitcoin" payment system outside of the Bitcoin network that relies on an amount of Bitcoin being held at Bakkt.  
I don't think Bakkt or ETF is interesting.  I won't be using either service.  I just view both as inevitable "attacks" on Bitcoin that will make it stronger in the long run, just like the NYA.
@_date: 2018-07-28 02:52:41
One of Bitcoin's major strengths is that it is open access.  Its inevitable that banks, financial firms, etc. will get involved.  
You can't stop people you don't agree with from using Bitcoin however they choose; if you could, it wouldn't be Bitcoin.  I don't like the magical derivatives tracking some index price thingy not actually Bitcoin ETF mumbo jumbo, either...
But Bitcoin will survive this, and continue being Bitcoin.  It will continue being the most secure, open access, decentralized, neutral, censorship resistant network in existence.

@_date: 2018-04-08 16:14:13
The way I've always viewed it, before Bitcoin can be adopted as a mainstream currency for every day transactions, it will need to go through a phase of eventual mainstream adoption as a stable store of value, that an ever increasing number of users believes has value and trusts the network.  
The way I view the BTC vs. BCH issue is summed up in Andreas Antonopoulos' video "Decentralized Truth" 
Holding Bitcoin is also using it.  You can't measure this by only viewing Bitcoin usage as transactions per day.
I'm not a programmer, developer, etc.  I believe Bitcoin can be the catalyst for a lot of positive change in the world in the coming years, and right now the only way I can help Bitcoin is by holding it  and trusting it as a store of value.  
I do use Bitcoin in transactions when possible, and replace it immediately, but I'm nowhere near a point where I'm living on Bitcoin completely.  I'd like to see more merchants holding Bitcoin that they receive instead of immediately converting it to USD.

@_date: 2018-04-29 15:07:28
I feel that Bitcoin needs to shake more btc out of alt-holders before it can continue up.  As a percentage of the market, Bitcoin is 36% right now, during the peak of the alt-boom in early January, Bitcoin was 32.5%.  Still feels like many alts are overpriced.
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:47:49
That's only if you price them in USD, when you price them in terms of Bitcoin, many alts are only down less than 40% from January highs, many are at or near all-time highs.  
Virtually noone will agree with this, but Bitcoin is the medium of exchange/store of value/unit of account in this space.  When the Bitcoin dominance is low, the total number of Bitcoin that the crypto-market is worth gets higher.  
Currently the crypto-market is worth around 46 million Bitcoin at 36.6%.  When Bitcoin dominance percentage increases in this space, the number of Bitcoin that the crypto-space is worth becomes less.
Many of these alts are only 'whitepapers,' no working products, billion-dollar promises, or worse.  
I don't feel that the alt-markets are at completely irrational levels yet, though.  There aren't really any alts I would gamble my Bitcoin on right now though.
Don't get me wrong, there are some amazing projects out there.  I don't feel that any alts are actually direct competitors to Bitcoin, however.
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:32:12
Virtually all alt-coins save a few and ERC tokens are hard-forks of Bitcoin.  Most of these forks don't use Bitcoin name, such as Litecoin.  Some forked from the original open source code, others forked from the network by making incompatible software changes to software implementations of Bitcoin at a certain block height.  
None of these forks are Bitcoin.  
These forks do not inflate Bitcoin's maximum supply.  
Anyone can fork Bitcoin.
These forks are not a threat to Bitcoin.
People just misunderstand what a fork is, but eventually more and more forks will come, and eventually noone will care.

Found out a co-worker has been a Bitcoin "Trader" since early 2016.  He was talking about something like "I'm a crypto-trader-enthusiast," only in the space to make USD profit.
He has no clue how Bitcoin works.  He was shilling "crypto" to co-workers, and Hard forks came up.  He told them something similar to what has been in many news articles about Bitcoin forks, namely that Bitcoin forks are like "Dividends and they increase the total supply of Bitcoin so Bitcoin isn't actually very scarce"
I interrupted and said that all hard forks were, were incompatible software changes with the rest of the original network.
And he replied that "Bitcoin isn't software," something about "its created by the miners," He said something really stupid about what alt-coins were, I can't even remember what it was.   ???
I don't even know what he was trying to say, made no sense.  How can you be in this space for 2 years~ and not  even know how it all works.

@_date: 2019-05-19 16:27:52
Hi there.  Your questions are questions most everyone has when they first start looking into Bitcoin.  One of the best sources of information that will answer these questions would be videos by Andreas Antonopoulos; here is his youtube channel:  [   
Bitcoin is many things to different people, so there will be disagreements to many of these answers.  
1.   We've been using digital currencies and digital payment networks for decades.  The vast majority of US dollars only exist as account entries in the databases of banks.  When you send or receive payments from your accounts with debit/credit/paypal, all they do is add/subtract a number from one account, add/subtract a number into the other account, minus a transaction fee.    
So a US Government "blockchain currency" wouldn't be that different from what we have today.  It would be vastly different from Bitcoin, however, as Bitcoin has certain properties that cannot be copied, just by copying the code.  Some entity would be required to have control over a USD Blockchain, they would be able to decide who can use it (not permisionless), which transactions can be done and can reverse or freeze transactions (not immutible, not censorship resistant), who can see and surveil transactions (not public), and I doubt non-US Citizens would be allowed to use it, so it wouldn't be global.  
A Ban on Bitcoin would be the greatest catalyst for its adoption, but its still a joke here.  The US is only 350million people in a world of nearly 8 billion people, we would just be cutting ourselves off from it.  And the reality is that actually affecting ban would be impossible.  
2. Trust in banking institutions is at one of its lowest points in history.    
Adoption will take decades.  The truth is the user experience is not there yet, and it won't be for a long time.    
3. It depends which economic theory you prescribe to.  I think Bitcoin is amazing for the reasons you listed as disadvantages;  it is a monetary policy/system that cannot be controlled or changed by person or entity.  This is a property that cannot be copied, and up to this point has not been replicated by any other cryptocurrency.  All users and participants have to play by the same rules on an equal footing.  When you have someone on top that can decide monetary policy, there will always be corruption, or someone wielding that power to the benefit of some at the expense of others.  
4. Bitcoin removes the need for a trusted third party to be in the middle of every transaction.  It already makes them obsolete.  As mentioned above, if they tried making their own "blockchain currency," it wouldn't be any different than what the current system looks like, and they would design the system so as to require the use of those financial institutions as third parties.  It honestly changes nothing and does not compete with Bitcoin.  
5. The opinion I subscribe to:  Bitcoin becoming a store of value is a significant cultural shift.  Bitcoin has to go through a speculative commodity phase to become a store of value before it can be used as a Unit of account.  There are computer science issues that need to be solved/circumvented and more layers built on top of Bitcoin before it can be used as a medium of exchange by a global population.   These issues are not unique to Bitcoin.  It all takes time, but they aren't unsolveable, and it depends on how long you mean by "soon."  The volatility has been going down over time, and will continue to go down.
