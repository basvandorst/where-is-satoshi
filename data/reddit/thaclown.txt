Shameful media by  and 'tech journalists' 
I truly think that the mainstream banking and institutions are getting scared and the dirty FUD will start.
Maybe let  and  know what you think about this.....

- never keep Bitcoin at a exchange
- buy and hold, don't trade 
- keep emotions out of it
- never invest money you can't afford to lose

Welcome to our crazy world!

I just got out of all markets and moved my BTC to a Ledger Wallet. Seems so much safer and the trading was giving me unrest... Kept looking at the price, no peace of mind. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:28:10
Yup agree, I am keeping my coins safe and sound in my Ledger Wallet! 
@_date: 2016-01-25 09:56:58
Why? it is Bitcoin related right?
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:58:55
Don't it is all a scam.....
Bitcoin is only a decentralized, powerful, free to use, unregulated store of value that is growing very vast and that has a limited supply.... USELESS
Only PAPER and OFFICIAL DIGITAL NUMBERS from a central bank that can be printed without nay restiction have REAL value... 
It's so simple....

Actually I like to think this post is funny and very true...

Add Bitcoin to this and good times ahead..

Just buy... and buy a little every day/week/month...

Just a year ago Bitcoin was just nerd-money, and used by criminals and pedophiles... A joke to any 'serious', old school investor...
Now look at this video! A very serious hedge to fiat, outperforming gold 3x and simply becoming a normal investment...

I keep 60% BTC in my Ledger Nano S Hardware Wallet (don't plan to sell those for years) 
Have 20% at polo with a Stop Loss that I move up as we go
Other 20% at Kraken with trailing Stop Loss of 4%
Every month I plan to sell 0.5-1% now just to take a little profits 
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:19:08

Expected... No! IT IS! they stil don't get it..  
@_date: 2016-12-21 09:44:49
Why not sell a little every month? like 500 USD (or whatever is a nice monthly extra but does not cut into your main stash too much)
Use if for fun things like hookers &amp; blow. 
HODL the rest. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 06:27:13
Yup... "the land of the free" LOL most Americans don't realize how absurd that statement is...

I agree, made a edit.. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 07:56:22
Depends on your situation. 
First of never buy BTC with loaned money or money you can't afford to lose.... 
I see BTC (and other crypto) as a risky alternative investment. But with pretty huge potential. 
I own some stocks, have some gold and silver, no debt and quite some crypto. 
If you have money to spend, I would generally use it roughly in this order:
*edit it all depends on how much risk you want to take of course and if you believe that BTC will be worth A LOT more in the future or not.. I you do like me then go ahead and put 5-15% of your money in Crypto*
- 1 pay off any debts, credit cards or loans (the return for having these payed off is a lot higher then any stock or crypto usually) 
- 2 get some cash in a savings account (this is your "just in case Shit happens money") 
- 3 pay off mortgage or invest in real estate 
- 4 get some stocks 
- 5 get a little gold/silver as a hedge
- 6 still got some left? BITCOIN baby!    
@_date: 2016-12-18 07:46:37
Well I would ask them to defend and explain 'normal' money or gold... 
Why do they have value? 
They won't get very far and you can show that Bitcoin is simply another store of value like gold or dollars. 
Also, can they touch the money in the bank account? When a government makes more money out of nothing it is simply created digitally... Our 'real' money today is just as  digital as Bitcoin is... Just unlimited unlike BTC.

BTC is starting the Media Phase... 
@_date: 2016-12-24 09:50:30
I do this:
- 50% of my BTC is in my Ledger Nano S Hardware wallet, safe and not touching it for years (in case BTC wil go 10.000$ +) 
- 40% is on KRAKEN exchange with a Trailing Stop Loss of 10% (a lot but I hope it won't sell any fast dumps but still sell if it REALLY dumps) 
- I sell 1 % of the 10% left after certain pushes up or milestones, just did this now, will again at 999$, 1200$, 1500$, etc (this is to make sure I take profit and gives me some cash to spend of fun stiff, if you don't use it what is the point?) 
@_date: 2016-12-18 09:25:41
Why is owning your own property a bad thing? 
Of course it depends on your country and possible tax deductions... 
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:27:59
Definition of FOMO.... 
THIS is how people lose everything.
Be careful. Don't buy BTC with money you don't have / can't afford to lose. 
My advise:
Put the BTC you have away somewhere safe. Don't touch it for a very long time, dumps will come, so will bigger pushes up. 
Buy small amounts of BTC every week and try to not get emotional about pumps and dumps... 
@_date: 2016-12-19 18:35:47
I kind of agree, but a little (I do mean 5% or so) gold silver is probably a good hedge for crazy times... 
@_date: 2016-12-25 14:58:08
Sorry to say but.. 
You sound like the exactly the type that is NOT supposed to trade... 
Nevrous, emotional and with panic. 
Just buy some BTC with money you can afford to lose and hold it for years... Don't try to predict the market, you can't. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:07:10
Congrats man, taking profit is never a bad thing!

Let me know if you have any questions, via email on the site. ICONOMI provides a easy way to buy a actively managed crypto portfolio.
I am very proud to be one of the first 12 DAA Managers in the world. “ICONOMI Welcomes the First Series of DAA Managers” 
They did a interview with me recently
“DAA Manager Insights: Menno Peter Pietersen”

Why in the world do you expect the majority of Bitcoin supporters to switch? Seriously asking becouse it makes no sense.
Bitcoin has never been widely used as money/cash is simply has not!
It is a new asset class now, a unique store of value. Amazing things are happening:
- price going up
- positive mainstream media attention
- technology upgrades like lighting network
- inner battle about blocks finally over
- Wall Street getting in (yes this is really happening and it is beyond great for all true Bitcoin holders)
Once Bitcoin has grown and developed more, both technically and in world wide acceptance it will start to become a form of money. Probably via sidechains and more new developments.
Right now, nobody needs Bitcoin to be cash! We need it to grow up first become a global accepted store of value. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:04:29
Great stuff. Another plan could be to diversify in other crypto also. I run a DAA at ICONOMI. Have a look, it is a very easy way to diversify. 
Costs are only 2,75% per year if the initial investment. A few clicks and you have a nicely blanced crypto portfolio. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:44:36
I have exactly the same. Flooded with people from high school contacting me about Bitcoin. Like 2 a day now...

@_date: 2017-11-05 05:45:35
Nice, thanks for sharing. Make some recognize that (seemingly small) amounts of money can be a lot for many people.
My advice, buy some BTC every week/month... Long term, just a few bucks you can spare. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:46:05
That is one expensive and horrible coffee.
IN A PLASTIC CUP!
My god America, get some manners....
@_date: 2017-05-25 05:49:33
Thanks for sharing, sadly many have stories like you... 
My advice buy and HODL and diversity! 
Why only hold BTC or XRP? It's just risky, and you will mis out on many good moves... 
Get a nice mix! I have and HODL:
- ICN
- ANT
- ETH
- BTC
- WAVES
- ICNX
- INCNT
- WBB
Try to ignore the ups and downs, don't try to predict the market, you can't... 
I have a plan and sticking to it: sell 1% of my total (that week) crypto holdings for EURO every week. 
This way I take small bits of profit and stay in crypto long term. 
Crypto in general is booming diversity, hold and be rich.... Without stress.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:31:10
*why are the only options for so many of you: SELL ALL or HODL ALL?*
Makes no sense.. Take some profits on the way up man... Sell small amounts every week/month
I have so much profits, figured out what I do to both cash out a little and go long on crypto in General. 
*I sell 1% of my crypto holdings value every week to euro.*
The rest I don't trade and just HODL and hope crypto goes truly mainstream.   
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:34:52
Sell 1-3% every week to euro / USD... 
You will take nice little bits of profit on the way up, but also Hodl most of your value. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:23:31
Jeez so.... Simple... 
NEVER KEEP CRYPTO ON A EXCHANGE! 
Especially not on a scammy one like BTC-E... 
sorry for you, but your own fault for taking the risk.
