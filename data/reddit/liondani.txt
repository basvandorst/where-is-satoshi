bitUSD gives stability over Bitcoin and all other Altcoins...
you have all benefits of 2 world's... FIAT and Cryptospace...
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:12:15
seems like bitshares have a lot o haters... :(
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:57:06
You can crosspost your post at steemit that will stay forever at the blockchain!!! No censorship and big exposure to the crypto world. The impact will be huge for them.

just high standard deviation...

It is not only based on POS but is using Delegates as well...
Actualy it is a DPOS system. Both POS+DELEGATES are unbeatable!
See the last Dry Runs and test it by your self on

and then ethereum will arise... and goverments will support it... my nightmare will come true?

The problem is not the 80 to 40 bytes...
The problem is that next year it will be maybe 20 or 10 or 0...
In short, the devs can destroy counterparty-like projects when ever they want or whenever somebody gives them the order...

if you are not paying for electricity make a favor to you and buy yourself mining equipment... even taking a credit doing that!

Read the whole article and maybe you will choose bitGOLD over bitUSD... or a basket of bitAssets (available on bitshares... and  they are collaterized!)
@_date: 2014-11-03 12:46:07
Great opprtunitys on bitshares network. It's the future.The brightest/greatest minds will get there finaly and will get paid from the blockchain directly with bitAssets!!!

To prevent this attacks BitShares DNS would be the ultimate answer!!! They will start at 21 August 2014 !!!!!!!

I said it before weeks... when jail is close enough, Karpeles will find the "lost" coins... He is the luckiest guy on the community... thats the only scenario... I always said that RPG players are the most creative players on earth... Was a good try mister K, thumbs up :)
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:13:29
Most of altcoins will be die even without an attack! 
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:17:54
the security that provides bitshares blockchain with 1 confirmation in 5 seconds is greater than bitcoins security with 6 confirmations in 1 hour ,check DPOS blockchain technology ;)

You can buy just right now bitROUBLE on bitshares decentralized exchange in almost 10sec...
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:47:08
after mtgox @ recent bitstamp issues &amp; and who knows which one comes next, a decetralized exhange like bitshares should appeal reasonably more to the bitcoin community than it has in past. I can of course understand your reaction since you have the impression it's another altcoin...Thats definetely not the case... if you spend just a few minutes of your time to understand the technology behind bitshares I am sure you will take a different approach.
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:57:10
The best choice is bitshares in my opinion because you can buy on a decentralized exchange any sort of bitAssets you want with 300% collateral that controls the blockchain and not some centralized company using IOU's... You can even **buy SWISS FRANCS (CHF) and take a positive yield** keeping only your deposits !!! If you make a deposit on a Swiss Bank right now, you must pay a negative yield from 0.25%-0.75% !!! So what is better?
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:13:21
actually a mobile wallet is in the testing phase  ;)
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:41:47
Get involved with bitGOLD then...
@_date: 2015-01-05 21:42:11
the answer to your question is here :
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:37:52
That's exactly the reason why we need a decentralized crypto exchange market !!!
@_date: 2015-01-08 10:06:08
It was better than bitstamp before the hack... it's definitely now also, isn't it?  :)
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:37:18
and when you win the lottery... play again :)

I was concerned when my holdings where 10X... They can grab now whatever is left...
