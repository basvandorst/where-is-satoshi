There we go again!

As for today I've made 108% by trading. And it's  not sell then wait for the dip. I only sell when I'm almost sure it will fall. Even 100 dollars fall can make a lot of money if you count how many time you can repeat it with the current state of how volatile bitcoin is. I just make sure that if I don't rebuy instantly I get bitcoins back even on lose. IMO key to good day trading is safe spread trade.

Well. He has way more better nickname

Just as biggest whales and Satoshi can control and fuck us at ANY time.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:12:51
Few hours ago there were single output transactions with 40+ UUSD fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:21:54
If you'd watched Euro gdax you could see exacly the same rise, then crash of site. At some moment bitcoin was worth only 700 euro less than usd (around 3k usd difference). At some point people started putting sale orders at 23. 23 fucking thousands of euro per bitcoin.

No. I meant 100 -&gt; 208%. Over like last two weeks. Flash crashes are hard to predict and  NEVER EVER TAKE PART IN FIRST PART OF FLASH CRASH. Trying to join crash is THE WORST IDEA. The only way to sell your btc is via market order at it may not be processed instantly (got burnt once - lost almost all of my trading gains) and you will have to rebuy at high. However, when you see flash crash just set sell order like 100 bucks below previous price. I guarantee it will bounce back, fill your order than go all the way down. Sometimes even twice. And you can try to spread trade at the very bottom of second part of flash crash but its hella high reward high risk (spread is sometimes over 70 - and that can make you alot of money in under one minute)
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:42:17
But how do you drop transactions. Is there any kind of "best before" date? Most of those transactions appeard after August fork and were called spam transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:56:34
ATM  there is at least 22k transactions priced higher than yours. Be prepared to wait
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:29:11
Even almost every 100+ will be fit into the very next block
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:26:42
Do we still have tip bot?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:14:19
Ver?  Does it ring a bell? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:38:00
Almost all important exchanges were standing strong behind 2x proposal - centralization of the network
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:03:04
Thanks. I see it clear now. Not only it does not show more than 500MB but also MB counter is broken and shows around 220MB while mempool is almost 1GB now
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:19:54
It is. You can refill you your phone and read stuff on yells (just make sure its .mainet). 
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:02:06
I don't like coinbase but holy molly gdax is awesome. I ve been looking around for a better exchange to day trade but nothing has come close to gdax 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:14:38


THE BEST tip. ALWAYS think twice before selling btc. 
Also it's good to avoid tunnel vision
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:28:26
It's not even that hard to arange. Very first players on bitcoin market were often markets and many of them posted on bitcointalk. Of course there are also people that joined later with lots of cash but those early adopters are easy to find
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:09:10
Honestly? I have no idea. It is so tempting to play and yet, deep down something tells me to quit
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:54:23
Made my day :p
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:17:47
BTW. those flash buys (how is flash crash when it goes up instead of down) are amazing opportunities. Unless you watch andreas and have two tabs with exchanges open. Then your laptop may not survive that and instead of grabbing free milibitcoin you get to reboot and watch it all happen on phone :(.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:16:17
How durable are they? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:08:19
I believe they can take every segwit tx and then 1MB of old txs. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:16:59
A lot of movement is happening right now. Over 37k tx with 140sats/byte
@_date: 2018-09-28 19:22:12
In theory the lowest you can go is 1 sat for the entire transaction
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:11:14
As soon as it becomes a threat we may just change rules. I bet that when we put  6 blocks every hour at stake we will be able to do "right choice" 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:32:06
Each block contains currently up to 2200-2600 tx - at the time of writing, next block found will be full of 300+ txes.
HOWEVER, if you use Segwit adress there is almost 100% chance to get included in next block for very low fee. That's because it does not cost anything for the miners to put your transaction in their block and there is very little of segwit txes.
If everyone would switch to Segwit tomorrow we would clean nonspam txes in less than 7 hours.

It took two years to create a thesis on md5 collisions and 8 more years to actually perform one on the hash. Yet it's still not fully broken. We are nowhere near that right now and crypto world increased in last 20years. 
Our civilization  would be very fucked as soon as someone starts tempering with sha on quantum computers. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:13:18
Tweet them on  and call the phoneline. Also there is r/coinbase that will definitelly upvote this and give further advices.

He didnt say cash inflates 7%. M2!=cash

First, someone has to come up with 100k different names. After that the power woudl have to move from bitcoin to altcoins. Without hashrate there is no mining(unless difficulty level is lowered but noone with just a percent of brain would trust this fraud). And of course altcoins are worthless if there is noone to exchange it into bitcoin or fiat. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:53:31
It may allow hackers to bypass security. Right now it is estimated that half of world computing power may not break hack blockchain. But no worries. If something like that happend internet would be  dommed.

QE affects MB, then its up to bank if they want to increase M1 or not (or central bank's policy but they can only decrease M1). There is big difference between printing and QE
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:40:46
QE != printing money
ready to get downvoted
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:26:26
Ohhh. Didnt think of that. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:41:36
Apparently they plan to make stops on 7% and 13% too. Just few minuts of no trading. If i get that correctly people will just gather on the other side on live exchanges and literally destroy cme during stops... 
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:41:14
Why do people complain about fees? I'm buying btc on gdax without fees and when I withdrew 30 euro there was only 0.15euro fee.

I missed 3600 dip with just hours but last time my deposit got throught within 2days

Euro exchange on gdax dropped from 9300 to 7,1k. Then within next 2minutes from 8700 to 7600. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:30:36
Deposit into Coinbase then go to gdax.com. It is coinbase exchange platform. You can buy there with only 0,25% fee or set a buy order to avoid all fees. Yes, u can sell them via Coinbase but its better to go to gdax (same case).
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:53:43
What happens when it reaches 20%? Will they call it a day and stop trading for a day? If so its going to be funny times as soon as it happens.
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:22:39
your addresses are visible on coinbase, you can use any of them and get credited
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:13:58
coinbase opened when btc was just above 10 euro
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:53:25
China could ban bitcoin

It means that we might have never had a block full of in currency payments. Just speculative transactions between wallets and exchanges  or spam

no fee for withdrawing BTC, not sure how but for fiat but 26£ costed me like 0.12£ of bank fee
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:45:13
Because there are many things that those fees cover? Maintaining those wallets isnt easy and free. Look up Binance CEO tweet about latest 
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:10:37
Low fees and good in deepth chart

How did it go?
@_date: 2018-07-27 22:11:35
Its illegal to own usd and use it in Venezuela 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:52:21
Its mostly between exchanges to cash out dollars 
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:29:53
They locked doors for 3 days and when people were finally let it they could only withdraw old notes that  werent legal tender any longer. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:56:32
Well. I don't have access to my funds, they won't update app, there is nothing explaining why I don't see my funds so I guess that whatever was used to fund channel Is lost. Someone said that it may take a bit of time to get my funds but we will see
@_date: 2018-04-05 19:53:26
Despite having enough funds I keep getting "not enough funds" error.
Anyone help?
@_date: 2018-04-08 07:13:23
How long did it take to close channel? I'm waiting 2days and it's still orange
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:28:18
In this case exchanges went to far! Bitmex deleveraged many positions
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:34:36
In channel they are
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:51:57
I have seed so if my channel gets closed and nothing breaks ill just use it
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:34:23
Forced. But it seems already 2 days 
@_date: 2018-04-10 10:40:24
Thanks!

There is a bug that corrupts funds. This app is not working properly. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:28:44
So RN I have 30$ worth of BTC that can't be recovered. Made BTC more scare for you guys
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:11:33
Exactly. I'm a "tech savy" and OK with computers but without guidance I can't do anything.
