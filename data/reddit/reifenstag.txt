I'm a dev who finds Bitcoin very interesting on a technological level, but all the infighting,viability of projects in the space, etc. make it kind of unappealing to put a lot of time (and therefore money) into. Just my two cents.

You're talking about people trying to time the market, a subset of market participants.  Presumably under EMT big players have enough long and short orders in to accurately reflect the price with all current information.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:25:52
bro you are not as smart as you think you are
@_date: 2016-01-18 05:29:26
It doesn't matter whether current participants know it - for something to be effectively priced in, all it requires is that one sufficiently large participant is aware of it.  And you can certainly assume that one does.
@_date: 2016-01-18 05:44:42
That has nothing to do with how it is priced *right now*

I own BTC for the utility it provides and the technology that it is built on, not because I think it would be a successful investment vehicle.  I don't put in more than I'd be willing to lose.  Deciding to dedicate some of the time that I currently use for working and making money in a risky venture is way different than owning some BTC.  If BTC tanks, I'll lose a couple grand.  If I decided to work at a BTC company for a few years and it tanked, I'd be out exponentially more.

You should read up on efficient market theory.

Sorry that you're not mature enough to be able to deal with criticism, but don't assume the rest of us are as well.  I own bitcoin and realize it's and it's communities faults - and sometimes when the top 5 posts are stupid memes and false news reports about how so-and-so is considering accepting bitcoin, you can get a much more cogent discussion of bitcoin on buttcoin.  also, how creepy is it that you went through my post history? seriously.

not really a big bitcoin fan but learning python, this is cool
@_date: 2015-07-21 00:34:03
Yeah dude you definitely have a better grip of things than warren buffet

no matter how many mental gymnastics you do, the law will consider it fraud.
@_date: 2016-02-03 18:22:15


and if they move large amounts of it, they almost certainly *will* be sitting in a jail cell
@_date: 2016-02-11 16:48:06
can you explain some more?
@_date: 2016-02-10 16:33:20
i think you're way over-estimating how much real people care about bitcoin

Perhaps if losing around $~1k is a "massive setback" for you you should save up for another year before trying to start a business.

@_date: 2015-09-18 05:45:06
that's an interesting position considering that various governments have already successfully linked bitcoins to people in dozens and dozens of cases
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:38:35
are you saying that bitcoin isn't wrought with fraud
@_date: 2015-11-06 21:25:38
i hope not, but knowing btc, it's eminently possible
@_date: 2015-03-28 03:28:05
this article is both bad and wrong. gas prices are not "going fucking crazy," they're in a volatile price period because there are a lot of complex factors at play and price discovery is taking a little while.  
"the fed has it's head up it's ass" is almost more false now than at any time in history. we have a data dependent fed and that's a good thing. the bull market has been strong for 18+ months, a correction is due and rates had to go up sometime. 
is biotech a pretty pricey sector right now? yes. but that's how a market works - the overvalued will bust out and the  rest will pick up the pieces. that's how the market works - and it is good.

you'll be lucky if 50cad is all you lose from messing with bitcoin sonny boy
@_date: 2015-10-09 19:47:29
Lmao if you say anything bad about bitcoin people like this will stalk your post history
