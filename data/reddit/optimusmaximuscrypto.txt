Ya exactly that. If you go on CMC, anything outside the top 100 (some people say even top 50) is considered higher risk due to the smaller market cap.
If that market cap grows, those gains in terms of % will be higher than if you bought ETH for example.

BCH is the legit Bitcoin. 
Learn your facts: it’s faster, cheaper, and has a ROGER VER.
BTC has some mysterious Satoshi character, what a joke. 
Edit: this is sarcasm you noobs. BTC all the way! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:05:46
He’s a greedy psychopath dude, I don’t blame him. If you made 100s of millions off BTC and had the chance to do it again with BCH, you’d probably take it. He sees hundreds of millions at his finger tip and we can’t fault him for taking it. In fact, some the community members here are actively feeding him.

Hello. Don’t switch to BCH you waste man.

He doesn’t have WTC or else he’d be more mad over the loss. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:23:50
If you spend and then rebuy the exact amount of BTC you just spent you don’t lose out anything. You just support the overall ecosystem. 
You are correct though, BTC has changed from a currency to more of a store of value for most people. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:37:48
One thing is for sure in the market. Everything goes down, but not everything goes back up. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 14:55:05
Didn’t take a genius to notice that one lol. It’s quite amusing though 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:18:30
But does WTC have volatility?
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:57:34
All of those are on the ledger. He can’t be hacked.

It’s so funny how the older and “wiser” investors willingly link the dip to the “kids” of crypto exiting the market. 
Glad to know the millennials have billions of USD in influence, seems they play a legitimately crucial part in the development of the market overall ����

How are you going to ensure that the BTC wasn’t acquired illegally? 
@_date: 2018-10-19 18:24:36

Why do people want a 100% BTC ETF? Just fight for adding BTC to the NYSE or NASDAQ. The point of an ETF is diversity and perhaps a more popular use-based crypto ETF would be one that encompasses all supply chain orientated tokens.

Convert to BCH if you want to give it away to charity ��
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:52:18
Week old shill accounts lmfao �� I’ve probably lurked on here longer than you’ve known about crypto. 
What you fail to realize is I’m not “shilling” a coin here, I’ve never even mentioned one. I am letting OP know that his money is better gambled because of how low the actual FIAT amount is. 
BTC is king and will remain king for some time but with the general market cap growing exponentially, OP will see better % ROI on small cap coin investments. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:56:14
This is exactly why no one can take this space seriously in the financial sector.
What gives USD value is the fact that people spend it. If this community is a bunch of hodlers then the ecosystem is going to crash and the value will pop (ref. Bubble).
There’s nothing wrong with buying BTC, there’s a problem with not spending it.
Spend it where it’s accepted to expand its acceptance and then immediately  buy back what you spent.
I’m tired of people just throwing money into this market and pronouncing coins names wrong. It’s lite-coin not lit-coin. Completely unrelated to you, but had to include in rant.
Blindly investing into something that you DO NOT understand, even basically, is just gambling. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:26:32
The $100,000 VAPE lmfao �� hope it smokes well for that future cost LOL.
In all seriousness though enjoy, it’s good to spend BTC it supports the ecosystem. Just make sure you rebuy the amount you spent immediately 
@_date: 2019-02-09 03:27:02

By the 52 week time from this current point BTC will be worth $20,000+. It’s more like the road to .5 BTC, but hey the best time to buy was yesterday and the second best time is today!

That is an awesome point. Hard to do but still awesome!

ATH means All Time High. My bad, should have just spelled it out lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:59:55
Oh please, there are so many great projects out there that do not get recognition because of thinking like yours.
Cryptocurrency is revolutionary and the blockchain technology far extends past the BTC post. 
I’ve never instructed OP on what to do, hell I didn’t even list or “shill” a coin. I simply offered another perspective.
OP may want high returns for high risk or OP might want low reward for low risk, but they should be entitled to know both options and their relative strengths and weaknesses.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:32:46
That’s odd QuadrigaCX hasn’t been known in the community to be doing this to its members.
I guess that’s why they say don’t keep a large amount on exchanges.
Nothing you can do OP but wait for them to respond to your support ticket and take it from there, sorry. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:06:02
Not necessarily, they’ll just be linked to BCH over BTC
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:06:51
I agree. In order to maintain profitable interest from their shareholders they have to ensure each quarterly report is better than their last! However, they should potentially develop a software that catches a company attempting to be the first result on the page by mimicking very closely the actual top result. The only reason someone would attempt that would be for fraud and no legitimate company would do so.
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:29:07
Man this shit is nothing like traditional stocks and bonds. I was in that market as well prior to joining crypto. This market is crazy in terms of fluctuations. Throw the TA out of the window, buy the rumours and sell the news. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:13:39
That’s a little bit odd. Has it at least showed “unconfirmed”?
You can check the blockchian on blockchain info to see what’s going on with the transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:44:34
Are you just getting into crypto? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:15:36
Clearly passed away. No wallet movement is indicative of this. No one hodls that hard, not even the great Satoshi. There is however one individual who worked “one on one” with Satoshi but sadly passed away ;)

Such a good doc. Hope you enjoyed it as I did.
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:10:42
First off, welcome to the 21 million club! 
Now store that BTC on a nano ledger S and you’ll be safe. It’ll also help you keep a steady hand because it won’t be so easily accessible to sell. Never keep this amount of $ on an exchange - Mt. Gox as a reminder of the potential danger.
40% of your savings is a little high I just hope it’s an amount you are ok to lose. With your annual income it should be fine. 
Once you save up a little more for investments, try diversifying your portfolio into some other alt-coins. I’m not going to shill anything because this sub does enough of that but when the time is right DYOR and pick 5 or so other coins. This will diversify your portfolio and keep it healthy. 
Cheers and happy hodling!
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:17:26
I don’t think at the point prior to the authentication they knew the full value of the coins. They probably just wanted to see if the gold was real and then were shocked to realize the value the actual coins held beyond just gold. Needless to say it would have been better to be safe than sorry and only bring 1 regardless.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:06:26
Transfer that $75 of BTC into the smallest market cap most high risk alt coin you can find. You’ll either be handsomely rewarded or you’ll lose $75.
$75 in BTC will turn to $150 maybe $200 in 1 year... it’s not worth it brother. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:26:52
Sell at $2600, right before the ATH. Chances are it won’t push past that resistance and it will drop shortly after if it does or doesn’t push past that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:08:12
No way it goes to $8.5K. There is absolutely no FUD. It’s going to keep going up with minor corrections in the hundreds.
People are adopting on a massive scale. Celebrities endorsing it and everything. 
Happy hodling early adopters, this is the mass adoption phase. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:10:22
Don’t worry about the selling part. Almost any exchange will wire the money directly to your CAD acct.
I remember hearing that Quad, the CAD exchange, doesn’t let you sell. It that’s true it’s irrelevant. As I stated above there are various other exchanges that will be happy to give you FIAT for your BTC.
Edit: you may need a USD acct in your CAD bank but that’s easy to set up.
@_date: 2018-11-10 03:48:56
