Seconding this, but my beef is not with support, it's with their dubious processes. Their support staff seems overwhelmed by some recent major operational screw up.
So Coinbase had some system issues, and &gt;S$1.2k went missing from my account on 25 March 2017. Contacted support, they emailed me a couple of times to assure me my funds are "secure", but don't explain why:
1) my funds have been held hostage for more than 20 days if they are secure. A fund transfer is a straight forward process.
2) they closed my account after the funds went missing.
Support can only say whatever they're told to say, and it seems they're not being told much, because the emails they send are basically empty of real content.
To those who're defending Coinbase just because they're lucky enough not to have suffered any issues, well, they'll get what's coming to them.

33 days later I'm still getting the copypasta :)

Please let me know if your issue gets attended to. I've been out &gt;S$1.2k for 20 days and counting.

3 months...... we need a good review system for crypto exchanges.

Ouch. I worry for you. Hopefully adding a bank account is more easily accomplished than my issue.

Any chance the buy/ sell limits for customers in Singapore can be increased beyond $3000/ day? Reading FAQs and emailing support aren't helpful in the least bit.

I had to liquidate another 18 ETH because the money from the sale of the first didn't come through. If I'd kept the second 18 ETH I'd have been able to sell them now at a different price.

I've always liked itbit.com, no idea why their market share is so tiny.

igot lost a sum of my money when I requested for withdrawal! It's stated as deposited on their end but I never received it in my bank account. It's been 12 days, and their customer support takes ages to reply. What recourse do I have? Any legal entities in Australia I can make a formal complaint to??

Their claims need a closer look. 2 points of contention: 1) Does the FDIC insurance kick in on event of Coinbase's partner bank's failure or Coinbase failure (insolvency or whatever)? Is Coinbase considered a bank? 2) Does the $250,000 insurance amount apply to each individual Coinbase account or some general accounts held by Coinbase? If Coinbase holds 3 "custodial accounts", = $750,000 insurance to be divided by, what, 1 million Coinbase accounts, that won't be much coverage for each. I'm unfamiliar but people with bigger stakes should really look into this. What they have on their website is terribly vague.

We need some sort of consumer review system.
