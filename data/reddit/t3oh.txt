Where should I create one? I really don't trust those paper Wallet generator sites.
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:33:32
How is it? Is it better than Coinbase? 
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:36:18

Coinbase has a pretty strong security. And they've seem very trustable with their reviews and the reputation. 
But, I think if you are really worried about your BTC being stolen, you should create your own wallet.
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:41:15
Nice! I'll take a look at it.
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:35:43
How is the security compared to CB? Also, any wait time when purchasing BTC?
@_date: 2015-12-05 22:55:18
Thanks but, I already printed one out. I'm just going to put about $100 worth of BTC in the paper wallet, and going to create a USB drive for the rest of my BTC.
@_date: 2015-12-05 09:50:38
Thanks! I'll create one right now!
@_date: 2016-03-07 05:45:56
I like the price, but I want it to be more secure.
@_date: 2016-03-07 02:29:37
I was considering it, but it relies on the computer, correct?
@_date: 2016-03-07 02:30:09
So Trezor has an app as well? 
@_date: 2016-03-07 05:33:02
I want a little bit more security on my Bitcoins. But, I like the price on it.
@_date: 2016-03-06 22:06:26
To Coinbase or away?
@_date: 2016-03-07 02:30:39
I'm currently buying it on Circle because the fees are more reasonable.
@_date: 2016-03-07 08:02:54
@_date: 2016-03-07 15:20:49
Do you have to have the Trezor at all times?
@_date: 2016-03-07 08:03:50
I know, they raise the BTC prices a bit correct. I also like using it because I can get the Bitcoins instantly.
@_date: 2016-03-06 22:05:20
Thanks. Yes I do in fact purchase Bitcoins from Circle, and trade multiple times a day. Will it be a hassle to do it through Trezor?
@_date: 2016-03-07 05:54:11
Sorry using an Android :/
@_date: 2016-03-07 05:32:02
What do you mean?
@_date: 2015-08-01 03:48:28
Yeah, I use Preev to exchange. But, I also want the chart as well.
@_date: 2015-08-01 03:52:36
Lucky you! I would hold on to that.
@_date: 2015-07-31 02:22:54
Hmm.. Bitcoin Wisdom is actually kind of cool. Might use that! :)
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:56:04
How long have you had that account? Check your emails, see if LocalBitcoin send you anything about your account.
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:45:47
So, you had the account for a while? 
Did you ever provide any identity verification? 
@_date: 2015-07-10 09:46:47
It was almost $300. I'm going to check again in the morning. :)
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:38:10
@_date: 2015-07-23 02:43:36
No, because you told them your account was compromised, and they thought that it was your IP that compromised your account. Also, give them 24 hours to reply. See if they'll reply by then, since it's probably night time for them.
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:22:48
Isn't Purse Amazon? Also, I've checked out Purse, they have a high rate.
@_date: 2015-07-23 02:28:39
Sounds like they probably blacklisted your IP. Because they think that your IP was the one who compromised the account. That's why your brother's account was frozen as well. I suggest you contacting LocalBitcoins, and to unblacklist your IP. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 06:05:54
@_date: 2015-07-22 18:55:47
Well the only place I can think of is CoinBase. There fees are only 1%. But they only accept bank accounts. But since you're 17, you can open a high school checking account.
@_date: 2015-07-10 09:51:02
People are ditching LTC
@_date: 2015-07-25 05:49:08
I don't even know whats going on anymore .-.
@_date: 2015-07-22 19:53:31
Or you can ask your parent/guardian to purchase them for you. Other than that, there are no where else you can get them at a 3% rate.
@_date: 2015-07-23 03:09:09
I'm not really sure about this, since I don't use LocalBitcoins to often.
But, check out maybe you might find something there.
@_date: 2015-07-26 09:00:30
This would be interesting. I would love to find out where one of his ATM location will be located.
