Difficulty doesn't take into account price according to this post. The correlation between price and difficulty is due to the behaviour of the miners.

The reason FIAT is useful is that the issuer promises stable inflation. To do so, they have to collect price data all over the country to create a price index and then adjust the amount of fiat they add to circulation or remove. Bitcoin won't really ever be able to achieve low inflation stability, we will always have to relate bitcoin prices relative to a stable currency and price index.
It would be nice if bitcoin could relate itself to a price index to increase price stabilty. In times of inflation (due to bitcoin's value crashing) less bitcoin would be created until it recovers, at which point the algorithm would return to its normal rate.
The problem then becomes to decentralize Price indexes, which I have no idea how it can be done effectively.

What I'm trying to get at is that the value of FIAT comes from all the man power that is put behind building the price index

Greeks are getting poorer because they consume more than they produce, which they've always been doing.
Greece's problem is that it is one of the most corrupt government and joining the EU opened up the flood gate of being able to accumulate ridiculous amount of debt without having to face much inflation. Usually when a country issue its own currency and its government is misspending too much, it will face a lot of inflation (internal force), but since the zone covered by the euro covers far more than Greece, any misspending by one government gets diluted to other countries so the misspending can only be stopped by  rulings from the EU (external forces) instead of internal forces.

There isn't enough cash for every millionaires to own a million in cash either.
millionaires don't hold as much cash as you think, they even have negative cash balances a lot of the time and leverage assets such as companies and real estates to increase their liquidity.

Speculation happens because of the belief that one day it won't be about speculation anymore but a genuine need for bitcoin to conduct transactions. The more obvious it becomes, the more speculative buyers will jump on it. I'm not saying in 2 years we will have peak adoption, but it will be obvious at a mainstream level that adoption will skyrocket in the future.

The next bullrun will happen with larger scale adoption where a large amount of bitcoins are necessary for economic transactions to be conducted and it could easily take 2 years. For now it's just the last chance to accumulate.
