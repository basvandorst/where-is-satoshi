People freak out about the term bubble, which is really just an exponential period of growth followed by a large correction, crypto may very well be a bubble at this time.  People like to compare this to the .com bubble, thats fair, lets take a look at the facts... in 2000 the nasdaq bubble popped, and it went from a total market cap of $2.9 trillion to $1.2 trillion, which is an amazing 60% down turn.  So the bubble popped right? All tech companies died? Obviously not,  the nasdaq is still on of the premiere exchanges in the world and today has a market cap of over $8 trillion... point being, this thing may correct hard at some point, in the long run, crypto is not going away and this stuff is changing the world.  Similar to how tech companies have in the last 2 decades.

Fact is bitcoin is the hottest right now because yes it was the first and its getting a massive amount of media coverage, price increase is massive and everyone wants in... 10 years from now will it be the top coin? Idk, no one knows, also I don’t care, this is not a 10 year contract to own bitcoin here, its the hot coin right now so lets ride the wave and make some money, if that changes, then you buy up the next hot coin.  We dont have to be married to these coins, we are here to make money yes?  Or maybe thats just me...
Edit: of course people will hate on me saying this, but if you think you are not here to make money, you are lying to yourself.

Lets not forget gold was once a currency, far more recently than 700BC.  Is bitcoin speculative? Of course it is, and so is gold... just because gold value is stable does mean that its not speculative.  As you mentioned gold has been around as a currency and store of value for a long time, bitcoin is brand new and its market cap is  peanuts compared to gold, which is one of the reasons that it fluctuations so much... as bitcoins marketcap grows the price will stabilize. And it most certainly has evolved, it was meant to be a currency, however its real world use has become a store of value, and i think it has a bright futures as such.

Congrats on your success, however to be honest, this post is a little ridiculous.  Of course the IRS would track investment transactions with mutual funds.  I am not sure why people are making this such a big deal, have you never invested in the stock market?  I have since I was in college and every year I include my trade activity while reporting my income to the IRS, crypto is no different.  This is not some plot to screw the crypto community, this is the law for all investment income... now if you have not made any trades this year, then there is no taxable transaction so you have nothing to worry about.  However when ever you do sell btc, you will need to pay your taxes on gains, just like any other asset you invest in, including mutual funds.  Not sure there any need for legal representation in this processes, I am a CPA and honestly the tax law for crypto is pretty straight forward, find a CPA who understands it and you will have no worries going forward. Good luck.

Btc has evolved as a store of value, there is nothing wrong with that and it has a bright future as such.  Btc’s fees are certainly lower than transaction fees for buying gold (gold as a store of value, not jewelry), and no one is looking to buy coffee with gold.

The chart has gone fully vertical and its very difficult to set a support near this price.  Since segwit the alts were growing rapidly and we are starting to see that money flow into bitcoin which is to be expected, some of which surely long term holdings and some will be short term holdings... this naturally drives up the price which brings a lot of new money, which will all dump btc at the first sign of a price decrease.  Easy answer is that at some point we will see a correction, at what point will we have that? Who knows... in my opinion we are not going below $4k... however if we do, the nearest support line I can tell is around $2,500-$2,750 - so that could easily be the bottom.

Its funny that you bring up the value of gold, Ill ask you this, what is the value of gold based on?  Obviously gold is extremely valuable, simply because we have assigned a value to it as a store of wealth.  And in its simplest form, this is why bitcoin has value, because we have assigned it such as a new virtual store of wealth.

This post seems a little odd from a holder since 2013... I have been in since 2014 and this is nothing new and have become a cyclical cycle.  This pump will last through the fork and then there will be a correction.  This has happened many times since 2013 and will most likely continue... btc always rebounds and if anything we just need to become accustom to this volatility...  I am a long time “HODLer” and thats not gonna change - so lets not worry and sit back and enjoy the ride... both up and down the rollercoaster

I didn’t down vote you, I just responded, but not sure why you care so much about a downvote, its just reddit... and if thats true than thats fine, I was wrong - but that does not change the fact bitcoins value comes from the intrinsic value which the market gives it as a store of wealth, which is similar to gold.

So most bitcoin exchanges will not let you trade large sums of money without gathering personal information, unlike the old days.  So for example, if you are using coinbase, they will know who you are and there wont be real anonymity.  That being said, if you make a withdrawal and deposit the money in the bank, it is perfectly legal and yea it is taxable.

Actually when ever you exchange currency, meaning even if you sell btc for eth, you have created a taxable event.  According to current US tax law.

Just wanted to share
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:57:17
So I am in the US, so I am not sure if there are any differences, however Speaking for how The process has worked for me... yea you can send money from coinbase directly to your bank account pretty easily.  The bank should know that the money is coming from coinbase and it was used for investing, which is some of the information you will need to provide coinbase.  In terms of tax, coinbase does not withhold anything (at least in the US, but I dont think anywhere), and it would be up to you to pay the taxes.  This is my experience in the US anyway. Hope that helps, good luck!

This is the difference in the buy/sell orders which are posted on GDAX (coinbase exchange), this is perfectly normal, remember you are not buying from or selling to coinbase, they are just the middle man and make their money on the fees they charge for the trade.  And as someone else pointed out, use gdax to trade, its lower in fees.  
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:16:41
This is how that will go... the price will get to 2550 and you will sell, but it will keep going and hit new all time highs, hype will build, demand will rise and it will move on passed 3000 and you will kick yourself for selling and post about it on reddit and someone will say the price is going to $10k, so you will buy back in and then.... boom, price will crash and you will be right back here.... so back to my original point - HOLD, HOLD and HOLD. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:07:44
Not sure how you would break even asap, and obviously buying at a lower price to lower your basis always makes sense if you believe it the asset and have the money to spend, if thats your case, then I would think it makes sense to buy more.

Thats not true at all, there are many other altcoins that have very useful applications.  Besides bitcoin you should 100% own ether (eth) assuming you have probably heard of this.  They are the 2 leaders of the crypto space, though contrary to what many believe ether has vastly different applications than bitcoin does.  Besides those 2 there are many others altcoins, some are shit and some are the "fuel" for phenomenal companies with industry disrupting technology.  You should do your own due diligence on which company's you choose to invest in.  With that said I will throw out my absolute favorite altcoin, which is Digibyte (DGB), they have been around for a few years now and are really starting to gain some tractions, plus they are dirt cheap at around 1 cent a coin currently.  They have big things happening this summer and we all (the digibyte community) are hoping for big things!  Good luck!

Digibyte!!!!! Extremely underpriced right now with a lot going on.  Very legit company with real world applications already in place, take a look at the video below and do some research.  BIG things coming this summer!!!

First off you should relax, its $500, you should not be investing money you are not prepares to lose, especially in bitcoin, which has consistently proven to be highly volatile. Besides relaxing, you should HOLD, HOLD and HOLD.  DONT go all in, this will prevent the panic and keep you from selling at the wrong time, build up a position slowly, this is a long term play.  Hype just drove up the price to new highs, thanks to a vast amount of new interest and new buyers (like you I am guessing), but there NEEDED to be a price correction, that type of growth is not sustainable, seems like we are settling around $2,000, however would not be surprised if we came down a bit more.  But lets not panic, just HOLD and I will see you at the bank ��

I was not suggesting to go all in, personally I have been buying btc steadily for the last 18 months and ether for the last 6.  Agreed that you must build a position slowly, however my point was that this is a cyclical market and you cant continue to buy on the peak and sell on the trough.  Now that there has been a well needed correction, in my opinion this is a good time to buy.  Good luck everyone ��

I think we are both freely using the word "crash", but that is not what happened here.  This is far from a crash, this was simply a price correcting, sell off, pull back - how ever you want to describe it, there was hyper demand which drove the price at unsustainable rate.  This "crash" was coming and honestly it was easy to predict and many btc gurus did predict it.  HOWEVER we are still over $2,000!!!! Just 2 months ago I was buying btc for under $1,000 - thats 100% in 2 months!! We were pushing 300% - which is insane. So yes it sucks that you bought at the peak, but you will be fine in the long run.

The entire Digibyte network is a phenomenal business, SO much more real word application to their produces than 99% of other crypto, and they are already making great movement in several different spaces.  I am also surprised they are still so unknown, but maybe a good thing, buy up coins for cheap while you can!!

Not sure I would agree it is a joke, its a good idea with legit tech to back it up.  Yes cpusage failed, however the concept is overly going to help people save/make money, does not seem like a joke to me. Additionally its worth noting that Golem as raised almost 300x the capital that cpusage did at this stage in their operations.

Short memory? Wasn't it just a few months ago when we were in this same situation with the whole Bitcoin U ordeal.  People paniced and sold, price went from $1,200 to $900, bitcoin was dead they said.....

I never said I liked ripple, I personally don't and don't own ripple.  Just not sure how it would be considered a scam, certainly one of the most legitimate alt coins out there at the moment, IMO.

first off congrats! And you should absolutely diversify, like in any investment.  However NO ONE can tell you where bitcoin or ether will be in 5 years.  However ether has had a hell of a run the last couple months and IMO there is a very bright future, I would strongly recommend at the least you buy ether.  Some others I would recommend are as follows (these are some of my favorites, but everyone will have different opinions and you should do a little research): 
Good luck!

Ether is massively overvalued and NEM/XRP are scams?  Not sure the logic behind that statement, but I would have to strongly disagree with all 3 points.
