A company choosing to use s currency of their choice and it's "industrial level fraud".
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:36:56
What's money to you?
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:40:18
This isn't well received in BTC anymore. I think this flag applies even in Bitcoin.

Is BitTorrent a mesh?
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:44:24
Exactly. LN assume Bitcoin is a mesh. That assertion is flawed. Bitcoin is a small world near complete graph. LN can't scale.

Get ready for the ban hammer.

Explain to me how what you saw wasn't a free market.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:29:34
You are just making things up. I've been in crypto long enough to know that everyone blames everything they don't like on "market manipulation".

Socialism has never actually been tried before, right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:13:33
So many "bitcoiners" are more socialist than anything else these days
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:57:02
STOP CRYING TO THE GOVERNMENT. IF BTC IS GOING TO SUCCEED IT MUST COMPETE. 
Christ this sub is full of communists now.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:59:18
Yep - it's this simple! No complexities here at all!
C'mon everyone - Bitcoin is socialist now don't you know? Taxation is moral.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:40:05
Yes. That's a free market. Grow up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:18:41
I like you. People like you have been banned from this subreddit for a long time.

Bitfinex has been printing Tethers out of thin air to pump BTC. They got caught and Tether is now pretending like they were "hacked".
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:19:50
This is absolutely retarded. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:13:14
Bitfinex has yet to prove they're solvent. So my statement is just as valid as their claim that they're solvent. 
This is Mt Gox all over again. Is everyone here too new to remember that?
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:20:21
Asking for government intervention... Wtf happened to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:22:04
Try it with two words.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:46:05
Why is everyone here obsessed with character assassinations? Is it because you can't argue the ideas?
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:48:34
Why has bcash been kicking our ass the past two weeks?
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:00:12
Do you guys ever wonder why this sub is just full of price speculation while every other crypto sub has actual discussion on tech? Why is that?

If you needed any validation that the TA you read on here is bullshit, read this thread.

"the biggest threat to Bitcoin right now is the largest company that actually enables Bitcoin to be used for payments."
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:47:46
You sound like a fascist.
Fuck Erik for growing the use of Bitcoin! Yeah!
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:02:25
Congrats guys! We've barely improved the protocol since the ATH mempool and now the price is going up! This makes sense!
