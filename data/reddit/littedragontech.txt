The idea is like this. Bitcoin mining is particularly threatened by hardware patents because hardware patents can be used to enforce centralization, and are usually immune to protocol changes - meaning they cant be blocked by protocol changes like POW. For example, a patent on efficient ways of powering the hashboard are agnostic to the proof of work - changing POW wouldnt block the patent. Patents can literally kill decentralization.
AsicBoost is an optimization that takes advantage of a quirk of SHA256 POW calculation that allows it to be calculated in a more energy efficient way. This means regardless of whatever advances and efficiencies a mining manufacture comes up with (e.g. smaller nm size or other engineering efficiencies), you can always get more by using AsicBoost.
There are two forms of AsicBoost - one is visible and the other is invisible. The invisible form has some unfortunate consequences that have lead it to get a bad reputation (because it's easier to do with empty or low tx volume blocks which is antisocial). Overt version-rolling however does not have these problems and has the advantage of being visible on the blockchain.
If AsicBoost is licensed under a defensive license then it can discourage patent aggression by the incentives of the license. Blockchain DPL requires that you join the BDPL community agreeing to license your patents (if any) to other BDPL Users and commit to non-aggression to other BDPL Users. This creates a defensive community and pool of highly desirable patents.
