I built a small bitcoin dispenser using this printer and the guide on [this website]( a couple years ago, with the paper that came with the unit. What I printed is still legible now (even in Houston humidity), but as others have said, it's probably not a good long term solution.

BIP65 activation just means the protocol supports it. I'm not aware of a wallet that implements BIP65 yet. That will probably be the best thing when it's been developed. Since it was only this year it will probably be a few weeks or months.

What I'm saying is that it's clear his long term business plans are now much more complicated and expanding his business would require much more capital (initial investment or loans).
Capital is one of the greatest controlling factors in starting a new business.

Is there a different definition of *lobbying* down under? I'm sure they will soon if they haven't already, but in this article they are responding to an inquiry, not hiring people to wine and dine politicians. They asked for mastercard's opinion, and mastercard gave it. There's nothing morally wrong with having an opposing viewpoint in a free society.

this is an excellent post which should be read by anyone who has already used bitcoin and built up habits and assumptions but hasn't used a deterministic wallet yet.

This would mitigate the problem, but would still only be indefinitely sustainable when demand for bitcoins and cash is equal. The same problems arise 99% of the time: either more people are depositing or more people are withdrawing. The machine will eventually run out of cash or be full of cash, and the requirement for logistics of handling cash will always be there.
If the machine changed its rates to maintain a fixed supply of cash, it would cut into profits.

Cash is expensive (this is not a hard argument to convey in this subreddit). If you forgo the banks, you have to pay to transport, store, secure, and process large volumes of dirty pieces of paper. The banks already have infrastructure to support businesses to overcome these problems.
It's also likely he would run into a problem where many more people bought bitcoin than sold it. Liquidity is an easy problem to solve when all the cash is deposited in a bank account or drawn out again, but with no bank, you would need to keep a vault with enough cash on hand to meet every ATM's demands. This additional capital requirement can be significant.
Third, without banks he has few (read:expensive) options for getting loans to expand his business quickly.
These aren't immediate problems for someone with a handful of machines. But as the owner stated on his website, this presents challenges to his **long-term** business plans. It makes the scope of his business much more complicated. I don't blame him.

I'm from the US.
When you add an account, there are two options. Bank account and credit card. I have a visa debit card which can be charged like a credit card and I tried that for $20. The fee was 58 cents (2.9%, the usual credit card fee).
If you pick the bank account option, you supply an account number and routing number similar to an echeck form (this would not be the same as a debit card number).

going by the numbers in the article, the most they can expect if they find no new coins anywhere and all all claims are equally valid is 202,185/850,000 = 23.8%.

Low, but not zero. It's like junk bonds, there's always a price low enough to be worth the risk and the time.

You can use it anywhere, though it is up to a business owner to accept it. Unlike accepting credit cards, the owner just downloads an app and he's ready to take it.

Your implication is that bitcoin is anti-correlated with the USD against other currencies. This chart goes up, and the bitcoin/usd chart goes down, but the scales are completely different. I'm not familiar with the index you provided, but here is a comparison of bitcoin to UUP, which I believe is similar.

Premise of the article is on the third page, following a fairly exhaustive explanation of what paycoin is and the problems perceived with it.
The author speculates that Hashlets may be a marketing tool of a company which is far better capitalized than people think. He then explains how Paycoin could ultimately out-compete bitcoin because it has enough of bitcoin's improvements over our current monetary system, but also has the centralization to attract capitalization from banks. He also feels that such a plan does not require widespread community support, hence the opaque practices.
He's already spent 2 pages explaining why it's much more likely that Paycoin is a scam. There are more reasons beside opacity, like the broken promises, that scream scam. So it's unlikely any of this is a problem with Paycoin anyway. But could his concerns be applicable to another altcoin in the future? Could someone start another centralized altcoin that wasn't so opaque and scammy, and manage to attract capitalization before bitcoin succeeds?
I think it would depend on how much capitalization it would take for that kind of plan to be successful, how imminent bankers perceive bitcoin to be, how threatened bankers feel, and how quickly their altcoin is adopted by the larger public. It's not a completely irrational fear. Nearly every time society has changed its monetary system, it was lead by a well-capitalized, central authority. This is a rare time for a community to lead such a change.

Many people thought that Assange was dead or had lost control of his online identity. Statements which appeared to come from him were allegedly pre-recorded and/or scheduled to be published automatically.
Using the blockchain like this is like holding up a newspaper with today's date in the camera to prove the video is live. (Except better, because a video of a newspaper might be photoshopped somehow)

In gerrymandering, you draw lines on a map that are politically convenient for your party. In technical analysis of investments, you choose a timeframe that is convenient for your argument.

Good point. OP's method of framing is not as arbitrary as the worst examples of gerrymandering, but I think intended to make a more general point about most of the charts on this sub.
