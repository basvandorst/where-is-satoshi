Be more careful, good asking questions.
Is it exu coin, who knows.
Why would you use an exchange you know nothing about?
@_date: 2019-12-06 17:52:35
I would just ignore, personally.

He's not your friend, buddy.

Yes, you mean move them from CB, right?
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:34:16
Trezor or a Nano Ledger.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:14:32

Bitcoin ATM, as opposed to Coinbase?
I thought when I bought from Coinbase those coins were mine and stashed away in cold storage. Am I wrong?
