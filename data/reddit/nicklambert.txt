Hey Kyle. Thanks, I saw your questions on the mailing list. I think the value increase will come through increasing demand for a finite resource. As safecoin is used for products and services both on and off the network and can be thought of as digital cash (anonymous and immediate transactions) as opposed to bitcoin with it's public and accountable ledger.

The first apps will be coming out in the next few weeks todu, so I would recommend signing up to our dev list and checking out website and Twitter account for updates. Things are moving pretty quickly now :)

Thanks, welcome to the SAFE network!

Employee alert: The speed of the sale exceeded our expectations by a long way. The guys participating in MSC had an advantage because the master potocol was able to issue MaidSafeCoins much faster than those using btc, as there was a couple of manual steps involved to convert btc to MaidSafeCoins. This was enabling msc holders to get in much faster and we wanted to ensure that both communities could participate on as level a playing field as possible. We will end up with a 50/50 split.

Hi todu, disclaimer: MaidSafe employee. Not buzzwords, there are significant differences between MaidSafe and Freenet (which is a great project btw). Freenet is really an anonymous publishing platform, it was never intended for users to store private data or share data with a select group, only to publish to everyone. So a petty big difference for starters. 
As I understand it, Freenet inherently removes data that isn't accessed, on the MaidSafe network, the user has total control of data and it is only deleted when they decide to remove it.  So in this respect Freenet doesn't really permit 'ownership of data'.

Hi, employee alert: safecoins have their own type of block chain type technology, we would call it a transaction mechanism. Not sure if I see this as competing with the block chain, as I will explain bitcoin offers an auditable transaction ledger where our system shows only the current and existing owners of the coin. In this way safecoins could be thought of as digital cash. This way of working does offer some advantages, allowing many millions of transactions per second and transaction confirmation in seconds.
Not sure if a way of measuring proof of resource is possible using the bitcoin protocol. I'm sure their devs would be able to confirm this. However, in order to get this working on the SAFE network, MaidSafe developed a new and highly efficient DHT based on Kademlia, which enables extremely fast and accurate information about the state of the network to be known. Hope this info helps!

Disclosure: MaidSafe employee. Each file is encrypted and split into chunks during our encryption process (Self Encryption). The network keeps and maintains 4 copies of each encrypted chunk and moves these fragments around the network as nodes become unavailable, either through failure or power down. In order to cope with this churn the network is able to reconfigure globally extremely quickly (20 milli seconds). The chunks are also spread globally for increased robustness. The MaidSafe network is completely autonomous and all these operations are handled by the system and completely without our knowledge. Hope this info helps!

MaidSafe employee: This transaction was taken to purchase MaidSafeCoins to make them available for btc users as they were disadvantaged during the sale (transactions delayed due to a compulsory manual process) that was enabling MSC users to get in more quickly. We wanted to even up participation for both groups and have ended up with a 50/50 split.

Thanks srintuar, could you explain the nonsense authentication logic to me?
@_date: 2014-04-22 20:43:53
The transaction looks okay and is valid so you should be okay. Have you used a mastercoin wallet to try and view your MaidSafeCoins? The issuance process for anyone participating in MSC is automated so you should get your MaidSafeCoins pretty much straight away. Email us at info if you have any trouble.&gt;

Hi, to maintain transparency our code is entirely Open Source and we are also open development, our code is available here:  Our technology is vast and conceived over a number of years, some of our patents:  If you have any specific concerns please let us know or check us out on reddit, there has been quite a lot of debate and you may find some of it useful.

Hi AgentME, MaidSafe employee here. Yes the video is high level and was never really intended to get into too much detail, just to promote a concept which we know to be new. We are quite different from the other projects you mention (e.g Freenet is an anonymous publishing platform, similarly GNUnet does not permit 'ownership' of data..etc..). There is no other FULLY decentralized system where you can login to your own data! I think we will probably write a blog post explaining these differences in more detail, but in a nutshell we are the only platform that has the decentralization of the Internet at the core of our design, on an autonomous and competely serverless network.
We are still working on our 'proof of resource' paper and how it links to a coin based incentive, so it is fair to say that details are a bit thin on the ground just now. We will have something more concrete in place very soon. Please check back in a couple of weeks, we will refine this document with the help of the community  and your feedback would be much appreciated.
@_date: 2014-04-22 21:27:36
It would appear that people are looking to buy but no one willing to sell:
@_date: 2014-02-23 22:34:09
I will have a look at the FAQ and think about how we can improve it. Thanks for the tip btw, much appreciated!
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:12:16
Hi, MaidSafe employee. We recognise that our documentation is a little fragmented and we are working on pulling together a white paper that will help bring things together better. This shouldn't take more than a few weeks, in the meantime thanks for your patience.
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:21:06
The guys are working on the issuance of the coins right now to bitcoin users, all msc guys should have their's already. The bonus comes from the 430 million coins. Hope this info helps.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:07:06
Employee alert: We are working through how the tokens will be distributed at the moment and we will be publishing this as part of a white paper to the community soon, we'll make this an open and transparent process. Hopefully this won't be a mystery for too much longer.
@_date: 2014-04-19 07:10:40
You will receive MaidSafeCoins but you won't be able to see them. In order to see MaidSafeCoins (and potentially send them or sell them),  you need to download a mastercoin wallet:

Yes we have run a number of simulations to determine how many replicants we should keep. These were carried out in conjunction with leading Universities. Thanks for the interest!
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:06:36
Yes we removed the self encryption paper to amend it but hadn't put it back yet, my apologies. In the meantime here is a link to the patent application that explains self encryption: 
In reading this document you will notice that "Hash of initial chunk (pre encryption) is used to encrypt the corresponding xored chunk + 1...." is not actually obfuscation, it is using parts of the data to encrypt itself. 
I suspect that this short message will do little to appease your concerns, we have all been fed so much crap of the years that I can hardly blame you. Once the network is launched and peer reviewed by independent and respected experts will change your mind.

Hi Joepie, it is a fact that we cannot take our already released GPL code away from the Open Source community and we have no intentions of doing so. It does not guarantee that it would be forked but highly likely. We are Open Source, open development and are looking at implementing a token based system for developers to start building products on the network, rather than charging 30% of revenue used by others. We are also more really interested to here what others think and I thank you for your candour, how would you recommend we license our business?  
@_date: 2014-02-24 15:55:13
Hi Joepie, disclosure part, I'm a MaidSafe employee. Your concerns were discussed at length in another string: 
The upshot is that all contributions given to MaidSafe are done under both GPLv3 and MaidSafe's license (dual). If something is GPL (and you can see that all our code is and available in Github) it cannot be taken off the community, it remains GPL forever. If we suddenly went mad and started to try and change our license it is likely the community would hard fork our code. We are also open development as well as open source, so we are being as transparent as we possibly can. By using GPL, we have given up all exclusive rights to the code.
@_date: 2014-04-19 09:57:53
Yes you can receive them on any bitcoin wallet. You could just use a web wallet to see them or Mastercoin block explorers (such as masterchest.info) to view your MaidSafeCoin balance.

Hi, employee here. Yes we don't always get everything right on the PR front, we try to be as up front and as open and honest as possible and we are still learning. No part of our code is closed, not only is the SAFE network Open Source, we are also completely open development so everything is out in the open.   If there is anything you need to know about MaidSafe or what we are doing please let us know.
