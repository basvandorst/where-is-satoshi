You don't. HODL! Sell when you absolutely need the money. If you don't need it, don't sell it.

Is it safe to keep my coins in coinbase? Is it "safer" to keep them elsewhere? If so, where would be the "safest" place to keep my BTC?

If you are constantly sending coins to the same address this raises a red flag to coinbase and circle. They then investigate to where those coins are being sent. It's not hard for them to find out that theses addresses belong to members of (whatever gambling website used). Coinbase has your personal info, if you live in place where gambling is illegal, this is how you get caught. To avoid this, some gambling websites allow for you to "refresh" (change) your wallet address. Solution: Refresh your gambling website address every time you send money from your circle or coinbase. Doing this throws coinbase/circle off and raises no flags.  // Nitrogensport is a website that I know of that allows for users to change addresses up to 5 times in one day.
