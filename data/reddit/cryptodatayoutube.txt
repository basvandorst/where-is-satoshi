I just wanted to give a different take on the subject since other's views are different
@_date: 2018-10-24 03:26:47
It'll be interesting to see how it turns out. Technically it's in beta since no other phone manufacturer has done this so I'm sure there will be some hiccups. Nonetheless, it gets people talking about cryptos.

Same here! It definitely takes some practice. The 2h seems to work the best as well as the 15m and 30m. Don't be afraid to switch bias at a moment's notice. Anything can happen in this market so it's best to have backup indicators and not have a bias one way or the other

Over the years I've learned the best indicators to use on Tradingview based on my style of trading for Bitcoin. I like to use multiple indicators for confirmation trades and determine how much capital I want to use. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!

This was one of the main reasons for the Bitcoin decline. See why it's affecting the crypto market and why miners are so divided. If you have any questions, let me know! I'll be happy to assist.
@_date: 2019-01-19 19:21:12

I just watched a lot of YouTube videos and followed people that had good track records. Over time I developed my own strategy for what worked best. In all essence, it's best not to overcomplicate it and just master a few good indicators

@_date: 2018-12-04 00:49:57
Lol exactly. Maybe they're getting cold feet and think Bitcoin will drop lower and want to grab more afterwards. It's hard to say with that much 
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:29:25
Great minds think alike :) 
Amazon is such a big driving force that they're literally creating their own market. I believe it's only a matter of time before they start accepting Bitcoin. They're one of the companies that want to be on the forefront of technology, not behind

Over the Counter purchases. Basically they're purchases made directly with third parties, not between exchanges. Think of OTC like an auction for Bitcoin or you selling your friend Bitcoin (so you technically don't see that volume reflected on the current price)
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:09:13
In this video, I cover a wallet address that just moved over 66,000 Bitcoin to an unknown address. Could this be indicative of a big sell-off or just more FUD? I couldn't find many articles about this, I'm assuming Coindesk or Cointelegraph will write about it soon. I also cover some bitcoin analysis at the end of the video.

@_date: 2018-12-04 00:31:01
Really? That's not good if so. I can see them trying to cash out, thus sending the price way lower. I was hoping they would try OTC selling to help mitigate that. It's a good shorting opportunity if it happens 
@_date: 2018-12-12 03:08:04
You're very right. That would probably up the profitability to 10 miners or more. Thanks for the insight ��
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:51:03
Lol I'm sure he is! He's so humble that it's hard not to like him. I'm sure he'll continue to grow throughout next year ��

I can only imagine! Apparently the cost was only $3.80 which is insane

Lol right! That's some money 
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:52:06
Thanks! I'll check it out ��
@_date: 2018-12-11 06:18:21
Very true, but these were more than just pure guesses. Check some of his other videos, he's very knowledgeable on the crypto space in general and TA
@_date: 2019-05-04 20:06:25
That checks ��
@_date: 2018-12-03 02:48:55
Exactly. His reputation is diminishing fast and I don't see him gaining it back anytime soon. It's unfortunate since he is a big proponent of the space but you can't deny the facts. It's going to take a little bit longer before we see Bitcoin at all time highs again (I'm thinking end of next year)
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:32:36
Love it ��
@_date: 2018-12-04 04:13:16
Lol wouldn't it be nice to get some of that Bitcoin. I'm interested to see what happens in the next couple of days
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:50:43
Glad you cleared that up ��

Davincij15 just had an interview with MMCrypto where he makes another prediction about when he thinks the Bitcoin ETF will get approved. For those who don't know, Davincij15 blew up on Reddit a week ago whenever an old video of him predicting the rise of Bitcoin in 2011 surfaced. He also predicted the 2008 financial crisis and the sell-off at $20,000. If you enjoyed the video, please like, comment, and subscribe :D
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:49:17
There was, but now the difficulty has increased exponentially and people are no longer awarded the same amount of BTC when they mine a block. Therefore the computing power needed and electricity cost is what makes it so hard to stay profitable nowadays
