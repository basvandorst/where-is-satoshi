The more transactions with bitcoin, the more it is converted into fiat and other forms of products, and therefore the less the value of each bitcoin, unless, of course, new buyers come in to keep the price elevated. 
So, it is not the sales themselves that matter, it is the publicity that comes along with it.

Apparently something scary is going on. Untill that is fized, I suggest everyone be careful moving bitcoins around. If your bitcoins are in an exchange, sell at least part of them.

The indicator? For example, stochastics is at below 20 which is very low. If you know what you are talking about you should be able to find that out yourself.

To pay the lost coins!

if receiving jpy is easy, why are not people selling for yen, withdraw and change to USD in a regular banking system? In fact, why isn't mt Gox doing it?

Oddly enough, bitcoin exchanges are ruled by law in China. The owners of exchanges dare not take the money and run. One exchange attempted to do that and the exchange operators ended up in jail. The same cannot be said for exchanges in other countries.

The very definition if bitcoin is that it is not planned or launched by a central system, such as the ones from google or apple.

Can you covert bitcoin to cash with an ATM ?

I have a bold prediction: bitcoin at Gox will drop much further from here so that the exchange can buy back enough coins to pay the missing coins. The ultimate price bottom? I don't know.

Do we really care about what's going on in China with bitcoin? The world has moved on with bitcoin and will leave China berried in haze and dust. This is sad, but the economic control in China is terrible, and do you really think that China will take the lead in bitcoin development?
