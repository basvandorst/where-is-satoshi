They must be *made* to care, otherwise many will behave in a way that saves them money by incurring higher cost for the network as a whole - the so-called tragedy of the commons problem.
A way to make them care is to offer them lower transaction fees for behaving in a way that is healthier for the network. Incentives are at an optimum when behaving selfishly is the same as behaving altruistically, and this brings us closer to that.

@_date: 2016-04-05 14:26:43
The "network" in Lightning Network means transaction can be routed between many participants, so that you don't need a channel with every single merchant.
For example, if A has a channel with B, and B has a channel with C, then A can pay C through his existing channel with B. These chains can in theory be arbitrarily long, but thanks to the "small world" phenomenon, they will rarely need to be longer than 6-7. If you open one or more additional channels, this number shrinks.
Note that routing is a really hard nut to crack and I wouldn't be surprised if it's not fully functional in the first releases of Lightning.

Bitcoin is always being promoted a bit disingenuously. We used to say that "Bitcoin is good because transactions are free and instant!" But of course that's not true. Back then they were free, sure, and people were less familiar with the outrageous dangers of accepting zero-conf transactions, so transactions were "instant".
These days we promote Bitcoin as being super duper transparent because the blockchain is an open ledger. And that's mostly true today; in fact you need to take extraordinary steps to avoid the transparency. But like "free and instant", this is not the future of Bitcoin. Schnorr signatures will boost the anonymity of CoinJoin as well as actually make CoinJoin cheaper than not using CoinJoin, so anonymity might very well become the rule rather than the exception. Lightning Network transactions certainly aren't on an open and transparent ledger. Confidential Transactions could very well be coming to Bitcoin. In fact there is a ton of research happening in order to take away the "transparency", because without transparency, you have fungibility, which a currency absolutely has to have. I dare say that there is no future where Bitcoin remains an "open, transparent ledger".

Gemini doesn't even compress their public keys, so their transactions are bigger, for *no* reason at all. Compression is free, compatible with everything, quick to implement.

This is not true. Non-RBF zeroconf works the same as it always did. If a transaction is RBF, it is explicitly marked as such, making it glaringly easy to see. If you think zeroconf is a good idea, you can decide to not accept RBF transactions.
See [the FAQ](
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:09:04
Yes, otherwise there would be no need for a blockchain. This is the same for all cryptocurrencies.
You will also be exposed to FUD saying that it's worse in Bitcoin's case because Bitcoin users can opt-in to an additional feature called [Replace By Fee]( (RBF), which lets you change transactions while pending by increasing its fee. However, this cannot be used fraudulently since such transactions are explicitly marked as replaceable. Merchants can ignore such transactions.

You think Todd is purposefully sabotaging Bitcoin in order to help banks? Wow. What is his motivation for that, do you think?


That makes absolutely no sense. All LN transactions are irreversible. As a sender, you can choose to include a refund address that the receiver can choose to use if he chooses to give you your money back. You can do exactly the same with normal on-chain Bitcoin transactions by using the Payment Protocol. What's wrong with that, in your view?

Overall a great gesture that should be welcomed and not questioned. But I think it is worth philosophizing over the fact that there is now a non-negligible chance that when you start your full node, every single node it connects to is controlled by BTCC.
Tor has a way to allow operators of multiple Tor nodes to declare that they all belong to the same operator. That way, Tor clients can avoid routing through multiple nodes from the same operator, at least when that operator is honest and good-intentioned. Thanks to the wonders of proof-of-work sybil-attacks aren't that great of a problem with Bitcoin nodes, but maybe there should be a similar mechanism here? BTCC kind of does it by changing the user agent, but that's not really what it's for.

~~No, a segwit transaction has exactly one transaction ID.~~
The transaction ID is just a hash of the transaction, so it's not even stored in the transaction, and therefore it takes up zero space.
Edit: for backwards-compatibility reasons, there is indeed two transaction IDs. None of them are stored on the blockchain, so they take up no storage space.

SatoshiDICE wasn't spam, it was just inefficient use of the blockchain. When block space is ample and free, that is what happens: it's cheaper to just thoughtlessly dump data on it than to actually reason about how it could be done more efficiently.
People say that unless we urgently increase the block size limit, some use cases will be priced out of the blockchain. This is true, but it has in fact been a constantly ongoing process for most of Bitcoin's history. It happened to SatoshiDICE, and then it happened to those services who wanted to offer on-chain file storage, and it will keep happening. But the remarkable thing is that Bitcoin's utility value keeps going up. We are forced to learn more efficient, innovative use of the blockchain. This is a fundamentally good thing.
@_date: 2016-01-03 16:17:34
Yeah, that one stood out to me as strange. Yes, SW increases capacity without reducing the amount that validating nodes have to download. Naively increasing the block size limit is no different, so what's his point? With SW we get a capacity increase *in addition* to lots of other extremely useful improvements. (Of course you can argue that SW's capacity increase is not enough, but that's not his focus here)

When you use RBF to update a transaction, it *replaces* the old transaction in mempools. You can't "spam" using RBF because you need to increase the fee by a certain amount for each time you replace. Also, mempools aren't full.

@_date: 2016-01-17 15:19:40
Mainly because I acknowledge that block space is naturally scarce (regardless of block size limit). In economics, a good way to distribute a scarce resource is through an economic competition we call a market. Bitcoin has fees for this, but with the way things are today, users have to just make their best guesses for what to set this fee to. Fee estimation algorithms can only look at the past, not the future, so these are inherently non-optimal. So this marketplace is dysfunctional. RBF helps fix this.
In addition, updating unconfirmed transactions is a useful function in some cases, and out of the alternatives for doing so, full RBF is the most efficient (in terms of transaction size). As such, RBF helps Bitcoin scale.
When it's opt-in, full RBF is completely harmless. If you think zero-conf is secure enough in a given case, you are free not to use RBF or not to accept such transactions.

Let's agree that with a 1MB block size limit, on-chain Bitcoin transactions can not satisfy everybody's use cases. Yes, you could say that's an argument for increasing it, but 1MB is what we currently have and we live today.
Given that, some types of transactions can no longer be on-chain. We use transaction fees to find out which ones. Without RBF you just have to make your best guess. With RBF, you can have a functional, free market for block space. Some people will try to transact, increase the fee a few times, and eventually acknowledge that they are being priced out. Now they have to wait for their transaction to drop out of mempools (they can also use the new abandontransaction RPC call in Bitcoin Core 0.12).
That situation pretty much sucks for them, but it communicates to them clearly that their use case is priced out. They might not attempt such an on-chain transaction again. The free market has done its job, thanks to RBF. Bitcoin has lost some utility value for some people, but is still valuable for others (noticeably higher-value transactions).
Remember the days when SatoshiDICE transactions were by far the most common? We don't do that anymore. It got priced out. Bitcoin lives on and has thrived since then. Pricing-out is an ongoing process, and the sky is not falling.
Eventually, utility value for lower-value transactions will return, but in other forms, probably similar to Lightning Network. Bitcoin has a bright future.

And this is why transactions that are clearly and unambiguously marked as having opted into RBF should not be trusted at zero confirmations. Transactions that are not marked as such, still have the same security properties as today.


But it's *not* altering any "contract". When a transaction is marked as RBF, the contract is that it can be replaced until it is confirmed. That's what the RBF flag means. Replacing it operates within this contract.
(Although I object to the term "contract" in this case. In a cryptocurrency, unconfirmed transactions follow no protocol rules - each node decides its policy. There can be no contract without consensus, and the blockchain is how we reach consensus.)

No, they can make an unlimited amount of transactions per day. The assumption is that they close/reopen channels twice *per year*.
The "only two transactions per day" scenario is for regular on-chain transactions, and in that scenario they think we would need 24 *gigabyte* blocks. This is to illustrate the enormous scale LN can bring.

That's not going to happen unless Classic implements CSV, and there's no indication that they will.

It's not "too late" - Bitcoin is still fully functional. Even if fees *explode* up to 50 cents, it's not going to be prohibitive. It's not clear if people are going to switch to different, less secure cryptocoins just to save a few pennies.
But when you talk about darkmarkets, it's not about saving money, it's about staying out of prison. Privacy and anonymity are of utmost importance. Darkmarket users don't use Bitcoin because Paypal charges such outrageous fees, after all. Bitcoin's competition isn't lower-fee altcoins, it's higher-anonymity altcoins. And those exist.
But privacy and anonymity are being worked on with high priority for Bitcoin as well. Segwit isn't just a dumb capacity increase - it will allow improvements like Schnorr signatures, which could actually make CoinJoin transactions cheaper than regular transactions, so everyone would mix their coins on every transaction, even for buying coffee. That would be a huge boon for darkmarket users (a much larger crowd to hide in). Combine that with other tech being worked on, especially Confidential Transactions, and Bitcoin will blow the competition away.
And then comes the Lightning Network. Here we can transact without our transactions even hitting the blockchain. Nobody except the person paying and the person being paid even needs to know the transaction ever took place. This has the potential of being an enormous privacy boost.

Well [the soft fork has now been withdrawn]( due to this issue, so clearly the Ethereum developers think this is a serious issue. They currently do not know how to fix it, so you might want to get in touch with them if you can help.

Yes, so Compact Blocks is not so much about fast block propagation as it is about fixing these sudden bursts in network bandwidth use. Fast block propagation is important only for miners, and they already use the Fast Relay Network (FRN), which is still faster than Compact Blocks (CB). But while FRN is a centrally controlled private network, CB is decentralised and suited for universal adoption.

Welcome, [Monero user](
Cash has many important properties. It is debatable whether fungibility is the *most* important one. Bitcoin certainly has challenges here, but these are being actively worked on. Confidential transactions and economically incentivised CoinJoin through Schnorr signatures are only two examples.
I like Monero, but it has its own issues. Scalability is one of them - transactions are huge and the blockchain is not prunable. Monero could become irrelevant the second Bitcoin improves its fungibility, and that is what I personally think will happen. Until then, I'm glad Monero exists for those that need what it offers.

What are the "real issues" that you see?
I agree that decentralisation is not the goal, but a means towards the goal. I would say the goal is censorship resistance, by which I mean my ability to transfer funds to anybody else without the ability of any party to prevent me from doing it. I don't know of any other ways to achieve this than through decentralisation, although there are other means that might help, such as Confidential Transactions - which Maxwell also works on.

I got into Bitcoin in 2011. I got obsessed with it and read as much as I could. Somewhere I read someone saying that Bitcoin is inherently unsuitable for micropayments. I was disappointed to hear that, and it took me a while to understand exactly why that was the case.
This is five years ago now. Bitcoin hasn't changed - it was never what you thought it was. It's really too bad that it was mismarketed to such a degree. If you want a cheap alternative to Visa, Bitcoin can probably be that for you some time, but it's not that now and that was never the point. The point is censorship-resistance and political independence. Everything outside of that is gravy.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:24:50

[Routing is close to being solved.](


Agree, but if people do that, I haven't seen it. LN is useful for many things, but far from all. For the things it *is* useful for, it's is *tremendously useful*. I expect it will be useful enough that it will free up a lot of on-chain capacity for the things it's *not* useful for.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:40:54
Well I gave one use case that I could think about, but there are probably many others. Censorship-resistance is one, because now you no longer need the internet to verify transactions, and these satellites carry lots of other comms as well which makes it tougher for regimes to jam, or even shoot down.
But as with many other foundational technologies, they start out as hobbyist toys. And while they are most useful for people in under-developed countries or in oppressive regimes, it's the first-world rich kids who start playing with them first. We'll have to wait and see what people come up with. At least we can definitely say that the Bitcoin network is meaningfully more resilient today because of this.
@_date: 2016-11-16 21:26:04
Well it is! In their new and strange redefinition of "vaporware": a piece of software which hasn't yet seen pervasive adoption. So even after LN is done and people are starting to use it, they will kepe insisting it is vaporware.
This fallacy is called [moving the goalposts]( They've had it running for a long time, and it has progressed like this:
* LN is just a hypothesis, it doesn't actually *exist*.
* LN is just a few papers, it doesn't exist.
* LN is just a git repo, it doesn't exist.
* LN is just five git repos from different companies, it's just vaporware.
* LN doesn't have routing implemented and it never will, it's just vaporware.
* LN can only be used in testnet, it's just vaporware. *&lt;-- WE ARE HERE*
* LN can't actually be used anywhere, there's no adoption, so it's just vaporware.

Giving Peter credit for RBF is very unfair. It was Satoshi's idea and he implemented it first. It had to be disabled because it was vulnerable to DOS attacks, and Peter came up with a way to fix that.
RBF doesn't make it "largely impossible for people to trust zero-conf transactions". RBF transactions are clearly marked as such. If a transaction is not RBF, you can trust it the same as you've been able to trust 0-conf ever. (Which is hopefully not much)

Arguable. You can't download liquid-sourcecode.tar.gz, and set up your own Liquid node. But nobody would want that, because Liquid is just something that Blockstream provides for exchange operators.

Thanks, happy to be wrong about this. I heard a podcast interview with one of their developers a while back, and was left with the impression that Bisq was some sort of business model for a startup of theirs. Glad to hear this was a wrong impression.
They did announce plans for the "BSQ token", which is like an ICO that they insist is not an ICO, but nonetheless one of its functions is to raise money to pay for development.
Furthermore, if you pay trading fees using BSQ tokens instead of bitcoins, you get a 90% discount. This is strange since you say that trading fees are optional and you can just give yourself a 100% discount without these BSQ tokens.

There's not much need to dig. If you want to follow development, you can read the weekly meeting notes.
Also, note that Bitcoin Core is not an organisation and doesn't have a top-down opinion that "members" follow. It doesn't have official stances at all, as far as I'm aware, so when you struggle to find that, it's because there are none. Core is a large and loosely organised open source project working on rough consensus through meritocracy.

Here's someone explaining more:


So you might get a big block that takes 30 minutes to validate. If another block is received while the first block is still validating, and that other block finishes validation faster, it wins.
But if the second block never comes, the first block wins. All clients must now forever deal with a block that takes 30 minutes to validate.

It's conceptually sensible, but there are good arguments for both, and indeed I hope we will get both modes. In [the pull request]( Todd says FSS-RBF can easily be added  if there's demand from wallet vendors. So far, apparently wallet vendors think FSS would be burdensome to implement.
So what does full-RBF have over FSS? Replacement transactions are smaller. FSS transactions need to contain all the same outputs, so you can only *add* outputs, not remove. So in order to bump the fee, you need to add a new input. This makes the transaction bigger. Miners, as I understand it, prefer smaller transactions because it allows them to include more transactions per block, which gives them more fees.
Also full-RBF allows you to do things FSS cannot, such as "undoing" an unconfirmed transaction by double-spending it back to yourself.
@_date: 2015-11-29 10:44:45

The only holy timestamping rule in Bitcoin is the timestamps on blocks. Transaction relay policy is a *policy*, which means it's up to each node to decide what to do. Policy by definition *cannot* be enforced.

I feel like is getting flooded with posts that are only tangentially related to Bitcoin lately. But this post is not even that.
@_date: 2015-11-29 10:36:09
First let's define consensus in Bitcoin. Consensus means the whole network agreeing on the order of transactions - so for example given two transactions, when there is consensus, the network agrees which of the two transactions happened first.
RBF is not consensus-critical because it is not possible to reach consensus on the ordering of unconfirmed transactions. If it were, we wouldn't need a blockchain at all.
The block size limit rule is consensus-critical because it's a rule that decides which blocks are valid and which aren't. If you include a transaction in a block which I think is invalid, I will continue to consider that transaction as unconfirmed, but you consider it confirmed. You think we have consensus, and I think we don't.
@_date: 2015-11-22 08:36:04

@_date: 2015-11-29 15:34:08
The receiver can sort of force it by not giving the sender what he paid for if the sender defied his request to not use RBF. If the receiver can inform the sender of this quickly, the sender has a chance to undo the transaction and send a new non-RBF transaction.
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:06:19
What's your point? I don't understand the question you pose in the title.
@_date: 2015-11-27 18:16:46
This is not a softfork, because it's not about consensus. It's just a policy which nodes can choose to follow or not, regarding which transactions they relay and admit into their mempools.

@_date: 2016-10-20 08:22:07
Segwit also enables the development of Schnorr signatures, signature aggregation and MAST, all of which would mean significantly smaller transactions so that more transactions fit into the same blockspace.
And for those that also care about privacy (and everyone should), all those improvements *also* improve privacy and fungibility of Bitcoin.
And this is what is being blocked now, in an attempt to get a "dumb" block size limit increase, which won't happen anyway. It's a very bad place for Bitcoin to be in right now.

Unfortunately, bitcoin got sold on a false premise: that it provides free and instant transactions. Instead, it is a stateless, authority-less, permission-less, censorship-resistant bearer asset.

I would definitely hope so as well, but my impression is that a significant portion of the Classic fans aren't interested specifically in the 2MB hardfork - they're driven by hate against Core. To them, the point of the hardfork is primarly to "fire the developers", but if they can't achieve that, they can at least impede their ability to roll out updates. It's not about technical merit to them, it's a pure power struggle.
For those who don't have that twisted mentality, they can signal support for both Classic, CSV and SegWit, thanks to versionbits. But Classic don't seem to want to make this easy - they have not released a 0.12.1 update which contains CSV, for example. It's not clear that they are going to merge SegWit at all - their voting system shows their users overwhelmingly support an incompatble hardfork version of SegWit instead.

You have to try to sleep at night while knowing that you're blocking progress. Just upgrade.

The worrying part is that they now have enough hash power to veto CSV and SegWit, even if they never come close to actually activating their hardfork. So they can basically hold Bitcoin's progress hostage.

No, Gavin was working on Inverted Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLT). If he stopped working on that, it was not because he lost commit access, and he does not need commit access to get it accepted in Core.

32 MB wasn't a constant anywhere, it was just a side-effect of the peer-to-peer network's construction, resulting in messages over that size failing to propagate. So it was not part of the consensus rules - there was no block size limit.

All of these people can choose to reject RBF transactions. If you try to pay with RBF, you don't get your coffee. It's not like it's hard to detect the RBF status.

Unlikely. He planned everything for coordinated release at the opening of the Consensus conference. All the "witnesses" had been prepared, NDAs had been signed, interviews were in the can and just waiting for the embargo to be lifted … it would be a glaring omission to not prepare for signing because his paper wallet was in Australia.

As sipa writes, this has been the subject of *intense* testing over a long time now. This is probably the best tested PR in Bitcoin's history. Even so, the ack-level should be higher than "concept". Someone™ should try to sync a node with it at least. Maybe I'll do that later.

Well of course both sides want Bitcoin to be a decentralised digital currency, and the disagreement is over how to best do that. I'm just annoyed when people invoke "Satoshi's vision" instead of arguing from technical merit. If Satoshi were still around he wouldn't be thumping his 8-year-old paper; he would take into consideration everything we've learned after Bitcoin has been in operation for so many years. I'm not saying he would support any particular side, but he certainly wouldn't be stuck with decade-old opinions. So I tend to lose interest when someone claims to represent Satoshi, for much of the same reason I tend to lose interest when someone says they are the voice of Jesus Christ. It's a cheap trick to give one's opinions undeserved weight. Arguments should stand on their own.
Excuse my rant - this is one of my pet peeves :-)

If not every single transaction gets confirmed in the very next block, then Bitcoin no longer works? If that is really what you mean, then I have to say it borders on non sequitur and I do not agree.
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:19:21


I did not understand what these supposed security problems are. Segwit is done, it's just waiting to activate - addressing security problems seems a little late at this stage. If the author believes these security problems exist, he is welcome to exploit them on Litecoin or any of the other altcoins which are now using Segwit successfully so far.
@_date: 2016-05-30 08:38:35
Just because transactions in a blockchain are permanent, doesn't mean blockchains are a good database to use if your only need is permanence. Blockchains are slow, expensive and hard to query. IPFS bills itself as "the permanent web" and gives you permanence at a fraction of the cost of blockchains.
@_date: 2016-05-17 20:13:19
Garzik is a great guy, but I've struggled to follow is reasoning lately. He introduced the concept of an "economic event", in which full blocks is some sort of crossing of the Rubicon where Bitcoin changes forever and a great injustice is done towards the end-users. People still discuss whether this event has occurred, and if it has occurred multiple times, or whatnot, so that seemed like a completely useless concept, and Bitcoin just keeps working.
And now this "anti-bitcoin" rhetoric (which reminds me of simplistic, Bush-era "anti-American" arguments) and new strange terms like "economic resource size". Meh, sorry.

Replaceable transactions are marked very clearly as being replaceable. It's very easy to check for this mark. If the mark exists, you should not accept it without confirmations. Transactions that do not have this mark, are the same as always. This is not hard.

If so: they wanted to enrich themselves by exploiting a [security vulnerability]( in Bitcoin's proof of work. Instead, it cost them two blocks. That's 25 bitcoin in just block reward, or $70,000 at the current price. Justice.
Edit: halved the block reward

This is the most important takeaway:


If successful, Liquid will lead to a more efficient Bitcoin market, because bitcoins can be moved between exchanges instantly. And that arbitrage volume is taken off the main Bitcoin chain. I can't wait (which unfortunately I will have to, again).

Some people say The Fee Event has already occurred. Some say there are regular fee events now. Some say that there is a danger of The Fee Event if we don't do something immediately.

I don't. Price is on an upwards tear already. If anything, this BU news is grim: this software is mining almost 50% of the blocks now, and it's *this bad*. (Of course it's just updated Core nodes pretending to be BU). If they manage to hardfork to their new untested consensus rules, it may not even be the new consensus rules that kills Bitcoin - it will be these random and persistent remote crash bugs.

His hypothesis is that every human being has psychic powers, but only a few even realise it. When you post things online, you inadvertently "leak" your psychic predictions through the language you use. High claims to have software that crawls the web, collecting things people post, and then analyses it to extract the psychic predictions. Finally, High interprets the resulting data in order to predict stock market prices, earthquakes and all sorts.

He did no such thing. He called the deal Charlie Lee made with Chinese miners a suicide promise. The miners would activate Segwit in return for Charlie promising to increase block size if blocks ever start getting full. This is what Greg refers to as a suicide promise - not BIP148.

The coins have been "moved" to a trust, so Wright no longer has access to them. He can request a loan, meaning a part of the coins will be "moved" to him and have to be "moved back" later. All of this happens without a single coin moving on the blockchain.

Note that LN is not a sidechain, in that it is not a blockchain.
The goal with sidechains is precisely that you will be able to exchange bitcoins for tokens on a different blockchain, where those tokens are "pegged" to an amount of bitcoin, and then later exchange them back again. There is no reason this would be cumbersome - this could be supported by GUI wallets where you select an amount, select a sidechain, and click "Exchange".

Clif High believes all humans are psychic but only a few realise it. All others unconsciously "leak" their psychic predictions out on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and other places online through things they post. High's "web bot" crawls the internet for these psychic premonitions. That is what this post is based on.
Edit: For example, High predicts a major earthquake in continental American in 2017, based on internet chatter. Geologists, meanwhile, can barely predict earthquakes a few hours ahead of time.

That's sad, but probably not far from the truth. Most "Bitcoin news sites" just regurgitate news from reddit poorly and post them back to reddit with sensational titles, or they quickly put press releases into their own words or sell ads and present them as editorial work. BM is a shining light, and I especially enjoy van Wirdum's articles; I pay close attention to the Bitcoin space in general, but his articles always teach me something new.

They say they are going to run Garzik's btc1 fork, which as far as I understand will cause signalling on bit 1 (BIP141) as well as bit 4, by the second half of July. They will also start "voting" very soon, by putting "NYA" in their coinbases, but that's just to communicate their intent to start signalling later, and it doesn't trigger anything.

A sad story among many. I've been thinking: are seniors easy to scam because the world has changed too much and too quickly for them to understand it, or is it because their mind is slipping? Or in other words: will it happen to me, too?
I can smell a scam from a mile away. I mean, I used to *think* I could, but being in the cryptocurrency world for the last five years has shown myself that I actually can. I see others around me jump on some obviously scammy, hand-wavy thing, and I say to myself "that thing is bullshit and it's going to implode and it won't be here a year from now", and a year later I'm exactly right, again and again. Not to brag; I think most people here are like that.
But as I get older, will that sense of skepticism just fade? Will I start to buy outlandish things from strangers at the door? Will I sign over my life savings to some slippery asshole at a ponzi meeting? Will I take my walker door-to-door to sell Herbalife products? This is a sombering thought, because it's not me at all.

It's funny how original meanings get lost over time. The saying is actually "here, hare!" This goes back to the traditional old English aristocracy's hare hunts. They would ride their horses into the woods and throw nets to catch hares. Upon success, the lords would shout "Here, hare!" in order to win the competition. The audience would raise their glasses and repeat "here, hare".
This hunting tradition changed over time and became the fox hunt, and as people forgot its original meaning, they would mistakenly start writing "here here". In the internet age, a common misunderstanding is that it's actually "hear hear". As you can see, this is completely wrong.
@_date: 2016-07-16 13:10:37
I just don't see the case for "local currencies". These are intentionally handicapped means of exchange, whose main reason for existing is to be *less* useful than non-local currencies. They can be spent only inside a very limited geographical area (and even there they compete with non-local currency), they are short-lived, they have much weaker guarantees than national fiat money.
The future is the opposite of non-local currency - it's currency that isn't only global, but universal.

Amazing that 3 of their 7 reasons why Onecoin is better than Bitcoin has to do with being centralised instead of decentralised. Another of their reasons is that Onecoin has lower utility than Bitcoin (cannot only be used for legal purposes), and the last point is that Onecoin is immature.
