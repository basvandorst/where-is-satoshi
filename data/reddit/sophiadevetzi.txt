Balloons are widely used, too!

Thanks for the tip :)
But you still have to pay for Bitcoin using PayPal or your card/bank information... so you still have to do this extra step, unless you have other ways of getting bitcoins?

Hmm I asked someone to pay me with red balloons, they offered bitcoins instead, because it was hard to find and carry that many baloons!

I'm testing A-Ads on a blog, and so far most of the ads were bitcoin-related or for pirate bay... I'm surprised if so many people like bitcoins, why don't they invest in it!

Who said that I'm against Bitcoin? I like it for its anonymity. but I am just a newbie so I wonder why everyone else like this currency.

I mean in general, services like A-Ads or similar... because I noticed A-Ads for example has very limited, low quality, and some shady advertisers...

Don't ask me, I'm the newbie who started this thread :D
Maybe in printed paper wallets?
But compared to other more popular methods, bitcoins are still hard to find/store/carry/transfer...

CPM, CPC, banners, affiliate links... services like A-Ads...

What kind of red balloons? can I easily exchange them for real money?
But that's not what I'm asking here. 
*Why can't I pay you by real money? How/Where should I get bitcoin? Why so complicated! Just accept real money...*

Not silly. they are humorous. see for some examples.

I am really out of ideas for the text. I used  "Let there be Bitcoin" for the [previous design]( but some people may not like that...
@_date: 2015-10-10 20:11:14
Do you realize they are not in the same category? money, dollar, euro aren't verbs, why should bitcoin be?
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:03:58
Thanks for the explanation. I am open to suggestions. 
It seems not everyone agree with you about it not being a currency:

This old thread is also interesting: [If you had to come up with a slogan/phrase/tag line for Bitcoin what would it be?](

I think it would benefit the subreddit if mods sticky it for a day or two.

Michelangelo disagrees.
