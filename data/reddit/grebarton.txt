What chart is that you are using?
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:13:46
This is actually a really good one. Like when being able to google yourself became common use meaning when you rub water melon all over your naked self while reading Ayn Rand.

Yeah I guess it could have been as simple as that but suppose it's more likely a bubble that was burst by the factors outlined but the top commentor.

I like your comparison to more relateable things, thanks.

We will see although only a few months ago the BTC price was a fraction of what it is now. You don't think this looks like a bubble of some kind or are you a true believer? If so have you sold your house to reinvest in bitcoin?

You get it! You seem to be one of the few people getting the point that bitcoin is not impervious to a crash of some kind and the offer is £475 a month or keep going with a high risk investment, simple.

Yeah, maybe a more gradual growth and sensible interest rather than gold rushers.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:00:38
Yeah I think yours it more likely.

Except property is still one of the most solid forms of investment whereas Bitcoin is still very volatile, hence the mark up. Greater risk requires a greater price and Bitcoin is still a high risk investment. The value of a thing is still only what people will both pay and accept for it and selling a high value item such as a car or property is still a great risk when accepting alternative currencies.

To what extent do you think the correction will go?
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:08:15
Yeah, profit, but then what to use the profit for in BTC?

Let me tell you about politics...... cough, cough...
