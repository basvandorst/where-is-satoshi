Because bitcoin maximalists.

What exchange did you use to buy?

I mean the fee is the main issue with bitcoin right now, what’s the problem?
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:23:17
This is just to warn people, don’t be so butthurt you prick.

A 13EUR fee is extreme, at which rate did you buy? 9000 per bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:14:48
Same.. it’s not about thousands of dollars like OP, but it’s still about money and you expect some support from a big player like this.

Probably, the subsidy was really high all over the world in the beginning.
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:41:09
Pretty fair.

The confirmation time is because of the block size. If the block size was bigger, the transaction fee will be way less then it is now.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:03:12
The transaction came from my Blockchain.info wallet, so I really don’t know..

The biggest player wins. It’s like pay2win.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:47:39
It is currently a problem. Bitcoin becomes more and more mainstream and a lot of shops already accept Bitcoin. To wait 24 hours to even get a confirmation is not acceptable.

Coinbase is pretty shit rn.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:47:26
It’s from the the same owners as Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:49:22
Memes. Nice.

I got the private key myself and I Just imported it to Blockchain to send transactions etc. Whenever I send btc I have to enter my private key. Still unsafe?
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:25:53
They will be fine there my friend.
@_date: 2017-07-22 04:11:06
