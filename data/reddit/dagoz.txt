Nerds especially get into flame wars because the type of people who would be on those boards (and this one) are usually the ones who are usually one of, if not the, smartest person in their classroom/office/social group/etc. They are used to everyone telling them how smart they are and being able to convince people by having a wider breadth knowledge than anyone else they interact with.
Well, on the BBS, everyone is that guy. They aren't used to people not agreeing with them or not acknowledging their intelligence.
Thus, ego and pride get bruised, flame wars ensue.

Yeah, BTC is a good store of wealth, but you have to venture out into the alts to really play the game. You'll lose sometimes, but win a lot more.
I'm very bullish on NAV these days and put 50% of my holdings into it. It's already gone from $.70 to $.95 since then, hoping for a big jump to about $5.00 before the end of the year.
As always, we'll see.
Best of luck to you!

Bought back in at $3150 (FOMO got to me, but missed the true bottom) and invested in Vertcoin when it was about $1.20. It's worth $4.78 today, so I'm doing alright. :)
How about you?
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:15:09
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:49:25
I'm betting on it. I cashed out into fiat at $3300, and I was waiting for it to hit about $2700 before buying back in. Maybe I'll just settle for buying back in at $3000 next time. :)
Either way, I'm comfortable sitting on my fiat and seeing what happens over the next few days. No FOMO here, and I'm fairly confident prices will, at minimum, fall back below $3300 before this is all said and done. If not, oh well, I'll buy back in when I can.

China holds somewhere in the range of 25% to 33% of Bitcoin. Most Bitcoin miners are in China.
And I agree with you, this bounceback is just the calm before the storm. I think we're in for a wild ride. But note that the two biggest exchanges (OKCoin and Huobi) can stay open until October 31st, so this may play out over a much longer course than we're expecting.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:27:46
From my experience, many Chinese are day traders. They were expecting the price to continue downward and were hoping to scrape whatever value they could when they cashed out. When they wake up and find the value has suddenly shot up, they could be a lot who sell on the spot.
We'll see in a few hours.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:48:18
I do!
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:21:54
I cashed out into fiat at $3300 on the way down (bought in when it was around $1000, so I'm up 3.3x anyway). I don't trust this pump. I'll take my chances and see if it comes back down.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:51:46
Good. I hope China gets out and stays out of crypto forever. They've already proven they can't be trusted to let the markets operate in good faith. We don't need their cheating and manipulation polluting cryptocurrencies any longer.
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:19:43
Right now, there is no guarantee that's going to happen, although I personally think that's what *will* happen, with OkCoin and Huobi basically becoming the sole "government exchanges". 
Until then, Chinese have to assume these are the last days of Bitcoin in China.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:02:59
Kraken is only good for cashing out into fiat. For everything else, use Bittrex.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:41:33
But coinbase is massively unstable, crashing or locking up during big moments. Uphold has never had such issues.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:26:18
LOL, nope!
I've been in BTC since it was at $900, so I'm up 3.5x either way. It's  currently only $200 above where I cashed out, and I'm willing to bet it's going to drop some more before this is all said and done.
I'm guessing you're a noob who thinks what happens in an hour gives you the right to crow about being right or wrong. Get back to me in a week and we'll see then. Until then, I'm leaving my fiat alone.

Hitting the $3000 buywalls.

@_date: 2017-09-15 23:04:25
I do use OKCoin.cn. I just logged in. The deposit window looks normal, if it were stopped they would have a notice up like last time.
EDIT: [Here's what it looks like to me.](
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:08:46
And I continue to say "You're a noob." I don't know where you're seeing 4000, I'm seeing 3700. I cashed out at 3300. It will fall back below that before too long. I wasn't expecting this rally to happen when it did, but there's still too much downward pressure on the market for this to sustain, and I'll carry out my original plan of buying back in once it drops far enough.
Like I said, get back to me in a week. People who have been in this game have seen these patterns before, and it's all too predictable. You can make decent returns by HODLing, but fortune favors the bold and those who don't get too emotional with the highs and the lows of the market. You'll learn one day, kiddo.

Huobi and OKCoin.cn supposedly can remain open until "the end of October", meaning Chinese will still have two huge exchanges to trade on. And even then, the "end of October" sounded a bit open-ended, like they could change their minds.
So in other words, China is just fucking with us at this point.

I also think it will hit new highs, but I don't think the Chinese FUD cycle is over just yet. This pump happening right now is very odd. I'm taking my chances and sitting this out until things calm down.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:18:19
People put in buy orders at $3000, hoping it would drop that low. It's  nice round number. You'll find those every $100, and sometimes every $50, in bunches.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:27:33
Use Uphold. You can only buy $500 each day, but it's an instant purchase from your bank. The money won't actually arrive for about a week, but when it does, it will be at the rate you purchased at. 
For example, say Wondercoin is worth $.01, and you buy $500 worth at that price. While waiting for the money to arrive, Wondercoin goes on a bullrun up to $.10. When your money arrives, you'll have $5000 since you bought Wondercoin when it was worth $.01.
Anyway, yeah, use Uphold.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:39:38
Well, China has pretty much broadcast when this dip will end. You've been given a once-in-a-lifetime gift, don't miss this chance.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:52:04
I know. I'm going to try to time the floor and buy a bunch of cheap Bitcoin then instantly send it to another exchange. I could make out like a bandit. The interesting thing is, I trade on OKCoin.cn, and no one really knows if that one is going to shut down or not.
So we'll see. I'll be watching things closely.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:35:48
And his cousin, Biggus...
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:59:55
This pump is very irrational. I don't think it can be sustained.
Whales bought in at $3000 and FOMO people jumped on the wave. Word is there were a lot of really huge orders on Polo (90 BTC+). If the whales cash out, the price will fall back again. They may be pushing for $4000 to make a quick buck.
The other thing is, Chinese exchanges are still closing. The Chinese are still going to cash out soon, so that's more downward pressure on the price to come.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:49:06
Most likely. I for one am planning to make a massive purchase in about 10 days.
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:27:40
I agree. As someone who trades on OKCoin.cn in China and Bittrex in the States, these last few weeks have been a wild ride for me, and I think we're just at the intermission.
I'll be watching everything like a hawk.
EDIT: Should also add, I'm in China myself, and I can see the sun rising out my window. We're going to find out very soon what they think about these happenings of the last 12 hours or so.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:57:51
Most other exchanges won't accept Chinese customers. You remember all the verification you had to do to get on the exchanges, right? Yeah, if you're in China, that's not an option. For Chinese, it's either the domestic exchanges, or no exchanges.
And move it to a wallet? Why would they keep Bitcoin if they can't do anything with it?
 Therefore, they have to sell.

Sure, I'll add $50. I'll let you know in about 30 mins if it clears.
EDIT: I do want to say I just noticed they no longer list the OKCoin bank info for deposits on the website, but I have their account saved in my Chinese banking app and it seemed to work fine. We'll see if the funds arrive.
EDIT 2: Yep, the money arrived. They only removed the information of the account from the public page, it's still on the website if you dig around a little.

15 more days of this. I think $2500 might be the floor, maybe even down to $2000 even.
We really don't know. All I know is I'd cash out into fiat right now (or would have a few days ago) in anticipation of the mother of all BTC sales at the end of this month. It could potentially be life-changing if you play your cards right.

@_date: 2017-09-15 21:13:53
I did the same. I didn't expect this rally, but it's going to head down again soon.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:58:13
They HAVE to sell, or they will lose it. Once the domestic exchanges close, Bitcoin will be worthless to the average Chinese person.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:57:50


Agreed. I cashed out at $3300. I'm most curious to see what the Chinese are going to do when they wake up in about 3 hours and realize their Bitcoin is suddenly worth a lot more than when they went to bed, and that they still have to get their money out of the exchanges.
Should be interesting.

I've only ever used Coinbase, Kraken, Polo, and Bittrex, so I can't speak for Bitfinex. But of those 4, Bittrex is by far the most stable, has the nicest (for me) interface, and has pretty much any coin you'd want, 2nd to Polo.

Honestly, you made the right choice. If anything, you waited too long to sell, but it's going to keep dropping and you might be able to buy 3 or 4 BTC with the money you just got from selling.
Short term loss, but potential for long term gain if you time the floor properly.

Trade their Bitcoin internationally? How? Most Chinese do not have a passport, they can't access many foreign websites without a VPN, and they have no international connections. How are they going to do anything with their Bitcoin? Look, I live in China. I trade on OKcoin.cn. Just to illustrate what I said, I can't access Bittrex without a VPN. Coinbase, Kraken, and Poloniex do not accept Chinese customers. So what are they going to do with their Bitcoin?
You are grossly misinformed about what things are like here, but that's pretty normal for this sub.
