Hopefully there’s more people buying Bitcoin with all their Christmas money!

Mine never went down?

Just from my short search, I'm probably going to use GDAX. I've currently been waiting over an hour for them to verify my ID/picture, but I know they are experiencing some issues right now so I'm not too concerned as of now. I'll just continue to track prices of the different coins.

Never too late! I've yet to have any problems with Gemini. Very easy to understand exchange (IMO). Easy to deposit and withdraw money and BTC with.

The ability to trade instantly with your deposits is what won me over to Gemini. Funds/BTC being stuck in the exchange for a few days while my deposit goes through doesn't bother me

Never too late to switch over ;)

I've seen it been asked a handful of times on here but have never seen a clear explanation. Can anyone explain how prices on GDAX are $18k while Gemini is at $17.4k? That seems like a significant difference and I thought the price of bitcoin was pretty much universal? Or is it all dependent on the exchange you are using? Cause it seems that you can just buy on Gemini where the price is low, transfer it to GDAX, then sell for a higher price there.

Yeah I'm not really boasting about how "I'm going to make so much" bla bla bla. I've mainly been explaining how I just want to test the waters and explained that I could easily lose my money if the value diminishes. My good friend (&amp; roommate) has been researching bitcoin/crypto for a while now and we talk about it from time to time, don't really talk to anyone else about it though.

Transferred more money into my Gemini account in the spur of the moment while watching the dip and was able to buy while below $15k :D

Replying to my own question. Did some researching around a bit, looks like the best way to go is a hardware wallet (which was going to be a purchase in the near future anyways).

Hey everyone! I finally pulled the trigger and bought $100 worth of bitcoin, the first of many future purchases. I’ve been talking with my parents and friends about bitcoin and while my parents are a bit skeptical about the whole thing, my good friend is tempted to get into it too. Glad I’m finally part of the bitcoin community!

Hey everyone, I'm looking to spread out my investments from just BTC to ETH and LTC as well. I am currently trading on Gemini and have an Electrum wallet. I understand Gemini does not have LTC so I would have to go to a different exchange for that. But my question is about the wallet aspect of owning different types of coins, and if one wallet can hold/send/receive different types of cryptos. Or can only certain wallets can?

$15,186 but its fluctuating +- $100
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:34:35
Yes, I'm on Gemini right now
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:28:13
Gemini is working (I'm in the US though)
