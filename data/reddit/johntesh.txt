Credit card fees are 3% (actually a little less, but estimate high).
Bit pay charges 1%.
This 20% discount is in no way based on savings, it shows the merchant's intent to hold Bitcoin and an optimism (or ignorance, depending on how you think about it) of the short term price of Bitcoin in local currency relative to today.

There are services out there like signified that charge a flat 1% or services like kount that charge a monthly fee for advanced fraud screening that can solve that problem for way cheaper than 20%. Interesting.

Some investments have different downsides than others, but bitcoin is not alone in that you can lose everything.
If a company is insolvent and can’t find a buyer, and you hold stock, you can lose the entirety of your investment. Nobody bails you out if you lose everything. 
If you buy corporate or government bonds and they default, you lose your investment and nobody is going to bail you out.
Hell, if you invest in tour own company, you may have to personally guarantee loans and have a downside of less than zero if you underperform.
Different investments have different risks, but you might be dismissing some of those risks if you think you live in a world where only bitcoin has a downside of zero.

Right, you picked three relatively safe comparisons.
If a company that is publicly traded files for chapter 7 bankruptcy, and their debts are greater than what their assets are worth, investors can be left with absolutely nothing.

Bitcoin is about my only asset that the big players don’t directly control.
The bank own my mortgage and have a lien against my house. I pay interest on that loan, and any insurance payouts I get because of damage go to my bank. They can tell me what repairs I can and can’t do, and as Wells Fargo and Chase proved in 2008, they can foreclose on me even if they can’t provide documents showing I’m in foreclosure, and the burden is on me to prove otherwise in court.
My retirement and investment accounts are fully under the control of the brokerage - I have no physical or personal possession of anything other than what is in my accounts.
My money is at the bank, and they can freeze my assets if they choose to.
My bitcoin is safely in my wallet that I control, and it’s value has gone up by multiple zeros since last January.
I’ll take this awful control of my own stuff.

This is a side note, but you can use paytrust to have all your autopay and bill Pay rules exist independently from your bank. Then, changing banks is as easy as changing your default account in paytrust.

Education - they talk differently but both sides continue to spend more and regulate more and outcomes continue to get worse
Healthcare - they both talk differently but both Medicaid/Medicare reform and Obamacare were handouts to insurance and pharma companies

@_date: 2015-09-24 22:36:56
It usually costs about a million bucks to get to the point where you even get to make the argument that the patent is invalid. Being obviously right isn't as big of a defense as most people think.
The reason you see so many patent trolls suing in one or two districts is because they pick districts whose rules heavily favor the plaintiff and put huge discovery and process burdens on the defendant. In many cases, the settlement isn't really the threat, the litigation is. That's why so many companies settle - pay $250k or I'll drag you to court and cost you a million even if I lose.

Holy crap I did not realize how unclear I was. I apologize. Also after more beer it has become hard to type. I apologize for that also.
In any event, answers:
1 - the emphasis I meant to make was on the "I", and less on the "sufficiently secure". Bank vaults are secure as fuck, and if I have a crapton of gold, I want that. With bitcoin, I can have an offline wallet that has a billion dollars in it and I don't need a bank to secure it. I can make 47 copies and keep them everywhere, and without access to certain keys, it is irrelevant if you steal one of my copies.
2 - I don't need to know the identities of the players in the market, and the transparancy's value is not relevant to the actual real world identity of the players in the market. What is relevant is that weird activity can be detected by market participants who are not directly party to the transactions at hand, and every transaction is in the block chain or else it would have no value.
That being said, there is a movement to say that if a transaction cannot be traced to a physical individual by the network, that the transaction should not be honored. This is dangerous, because this is the foundation of the idea that any anti-authority figure can no longer transact, and we all know that the stronger an authority is and the longer it is an authority, the less it can be trusted. Power corrupts. I don't think Krugman was going here, but I think the guy he quoted, Stross, was. In any event, keep in mind that they caught the silk road guys partially because they could track transactions (plus a ton of other intel).
PS - so much beer, I hope I am making sense. Thanks for reading either way.

Actually no. They were lobbying against it until they opened a distribution center  in California. The state refused to exempt them from sales tax collection in California since they had a physical presence that established nexus, so they immediately started lobbying for everyone to have to collect and remit tax everywhere. They are essentially trying to pull up the ladder behind them and use the government to impose heavier regulations on anyone who might compete with them.
You could argue that this is just how it am in the business world, and I don't even disagree with that.
But amazon certainly isn't benevolent, nor would they collect and remit of their own accord. They used their size to do exactly the opposite of that until it didn't work, and now they are lobbying to make sure even smaller businesses share the burdens their hugeness imposes.

I hope you don't mind me asking, but I rarely have an opportunity to discuss Krugman with a supporter of his without getting into huge arguments (admittedly my fault some of the time).
In any event, I have trouble making peace with the things you point out - that he is smart and widely cited, but he also frequently (or regularly or often - I don't mean to use a loaded word but I feel like any of these might be) analyzes things without expertise in the subject matter. It is this very tendency that causes him to lose credibility in my eyes, and I am curious to know how you feel about it.

From the article:








This is one of those times he really pisses me off by misrepresenting. Bitcoin is more trackable than cash, since the entire transaction history is public by necessity.

I never said anyone was coerced to stay. I said there is nowhere to go. You are coerced to pay taxes.
You are subject to pay US income tax based on the percentage of time you spend in the US and whether your employer is a US company, even if not a citizen, assuming you have a work visa. This is in addition to the one time sum you describe.
If you do not have a visa and are not a resident or citizen, you are not permitted to be here, much less work. 
Additionally, you can't renounce your US citizenship without acquiring another (which isn't simple),so you are just changing the nation to which you are paying taxes (not avoiding them).
Your argument makes no sense.
As for sea steading, you have a few problems. Almost all countries of any importance have signed UNCLOS saying that artificial islands cannot have their own territory, nor do they constitute land. Every place I've ever heard of that resembles this either still pays taxes to the country closest to them or still owes taxes according to the closest country.
And even then, suggesting that in order to avoid taxation one must move thousands of miles and invest millions of dollars just shows how coercive taxation is.
 
The argument you say is irrelevant was very relevant . I used it to show your response is full of unsupported assertions. 
By the way, assuming an air of superiority is different than having a superior argument. If you are trolling, then bravo on the good job. If you seriously think you are building an argument, that's a sad case (I don't mean to address wether you are right or wrong; I only mean to address the poor quality of your debate).

I am not the one who started the comparison. Apparently Stross is. And while you can hide your tracks, bitcoin transactions are more trackable than cash.

I am playing devil's advocate speaking for someone else here, so this may not be what he would say,  but I'll continue under the umbrella of this disclaimer.
Your argument is bad for several reasons:
1-you assert that there is a place you could be where a lack of some citizenship is not against the rules and would not result in the government taking some action against you.
2-you assert that a renouncing of one's citizenship results in the disappearance of tax burden. This is untrue at least in the US, probably elsewhere.
3-you say he wants to stay here and reap the benefits of other people's taxes, but you do not state what those benefits are. I would guess you two don't agree on an implicit list if tax benefits. Also, he may be in favor of everything from private fire service to roads to security.
4-you say that consent is implied because he doesn't do XYZ (you actually said because he doesn't renounce his citizenship, but you clearly do not know how that works so I will assume for this point that you just used something generic as an example of refusing to comply). This is like saying a kid who gives his lunch money to a bully who is threatening to hit him is done with the kid's consent. Coercion does not generate consent. This is a pretty universally accepted principal; it is why contracts signed under duress do not hold up in court.
You just had a knee jerk reaction to something you didn't like, and your response was juvenile and poor. I'm happy to continue to play devil's advocate if you like, but only if you agree to put a little thought behind what you say.

I bought from coinbase and they were a day or so late delivering my coins. Started to freak, but then got my coins. Am happy.

I know it is off topic, but that dude really has "I own karma loop... seriously" as his profile description.
How often does this occur in the real world? "Oh. My. God. Do you really own karma loop? Seriously?!?! I'm so privileged to be reading your twitter feed."
Seems like a pretty self-absorbed, dickish thing to say.

Somebody else replied to you and then you guys went down a different route, but let me answer you.
You are right. I did not make a direct rebuttal here, but I have in many other posts about the same topic across reddit. I apologize for forgetting to do so here.
Bitcoin is not like gold for many reasons that are not obvious at first, and many have long term implications only if it catches on (and these implications have no short term impact). For instance:
- bitcoin transactions and balances only exist because the network acknowleges that they exist. This means that fractional reserve banking cannot exist in its current form using bitcoin without exchanging bitcoin balances to regional currencies first, and due to bitcoin's comparative volatility (to USD) recently, this is not vialble in the short term. Also, I feel the need to point out that there has almost always been fractional reserve banking on top of gold or commodities backed currencies. This is a HUGE difference.
- bitcoin makes transfering money across borders extremely easy and instantaneous. Other than that this could be game changing, I haven't truly wrapped my mind around this. You cannot do this with anything else, and I apologize since I have no need to do this and I have no significant bitcoin holdings I am unable to speak to the true relevanace of this fact. I woud simply compare it to one who has no idea how to cook but knows when food smells delicious.
- bitcoin is built on a network of peers, and transactions are only validated once the network agrees they happened. This level of transparency has never existed before on such a massive scale - even plebes like me can analyze who is making transactions and what they are doing, to the extent I have analyzed previous transactions enough to know where the coins came from (if I feel like doing such analysis). Every transaction and every coin are public record by design.
- I can sufficiently secure my own bitcoin wallet, and I have no need of a central banking authority to store my coins. This is another "I smell it but I can't cook it" type of thing - my gold holdings (which I do have, as well as cash and stocks and other traditional investment vehicles) are at a storage facility. A bank holds my cash. A brokerage trades my trades that my investment firm advises. None of these places are necessary when everyone has direct access to the data and the decision making. This is massive and cannot be understated. They could still provide value, but they aren't *necessary* with bitcoin, and the opposite of necessity is choice. This is huge.
- The peer to peer transaction validation network is huge outside of bitcoin, and is totally unlike gold. Bitcoin could totally fail, and a p2p currency agnostic (or commodity agnostic or even generally agnostic) network could exist to provide transparency and crazy cheap validation to market transactions. I can't even begin to describe how amazing this could be without giving it way too much credit at this stage, and so I won't go much further than to say that the bitcoin network stands to challenge traditional rating agencies and trading exchanges if and when it reaches mature adoption levels. When S&amp;P and others are getting smacked around in the press for their unclear ratings policies, a public transaction history and holdings status stands to make a huge statement. On top of that, companies like paypal and western union (both billion dollar companies) are rendered essentially useless - how is there no value here?
Anyway, I have to admit that I have had access to beer tonight, and I have taken advantage of that situation. I promise that my ideas were clear before I had beer, but since I wrote them after I imbibed, I could very well have made shitty arguments here. I wish you a good night, and I hope that I have made some case for bitcoin being different than gold.
Also, speaking of gold, FUCK YES NEW ORLEANS SAINTS 42-17!
edit: spelling changed - like I said, I have had beer. Also I added emphasis to some stuff. Nothing has been deleted.

Take this recent bitcoin discussion for instance - he didn't bother to learn about the mechanics of how it works before he started comparing it directly to gold. Or the internet quote where he got the law he was quoting wrong. If he doesn't bother to learn about new things before dismissing them, how does this not erode trust over the long term? Or does he ever print retractions or corrections? Maybe I miss those because of confirmation bias.

- I didn't say banking couldn't exist. You could not lend out my bitcoin and give it back to me before it is paid back. This is the fractional reserve piece that won't work. You could pay me interest to have use of my coin for some time, and then lend it out yourself. You could also lie about whether or not you have my coins, but since all transactions are public, I could see if you moved my coins without my knowledge.
- I think the beer clouded my vocabulary. I accept your description of public vs transparent as a better way to say what I was trying to say.

I don't understand why anyone would downvote this.
BTW, Amazon is also lobbying for online sales tax.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:51:51
Fair enough, I stand corrected.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:17:21
Technically they probably use a cloud, just their own instead of amazon's.
I know it is splitting hairs, but my almost-OCD compelled me to leave this comment.

I never said bitcoin had inherent value. I said it is different than gold, then made a list of ways it is different from gold.
Edit: on mobile, got confused as to which thread this was since I can't see as I reply. I apologize. I see now this is the thread about value. I think the confusion is that I was making a case as to why there is value, not claiming the value was inherent. If the value was inherent, I would not need to enumerate these points!

Man, you are one impressive eighth grader. I say that as a compliment, but it also comes with a burden - you have the awareness to be accidentally punished by the protectiveness of society.
People like your teacher meet people of your age who are as advanced as you so rarely that they don't know how to interact with you. Perhaps many times you are treated as a child when you should be treated as an adult. Perhaps you are often smarter than the adults with whom you interact. 
You must realize that society has built a framework to take care of children. As an intelligent child, you will be patronized and mistreated, but you are paying a price that must be paid (unfortunately). Mass education tailors to (and must tailor to) the average young person.
The danger for you is that sometimes you may feel you should be treated as an adult and you do not have the sophistication you think you do, and you are in the situation because usually the opposite is true.
Just know that most of your life happens after you are an adult, and once you have control of your life things will be better. In the meantime, don't fret. Learn to forgive, learn to adjust, and remember to have fun. 
Also, congrats on being a kick ass eighth grader.
