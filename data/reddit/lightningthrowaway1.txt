You’ll need a Money Service Business license, to do custodial. To get one you’ll need to be bonded with a $25 million bond. Good luck!

Not true. The printing of physical currency, replacement of physical currency, armored trucks to move the physical currency, the Swift Network for the banks. Don’t make up “facts” without doing any research.

OMG! How did you survive this long? You would have died in the wild. It’s a shame Darwinism doesn’t work as well in humans anymore. Please do the world a favor and do not reproduce.

So those questions are going to vary from node to node, based on how many channels you have, who you’re connected to, how much is on that channel, and how much is on either side of that channel. It’s not about LND, Eclair or C-Lightning. Small nodes, with few channels, very little Bitcoin in the channels, and unbalanced channels will make a lot less than nodes with lots of channels, lots of Bitcoin, and balanced channels (as long as it has unique connections, so it is used to route payments).

No, that’s the Swift Network. Which like Bitcoin uses a lot of electricity.

So I can only speculate, but I live in San Diego, which has a large military presence. I used to workout with a trainer at a very fancy gym, and I’d always talk about Bitcoin with him. This was in 2012. My trainer had these two other clients that worked out with him together, who both worked on Black Box projects for the Department of Defense. He had told me that they had been working on Bitcoin for “Years”. He gave me their contact info and said I should reach out, which I did. However, they both refused to meet with me. Now, theoretically, they could have found it in 2010 and just contributed to the code, because they thought it was interesting, but the conspiracy theorist in me always thought that they may be part of the group that called themselves Satoshi. The truth is we will probably, never know, and it’s better that way. It is fun to speculate and theorize about with fellow Bitcoiners though :)

All this proves is he lied in court and has to pay half of what he would have had if he was Satoshi, but he’s not so he will never pay it. How dumb are you?

The Kleiman estate is suing Craig Wright because he “alleges” that he is Satoshi, and Craig and Kleiman did have a company together. I do not doubt that Craig and Kleiman knew each other and worked together on a project. Maybe even mines Bitcoins. That being said, there is a ton of evidence that Craig is not Satoshi, that he has created fraudulent documents and that he has lied on the stand in court. I started mining bitcoin early too, but I’m not claiming to be Satoshi. He is taking advantage of people who don’t know any better to make money on a forked shitcoin. There’s no evidence that he owns any actual Bitcoin. The Kleiman estate went after him, because he’s CLAIMING to have those Bitcoins, and is CLAIMING they were associated with his business with Dave Kleiman. The addresses he provided to the judge have already been proven not to be Satoshi’s. He is a con artist who is in way over his head. Even the judge thinks he’s lying, you should read the notes from the trial, they will change your opinion. The US judge is not wrong, he awarded the estate what they deserve if in fact Craig and Dave were Satoshi. They weren’t, so Craig will never move those Bitcoin, but will end up “settling” and giving the Kleiman estate some of the money he made from his Shitcoin BSV, which is good for them. As stated before I got into Bitcoin early, and know a thing or two, that you have yet to learn about the technology. I’m also an Angel investor, work with lawyers regularly and have sued people before. There is nothing about this trial that proves Craig is Satoshi or even owns Bitcoins, it’s about the fact that he says he’s Satoshi. I’ll tell you what, why don’t we make a gentleman’s bet... If Craig moves any of Satoshi’s Bitcoin I’ll send you $1k in Bitcoin. If he doesn’t you send me $1k in Bitcoin (and not that shitcoin BSV). Deal?
