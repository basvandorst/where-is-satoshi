Yes, if a school receives a donation they will not have to pay for it. The electricity not free, it is still paid for. Explain how this will effect the local electricity market?

It won't be free? It will be paid for in cryptocurrency. Our electricity is mainly run by a predominantly state owned Eskom. They hike prices as much as 20% per year, there is also a shortage of electricity and we have scheduled power cuts called "Load Shedding" because they cannot keep up with demand. I can only see this benefiting the local electricity market. Also, South Africa has some of the highest electricity rates in the world. No Bitcoin mining here....

I knew he was involved in the first transaction, never realized it was same day, thanks for that. Guess he wasn't too keen on mining. That is assuming he wasn't Satoshi himself.

Are you kidding they were sharing developments on various projects on the email newsletter. Which some of the participants were very interested in the idea. Surely he would have offered for one of those in particular to experiment with him.

Actually, I regularly stalk this subreddit and say nothing. Is this not what social media is for? I was simply throwing a question out there... you know to get some different views and maybe even the facts?  EDIT: Hindsight is 2020, SORRY

Okay this timeline does actually make more sense. I assumed there was steadily increasing interest immediately after whitepaper

Ah yes, thank you good reference from Rebit. In that case I can see how it wasn't any cheaper than legacy systems. But let's speculate, do you think it won't or cannot be done cheaper with Bitcoin? Perhaps in a future when regulatory compliance is in place?

Which companies are you referencing to?

I wouldn't say it's "Outdated" there are trades going on locally every minute.

Yes you could pocket the savings, or use it as a competitive edge.

Noted, we do have a localbitcoins price just above but will link to BitX API when we get a chance.

Do you think it is it a common route to entry on the M-Pesa mobile payments app?
@_date: 2016-05-26 20:46:14
Have you checked LocalBitcoins?

To be fair if they started sensoring exchanges and volume according to rumours or opinion, however true it might be, then that could be a very slippery slope. 
They're not promoting it, they list any exchange or coin with even the smallest of volumes. Bitconnect was right up there and most knew it to be a ponzi (most who did their research) It's up to you to do your own due dilligence.
