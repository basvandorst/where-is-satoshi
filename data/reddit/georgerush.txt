are the heartbeats going to be "grouped"?
@_date: 2014-05-20 07:25:56
That's correct!

What if there is no "last downloaded" version? Like, I need a library, and it's only on github?
@_date: 2014-05-20 09:35:21
good point, thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-20 11:13:54
no, it wouldn't

The very first step is name allocation.

I've been trying to ask these questions as well, but I was only getting a very limited response on how this works ("hash challenges" plus "wait for the whitepaper v2", as well as "we are open to other algorithms"). Hope they will figure these things out, as Proof of Storage / Retrievability / Bandwidth is not a trivial matter.
Their "hearbeat" algorithm, being not a public, recordable proof, accompanied with micropayments, will likely saturate their blockchain (2 transactions per file per minute, for example). Then again, there's probably a lot of things that we don't know about yet as they haven't been written down.

By destructive interaction with the repository I mean any operation that changes its state (pulling a repository, is a non-destructive operation). I agree, might be not the best choice of word. Let's use "mutating" and "non-mutating". Updating a ref in a git repo is something that changes its state, therefore it goes onto a blockchain.
The configuration data of a repo, indeed, goes on the blockchain for a permanent record.

Thomas, it is not the history of the repository itself that goes onto a blockchain, but the history of destructive interaction with the repository (reference updates), and other important elements such as blockchain-commited name allocation, permission management, etc.

should the storage drop your file if you stop heartbeating and paying when you close your laptop's lid?
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:39:03
If you stop heartbeating (and therefore, paying), how's the redundancy going to prevent these multiple nodes from dropping your data? Also, if you failed to pay for heartbeats, should you also be booted? (if somebody was merely replaying your heartbeats?)

It's imperative that an actual functioning network will have this system. I am hoping to have a minimal version of it in the first release (by the end of the summer), and extend it later if necessary; but for now, I posted it as a "stretch" goal. If I won't be able to complete it by the end of the project, the first test network will launch without it, but the first live production most definitely will start with it. 
I am having this discussion about incentives with peers of mine and those interested in the project and will be summarizing the first draft sooner or later.

Another point about the "upstream". GitHub is no longer just an upstream. It is *the* source of 90% of all open source libraries and tools. Whenever it goes down, what I am concerned is that the vast majority of publicly available open source goes with it. I don't really know about you, but I find myself in the need to use or read libraries that I am not yet using fairly often.

When github goes down, all dependencies you need to fetch do.

wild guess: something to do with space (satellite?)

What's the purpose? I have a validated account on CaVirtEx but haven't traded for over a year... and looks like I either have to trade or close the account and then if I want to come back, I have to re-validate my identity. What a move...
