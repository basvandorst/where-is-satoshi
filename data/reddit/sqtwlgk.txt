Well, nodes would be largely split (e.g., they would ban nodes providing blocks that are "invalid" for them), so we would not only have blockchain I and blockchain II but also p2p network I and p2p network II respectively. 
This way, one would send tx_1 to the former, and double-spending tx_2 to the latter. As long as fees are the same, and as long as miners honor the first seen rule, chain I would pick tx_1 and chain II would pick tx_2.
But you are right: Automatic transaction replayers may ruin it (similar as with the malleability attacks), and we may then need to attempt the process several times before succeeding.
There is a better alternative, in case you had post-fork coinbases (or other outputs derived from them), then you would just include in the transaction an input from these, so that the transaction could not be replayed (as it would be invalid in the other chain).

Well, an advantage of Bitcoin transactions is that you can evaluate their validity independently of the state of the blockchain; they stand on their own. You check that the structure is valid, conditions are fulfilled, signatures are correct; then, the only thing to verify for including inside a block is that its inputs exist and are unspent (plus they verify lock time and sequence field).
But, of course, replay attacks could be a problem. So we could make transactions capable of querying the state of the blockchain, to solve this. Notice that there are important drawbacks though: Validation becomes more complex and SPV gets weakened.

Yes, transactions can in principle be "replayed" on both chains. To prevent this, senders need to *spend* in one chain and *double spend* in the other chain. To do this, they can:
 - Send with the "hash inspector" smart contract so that the tx is valid in one chain but not in the other.
 - Simultaneously send conflicting transactions to one chain and the other chain, and hope that one is included in the one chain first and the other in the other. Since a few days ago, there seems to be people automatically replaying unconfirmed transactions, though, so this may no longer be an option.
 - Taint the account with an *etherbase* (mining issuance, analogous to Bitcoin's *coinbase*) from one of the chains, or by receiving a transaction from a deep-confirmed double spend. Ethereum uses *accounts* instead of UTXOs, so a single reception, a partial difference, taints the entire account balance. The whole balance in the chain where it is largest can then be moved to a new account.
All this is for pre-fork coins only. Subsequent transactions are unaffected.

@_date: 2016-08-01 10:36:04
In Bitcoin, transactions are largely independent of the blockchain. Not in Ethereum: You can make conditional transactions inspect the block hash at a certain height and compare it to some checkpoint specific to the fork where you want to include your transaction. This was rather complex, though: Neither Coinbase nor BTC-E did it properly and in consequence they got drained in the *classic* chain.
In Bitcoin, the forking chain would need to change the transaction format, ideally. If not, there is still a *painful* solution: Spend every standing UTXO to a set of addresses A on one chain and to a different set B on the other chain.

Segwit does not need a hard-fork and instead it is currently being proposed as a soft-fork. There will be no problem "if not all miners upgrade" because the change will only be enforced once all miners upgrade.
There is a point after 95% of miners have expressed their support that the new rule "activates". What I mean is that, previous to that point, the validity of witness segregation is not enforced (so no one should attempt to use it) like today, and after that point, segregated witnesses are validated by everyone, and so can be safely used.
If the remaining 4% of miners still refuse to upgrade after the grace period after activation, there still be no fork, because they would still see the new blocks as valid. They will not mine invalid segwit txs either. They would nevertheless want to upgrade anyway, in order to avoid being tricked by fake blocks (new blocks with invalid witnesses) and to get the fees of segwit txs, as demand for old-style txs plummets.

You mean the *payer* prefer to use it. Yes. But I think it is advantageous for the *payee* too: 
In my case, I collect multiple payments in my hot wallet, then I periodically consolidate some of these to my cold wallet. With LN, however, I would have no hot wallet other than the LN channel, so I will "consolidate" in just one transaction and I will save on fees.
Also, if my payers can pay me without friction, they will probably do it more often, more eagerly and with a better experience.
Transactions consisting of non-interactive sending to addresses were never supposed to be a good (safe, private) payment solution anyway. Payment requests to LN are much better: instant, more private.
@_date: 2016-04-12 21:48:36
Again, you ignore the fact that all these (segwit, LN, Shnorr signatures) have been proposed opt-in. They require no one to upgrade their software.
On the other hand, you require that **everyone** upgrades in 28 days.
You do not mine if you do not build your blocks: Stratum only permits you to rent your hashing equipment in exchange for a reward. And you do not use Bitcoin if you do not run a node: If someone else builds the transactions and you only do the signing, then that other party is using Bitcoin in your behalf (it can be in exchange for a fee e.g., Multibit, for ads on their website/app, for data-mining your privacy, for the possibilty of scamming you, etc.).

You are probably right, but I am not that certain. If I have all the 21M BTC, other people would be obviously using other forms of money, but they could still desire to posses some of my bitcoins. If I prove that I will not flood the market (e.g., by long time locking most of them) maybe I would be able to sell some of them and so start distributing it again. 
Notice that Ripple started fully premined, with no time locking, and on the shadow of Bitcoin's dominance, and yet it reached a non-negligible worth.

There is no central planning in the 75% discount. It is what results from taking into account the actual validation savings when using the new logic for scriptPubKey hashing. 
The fact that segwit results in a 1.75x capacity increase is a coincidence. No malleability and more pruning are its main benefits.

Of course they are! The way Bitcoin works, full nodes are not able to validate if miners have *followed* a certain set of rules. They can only tell if this set of rules or **a more restrictive subset** of it have been *respected*.
If you take the first release by Satoshi, it will not connect to the p2p network or handle reorgs (the bdb locks issue), but it will still fully validate the blockchain.
I insist: My unupgraded node will receive no segwit outputs and so it will still **fully** validate txs in which I am the payee. My inability to understand P2WPKH or P2WSH txs is irrelevant to me; thinking that it is suggests being obsessed with other people's money.

Bitcoin is nowhere "close to anonymous". This is why mixers and joinmarket exist, and stealth addresses and confidential transactions are proposed.
Of course blacklists can deanonymize users: Once your coins get "tainted" you are either forced to reveal proof of your funds (and thus your identity) or kiss them goodbye.
Also, pools can be anonymous; more than this, we **need** that some of them (currently ~10%) stay anonymous to resist censorship. If you do not think that we need anonymous block builders, then please stop using Bitcoin and use something more efficient (e.g., like Ripple). Hearn has very coherently taken this route.

This is false, strictly speaking. I can ask a third party to look up whether I got paid. She will be acting on my behalf on the p2p system; she may lie to me by hiding payments to me (very easily) or by faking them (harder). These are impossible with a full node.

Do not you find suspicious that the guys "SCREAMING FOR bigger blocks" are the same that make uneconomical uses of the blockchain? Of course they do! They fear that larger fees will stop their piggybacking capability. As I said, I just want to know when someone pays me. Consequently, I am willing to verify everyone others' coins, because one day they may end up in my wallet. If someone wants to put factoms, satoshi dice, or Fidelity stuff, then fine, we cannot stop them as long as they pay the fee, but do not let them whine when they find no more space in MY blockchain for their uneconomical uses that externalize their costs to the node operators.

Clams is a good example, yes. 
Notice though that they did not exactly checkpoint a UTXO set, but did something a bit more complex: They selected only outputs spendable with a signature, then they cumulated them by key hash, and finally applied a threshold function ("dust balances" got zero and the others got a fixed quantity K).

@_date: 2016-04-24 15:06:13
This is not guaranteed though. "Redistribution" soft-forks have been under discussion and I do not think that they are that improbable.
Political ones, like preventing Satoshi from selling his 1M-coin stash, may never get enough support (even when the risk involved could severely damage Bitcoin: not only its founder quits, but he  does it by crashing the exchange price). 
However, it could be done because of technical reasons, e.g., ECDSA in our curve gets broken: We would release a new public-key system, but Satoshi's untouched pay-to-pubkey coinbases would become spendable by anyone, so we would soft-fork them out.

@_date: 2016-04-07 09:36:29
I think it would be a dichotomy between *cold storage* and the LN. 
Past the one-time locking cost, it is much more useful to have the coins on the LN (nearly free txs, O(n) scalability, instant confirmations) than siting untouched on a hot wallet. I mean, the only disadvantage in LN is that you need to periodically re-extend the channels (for free), so the main reason to exit it would be the extra safety of cold storage.
This is more than a theory: Have a look at joinmarket and how, even now in its incipient state, and even with its limitations, there is this Tragedy of the Commons where you can coinjoin nearly for free. 
@_date: 2016-04-07 11:36:39
It is indeed a bit scary, maybe even to the point where miners should be rationally willing to block the LN-enabling soft-forks, probably.
On the other hand, we'll still have a significant block subsidy for a few more halvings (*significant* relative to the typical currency velocity). After that, I guess that enough long-term, cold-storage-desiring *hodlers* will still be willing to pay sizable fees to miners in exchange for the extra security (thus routing on-chain their fresh on-LN income). Or maybe on-chain notarization, via OP_RETURNs, will be able to source enough fees.
But if they do not, then our last resource will be some sort of hashing assurance contracts.
@_date: 2016-04-20 09:22:07
Read again, please. While merged mining is still insecure (50% or less), sidechains need an alternative, which is often done with a federation of block signers.
These are public and visible. If half of these are on the same jurisdiction we are already pwned. If they are in two jurisdictions, then it just takes a cooperation agreement (which can be expected, especially if they do no blacklisting).
Maybe, a solution based on trusted computing with *remote attestation* could help them stay semi-trusted and operate anonymously at the same time.
@_date: 2016-04-07 21:36:15
Yes, secret soft-forks are possible. But then, they either still need some sort of central coordination, some cartel behavior (impossible in a permissionless system as there is no way to punish pseudonymous defectors), or are done by a 51% party.
If any of these two are still happening in the far future, then we would conclude that Bitcoin failed.
@_date: 2016-04-01 06:09:14

The core point is that there is still unfalsifiable proof that tons of energy were spent to create them. This is scarce and so valuable.
A blockchain can be brought to a halt and restarted later, with fee mining / hashing assurance contracts / other mechanism we will develop in the few next centuries. Those bitcoins' worth will depend on the other, unspecified conditions of the hypothetical scenario. Have a look at my reply to cinnapear.

Unlike the other commenters, I think that you are doing it right. The Trezor is considered to be the most secure wallet today. Therefore, you should only diversify a bit for convenience, but the Trezor is already quite convenient.
The most important thing is to secure the backup of the seed. For this, I would have a cryptosteel, paper wallets, etc.
Other than that, and to be extra safe, maybe you could consider having two Trezors (or when the Ledger Blue is available, one of these) and have keep one fully locked with the bulk of coins and the other more accessible but with less coins.

It is just the other way around. LN requires just a hot wallet and is not fundamentally different from the payment request protocol. For most connectivity topologies, it is as censorship resistant as the lower level network.
On the contrary, sidechains with asymmetrical pegging are somewhat less secure, and while their merged mining does not catch up, they require a federation with risks of fallibility and regulatory capture.

I agree. I am not fully convinced that Bitcoin will be able to survive every political attack, e.g., in a scenario like you describe.
I do not think, however, that mining is as important as you say. Miners ought to validate the rules to get the reward, and incentives ensure this process; they have no power in choosing the future evolution of the rules to validate. Maybe the soft-forking mechanisms -in which miners signal their readiness by voting- has given the impression that their votes matter very much, when they do not. The soft-fork is just the smoother path: If they refuse a necessary soft-fork, for X reasons and against overwhelming consensus, then we can hard-fork them out, and if they still refuse to secure the (one and only economically valid) blockchain with the hashing power they possess, we can change the algorithm used. 
^(notice also that soft-forks necessarily involve some central planning, against the decentralized nature of the project, and are not incentive compatible 
The political attack, on the other hand, can be more devastating. If on-chain security plummets, it may do it for reasons that do not depend on the hashing algorithm used, and we may hear advocates for "BIP513", as you say. It might even be more subtle than that: Notice that the blockchain has no bitcoins: The unit is just an abstraction. Therefore, BIP513 could propose that the 21M limit is formally kept (changing it is often mentioned as "an impossible change") BUT to keep security we introduce a very small rate of demurrage which, in practice, keeps a small constant block subsidy (increasing, in the internal integer representations).
The base problem is what we consider to be a *reference implementation*. Setting up a fully independent *libconsensus* should be our first priority.

As long as they get a fee (multibit), advertising (most web-based) and data mining (most), "light wallet" providers will go on milking the cow and will not try to lie to you. However, Electrum, Mycelium, and similar work just because of irrational altruism. Other than private-data mining, they have no incentive to continue serving you and, in fact, they may get at some point bribed to hide payments to you.
Even more, if we one day reach a point where only miners run full nodes and Electrum servers, then they can instamine a billion bitcoins shared between them. As long as such sharing is just, they are incentivized to keep it secret from any external user.

Adam's definition is broad as it just concentrates on the proof of work, not on the transaction security. 
I think that Bitcoin is unlikely to fail because of transaction insecurity, because stakeholders' interest is in keeping it. If the token becomes worthless, then it will not be secure to transact it (lack of incentives), but as long as it stays valuable at the core, we will make sure that transactions in it be made safe, one way or another (notice that this argument goes against the security of meta-coins and colored coins). In practice, there are several solutions possible: e.g., hashing assurance contracts, stake-bonded proof-of-work (like in proof of activity  or, if all these fail, the simple fact that a run to the exchanges makes on-chain transactions skyrocket and so immediately restores the security, i.e., it has a negative feedback loop, albeit a volatile one.

I do not think that this is the case. Lightning can possibly more-or-less work in different topologies, but it will be stronger and more robust in a scale-free one. It will certainly not "behave the same" in any of them.

Absolutely not. That is just degree heterogeneity. There is no critical link, and less than 10% of the nodes are dependent on any single node. And this is risk trivially solved by a "make at least two channels" recommendation.

That is not *free market*. Free market is quite unequivocally defined as a system where supply meets demand purely with the internal market dynamics, and *free* from any external forcing or control. It implies, as such, that at least a local equilibrium is met.
By its min-fee policy, Antpool is actively renouncing to part of their potential supply contribution, thus acting (Pareto) sub-optimally. They can enforce it because each individual miner is a monopolist of the blocks they mine. That monopolist price will coincide with the free-market price only if all the suppliers are profit maximizers.
In a case of perfect competition, Antpool will get out-competed eventually, but until then the price is out of its equilibrium, therefore the *market* is not *free*.

No, he did not. He *intended* to scale up capacity via nSequence and high-frequency transaction replacement, years before any size discussion.

Those are just nodes with high connectivity degree. They are not essential, except for a handful of nodes.
I think that terminological rigor is important, especially because a hub-and-spoke LN could become quite fragile. Even if there were hubs, there would be nothing like banks (as typical buttcoiners would claim), I agree. However, a coalition of LN hubs could attempt to prioritize/deprioritize certain types of transactions and raise fees, and even though LN is permissionless and so those nodes could be circumvented, the cost for doing that could be significant if on-chain fees are high. This is not a problem in a scale-free, hubless LN, which has natural circumvention for the vast majority of routes i.e., it *percolates*.

*Effectively zero* means strictly positive though relatively insignificant.
Why? One possibility is altruism. Notice that some miners still today include transactions with zero fees, even though they very slightly increase their orphaning risk. In the same way, we may see that some LN nodes will route transactions for free.
But this is not strictly necessary and we may be able to see that, even considering only rational behavior. Since LN is permissionless and nearly everyone has a few coins in a hot wallet, it could be a Tragedy of the Commons, where routing through LN with any strictly positive but insignifcant fee is acceptable, because the alternative of leaving the coins just sitting in the wallet is worse.

Sidechains are supposed to be permissionless, with no soft-forking involved in the main-chain.
In what you describe, both chains are part of a new set of rules that coinbases 12.5 btc per block in the main chain and 12.5 per block in the sidechain. This requires a soft-fork and the sidechain part of the "reference implementation". However, at this point, if you are already officializing the sidechain, it would be better to soft-fork to fully enforce its rules (thus no SPV pegging but full security) and treat the sidechain blocks as extended blocks of the main chain.
If you do not do this and instead permissionlessly release a sidechain that releases 12.5 btc coinbases, the total supply would increase. Since nothing stops people from doing this, the supply would become effectively unlimited (in the whole multi-chain ecosystem). Because this would damage bitcoins' worth, I expect that people will trace coins' origin and value main-chain ones at 1btc and sidechain ones at ~0btc, with a continuous spectrum between these points for mixed origins, thus breaking the fungibility.

Larger hashing power does not improve the gains, it only reduces the variance. Nevertheless, you can minimize the variance by mining at multiple pools, in proportions equal to their global hashrate share. Antpool is not big enough to do a selfish-mining attack either. In conclusion, now that Segwit killed Asicboost, it makes no sense to mine at Antpool, not even for purely profit-maximizing reasons.

It is exactly the other way around. Bitcoin is **peer-to-peer**. Peers need to be able to keep up; they get "crippled" precisely when hit with too many transactions that they cannot process. This is especially bad when those transactions are of little or no economic value (so that they do not give back value to the network). Also, in this sense, "attack" is indistinguishable from "inefficiency".
With emails, we can use centralized spam filters (or decentralized ones that do not need global consensus). With Bitcoin, however, those are not available and so *limited capacity* is the only way that we have to defend the network from unlimited transactional pollution.

Sorry to break the circlejerk, but I do not think that ShapeShift does any good to Bitcoin (to be clear: I am not happy that it got "hacked", and I am that no customer funds got taken).
ShapeShift spams the blockchain with value-reducing transactions. Having multiple blockchains each with their internal tokens is less secure and more expensive that a single blockchain (or a main chain with two-way-pegged merge-mined side-chains).
Altcoins are good for testing, but if their tokens are valuable, then this can lead to unlimited inflation. Being subjectively valued, I do not think that the worth of unlimited inflation cryptocurrency as a whole can be strictly larger than zero. Even more strictly, *unlimited supply* is probably worthless too (because of the availability of limited-supply alternatives; e.g., chrysopoeia is infeasible).
@_date: 2016-04-15 18:12:31
Not the same.
It depends a lot on the other conditions of that hypothetical scenario. What is clear is that we are far in the future, when all the 21M have already been mined, and that I somehow managed to solely and entirely hold the bags in a post-Bitcoin era. If people are still running full nodes and I can make a credible commitment to transaction security, then the bitcoins could have some collectible value, for historical reasons.
Or they could even function again as money. Let us suppose that Bitcoin's successor, NewCoin (you could also call it ClassicCoin or Ether) is centrally planned and unlimited supply, but it is well managed with *incorruptible governance*^(TM) and has gone to the Moon. As all good money, it is regularly used for "illegal" purposes. However, at some point, the severely weakened World government regains significant power and strikes back, attacking NewCoin's weakest point: its central software repo and its dev team. If I managed to stay anonymous, I can time-lock most of my stash and distribute again the bitcoins to serve as truly censorship resistant money.
This implies no hard-forks, no soft-forks, no newer releases of a *reference implementation*. Just plain 1.0 digital cash, and the only evolvability in the form of side-chains or payment channels.
@_date: 2016-04-08 07:34:56
Oh, and in many cases it is more than a Schelling point as there would be other incentives. E.g., if the tacit soft-fork is for 20BTC subsidy instead of 25, there would be incentive to revert to 25. If it is excluding some competitive-fee-paying transactions (SD case), there would be incentive to re-include them.
@_date: 2016-04-25 08:24:49
Correct! They are just abstractions. This is also why we can properly say things like: coins going to or coming from the LN or a sidechain (and these are actual bitcoins, not IOUs, nor 1:1 pegged altcoins, e.g., *RSK roots* **are** bitcoins).
Even more generally, [Adam suggested that all altcoins are actually bitcoins]( That one is a good argument on why we will always converge to a single valuable cryptocurrency unit. It is essentially game theoretic: altcoins can only bootstrap by being overpriced but, being fungible, rational players would refuse overpriced coins. Interestingly, it is an argument that does not involve any network effects or first-mover advantages.

I think that either cryptocurrency ultimately succeeds or it fails. But if it succeeds, then a single coin is a stable attractor (it is more secure and less expensive) and so there is no spontaneous mechanism where Bitcoin 2.0 could succeed Bitcoin, unless externally forced (e.g., regulation).
This is not a Myspace vs. Facebook situation: Bitcoin users/stakeholders are heavily invested, many to a degree near fanaticism, also Bitcoin evolvability is nearly unlimited in permissionless ways.
Also, if Bitcoin 2.0 where to succeed Bitcoin, then it would seem plausible that Bitcoin 3.0 would be able to succeed Bitcoin 2.0, and so on *ad eternum*. This would undermine the store of value property of these tokens and may even reduce them to effectively worthless.
@_date: 2016-04-14 20:39:03
I am not sure of what you mean here. The point of LN is to send multiple payments both ways between many participants without the need to settle anything but, eventually, the cumulative differences.
Even then, the actual on-chain settlement needs only to take place when one party stops cooperating in the interactive protocol. But there is no gain in stopping the cooperation and it can go on indefinitely. Therefore, I expect that most hot-wallet coins will be on the LN and that on-chain settlements will only be needed for cold wallets.

I think it is a conceptual error to call RSK as a different thing from BTC. There are no *bitcoins* in the blockchain, just spendings of valued inputs that allow creation of outputs showing that -minus fee- they sum equal (or ZKP of that for CT). And just as bitcoins are an abstraction, we can properly say that they *go to* or *come from* the lightning network and that they *go to* or *come from* a sidechain. It makes sense, and it stresses the argument that it is better to have only one token of value with limited supply.
For regular addresses, one could still argue that there is a certain meaningful notion of units that are possessed by definite entities, and say that transactions send coins from a payer to a payee. But for locking contracts this is no longer the case.

In that block constitution is, essentially, a monopolistic process in which a single party, namely the pool operator, decides what can get inside and what cannot. Notice that, if that party ever reaches 51% of the hashrate, it can impose arbitrary censorship and restrictions: Freedom in Bitcoin is not a given but it is in a fragile situation that strongly depends on no party achieving that 51% monopolistic state (the way proof-of-work works, only the longest chain matters, so 51% is 100%).
Anyway, and independently of this, *free market* has a much more specific meaning that implies that prices (feerates, in our case) reach a market equilibrium. Antpool behavior is, as I mentioned, Pareto sub-optimal, and so it clearly situates the fee market out of that equilibrium. This would be true even if Antpool did not infringe any law or violated any Human Right.

Add as much redundancy as you want, but this does not change the fact that nodes have no incentive in telling you the truth and so, once you outsource your security, you are no longer using Bitcoin. You are just keeping the keys for the signatures, but the other parties are using Bitcoin in your behalf, and at this point you are better using something like Ripple. Ripple with high redundancy and diverse, independent nodes has the same security guarantees (weak), with better performance.

Yes. And nobody will include them (probably, even produce them) before the softfork activates. So when there are blocks including them, it will mean that there is 95% of miners at least (probably near 100%) ready to evaluate the validity of the  segregated witnesses.

If the sidechain is offering a reward, then this either breaks fungibility or eventually leads to unlimited supply. Since both of these are value damaging, I do not think that many would be using such sidechains.
If the reward is split, yes, then there is no longer a supply problem. I do not see the advantage though: *25 btc + main-fees on the main-chain and side-fees on the sidechain* is equivalent to *12.5 btc + main-fees on the main-chain and 12.5 btc + side-fees on the sidechain*. The point of merged mining is precisely that it is done *for free* while mining the other chain (i.e., that the sidechain accepts main-chain proof-of-work solutions as valid for its sidechain blocks). The security is the same. 
Additionally, the reward halving would require a soft-fork that is incentive incompatible. Miners could mine 12.5-btc coinbases today if they wanted to, but they do not. This would thus be acceptable only if the sidechain was made as good as the main-chain, i.e., part of the *reference implementation*. But at this point it would make no sense to have the security weakening implicit in the sidechain pegging: If the sidechain is *official*, then it would be better to have it as extended blocks with full security.

Well, isn't his how they do it with Blockstack, without the Merkle trees?
A key point is how you prevent abuse. If operations are free and unlimited, then attackers can spam the registering party. But I guess we could require every participant to be on the Lightning Network and contribute to the on-chain registration fee (to be done every 24h by an untrusted, freely replaceable operator). As more participants join in, the tx fee contribution is decreased for everyone by updating their channels.
If in the future everyone uses the LN and demand for cold storage is insignificant (e.g., people update their channels from their hardware wallets every 30 days in a decently secure way) then maybe this might even become the main source of security, barring hashing assurance contracts or other esoteric stuff. I recall an essay some time ago that argued how the worth of on-chain notarization was the "backing" of Bitcoin's value (I do not necessarily agree, but it is interesting how it avoids the need to refer to the subjective theory).

I have used both. Bisq is much easier and faster:
1. Click on the "buy" button (cheaper is better, but any offer in the list will do it)
2. Send the agreed amount to the account number displayed
3. Receive the bitcoins
In Coinbase, instead, you need to fill your personal information, then do a verification, then wait until it gets rejected, then re-submit again the documents (I ignore why it never works the 1st time), then submit selfie with the documents, then wait unitl it gets approved, then deposit fiat, then click on "buy", then you receive the bitcoins.

*Any of the advantages* is probably too strong. 
I already trust my friend a lot, so I connect to his Electrum server. I always do it through tor, though, and I keep several Electrum wallets for separate things (he has some opportunities to decloack me, through context, but these are not much worse than through blockchain analysis). I accept that I am not using Bitcoin: my friend is doing it for me.
The moment he introduced Bitcoin to me, and told me how to download the software with the correct genesis block, there was already some trust required.
My friend can hide transactions in which I am the payee, but then I have that other friend, who also happens to run an Electrum server. He is also an enemy of my first friend, and unlikely to collude with him.
I am willing to accept an increased risk of privacy loss and payment hiding. It would be still very difficult to steal my coins from me: I know the right genesis, checkpointing at the time of first download, and approximate rate of growth. Only miners could reasonably try to steal from me, but here I rely on piggybacking on my both friends, independent API providers, and you. You would ring the bell if you observed that a significant amount of proof of work started showing in an invalid header chain; I know this and I freeride on this. The fact that, as I understand it, running Bitcoin is less important for me that for you (and for other stakeholders bigger than myself) prevents the Tragedy of the Commons and lets me go on with my free riding.
My security in this setting is somewhat weaker than if I were a peer on the network, I agree, but I would argue that I definitely get *some of the advantages* of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-22 20:51:13
What miners "support" is irrelevant. Miners exist because of the need to create a **valid** blockchain, not the other way around.
Miners are not supposed to vote. The abuse of the *signaling for majority readiness* mechanism, which was initially designed to make soft-forks quicker and safer, has actually led us to the current mess, by giving the false impression that miners are actually voting on which rules will be valid, instead of just respecting them.

I think that this is quite unlikely. The current network of payments in Bitcoin is quite close to a  which structurally does not have any hubs. The LN will *naturally* mimic that network. Why? Because of an effect known as *preferential attachment*: People will establish channels, preferentially, with their most common payers and payees; this is what makes the most sense.
Hub formation will not happen, because it is suboptimal. Lots-of-channels implies locking lots-of-coins in the LN. People (and entities) that have lots of coins prefer to have them in cold storage, hence unavailable for use in the LN. "But, but, passive income": No. LN is permissionless so interest rates will be very close to 0, as liquidity floods the network just for the convenience of being ready to use it. 
Notice, in particular, that keeping a channel is something feasible with a hardware wallet. In that case, you would not route other people's payments, but you would only need to sign whenever you send, receive, or renew the channel.
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:11:04
Very nice. Just a small nit pick on network topology: You paint it as if there would be 3 categories. In fact, we will most likely have a continuous spectrum of connectivity degrees, with no classes.
LN topology will most probably mimic today's payment network topology, which is scale-free. Why? Because this is how it is most efficient: You would typically create channels with your most frequent payers and payees. If the LN is scale-free, there would be no *hubs* (hub-and-spoke is a completely different topology). There would be, indeed, more connected nodes and less connected ones, but without any abrupt changes that would separate them in different classes.

Hardware wallets are a useful protection for cases when your computer might be compromised. If I want to send 1 BTC to your address, I will confirm this exact action, 1BTC-&gt;r2doesinc's-addy, on my HW itself. A compromised computer can, at most, censor this tx and not transmit it.
With a centralized-website-fake-DEX, however, it offers little use, though. The HW has no way to authentify the smart contract. The instant when you deposit from the Ledger to the smart contract, simple JS injection can steal the entire amount.

To the extent that they may be using the network like the rest of us, yes, of course. But not further that this.


They are paid a reward for doing so. If they stopped, others would take their place. More than this: Mining is, essentially, ephemeral. Hashrate changes very quickly and, in general, having mined blocks in the past gives little predictability about doing so in the future.


No. Signaling is about readiness; it has little to do with voting (also because of what I mentioned above). Hashrate supermajority signaling does not assume that those that mined before will be the same that mine later, only that they constitute a representative sample of "already upgraded vs. not yet upgraded". This way, they minimize the disruption associated with softfork activation (principally, stale blocks), but it is not strictly necessary for that. Have a look at BIP8.




Maybe I could have worded it better: There, it was not a personal *you* but a generic *you*; notice the hypothetical.
Still, I would "argue that proof of work does not play a role in the consensus and enforcement of rules". Not even *partially*, together with other groups. Proof of work is about selecting the tip or, in other words, ordering the transactions, and this is it. Work that is done according to a more restrictive set of rules is indistinguishable from work that is done with the full consensus ruleset, and work that is done according to a different ruleset is not even considered in the system.
Softfork activation on past signaling is a safety net, not a necessary mechanism.


Well, this is indeed being empirically verified. Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond and all those other shit forks evidence that yes, that a tiny minority can split, give some tiny value to their shit-token, and miners will pop up to secure that chain. Miners matter only to the extent that they are users too, but not because of their mining.
@_date: 2016-04-09 13:34:06
True for non-mining nodes, but probably not for poorly connected miners. They will have to renounce to the fees of segwit transactions and make risky evaluations on whether or not to mine on top of segwit blocks.
Soft-fork to 1.5 - 1.7MB is fine because these are safe, but e.g., segwit/extended block soft-fork to a 20MB size would not be safe, even if opt-in in nature.

Computing power does not "vote" in Bitcoin. Readiness signaling is just a safety net for quicker activation of softforks (there are other options like UASF-flagday).
Bitcoin Cash is not properly a "hard fork" either. A "hard fork" is an upgrade mechanism that, by design, requires widespread consensus, which Bitcoin Cash clearly did not achieve. So, as a hard fork, it is a failed one. The so-called Bitcoin Cash blocks were invalid for every existing implementation of Bitcoin (even the "unlimited" ones).
Also, Segwit does not "split transactions into two segments"; it just changes the signature verification algorithm (amount is signed too, linear-not-quadratic hashing). Its objective was, primarily, to remove transaction malleability, but it also increased the blocksize.
With Segwit, Bitcoin increased the blocksize limit just like Bitcoin Cash. The disagreement was thus not in the increase nor in the technical details (technical Segwit criticism was mostly FUD), so the disagreement that created Bitcoin Cash was principally political.
It is not fair, in my opinion, to view it as "two sides in conflict" where Roger in one side and Blockstream in the other have opposing views and end up splitting. If that was the case, and that was the correct vision of the Bitcoin system, we could get rid of nodes and mining and make those central governors sign blocks instead.

Most reliable: Multiple hubs will be necessarily more reliable than just one, if only for the increased redundancy.
Fastest: Hops are instant, so one hop is practically indistinguishable from multiple hops.
Cheapest: Now, this is the hard part. I guess that, before people start routing their cold wallets online to use them for LN, they will start reusing the funds they already have online in their hot wallets. These resources are rather limited, and they are also fairly distributed. Because of this, and because setting up a new LN node is permissionless, this may end up in a Tragedy of the Commons, where fees are tiny and the economies of scale that would centralize to just one big hub are never actually found. We are seeing this in the joinmarket, which is in a way a good model for LN adoption. 
At a different level, but still similar, mining pools could also use economies of scale to centralize to just one (or three, if they want to avoid the 51% scare), but they have become a zero-sum operation to the point where, for the last few years, we have stayed close to -but at a safe distance form- that situation.
However, if we end up with OneBigHub, this would probably be still a rather benign situation. Privacy would be less than for the case of a distributed LN, but not different than on-chain without coinjoin, especially if you mask your IP address. The monopolistic operation cannot produce a rent either: If fees go above operation costs, a cheaper competitor will appear and become the new OneBigHub. And finally, and importantly, censorship would remain infeasible: A censorship attempt would drive the community to a freer OneBigHub. There is no way to stop this, and notice that, because there is no trust in the hub required, OneBigHub can even operate fully anonymously.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:47:44
Yes. Prices in BTC vary a lot, and this is guaranteed to be always the case, because bitcoin is deflationary. Nevertheless, in a *real* economic system that is permanently out of equilibrium, prices can never reach a stable value (no matter what unit you price them with).

I insist: It is not.


Not necessarily. First of all, you will only be able to send $10k if you indeed have $10k, which implies that your direct channels, those to your nearest neighbors, your peers, have a capacity of at least $10k. Of course, those will be able to route-through only in case they have other channels other than the one to yourself. But payments can take multiple paths, so there is a quick dilution effect: Let us say that your $10k is branched to 5 your direct peers; at first degree, each have to route only $2k. If, now, they have each 4 other peers, they would need a capacity of only $500 each, at second-degree neighborhood. And it can be even less with the dilution at third-degree. It is the same, but in the opposite sense, for the receiving end, for which the $10k aggregate only at the ending point.
So, in this example, you can perfectly route $10k payments between any two nodes in the network, even if there are no channels with more than $2k capacity, and no hubs with more than 5-degree connectivity. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:28:38
There is an extremely important distinction between a *highly connected node* and a *hub*. A hub is essential for routing for the majority of routes; a centrally connected node in a scale-free network is not.
An example of hub-and-spoke is airline routes. A majority of the routes depend on a handful of hubs. This is fragile, but unavoidable, because the links (flights) are costly and strongly dependent on high occupation for profitability. In contrast, a hub-less network is the physical internet. Links are cheaper and, quite importantly, there is an incentive in not saturating them, so the result is a more redundant, more robust network.

I see. So without any need of signaling, when they see that SatoshiDice transactions are being systematically refused for a long time, they can soft-fork them out (concrete example irrelevant; SatoshiDice spam non-mining nodes but do no harm to miners as long as their txs pay enough fees).
One problem I see with that, though, is that regular nodes --the economical majority-- will not be enforcing that soft-fork. Therefore, it would be a for-most-practical-purposes soft-fork more than a theoretical soft-fork. What I mean is that real soft-forks need a hard-fork to revert them, but tacit, secret soft-forks can be dropped at any time; incentives would prevent the risk of a secret hard-fork in this case: Even after tacit no-SD agreement, if one block then appears with a SD transaction in it, nodes will still accept it as valid and so rational miners -ignoring if the tacit soft-fork has been suddenly dropped- would better mine on top of it. This because a hard-fork is potentially catastrophic and the most recent non-tacit, explicit set of rules is then a Schelling point.

While far from ideal, the OneBigHub scenario could be quite benign. The system is permissionless and so able to set up and transition to a new OneBigHub quickly.

Right. Not really "locked" if they are instead in a less-friction transfer network like LN. What I meant is that they are unavailable for cold storage, which is something that big hodlers often desire. 
You are probably thinking in "crypto-bank" companies like BitGo which will come with their ultra-secure HSMs and offer big-capacity channels to everybody. This is certainly a possibility in the near term, as a bootstrap for a more mature LN. However, in the long term, these companies will be able to charge much much less than their current 0.1% (and if they try, they will get circumvented) so they will end up out of business rather quickly. Notice that the current BitGo network is a walled garden under their control, but the LN is fully permissionless, so any attempts at extracting rent will fail (the Tragedy of the Commons).

A stealing chain is worthless and miners will not mine in it; if anything, that would have helped kill the legacy chain faster (it was already sentenced anyway, as legacy subchain would have had no wipe-out protection against UASF subchain).

And then had those "free bitcoins" and their block rewards wiped out by the UASF subchain, as it would have grown longer.


This is exactly what I meant in my previous reply. You are confusing *social consensus* with this:  Changing the ruleset is exclusively about the former and has nothing to do with the latter.


But it does not. Proof of work has nothing to do with block-validity rules.


Which is *social consensus* and proof of work has nothing to do with it.
Proof of work is a mechanism for agreeing on which block is the tip of all the **valid** blocks that stem from the genesis block (this is, the block-tree). It does not intervene on the definition of the validity ruleset. At all.
You think that *maybe* you could define a meta-rule in which you would consider only header chains (to evaluate cumulative work) and then accept as valid whatever block is contained in it. Unfortunately, that is not incentive compatible, so this is why it is not used in Bitcoin (not only centralization; the main problem is that it pretty much guarantees an unlimited inflation).

What is your point?
That 5-channel thing was an example. If you have 3, you dilute by 3 at a time, which still dilutes quickly as you go deeper in the network, so the result is still the same: The central part of the network does not need any hubs at all.
And what is your issue with the amount? Obviously, you cannot pay $10k if the sum of your channels is not worth $10k. This is exactly the same as today, for which you can only spend $10k in Bitcoin if you *have* $10k i.e., if the sum of your UTXOs is at least $10k. So this is, again, completely unrelated with the presence or absence of hubs.

While strategies can be very complex, you can view trades simplifiedly: Every trade has only two directions, buy and sell, and thus outcomes can be: successful, if you bought and keeps raising / sold and keeps falling afterwards, or unsuccessful otherwise.
An ample majority of trades are by a selected group (with us stonks, the top 2% of the most active agents account for as many as 73% of the trades). These top traders do more than half the trades, ergo they often trade between each other. When this happens, they take opposite directions, and obviously not both can be right at the same time, as "self fulfilling" would imply.
Now, consider that at least some of the "dumb traders" would be successful too from time to time. Therefore, the "most popular self-fulfilling strategy" cannot be really that popular at all or have enough support to actually be self fulfilling. It seems much more likely that it is instead by gullible numerologist and rationalization-demanding degener8 gamblers.

I doubt *Economic Majority* has the importance that you are implying. E.g., the *Economic Majority* would self-interestedly support seizing the funds held by the *Economic Minority* and proportionally share the loot, but IMO that would stop being Bitcoin in the eyes of most. Similarly, a significant enough minority could try to UASF-in a softfork for which they feel strongly, in case the majority felt mostly indifferent to it.
So, yes, the economic majority plays a role, but does not suffice to define Bitcoin. Bitcoin requires more complex (and unfortunately ambiguous) definitions.

There is a single (centrally controlled) code repo that currently serves as reference, but in my view it is not really "official" (at least not with the usual load attributed to that word). Yes, any fork or alt-implementation has to be bug-compatible with it, if it wants to keep up with the distributed consensus. 
Nevertheless, if it ever got corrupted and/or released controversial chain-forking software, I would expect that we would fork the code, or maybe move the "reference" torch to an existing code fork (e.g., Knots).
Of course this does not imply any legitimacy at all for that **Btrash** joke, nor for the couple dozens of similar shitforks/airdrops.

There is nothing to standardize. Many wallets, exchanges and services let you already set "bits" or your unit of preference.

So I was going to reply with something like "but he could be honest at least". However, the truth is that I do not think that something like Bcash could have been done and defended any honestly. 
By design, cryptocurrency requires global consensus. Therefore, mutually incompatible forks degrade the value of the ecosystem. This has nothing to do with permissionlessness or competition. You can compete on technical merit by doing a side-chain or a meta-chain; you do not need a new, incompatible blockchain (unless you are trying to scam).

This is not true. Before September 2017, no version of Bitcoin would have handled blocks bigger than 1MB. In 2013, a 500kB block broke the blockchain. The early versions by Satoshi that did not have a block size limit were simply not safe: There was a message size limit of 32MB (i.e., for network communication), not a block validity rule, and those would have broken probably still much earlier than the 500kB 2013 block.


But notice the hypothetical. Garzik complained that that would be equivalent to "change the fundamental nature of bitcoins". Satoshi replies that it indeed could be changed, with a mandatory upgrade. Mandatory upgrades need unanimous consensus, otherwise they result in a split.
In fact, this is what happened with Segwit. After it got consensus, we went from the previous 1MB to the current 4MB limit. This will probably happen again, if necessary.


Security. In less than six years, the block subsidy would fall to 3.125 BTC (and it will be much sooner for Bcash, because of the difficulty adjustment). By then, even at times where fees are low, there needs to be enough fee to supplement the reward and keep the blockchain honest. If not, the incentive for reorganizing and double spending will be too much significant. Have a look at the BitUndo pool. 
But if you are against fees, and you still want security, there is the alternative of staying at 3.125 BCH forever, thus changing the 21M limit. Either this or formally keeping it but still have permanent inflation with some sort of demurrage. This was Mike Hearn's roadmap, at a time where he was still a holder.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:51:29
Almost, but not exactly: Ethereum has a specification, but it is still the software that matters. Last time that there was a consensus bug between Geth and Parity, everyone waited for Vitalik's ruling. He said that Parity's implementation was "closer to the specification" (both were incorrect *stricto sensu*) so it was decided that the blockchain reorganize around the Parity subchain. You can call this *proof of Vitalik*, and not really mockingly - it is their very consensus mechanism.
Bitcoin is different. In the BIP50 event, the blockchain reorganized around the shorter, older and buggier subchain. Even when less users were using it, and even when an automatic alert was displaying "please upgrade". Why? Because v8 nodes would still accept the v7 chain when it became longer. 
Hardfork-hostility, especially when it is due to a bug, but also when it is related to an "improvement" of disputed merit, is an essential element of Bitcoin. Because of this, Core cannot force a hardfork, whereas "official" clients usually can, as it is the case in Bcash or in Monero.

We do have an issue, but it is not the one that you think. Segwit has been available for months, yet few transactions make use of it. This means, rather clearly, that they do not mind overpaying at all. Also, fee heterogeneity is surprisingly huge. Each block, a significant number of transactions pay ten times what would be necessary even for urgent confirmation. Again, tools like RBF and CPFP that have been available for ages see little use in practice.
The issue is that blocks are full with spam. This is, transactions done by money-burning bots, not regular users like you and me. Compare this:  with this:  As much as **55% of blocks are full with spam transactions**. 
Notice that there are very few legitimate uses for long chains. Most of the time you can do coinjoin, transaction cut-through or simply sendtomany. I guess that a vast majority of those long chains are by legacy centralized tumblers, which are not private (honeypots) and have been made obsolete by Joinmarket, Shufflepuff and Hiddenwallet. And what is not tumblers is Shapeshift, which externalizes its trading to the blockchain, thus free riding on the validation of full nodes.

Yeah, it is "locked" in the sense that its value can move freely across the network, paying any other LN node, for ~0 fee i.e., frictionless. Also, the channel can be renewed automatically, 0 fee, and would only close in case of no-cooperation, in which case nobody wins, so everyone will try to keep their channels open for as long as possible.
Soon, I am quite certain that we will refer as *locked* to those outputs that are NOT in channels.

"Fork" is wrong. A fork can be a *software repository fork*, which is a change in the software or, more specifically, a change in the rules of the blockchain. From these, a *soft fork* is one that is backwards compatible, while a *hard fork* is a mandatory upgrade. If done properly, there is no split.
What you describe is a *consensus split* or a *schism*. As a *fork*, when it splits, it is a failed one (be it intentional or not).

Because it is trustless, and fully anonymous, you will need to put a small deposit in a multisig address, which is automatically returned after the trade. This implies that you need to already have some bitcoins to buy more bitcoins; this is the main obstacle.

Only in the sense that fees go proportionally to Bitcoin holders who have channels. Similarity stops here: There is no staking, no consensus mechanism, no block generation. It has the strong guarantees of proof-of-work on the L1, not the subjectivity inherent with proof-of-stake.
While there is some "rich gets richer" thing in this, I doubt that it will ever become significant. Channel creation is permissionless, and routing is ephemeral, so fees will go to practically zero (Tragedy of the Commons). Indeed, it is quite possible that routing that imbalances a channel will have a tiny positive fee, and tiny negative fee if it rebalances it, so global average fee around zero.

No. For every trade there is a different trader taking the opposite side. Both may be using TA. So there are at least two sets of TA (in reality, many) predicting opposite things, and only one of them can be correct. Therefore, they act empirically indistinguishable from random rolls.
Think about it: If it was so obvious, so "self fulfilling" that we now are about to moon, then anyone selling now would have to be an indisputable fool.

Cryptocurrency is a giant experiment and it indeed could die (blunterly, it **will** die some day, as nothing lasts forever in this world). However, I am fully convinced that, if Bitcoin dies, all altcoins die too; they are too similar and add too little (if anything). 
Now, consider that any new feature explored in alts that proves successful (and no, Turing completeness or "rich statefulness whatever that means" is not) could be incorporated to Bitcoin via soft-fork or sidechain. So Bitcoin can afford to consistently be late mover and still succeed.

Me too. Read again what I said: "You do not need to run a full node, but you need to be able to run a full node." The reasoning is that if it becomes too expensive to validate, few people would do it for free (i.e., those that do it for "free" would give you an API and mine your data; many people do that already). At some point, it becomes too expensive that most people would only validate the recent history and accept whatever dev-checkpoints and miners throw at them. Then anything can be forced in, including demurrage for everyone and confiscation of ill-gotten funds. That centralization attack is not only theoretical; remember that the Bitcoin Foundation, when it was powerful, authored a serious proposal in that direction.

You do not know that; there is no way to know. But, if we are guessing, think that practically all of the heaviest transactors are batching their transactions these days, so that the weight of the change output is often smaller. Now, Bitcoin's gross volume is nearly twice that of Visa, so it is likely that its net volume (change discarded) is still more than that of Visa.

This is because "hardware wallet" has become a cultural identity object. They were shilled here already before they were actually safe (had actual internal screens). 
The reality is that hardware wallets are often quite secure by default and even somewhat idiot proof (at least to some extent). 
If you know well what you are doing, your setup looks reasonable enough, at least against non-targeted attacks (and for targeted ones, HW offer little protection anyway). 
Then, if you want something slightly better, buy a cheap Android device and use it with Bither, which makes some sort of poor's-man-HW. And if you want something significantly better, use multisig. E.g., the Glacier Protocol is quite idiot proof too, even if somewhat complex.

You can have it now. Open the console (in the Debug Window) and type:

You will get a segwit address (embedded in p2sh) and you will be able to spend from it. It is not as cool as the bech32 addresses, but it works and you benefit from the smaller fees.

It is hard to tell without knowing how all big exchanges work. From my experience, most seem to ask for 3 confirmations (30 minutes on average) for deposits. This is reasonably larger than typical reaction time (for wallet freeze at least). And big withdrawals need to be manually approved afterwards, most of the times. So I would say that yes, that most if not all of the big exchanges would react in time and avoid being affected.
Please notice that such attack would be different of the XVG/BTG ones. In those coins, it was the longer chain (the later one) that won. In Bcash, it would be the first one (shorter), as the other gets invalidated.

Please, read the sentence that you just quoted: You free ride on validators, who get nothing. They have to validate your trading engine, even if those are transactions that mainly pay a trading fee only to you. You are quite piggy backing on the Bitcoin blockchain; think about it, would BTC be any valuable if yours was its only use? No, BTC is valuable from its use as money: A-&gt;B transactional transfers of value.
So you pay the necessary fees to miners. Fine. Bitcoin is permissionless after all. But please stop complaining about the capacity when your parasitic use case gets priced out. **I do not want to increase my full node costs just to make you richer.**
Erik, it is thanks to Bitcoin -and not Bitmain- that you are a crypto-billionaire today. I am shocked that you give $1M monthly to Jihan and give back nothing to Core development, sidechain development or Lightning Network development. Even when LN could quite clearly IMHO reduce that fee.
@_date: 2018-09-03 11:14:27
Surprisingly enough, pools have become reputation-based more than profit-based. A lot of pools do not even share the fee revenue with hashers. I believe that, at current prices, and with current preconsensus techniques, the marginal differential cost of propagation (per vB) is sub-satoshi. So, rationally, they should be including these.
But they do not. I think that, more than cartel (cartels are unenforceable in Bitcoin mining), it is just that they are too small to make them care, or maybe that they are too afraid of touching the default settings. I think that sub-satoshi feerates are not typically included for a similar reason as why we do not often see block-withholding attacks (when it would be profitable) or selfish mining.

Thin clients are not trustless. If you do not validate your blocks, you are not using Bitcoin, you are instead letting someone else use it on your behalf. It is free riding and, as with all the cases of free riding, it works, but only as long as there are not many free riders. 
E.g., if nodes can only run on beefy workstations, they become very easily regulatory-capturable.

Bitcoin may well not be good for the economy, or the *current economy* at least. So what? It is deflationary and quite unstoppable. It is here to stay. The question is, when hyperbitcoinization happens, in which side do you want to be?

I bought my first coins in 2012, a time when buttcoiners looked reasonable and bitcoiners fanatics. Roles have been reversed since some time ago. Bitcoin is mainstream now, attracting attention from big media, big institutional investors, big money guys. They talk about it in Davos and in Bilderberg. Krugman writes about it. Buffet envies it. Obama, Trump fear it. That degree of attention was simply unimaginable a few years ago, but it is here to stay now. It has been ten years now; it is not a passing fad.


It is volatile, but its yield is even higher. It clearly breaks the efficient frontier of traditional assets (all while being little correlated with them). Bitcoin is the best asset around in risk-reward terms.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:20:56
In Bitcoin, the fee is not an explicit part of transactions. You specify the set of inputs that you want to spend, then the new outputs that you want to create (which include those that go to the payee(s) and those that go back to you as change) and then the fee is the difference between these. This implies that, if you wanted to guarantee that the replacement transaction had the same outputs as the replaced one, you would need to add at least one new input and one new output. For small transactions, this can as much as double their size, which is undesirable in the fee bidding process. And then again, miners will rationally do whatever is more profitable, as you mention.
Anyway, wallets know which of the outputs is the recipient's and which is the change. When wallets bump up the fee, they will always respect the recipient's output and subtract the new fee difference from the change. They will not let you double spend.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:18:00

Quite surprisingly, there is no formal guarantee that different releases are bug-compatible with each other, in fact, not even that any single release will achieve consensus and be compatible with itself. For what we know, each new release could well be a new *altcoin* (but notice that this has nothing to do with XT/Classic/BU/Cash, which are *intentionally* incompatible).
Bcoin and btcd have a very small risk in case they would encounter a consensus bug. However, I see no problem with Knots, which should be as good as Core.
I do not trust Core devs; very differently, I trust the open peer-review process they get subject to.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:22:30


Probably. However, we have still not seen any proposal that achieves consensus. Hardforks require nearly unanimous consensus (they result in a split, if not).


So, let me see. Bitmain is enforcing a huge monopoly. Coinbase (which is one of the heaviest users of block space) refuses to roll out Segwit, batch transactions or even keep internally transactions that go from Coinbase to Coinbase. Over 55% of the blockspace [is full with legacy honeypot tumbling](

I just downloaded that wallet to check it myself. It is indeed extremely confusing, but no, no funds could have been lost. It uses exactly the same addresses for Bitcoin and for Bcash, automatically (so not even need to export/import private keys).
The problem is that it is set to Bcash by default, even if the home screen says "Bitcoin". BCH is confusingly called "Bitcoin Cash" and Bitcoin is called "Bitcoin Core" (which is a node software, not a coin). The receive tab shows Bcash exclusively and it is not evident at all how to set it to Bitcoin. You need to click on a small arrow in the corner, unfold a menu, and then select the "BTC" option. Restart, and it is automatically set to the default BCH again; it makes it really hard to use it with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:24:07
No, Bitcoin does not have a tx/s limit.
@_date: 2018-09-17 10:18:42
Yes, you **could** make that, but the question is how often that happens. I also could do a $1 Visa purchase and ask for $49 cashback making it look like a $50 transaction.
In the end, the reality is that the bigger transactors (Conbase, Shapeshit, Finex) are all of them batching and optimizing output sizes. This evidence suggests that, typically, change output is the smaller one, and consistently less than half of the input (that is the objective of the output spending optimizations, after all). Notice also that transactioning did not slow down not even when transaction fees jumped over $10, which suggests that they were indeed being economically significant, not inane.
Therefore, I could agree that the $2.4T figure is inflated, but it would still seem plausible that the actual net figure is greater than Visa's $1.3T. 
And even with pessimistic assumptions, you could still say that Bitcoin's and Visa's transactional volume are of the same order of magnitude, which is a very remarkable statistic by itself.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:52:10

I am afraid that you might have misunderstood RBF. If 0 confirmations were safe, we would not need any mining at all. RBF is the only rational behavior, so miners that do it will outcompete and replace those that do not. If you want a robust, secure system, you would better enable RBF in the default settings (if not, private, potentially insecure patches will circulate in the wild for doing that -- see SPV mining as an example). Before RBF, we had a false sense of security (Ghash.io attacks) and things like the infamous BitUndo pool emerged, which is much worse than RBF.


"No issues" other than even more spam and even less full nodes, which are bad if you want a censorship resistant cryptocurrency. And fees would be most likely somewhat smaller, but not significantly smaller.

I totally agree with points 1. and 3. My main issue is with point 2., which I believe is financially valid (individualistically) but not societally valid. Use of energy can indeed be objectively evaluated in some aspects; you right about 1st law, but more can be said by evoking 2nd law. E.g., energy is often used to obtain *more* energy (net EROEI), it also can be used for construction, neutrally wasted (as in mining), or used for destruction.
So, in particular, notice that 12.5 BTC invariantly appear no matter how much or how little energy gets invested (wasted) in mining. Individually, that may well make a difference (risky investment, rent-less profit, which can still be very much profitable in many occasions). Collectively, it makes little difference (pre-2012 it could have been argued that it had a wealth-redistributive effect, as people reused video cards, but certainly no longer the case today). Mining is thus purely a handicap signaling; proof of waste, for coin entitlement. It has nothing to do with aluminum smelting, for which output does depend on spent energy.
I do believe that mining helps society find new efficiencies, as I have defended here:  Electricity is little transportable over space (transmission lines) or time (storage); it is often produced in remote areas where it ends up wasted anyway, and in that sense, using it for mining helps take collective advantage of that. Then, the individuals doing so, can use the proceeds of mining to buy energy in high-demand areas at high-demand times. But this does not mean that demand alone makes the cheap energy appear. If we want fusion power sooner, we better invest energy directly in helping it happen, not in pushing up electricity demand.

AFAIK, most countries that have clarified on the issue consider shitcoin trading as taxable events so, sadly, I do not think that you are that special :(
1-4 are also the case in France. There is an exemption for very-long-term hodling (5% per year starting from the third year), but if you trade regularly then it is taxed as active income, not capital gain. In that case, if amounts are smaller than 70k, you have the option of a being taxed for the entire sale value (not just the gain) after a 34% cut (micro BNC), or for the real gain without the cut.

Not true. 0 confirmations were never really safe, and in fact they were already very unsafe before RBF got merged. Are you really telling me that you would prefer private patches (like with SPV mining), double-spending attacks (like those by Ghash.io) and BitUndo? Also, if anything, RBF makes unconfirmed transactions actually safer: 


Empirically, it must certainly be, at least for those 400k that get **confirmed** every day and have no problem paying a certainly sizable fee for that.

Free riding on data abused on the Bitcoin blockchain without giving any value back is hardly considered as "a layer on Bitcoin". Moreover, they are shifting from omni to erc20 (as if that had any advantage for users; it is all just about locking funds with the master key). Shame.

It is a poor proxy. Until c2014 exchanges had a half life of a few months (similar to early email, or other internet services); freshmen were advised to withdraw asap to their own wallet. Today, most users hold coins on exchanges, bit-banks (Coinbase, Uphold), or even non-wallet regular-banking services (Square, Revolut, Robinhood). On the other hand, SatoshiDice concentrated, at its peak, a large majority of active addresses (all that with very fewf users); similarly for centralized coin tumblers.
@_date: 2018-09-21 12:09:30
for the initially reported issue, yes. But not the other. If I understand it correctly, a miner could have claimed duplicated outputs as fee reward. Even if no block with those had ever mined, version 0.14 contained an accidental hardfork, which only that last patch has softforked it back.
@_date: 2018-09-04 11:33:08
No, it is not oscillatory. Pullbacks are abrupt, which seems compatible with positively-correlated random walk, probably combined with stochastic volatility.
It is interesting to see that the ascents are actually steeper than the falls. This suggests abrupt surges in demand met with inelastic supply (i.e., a significant part of hodlers not selling at **any** price).

I do not buy that Zipf-law argument. It looks quite arbitrary TBH. I would guess that Facebook is greatly influenced by peer pressure, so that indeed, past some point, adding more and more strangers is marginally valuable for any given member. 
This is quite different for money. With Bitcoin, cost of adoption is relatively high (i.e., neither my employer nor my frequent payees use it, despite my eager promotion of it). It is reasonable to expect that, at least at the current stage of adoption, utility *for me* is linear with number of users, as is gets linearly more likely that they become payers and payees of mine. Thus total utility quadratic for everyone.

Unfortunately, no. Dogecoin is a clone of Bitcoin, with pretty much the same limitations. If it kept the fees lower (this depends on miners, principally) then it would suffer from centralization. 
The solution is necessarily off-chain. It can be tx cut-through, it can be aggregation, it can be LN or it can be Teechan (or similarly exotic solutions). 
@_date: 2018-09-24 09:08:50
I do not agree, no.  What does even "officially supported" mean? Supported by whom? Not only there is no formal guarantee that releases will be consensus compatible with each other; that does not exist either even for any single release, and indeed some edge cases might exist that make it lose consensus with itself. 
I disagree too that that was the worst bug since 2010. Old nodes would have noticed, people would have been alerted and reindexes would have prevented accepting inflation or, more generally, any accidental hardfork. While it is undeniably a major issue, I do not see it as severe as that of 2013, or even the BIP66 split.
I do agree about multiple implementations thing. When you need bug-by-bug compatibility, implementations only make it harder. All that for dubious gain, as the Ariane 4 accident evidenced (all three implemenations crashed at the same point).

It hardforked on *simple majority preference*, not consensus, and the unmodified chain had to change the name, because Ethereum's name is the property of a centrally owned, centrally managed "foundation".
That is what is all about. Bitcoin is what its users want it to be, while Ethereum is what its founders decide it to be. 
This is why POS is possible in Ethereum, because it is already centralized: As Vitalik says, the *nothing at stake* problem is irrelevant, because long-range finality is fully analogue to founders checkpointing as part of the validity rules. And this is also why POS is impossible in Bitcoin, because "dirty subjectivism" equals centralized management.
And, at that point, it makes zero sense that Ethereum wants to still keep the blockchain. It is totally pointless. They could substitute it with something that is intrinsically more efficient, like HoneybadgerBFT, or even Hashgraph or Avalanche.
@_date: 2018-09-26 09:27:36
Well, Bitmain's newer product does not exist yet either, so the comparison seems fair. Last week we thought that Bitmain had taken the lead again with their new miner; this new announcement suggests that that is not the case.

Yes. This is called the Tragedy of the Commons. The only mitigation consists in keeping the verification costs small: 
As a real world example, notice that it is no longer possible to set up a full node on Ethereum. All the full node guides that I have seen tell you to skip validation, and this is the only way in which you can reasonably do an initial block download, at least on regular hardware (and I have an 8-core i7 with 32GB RAM).
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:57:15
During the last month I have done 14 transactions. My total fee costs are still much smaller than my full node costs (you do not need to run a full node, but you need to be able to run a full node; this is what "be your own bank" implies).
Yes, we need (moderately) bigger blocks, I agree. Segwit already does that, gradually. And we would need more space on top of that, sooner than later. Something like a Mimblewimble extended block would be nice. The problem is that honest development (no ICO, no premine, no scammy fork) takes time.
I am confident that we will reach consensus for a block weight increase, before we can transition to something like LN. But if the climate makes that impossible, we will still have a failsafe in the Rootstock sidechain and things like Teechan; I am optimistic.

You *paraphrased*, not quoted Satoshi (and yes, I recognized that statement - I still find it condescending).
Also, you seem to imply that our knowledge of Bitcoin has not advanced a bit in 8 years. If that were true, Bitcoin would be either trivial or dead; fortunately, it is neither the one nor the other. 
And finally, please try to understand a bit better what was Satoshi writing about. In the whitepaper, thin clients are analyzed. Satoshi says that they require fraud proofs (we have never had them and they are probably impossible) and that even then their security was inferior to that of full nodes, to the point that he recommended that any habitual payee of Bitcoin would still prefer to run a full node.
By the way, and since you keep insisting, let me ask again, how do you resolve the cognitive dissonance between "only hashing nodes matter" and "Bcash (a minority chain) is Bitcoin"? Note: Bcash *thin clients* fall back to the Bitcoin blockchain, unless you use dirty unsafe tricks like in ElectronCash.

@_date: 2018-09-04 07:37:35
Directly, it should not. Still, it does in some subtle ways: 
- If it is margin trading (Finex, Kraken), it is actual trades on the underlying orderbook, done with borrowed funds that need to get paid back. If there has been a lot of BTC borrowing (shorting abundance, as we see now), people will need to buy back sooner than later, be it willingly or forcedly if price starts moving up (this is, short squeeze). Thus upward pressure, and avalanches when big liquidations occur.
- If it is futures contract (Mex), then there is in principle a full disconnect of prices, especially with the perpetual contract. Still, there is a funding rate calculated from the difference between the contract price and the underlying price, which tends to nudge one to the other. Underlying ends up affected too: In case of an over-abundance of short bets (contract lower than underlying), it is profitable to arbitrage by buying the contract and shorting on Finex, and collect the differential between *funding rate* of the contract and the BTC lending rate. So it reduces to the same effect as above.

Thanks for the link; I will have a closer look at LPPLS model. I am strongly unconvinced on that "generalized Metcalfe" thing, as there are fundamental reasons for exponent 2. As a size, they use address count, which they admit themselves has its limitations. Use of marketcap when total supply is deterministic looks questionable too.
I truly think there might well be fundamental reason for exponent 3 scaling on size and thus exponent 6 on price.

In the DAO fork, it became quite clear that he dictated what should be the consensus rules so that he would bailout his ass and that of his buddies. Similar thing happened when he got many of the opcode costs wrong and had to arbitrarily reprice all the incentives.
Vitalik presumes that he could fork the consensus ruleset in any arbitrary way. He is even redefining the entire issuance profile, even against previous promises. It is of course in that scenario, but only in it, where the subjectivity of "trust someone for old history" becomes quite equivalent to "trust devs for the ruleset in their mood".


They are not equivalent. The Ethereum policy is to hardfork by default and decision of change by majority. In Bitcoin, it is conservative by default and change only if there is rough consensus (and even then users decide with their nodes).

Likeliest candidate is your payer, isn't it?


No. Channels can start in unbalanced state.


False. You can route through "poor person" if she has more than one channel, and she can route through you her tiny micropayments (which save blockchain space). The poor will probably use LN less intensively, and do so through less channels, but it still beneficial.


It is not "locked" in any way, no. If you need to make use of that money, and you absolutely cannot wait, you can still close the channel and open a new one. But if you are in need to do that then it is arguably you who is the poor.


At least, as much as the on-chain base layer itself. Channels are just special types of on-chain transactions; if on-chain transacting is permissionless, then using LN is permissionless too by exactly the same definition.

That is shockingly good fit! It is effectively only two dof (as choice of BTC genesis looks quite canonical). I wonder what is the justification for that behaviour, though?
If you consider Metcalfe's law, it implies that network size has been consistently growing cubicly. That could be casual, or it could be that there is some fundamental forcing or limitation to t^3 growth.
Small detail: I presume "price" is in American dollars, right? I doubt that that is a stable enough reference over long periods such as in that case, though it is probably quite secondary here on a logscale. Do you have historical rates of risk-free yield to rectify price?
@_date: 2018-09-15 21:21:08
Yes, I totally disagree. Vitalik thinks that dev kabal with one or a handful of gatekeeper is what defines consensus (which explains why he pamping Bcash). It is not. It is all about having a public, open peer-review process and nearly unanimous rule changes.
So, no, "you need some trusted source to tell you what the consensus rules" is simply not true. You do not need to trust someone, just trust that the open process works, which is a categorically distinct thing.

@_date: 2018-09-13 07:38:34
The problem with that scheme is that it is fundamentally not incentive compatible. You can only hope to piggyback on the security of another blockchain, and pray that its value never falls below that of your use case (at which point it all falls apart as your layer becomes attackable from the base layer).
At that point, as Krawisz noticed, it is better to simply use the base token as value, and integrate it natively in your "dapp" (e.g., as a sidechain).


That is a gimmick that scammers have been using to extract huge amounts of money from investors. Blockchains are just inefficient databases.

@_date: 2018-09-13 10:24:34


Yet another buzzword. When you have ICOed the token (or insta-mined it - it does not matter), and you and your buddies run a handful of masternodes, the shit is not *decentralized* in any meaningful way, just an inefficiently deduplicated, inefficiently message-exchanged distributed computing system.


 
You are presuming that blocks are chained as a given, which is not a reasonable assumption, except in two cases: Either you are piggybacking in a base blockchain (meta chain), in which case you are only safe as long as your network is orders of magnitude less valuable than that of that base layer (in other words, your system remains largely inadopted) or, alternatively, you setup an oligarchy (the model followed by EOS and ETH with Casper) to enforce that indeed blocks get chained as designed, in which case the system is fundamentally inegalitarian and thus doomed. In any other case, there is no reason to presume that the tree of blocks that stem from genesis block will evolve as a linear chain.
Of course there is some value with digitally signed messages, and with Merkle-tree structured blocking and hash chaining. But all that kind of stuff is already widely used (e.g., this is how `git` works) without need of any token.

I am an econophysicist myself and I have been following Bitcoin for years, and especially price models -- I cannot follow everything that is written about that, of course, but AFAIR it is indeed the first time that I have seen that. Probably because power law is quite unexpected in that context, with time-from-genesis as the scale factor.
In particular, in financial time-series it is often translational-invariance that is searched (as a particular case of the cosmological principle), not scale-invariance directly on the time axis (thus with a privileged genesis).

In your example, first salary would open $1000 channel (he is poor) in unbalanced state. As days pass, poorman keeps spending his money (the poor typically spend most of their salary). By the end of the month, channel is depleted. Next salary arrives, filling it again. And so on.
His other 50 channels of 50p each do not play much role here, and are mostly superfluous.

Those are *deposits*. What *redeem* means is that you send the tokens to Tether (the company) and then they transfer you (electronic) USD to you bank account. It is something that apparently you can do for amounts larger than $50k or so (IIRC).


This is Bitfinexed FUD. Anyone can redeem tokens, in principle. It is just that they cannot guarantee redemption in all cases, e.g., if you are from embargoed area, or you are subject to international sanctions or some other regulation that prevents that. Ossama cannot cashout in many places already; there is no point with singling out Tether.


If anything, that could make you doubt about their BTC solvency, not their USD solvency.


So Puerto Rico is offshore now? They have never been an American company and I think that they do not allow or severely restrict Americans

1 ephemeral code is not enough, you are right. Simply take 5 of them and brute-force their combination.
It is 2^80 (not 2^61; the codes leak no information on the seed) but can be done locally.
It is still quite a lot for a typical (sub state sized) attacker, but definitely not beyond the realm of possibility. Easily affordable in the near future.

Ethereum premined most of the issuance; they only left a small part left to get mined later on. So, yes, it is actually very similar to Ripple.
They cannot solve "subjectivity" issue, because that is inherent to stake system (see again andytoshi's paper above). Similar with grinding issue (which presupposes uncensored access).

brainwallet.org got shut down because it is not safe (not implementation bug; the very concept of brain wallet is fundamentally flawed). I do not think that there is any reason to use it, even if it is just its library; please let it rest.
Now, BIP49 is based on BIP44 which is based on BIP43 (and uses itself the definitional scheme of BIP32). None of these define anything about *addresses*, as they are exclusively about private/public key derivations. Unfortunately this does not stop some developers from abusing the standard to encode address formats too. ^(and, as a side note, [they should never be used for anything other than hardware wallets](
A similar kind of abuse happened with the *wallet import format* of private keys, for which the version is sometimes abused to distinguish compressed and uncompressed public key serialization (which affects the addresses).
This is the issue that you find there. With all those abuses, Iancoleman uses BIP49 to determine P2WPKH-P2SH output scripts (addresses). Brainwallet uses P2PKH output scripts (thus addresses) in compressed or uncompressed form. And to make things even further confusing, Iancoleman shows a corresponding WIF.

I would not. Once you decouple block building from hashing, then the guy in Tokyo has nothing at stake (pools take 0% commission these days). Therefore, a small bribe or coercion can make him attack the network.

While there is no "from address" concept in general, there can exist some outputs associated to the same address (i.e., they were "sent to" a same address).
Then, when you spend them, you would be signing with the same public key; you could instead combine the signatures. 
This would add complexity and encourage address reuse though. It is probably not worth it.
@_date: 2018-09-13 07:38:37
The problem with that scheme is that it is fundamentally not incentive compatible. You can only hope to piggyback on the security of another blockchain, and pray that its value never falls below that of your use case (at which point it all falls apart as your layer becomes attackable from the base layer).
At that point, as Krawisz noticed, it is better to simply use the base token as value, and integrate it natively in your "dapp" (e.g., as a sidechain).


That is a gimmick that scammers have been using to extract huge amounts of money from investors. Blockchains are just inefficient databases.
@_date: 2015-12-07 11:31:34
IMHO Bitcoin can perfectly thrive for decades without any *complex structural change*. Sidechains and extended blocks can modify pretty much anything without altering the base framework and its security.
Notice that [Bitcoin has never hardforked (depending on how you consider the undefined behavior of BDB)]( This implies that *every release ever* of the reference implementation is capable of validating the blockchain today. Decentralization in something as sensitive as money probably requires this.

Block height is a set of blocks in a block tree from the genesis block. There is an economic incentive, but nothing stronger than that, to extend the block-tree at the tip, thus forming a block-chain. 
This is why "blockchain technology" without the "coin" does not make any sense at all. In those cases, they cannot maintain consensus and are hence not immutable.
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:07:23


Could be, but I do not think so. Implementing multisig in wallets, in particular, implies new addresses, new logic, new security model and new functionality (partial signing, tx save/load). Look at electrum: it constitutes a big chunk of the codebase, even after most of the functionality is actually externalized to plugins.


Fair point. Yet most retail transactions are of high priority; they are a rather small percentage of today's load and it would probably take long before they alone would fill 1 MB blocks.
We could actually have both, after all: lightning and Adam's extended blocks. This way, lightning could use the extended blocks, taking all these IoT micropayments and fresh Bitcoin-bank-settlement adoption. And leaving the whole 1MB to the legacy infrastructure.

This does not make sense. Erik is mixing totally different types of risk here. Once you know that you hold bitcoins with enough confirmations, there is little risk for it. Externally to the system, yes, you could leak the private keys and you are exposed to volatility fluctuations of the exchange rate, but internally there is little risk to lose them (long range reorganizations, bugs, etc.).
On the other hand, the reliability of zero-conf can change at any time: Miners are incentivized to always take the higher fees; they do not do it now because of altruism and because fees are still quite irrelevant compared to the block subsidy. We cannot expect this to last. Importantly, this is totally independent to the node behavior regarding the transaction sequences (opt-in RBF).

Fair precision.
Yes SPV means only that you do not validate the consensus rules other than the one of the longest chain.
So I punctuate my statement to mean that now, *in practice*, all SPV wallets (gradually) reveal which of your addresses go together.
After all, once you accept to download all the transactions, then maybe Bitcoin Core with headers first and massive pruning is preferable to all-transactions SPV: the extra cost of validating the blocks outweights the security benefit of verifying the consensus rules.

Mining is not just coin distribution but also securing the chain.

Many miners leave the default values for fees. Nevertheless, even if not truly a market, fees have a very important role today in reducing spam.

@_date: 2018-09-26 08:33:51
Well, it is over eight years of practical experience, so it is certainly quite diverse. 
 - We now have theoretical proofs that fee market is necessary (Houy, Ren).
 - Fraud proofs necessary for "letting clients just be clients" have been unfeasible (for now at least).
 - We also know that, with the fee, the first-seen rule is not incentive compatible. BitUndo pool proved that in practice.
 - Experience shows that big pools will attack (GHash) or at least play damaging political games (Bitmain).
 - Also, attack scenarios can happen before 51% (as it was thought at first), because of Selfish Mining and Block Withholding.
 - BIP66 and UASF clearly evidenced in practice why having full node is more critical than anticipated.
 - Finally, node count has been seen *declining* even with increasing adoption. Satoshi did not anticipate on-chain non-coin abuse like lotteries or diamond registrations -- indeed he suggested a different chain for those (Namecoin)

Well, this goes in the line of Szabo's argument though: If they do not trust the VPS in Tokyo for the coinbase transaction, they should not trust him either for the rest of transactions (i.e., they could be building invalid blocks or, more subtly, attacking BetCoinDice or applying redlists).
Honestly, if the Great Firewall is such an obstacle and 60% of the hashing power is on the Chinese side, then it is the rest of the world -not China- who is in trouble.
In other words, it is you who should build a stratum bridge to a Chinese VPS inside the Firewall that talks directly to the Chinese majority of the hashing power.

First, birthday attacks are 2^(L/2) not 2^(L/3). But even then, they are irrelevant here. You do not want to generate collisions. The number of addresses that contain at least one satoshi is [around 2^(20)]( so you would typically need 2^(236) guesses instead of 2^(256) i.e., still impractical.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:13:21


I would argue the opposite: No limit was required in 2012-2013 as there were no transactions then (even when pools accepted 0-fee!); it was not until late 2015-2016 that it started functioning. A limit makes no sense (and has no practical effect) if it is not meant to be hit.
That said, I agree that it can be changed. This happened in September: The block size limit got removed, and instead we got a 4MB weight limit.


When devs can change the definition of a chain and force a split, this is an indicator that the coin is centralized. It is only because Vitalik legally owns the Ethereum brand that he took it with the forked chain, which is invalid by the previous rules.

Not that unlikely, no. If you read the Wizsec reports, it is quite far from "missing amounts correspond almost exactly". They do correspond roughly, but we are talking about 950k BTC, so a couple ten thousand could pretty well mismatch.
Other than that, consider that exactly 200k BTC being found happened under extremely strange and extremely suspicious circumstances: A couple weeks after Mark had confirmed that the entire cold wallet had leaked and fully emptied, he then claimed that some years-old, legacy-format, abandoned wallet containing 200k BTC had been previously forgotten, never transfered to the new wallet system and stayed away from hacking.
Sadly, most people seemed happy enough that at least something had been found and did not question how.

AFAIK discussing changes has always been on-topic (see, e.g., the articles with research on *proof of stake* every once in a while). Moderation bans only the promotion of alternative / incompatible chains. Notice also that sidechains and extended blocks permit nearly unlimited evolution without any need for hardforking changes.
Finally, *censorship* is a very inappropriate term to describe [moderation in a private forum]( Hypocritically, the main concern against XT is precisely that it increases the risk of financial censorship (e.g., the proposal of redlists).

You are right: the attacker eavesdrops the codes from the user (not the server). There are multiple ways to do this in non-interactive ways though.
The point of TOTP is that the codes are time-limited; they are more than just a second password. However, brute-forcing the seed opens the way for non-interactive attacks in which the attacker can access the victim's account unlimitedly.
More concretely: Let us say that the attacker is phishing a victim. The victim logs into Coinbase and the attacker steals her auth cookie. What can the attacker do? Not much: Withdrawals need an additional code. Now, if the attacker derives the seed, and so can generate codes, what can she do? Anything, at any time.

Companies have computers with files that are very important. Bad people on the internet do all sorts of naughty tricks to block those files from your access, and then ask for payment to have that access restored.

Keep in mind that SPV has significant security and privacy trade-offs.
Essentially, you are trusting that the longest chain is also correct (with respect to the consensus rules). Also, you are telling others which of your addresses go together (so that deanonymizing one reveals our whole stash and transaction history).

Remote requests are naturally limited to a few per second, and the code changes every 30 seconds. 19 bits is plenty in this setting.

We are not describing the same thing.
Let us say I have your username and password, but not your 2FA. I can query the server and it will show an ephemeral code associated to your account. Two options to own you:
 - I try to crack the ephemeral code. All codes are unrelated to each other; I need 2^19 tries in 30 seconds, and I can only know about their validity by posting them to the server. I could botnet to avoid IP based protections, but even then it is practically infeasible. Even more when TOTP systems limit the number of queries per second.

This is not scalability. Not only Monero transactions are huge, dynamic size limit means that the blockchain grows unpredictably, and Monero's ring signature design means that there is no way to know what is spent, so UTXOs grown exponentially.
You can keep transaction fees low and make validation costs explode, but this makes the network centralized and quite easily censurable.

There is no *reference implementation* in Bitcoin. The only reference is the protocol specification (and then there is an exemplar implementation in bitcoin-qt; one that is fairly optimized and documented, if you want).
Yes, that hard fork is highly contentious. It is because it fundamentally affects the protocol at a point where it is not broken (and this would be the case even if the effect on fee incentives and full-node decentralization is negligible).

Correct. It was v0.17 that introduced an accidental hardfork. The secretly deploy, v0.17.1 was a *softfork* for that. 
Still, small miners that got "ignored" and went on with v0.17 were at risk of getting their blocks invalidated and, anyway, they might have wasted hash cycles. Basically, if you are Bcash miner, you should mine at one of Jihan's pools.

The number of full nodes has been consistently declining over the last few years. A majority of *regular* users have shifted to light wallets (which do not verify the contents of the blockchain) or -God forbid- web wallets.
The result is that [the network has still probably enough nodes to operate safely]( but it has become weaker, less private and more vulnerable to attacks (e.g., block races leading to Finney attacks or selfish mining).
In consequence, the *devious plan* is increasing the number of full nodes to make Bitcoin stronger, even when the Tragedy of the Commons would be dragging us in the opposite direction.
@_date: 2018-08-28 11:27:44
Correct! The same is true for any other exchange, though. At least with Tether you have some transparency on a ceiling of how many fake-dollars have crafted Bitfinex. We have no way to know how much inflated are Coinbase's dollar balances.

Monero has many issues though. 
 - It uses novel crypto, which means that its privacy gets broken every now and then. 
 - It is fundamentally unescalable; this permanently condemns it to niche use.
 - Because of that, there are little chances for closed buy-sell-buy loops, which means that most trades begin with and end with an exchange, which can easily decloak (and will almost certainly be forced by regulators to do so).
 - Little use also implies easier timing and network analysis to uncover the transactors.
 - Even if blinded, transactions end up in a blockchain, for permanent inspection. This is why Bitcoin with LN could be potentially more private: Onion-routed LN-transactions are evident only to the payer and the payee, and not recorded anywhere.

No, elections have already a central organizer, so there is no point in distributing the transmission of messages (votes, in this case). Notice that blockchains are not magically immutable either.

When the private key is equal to 1, there is not calculation to do. The public key trivially coincides with the generator point, this is, `02 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815B 16F81798` in the standard compressed serialization.

While I agree that UASF does not need an (initial) miner majority, I think it does need at least some non-negligible minority support.
It is yet to be seen, in practice, what would happen and who would swerve first if (economically significant) nodes start rejecting blocks but no forked blocks come through.

*Coinbase* is the first transaction of every block in the blockchain.
"*Con*base" may be somewhat mocking, but an accurate one, as that thing is undoubtedly a *con* in many ways. Where did they go wrong? Practically everywhere: Fundamentally, they want to be a Bitcoin bank when the base proposition of Bitcoin is about being your own bank. 
Then, they fail very often and in multiple ways: When it booms, purchases "fail" and you have to buy again higher. When it crashes, they get "overloaded" and would not let you sell until lower. Use it for gambling or porn? Account disabled. Then they would do a terrible wallet implementation in which they duplicate every operation and outputs get smaller than what is spendable (a-k-a utxo spam).
But the worst is not those *technical* issues but the *political* ones. They have been repeatedly trying to do a corporatist takeover attempt on Bitcoin, so that it can be manipulated to whatever fits best their private-business interests. CEO even tried to push Reddit administrators so that they would remove this sub's mods and put in their place Conbase-aligned ones. They also pushed heavily for a controversial hardfork attempt that would change ownership of the software repositories to a consortium of the captains of industry; they called it "The New York Agreement" and it quite specifically left aside most of the recurrent contributors.

On-chain transactions are much better blinded in Monero. Unfortunately, because of that, Monero is fundamentally unescalable and thus condemned to being permanently a niche, which is what makes it vulnerable. 
Concretely: 
- The blinding mechanisms are based on cutting-edge crypto that is getting broken every now and then. Every few months Monero has some bug that compromises its privacy (this might get definitively solved in the future, but I do not think that we are already there yet).
- Blockchain is strong but network is risk. Reasonable guesses can be done from location and timing correlations. This is why Bitcoin is developing Dandelion.
- Because it is so small, there are no closed payment loops, which means that Monero payments begin and end in an exchange. They can thus be easily deanonymized there.
- Best way to avoid chain analysis is to avoid the blockchain altogether e.g., with onion-routed lightning payments.

Before we had the LN, we speculated if the topology would degenerate into hub-and-spoke; fortunately we have empirical data now and you can see it is scale free.
I do not buy the "channel depletion" argument either, as you seem to assume that most nodes will only have one role, as either exclusively spender or exclusively earner. It is likely that they have both roles simultaneously, and actually some exchanges will let you withdraw to LN directly. Channels get thus naturally balanced.

That is obscurantism.
After more than twenty years of trading experience, and a couple dozen publications on financial dynamics, I am quite confident that such "secrets" simply do not exist. Principally, because there is always someone else on the other side of the trade and, no, there is not enough of "dumb money" for that: 90% of the volume is created by less than 10% of powerful whales (who have access to top-notch algorithms and can buy access to privileged information earlier than the rest).

He might mean that there are still no formal proofs that link blocksize load with peer validation capacity. There are just estimates. Actually, formal proofs are hard to obtain, [even for the simplified block publication process](

Two ways, principally. First, each time you want to redeem USDT for actual USD, they charge a 1% fee (which presumably is more than the bank transfer costs). Second, their bank likely gives them some interest for the money deposited; Tether keeps that.
Also, accounting costs are externalized to the blockchain, so they do not have to support them and, ultimately, the role of USDT is quite ancillary to Bitfinex to the point that the two businesses are run together in parallel (however formally separated). The exchange is the core profit-generating business, and Tether is probably just a tool to help in that.

I am afraid that you are a few months late in the debate. Before the initial LN existed, I could have accepted your model, but now it is already there and we see that it is wrong: There are no hubs.
Nearly always, networks start centralized (hub and spoke) and become scale free as they grow. This one started already scale free, so it is highly unlikely that it degrades to hub and spoke in the future.

What if I told you that every buyer has a seller on the other side of the trade?
@_date: 2018-08-28 14:16:02
Proper exchanges have both USD and BTC balances. People bid and offer them on the order book, at their chosen prices, until these meet and execute the trade (this is, the exchange: seller gets the USD and buyer bets the BTC).
On Bitmex, there are only BTC balances. Nobody deposits or withdraws any USD there. In its book, traders buy and sell a "contract" in which they take a *long* or *short* position. Then, at a later date (and a later price), they close the position by doing the opposite action. Any gains or losses are accounted in BTC and added to or subtracted from the balance. This is what is called a *future contract*.
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:30:59
This is cool and all that, but I am afraid you are doing it wrong: This is constantly unbalancing the channels; we need the opposite direction too, this is, withdrawal of freshly bought bitcoins directly on Lightning.

In my humble view, they both got open-source wrong: Open-source is not only about letting people fix bugs for you, but also letting you modify the sources and run them.
FirefoxOS and Android devices are sold non-rooted and come with bootloader locks that prevent you form modifying their software. People are still able to do so only because the OS maintainers are careless enough to leave exploits unpatched.

You are right, and in fact I would say that **noforkers** are mostly non-devs, and that devs are open to eventual capacity increases.
They were right though that some pressure was needed, not to develop the LN, but just to make Conbase stop spamming, and make people modernize their wallets. Even then, there is still like 5% using uncompressed keys even today (let alone segwit), and people overpaying 1000 sat/B when 1 would be enough.

You would lose nothing anyway and yes, a rescan would fix it. In wallets (web or other) accounts are adresses so malleability is not a problem (you do not need to credit back the account if transaction fails).

Every market has two steps: offer making and offer taking. In Circle, the company will exclusively supply the offer making, and the customers will always act as offer takers. 
Circle exchanges users' funds between each other, i.e., the company will neutrally feed the btc and usd sides in a balanced way.
Therefore, even if they charge no exchanging fees, they can still profit from the bid/ask spread.

*Per se*, neither sidechains nor treechains have any particular *defferences* (or *deferences* ;). Unless you want to.
Seriously, both sidechains and treechains attempt to solve the scalability problem in Bitcoin (thousands of tx per sec. and over), albeit in rather *different* ways.
Essentially, sidechains evolve in parallel, while treechains form a tree hierarchy. Likely, the root chain of a treechain would be set as a sidechain itself, instead of the main Bitcoin chain, to avoid hardforking it.

On wealth distribution: Yes, it is probably highly unequal, but this has little to do with centralization. Also, it is quite unique that ten years after release there are still 1/5th of issuance left to be released, and that this will go on until the late 22nd century.
Please notice that "wallets" is an abstraction; the protocol only has unspent transaction outputs. Actual figures are probably not as extreme.
On mining: Mining centralization is [quite meaningless]( but anyway mining is actually quite decentralized: Cheap-electricity spots typically have a very limited capacity and are geographically diverse. Electricity transmits very badly (both across space and time). Also, ultimately, the laws of thermodynamics work against concentration of energy consumption.

Most exchanges have done it *once*. So doing it even once a month would already be something.


As far as I know, the exchange is already an independent party. Of course, if it is done by a fourth party who is preferably a professional auditor also, then it would be more difficult to get defrauded (but remember Enron). But in any of these cases, this point needs trusting a third party.

Even better than identical copies, use [M-of-N paper wallets]( In 2-of-3, for example, you always need to combine any 2 of the three to make transactions.

Transactions spread almost instantaneously, so they do not need to wait to see it on the network. Transactions are publicly confirmed in blocks that appear each 10 minutes on average.

Bitcoin supply is deterministically known: one block every ten minutes, fixed reward, reward halving every 210 000 blocks. Consequently, Bitcoin price (not necessarily value) is driven by demand, at least at the global, ecosystem level.
Notice that this does not imply that the supply curve at the exchange market is fixed; it is obviously not. Sell orders depend on speculative dynamics (bullish/bearish panics), selling pressure by miners depending on mining costs, saving/spending cycles, etc.
However, unlike most commodities, a **price increase cannot increase production**, or vice versa. This point is very specific of Bitcoin, and much different from central-banking fiat monetary policy or the case of gold/silver as money. In particular, it implies that prices of goods and services in BTC will remain fixed only in a stationary economy and then only once it reaches its ultimate level of adoption (in a digital era, this is not necessarily a problem).

Unlike fiat or gold, you transparently know the monetary base of bitcoin and its supply evolves deterministically.
Miners hold only when the exchange price is unattractive to them. Unlike gold, more or less mining does not change how many bitcoins enter the market per unit of time.
While prices in bitcoin could never be constant, the bitcoin-denominated GDP can provide the correct index that regularizes prices.
An example for the simplest case: a global, fully bitcoin economy with no more mining:
    BTC index-price of a product = (price-weighted) share of that product in the GDP * monetary base
Of course the free market determines the actual price of each product/service; this index just allows comparing bitcoin-denominated prices along time.
This way, deflation does not stop mines and does not incentivize hoarding either: if people spend less, then the economy shrinks and bitcoin is worth less; rational players would hence hoard on inflation and disburse on deflation. Also, without debt-based fractional-reserve cushions, this stabilizing feedback loop can be nearly realtime.
EDIT: I apologize for posting too quickly. The indexed-price formula above is too idealized because it ignores two factors: the fraction of bitcoins that actually circulate and their circulation velocity (how many transactions are they involved per year, on average). As with the GDP, these two factors can only be estimated (not transparently known) albeit much better than in the fiat case because of the public blockchain. Therefore, in a less toy-model setting, the above formula should be:
    BTC index-price of a product = (price-weighted) share of that product in the GDP * circulating fraction * circulation velocity * monetary base
@_date: 2014-08-04 11:19:11
About fees: With the recently unveiled *floating fees*, fees will be established in a more competitive way. Still, the network needs spam-prevention mechanisms. At its current scalability, Bitcoin might never be fit for micro-tx. In the future, tree chains could change this.
About the stuck transaction: To me, this is a bug in BitWallet. Most wallets I know do not permit you to create transactions that will never confirm, unless you manually craft them as raw transactions. I only experienced this in those cases (raw transactions); as others mentioned, no need to worry as the transaction will eventually be dropped in a few days.

That's fair!
Me, what I dislike about bitcoin: prices need continuous adjustment (by design: deterministic supply) as demand fluctuates -- fluctuations are unavoidable, even in a stationary economy. Ok, I can live with that.
Yet, the monetary base is not known, because of lost coins. It seems that we could have, for the first time in history, a direct knowledge of, not only how much money will ever be available, not only how much money becomes available over time, but also how much money is actually there in the economy.
But we do not. Uncertainty about Satoshi's stash, Goxcoin, etc. directly affects bitcoin valuation.
Automatic expiration of outputs has already been proposed several times. My opinion is that the benefit of knowing the monetary base of the economy outweighs the reduction in privacy (which should be enhanced instead through coinjoin and avoidance of address reuse).

Some elements of proof-of-work (laws of heat dissipation, limited capacity of cheap-energy spots) and more general Bitcoin mining (reward halving, reward maturity) work against centralization. However, the problem with 51% is that it is an absorbing state: even if reached as a fluctuation, a situation with one single miner/mining conglomerate is stable. 
With Bitmain, we may or may not already be in that situation.
The only defense users have against that majority miner abusing its position is the credible threat of a pow change. That needs a hardfork; one that, because of how brinkmanship works, it may never actually need to be executed, but only if it is credible enough that Bitcoin would indeed go through it with no significant split.

Maybe it is against intuition; let us do the math: house advantage 1% (sathoshidice) and an enormous 20x rollover is required: 0.99^20 = 0.82. The house loses 82% of the time.
Let us try roulette: house advantage is 1/37 and we still demand 20x rollover (btw, coinbet asked as little as 3x first, then said 10x, then 20x): 1/37^20 = 0.56. That is, on average, more than half of your customers get free money.
Try being solvent in those conditions.

I finished it!
Look at the new version of [the script]( It now outputs a 2-of-3 scheme where any two of the slides reveal the secret QR code when superposed, while any slide alone leaks no information about it.
The encoding shares are now in 3x3 blocks, with 33% occultation corresponding to white pixels, and 67% occultation corresponding to black ones. This implies a poorer contrast than for the 2-of-2 case. [See here an example]( with the simulated superpositions: despite the decreased contrast, the reconstructed QR scans well.
And, naturally, if we superpose the 3 slides we get an improved (33% vs. 100%) contrast.
Notice also that I increased the default error correction to level H (30% average). I am now confident that each slide leaks no information by itself, so this is not a problem at all ([when I did the first implementation]( I had not learned about the Naor &amp; Shamir's formalism yet, so I preferred being cautious); actually [Greg Maxwell has also confirmed this point](
Enjoy it!

Debt benefits the rich over the poor.
I am poor and I have no debt.
My parents have a debt (mortgage) that is around half of their wealth (the house + the expected repaying capacity). You could describe this as 2x leverage.
"Good banks" are over 10x leveraged in their debt vs. real-economy money. They also pay the least interest rates, to feed their self-issued financial assets that have no connection with reality. Bad banks are even more leveraged.
Inflation makes me poorer. My share on the global economy decreases, and simultaneously, that of the big fortunes/corporations/banks increases as QE turns their air-filled assets into real money.

Looks like a nice solution, both for storing and for transmitting to an airgapped computer.
That said, for the latter it might be better to use more optimized and error-correctable ways of carrying binary data on audio, such as [Frequency-shift keying](
Actually, I did some tests with `minimodem` that worked rather nicely. In the transmitter you would type:
    base64 &lt; FILE_TO_TRANSMIT| minimodem -8 --tx rtty
and in the receiver:
    minimodem -8 rtty | python -m base64 -d &gt; TRANSMITTED_FILE
where I needed the python command instead, because `base64 -d` kept waiting for the pipe to close.

Not with that scheme. ~~Slides are not symmetrical:~~ one is a one-time pad (i.e., a full-length random key) and the other is the QR code ciphered with it.
EDIT: My bad. Ciphertext and one-time pad are fully statistically equivalent. Also, the article I linked describes already a M-of-N generalization; it is just needs more complex *shares* than the 2x2 squares that I implemented. Thanks for correcting me.
You could split the black dots of the code into separate slides and then have M-of-N schemes. But notice that doing this leaks partial information, which is worsened by QR error correction. In a 2-of-N scheme and with level "L" error correction (7% on average), you would be reducing the complexity of your key from 256 to 110 bits. This level should still be fairly uncrackable for an attacker finding only one of the slides (just like in BIP-0038, for an attacker finding the encrypted key, if the password is strong enough), but it is extremely important that you understand this (I do not want in any way to promote unsafe practices; *brainwallets* come to my mind).
3-of-N or higher would be safer. Visually ciphered, BIP-0038-QR-encoded key should be ideal.
If you are really interested, I may try to implement it.

This is a bash script that encodes a text in QR form and then splits it into a random image (one-time pad)  and a ciphered, random-looking image.
When these images are print on transparent film and superposed, the random-looking patterns reveal lighter and darker squares that form the QR code.
The ciphered image is formed through a visual XOR (diagonal 2x2 squares) of the one-time pad and so it should not leak any information. QR error correction is set to the least possible level (7% on average) to avoid fancy attacks.
Please criticize it both security- and practicality-wise.
If there is an interest, I might improve it and maintain it for a while.

Coinbase would never do that. People sending from hosted wallets (e.g., Coinbase) do not control their private keys, even less the one of the service's hot wallet (the "sending" address in these cases). They would not be giving back the funds.
More fundamentally, there is not such thing as a *sending address* in Bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions mine new coins (when creating a new block, from fees and block reward; the proper *coinbase*) or spend *unspent transaction outputs*.
If spending these outputs needs their signatures, then the signatures reveal the corresponding public keys and so their "addresses" (hashed pub key).
There can be multiple such "sender's addresses" and you have absolutely no guarantee that they are owned by the same entity (e.g., if sent through CoinJoin).

In your secret chain, you are only excluding your selling transactions. From your first fork, the second time you buy the coins will most likely not involve the transaction you have excluded, so you add it to the secret chain and accumulate your stake. As your secret chain diverges, it becomes more difficult to find non-conflicting transactions but you could eventually find enough of them (mining is free) and perform the attack.
@_date: 2014-11-20 17:46:51
Sorry but this is very easily exploitable: the attacker just needs to generate an address with these same 4 letters (e.g., vanitygen).
Also, typical transactions have multiple outputs. Do you mean that the hardware checks the card code for the *payment* output and checks that it owns the *change* output before signing?

Yes, they are revealed to the destinator when spent. Or reveal with 50% probability if using coinjoin.
This is a privacy risk, especially if the destinator is not using a stealth address too. Example: I got coins at stealth address A which I forwarded to merchant's non-stealth address B; attacker wants to identify me so she blackmails B's owner (it is public) to unveil me (or me and my coinjoint partner). Therefore, perfect privacy requires then that everyone uses stealth addresses, and yet the destinator would always know who you are.
The only way to prevent the destinator from knowing you by default (revealing it only at will if required, e.g., for disputes) is using zero-knowledge proofs like blind signatures (zerocoin) or ring signatures (cryptonote).

Hardened keys fully defeat the advantage of master public keys. How am I supposed to use them?
- Normal "soft" HD wallet: I generate it in my offline system. I bring its deseeded version online. I can watch all the addresses and add new ones with the online system. The full public hierarchy is vulnerable (online), so additionally leaking a child private key reveals the full private hierarchy too.
- "Hardened" HD wallet: Adding new public keys/addresses requires the offline system every time. The master public key can reveal nothing, but it is also useless on its own.
So what is the advantage of the "hardened" case? Is not it equivalent to keeping the master public key offline, in practice?

I fully agree.
That is why I went back to Naor and Shamir's paper: after the N of N case, in the last section, they introduce the formalism for a M of N construction where M-1 leak no information (just like in SSSS). This is excellent news!
I overlooked it at first because they showed no concrete example, but now I figured out one for the 2-of-3 case: Take 1/3rd disjoint sections and either align them for "white" shares or shift them for "black" shares; then any combination of 2 transparencies reconstructs the secret, while each leaks nothing by itself.
This implementation is somewhat more complex that the one I described in my previous comment. However, I think that the fact that it does not leak any information makes it preferable over the latter.
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:00:37
Well, I did not claim that price exploded *due to* the halving. I may have expressed myself wrong; the second part of my comment wanted to make clear that price formation is an agent-agent process and so price changes are rarely globally explained.
Financial media are specialized in explaining all fluctuations after the fact: they always have a justification for any direction that the market takes.
Once you realize that every trade is done against another intelligent agent --which is on average wealthier than you-- it becomes silly to think that some information may *still be not priced in*. Or that you are trading against *dumb money* (even if you consider that 90% of the agents are *dumb*, this accounts for less that 15% of the volume).

That said, brain-wallets are a terrible idea (**but not a scam**), mainly because brains are generally poor sources of entropy.  This is an issue, and then also using *brainwallet.org* to sign transactions with a cryptographically insecure browser, like IE, could leak your keys (even when your seed passphrase is strong).
@_date: 2014-05-22 14:44:33
No, please, do not. Random-keyboard-typing is known to have low per-char entropy (or far from optimal at least).
So, the main problem is that you do not control how much entropy you are producing. You ignore when you have enough of it, unless you reach a point where it is evident that you have got enough (and consequently you are being extremely inefficient at that task then).

These are quite different points:
DuckDuckGo is about searching the web. Unlike google/yahoo/bing, they do not track which links in the search results you actually click. They can still track your search terms. Also, the pages you click can still track you.
At the browser level, Chrome will track you everywhere. RLZ cannot be disabled and tracks non-personal statistics (which actually become *personal* if you sign in to google); usage reports do the same but can be disabled. Chromium does not have any of these and it will not track you unless you login it to the google cloud backend.
If you do not want google to know which type of porn you like, use firefox or chromium (DuckDuckGo will still know it, to some extent).
Independently of that, the pages you visit will track you (IP, cookies, browser profile). Anonymity services can mask your IP to prevent this. You can use proxies or VPNs (the page does not see your IP; the service operator does, and it can log your activities) or tor, which is decentralized.
VPNs are faster than tor, but I would not use them for anything shady or illegal. The FBI allegedly found Ross Ulbricht when they subpoenaed his VPN, which revealed the internet café where he connected to the internet.
For regular-web browsing tor is the only option. Other anonymous systems like freenet or I2P connect to hidden services only, and they are not significantly  faster than tor either.
Last point, Tails routes all the traffic through the tor network, at the system level. This is a little bit different from the Tor bundle, which does it at the application level. This adds an extra layer but with a significant overhead. Whonix goes yet one step further by encapsulating the system in a virtual machine. 
The internets are full of discussion on this, but my personal take is that if you already use Ubuntu, the Tor bundle with javascript disabled should be more than enough. The Tor exploits we know exploited firefox's javascript on windows and enabled arbitrary code execution. Arbitrary code makes every system vulnerable; only the difficulty differs:
* bypassing the browser bundle: easy
* (Tails) privilege escalation: hard
* (Whonix) virtual-machine jailbreak: very hard

This might not be the best analogy. Bitcoin can still be mined (albeit at high difficulty); I actually got some from mining last year. You do not necessarily need to buy from someone else to get BTC.
XCP was fully premined after launch. If you did not offer proof-of-burns back then, now you can only buy them from someone else. This is a major difference.
And, in my opinion, this is not needed. You could perfectly allow continuous issuance (through proof of burn) and XCP would still have a value and serve its purpose.
You could even specify a rate that is decreasing in time if you want to incentivize early adoption.

What scale are you assuming? Today's internet routes just fine. Do you expect that there will be many more Lightning nodes than internet nodes?
Also, I fail to see your issue with centralization: Hypothetically, even if the ultimate LN is formed by a small-world-shaped AS network of 100k nodes (as in the current physical internet), and then the rest of the nodes are linked to these (with no overhead cost for multiplicity), even then, I see no space for neither censorship nor fee-milking.

Of course. Roll your own dice or flip your own coins. Expect them biased: repeat it multiple times and XOR the results. Once you have the key, keep it not only offline but also off-electronic-device.

Yes, you are supposed to safeguard the security of all your users and be as transparent as possible about it. You are not entitled to weaken it in any way (if your service is supposed to be reputable) based solely on suspicion of abuse.
Then, let us say that your community has 100k users. It is a healthy one, so abusers are not more than 10% of accounts. You need to hash every new password against 10k salts. The community is rather new and quickly growing, so the sign-ins/sign-ups ratio is around 1000 (I would guess that at bitcointalk, where nearly everyone has multiple accounts, it is even less than that *on average*).
Therefore, you would need to weaken your hashing capacity by a factor 10, only to prevent abusers' reuse. My estimates may largely err, but I believe it would be a significant factor in any case. Sincerely, I think that there are more effective and less costly ways of preventing abuse.

For this attack you need that 51% of the hashpower is corruptible (willing to take your bribe). This would not be the explicit collusion often stated in 51% attacks, but nonetheless an implicit one.
Miners are by default long on BTC. How reasonably could at least half of them suddenly go short and then attack? Or, more importantly, how would they know (without explicitly colluding) that they will have the required 51%? 
Rationality cannot be an argument here: rational miners will mine on the fork (with your extra reward) **only if they are properly hedged against the debacle that would follow**.

Actually, that could be done in a transparent way for the user.
If they internalize the bitcoin purchase, they could offer it at checkout, all in a single step: Credit card -&gt; bitcoin (in an internal Overstock wallet) -&gt; payment. Then, they could offer that option *by default* to all buyers, without even mentioning Bitcoin.
Now, considering that they transform back to fiat a 97% of the payment, the next natural step would be to simplify the process and do the bitcoin exchange only for that remaining 3%. Also, since the process would be transparent, they would aggregate this action for all the purchases.
After that, it would be no longer a *reinvestment* program but a more straightforward, bitcoin *investment* program.

I concede that my previous comment might show some paranoid declination. Nevertheless, this subreddit has a post about someone having her bitcoins stolen every week or so. Bitcoin wallets have become a major malware target. Yes, this is still a very small percentage of all users, but the risk is real.
The OP did not clarify it in the title first, but said later that the paper wallet has been a gift. This would be an appropriate use of online-offline paper wallets, especially for small amounts where convenience overweights risk. But not for security. If you plan to bring them online for using them, then do not bother with making paper wallets: better leave them online well-encrypted/2FA web. For large amounts, an airgapped setting is the only secure option. Or maybe a hardware wallet, once available, hopefully more user friendly.

Yes. Actually not even that: you can check the balances only with the *hash* of the public keys (or the redemption scripts), i.e., **the addresses**.

Well, these are actually two distinct things.
The IOUs are tokens that represent value, exactly like the case of colored coins. They can be backed (through a centralized exchange gateway) or just have value through mutual trust, like in a LETS system.
Apart from that, block signers synchronize through the [Consensus algorithm]( which is a semi-trusted model. It is not trustless and they do not attempt at solving the Byzantine Generals Problem: signers are fully public (to avoid Sybil attacks) and users assume that a majority of them will not collude.
In Bitcoin, with pooled mining, we also need to assume that e.g., ghash and discusFish will not collude (though PoW has a cost and so a double-spending is noticed from outside).

I know that they are not separate wallets but "regular" and "hardened" branches on the same hierarchy.
Vitalik's article underlines how the hierarchical aspect could be misleading: if the full public hierarchy is actually *public* (or just unsecured) then having multiple unhardened hierarchical generations offer no advantage security-wise.
For practical purposes, only hardened child keys offer generational shielding. Therefore, we should keep master public keys private (i.e., make no addresses) except for the last level.
Is there any advantage in having more than one unhardened generation (parent, child, grandchild)?
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:52:27
I think it does, at least in part.
The majority of studies on transaction fees evidence that rational miners should include transactions. However, not every miner acts rationally, and they could DoS the blockchain. Reward halving will eventually expel those dumb miners, but this might be too late.
Tree chains would avoid transaction scalability issue: we could add branches until each one is in charge of just a few transactions per block on average. This way, even if a significant fraction of miners do not include transactions, the system could operate normally.
Keep in mind, however, that tree chains are a fully different protocol. Bitcoin is unlikely to change that radically.

I do not know anything about Circle's internal exchange system, nor I am doing any unreasonable assumption: every exchange market necessarily needs both the maker and the taker elements at least.
Since you mentioned Coinbase, let us have a closer look at it. You say that they match users simultaneously buying/selling by pairs, and forward to another exchange if they cannot find them. I sincerely doubt they would do that: they would be feeding their competition, they would be exposing themselves to an external risk and, most importantly, they would be losing money (1% is already thin; if you subtract the transfer and exchange fees by bitStamp, there is no margin left).
Coinbase does not allow limit orders: customers are offered only market orders: i.e., a given price. They just announce a price and then users are free to take them (btc or fiat side) or not. Therefore, they cannot whimsically fix any arbitrary price, for if it is too high no one will buy and if too low no one will sell, halting as a service in either case. Instead, they fill their order book keeping it balanced (this means rising the price when customers buy and lowering when customers sell). 
Again, I have no precise knowledge of their internal workings, but I assume they work like that because customers can only put market orders (order-book eating, or market taking) so some counterpart (the company itself) has had to make the corresponding limit orders (order-book feeding, or market making). For all purposes, this is equivalent to the "matching buying/selling customers" you mention, but with a reason for the *price* they match at, and without necessarily having to wait for matching pairs.
My assumption is that they do not speculate with the price or do any fancy trading with their funds, other than plain, efficient market making, but I have not proof of this.
Coinbase earns money from the 1% exchange commission they charge AND form the bid/ask spread (around 0.2%) which you can notice in the price difference between  and  .
Circle, I assume, will work the same way as Coinbase, but without the exchange commission. They could still make money from the bid/ask spread.

On the other hand, they could publish every day the tree root of accounts' funds and a message signed with an intermediate wallet that contains no coins but which forwards all the transactions to the cold wallet (which stays permanently cold then).

Yes, but notice that that is also how Ponzi schemes operate: they "just work" and grow in popularity until some day they "stop working" and all reserves are gone.

There are 48 ways of aligning two square slides (4 orientations for each, and 3 senses: heads-heads, tails-tails, heads-tails). But 4 of the orientations reveal turned codes, which QR scanners read flawlessly, so this reduces it to 12 ways. Now, when both slides are flipped you get a mirrored QR code, which QR scanners do not read but anyone can recognize that it just needs flipping, so this leaves us with the "8 ways of superposing" I mentioned.


Yes, of course. It is in no way resistant to a causal finder of both slides. You are supposed to keep them separate.

That is a common misconception: no, you do not need to own 51% of the coins in order to do a 51%-stake attack. You just need to have had owned them at some point in time, because in your attack chain you would be able to revert all the transactions in which you sold them.
So, if you transact a lot (buy and sell) and at multiple exchanges (to avoid conflicting transaction histories), you could be able to reach a point in which you own 51% in you private chain, but have none in the chain of the exchanges (the "official" one), i.e., having *nothing at stake*.
Transparent forging does not avoid this problem: you can be punished in the public chain, but forge on your private chain.
The only proposal that could avoid this attack is that of *economic clustering*, but that means that trusted nodes are preferred over the longest-chain rule in case they disagree. In that situation, having a blockchain is pointless, because the ledger would be centralized anyway.

You are right: it is a terrible mistake to consider pools as independent entities (e.g., thinking we are safe as long as none reaches 51%). Attack alerts are possible with GBT mining, but you cannot be sure that the pool's miners would stop mining a malicious block (they may be *rational* but *lazy* in inspecting the block templates).
The solution to this problem is p2pool, which bypasses any delegation and makes the attacker actually require a 51% of power.
I cannot think of any similar solution for the delegated PoS case; in particular, delegates do not need any *stake* or to do any *work*, so pushing the attacking ones is essentially free (the only costs are having a reliable connection to avoid penalization by the honest clients, the delegate registration proof of burn, and maybe the transaction fees of the transactions pushing them, which are partially earned back once they mine).
@_date: 2014-04-25 08:37:00
100 delegates can be more decentralized than bitcoin mining, only if they are mutually independent, which you cannot know. 
Punitive measures work only when the attacker misbehaves. In the attach I propose, the attacker behaves honestly in the beginning and introduces her puppet delegates one by one (downvotes the weakest delegate and upvotes to push hers). Once the attacker has 51 delegates, the attack begins and the game is over: the 51 generate all the blocks, they do not validate the blocks by the honest 49 and they do not include any transactions downvoting them (since the downvoting transactions are not included in the longest chain, the 49 cannot honestly -i.e., respecting the protocol- ignore the 51, which remain as delegates; and regular users cannot undelegate them either).
EDIT: Larimer describes this attack in his post. He says it would require a hard fork and a new release banning the attackers, but would not kill the chain. I disagree: the attacker would simply change the identifiers and start over. You can only avoid the attack by distributing a list of "trusted" delegates that are preferentially upvoted, but then the system becomes equivalent to ripple.

Why that is not possible: Consider you have, from the original problem, slide s1 and slide s2 encoding a secret QR=s1.OR.s2. Each is maximum entropic (white noise), so the code is contained only in their mutual correlation. Since there are only two shares possible (the two 2x2 diagonals), there is only one possibility per correlational bit. Therefore, any slide s3 such that s1.OR.s3 and s2.OR.s3 reveal a certain percent of the secret, implies that s3 cannot be maximum entropic. If you want them to reveal an 83% of the QR, you need that s3 is only 17% random, meaning that it alone leaks enough information of the secret.


Yes. Once you generalize to, e.g., 3x3 squares, then you can have ternary correlations. This way yes, you can make a 2-of-3 scheme where any 2 slides reveal the secret, but each one individually is maximum entropic. Actually, I am implementing something like this now.
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:47:35
Yes BIP-38-encrypted keys offer an additional layer of protection. Their decryption requires many scrypt hashing rounds (properly, the actual key is your hashed password with the *encrypted key* as a salt). Therefore, even weak passwords are hard to bruteforce ([a typical computer can try just a few per second](
Making your BIP-38 key fully public might not be safe enough, now that there are scrypt ASICs, but it gives a protection against an opportunistic compromising of the key -- in case the password is not guessable, at least.

The main risk is that including transactions could become costly enough to be a [Tragedy of the Commons]( even if not including any transactions would damage bitcoin, no individual miner (or pool-op) is willing to include them.
However, cost estimates show that with the current transaction and fee volumes, including transactions is profitable and rational miners should be doing it.

No, this is not possible. A defining particularity of *visual cryptography* is that it works by occultation, and this implies that you cannot arbitrarily shift the one-time pad as you would in non-visual schemes, you cannot subtract. A simple counting shows it: in each of the original slides, the 2x2 blocks are 50% opaque and the correlation that shows the secret (at 50% occultation for white vs. 100% occultation for black) is thus unique. Therefore, any third slide that would reproduce the secret with the one would not do it with the other.
The result stays the same even if you relax the contrast condition (to just *lighter* vs. *darker* occultations), except for a trivial case: the one where the third slide is the secret itself.
All this implies that for doing the 2-of-3 case, we need to change the base pattern (the *shares*, in Naor &amp; Shamir's terms) to 3x3 squares, or the disjoint circular sectors you mention.

The only worrying point I read in the article is the possibility of the malignant drive posing as a simulated keyboard.

The maximum redundancy in standard QR codes is level "H", which gives on average a 30% redundancy.
If your secret is 256-bit long and the attacher has half of the code, then the search space would still have 89 bits left (notice that QR-encoding is necessarily a two-way function).
Today, 89 bits is secure enough in most practical cases. For level "L" error correction (7% on average) this would increase it to 110 bits.
Of course, the visually cryptographic encoding that I presented is safer as it leaks nothing (i.e., independently of error correction, the attacker has still to crack all the 256 bits). I am just saying that the poor-man's half-code solution may still be uncrackable enough in practice.

and that is why I said that they not even need to have *anything at stake*
A single delegate might never attempt manipulation alone. But the point is that an attacker can be pushing new delegates one by one, and once she has 50%, she can ban all transactions that do not vote for her (a benevolent monopoly), or later launch a double-spending attack.
With proof-of-work, the 50% attack is very visible (the attacker suddenly stops producing blocks on the main chain) and recoverable (if a pool has reached 50% at some point in time, they cannot attack unless they sustain the 50% of work). However, with proof-of-stake (delegated or not) once an attacker has once reached 50%, there is no recovery possible: they could reveal their attack at any point in the future.

That is a very clever strategy. Why does it work? For each bit: Let p be the probability of 0 and 1-p the probability of 1, the probability of 1st-roll XOR 2nd-roll being 1 is 2(p-p^2 ). This is a parabola around the *unloaded* case (p=0.5): the XOR operation flattens the bias (in relative terms), and the less loaded the die is the closer to 0.5 will be the result.
Even for heavily loaded dice, this parabola stays always below the 1-roll case straight line for the full range of p. Only for p&gt;0.75 or p&lt;0.25 the distance (straight, parabola) starts reducing. But even in this case, iterating the operation will make the result approach the fair state at a relatively increasing pace.

The problem with that is the same as with socialist central planning: theoretically it should work, but it is easily corruptible.
About loans, the problem is that any interest is usury because the number of coins is limited. However, it is precisely this fact what incentivizes loans over investments:
- In the current system, freshly minted money goes to governments and banks first, then to the corporations as loans and investments, finally to the people. Inflation hinders lending compared to investing; this gives an unfair advantage to the wealthy, who can live from their investments and maintain their properties over time.
- In a bitcoin economy, there is no fractional reserve or money as debt that benefits banks and governments. This means that the rich and the poor are equally fit to lend and invest.
Actually, inflation punishes the salaried workers the most, who see the prices rise long before their salaries do. Inflation does eat up debt, even if loans take it into account. However, the leverage of a mortgaged individual is much less than that of the big borrowers: governments, banks and other corporations.

It was a tor **exit node** that targeted blockchain.info and redirected users to a phishing http site (not the usual https, but this subtlety can easily go unnoticed; even some attackers are able to produce a fake https certificate).
The **.onion** site precisely prevents this issue, since it resides at an inner node and thus avoids exit nodes.
With this option, they now securely offer service to tor users, so they should in parallel block access to tor exit nodes. The attacker nodes would still be able to redirect unencrypted connections, but at least they would promote among their tor users the good habit of going through the .onion site instead.

I think I will take your bounty.
To be clear: This would be a 2-of-4 scheme on top of Naor and Shamir's. Decryption could be done by superposition with the one-time pad and any two of the ciphered sub-images: each party would then be trusted with one of these sub-images and a copy of the one-time pad.
Unfortunately, something like a SSSS (Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme) is impossible to implement the *visual way* (the ability to decrypt just with the laws of light occultation comes with a cost). Understand that **the set formed of the one-time pad and one of the sub-images does leak partial information about your secret:** 75% of it. You would add to this the least level of QR error correction (quality level "L"; 7% average). This is 206 bits for a 256-bit-long key.
Cracking those remaining 50 bits should be still hard enough in practice. Nevertheless, I would strongly suggest to use it on BIP-0038-password-protected keys only, to have an additional layer of security.

The attack becomes much more harder with this, but it would still possible.
In the most simple case, the malign extension would store the random background when it is set up.
If unavailable (e.g., extension installed later) the extension could infer the background after a few transactions and launch the attack once the overlay has been filtered out.
Much simpler, if the user reuses addresses, the extension could deviate a second transaction by showing the image from the first.
Or yet, capture the good image, alter the 2FA code to make it fail, trigger a reload and then, at the second attempt, alter the address but present the good image (it would not be that suspicious since codes randomly fail from time to time; we are accustomed to this).

Parasitic, dick pools already exist, e.g., bitUndo. The bitUndo pool currently distributes block-reward+tx-fees to miners , but I could imagine them sharing a part of the undoing fees too (i.e., giving miners block-reward+tx-fees+undo-fees, which would be unbeatable by any honest pool). Zero-confirmations down.
Now, let us suppose that EmptyPool appears. If the cost of including transactions surpasses their fees, then mining at EmptyPool would give miners smaller payments per block, but larger per Ghash. One by one, individual, "I'm small enough to have any influence" miners join EmptyPool. Then, when EmptyPool's size starts being a concern, there would be PSA warnings asking miners to leave, yet no individual would rationally want to do it first.
Short, today's 4 big pools might be honest, but they could eventually be replaced if dick or freerider alternatives offer a substantial incentive. Bitcoin to be successful requires that transaction fees are profitable.

No. But the dangers of a 51% attack could diminish.
A 51% attack is very visible. Independent miners could switch away from GHash pool if they feel it dangerous (potential destruction of trust in Bitcoin in case of long-range blockchain reorganizations). Even if GHash establishes a benevolent monopoly, independent miners could ascertain that GHash would rationally raise fees for mining contributors to arbitrarily large levels.
That is why I think that GHash's pool alone would not attack (if miners act uncoordinated, the tragedy of the commons could still make it succeed even when it is against the miners' self-interest though). If they also control the hardware, however, then they could more reasonably attack.

Mining-hardware manufacturers sell their miners at a loss too, because this way they can get the capital (for repaying loans and reinvesting) quicker than they would through mining themselves. (EDIT: To clarify, I mean that they renounce to a theoretical future profit in exchange of getting the funds immediately by selling.)
Mining-warehouse operators are in a similar position: by reselling mining rights (and their associated profits), they can thus reinvest quicklier, externalize part of the risk (e.g., exchange rate), and still get a sizeable share for themselves.
Therefore, honest cloud mining should be possible in theory, even with a small profit for its customers.

They are not comparable. These are services, as you say; the cost of switching between them is minimal and, in some circumstances, it may be advantageous that users use more than one simultaneously, without value dilution.
On *the cryptocurrency front*, however, "users" are actually stakeholders. If it was to replace Bitcoin, everyone but the very early adopters of an altcoin would have less in the new system. Because of this, they can be rationally expected to stay with Bitcoin and even actively fight the altcoin (in the sense that it is an attempt to inflate the 21M limit).
Also, "new features" cannot be switching force, because they can be incorporated (eventually) in Bitcoin if they are really proven safe and valuable. Sidechains can morph our bitcoins into literally anything, without any value dilution.

I do not. I compile. Not everyone has to, but many should be doing it.
If we were to trust whatever gets posted on bitcoincore.org, then we could avoid all that expensive mining and validation, and instead accept as valid whatever UTXO updates they would be publishing.
From your comments in this thread, I presume that you are OK with SPV security. This is fine; the system can still work with some people free riding on other's validation (be it of code or of blocks). It just needs that many users are able to independently validate.

I was misunderstood then. 
I do not feel any adverse particular feeling against alts, and indeed I find that some might make excellent testbeds.


What is, in essence, an ICO? It means that even the dev founders are so convinced that their coin is worth less than Bitcoin that they are willing to trade large quantities of it in exchange for bitcoins. 
It is the exact opposite of *putting their money where their mouth is*.


Bitcoin is the least centralized. There is really nobody in charge. Think how easy is to make incompatible changes (i.e., hardforks) in other chains, even against users' interests (e.g., asset freezability and compulsory KYC in Ripple), and how hard it is for Bitcoin. This evidences how much corruption resistant is Bitcoin.


Users would change the hashing algorithm in that case. Such possibility is enough to prevent corruption from happening in the first place.

Few. I have not inspected the libraries, the compiler nor the rest of the system either. And of course I have not verified the circuitry of the hardware.
I agree that there is some degree of trust in that process chain. And indeed this is not much different from the trust needed everyday for things like that the mains will output around 230V 50Hz, that potable water will come out of the water tap, that the elevator is properly built and maintained, etc.
This is however completely different from trusting a hash published in a website. I trust the source repositories and their review process. I verify maintainers' signatures and trust that they properly do their job (which is done fully transparently in the open); this is the same thing that I do with the packages installed in my system.


I fully agree. There is no solution though. We used to have blockchain checkpoints (which is something in line of your OP), but this puts unnecessary trust on the devs.
Bitcoin will die the day when an initial block download is no longer possible. We will always need many fully-verifying non-pruning nodes. But maybe we could have some improved SPV with fraud proofs, UTXO commitments and whole block validation.

Just because they are cool devices is not a good enough reason for recommending hardware wallets. 
Whoever gets access to that crypto*steel* can *steal* the coins.
Instead, I would recommend multisig. It is:
 - Safer. With a HW you must already verify the addresses with two independent devices and then check that that address matches the one shown in the small display of the HW (you should check all the chars; attackers trivially generate similar looking addresses under their control). With multisig, you verify and sign with two devices, so the HW is redundant.
 - Safer. You should still protect the backup seeds, but the attacker would need to steal two of them, so you do not need a bunker.
 - More forgiving. If you use 2-of-3 multisig, then even if you lose one of the shares (stolen, burnt, smashed) you are still safe.
Hardware wallets are convenient. In my view, they are good for daily use, for protecting &lt;5 BTC that you have in your regular online computer, from which you want to avoid the usual wallet stealing malware (though not a more specialized one that will mutate addresses). For bigger amounts, let alone for cold storage, they are inferior to multisig.

The vast majority of transactions today follow any of two formats: *pay to public-key hash* and *pay to script hash*. In these, instructions and signatures (witness) are "mixed together". This has the problem of malleability (attacker can alter the format of the signature in ways where it still is valid), and it also has a perverse incentive: If a user wants to minimize fees, she will create more and more tx outputs in her wallet as she transacts. This is bad for the network (size of the UTXO database which, at least for miners, needs to be fully in RAM or nearly in RAM).
Because of this, Segwit adds a discount factor for witnesses. The block size limit is removed and it gets substituted by a **block weight** limit, that weights witnesses at 0.25 byte-weight per byte. With this, users can make transactions that spend multiple inputs  without being penalized.

Bitcoin is not a software project. Bitcoin is a protocol.
The real discussion is not BU vs. Segwit, nor even BU vs. BitcoinCore. **It is Bitcoin (a protocol) vs. BU (a different, incompatible protocol).**
*Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin's competitors* has nothing to do with *Gnome vs. KDE* or *Tomboy vs. Gnote*.
There is a reason for which Bitcoin will never have automatic updates, and it has always updated via forwards-compatible changes. Each and every release ever made can still work today. You could run v0.10 if you wanted (you would probably need to up a bit the BDB lock limit, [or maybe not even]( and use a p2p network adapter, but it would validate the blockchain). That reason is **dev centralization**: The moment someone forces an update to the rest of the network, Bitcoin would have lost its decentralized appeal. 
If we needed a software project *in charge* of Bitcoin, we could just simply let the devs sign some checkpoints to make the blockchain go forward and avoid all the wasteful (in that case) mining.

BIP9 is just one of the possible signaling mechanisms. Any majority of miners can use alternative ones (be them decentralized or centralized) if they want.

In essence, it is a joke.
^(Alert: IANAC: I am not a cryptographer)
Hash functions are very complicate. Formal verification of cryptosystems is often impossible but under the assumption that the hash functions are flawless, that is, that for *n* bits inverting them requires 2^n and finding collisions is 2^(n/2). This is called a *random oracle model*.
The great-grandparent looked liked asking for formal verification of the cuckoo hash function (reading again, s/he was probably asking for something more specific than that, but it is quite unclear), so I made the joke that *cuckoo* is indeed safe under a *random oracle model*, i.e., assuming (instead of concluding) that it is safe.
Hash functions are a largely unsolved problem. This is why we first used the MD family, then SHA1 (unsafe), then SHA2 (maybe unsafe; that is why Bitcoin uses SHA2(SHA2()), then SHA3, and probably soon SHA4).

Proof of reserves is relevant *precisely* because vouchers are in rands. If they were bitcoin wallets, then simply checking the address would prove that bitcoins are there.
Proof of reserves has two steps: publish Merkle root (so that users know that their balances are accounted) and prove matching or higher reserves. This second step is easy for bitcoins and hard for fiat, but it can be done for both.
In your particular case, a statement by the exchange on Xoin's fiat balance may be enough: It shifts trust from Xoin to the exchange, which is an independent third party that does not have any apparent reason for defrauding Xoin's customers or, bribes aside, colluding with Xoin with that goal.

BU does not have an activation method as far as I am aware. It would be extremely foolish to activate it without an overwhelming economic supermajority behind it (which seems unlikely, independently of miners' games). 
Miners cannot win that brinkmanship, simply because they need to sell at least a big chunk of their produce, and they would not be able to sell their BU coins at any acceptable price (the absolutely best case scenario that I could imagine in case of a split would be that hodlers maintain 100% of the value divided as half in the Bitcoin chain and half in the BU chain; forking miners would only mine fresh BU-coins, which would be not only irrational but foolish at Biblical proportions). So, even if all the Chinese pools adopt BU, the most likely outcome would be that they would stay at 1MB.

[Yes, the richest 10% pay 70% of income taxes, but they have 75% of the wealth!]( This implies that middle classes are hurt the most and taxes become effectively regressive at some point (which is not only the ultra-rich; top 10% is millions of people).
It only gets worse for other taxes, as far as I am aware. E.g., VAT is also mostly drained from the poor, as they have the necessity to spend a bigger share of their income than the rich. Inflation is another hidden tax on the middle class, as it debases savings and it can only be actually avoided by means of high-yield financial products reserved for the wealthy elite.

My point was that `weruieurioiuioerwuweirwerweoweio` has much less entropy than `eb0aa2349b357759c0da9da7b2920` (~25 vs. 128 bits respectively). It is very easy to overestimate the entropy of random typing.

Do you think that `true_random_num XOR user_salt` might be just as safe and more convenient?
In case one of these inputs is biased, the result would still be fine; in case both are biased, then the attack vector would be computationally simpler (but anyway if that was the point you would instead run a high multiple of hash rounds).
That way, when printed either as hex or base64, the user could easily verify that the computation was fair.

Of course, you are never supposed to store it in your drive, but instead treat it as the seed itself. In my view, the advantage of the approach is that it is very low tech. After you generate a seed in an offline computer as part of your wallet setup, you can then pass it through this. You will need a bit more of typing/writing to do on your backup paper, but you will have the advantage that it can then be hidden in plain sight. Another nice aspect is that you do not need a computer to recover the seed.

Bitcoin can adopt any positive feature that proves valuable in alts. And through sidechains, it can do it in a permissionless way, avoiding any kind of "debate" or similar bullshit. Because of this, and because it has the largest network effect, Bitcoin can afford to consistently be the late mover and still win.
It is not like switching from one search engine to another, or form one social network to another. Bitcoin's stakeholders are personally heavily invested and they will defend it up to a fanatic level. For example, if I am 1 in a million in BTC, I would never accept a lesser stake in a proposed "successor" coin, and so as soon as most think like me, that other coin will never be able to overtake BTC's value.

Probably not "a huge red flag", but yes, the situation is far from ideal, and we definitely need more companies contributing to Core. Also, fully separate libconsensus from the full node implementation, more consensus-compatible independent nodes, more patchsets, and generally more full nodes.
Nevertheless, the situation used to be much worse. In the beginning, Satoshi pushed releases with little explanation and asked everyone to upgrade in the forum. There was a central alert key, and centralized checkpoints. Then everything went under the control of a corrupt Bitcoin Foundation run literally by criminals that managed Bitcoin through private meetings. Gavin opened up the development, but he retained the final say for a while.
Today, Blockstream is just a small part of the contribution to Bitcoin Core.

rBitcoin does not like discussion on alt-coins, for many reasons (some of them are a direct attack to Bitcoin, others -most of them actually- are plain scams with Ponzi-like pre-sales, and others might have some merit but they would hype-flood Bitcoin discussion), and so new posts (but not comments) about them are considered off-topic here.
People at rbtc proposed (multiple times, actually) an alt-coin, which they insist in still calling *Bitcoin*, just because it has the same genesis and 21M coin supply that Bitcoin, but not the other rules (like safety limits on the size of blocks or whether transactions need to get validated after some time). This has been, rather obviously, out-moderated here. More disingenuously, some of them started whining "OMG censorship!" because of that ([they do not seem to understand that "defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it's not literally illegal to express"]( which has led to tons of subreddit drama.

OP_RETURN pushes for uneconomical uses of the blockchain, which externalize their costs to the node operators.
However, fees stay small and without an actual market being developed (even with strong resistance to RBF or size limiting, which should be its base elements). And fees are the only way to stop such spam in a permissionless system. In consequence, some people will continue abusing the blockchain for uneconomical purposes (dice, diamond registrations, etc.) and at least OP_RETURN makes it possible in a prunable way.

Well, I thought that it was clear that I was just using a figure of speech; I exclusively speak for myself and I do not care what you do, unless when you try to force bigger blocks down *my* throat.
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:12:46
If they want to be economically irrational, they will soon get outcompeted; mining is permissionless.
We know that orphaning cots increase with block size, which includes the witness (pre-consensus reduces the factor, but it is still proportional; segwit removes the main quadratic term, but it is still superlinear). So the rational behavior is:
 - If blocks are consistently full (and so have rather homogeneous fees), miners would maximize the block weight and witness will get discounted.
 - If blocks are empty and fees fall to a point where they just cover relay costs, there will be no discount (but still fees will be so small that it would not matter).
On the other hand, I do not know where you see the "central planning" there. Nobody really plans anything centrally: Segwit is just a new signature type; miners will approve it if they want, and then users will be able to use it if they want. Bitcoin transactions are smart contracts written with a rather complex script and there is absolutely no dictation on how should signatures be (even some transactions do not have any signatures at all).
@_date: 2017-02-03 11:40:17
This. I doubt there is much demand for microtransactions today (*some* demand, maybe,  but not an economically significant one), because solutions like Teechan or non-Segwit Lightning could be deployed quite soon.

I am afraid that you might have misunderstood the grandparent's comment:


*for them*.
Bitcoin is not about voting and majorities. I know: The mechanism used for the safety of softforks (by signaling readiness and then applying it at big supermajority of it on past blocks) has misled some into thinking that there is some sort of election. There is not. Of course not by number of nodes, but nor by hashing power.
Every full node in the system decides what is valid from its perspective. Then, if there is a global agreement in what is the valid state, there can be exchange of value between peers. If not, then Bitcoin is useless.
If there is some party mandating an upgrade, even if it is a majority, then the system is not decentralized and we would better ditch mining and use instead blocks signed by that party.
On the other hand, it has been conjectured that Bitcoin needs that 51% of miners stay honest to be Byzantine fault tolerant. This is still not a *majority wins* thing: Formal proofs have been obtained only under a requirement of less than 34% of faults, and then only for the simplified "backbone" protocol. Also, the whitepaper describes a situation in which a monopolist (100% of the hashing power, which is an absorbing state of the system, guaranteed in finite time) would still be incentivized to stay honest (the main issue in that scenario is the regulatory capture risk).
@_date: 2017-02-14 19:02:03
A compromised computer can alter every Bitcoin address displayed in it. A hardware wallet does not help in that case (the display would show *the same* address, i.e., the wrong one). 
Therefore, you should always be double checking addresses with an independent second device. But at this point is much simpler and safer to use multisig between the two devices, and ditch the hardware wallet.
@_date: 2014-05-28 11:48:01
They should at least use it. However, Shamir recomposes the unique signing key, which can be stolen at the signing point. With multisig you can sign the incomplete transaction with multiple systems at multiple places, so hacking all of them becomes much harder.

To be extra safe, you would use the page offline from a linux liveDVD.
But the best part is that you can partially sign your transactions at different computers. Then, even if both are compromised, they would need to be so by the same attacker for her to steal the keys.
Also, the multisig address is formed of the three keys (or actually, the two-of-the-three-are-required script). But each key also defines a regular, single-sig address on its own. If you send a canary amount to that address, then you could know if a wavelet stealer has infected the computer holding it.

If you do not validate blocks, you are not using Bitcoin. You are letting someone else do it in your behalf. That counterparty can learn about all your transactions, deny you access, even double spend against you (costly: Finney attack) with non-existent coins. 
Even if everyone stays honest, and even if the network can support a certain share of non-validating-"light"-nodes, such system has a catastrophic failure mode at some point, if everyone tries to free ride an nearly nobody is left validating.

Probably. You are voicing your concern, and this is already something. You might probably also want to evaluate and express whether you are capable of and willing to upgrade your node or not.
My personal view (not really an advice) is that we will be fine no matter what. A hard fork is a [game of chicken]( A schism is the worst possible outcome, even worse than ending up on the less desirable chain (now, I know, people are not always rational; this is in part why we had ETHF/ETC split). So we will most probably be fine.
Bitcoin is fork resistant by design, also robust against most types of political attack.
Now, if lunacy ends up getting imposed (real facts: personal attacks in the source code, forced upgrades and a closed, secretive organization -even worse than the infamous Bitcoin Foundation- in charge), I will probably lose the interest in Bitcoin, but I would still be hodling.

What I think he means is that this cannot be a *let the market decide* situation.
Let us suppose that there is a 75%-25% split of the users between the BitcoinClassic and the (unupgraded)Bitcoin subchains and that both go on. By Metcalfe's law, even the supermajority of BitcoinClassic would have lost 41% of the value. Now imagine a dozen of competing, mutually incompatible subchains. Their UTXOs quickly diverge and soon they do not have any value (be it individually or even collectively).
Now, Cohen's argument goes on to say that if instead this deterrence effect forces everyone to follow (one of) the hardfork(s), "squeeze out the old fork to the point where it’s effectively dead", this would have proved that arbitrary modifications of the rules are possible, even if contentious ("unilaterally change what Bitcoin is").
You may not agree with his point, but it has some sense.


Do not break the standing rules, i.e., do not hardfork until there is an ample consensus.
The proposed sequence of: 
`SegWit -&gt; IBLT and weak blocks -&gt; blocksize limit increase -&gt; LN / treechains / others`
looks rather sensible to me. 
@_date: 2016-03-28 17:58:38
His arguments may be flawed, but he has a valid point though. Notice that he does not attack the subjective valued token but *colored coin* representations. If these refer to financial assets, then they can be essentially unlimited, and so the economical incentives that prevent 51% attacks could not be there.
The commenter is too much optimistic in her/his $100M estimate for the cost of the attack. Since more than 51% of the hashing power is available for hire (this is what stratum pooling means) one could probably do a 3-confirmation attack for as little as 200 BTC or less, and maybe before farm operators are able to react against.
At longer timescales (e.g., 24h) we are probably safe, but only if we take into account the community reaction with the possibility of hard-forking back to safety.
But there is always a trade-off. Million dollar valued transactions could be safe with many confirmations, but billion dollar ones could still be at risk. The problem is that colored coins decouple their value from the underlying BTC value.  In the end, the only safe measure is when the base token that pays the incentives, the BTC, is the main valuable in the transaction. Then when the system is safe for 21M BTC transactions, we can say that it is safe.

Once you assume that value is subjective, you get how Btcoin can work. It is irrelevant if money originated from the specialization of barter or if it came from debt and honor relationships.
Bitcoin does not really have a previously existing equivalent, only resemblances. It has some properties of scarce materials, some of money, some of cash, some of payment networks, some of settlement systems, etc., but it is not really any of these in the full sense.
We only foresee that if it ever gets regulatory captured or otherwise censored because of centralization, then it will become nearly worthless (i.e., it will lose most of its value). Liberty Reserve too worked until it did not.

It is just the other way around. Bitcoin is a currency defined by a set of rules, which are negatively enforced (*verified*), i.e., we check if restrictions were respected, not if an exact procedure was applied. This implies that some people can use the system while they move to a *more restrictive* set of the defining rules; in general, this cannot even be detected: That is a softfork.
A hardfork, on the contrary, means using a wider set of rules; things that were previously invalid become valid. This breaks everything in the current system. If everyone agrees with the change, the old system dies, i.e., *we collectively let Bitcoin die*. Afterwards, we go on with a new coin (new, incompatible set of rules), which we can still call Bitcoin, by virtue of definition, if it is useful to call it like that, but this does not change the fact that it is something different (this is what happened in 2013, when new levelDB nodes removed the issue of the BDB lock limit).

"Bitcoin wins the blockchain race" or there is no blockchain race in the end. All the alternative (public) blockchains are testnets. With things like sidechains, Bitcoin can evolve to practically anything and it can do it in a way that is permissionless and leaderless. And it will, even if it moves late, because it has the largest base of heavily invested stakeholders.
On the other hand, if Bitcoin fails as a store of value because a second blockchain overtakes it, then why prevents that one to be succeeded too or, in that situation, what would make blockchain tokens keep valuable?

It looks like a great idea.
It is important to understand its limitations, though, which are inherent because the leaker is anonymous. The main problem is that information is not uniformly distributed but highly concentrated, and this is particularly true with leaks. This limits the merits of the provably random chunk selection. In particular I see that:
- A dishonest player could craft a false leak from legitimate-looking chunks. She could even make multiple Sybil-style commitments (encrypted differently) of the same file, and then when the block-height is known only claim ownership of the less revealing one, so that the fake comes evident only after the full decryption.
- An owner of trade secrets could try to fish on their spying competitors. She could actually leak her own trade secrets, force competitors to burn bitcoins for these, then never reveal the secret.
- A potential leaker that is not interested in leaking but is quite certain that the information will eventually become public could harvest some free money by not spending the bitcoins until the information is leaked through other channels.

ETH: Mostly premined. Centralized around a Foundation. Unescalable (nodes need to fully repeat computations, not just verify their correctness). Mutable by the innovative mechanism Proof-of-Vitalik.
XRP: Bankcoin fully premined. Arbitrary freezability. Integrates all the KYC/AML bullshit. No privacy.
LTC: OK (but ASICs)
XMR: Little prunability, less private than initially thought (it is essentially CT + stealth addresses). Has its origins (Bitmonero) in the Cryptonote scam.
DASH: Proof-of-fakenode
ETC: Like ETH minus the Proof-of-Vitalik part.
MAID: Not incentive compatible.
XEM: Premined, centralized absurdity.

Bitcoin is a form of money and as such, a bitcoin wallet program can send payments from one computer to another. These payments are **signed** to show the world that they are authentic, and **signatures** have a unique *secret key* that prevents others from copying them.
The wallet program tells the computer how to do these signatures. Nowadays, wallets use a general code (**openSSL**) for this. The openSSL makes a lot of tasks (other than signing bitcoin transactions); in fact it is used almost everywhere on the internet. This is good and bad. It is good because it means that a lot of smart people are watching the code and making sure that its **signatures** cannot leak the *secret key*. But it is bad, because some specific risks and flaws get diluted among the huge set of features, and sometimes these specific features are very important for Bitcoin.
That is why and other Bitcoin developers are creating a new program that does these **signatures**, but only in the specific way used in Bitcoin. The tradeoff is that less smart people will be watching the code, but the good part is that concentrating on the Bitcoin specifics leaves less vulnerabilities (risks) of leaking the *secret key*, which is what we ultimately want.

In the end it is a public goods problem. As long as many people validate, it is safe to free ride on them.
If you are not a merchant, and especially if you already trust your payers (e.g., payments done by your employer, centralized exchange or "reputable" coin-custodial service), you do not gain much by being able to validate them.

Only new coins that enter the LN need on-chain transactions. New users can join the system and use it without having ever owned on-chain coins.
So billions of users can buy bitcoins at an exchange, send these to their LN-enabled wallet, freely spend/get paid, and they would only need to eventually hit the blockchain if they want to store them in a cold wallet (old fashioned Bitcoin address), which is something that can tolerate sizable fees and long confirmation times.

Today, the most common Bitcoin malware steals wallet files, because most people have their wallets in their computers. If many people start putting them in separate, hardened devices, then malware will simply evolve to mutate bitcoin addresses (this can be done as a simple rogue plugin, and unlike the wallet stealer it does not even need to phone home - works offline too).
The attacker could then steal only the payment amount, not the entire wallet, but this is hardly comforting.

Well, I guess we could require that nodes do some computationally expensive thing, like finding a nonce that, when combined with a challenge, would yield to a hash lower than some target. We could even chain these solutions, like making the hash be the challenge for the next solution, and dynamically adjust the target so that solutions are found at a certain rate (so that rewards can adapt to the number of participants).
Hey, we could even then add to each solution the Merkle root of an ordered list of commitments, which could be e.g., messages written in a certain script language. If those commitments described transfers of value, the chain of solutions would solve the double spending problem (like make only the first appearance of a spending valid, or maybe even make any further spending invalid as a solution) and each new solution would help secure all the previous spendings!

Not meaningfully. You cannot be certain of having made a valid payment unless you determine that the inputs that you provide are valid and are still unspent. And you cannot know this by yourself unless you run a full node.
With SPV you can delegate this operation to a third party with minimal trust, sure, but then you do not really *send coins peer to peer*. You do the trivial part, i.e., the signing, and the third party does the bulk of the work for you. Or, in other words, the third party *sends the coins for you* to other peers in a way where she cannot steal from you but she can censor you out or hide payments made to you.

Many would adopt the fork; some may not. That was my point.
How much user loss are you willing to compromise to gain a meager 1MB extra? For me, not 25% (Classic activation threshold), not even 10%. Even for just softforks -which do not exclude anyone from transacting and validating- it is required than the minority in hashing power is less than 5%.
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:02:33


1-conf is not supposed to be safe (for big amounts at least, e.g., considering Finney attakcs). 
Softforks can also trigger longer range reorganizations under *stupid* (not rational) SPV mining, but these are quite uncontrollable situations and so very difficult to exploit for double spendings (except for maybe opportunistic attacks).

Essentially, the defrauded payee can react and burn the (double spent) outputs to fees. With RFB, this transaction replaces both the initial payment and the double spending (and having the max fee, it cannot be replaced itself), and thus prevents the double spending.
Since the attacker has no way to get the funds back, she loses the incentive for trying to double spend. Therefore, accepting 0-conf is much *safer* than with the 1st-seen rule (the attacker can still do it for the lulz or try to simultaneously double-spend multiple merchants at once in a perfectly synchronized way).

Excuse me if my tone is harsh, but this is absurd. 
Firstly, not everyone here is personally invested (and I do not mean the buttcoiners and trolls). But even those who are may be interested in crashing the price if they are thinking in increasing their stake and they want to do so for cheaper.
Many here (myself included) are *hodler* fanatics who are not willing to sell ever, until hyperbitcoinization affords us a citadel on the dark side of the Moon. Price does not matter for these.
Ultimately, in an exchange market the buyer thinks that price will go up and the seller thinks that price will go down, and they both do this freely and reasonably. The spot price is the only fair price. In this sense, *no place is a good place to get investment advice*. Never think that you can be smarter than the majority, because the majority is wealth-weighted and wealth buys the best expertise and information.
I fully agree with the rest of your comment though: BTCUSD is highly volatile and nobody should invest more than she can afford to lose.

Please read BIP39. It describes how you can use a passphrase that produces the master key from the mnemonic. All passphrases are valid in the sense that they lead to valid master keys, so you can fund a *decoy* one with a small amount. It is far from ideal, but if your torturer does not have a clear idea about how much you have (e.g., she just happened to casually find your paper wallet) it should be enough.
BIP38 has two modes. One produces keys with the passphrase as a salt (concretely, a key derivation function) to arrive to the private key, but the other just AES-encrypts a pre-existing key. In this case, the one you exported.
Finally, you can use a HD wallet just once. It works just fine also in that case.

I did visit  I do not read Chinese, but I have seen they mention Bitshares without realizing that they refer to a fork of it.
Bitshares is **premined** in its most usual sense. If I want to get BTS today I have to buy them. This is not the case with BTC or others, where I can get them through mining (imho, bitcoin is valuable partly because of this). Half of BTS where directly sold by the devs at launch ("angel" shares =&gt; dev centralization) and half where created from the state at launch date of the "protoshares" (a bitcoin clone with nothing more than a different hash algo). So yes, it is premined by as much as 50%.

It is very clearly the case for ETH/ETC and LSK, which were ICOed. Even the founders are so confident that their new coins are worth much less than BTC that they are willing to sell them in huge amounts in exchange for BTC; they put their money in the exact opposite place of where their mouth is.
Then DASH is a bit less scammy, but it still was quite insta-mined, and new coins are distributed via proof of fakenode.

As long as it stays off-chain, fees would probably be tiny, because competition has a low barrier and nodes are already paid because of their blockchain validation (and for lightning, they can even use SPV validation).

Modern paper wallets are the seeds of HD wallets. Both BIP39 and Electrum support encryption and decoy wallets.

Looks like a great defense against opportunistic peeking.
For multisig wallets, an attacker would want to copy your private keys one at a time without leaving evidence.
In this case, she could break the case, copy the key and then put the paper back in a new one. You have the *serial numbers* as a protection here, and they are good but not perfect:
- Long serial numbers are difficult to remember. But you can instead print their [**ASCII randomart**]( as the one used in openssh key fingerprints. Actually, I have a script that does it for arbitrary data.
- A dedicated enough attacker would copy the number, construct a case with the same number, and come later to substitute it. Plastic is easy to copy; you need anti-counterfeit measures. Holograms maybe, or even make another transparent window that shows a banknote, so that you piggyback on the anti-counterfeit measures already present in these.

What do you mean with a high-level tone? Have you read from there: 
While he uses no formal proofs, the detail of his analysis is quite comparable to the one in Blockstream's sidechains proposal, if not deeper for the game theoretic part.
The conclusion is intuitively sound also: In the merge-mined-side-chain attack described by Todd, a 51% collude to share the loot, through some sort of signaling. However, commitments cannot be enforced, and actually individual (sub-majority) miners are incentivized to lie in that they intend to attack the sidechain to then eat that pie of the minority attackers (who went on, thinking they were in a majority). The fact that such lying can be profitable would prevent attacking in the first place. Therefore, the looting can only succeed once the stake considerations (devaluation caused by the attack) are taken into account, arriving to the resolution that *useful* sidechains cannot be attacked and -as a feature- *useless* sidechains will be attacked for everyone's benefit.

I do not think so. I admit that I have not done the precise math, but intuitively:
Let us say for simplicity that the fake is a redacted document and that the dishonest leaker wants to hide the fact that it is actually redacted. The spatial distribution of information is a power law (of exponent between 1 and 2 -- my guess) implying that, roughly, the most informative 5% of the document has 50% of the information. Furthermore, this 5% is *clustered* in space. Let us assume that consequently a 5% is redacted.
We now need to take into account the discretization due to the division in chunks. Let us assume 100 chunks. Redacted parts are more granular and closer to the continuous limit, but clustered, therefore there will be typically not more than 10 chunks containing redacted parts (the attacker could also play with document margins and redacted-block boundaries to further "optimize" this).
Now, if 25 chunks are uniformly random selected, there is ~5% probability of not hitting a fake one. This means that 20 parallel encryptions will suffice half of the time, or 100 parallel encryptions for a ~90% attack success rate. This looks certainly doable.

I mostly agree with you in these points, only that I think that the centralization risk is probably more fragile than you think.
I closely watched how it unfolded with Ripple; its rise and death. The system was supposed to be a web-of-trust-based consensus. Its creators insisted that that consensus was robust under some particular non-hierarchical trust graphs, and so it could be decentralized and censorship resistant. In practice, however, the whitepaper was never fully implemented and they used a weaker version of their consensus algorithm; the trust graph stayed permanently hierarchical, with the dev nodes at the apex. A fork of Ripple, Stellar, started with huge load and its network (actually, its leading nodes) hardforked. After this incident, for safety, both Stellar and Ripple got fully centralized, with a single leading node.
A few months later, FinCEN severely fined Ripple devs (for nearly a million USD) and forced KYC procedures for every user of the system and arbitrary freezability of assets.
Now, Bitcoin DMMS consensus is most probably much more robust than Ripple's, but we do not know the limit, and I think that no central planner, no matter how meritocratic, can know it. 2MB is probably fine today and maybe 10MB in a few years. But it is incredibly hard to know where is the limit for practical centralization and once we hit there is no way back.

Some smart contracts can be pretty advantageous. Imagine something like this: Let us define an abstract token of value; let us call it CTB. We can have smart contracts that spend a series of inputs summing a given amount of CTB and through this, give the right to generate outputs summing the same amount minus a fee. These outputs can be spent as inputs of subsequent smart contracts of the same type, but only once. The conditions for spending them can be specified as providing one or multiple digital signatures, verifying a time lock field or a sequence field in them, or others.
Once validated and included in a universal ledger, every peer in the network can validate the set of unspent outputs without trusting anyone. This serves as a trustless, permissionless form of value transferring in a way that many have defined CTB as *digital gold*.

SPV validation without fraud proofs is a terrible idea in any case. Nevertheless, waiting for many confirmations could in a way bridge the loss of security. 
In the Electrum model e.g., you would ask a semi-trusted validating peer and headers at random. Hiding a payment to you is then quite trivial, but faking one is relatively hard and costly.
Then you could wait for tens, 100 even, on-chain confirmations for the locking before you would start routing on-lightning transactions.

The block will be orphaned; 1 confirmation is not safe. Bitcoin nodes never assume that their peers are validating the blocks they relay either.

Hum. You are right, in a sense.
Nevertheless, Core is just a set of releases that happen to be usually chosen as a reference implementation. libbitcoin and btcd are probably fine too, especially if you do not mine. There is no *governance* in Bitcoin, but this is by design, so that there are no central points of failure.
Today it is a couple of former core devs with bankster backing, but one day it could be Core itself that attacks what should be a headless system without central points of failure.
I think it is urgent (though hard, I know) to fully independentize libconsensus. This will probably not shut up all the FUD about control by TBF, MIT, Blockstream, etc., but will probably reduce it and make it more evident.
Most changes are possible through opt-in soft-forks or by means of side-chains. In my view, Bitcoin should be able to improve, true, but only with extreme caution. Once it centralizes, gets regulatory captured or otherwise breaks, there is probably no going back.
And I am not saying that hard-forks should be impossible: They are the last line of defense against a miner cartel takeover.

What then? We raise the limit again? There is a point where the limit becomes truly too much for non-datacenter nodes.
Miners are greedy and they will not defend Bitcoin's fundamental properties if put in a Tragedy of the Commons.

How big are the bags that you are holding?


Bitcoin is not a secure cryptosystem. It requires economic incentives to stay in the safe regime. It can probably *support* some colored-coin value attached, but the coin in which you pay the transaction fees needs to stay orders of magnitude more valuable than the others. If it is not, then double spendings could become profitable in some cases.


I think that it is the opposite. Appcoins are mostly traded against bitcoins, which implies that they are somewhat extending Bitcoin's 21M supply. Honest devs would instead do a 2-way-pegged sidechain, which permits unrestricted new functionality while fully preserving Bitcoin's value, or 1-way-pegged, at least, like with Clams or Byteball.


This was before our nodes got attacked by empty-valued microtransactions, on-chain spam lotteries and diamond registrations.
Anyway, it is still fully *open*. Uncensurable (as long as normal people are able to validate). You just need to pay the fee, and please do not whine "OMG my freeriding that externalizes its costs to the validators of the most secure blockchain is not possible anymore. We need to switch to huge blocks immediately so that my piggybacking can go on (and of course I will not be supporting any of that cost)".

There exists no *individual* incentive to accept zero-fee transactions. The *tragedy of the commons* would thus lead *a priori* to fees of 1 satoshi.
That said, fees could go lower, to arbitrarily small values, if paid out-of-band, directly to the mining pool. E.g., you login to your pool "users" account (in contrast to "workers") and indicate which 1000 of your zero-fee transactions they should include in exchange for 1 satoshi of your balance.

Miners can lie in their signaling, to trigger an early activation and thus kill the hardforking proposal (this is extremely simple to do: mine with Classic until activation then switch back to Core immediately after).
A network split would certainly damage Bitcoin's short-term value, even if it is beneficial in the long term. Given that most miners need to sell immediately a big chunk of their produce (mining is permissionless and so its Ricardian rent is close to zero), this implies that they are rationally incentivized to lie about Classic support and deactivate the hardfork risk.

It is also incoherent. I do not get how *we miners are conservative and so are scared of risky solutions* is followed by *therefore we propose a riskier hardfork instead of the proposed, safer softfork*.
Science is hard, and for every complex problem there is a solution that is simultaneously [clear, simple and wrong]( SegWit is the hard, complex and right solution here.
Chinese miners are extremely clever. Why would they state an opinion like that one?. My bet is that they are actually acting rationally: The current SegWit proposal is *incentive compatible* only when we consider it isolated, but it is not when we consider the transition non-SegWit =&gt; SegWit. This is because the witnesses pay only 0.25 times the fee they should. Block solvers still need to propagate the witnesses of the transactions, but they [get less in fees](
Of course, this is just local miner policy and not consensus. Miners could still refuse segwit transactions unless they pay the full fee per real kB (ignoring the *effective* 0.25 kB trick), but experience shows that few miners tune the standard policies further than the min fee parameter (e.g., we have seen that until not long ago, professional, industrial scale miners still included 0-fee transactions, even when these increased their orphaning risk without any compensation). Mines want to have a predictable inclusion policy that does not vary from one to another (fast relay protocols and IBLTs incentivize this) and hence **they prefer to have an extra 1MB of spam-sized fees over just 1MB of economically meaningful fees at a real propagation cost of 1.75MB**.
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:25:08
This is the case for a softfork, but not for a hardfork. In a hardfork, both subchains can go on in parallel.
Even a small percentage of miners can continue building the chain that, for them, is still the longest *valid* one. Block times would increase, but only until difficulty readjusts.
In the end, if both chains persist (i.e., retain economic support), the rational strategy for miners is to mine both of them. The ratio of values of chain A relative to chain B determines the optimal split in hashing power that they would (globally) dedicate to mine them. E.g., if `val_A = 4 val_B` then the optimal split is `HP_A = 20%, HP_B = 80%`.

So, in your example of a seg-wit double spending, the 77% will not relay it or mine it because it is not standard, and the 23% will not relay it or mine it because it has an invalid witness. No one will relay it or mine it and no one will be at risk.

The 21M can definitely change today, to a **lower** value. This requires no forks at all: The block reward is actually a *block reward limit*; individual miners are free to reduce it in their blocks.
What is a bit more problematic is to **raise** it over 21M (actually, over 20999999.97690000; the reward becomes 0 after the 33rd halving). It would be nearly impossible today. I am quite confident that there would be economic consensus to change the PoW algorithm if miners were stupid enough to use code with such an increase.
Nevertheless, I am a bit worried: In the future, this situation may change. Especially if development shifts from the current status of opt-in softforks to a new one with mandatory hardforks every other trimester. This and larger blocks could make not impossible a future where essentially all nodes are run by mining pools, exchanges, lightwallet vendors, API providers and "foundations". Reaching that point, then it might not be impossible that they push for a hardfork that increases the coin supply.
Of course it would not be presented like that. Bitcoins are just an UI abstraction: the blockchain only contains amounts expressed as integers and equivalent to satoshis. They would say that the 21M (i.e., the halving schedule) is nominally preserved, but that they introduce a very very tiny rate of demurrage in order to fund mining and secure the blockchain (reasonably, far-from-full blocks and IBLT would imply that transaction fees stay permanently low, and so they are not enough).
I truly hope that I am wrong, but I do not see it as something unimaginable, especially if contentious hardforks like Classic succeed in taking over. Notice also that there is a precedent in Dogecoin: They had a supply limit in the beginning and they later hardforked to remove it to permanent inflation. Also, [influential bloggers are already pushing for it](

This is false.
The pegging is not necessarily fixed and you can have things like e.g., demurrage on the tokens or even valuation based on some fixed schedule, voting mechanism or oracle input. The only limitation is that if X bitcoins get in no more than X bitcoins can get out. This makes a ceiling for the exchange rate against BTC but, if pegging is permissionless, this is more of a feature than a bug: mainnet bitcoins would simply flood in if the exchange rate ever got above parity.
Furthermore, sidechains can have issuance on their own that is mixable with the pegged-in inputs. I expect that in this case the sidechain tokens be not fungible and its worth depend on how much of the coin history is BTC and how much is worthless inflation. But other users' valuations could differ.

The point is more like "cheap electricity is scarce" (here I mean cheapest in the world, not just "relatively inexpensive") so hashing on these locations drives up the price of the electricity down there. As returns diminish, other locations become marginally profitable and reached that point, mining cannot concentrate more.
Additionally to this fact, heat dissipation also limits the size of the mining farms (and if you add forced cooling, then this reduces the efficiency).

More concretely, fees are as low as the marginal cost of including the transaction which, if blocks are not full, translates to the marginal cost of *propagating* the transaction in the newly found block which, if IBLT/weakblock/BitcoinNG are used, they become practically negligible (even if still strictly positive).

AFAICT, all these "permissioned blockchains" actually refer to a very generalized concept, largely distant from Bitcoin's blockchain, and meaning nothing more than "distributed database with signed commits".
There is nothing new here. They however can be made quite efficient, maybe even useful for banks.
Le us consider, e.g., `git`: It is really efficiently designed: Fully distributed, structured in generalized Merkle trees, with signed commits, self healing and self pruning. This has made that what started as a system for code version control is now used much more generally (see etckeeper or git-home-history). You can probably optimize it further if you restrict it to account balances.
It is years old technology and it does not solve counterparty risk at all, so it is likely that all these "private blockchain" startups are just trying to sell smoke.

The problem with this is that, in a decentralized system, you cannot know if the miners are secretly doing a softork.
You can only know if the blockchain is respecting a set of rules or not. But you cannot tell if it is indeed following a more restrictive subset.
This fact is an "involuntary security downgrade" only if you assume that the system is already centralized, i.e., only if there is an *official set of rules*. 
Personally, as a peer in the network, I only care about the rules coded in my node. I do not mine any more. I run a node, principally, to know if I was paid, and softforks do not change my certainty about this.

**The** blockchain is a poor payment system (and instead a rather good immutable / uncensorable system). There are no bitcoins in the blockchain; *Bitcoin* is an abstraction and as such I expect it to incorporate good payment systems (like the Lightning Network), as an integral component, which do offer cheap/instant payments.
Bitcoins locked in sidechains or payment channels are still proper bitcoins in nearly every sense, and that is why I think that we could properly call the ensemble (mainnet chain + sidechains + channels) Bitcoin. In the future, I think that most of Bitcoin's evolution will be in that sense (e.g., we could see a day where a revolutionary, really advantageous sidechain is upgraded via softfork to full security as an extended block of the mainnet).

Well, you *can allow more than that* it is just that then there may not be enough BTC for everyone in case of a bank run on the sidechain side. In other words, it is technically possible, just undesirable as a fair system.
If you accept, as I mentioned, that limited supply is advantageous for the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem, then this is a strength not a limitation. Altchain (non-pegged) proliferation is practically free, and as such it leads to unlimited inflation for any non-zero value of their tokens. A single chain is cheaper and more secure, and because of these and Metcalfe's law, more valuable. It is therefore an attractor of the collective dynamics.
Personally, I do not find demurrage, redistribution or oracle-based valuation any valuable (so I would stick with fixed-pegging sidechains) but other may value these; the presence of variable pegging does not affect my proposition.

Every altchain I have seen has some concept of *address*, *wallet* or other type of *ownership*. As such, it can very simply copied as a one-way-pegged sidechain, which is enough for what I have enunciated (security at least for the pre-pegging leg, and lack of inflation).
If we want two-way pegging, which may ensure stronger value preservation, have a look at Sztorc's drivechains  . They can be done on nearly everything, even open ledgers that are not blockchains, and they have the additional advantage of security preservation incentives.
These require no specific adaptation form the Bitcoin side, and very minimal adaptation to the sidechain.

Bad wording from me, probably. Call me pessimistic, but renting 51% (for a short period, at least) does not seem unthinkable to me. Stratum pooling is essentially this. And pool operators have little at stake; they can easily get hacked, coerced, or probably even bought.
A key security assumption in Bitcoin is that the proof of work also secures the block chain, not only distributes scarce tokens. This is the genius point that made Bitcoin possible from bricks that are decades old tech. Pooled mining respects this only in the proper sense of pooled mining, which is what p2pool or GBT do. However, many so called "pools" are truly not: What *stratum* does is more like buying hashing power in exchange for a reward.
When I say that "farm operators react" I mean that they can choose to mine at a pool or another or on their own. They do have to recoup the costs of their expensive miners, as well as future profit expectations, so they will react if they see that they are contributing to an attack, but it could take several confirmations for this.
One nice and reassuring empirical observation about Bitcoin is that the security (the target difficulty) appears to follow the price. This mechanism ensures that more valuable bitcoins will get better security. Colored coins break this. The transaction of a trillion dollar satoshi could get reversed for a tiny fraction of its worth.

No. Notice that the honest nodes, not being aware of the hard-fork logic, still see the attacking block as valid.

@_date: 2016-03-01 10:40:13
As long as there is transaction demand with non-zero fee, the individual incentive is to make blocks as large as (contractually) possible. Orphan risk does increase at large sizes, but with IBLTs and weak blocks this dependency gets greatly diminished.
The exact same thing happens with the subsidy part of the reward: Miners can --and valid in today's rules-- voluntarily reduce it to less than the 25 btc. But they will not.

If what Satoshi thought matters, I would bet he understood the incentive incompatibility of uneconomical uses of an immutable universal ledger, which externalize their costs to the node operators. I.e., Satoshi (as mostly everyone else) would have desired free/cheap **transactions**, but certainly not shapeshifts, factoms or satoshidice.
The system needs full nodes to run. Pseudonodes or cloud-based semi-pseudonodes do not count. Spam is unavoidable in a permissionless system and therefore it needs fees. And fees need limited blocks (or risk be driven by network connectivity, which centralizes).
@_date: 2016-01-21 21:16:01


That figure is just to describe an example.
That said, trustless consensus requires a unique ledger. Once it splits in multiple incompatible ones, without economic unanimity about which one to follow, the key fundament that supports Bitcoin is lost. How reached that point the resulting system retains *any* value is beyond me. You could argue that as long as non-coinbase transactions persist in both chains and there is no double spendings, that the forked system would still retain some of the functions, but as soon as conbases mature and so the UTXOs sets begin to exponentially diverge, this will be no longer possible.


Is that a word?


True. And this is indeed the only aspect that can avoid the split, which is arguably the worst possible outcome. If both subchains survive until the readjusting point, then it would be rational to extend both in parallel, at least until an economic unanimity of the system chooses one side or the other.

Everyone prefers smaller fees *personally*. However, Bitcoin's worth is derived from its immutability and censorship resistance, and there is a degree of centralization where these guarantees no longer hold. Therefore, if it takes large fees to preserve these properties, so be it.


There is no such think as *possession of bitcoins* at the protocol level. Bitcoin, the unit, itself is just an UX abstraction not directly present on the blockchain. Bitcoin's state is a set of UTXOs and its so called *transactions* are the redemption of one or more of these that allow the creation of new ones.
In the same sense that *bitcoins* are never literally on the chain, and because they are an abstracted unit of value, we can properly say thinks like "bitcoins going to or coming from the LN" or "bitcoins going to or coming from a sidechain". I.e., *being sent to an address whose private key is possessed by an entity* might still be called *possession*, but *being sent to an address that is a smart-contract locking* can hardly be defined as such.

You are obviously no shill, and you are certainly technically literate in Bitcoin.
Why then do you think there is anything good in promoting an incompatible change of rules that challenges the very fundament of why Bitcoin works, namely Byzantine fault tolerance?
We are facing two competing and mutually incompatible scaling plans.
The worse possible outcome of this war is two mutually incompatible competing chains (i.e., Classic at 75% and Core at 25%, percents referring to miner support, economic support and userbase in a similar order). A contentious hardfork risks ending in this state.
Less worse than this, but still not good would be to be forced to a contentious change of rules. This has arguably [never happened before and old nodes are still capable of validating today's blockchain]( This would give (Classic) devs absolute control of the system, which is not the case now: E.g., I refused to do P2SH and I will refuse SegWit too, yet I am perfectly fine since these changes are entirely optional. On the contrary, if Classic takes over, I will be forced to upgrade and be subject to dev's alterations of the rules.
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:44:50
It is hard to know, but I would bet that an economic majority would indeed support a very moderate increase to a 8MB block weight limit (grandparent's "2MB of nonwitness data"). Today, few transactions are witness-heavy so 8MB-big poison blocks would cost a lot of fee revenue to miners mining them, and the fee-optimal size would be probably around 3.4MB (for nearly full segwit adoption). This was clearly a bit too much two years ago (as evidenced by research), but considering that we hard-fork two years from now, it will probably be safe enough then.

Not at all. Please read: 
With only a 20% of defectors it is likely that the hardfork is triggered with minority support (i.e., 49% genuine support). A single pool of the big ones or two of the secondary ones could do this alone.
The only defense against this is requiring an overwhelming supermajority for triggering (e.g., something above 95%) but then this would mean that the change is hardly contentious already.

Meaning that devs force everyone to upgrade (either that or rebel *en masse*, or stop using Bitcoin), which implies that a centralized team can control Bitcoin. Also, the anyonecanspend point is moot, because unupgraded nodes will not receive segwit tx and so are unaffected by it, and they should not care about other people's money.


So that many will continue favoring splitting (1 input 2 outputs) over joining thus further stressing the UTXO.

Sorry, but I cannot see any merits in BitcoinClassic. There may be some merit to a bump to 2MB (yet it is a solution rather clearly inferior to SegWit). Nevertheless, thinking that just 75% of the miners can force *every other peer on the system* to upgrade or, even worse, having Bitcoin and BitcoinClassic coexisting in a value-preserving situation, are plain absurd.

This is the central point in my view. Sure that hardforks can be *cleaner*, but Bitcoin is about the safety brought by decentralization; this is hard, complex and costly, and it may not lead to the cleanest code.
Bitcoin has never hardforked, i.e., [each and every release can validate the current blockchain]( This means that we are certain that every peer, upgraded or not, is able to validate her coins (she may not be able to mine, but this is secondary, or validate newer transactions, but this is irrelevant to her).
Because of this, I strongly feel that the necessary increases in the blocksize should be performed as a softfork, in the form of extended blocks.

We finally agree!


Notice that I said nothing like that. 
Let us say that your view is that "rules A, B and C can change, D, E and F cannot". Unless my view of what is allowed to change and what is forbidden is exactly the same, then there is a risk that *some* of the changes you do will be contentious for me.
The only solution is probably to stick to the rules we all agreed to when we enrolled, unless / until there is no contention to change them. Notice that going to *a more restrictive subset* of these is fine, because if the subset is valid then the original set is necessarily valid too (running a node is nothing more and nothing less than validating whether rules are being followed or not).


You mean evil softforks? A hardfork that reverts it is probably justified in case of an evil softfork, though reached that point Bitcoin is probably already dead.
I specifically mentioned softforks that offer an optional choice.  E.g., we leave regular blocks with today's rules and introduce an extended block with whatever rules. Notice that in case the extended block has newer coin issuance, then this breaks fungibility. Importantly, extended block issuance would never reach the main blocks, so extended blocks are essentially a fully validated sidechain in this case. I expect in consequence that main-block coins would retain today's value and extended-block coins would be scamcoin-size valued, with a continuous crossover for UTXOs in the extended block with mixed origins. Therefore, in practice, there would be no increase of the 21M limit.
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:22:20


I hear this argument rather commonly, but I cannot understand it. Nobody should care about money that is not theirs. Non-upgraded nodes are perfectly safe for validating payments to their addresses. The only degradation there is that Finney attacks are slightly easier (but safe use already says to wait for confirmations for high valued transactions).
More than this, a cartel of miners might have already secretely deployed a softfork and we have no way to know; it is not an issue for non-miners.

It is a public goods problem. If everyone hoarded absolutely everything, new users would never be able to join. But by spending a small share, new users have come in and now make the coins more valuable.
Me, I also contributed my grain of sand too. I spent a bit and I was hoping to buy back in (the same BTC amount) but the few days delay made it impossible (without a huge overcost). If the price falls again, I will buy them back, but I really hope that it does not.
Consistently beaten by buy-and-hold is the equilibrium state of the typical Bitcoin user (or said better, Bitcoin value giver). Pure hodlers are somewhat freeriders in that sense (though they are certainly using the most rational and profitable strategy).

I do not know if I am from the first or the second round (2012). I see how Bitcoin can be a monetary liberator only if it stays censorship resistant (which, like it or not, requires that full nodes are cheap to run, and so, that blocks stay reasonably small and free from uneconomical uses like lotteries, factoms or diamond registrations). I am wary of the centralization risks and I consider that even having a *scalability roadmap* puts unnecessary emphasis on a certain code repo as a reference implementation (what I mean: *releases* may be reference implementations --consensus needs bit-exactness which no generic specification can currently guarantee-- and they may be coherent between each other, but having a *reference repo* removes the optionality, at the moral level at least, and risks adding a central point of failure).
But, with all that said, I have a strong cognitive dissonance with that because, personally, I have little saving capacity and the amount that I can safely afford to lose is even less. In consequence, I only have a small quantity of Bitcoins, too small to be a *liberator* for me. I do not do drugs or illegal stuff, and I have no way to hide my income from taxation. And that is when the greedy in me says *just fly me to the Moon, baby, whatever it takes, even if it is on a Coinbase rocket with Roger, Erik and other conmen as pilots*.

That would certainly damage Bitcoin's value, but it could still be adopted if it becomes the only way to secure the blockchain (leaving an insecure blockchain would be a worse result).
When the block subsidy falls well below the fees, the incentive to follow the longest chain is present iff blocks are full or nearly full (otherwise it would get more profitable to ignore the top block and steal its transaction fees). But, on the other hand, permanently full blocks give a terrible user experience.
It is an unsolved problem and I would not be very surprised if, reaching that point, some users are willing to concede a tiny inflation rate to ensure the blockchain security.
Notice that this is more than a theoretical speculation: It has already happened with Dogecoin. The reward was getting tiny and the users decided to hardfork to leave a permanent ~5% inflation.

The problem with this is that you cannot tell from blockchain analysis whether the coins have changed hands in a transaction or not. So, in some cases, you end up limiting the *fungibility* of some compliant users' coins too.
You are right that, in principle, it is the actors and not the units that are restricted. Nevertheless, the way Bitcoin works, there is no way to restore the coin taint (other than with extensive mixing and, hopefully available some day, zero knowledge transactions) and so actor restriction implies unit restriction. Please look specifically at Chainalysis proposition.

Much more than 67% of the hashing power is not anonymous; the same for more than 67% of the exchanges and "economic actors". They are thus censurable and regulatory capturable: If they can set what Bitcoin is, then we have already lost.
Fortunately, Gavin is ignoring a key aspect: Miners will not adopt contentious hardforks because these would decimate Bitcoin's short-term price. Even if the minority of the hashing power reintegrates to the majority branch (i.e., they would not wait for the difficulty readjustment), the minority "economic value" will be lost, partially at least. E.g., by Metcalfe's law, even the branch of the 80% of the economic majority will see a 36% drop in value (or a much worse 55% drop for a *supermajority* 67% case).
Therefore, even if the hardforking change could be theoretiically beneficial in the long term, miners operate on tight margins and so would greedily reject it. Until it gets consensus.

The whitepaper is a high level description that does not describe the details of how blocks are structured (other than the general outline shown in some of the figures). The important thing is that, for Satoshi, "longest chain" means "longest chain that is made of valid blocks". Notice also that when he describes "competing chains", he exclusively considers chains that differ in the ordering, but are otherwise equally valid.
And for what it is worth, independently of the block size, BU is also proposing new, incompatible transactions.

From section 8: Simplified Payment Verification:


He does not explicitly mentioned *fraud proofs*, but these are probably the only way to implement such *alerts* in a safe way.
Also importantly, Satoshi viewed SPV as a *light mode* for the P2P nodes (which would fall back to full validation in case of multiple chains) and not as a separate *light client*.

It is his sub and he can moderate it as he wants; this has nothing to do with anyone's freedom of speech.
Moderation here is rather transparent and based on a clear policy (which annoys shitcoin pumpers like Roger). There, it is based on arbitrary judgments by the mods. But this is OK; this just makes rbtc a shitty place. 
In the end, a typical redditor-bitcoiner should probably not need to visit rbtc or rbuttcoin more than extremely occasionally, if ever.

What frightens me the most is that BU opposers seem too much focused on BU's code quality as if it was its biggest flaw.

Anyway, Bitcoin is better associated with the dark net. When a currency is used in ransomware, pedophilia and arms/drugs dark-net markets, it means that it has the right properties of money and that it is working properly. Reputation is irrelevant.

Just like Bitcoin transactions, SWIFT transactions are signed. Bangladesh's Central Bank leaked their private key, so the transaction was authentic. 
By definition, in this context, it is *your* money if you have the private key.

Only if the chain with today's rules (the one I, rather reasonably, called Bitcoin) dies. 
If it does not, and if the Classic chain persists in parallel, then the chain with newer rules should alter the transaction format to operate safely. Since this result cannot be discarded, they should do it now before releasing any software that hardforks.
If we reach a point where some transactions are valid only in chain A, some valid only in chain B, and some valid in both, then it would result in a mess that would precipitate one chain killing the other with both ending severely damaged, which is probably not the optimal value preserving result.
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:08:17
Do not worry: No, you have not lost the money.
It is not confirming because the fee is too low. You should upgrade to the last version of Electrum, which has very good fee control. Then you have two options:
 - Wait a few days until it gets confirmed (fees go down in the weekend)
 - Use the CPFP option on the pending transaction to bump up the fee
@_date: 2016-03-29 11:54:00
An interesting read indeed. It basically uses two arguments: The first, that on-chain transactions cannot legally be considered as transmissions of ownership; the second, that colored coins or meta coins undermine Bitcoin's security assumption by being incentive incompatible.
I strongly agree with that second argument, and I think Tim could have emphasized it in his critique (instead of his absurd *probabilistic consensus* nonsense). 
However, I disagree with the first argument: In the case of the Bangladeshi central bank's "hacked" SWIFT key, the FED itself is defending that proof of ownership of a private key legally proves the validity of a transfer of funds. This should not be different in a blockchain, be it permissioned or public, for if we are supposed to be able to challenge the validity of the ledger, then there is little advantage in using it in the first place.
@_date: 2016-03-30 22:07:48
Interesting, indeed. Actually, I am aware of this and, some time ago, I invented a machine where you would input bitcoins in a bitnode Raspberry Pi and, through proof-of-burn, it would liberate a sufficient amount of exergy that would be capable of synthesizing a decent quantity of 3d-printable aluminum. 
I never built it because the price of bitcoins skyrocketed to a point where it is no longer profitable to do it. Also, I am interested in obtaining rare metals, not electrically produced ones. But I guess that I could use my machine in a spacecraft for asteroid mining, for 3d-printing aluminum bites. It should still be cheaper than spacelifting them from the surface, and in the end I would get the rare metals.

It will be enabled by default for miners to accept them. Payers (*customers*) will send non-replaceable transactions by default. Actually, there is currently no wallet that can send replaceable transactions, not even as an option; you need to manually craft transactions to *opt-in* to RBF.

Inflation is a crime. It is a very unfair hidden tax supported by the middle class. The rich will always have access to high yield investments to escape from it, but for the rest of us, for the unprivileged, the only way to escape from inflation is to have nothing (and alternatives like gold have high fees and high risk of theft).
Fortunately, Bitcoin has changed this.
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:37:50
I see no reason why the channel topology should be different from the current payment topology: small world, with high degree heterogeneity and scale free (no hubs).
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:56:13
I mostly agree with your analysis. However, I do not think that, in practice, today, we can say that we have any working *fee market*. Have a look at that heterogeneity:  People are paying 60c even when 12c would suffice!
Today only Electrum (and even then only in its last version which appeared last week) has a nice GUI for adjusting RBF and CPFP. Exchanges just use fixed fees, and all the other wallets do some kind of *estimation* that works little better than blind guessing.
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:51:51


Not in an incentive compatible way, though. If it is exclusively only the miners that are enforcing a softfork, it can easily get dropped and this would not affect the acceptability of their blocks (by the regular nodes - Bitcoin value givers). Therefore, acknowledging that such a thing is possible, on the appearance of an old-valid block, miners would rationally drop the softork and extend that block. Signaling does not help here, because if trusted it would be abused to knock off competition (this is the complementary case of the *notbitcoinXT* early activation forcing). By extension of this argument, only-miner softforks would rationally not activate in the first place. 
That said, there may exist very specific cases e.g., softfork that makes life very much better for miners, for which the added collective benefit could switch the Nash equilibrium to cooperate-cooperate; signaling could be trusted in that case because of that. Miners *could be* sufficient for the activation of *some* softforks.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:15:04
I probably misunderstood your comment then. 
Still, I insist that, in my case at least, the stock market fees are orders of magnitude higher than for Bitcoin. I am poor: Most of my money is in Bitcoin yet I do not have more than a handful of BTC. I have bought my coins at less than 0.5% fee mostly from bitcoin.de (this was before Bitsquare was available). As long as I have less than 10 000 €, I am not required to tell anything to the taxman.
In the stock market, however, I am getting a net 0.66% (out of the gross 2.5% return that has the *best performing* fund available at my bank, which is the second biggest one). If I were to invest directly in stocks, and still wanted a diversified portfolio, it would be even costlier. And then the taxman would invariably take his big share.

Two first questions: yes and yes.
Third one: no, not necessarily. A vulnerability in one can weaken the entire train (in practice, this is used in MD5 collisions, which today can be quickly obtained even for checksummed files, like ZIP, and not only for raw files). And in fact, SCRYPT already uses SHA2 steps in it.
AFAIK, the reason for doing SHA256(SHA256()) is because a SHA2 theoretical vulnerability for known size of the preimage, and RIPEMD(SHA256()) is because RIPEMD is 160 bits (enough for the 128-bit security of signatures) while shortest SHA2 is 224.
@_date: 2016-01-06 09:14:23


You are totally right for the default implementation.
But keep in mind that miners are incentivized to ignore that flag (and XT nodes will happily propagate all your double spending transactions, be them flagged or not).
0-conf works only because of honor and altruism, and this is the case with or without RBF.
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:25:27
I truly hope you are right!
If BitcoinClassic succeeds in pushing a contentious hardfork down our throats, then I would not feel safe that the "26-bitcoin hardfork" is absolutely impossible; it sure would not lack miner support.
@_date: 2016-01-17 10:11:52
Let me notice that the supply *limit* is also about the maximum possible number of coins: A block with a coinbase of 24 coins instead of 25 is fully valid.
Miners are incetivized to push for and get the maximum possible.

It is indeed a genius development, but I see it only as a testbed for Bitcoin. Please have a look at *confidential transactions*, which is a further improvement over that.
Smooth issuance is indeed marginally advantageous. Bitcoin would not have bootstrapped with it though: Four years after, the subsidy was still 50 BTC and still lots of people complained that early adopters got unfairly rewarded.
Finally, flexible size limit is gameable. Miners have a fixed pie to share among each other, so they have every incentive in driving out their lesser connected competition. In an adversarial, non altruistic setting (which is expectable once the system goes mainstream) this leads to an unacceptable semi-centralization where block production is only profitable at the very backbone of the internet, i.e., at visible locations that are thus censurable / reg capturable.

Your definition implies that [Aethereum]( is not an altcoin and may one day become Bitcoin. Yet, few would agree with this (IMHO promotion of aethereum as a Bitcoin substitute should be rightfully deemed off-topic here).
I would also argue that all the *unlimited supply* forks are also altcoins. Economic majority is not enough for them to become Bitcoin; we would need something close to unanimity (e.g., in an event like that, it would be justified to change the hashing algorithm to preserve the original, limited-supply chain).

Big miners can arrange direct connections between each other and have some degree of trust in their risk evaluation. Given that a majority is inside the Great Firewall, they actually have *orphan premiums* i.e., can win big-block races even if they are late.

This will probably not happen, but it does not matter. The beauty of a UASF is that it needs only an economic *majority*, but then it activates for everyone.

It is not irrelevant. Please read again what I said; or maybe I did not express myself clearly enough. 
Had you haircutted only BTC balances then yes, you would be solvent back then and also now (I say *you* because you still worked there at that time). But this is not what you did! Instead, you haircutted only a part of BTC and confiscated a proportional part of fiat at contemporary valuation, so that it covered the hacked amount. The fact that BFX are USD-denominiated is irrelevant! The same that I said would be true if you distributed no BFX at all!
Normally, Bitfinex should have been buying bitcoins with the confiscated fiat until haircutted amounts would balance out, but you had not opportunity of doing that, because the price has only strictly increased since then (so, if you did not buy, you are insolvent, and if you bought at a higher price, you are insolvent too). 
Now, own resources and cumulated fee revenue might outbalance that issue, (and make you overall solvent) but you cannot deny it.

Not a big increase? Of course: Much bigger blocks are not safe, and blocksize increase is only a side effect of segwit (and I am all for bigger blocks; they can perfectly happen independently of segwit, when they are needed). Technical debt? For the love of God! Absolutely each and every new functionality incorporated to Bitcoin will cause *technical debt*; you cannot remove or replace functionalities in Bitcoin because that would imply that some coins get potentially confiscated. And finally: "There are also criticisms of SegWit that are not related to SegWit itself". Oh really?

Yes, fees on the LN are percent based, but they are of different nature: You pay a positive fee for each channel-hop that gets more unbalanced, and get a negative fee for each one that gets rebalanced. Also, if there are multiple paths (a highly likely scenario; link creation is riskless and permissionless) fees will be tiny. So, in the end, $10 mil for $1 on the LN is not unthinkable.

UASF is flag-day-based activation; there is no readiness *signaling* in it analogous to the one used for a MASF. 
The only (game-theoretic) signaling that can affect it is the one coming from well established payment processors or from big buyers/hodlers doing some sort of public commitment through centralized (read corruptible) channels. Node count does not mean anything as it costs literally nothing to spin up many fakenodes. 
UASF is just a reminder to miners that the economic majority is the only thing that matters for defining Bitcoin; hashing power will follow to protect a chain that is valuable, not magically *make it valuable*. Still, it is risky business in practice and may end up with messy activations that have many-blocks-long reorgs and require active intervention to heal. In other words, I see a UASF as a way to push its corresponding MASF so that it is not required in the first place, but it would not be without damage (still if likely survivable) if it is actually performed.

A majority mining cartel could secretly implement a soft-fork and no validator would ever know it.
I fully agree for the rest, though. Soft-forks are changes of the rules to a more restrictive subset. While compatible, they are changes nonetheless, and as such they should not be forced to the users or made official in any way, because this would make a central point of failure.
In the future, I expect that Bitcoin will have no more than one hard-fork and a couple of soft-forks per decade, and side-chains will lead most of the innovation.

What is the purpose of using **the** blockchain then? One of the advantages of colored coins is supposed to be that you can write their transferable IOU issuance contract as something like "pay X Apple shares to the party capable of proving the she authored a redeem transaction". This is a valid form of ownership; in particular, it is the one being recognized by the FED for the recent Bangladeshi SWIFT key "hack". 
If you are supposed to be able to challenge the state of the universal ledger, then there is no point in using it in the first place. At the very least, you would be better using Ripple, where there is a leading miner that can force invalid transactions, but there are probably more efficient solutions at this point.

It defaults to enable the choice, which you can still disable (for your blocks / for transactions that pass through your node).

Concretely, all the unused NOP opcodes return true by default, so that their new behavior assigned in the future stays forwards compatible with older clients (i.e., repurposing them is always necessarily a safer softfork).

I certainly agree that knowing the exact set of rules being followed is superior to just knowing a superset of these rules.

I would say that I am a rather typical bitcoiner; I do around three transactions per week. My cost of running a node is a big factor higher than my total cost in fees. BU would probably soon make it even more expensive.
Or do you count SPV and Bitcoin banks too? On the absence of fraud proofs (i.e., the *true* SPV as described in the whitepaper), if you do not validate your transactions, you are not using Bitcoin: You are trusting someone else to do it for you.
If you have the keys and make the signatures (case of Electrum, Mycelium, etc.), it is surely better than nothing, but still not enough; it is *trustless* when you pay but *trusting* when you receive. If there still are many people independently running nodes, you could maybe free ride on them, but this mode of operation has catastrophic degradation at some point. If nearly everyone piggybacks and only a few validate, then it is better to remove mining and blocks, and have instead a federated system between these.

Inelastic supply means that the extra capacity may actually decrease the total fee revenue (not just the per-byte ratio), all the other things equal.

Actually, it has little to do with multisig. Slides are not symmetrical: one is random data (one-time pad) and the other is the QR ciphered with it. Any single slide leaks nothing.
That said, you could try a M-of-N implementation, following a different scheme, e.g., if you split the blacks of the QR. If you do this for a 2-of-N case, then having one of the slides would leak 50% of your secret (+ the QR error correction, in theory), which [might not be that bad]( but you would still be reducing the search space of your secret anyway (QR-encoding is, necessarily, a 2-way function).
A safer implementation might be to give a copy of the one-time pad to each trustee and M-of-N-split the ciphered image, or *vice versa*.

Shortly: Blocksize limit is removed and it gets substituted by *blockweight* limit, which is 4MB (an actual consensus limit, not an estimate). This is an *explicit* increase. Actual block sizes in the usual serialization will probably be in the 1.8-2.5MB range, but this does not matter.
And sure it is a softfork: Satoshi intentionally left unused op-codes for future functionality. A new type of signature, like it is the case for segwit, will not be invalidated by unupgraded nodes. The trick is that the signature (witness) is segregated from the rest of the transaction: Old nodes will not look it up, so they still see the old "1MB" size limit as being respected.

I am afraid that you might be confusing *individual* incentives with *collective* ones. Miners would collectively benefit from smaller blocks to force higher fees, but individually they will include as much as they can. Bitcoin is permissionless so cartel behavior cannot be enforced.
Soft cap is just the default setting; barring propagation costs, it makes no economic sense to make it any smaller than the hard cap.

The genesis block is one more of the consensus rules, not different from the others.
Coins like Clams and Aethereum follow Bitcoin's genesis block and transactions until the coin distribution at launch. Are not they altcoins though?
Bitcoin has, by definition, a single blockchain. Its rules can be evolutionary. However, if a fork causes a schism in a way that both subchains persist, then you cannot obviously call both *Bitcoin*.
Notice also that this is not a *let the market decide* situation. Forks are mutually incompatible, so each of them decimates the value. Even a 75% subchain has, by Metcalfe's law, only 56% of the value (and this is not counting the loss of confidence that the schism would provoke).

You look deeply confused. Since the first version, Bitcoin transactions have always been smart contracts written in script.
P2PK and P2PKH are just standard  mechanisms and always a subset of validity. 
Additionally, Satoshi explicitly left the NOP opcodes for future functionality.

But they can copy paste addresses. Also, they certainly SHOULD have saved the seed somewhere, so nothing is really lost.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:21:34
Right. There is no way to prevent softforks though; some of them can be dangerous and they can be proposed and they *will be* proposed. Bitcoin can only work if we recognize that devs might be compromised at any time.
All of this does not change the fact that, for honest upgrades, they can be made opt-in as a softfork, but they are compulsory as a softfork (by definition).
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:45:13
An alternative and perhaps more radical tactics would be a softfork that invalidates coinbases that signal support for Classic. These way, miners would have an incentive to hide their support for Classic even if they do. Without the signaling, the hardfork activation mechanism would never trigger.
This way, Classic would either back off and compromise on the scalability roadmap, or checkpoint their chain and so openly show that they are an attack.
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:17:14
Collectively, yes. If a majority of the validators become censurable or regulatory capturable, then Bitcoin loses practically all of its benefits (at that point we would better use something that is equally weak but much more efficient, like Ripple). And the only reliable way to prevent this is if you validate yourself. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:35:40
Even then, voting is just for the public service of it, yet running a node has also direct selfish benefits: You validate payments made to you, which is especially important if you do not trust your payees (which is one of the main reasons of using Bitcoin in the first place).

I do not think so. No Bitcoin release ever has effectively supported blocks larger than 1MB. That softfork that you mention just made it explicit, but it was later found that it was too optimistic (i.e., that it did not actually restrict anything) as blocks reached ~400kB. Transaction capacity has strictly increased since the beginning.
The only actual coercion that has been implemented, in practice, is the inability to create billions of coins in a transaction via overflow.

There is no forking (soft- nor hard-) in RBF. It is just a local strategy for the memory pool.
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:03:27
It is high risk indeed, though splitting the network is arguably higher risk, and this strategy seeks precisely to avoid it.
Furthermore, the mere announcement of *the possibility of* this strategy, and thus the doubt on the signaling, may be enough deterrence against the hardforking attempt.
@_date: 2016-03-05 09:38:18
Well, if we raise the limit every time we hit it -and BIP109 sends exactly this message- then there is effectively no limit for all practical purposes.
Also, network improvements just paradoxically make this worse not better: If a combination of safe SPV mining, IBLT and weak/thin blocks makes orphaning risk nearly size-independent, then there is no point in excluding any non-zero fee until the block is full.
@_date: 2016-01-31 17:26:59
Airgapped machines may have poor sources of entropy right after boot. This is one of the few reasons why there is a `/dev/random` in addition to the ([otherwise preferable]( `/dev/urandom`.
The solution to reusing *r* values in your signatures is to implement *deterministic signatures*. But if you still want to keep your infrastructure, you can achieve "poor man's deterministic signatures" by seeding your entropy pool with the HMAC of the unsigned transaction.

There was never the promise that, once a miner found a valid header, the rest of the block would be automatically accepted by the economic majority. Yes, miners are required to upgrade to ensure the continued acceptability of their produce. But this is true for any type of fork, soft or hard.
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:53:32
As soon as mining gets specialized, miners generally become net coin sellers. In consequence, price evolution is the master variable and hashing power becomes enslaved to it; price leads, hashrate trails. 
There are a lot of beefy GPUs in the world. If Bitcoin switches algorithm, many will flock in with them. Effective security will be mostly preserved, and energy spent may even increase (as GPU cards are less of a capital investment than ASICs). Furthermore, that situation will be obviously more decentralized than the status quo and so attacks less probable than now.

Yes, something like [*chicken*](


The optimal strategy is that of *there can be only one*:


Rather strikingly, this implies that Theymos' strict moderation policy (i.e., not allowing *discussion* of Classic if it contains a minimal indication of *promotion*) makes perfect sense game theoretically, as it would have the exact opposite strategy (i.e., heavy promotion of Classic as the "true Bitcoin").
Notice additionally that there is no possible compromise in hardforking: **Either Bitcoin hardforks or it does not; it cannot hardfork just a little.** What *is* possible though is a **compromise** for a certain *scalability roadmap*, with which a consensual course of action would turn the game into one where cooperation is the optimal strategy.

Here, this is the most clear example that BU is an attack. They expressly want to create confusion: Dupe SPV clients into thinking that they are receiving BTC when instead they could be getting (necessarily differently valued; not judging if more or less) BTU. Confusion could easily imply single-digit prices.
Yes, SPV need to expressly consent to BU, of course they do! If you are just "very open to hearing ideas" it is because you do not care about confusion or knocking off Bitcoin for a very long time, or maybe because that is exactly your objective.

It is just the opposite: It would be irrational, absurd and a money-losing strategy **not to mine** chain A with at least 20% of the combined hashing power.
Also, hour spaced blocks are not that bad, and it is a temporary problem that eventually corrects itself. As a silver lining, the decreased rate of inflation would push up `val_A`thus attracting further hashing to it all things equal. `HP_A = HP_B = 50%` is a stable point of equilibrium.
@_date: 2016-01-21 11:23:20


This would be the case for a softfork, but not for a hardfork. After the split, there would be two different types of coins, and each one would be separately tradable. If, let us say, today rules' Bitcoins trade at $2 each (I am being optimistic) and ClassiCoins trade at $8, then it would be rational that a 20% of the miners mine the pre-fork Bitcoin and 80% of the miners mine at the Classic blockchain. Both coexisting in parallel.


Please read again the post that I linked: 
As far as we know, the database change only affects the handling of reorganizations, but this does not prevent old nodes from being capable of validating the current blockchain; it is thus not really a hardfork.
I am not sure about what you mean with deprecating openSSL. First of all, the software that does this is not released yet. Even then, all the testing indicates that it is 100% compatible, just faster, i.e., it is not even a softfork.

You already did it!
What you did is a random walk, and a Brownian motion looked at discrete intervals *is a valid realization* of a random walk.
You may want to study Bitcoin's price fluctuations in the framework of *portfolio optimization*. There you have covariance matrices (between assets) instead of just the volatility. Bitcoin is a rare asset in the sense that it has poor correlation with others (equities, debentures, precious metals).
Another unique aspect is Bitcoin's peculiar relationship with its volatility cycles. Lower volatility increases its attractiveness as a *money* and so its projected adoption rate, but this pushes volatility again (negative feedback for + returns); on the other hand, greater volatility decreases the adoption rate projections, reduces its price, and thus further push the volatility (positive feedback for - returns). This asymmetry is quite visible observing the distribution of its rally-crash cycles.

It is actually funny how Rizun talks about concepts from Physics (like impedance and emergence) but he gets them wrong.

It is not impossible, so there is a risk, yes. However, the risk is extremely small. A schism will severely damage value (reduced network effect, confusion, uncertainty) so it will only happen if subchains can position as having a distinct appeal from each other. This happened with ETH/ETC: ETH is the chain by the Foundation where evident fuckups can be reversed; ETC is a more *bazaar*-like chain where Code is Law, independently of massive hacks. I do not see such differentiation possible in BTC/BTU, especially with both claiming the same definition.

To validate that a transaction that is *apparently* paying you is *actually* paying you, you need to build the universal set of UTXOs (if you think that you do not, then please stop using Bitcoin and use something more efficient like central checkpointing, proof of stake, or Ripple).

@_date: 2017-03-09 16:18:29
In the end it is a matter of definition. So, while you are free to define BTC as you want, that definition is not very useful unless it is shared by many others. In your case, I am quite certain that it is not.
If everyone withdraws from the current Bitcoin network and then switches to a new network that has a different set of rules (be it Unlimited or whatever), you could probably claim that the new chain can still be called Bitcoin. However, as long as some people stay in the original chain and keep using it, the new chain will need to find a new name. In the ETH/ETC case, the Foundation owned the ETH trademark and forced its use for the new chain, but in Bitcoin nobody owns any trademark and, therefore, any new chain will have to find a new name. Exchanges -we know from the ETH/ETC experience- will just accept any of the subchains, and they would never risk confusing their users by giving the BTC name (or XBT those that use that) to a new chain unless the original one gets fully abandoned.


This is just a big lie. The whitepaper talks inespecifically about the 1-CPU-1-vote concept. But when he describes the details, he also says very clearly and unambiguously that for him the *longest* chain is the *longest* ***valid*** one. See in section 5:

I am afraid that you might be overestimating a bit the virtues of UTXO commitments. If only miners validate the whole history, they can fake the UTXO. If the main chain accepts whatever SPV proof from the subchain (i.e., no fraud proofs) then there is no point in independent validation, and so you are left with exclusively SPV security.
That is, in the end, UTXO commitments enhance the *best case scenario* but do little on the *worst case scenario*. Their best advantage would be if they could somehow improve the efficiency of fraud proofs, but I do not see how.

It probably works if it is only a very significant economic *minority* too. Miners want to maximize the acceptability of their block: If segwit-valid block is accepted by 100% of the coinbuyers and segwit-invalid one is accepted only by 67%, they rationally would enforce segwit validity.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:49:51
Signaling about softfork readiness can be faked too. Depending on the situation, miners might be incentivized to do so. 
In the end, a UASF  does not necessarily need an economical *majority* behind, just a *significant economical* weight behind, because unupgraded nodes will always accept anything. This could be risky: E.g., with a UASF to 1GB-sized extended blocks, some miners would not be able to afford a datacenter-sized border node.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:16:36
Or not even!
They lost much more coins than they gave tokens: They socialized the losses among all the assets. However, the price has only gone up since then i.e., they have not been able to buy missing bitcoins with confiscated fiat, or at least not entirely. It is therefore entirely possible that they were solvent right after the hack but are insolvent now. BFX token redemption just proves that they have fee revenue and the intention to buy confidence.
Because of that I would not be surprised if it was revealed that they are not at full reserve. Please notice that I do not want to spread any FUD; I think that eventually they will probably be fine.

The way that it is built, the blockchain can resist regulatory capture. And because of that, so does the LN. 
When Paypal bans your account, you are SOL. When Coinbase closes your LN channel, you just make another one with someone else; your only inconvenience will be that fees for you jump from 0.1% to 0.12% or less (fees will never be high on LN; it is permissionless and so there is a run to the bottom; have a look at the Joinmarket to have an idea).
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:15:26
Yes, of course. Price leads and hashrate follows. I see no contradiction with the OP though. On the presence of political manipulation and contentious fork attempts, centralized exchanges can (intentionally or unintentionally) mislead its users. I assume that manipulation precludes me from observing the economic majority, but probably a majority of the hashrate will be able to see it more clearly (they have more skin in the game; while I, as a hodler, get tokens in all the subchains).
What I mean is that Bitcoin cannot depend on what a closed-door meeting of the major exchanges (or the major miners, or the major devs) decides. If the joint letter declaring BTU had decided instead that Unlimited tokens are the true bitcoins, people (that is Bitcoin's value givers) would need to switch to other exchanges. If centralized pools foolishly (meaning against the rational game theoretic incentives) go on with an undesired chain, and so we need to switch to a different algorithm, the hashrate as measured as wasted joules of energy will define which one is the economically backed subchain.
In other words, running a full node works most of the time and precludes most attacks. But if in the middle of a misinformation attack brinkmanship forces us into a hardfork, hashrate (adjusted by spent energy) will be a trailing proxy of what the economic majority considers Bitcoin. 
As much as uncertainty demands conservatism, I for one would not want to be left on a vulnerable subchain. And as much as I am a fanatic believer and have most of my savings in BTC, I would consider leaving if an economic majority follows BU or Core-EC insanities or other centralized closed-door meeting decision.
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:17:39
So, more precisely, users are not forced to upgrade, you are right, as long as they are OK with having less security and a greatly reduced network effect. This is terrible for Bitcoin because it derives its value mostly from its social effects. There is software in my computer that I have compiled myself by adding my own patchset public codebases. I am the only one in the world running it, yet it is extremely valuable to me. Bitcoin is completely different, though: If I get out of sync (consensus wise) then it becomes worthless.


[Clearly not](


Experience shows that a majority of the hashing power use validation-less "SPV" mining. Orphaning has become largely independent of the block size since a long time ago.


Why would miners do not mine on top of it? Also, I mentioned gigabyte-sized blocks as a reply to your "And I think the block size limit should be removed from consensus code" referring to Core, not BU.

No, this is not true.
Once set up, the Lightning Network works off-chain and does not use any block space. The only on-chain transactions are the lockings, which are the on-ramps to the Lightning Network and, eventually, the off-ramp settlements. The former can be indefinitely maintained and the latter are only needed in case of misbehavior, which is not profitable.

Said like that, it touches an "impossible change" and so Big Blockians could dismiss it as a *slippery slope fallacy* ([though this is disputable](
No. However, bitcoins are just UX abstractions. The UTXOs only contain satoshi-denominated quantities. In a Classic future, as the block subsidy vanishes and unlimited blocks cannot push transaction fees (which stay as small as what covers their propagation cost and leave nothing to pay for hashing), a compromise hard-fork could be established that nominally maintains the 21-million limit (an abstraction) but leaves a permanent subsidy defined as a coin demurrage at a tiny rate.
A demurraging coin that is backed by nothing probably cannot stay valuable though. But, hey, it is a payment system after all, and a nice experiment on a Paypal-sized, decentralized (somewhat) one. /s

My biggest fear is that the bumping to 2MB blocks, alone, may not make enough to justify [calling the nuclear option]( However, after a series of salami changes we may soon end up with a very different system.
I said no to P2SH and I plan to say no to SegWit for the time being. That is fine, because they are optional; I can use Bitcoin without these. Hardforks, on the other hand, would force me to upgrade to a Bitcoin that I had not signed up for.

For any reasonably significant amount, always double check the payment address with a second, independent device. Hardware wallets do not count (they cannot independently connect to the internet). [Malware will mutate addresses]( Also, please check every char of the address; attackers know that most people only check the first and last few characters, which are not hard to crack (there is efficient vanitygen software and there are pools where you can easily buy hashing power for it).

A very old convention indeed. Back in the sixties, we had that language called APL which used special symbols as opcodes; it was not very practical. But then came FORTH (a language based on the LISP paradigm) with its ALL CAPS OPCODEs (not exclusive of FORTH, of course, FORTRAN and all the others also used that). When Bitcoin's script implemented (a subset of) FORTH, it came with its notation.

Ethereum is run by *proof-of-Vitalik*. I mean, literally: He effectively owns the trademark (via his Foundation) and as such he gets to decide what is called Ethereum, be it majority or minority chain (as per hashrate, economic weight, dev consensus, or whatever).
Lacking a reference implementation, Ethereum is necessarily ill-defined. There was that time when two implementations (Geth and Parity) came to a consensus split. Everyone held their breath until Vitalik proclaimed that both got it wrong with respect to "the specification", but that in his opinion Parity was "closer" to it (an arbitrary judgment) and so the network reorganized around Parity.
So, fanboys, deny it all that you want, but for me this is clear enough evidence that *Vitalik has absolute power over Ethereum*.

Arguably, being successful in pushing a contentious hardfork evidences that the entity (i.e., the team) behind this move controls the rules of Bitcoin and thus it is actually centralized.
IMHO, if the Toomims, Coinbase and a handful of pool operators can dictate which software I am forced to upgrade to, then Bitcoin has failed for me.
This is independent of the nature and the size of the hardforking change, which should only be deployed in case of unanimous consent.

You do not need permission by anyone to start a sidechain; you just go and release it. You can do it on the mainnet today in the form of one-way pegs. Or you can wait until we have compact SPV proofs or drivechain to have two-way pegs.
If the properties of the sidechain are valuable, then it will be used. Miners will merge-mine it to protect it, so it will be secure, and pegging means that current Bitcoin stakeholders will also be interested in protecting it as it makes Bitcoin more valuable. Actually, sidechain pegged tokens **are bitcoins** in every meaningful way. Ultimately, and by virtue of definition, we can at some point collectively agree that the sidechain is the *new mainnet Bitcoin blockchain*, through a soft-fork in the old one. Any change is possible with this.
Until this last step, which is entirely optional up to a 51% of the hashing power, no changes are needed to the mainnet.
Therefore, new releases by Core, Classic or whatever are not required, and Bitcoin can evolve and stay dominant without any leadership or governance whatsoever. 
Notice that I do not refuse governance: Maybe some degree of governance can be good, it can help to watch out for bugs and it can make the evolution processes smoother. Blockchain forkings should be possible too, as they are a defense against a monopolistic attack where the block generating entity (or cartel) gets regulatory captured and starts censoring transactions. However, and since it is optional, we should not want any governance in Bitcoin that compromises its decentralized nature. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:24:43
Because that is absurd. Hashing power can be distributed (heat dissipation and diminishing returns on cheap energy spots), but connectivity is hierarchical. A too high connectivity dependency of miner reward leads to centralization.
Therefore, I think that you are assuming that mining is already fully centralized to a point where there is no point in trying to decentralize it. Either that or you do not understand the difference between *individual* incentives and *collective* incentives for miners.

Devil's advocate here. I think that we would still need the credible threat of changing the hashing-algorithm, if only to protect against *evil* MASFs and UASFs. 
Example of an evil MASF: After segwit activation (by either method), miners find that the increased capacity lowers fee revenue, so they MASF to deactivate segwit's OP code (let us say with a grace period so that no coins get confiscated).
Example of an evil UASF: The ultimate fungibility break: KYC-only transactions. Some group of users would propose it (or maybe would be *forced to* it, as it happened with Ripple), and so they would UASF, at least for a set of accounts. This would not censor non-KYC users, but their coins could be valued differently. The only way out of that situation would be a split. However, the threat of a preemptive (value damaging) split via HF may be enough to prevent the initial fungibility-destroying UASF in the first place.
@_date: 2016-01-08 17:33:54
Of course it is [fungibility](
If a given coin's worth depends on its taint, then fungibility is certainly affected.
In Bitcoin, the *liquidity related to specific users* aspect affects the *units* that have been associated to those *specific users*. Since a Bitcoin transaction cannot prove whether the coins have changed hands or not, any *user blacklist* translates to a *coin blacklist* (up to, I presume, a certain taint threshold), i.e., *regulatory compliance* affects *fungibility*.

Soft limits are not enforceable. Today, fees are negligible and so miners can safely leave the default soft limit enabled. Nevertheless, once fees become non-negligible compared to the block reward, then defectors (I mean, miners mining with a larger soft limit) will be at advantage.

Not at all! It is probably the clearest sign of where the *economic majority* is (whatever that means), and the fact that you do not like it does not change that.
The effect of the deadline is negligible: If there is no BTU chain by the end of this year, there will never be one (there could be other hardforks, but that is a fully different story). Brinkmanship cannot sustainably extend for that long (or if it really does, it would be because reasonable users would have abandoned the network *en masse* and entrenched tiny clans would still be fighting for sub-dollar coins).
The two coins solution is the worst possible outcome. If the hashrate forks and the market backs that move, BCU will become BTU which will be the "new" Bitcoin (even take its name when the original network dies). Currently, the market says that that is improbable (economic backing, not hashrate backing).

Most of the motivation behind BU resides on the (incentive incompatible) assumption that the longest chain is always the valid one, and so that block validity is hardly checked only as valid header chaining (with the rest of consensus rules enforced by means of *emerging consensus*).

Fees (total, not just individual; it is inelastic supply) will drop *all the other things equal*. But things are not equal: Increased supply will probably bring more transacting (i.e., not just less optimized transacting); it is most probably a case of Jevons paradox. Yes, per-tx fee will decrease but total fee revenue will increase.
This is very good news: It implies that before the next "halvening" Bitcoin will have a healthy fee market and, simultaneously, it will not be too expensive to open a LN channel.
I used to think that a hardfork was necessary for the long-term success of Bitcoin, and so it was distressing to see that it looks like any non-critical hardfork (fix a bug, face a 51% attack, etc.) will probably never have enough widespread consensus. However, I am now convinced that permissionless innovation will find its way one way or the other: It will be 2-way sidechains (SPV secured) or extended blocks (fully secured). Bitcoin can scale, even on-chain, without any central committee dictating what should be the blocksize via centralized meetings and agreements.

Bitcoin is secure because of the incentives, not because of the infeasibility of a majority cartel: A 51% cartel for double spending would not work because individual (sub 51%) miners have every incentive in defecting, and there is no mechanism to punish defectors.
On the contrary, if coordination by 51% in block size limiting (which needs just signaling, not even a cartel) can eat the pie of the 49%, then they have every incentive to do it.

Well, you are right that surviving the difficulty adjustment is not given, though you can interpret it as just a longer-than-usual  coinbase maturity period.

Mining is industrial sized these days. Their margins are tight and they need to sell most of the coins.
On the second point, fees today are mostly determined by demand, not capacity. There is little competition for economically relevant transactions, and economically irrelevant ones (aka spam, like satoshidice and faucets) pay little fees.
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:06:48
I see that our views diverge on this aspect.
Blocks are full of spam by SatoshiDice (and clones), faucetboxes, etc. Economically relevant transactions get mined without issues.

On your 1st point: What is the attack? The appearance of the idiot-fork is unpredictable so attacks would be opportunistic and lack the precise timing required for most double spending attacks.
If a double spending for an already confirmed transaction appears in the network, for whatever reason, the caution should always be to increase the required number of confirmations. The double spending could alternatively be not propagated and instead mined by an attacking miner, but then again she would lack the necessary timing and bet on an unlikely double confluence: idiot-fork appears and gets long enough, and she finds the next newly-valid block.
On your second point: True, but this affects the entire network and hardly *trick old nodes into degraded security*.
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:15:33

I still find it unlikely. Let us say that BTCU has more hashrate, why should BTC accept the same set of miners that have just attacked it? Why not start over with a new algorithm? If BTC stays valuable, hashrate backing its security will follow. On the opposite case, if BTC has more hashrate but BTCU still forks, would users accept the impossibility of SPV when blocksizes just got unlimited?

Add this to the fact that *discussion* of hardfork proposals is on topic (after XT was announced, and for a short cool down period, discussion got restricted to a single thread; we are now back to normal), as long as they do not promote hardforking software.
Later, [Jeff's influential confusion]( did no good (to the "censorship" accusation). He knows that multiple incompatible chains do not lead to a working system, yet he insists that *economic majority* (51%) is enough for justifying a split. Also, that "UTXO preservation at launch" rule would mean that an Aethereum hardfork or a Counterparty softfork would become Bitcoin despite they never claimed anything close to this.

False. Softforks can actually remove a lot of complexity. E.g., consider one that replaces the current script with a more simplified one that just does plain payments.


Again, sidechains or, more simplistically, extended blocks provide unlimited room for improvement without requiring any hardforks. More importantly, they do this while being entirely optional. Hardforks should only be done on unanimous consent, or as [the ultimate deterrence against 51% attacks](


Well, in this case, if rules are not set in stone and can be changed after I consented to them, it is not permissionless for me. Then I do not see how Bitcoin can escape censorship (from my perspective at least) or, in consequence, how it can function as money.

If there is a split, and both subchains keep going forward, users will have 1 post-fork-BTC and 1 BTU for each BTC that they had pre-fork. Since those will be almost certainly valued differently by the market (as an example: BTC at 0.90$ each and BTU at 0.50$ each), it will make sense that people split them properly and treat them separately.
If they fail to do that, attackers will replay transactions from one chain to the other, if only for the lulz. At least this is what happened in the ETH/ETC split.

I do not get it, sorry. If you are a full node, UTXO commitments are superfluous, because you independently have built the UTXO already. And if you are an SPV client, you do not have enough information to validate if they are correct or not. SPVs trust that there are at least some independent parties validating: It makes no difference if those parties validate UTXO or the whole chain, because they can only validate the UTXO commitments if they have validated the whole chain.
You can have some *enhanced SPV mode* with fraud proofs. This means that SPVs do not blindly trust that the most worked header chain is valid. Instead, they trust *a priori* but listen at alerts that it might be not (fraud proofs). Maybe UTXO commitments could help build better fraud proofs, but for me it is not clear how.

Witness discount is not controversial (at least, not technically). It makes, with the current multisig tx mix, roughly 1MB of non-witness + 1.1MB of witness data. Miners get a benefit if transactions spend more outputs, because they need to have most of UTXOs cached on RAM, so this justifies the discount.
However, miners can choose how they price transactions. If cost per-byte is more important for them (e.g., because of transmission costs), they can use it to price transaction inclusion. The weight calculation is just to define a limit; there is no need that miners price tx-weight-unit homogeneously.
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:57:47


This is probably the case today. But in the future, it could be different. It could be the case that future users need to either trust what early adopters say or use a supercomputer to independently validate all the early signatures.
Something in that line happened with Ripple (which is run by proof-of-centralized-company), where most of the early blocks were "lost" in a database fuckup. The set of balances and indexes was conserved, but there is no way to validate which transactions took place in the early history. People can run an independent node and validate newer transactions, but they have to trust whatever Ripple says for those others.

No. Not in a hardfork, that is the whole point of why it is *hard*.


You put a signature for Each input. If you do not segregate the signatures with a discount, it is cheaper to put as few inputs as possible and split them. This is the motivation of the 0.25 weight discount for witness.

This is the only equilibrium point with unlimited blocksizes (and it is an absorbing one; once it is reached, there is no way out) and this is why BU constitution defines an *official* pool.
Closed source and LGPL vio are the *minor* issues compared to this.

Sorry to say that, but that is completely absurd.
LN wallets are normal Bitcoin wallets and as such they produce Bitcoin transactions, on-chain or on-LN. Paying to a legacy address is as simple as paying from the channel output to that address (and signed by both ends). It is equivalent to closing the channel and immediately opening a new one of the same value minus the paid amount, keeping the previous state.
The opposite direction, from oldschool address -&gt; LN does not need any proxy either. Payment requests can contain an optional on-chain address with the LN node address. Alternatively, the payer could pay directly to the channel and then reveal a secret to the paid party (like in stealth addresses), who would share it with her counterparty once they updated the state of the channel.

It will be relatively complicated, due to replay attacks. You will definitely have to take the coins out of cold storage to split them. The safest way to do it, then, would be to buy some BTU and send them to your address. Ensure that it is only BTU, that is, check with a BTU explorer that the coin history has at least one of the sources in a coinbase (fresh minted) of a post-fork BTU block. Then you send all your coins together to an exchange; the presence of that recent input will make the transaction only valid on BTU but not on BTC. You then send your BTC back to cold storage.
There is an easier alternative, but it is riskier: You would just send your transaction with a tiny fee and put it in viabtc's accelerator. Wait for a viabtc block and then double spend with a big fee. This way, the first transaction should only appear on BTU and the second one only on BTC.

It just makes no sense that fees are so heterogeneous. A majority of wallets are massively overpaying; dynamic fees are dysfunctional (yet another proof that that "issue" is a minor one in the eyes of most). 
If fees can dynamically adjust, they will just move quickly to the cut-off point and go no further. This can be done with RBF, but nowadays only Electrum has a nice GUI for doing that, and even then it is a manual process (it could be automatized).

No. BTC and BTU claim to be essentially the same thing. They have technical differences, of course: BTC(Core roadmap at least) wants ultimately flexcap blocksizes, BTU wants emerging consensus (whatever that means); BTC wants few hardforks/safety first, BTU wants frequent hardforks and a more ambitious "break fast &amp; break things" approach. In the end, BTC favors meritocracy while BTU favors politics, but this is not enough differentiation to make both chains desirable. Bitcoin will always be a cypherpunkish coin - a digital gold; bankers already have Ripple and gullible venturecapitalists already have ETH.
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:36:46
Yes, that is unfortunate. All these contentious hardfork attempts (XT, Classic, BU) have pushed some to be hyper-conservative today. 1.5 years ago nearly everyone was doing HF proposals (Adam Back, Peter Todd, Garzik, sipa, btcdrak, etc.), but there has been little progress ever since (Johnson Lau proposed some safety mechanisms, and then Luke made an extremely conservative proposal), and almost no real progress on flexcap. 
Sure, defining how we tune the additional incentive can be problematic, but in the future it is probably the only way forward (either this or we accept that main-chain will never be more than digital gold and all commerce should happen on side-chains). Exponential progression proposals have a big problem: We know for certain (historical evidence) that exponential growth is not sustainable, but it is extremely hard to predict when will it stop. Miners-decide proposals are all gamable. Fork-often kick-the-can-down-the-road proposals mean going back to the Fed model (i.e., having a more or less "official" central committee that dictates policy). So it seems that it is either something in the line of flexcap or 1MBforever.

This. Evidence shows that first coins are made valuable, and then miners flock in to secure them.
The ETC case was a clear example of that (thanks Vitalik!). Initially, ETC's hashrate dropped to nearly zero and stayed there for the first few hours. Then ETC got support at the exchanges (~10% of ETH) and soon we had 10% of the hashing power behind it.
Hashing power does not determine what is valid. Users lead and hashing power follows.

This is why we are being fanatic: It is how it is supposed to be.

Sure there is! There are economically significant transactions, which make bitcoins more valuable. And then there are faucet microtransactions, on-chain dice games and diamond registrations, which are just free-riding on Bitcoin's security. The system can surely tolerate some of that piggybacking, but if it becomes a majority, then the game theoretic assumptions (namely that barring a 51% party miners should collaborate to extend the chain) fall apart. Think about it: Would trillion-valued colored coins be safe with current-valued BTC as a security incentive?

I can see I was not clear enough. 
You agree that, in the absence of 51% faults, Bitcoin *almost surely* reaches Byzantine consensus, right? All Bitcoin value derives from this.
Well, this requires that a set of rules is respected (the ones that I, as a peer in the decentralized network, agree as valid). A subset of those rules can instead be used, but not a superset. Hardforked nodes are, from my perspective, Byzantine faults.
The current Bitcoin is highly resilient. It can still function on sneakernet or with BitSats, under the most hostile environment. However, if I am forced to upgrade to incompatible rule changes every now and then, then I become subject to dev's control. I would better use Ripple then, which has much better throughput, much less overhead, and it is at least open in that their goals do not include censorship resistance.


??? A hardforking solution and a softforking solution do not lead to compatible blockchains. There is no possible compromise either: We cannot hardfork *just a little*: We either hardfork or we do not.
Notice that this does not mean that a compromise *on the roadmap* is not possible, though. On the contrary, it would be the best possible outcome. E.g., something like SegWit softfork now, and a commitment to an eventual blocksize increase when there is no contention, i.e., when there is IBLT and weak blocks, or even something like BitcoinNG, and the realization that the ultimate scaling solution is not feasible as a blockchain (it needs something like treechains and higher level channels like the LN or fidelity bonded processors).

Please read Sztorc's analysis.
Coiledcoin (or, now, Classic Coin) designers may have not fully understood the implications of merge mining, but this does not change their reality: You are asking miners of a *competing* chain to protect your chain. If it adds something (as described by Satoshi and Namecoin devs), they will protect it; if it subtracts value, they will attack it, *by design*.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:38:53
Looks fine to me. LN is trustless; if Coinbase or Bitpay do funny things, they will get easily circumvented. Users that want to avoid them (ideologically or practically) will be able to at really little cost. Today's situation is worse: If Coinbase has your keys, they can steal from you; if instead Coinbase has your only channel, they can at most DoS you for a while (and they have no incentive to do so).
Also, if Bitcoin goes mainstream, there will be many alternative "fiat bridge" actors.
Ultimately, users that earn BTC and spend BTC will certainly have many channels and few of these will be to exchanges.

I get your point, and I fully agree, but let me pick your nits a bit about Clams: They did not really use Bitcoin's genesis block and history other than for choosing a checkpointed snapshot, used as initial distribution (they added also equivalent Litecoin's and Dogecoin's snapshots). From that UTXO set, they removed those dustyly valued and then assigned a fixed amount to the rest. 
Therefore, technically, even *Bitcoin Ultimately Unlimited (BUU) Ivalidatenothing* would reject a Clams chain that happened to have more work than Bitcoin's (which, in the other hand, is impossible, because Clams uses proof of stake).

An important precision: It does validate block's rules; it is just the signatures (whose validation is costliest) that are assumed valid. Also, assumevalid does no hard pinning: If a longer chain is found, the blockchain will reorganize to it. 
Because of that, assumevalid is a mechanism somewhat more robust than checkpoints, which was the mechanism used earlier.

Economically meaningful payments are good for (my) Bitcoin, these outputs could one day reach an address of mine, and so I am willing to store them in my node and relay them to my peers. 
On the other side, satoshi dice, shapeshifts, factoms and counterparties add nothing for me. It may be contentious to define them as *spam* and there is no way to stop them as long as they pay the corresponding fees, but we should not (be forced to) accommodate them with larger block sizes.

Merge mining will be made only if users (not miners) want that both subchains survive. In my opinion, this is not what we have in this (hypothetical) situation, because each subchain will claim to be the one and the only true Bitcoin and so they would fight each other to death. 
Actually, two chains surviving is the worst possible outcome, value wise. Personally, I would even swallow 10MB blocks (I would regretfully stop my node but keep hodling my coins) before having a schism.

Some *evil* softforks could be coercive e.g., one enforcing a blacklist or disabling multisig. However, those are attacks, not softfork upgrades, of the type that justifies a change of the hashing algorithm.
Poor Vitalik he is still thinking in the DAO debacle. In his case, both of his proposals, namely the blacklist softfork and the roll-back hardfork were clearly coercive. I think that even then he is probably wrong, and that a code-is-law splitting chain (ETC) would have gone on also if a softfork was used.

Chris' reply is spot on, do not you agree? Lazy users will exclusively use exchanges as wallets, yes, but this is already the case today.

Yes. This is what I meant. The channel gets closed and immediately reopened, in the same tx than the on-chain payment; the paying party pays the tx fee and they can even do RBF. 
On-chain payment reception is simply done to the address of the LN node public key. Or even it could go to the channel itself: Payment goes to a multisig address like the one that opened the channel, but with ECDH shifted addresses (the payee needs to know the payer's pubkey); once on-chain confirmed, the payee updates the channel state and gives the shared secret to her channel-counterparty.

There is no fundamental requirement for opening and closing channels, and as LN gets more and more adopted, that will be required relatively less often. Ultimately, there is no reason for having onchain utxos in a hotwallet that are not channels.

To the extent of my knowledge, this is not true. It is a common lie that gets frequently repeated on the other sub.
A hardfork was planned and everyone was required to upgrade. The fact that many blocks after the flagday happened to be still valid with the old rules is anecdotal. It is rule sets, not chain history, what determines forks in Bitcoin.
Furthermore, there is some block in 2015 that it cannot be handled by v0.7 not even when fed without reorganizations.
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:56:53
Yes. However, this does not make the process far from ideal. I mean, it is better if there is little risk of long-range reorganizations for unupgraded nodes and SPV clients. BIP9 is basically a safety net: not strictly required, as it is users those that make BTCs valuable, but always preferable.
Also, if *de facto* "reference implementation" software  projects are capable of persuading enough users to UASF, then this can be a big risk if the project becomes compromised. More generally, UASFs can be damaging, e.g., imagine that Bitpay and Coinbase UASF* to optional 100MB-big extended blocks: In that case, smaller miners would earn much less fee revenue and get outcompeted by the big ones.

This is false, to the extent of my knolwedge. A majority of them want bigger blocks. There has not been any proposal that has gained widespread consensus **yet** (apart from segwit, which has a moderate increase), but consensus is hard.
@_date: 2016-01-21 11:03:02


As long as these implementations have different consensus rules, it would be absurd to run something different from what a majority of the miners run (or a superset, i.e., a pre-hardfork of this).
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:40:43


Yes, of course. Bitcoin can resist political attacks from one side or the other. Some people confuse the existence of a *reference implementation* (which is just a statement of the reality that it is the most widely adopted and so, if we want to ensure global consensus, it is the referent variety in consensus loss) with some sort of *officiality*. It is not! The Core team is centralized and corruptible. They have proved themselves so far, but this is no guarantee for the future.


In the outside word, it disappears. Therefore, the on-exchange IOU of that becomes irredeemable or, in other words, worthless. It is not that they have an option, though. The market could decide (I find it unlikely, but there is nothing impeding it) that BTU is the new Bitcoin and that BTC should practically die, and in that case exchanges would need to deliver the fork-referred coins of the outputs under their control.

Bitcoin itself, at the base layer, is actually a very poor payment method (blockchains have huge overheads, like having to store each and every of others' transactions). The good news is that it *enables* good payment methods at the top layers; have a look at the Lightning Network.

It does not matter if your wallet is Core or Electrum. However, it is essential that you run a full node; if you Electrum as your wallet, connect exclusively to your own Core+Electrum server.
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:23:10
Bitcoin is not immune to hardforks (e.g., the BDB lock limit bug, or maybe new functionality that cannot be done or is too inconvenient done as a softfork). In a hardfork, it is very important to know which chain has the economic majority behind (even if only to sell because Bitcoin had turned into something that you would no longer support).
You could expect centralized exchanges to do the work for you, but experience shows that they cannot be trusted. See e.g., how Coinbase' CEO openly announced that he would switch tickers at will (according to his judgment and careless about confusion that that would provoke) even if both subchains went ahead co-existing.
So, in the presence of imperfect information and active misinformation campaigns  , node count *could be* some proxy for economic majority. However, fakenodes and non-genuine nodes (e.g., "cloud") make this unusable. Actually, during the BitcoinClassic peak we experienced a very active campaign in that sense that saw Classic nodes jump above Bitcoin ones for a while.

It might be necessary in the future. Let us say that miners get regulatory captured or otherwise compromised: We will need to switch to a different hashing algorithm.
Just the open possibility that it could happen, and the credible threat that the economic majority will make it happen if needed, might already be enough to prevent its necessity from happening in the first place.

yes they do -- it is supported in the firmware and can be used via Electrum


In Bitcoin, [there is no such thing as "from" address]( Wallets and block explorers may try to decode inputs in very diverse ways; the fact that yours shows one or more "bc1 address" as inputs of transactions that paid you does not necessarily mean that the sender --Coinbase, in this case-- understands or supports the bech32 address format nor native segwit in particular.

One of the main advantages of RBF is that it permits to bump up the fee when blocks are getting full.

Sorry to say that, but I am afraid that you are not getting it at all. Bitcoin is decentralized; no dev team is *in charge* (neither now nor in the future - we would better switch to something more efficient like Ripple if this became the case **edit**: I mean, if this were hypothetically what we wanted). 
That letter is not about one development team vs. another, but about the original chain vs. a contentious takeover attempt. Core could get compromised or otherwise corrupted; they could propose a contentious hardfork tomorrow and the same logic would apply: They would need a new name for it.
You are playing an extremely dangerous game. If you reassign the ticker to a new chain when the old one is still alive (however small), you will expose your users to really severe confusion. Single digit, subdollar even, prices would not be unlikely (for both subchains) in such *extreme chaos* scenario. You do not see it, but you risk burning it all down.

Individual incentives, not collective ones, are what define the rational strategy for a miner.
That said, RBF is in my view clearly beneficial for Bitcoin:
 - It allows to bump fees, something that can be extremely useful for filtering out spam, especially now that blocks are getting full.
 - Together with the *scorched earth mechanism* it actually makes 0-conf more secure, as it disables the incentives of double spending.

Aethereum promotion is pretty much off-topic here, just like Feathercoin promotion is off-topic (I presume) on The fact that they started as hardforks of other chains is irrelevant. Actually, Mastercoin, Counterparty and Factom are just softforks (should bitcoin die and any of these succeed), yet few call them *the "true" Bitcoin*.
I do not like much to refer to BitcoinXT and BitcoinClassic as altcoins. But this is not because they start as hardforks; this is because they are very similar to Bitcoin and they present themselves as complete replacements (for mining, at least), not just *alternatives* (I think that this is Gavin's vision, at least, independently of the fact that there might be some idiots besides who think that we can have multiple incompatible chains and still have a meaningful Bitcoin system).

Cool stuff! Glad she seems to have passed the ethard phase, also.
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:49:43
They do not.
Users make transactions and decide the fee. *Individually*, miners can only accept or reject them. But if a given miner rejects them and there is still space left, a second miner would pick them. Therefore, the second miner has a marginal advantage over the first one (barring orphaning risks, which get solved, as I mention, with IBLT and SPV mining).
The only way that miners can *collectively* prevent a race to the bottom is through a majority collusion, i.e., a cartel. Alas, miners are anonymous and so there is no way to punish the cartel defectors (alternatively, if mining becomes non-anonymous, they would get regulatory capturable, in which case we would have already lost).
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:01:03
Yes. The main issue is that, when we discuss forks, the reasoning is not in what happened but in what could have happened.
Versions with BDB would have even forked themselves depending on how they saw block reorganizations. Being consensus incapable, they did not properly define a set of consensus rules (but notice that in the absence of formal verification this is still most probably the case today!).
Anyway, what matters in the end is that we have evidence of blocks that are valid now and would have not been valid back then. This is not a hardfork in all its definitions, but it is in the most commonly accepted ones.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:10:02

I think your options strongly depend on what were these reasons (I am not judging them). If you can be convincing that you just got confused filing the claim, then you may try.

@_date: 2016-06-20 19:20:47
Irrelevant? 
Then bad wording from me maybe. 
What I mean is that the miner may accept fees out of band, and this may leave a gap. But then the miner will also have standard (input-output difference) fees to fill the block, and she will, because there is free competition in mining. Therefore, there is a vanishing gap.

It is a ceiling, so there is no actual "reduce the limit". Everyone can use lower limits if they want.
The same for the 21M limit. Miners can claim less subsidy (and they had in the past).
More fundamentally, in Bitcoin there is no way to validate if the set of rules was *followed*, only if a set of *consensus constraints* was respected. It is impossible to know with certainty if miners are secretly enforcing a softfork.
Softforks are enforced, entirely, by miners. Oppositely, in hardforks miners have little to say.
Concretely, for the case of the block size, miners have less incentive in a softfork that reduces the limit, so they would not rationally accept it. Keep in mind that, for miners, the best outcome for a 51% is to get rid of the other 49% and thus share more of the pie. 
The better connected majority of miners *should rationally* desire larger block sizes. Only that, if we let them, we would end up in a Tragedy of the Commons, where fees only pay for the propagation costs and there is nothing left for hashing.
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:48:07
CSV means *check sequence verify* and it is a new instruction for Bitcoin transactions. Since it is a new mechanism, it is a new "rule" that narrows down the "set of rules" that is valid for the blockchain, i.e., a soft-fork.
This new instruction makes possible relative lock times (see BobAlison's reply). Not typically used on simple transactions, but potentially very useful in payment layers on top of them.

Maybe. It probably depends on the case. But it does not matter: If it is cheaper to get exported, it will. If not, it will be used to mine bitcoins.
Keep in mind that, ultimately, bitcoins are new value created out of nothing. Moreover, their worth translates to a proof of wasted energy (notice that this is true for whatever theory of value you choose; this is the case independently of which was the origin of their value).
So, yes, this requires "tons of energy lost", **by design**. Energy gets wasted, wealth gets created. Bitcoins are actually provably wasted joules (for any given difficulty period), but since the cost of joules (be it monetary or in terms of energy) varies from one place to another, then Bitcoin is a perfectly efficient siphoner of value from cheap places to expensive places.
@_date: 2016-06-16 19:04:01
Great news. Right now, this will essentially double the number of cheap (but otherwise economically meaningful) stuck transactions. I do not worry though: I do not think there are many of these.
This will show how many transactions are legitimate and how many are just spam (be it intentional or unintentional-but-in-practice-equivalent-to).
In the future we will need full RBF though, because it is incentive compatible (opt-in RBF is not); Bitcoin cannot work if *rational* miners get more than the *honest* ones.

You are probably right and I am wrong. However, in my view, crypto-token value needs more than just proof of spent resources. All proof-of-work coins would have some floor value if that were true, yet experience shows that they die every now and then with worthless tokens.
Bitcoin stakeholders can freely move to/from any sidechain they want, while Counterparty stakeholders are trapped in Counterparty. Yet Counterparty needs that bitcoins stay valuable to be secure. If Counterparty overtakes Bitcoin, it will need full validation of its transactions and then largely rely on fees. Not only miners will lack any incentive to such issuance reduction, but also the (Bitcoin ∪ Counterparty) system will be less valuable because of the fungibility break.


Not if a majority of miners validate them. Hashing power has been increasing exponentially for a long time and this reduces its cumulative effect. This means that the 51% attacker not only owns the future, but can also re-write rather deep in the past. 
An hybrid consensus system like proof-of-activity may be able to solve this, but we are still far from there.
My bet is that useful sidechains will get created (permissionless), then merge-mined when they gain some traction, then soon soft-forked to full validation (as extended blocks) if they are considered valuable. But maybe we get from fed-peg straight to soft-fork, if miners signal such a support.

Old nodes kept working correctly and see no overflow at any point. There is also no way to know for sure what software is being used to mine blocks (in 2010 or in 2019), and the blockchain has no evidence of an overflow. Nobody forked away.
All we have are reports of a relatively long reorg seen by people that claimed to be running an overflowable codebase, and this is it. Rational agents are expected to invalidate (even manually deleting a block, or calling invalidateblock on it, if needed) any block that creates inflation, in an entirely autonomous way and without requiring any coordination whatsoever.

So this alone is not that bad after all. But I am sure that at least the Join Market community will be operating high-degree sub-networks with onion routing, thus making Lightning transactions more private than on-chain.

This is risky unless you guarantee that you will double-spend the same inputs.

I mainly agree with you, but I think that there are more similarities than you suggest. The early 2010 Bitcoin protocol was feature rich in OP_ codes, supposed to enable smart contracts. Not Turing complete, but more like in Ethereum.
The main difference was that, in Bitcoin, the solution was a softfork. Since miners were interested in having limited supply, they naturally chose it; we cannot really talk about a *centralized solution*. In Ethereum, VB's proposed roll back is fundamentally different (even if they just do the soft-fork blacklisting).

Lightning is as an integral part of Bitcoin as the blockchain. The Bitcoin system has multiple sub-systems: the blockchain, the p2p network, and the payment channels.
Notice that there are no bitcoins in the blockchain: BTC, as a unit, is just a UX abstraction, in the same way as TBC (tonal-bitcoins).
Paying to addresses (be them pubkey- or script hashes, witnessed or not) is a terrible payment system. It does not support invoicing, recipient identification, paid status, memo or instant confirmation. Its only good is that it is non-interactive. Bitcoin needs a payment system as an integral part of it (Lightning or other).

Thanks for the answer.
I think that the use case that you describe is what you tried to achieve with the *authorized trustlines* thing, which is something different. So no, freezability of authorization-free trustlines was fully unnecessary, in my view.
More importantly, in real life, a banknote does not become invalid after the criminal who has stolen it uses it to pay for her food.
Also, you talk about legal obligations by the gateways (OK), but ignore that IOU issuance is a contract with given set of conditions, and **retroactive** freezability fundamentally altered those issuance contracts. Yes, "gateways that wanted freezing had to switch issuing accounts" is exactly what was supposed to happen in order to maintain those. Users had already paid at time of issuance, for what they believed was a fungible asset. The message you gave was that you can alter their fungibilty retroactively and arbitrarily.
Futhermore, in putting the responsibility of freezing in the hands of the issuers themselves, you opened the door to selective scamming. It is, as they say, like letting the fox guard the henhouse. You let your users (those who put real wealth in your system) exposed to the tyranny of gateways.
As I said, none of these actions has prevented gateways from exit scamming one by one. It is the *mybitcoin/bitcoinica/gox* again and again.

No. There are no *true innovators* in crypto crowd sales.
*True innovators* innovate for the most secure, strongest and worthiest blockchain. Either via a BIP or, if the idea is too much a departure from the current structure, via a sidechain.
If they instead do a crowd sale, this is a strong indicator that they are not here for the innovation but for the get-rich-quick. I am not saying that exceptions to this are impossible, but I have yet to see one.
More fundamentally, any novel real innovation will get copied at nearly zero cost and ported to Bitcoin, and it will have more sense there because it is more secure. This possibility makes ICOers concentrate their efforts in extensive marketing campaigns, to seduce the gullible, instead of innovation.

Onchain spam, for things that do not require a blockchain, is nothing to celebrate. That just implies that *dynamic blocksize* does not work, as there is excess capacity that gets abused.
Fees are low because almost nobody uses it for real transfers. If it was to reach Bitcoin's scale, it would operate significantly worse, because transactions are much bigger and validation is much slower. This is what condemns it to perpetual niche-use.
Don't get me wrong, I love the cryptonote tech, and I'd love to see ring-CT working in Bitcoin one day, but the aforementioned are important considerations.

I disagree. Privacy is not criminal *per se*. Yes, it is a strategy that *could* be used to facilitate money laundering (concealing the source of a transfer of money), but not necessarily laundering at all.


Unfortunately, they are used too little to make it matter, and their fundamental unscalability means they will likely stay in a niche forever. That way, a vast majority of transfers are from an exchange or to an exchange, and so transfers can easily get uncloaked at that point, though metadata, defeating the cryptographic chain-analysis resistance.

Well said. There will always be a practically unlimited demand for cheap unforgeable, immutable, highly deduplicated key storage. If transactions are cheap enough, people will use them for dice games, diamond registrations and botnet control; uneconomical uses that externalize their costs to every peer on the network.
These are not spam as long as they pay the fee, and there is no way to stop them in a permissionless system. However, that constitutes an uneconomical demand that works as long as bitcoins have any strictly positive value. It does not increase Bitcoin's value, and so it would not be rational to support it with larger block sizes.

Yes and no. Arbitrage is usually considered between two quantities of the same category "asset", typically between a monetary asset and a non-monetary asset.
This is more like a Carnot cycle, with the joule-cost as a temperature analogue. The expensive-place -&gt; cheap-place line in the phase diagram is always adiabatic (conserves entropy) as it relates to value. Without Bitcoin, however, the cheap-place -&gt; expensive-place cannot be adiabatic, as there is a cost to either transport the energy or cover a smaller demand. Bitcoin solves this: The cheap place can mine bitcoins instead and siphon them at no cost to the expensive place.
@_date: 2016-06-26 12:50:03


I agree. But I do not think it is possible to find the optimum. Bitcoin is a global experiment and, without a multiverse, we cannot really explore multiple settings and compare (regarding altcoins, they are not really alternative experiments, but if anything, they tend to show that in big blockchains only the "foundations" run nodes).
Halving every 4 years is probably not the ideal inflation either. But this is it.
Personally, for me 1MB is probably a bit too much (but OK, I do not *depend* on Bitcoin). If one day I have to stop my full node, I will probably sell my coins as well (or I may just bury a paper wallet and stop using Bitcoin) anyway I will not use SPV. I have put too much effort in coinjoining and obfuscating my transactions in the past, to suddenly consider giving up my financial privacy.

I am certain that we are definitely "collaborating" if anything :)
I quoted a relevant paragraph from the article, but please click on the link and have a look at it. Paul Sztorc argues that "the cost of running a full node" is a good measure of *decentralization* in the system.
Bitcoin's worth comes mainly from being a honey badger, i.e., trustless, permissionless, censorship resistant, and these qualities are strongly correlated with *decentralization*. Therefore, he argues, having low-cost full nodes (peers in the system) maximizes its value.
Personally, I agree pretty much with that view. If I wanted to use a client-server system, if I need to trust that a collection of servers are not colluding, then I would be better using Ripple or OpenTransactions or Bitshares, or something else that is more "efficient" than Bitcoin.

Actual activation happens in 2016-block windows. In the current one, so far, 95% of the blocks indicated readiness.

What do you think is the issue though? A majority of the hashrate is being continuously monitored by large-scale operators. Massive synchronous hacking would be immediately detected and mitigated.
Even then, after the Antbleed and the covert Asicboost incidents, a lot of miners run custom firmware (open sourced), or at very least they run on hardened non-public environments.
With all that in mind, it seems very unlikely that an attacker could gain control of more than 51%, but even if they did, effects would be almost certainly short-lived and nobody would lose coins.

We probably agree that something like Rootstock or Counterparty will become the *new Bitcoin* one day in the future.
My problem with Counterparty's tokens is that they were created at a singular event with no new issuance/redemption mechanism. They are valuable, of course, because they are backed by the bitcoins burnt, but they will difficultly outperform these (Counterparty can be duplicated at little cost if there is enough demand and XCP trades too high). I think that this is a key point: Bitcoins are collectively (and subjectively) perceived as valuable because, years after creation, blocks were still giving 50 BTC and there will be **fair new issuance** practically forever.
Counterparty could become the new Bitcoin through a soft fork that requires valid Counterparty blocks (thus upgrading from proof-of-publication to the *incentive compatible* full validation), but miners will never do that, as they are incentivized to issue as much as possible (e.g., they could soft-fork to 24-bitcoin subsidy, but they will not).
On the other hand, Rootstock looks more sensible. It may be worse during the centralized phase, but ultimately it may reach full validation by nearly all miners. Then, and thanks to the two-way pegging, a soft-fork to full validation will retain main-chain's incentive compatibility. Of course, if they do not get rid of that stupid "foundation fee" they will be copied at nearly zero cost.

Their main business is selling bitcoins to the public, much more than buying them. They would, in principle, have a big incentive if they could cut costs and sold unbacked coins, and nobody would notice until everyone withdrew. Experience indicates that most *Con*base users store their coins there, so that might go undetected for a very long time, maybe indefinitely.
Anyway, that is not the point. I am not even claiming that that happens, just that that is not imposible. **The 21M guarantee applies only on coins whose keys are under your control; there is no mathematical guarantee for claimed balances on "bit-banks" and other custodial services**.

No, not at all. That is a deterministic peg, independent of backings and systems. For all practical purposes, Liquid-coins are bitcoins, as "bitcoin" is an abstract representatioLin of value (and there are not really bitcoins either on the main chain) anyway.
Of course, the DMMS (main chain) is more robust, safer and fairer than the Liquid federation of block signers,  but it can be expected to work reasonably well enough, at least for use with centralized "bitbank" exchanges, where you are already trusting some service with your coins.

You retroactively destroyed the fungibility of assets, altering their conditions **after issuance** and opening them to arbitrary freezability (as if real-life IOUs were freezable by the issuer, instead of the secondary market).
And then, you forced users of your open-source software under KYC procedures (I question why you still call this a "public" blockchain after that). In a similar way, you switched from *opened* to *closed* the ripple-bitcoin bridge.
The former was just evil, probably not full retard, but the latter is quite close to Swanson-style.

Payer identity.
It is advertised as "optional" only. However, if BIP75 sees great success and is implemented by most major wallets, then the "heavily regulated payment processors" may start requiring that buyers specify their identity.
They (the proponents) now say that this could be just an ephemeral virtual identity, but it is easier to see that once in practice, there is nothing stopping Coinbase from requiring that such identity is verified through KYC procedures.
Even if optional, this is very dangerous. It would break fungibility, as it would force law abiding users through KYC so that they can ensure that they will be able to spend their bitcoins. This mean more surveillance from the state, more risk of identity theft and ultimately Bitcoin losing its main appeal.

I fully agree with you. What I mean is that we need to assume that full RBF, selfish mining, etc. is **how the system works by design**, because Bitcoin can only prevail if miners maximize their profits.
The key point of Nakamoto's consensus is why is it reasonable to assume that there will not be more than 49% faulty signers (miners, weighted by hashing power). This is only the case if the non-faulty (=honest) are maximizing their profits, i.e., taking the most of the incentive. 
If we define *honest behavior* in Bitcoin as enforcing 0-conf (or self-limiting the block size), then this is what I meant that *cannot work*. 
RBF miners would get more than non-RBF ones and so the former would take over. If users are relying on 0-conf, they risk getting suddenly burned. This is why we need that the reference implementation at least is incentive compatible, and educate users on what behavior they can expect to last.

Just that, instead of physically exchange them, we will publicly announce the transactions to everyone else, and everyone will keep a list of the transactions to keep track of who owns what. Also, transactions are signed by the owner of the sticker. We all agree that a transaction is valid if it is unique and if its signature is valid. This is Bitcoin.
Now, there are many possible ways of grouping the transactions. The *old way* is just putting them together along their signatures, in a single long list. In place of the list, we can then keep a mnemonic of it and refer to it. If someone tries to modify the list (to alter a transaction), the mnemonic will change and so we will be able to prove that the altered list is invalid.
This is cool, but the *new way*, SegWit, is even smarter: We put the transactions in a list and the signatures in another list right next. This way, because we have already validated the signatures, we can forget about them, and so the list has more space for the transactions. Also, now the mnemonic does not cover the signatures, so if someone alters a transaction with a signature that is different but still valid, the mnemonic does not change.
In the Lightning Network, with SegWit, we can transact with only references to mnemonics, without actual need for the list. It is impossible to cheat because it will be evident by looking at the list, so no one does it.

All worthless hearsay. Transactions that big are relatively frequent (several per month) and, when it is indeed a whale and not a new or unidentified exchange or service, it trades OTC outside of the orderbooks, with no direct chance to make them fall. Even then, bitcoin's daily volume is around 1M, so the relative effect would be limited even if droped on the public market.

Miners can mine anonymously or false flag even. For all we know, Bitundo may have been very significant in hashing power. Also, Bitpay and Coinbase will not tell you how many double spendings they have silently eaten up. Notice that a majority of merchants have stopped accepting 0-conf in the last year.
Also, mining is very competitive. Miners burn tons of resources and losers get out of the "iterative" game quite quickly.
Finally, notice that my point is not based on hypothetical considerations, but experience observed in the past. We have already seen Tragedy-of-the-Commons behavior in Bitcoin mining: E.g., miners used to accept 0-fee transactions that met certain "priority" conditions, but this is no longer the case as they lack individual incentive. Or SPV mining, where a non-validating free rider has an advantage over their peers as long as they do validate.

About those other options, I recommend that you avoid centralized exchanges. Any of them will almost certainly fuck you sooner or later.
Try Bitsquare: It is an exchange that is peer-to-peer, just like Bitcoin itself, and so there is no central party controlling anything, just regular users exchanging with each other. The USD orderbook is still quite quiet, unfortunately, but this also implies that, if you can wait, you can provide liquidity and get several % better than the market.

Notice also that there is still considerable risk with softforks. 
Miner's readiness signaling could be feigned; right after activation, miners that reject a newly invalid block do so at considerable risk (whoa what just happened? did the soft-fork failed to activate? should I build on top and risk getting orphaned? or should I build on parallel and risk being left behind?). The *ex ante* rules were previously universally agreed and so act as a Schelling point.
Also, defining the meanings of versionbits requires not only system-wide coordination but also some degree of centralization (e.g., imagine that Bitcoin goes to the Moon and adopted by governments; it happens so fast that we fail to implement ConfidentialTransactions in time before an international treaty bans them; how do we do it? sourceforge, github et al. will not allow even discussing the possibility).
In the future, softforks will no longer be an option. Especially, if it reaches near trillion size, it will become very delicate to change anything. Then, most innovation will have to come in a permissionless way through sidechains or similar.

@_date: 2016-06-28 19:25:56
Sadly, yes.
If miners start doing blacklisting today, when we are still at a grey area, it will not be hard to agree to fork them out of the network by means of a change in the hashing algorithm. And then do again the GPU-&gt;ASIC transition, with new players who had learned the lesson.
However, there is a point in the adoption curve where this is no longer possible, I believe. In particular, coordinating a hard fork may prove very difficult once governments are already involved. Also, the subsequent GPU-&gt;ASIC transition is risky, because there are just a handful of manufacturers, susceptible to regulatory capture.
So in the end, if we reach full adoption when at a state where non-private transactions are in use, governments may impose a ban on *confidential* ones. It is easy to do: E.g., prevent financial institutions from accepting CT; a black market would appear, sure, but the fungibility break would make miners and the majority of law-abiding hodlers use transparent transactions only.
We need to roll out CT and then make them mandatory (or at least move most of the coins there) before it is too late. Before fiat becomes irrelevant and exchanges are no longer needed.
That said, I truly hope that you are right and that I am just being too much pessimistic.

For most practical purposes, the miners are the ones building the blocks. Pooled mining is p2pool and GBT.

No, they do not. Given a generator curve, a private key results in only one public key. 
This can be expressed in two forms, compressed or uncompressed, but they are the same.
Now, can two private keys have the same public key? (a different question!) I do not know all the details, but to me it looks like it should not be impossible. We are using elliptic curves over a finite field, which define a finite cyclic group with some congruence modulo. 
I ignore if there is an additional detail that prevents it, but in principle it looks like the solution to the discrete logarithm could be multivaluate, i.e., two private keys could lead to the same public key.
Finally, what happens? Nothing. private-to-public is a trapdoor operation. It is infeasible in practice to find even one of the solutions. Also, an attacker that could break a public key, just one of the private keys is enough for forging a valid signature, even if the original user used another key.

No, they did not. Most of the low-fee transactions are either uneconomical uses (dice games, factoms, botnet instructions and other shit) or transactions of little economic relevance (faucets, splitted multi-payments, etc.). There is probably a money-draining spam attack too. 
These do not make sense at higher fees and they would go (partially at least) without affecting genuine usage (who would still pay pennies, only a few more).
Transactions are data that will be validated and fully deduplicated by anyone and forever. Thus it makes sense that they are market-priced by the nodes.
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:29:25
No, not an actual "roll back". The offending transaction was orphaned by miners. There was a discrepancy between the whitepaper and the reference implementation, and miners collectively chose the most restrictive interpretation, i.e., the one that *the sum of outputs cannot be more than 50btc larger than the sum of inputs*.
The OP_ codes that allowed that were then disabled in a softfork, yes, but this was not different from [BIP42]( No contention, no blacklisting, no rolling back.
In Bitcoin, you have no guarantee that your transaction will be included in the blockchain or that it will stay there in case of a reorganization.

Full RBF is not a consensus rule. Miners can implement it individually.
Collective incentives may be *do not break usability*, but there is no cartel behavior possible in a permissionless system and so it ends up as a Tragedy of the Commons. In other words, only individual incentives (not collective ones) can work in Bitcoin.
Now fees are still insignificant compared to the block subsidy, but this will not last. Like it or not, full RBF (along with selfish mining and withholding attacks at pools) will happen sooner or later.
We better get prepared now than get suddenly caught off guard at some time in the future. Bitcoin can only ultimately survive if it stays robust and incentive compatible.

Yes. In Bitcoin, POW has two functions: as a hashcash, and to secure the transactions. The issue is with the latter aspect, i.e., with the blockchain structure more than with the POW.
To some degree, even 10-miniute blocks and blocksize limits are not enough and do not stop the centralization pressure.

The semantics is relevant here. If you think that that is about Core vs. NYA-working-group, then yes, both are centralized, corruptible groups and you can choose your poison. And by the way, the ETH Foundation is much better funded and competent, and can easily take over (if centrally controlled tokens were any valuable).
But no. I do think that Bitcoin is valuable because of Core. It is valuable because it is truly decentralized, because it cannot be "governed" or "steered". 
Because of that, I am quite certain that, in November, the *Bitcoin* blockchain will go on as usual and the 2x corporatocratic takeover attempt will miserably fail (as have all the others before it). If I am wrong and holders back the 2x altcoin over Bitcoin, that would mean that Bitcoin is not what it is supposed to be but an uninteresting, centralized token.

I see I probably made a poor choice of words, sorry.
The blockchain will go on anyway, of course, with miners doing whatever individually maximizes their profits. Honest nodes will thus, in Nakamoto consensus terms, be the non-faulty ones, i.e., the ones maximizing their profits.
When I said that *Bitcoin cannot work if rational miners get more than the honest ones*, what I meant was that if our idea of "Bitcoin" includes 0-conf, self-limiting block sizes or other *irrational* or *incentive incompatible* aspects, then **this idea of Bitcoin cannot work** as it will not be robust and users may one day suddenly start seeing unanticipated behaviors.
It is not reasonable to expect that the 51% will always follow an arbitrary "honest" behavior if there are no individual incentives for that.
Notice that the implications of this conclusion are profound and, taken to the extreme, they imply that e.g., fungibility-breaking schemes (like colored coins) cannot work.

No, not necessarily. This presupposes an economy where there is only one currency (which makes me think that you are probably a user of a major currency, probably the American dollar, am I right?), and that earnings are majorly destined to paying those bills.


Principally, anywhere where fiat money is not good e.g., Wikileaks and the many categories of [Operation Choke Point]( as well as regular people and regular business in areas that suffer international or domestic economic sanctions.

Easily changeable? In the software, sure, but not in the protocol. Bitcoin Core implements the Bitcoin protocol. You change a consensus parameter and you can get out of sync with the others.
BitcoinEXTREME is an altcoin (alternative chain with alternative rules) that could one day replace Bitcoin (as could BU) if people become foolish enough. If you are mining with it, you can adjust all the parameters as you wish; as a node it will just accept anything (unlike Core or Unlimited), and hope that the invisible hand will organically find the optimal ones.
As far as I am aware, the current proposal will just check the difficulty and verify the transactions of blocks. However, as I mentioned in the grandparent, it could eventually even get rid of the blockchain and the transaction structure rigidity, as the free market is capable of finding the correct state of the ledger by its own mechanisms, which we should not be dictating or restricting in any way.

Because things work well until they do not. Nonfull blocks are not incentive compatible.
For a long time, fees have been insignificant vs. the block subsidy and miners have not cared. As mining becomes more and more competitive, and the subsidy halves, we cannot expect this to last.
For small enough fees, [demand becomes practically unlimited](

Mmm... do you know how futures work? All the alts markets (ETHUSD is the only exception) are traditional futures, with end-of-quarter maturity. As such, they are affected by  , which is more visible in the beginning of the period, like it is the case right now. Contango can vary, but it typically tends to average a rate of 0.02% daily, which implies that, right now, midrange price would trade 1.6% higher than the index. 
It is quite consistent and you can count on that for your tradings.

Your situation is fully analogous to having a 1-of-1 wallet in your phone and then resetting it. In my view, your only option would be to root the phone, make a disk image and try to recover the 2FA seed from it.

Those transactions are probably i) central tumblers, ii) OP_RETURN shit and iii) long back-and-forth payments. In all of those cases, they are being extremely inefficient in their use of blockchain space, for which they provide little economic value to the network.
Efficient alternatives for i) are tumblebit, shufflepuff, joinmarket, for ii) opentimestamps, and for iii) *transaction cut-through* or vanilla payment channels.

No. There is no deterministic relationship. E.g., block sizes have been quite stable for the last year, yet the size of the UTXO set has continued to increase. Also, in the absence of a discount for the signatures, the incentives are to make it grow (even at constant number of users).

LN is permissionless. Anyone can run a hub. And it is a network, so you will be able to reach anyone else, permissioned or not. KYC hubs will not appear, because if they did, they could be circumvented at nearly no cost.

No, I do not think so. There might be laws that require full-reserve for Bitcoin (like NY's Bitlicense), but it is still mostly unregulated.

I for one -as a user too- prefer that miners move to purely incentive compatible behavior as soon as possible (that means full-RBF, bitundo services, selfish mining and block withholding on competitors). Only then we will be able to see which practices are truly safe and which are snake oil; this is the classic Peter Todd argument.
Additionally, for RBF there is another advantage: Contrary to popular belief, it actually makes 0-conf safe by removing the double-spend incentive by means of the *scorched earth* mechanism. Today, accepting 0-conf demands that the payee does an extensive Sybil attack on the network to detect what mining nodes actually see first; with RBF, the payee has typically several minutes of margin for noticing a double spending and launching scorched earth.

Indeed, even in the misleadingness: Segwit2x does NOT increase any "base size limit" to 2MB. There is only one limit, the weight limit, which it increases to 8MB.

As I said, there is no "core chain". This is not Core vs. BTC1, nor coredevs vs. NYA proponents. Even if Core merged the 2x hardfork change, it would then follow an altcoin, not Bitcoin.
This is because Bitcoin is a decentralized set of rules. There is no one in charge. If you hardfork to a different, incompatible set of rules, then you are in an altcoin, not Bitcoin. 
By virtue of definition, we can make the 2x coin (chain) become Bitcoin ('s blockchain), but only if practically everyone upgrades.

I do not think that there is a genuine need for microtransactions right now. Lightning still arguably needs some development, but Teechan is pretty much ready (it is much simpler) and it does not need any softfork. If the supposed urgency of more capacity were real, people would be deploying it already.
The reality is that you cannot buy coffee with Bitcoin nearly anywhere. Should demand explode, we could immediately deploy a solution (I am quite confident that Hyperbitcoinization will happen, just not next month).

This is quite risky. Exponential growth cannot go on indefinitely. In the history of the biosphere, the periods of exponential growth have been rare and relatively short. The industrial revolution has made possible quasi-exponential growth (in population and resources) for nearly 150 years, but there is no reason to believe (other than irrational techno-optimism) that we can have it for 150 years more (and even if we are eventually able to reach the level of Dyson spheres, there is no guarantee that it would be linearly from today, without one or many catastrophes taking place before).
In the end, it is not a disaster because we can soft-fork to tighter limits. 
And other than that, there is some merit in permanently respecting the original 32MB limit that was effectively in place since the first release. By the time when we reach it, we would have probably had enough time to get ready solutions with better scalability than the blockchain.

This is problematic because you bought the gox-bitcoins from another trader who got your gox-dollars and is also claiming them.
Maybe you could try to argue that you do not recognize the last balance and that there might have been an unauthorized access to your account (hacker could not withdraw anyway), and that that is why you claimed the USD instead.

At this point, we see only the individual effect of the witness discount, which means that fees for a typical transaction for segwit are about half of those of a legacy transaction.
Supply is perfectly inelastic, though. As segwit adoption increases, and as block sizes increase, we will notice the collective effects, where the extra capacity will bring fees down much more significantly (and for both segwit and legacy transactions).

The strenght of 2-of-3 is that you can afford leaking one of the seeds and it would not be catastrophic. Same if you accidentally lose one. 
I would recommend that you use different operating systems and do not share any software, accounts or data between your devices, especially the two PCs desktop and laptop. This way, their are unlikley to get the same malware at once in two of them, so you avoid generalistic attacks and are only subject to less likely targeted attacks.


Generally unsafe, but it strongly depends on how many coins, how strong encryption, and for how long.


Yes, please do that if you take that route.


They will eventually get cracked. I would not in any case rely on the access-control password used by Electrum, but add additional file encryption. It might be safe enough for a very short period of time if you also use a strong passphrase, but then, in that case, it might be simpler that you try to memorize directly your seed instead of the strong passhprase.

@_date: 2016-06-20 14:50:45
No, because not everyone pays the same fee.
Transactors make their bidding and **then** miners pick up transactions and build blocks. Transactors differ in risk taking and inclusion priority; so fee bidding will never be homogeneous.
There is an ever increasing demand at asymptotically null fees, so miners have no reason not to exhaust the quota.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:04:38


No. "It is also empirically known that they were sold for dollars before ever being used as a medium of exchange", so according to the regression theorem, they had to have some intrinsic value, even if it seems quite undefined. Now they are already proved valuable; they do not become more valuable because they are used more, rather they are used more because they become more valuable. Read also the last paragraph of that article which contains [the parable of the futurist]( as a possible explanation.


Precisely, because "money is a shared hallucination [so] you can’t replicate Bitcoin’s value by replicating the technology. You would have to also replicate the hallucination, which you can’t." 
Indeed, some of them are already a little bit better than Bitcoin, but thanks God not significantly better as to justify a collective switching. Decentralized payments are cryptocurrency's *killer app* and by far the best *smart contract* (and maybe even the only one that really makes practical sense). But if some new feature appears someday that is proved truly valuable, it will be replicated on Bitcoin. You can do that in a fully permissionless way; have a look at Rootstock.

Personally, I might be able to handle 10x capacity, by cutting bandwidth (i.e., going freerider mode) and pruning. However, I could not handle 10x UTXO. Maybe with some yet-to-be-seen optimizations and massive caching, I would be able to still verify the blockchain, but for small miners (who need UTXO in RAM to stay competitive) it would be *game over*.

The blockchain is necessarily slow, because you need to sync everyone on the planet (even through tor or sat links). For this, the interblock target interval cannot be much smaller than 10' (and since block discovery is a Bernouilli process, this guarantees that as much as half of the blocks will be spaced less than 7' apart). You also need multiple confirmations to be safe, so this makes it even longer.
There is no solution for this (at least, not if you still want a decentralized system; a federated chain can surely be much faster). Sadly, changing the blockchain with a blocktree (Ghost) is not incentive compatible, and emptying blocks (Bitcoin-NG) cannot guarantee fee revenue.
Fortunately enough, we can still safe instant transactions by means of 2nd layers, like Teechan or Lightning. We just need to stop trying to force blockchains to do something beyond their capabilities.

I think that the point is that money gets better transported than energy. Of course it would not be the same amount of energy, but this does not matter.
The simplest reduced model, there are basically two guys: cheap producer (typically in a remote location) and the expensive producer (in a high demand area).
Energy is hard to transport, so this is why the expensive producer guy exists. However, he needs big capital. Complementarily, the cheap producer guy needs consumers (without them, he gets underpaid, cannot invest in his plants and ultimately ends up discarding free, mostly green energy).
Bitcoin enters the scene: The cheap producer in an Icelandic volcano can now mine bitcoins, which pay better. This freshly created wealth in the World can now pay the expensive producer for energy in the metropolitan area. 
Finally, consider *energy* as a proxy for all the other goods.
This is like a Carnot cycle. Bitcoin provides the *adiabatic* branch of value/energy transfered from remote-&gt;city which was impossible without it.

I think that it could work even at low credibility. Miners would lose everything, so for them it is an existential threat, and so it would be foolish to assume that all users are just bluffing.
On the other hand, even a small split would be quite value damaging (by Metcalfe's law, losing 25% of the economic supporters would decrease the network value by 43%). In some cases, it might be enough deterrent.
Proof-of-stake votes are rather useless, as they do not have any binding commitment attached.

Well, if the signaling is honest, the odds for a *minority activation* [are practically insignificant in our lifetime]( Early activation could significantly probably happen at less than two thirds of support, though, but a 66-34 blockchain split is not categorically different than a 75-25 and both are similarly catastrophic.
As I understand it, the main issue with the BIP109 activation mechanism is because there is no way to detect fake signaling (e.g., notbitcoinclassic, or simply switching back). If signaling is unreliable, and ending with two incompatible coexisting chains is the worst possible outcome, then this brinkmanship actually makes that switching to notbitcoinclassic is the rational choice: If there is a collective perception that BIP109 could pass (with not insignificant probability), the rational thing is to early activate it and derail it.
This is an argument against any contentious hardfork that is probably stronger than the appealing to ideological positionings (social contract, voluntarism, original vision, etc.).

I can definitely see a couple of inverted S-H-S patterns there :)
Now seriously: Just with the aspect it is hard to tell. You could also say that BIP66 was clearly stagnant from the last week of April to the end of May. Segwit's current stagnation period is probably a bit longer, but still on the same order of magnitude.
Notice also that BIP66 solved a critical vulnerability that was not publicly disclosed at that time, but was probably known by the major actors. In that sense, for something that is just "new features", like SegWit, activation would naturally take longer, even on the absence of political opposition.

Core is the node software; it does not have blocks. The Bitcoin blockchain will probably move faster than the 2x blockchain, because the vast majority of miners will follow the money.
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:55:33
Yes, I think so. Short term: BTC would increase on finex and the other tethered exchanges (binance, okex, etc.), and it would decrease on the others (kraken, coinbase, bitstamp); it is hard to tell which of these effects would be stronger, but it is likely that some "sells" would go to dai or bitusd, which would not erode the BTCUSD bid side.
Long term: The myth of *stablecoins* would take a big hit, which would reinforce the concept of Bitcoin as a money, more than a speculative asset.
@_date: 2017-01-29 22:28:07


I might more or less agree with that definition, but I think that it has a problem: A softfork could be beneficial only for an economic minority -a *niche*, if you want- and so largely ignored by the wider community, yet if would make sense that miners enforce it (as it would make bitcoins marginally more valuable). An example of that could be sidechains: A very beneficial sidechain could get full-validation upgrade by means of a softfork (so miners fully validate both chains), yet mainnet-only nodes would not need to enforce it.
For what we know, a vast majority of miners run configured/customized versions of Core, often with a patchset. Depending on how they do it, they could be already running (inadvertently or intentionally) what you define as a "51% attack" in a way that would be extremely hard (i.e., practically impossible) to detect.

Nobody decides! This is the power of a decentralized system.
You can argue that maybe we should steer Bitcoin now and make policies, because we are still far from the point where a fee market is ultimately required. But the risk is that Bitcoin keeps permanently under political control (e.g., miners set the rules, or full nodes are so expensive that you need a datacenter to run one).
Remember that The Bitcoin Foundation stopped being relevant because it became economically asphyxiated, not because they reached the conclusion that the best for Bitcoin was to dissolve.
Finally, *the market* can tell how valuable Bitcoin is, but it cannot properly make decisions. In particular, I do not see how could Bitcoin collapse and another cryptocurrency overtake its position: If Bitcoin collapses it would become clear that "magic internet monies" cannot safely store any value and the whole cryptocurrency idea is doomed. I think that people would simply go back to centralized stuff like Ripple, Ven and Linden dollars.

Well, it is a dynamic *multi-party* signature system, but there is an absorbing state where these multiple parties converge to one.

Well, nobody is forced to stay in Bitcoin, of course. A big majority can "move on" to something else, some altcoin.
In my view, as long as there are at least two people who stay with the old system and transact with each other, the old system should be called Bitcoin and the new altcoin would need to find a new name. If the old system dies completely, we could probably call, by virtue of definition, still call it *Bitcoin* (though this does not change the fact that it is a new altcoin, not the original one). The reason for this is that Bitcoin is a currency defined by a universally accepted set of rules (negatively, that is, they are constraints) of which the genesis block is only one of them. 
This is my opinion; it is however quite similar to the definitions used in BIP2, so I would assume that it is a rather popular one, or a useful one at least.
With that said, I insist: Nobody is in charge of Bitcoin and this is why it is decentralized. If a centralized team (be it Core or Unlimited or whatever) were able to force an upgrade **or a split**, then Bitcoin would not be decentralized.

For the usual Bitcoin use what you are looking for is *multisig*.


They only work if your computer is not compromised, which defeats their purpose. To safely use them, you are supposed to cross-check the address that you want to pay to with a second device, and at this point it is just cheaper, simpler and safer to multisig between the two instead.
I agree that they are *cool devices*, but there is a cargo cult around them. The use case in which they are indeed useful is when you have a list of trusted pre-approved payees inside the hardware wallet and then you use it to sign payment requests from these (instead of sending to addresses). For the usual "pay to address" use they offer marginal protection (attacker steals the payment amount instead of the entire wallet) over single-sig wallets, and less than with multi-sig.

There is no such thing as block signaling for hardforks. Block signaling is a safety mechanism for softforks, as a way to collectively choose a date for economically enforcing them.

Let them fork away then. But it will not happen. 
You first make a coin valuable and then hashers flock in, not the other way around.

We know, fundamentally, that limited, closed systems cannot sustain exponential growth for long periods of time, because they soon exhaust their capacity.
Someone could counter-argue that Mankind has indeed observed nearly exponential growth with ever-increasing resource discovery for the last three half centuries. One could thus try to generalize from this and see it as "a new normal" by means of some sort of *historiologic cosmological principle*.
However, when looking at a wider scale, History, Prehistory and, ultimately, as I mentioned, the evolutionary history of life in our planet, confirm that exponential-growth periods are indeed rare.
@_date: 2016-11-08 09:28:48
Well, miners are still free to prioritize as they wish.
The reality is that, while it could make sense *collectively* to prefer priority over raw profit, *individually* each miner wants just to maximize her profits.
Notice also that when that priority policy was the default behavior, it was not just the amount that was considered, but also the age. That train of transactions would still be low-priority.
@_date: 2016-12-09 11:33:52
Sure. What I mean is that, from my perspective, fees can still grow multiple orders of magnitude before they become a problem. My *total cost of bitcoining* would still be dominated by the node cost. Therefore, I see no immediate urgency (potentially value damaging) in lowering the fees, especially if this implies a much larger cost of node.


Actually both. If we require to have a steering committee in charge of adjusting any of those costs (by raising blocksizes or limiting fees) we are back to the Fed model.

And then unsafe assumptions about what is standard and what is not will make you lose money. Assume that an unconfirmed transaction is only "undone" once its inputs have been double spent and confirmed ; anything less than that is snake oil, in an adversarial environment.

@_date: 2017-01-30 14:25:10
Have a look at the incentives: If there are exactly zero economic nodes enforcing a softfork then, yes, I agree, a miner could try to drop it without major consequences (depending on how it was put in place, that could even be the only rational behavior: e.g., if it was some sort of tacitly agreed rule, then the fact that a new block drops it would be seen as a signal that makes others drop it too).
But if there is an economic minority enforcing it, then the incentives are different and miners would not rationally drop the softfork. Imagine that you are a miner and that there is a rule enforced by 15% of economic nodes. Which block do you try to build, one that is accepted by 85% or one that is accepted by 100%?
In few cases it would make sense to ignore the 15%, e.g., if their softfork were to accept blocks with just 10BTC subsidy (in lieu of 12.5BTC) or if they heavily restricted the maximum block size (like 100kB instead of 1MB), but generally, all other things equal, miners would go on pleasing the economic minority thus making their produce slightly more valuable.

Mining in Bitcoin is ephemeral. Some pools can try to establish a brand for themselves and then maintain a more or less stable policy, while they attempt to control a significant enough hashrate share. However, this does not mean that they are in charge of anything. Miners that do not maximize their profits will get quickly outcompeted by those that do.
A majority of the hashrate can switch to an altcoin, if they want; this does not make it Bitcoin. If the vast majority of miners want to commit a mass suicide, well, it will be interesting to watch but, as I said, I sincerely doubt it. 
If this view is "wishful thinking", if I am wrong and markets back the coin that works on proof-of-closed-door, then that is OK, but it would evidence that Bitcoin is an uninteresting, centralized, corruptible project.

In my transactions yesterday, I was getting next block confirmation with fees of 20k satoshis per kB (~3c per typical transaction). If that is 5% of the amount, maybe you could try to pay your son a bit more :).
In my view, your issue is more with Mycelium than with the Bitcoin protocol. You can easily avoid stuck transactions with *replace by fee* (works great in Electrum and I heard it is also present in Greenaddress). Maybe you should try again with one of these.

You are right: Bitcoins will not get any less *frangible* with segwit.
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:54:20


Yes. However, there is nearly unlimited demand as fees go smaller (e.g., because we decide to increase the capacity). In the end, it is a trade off, and I prefer an *expensive* Bitcoin to one that *no longer works* (e.g., because only big, identifiable actors can afford a full node and then these get regulatory captured).
I hope that one day we will be in a situation where we need larger block sizes than what segwit offers. Realistically, however, we are still far from full capacity today. We have evidences that there are much less than .1MB/min worth of *economically significant* transactions. A big chunk are long chains (spam or not, definitely a far-from-optimal use of a limited resource), small amount (changetip or other centralized options may be good enough for these), obvious non-economic uses (e.g., factoms, counterparites and other piggybacking), lotteries, arbitrage between exchanges (they can use sidechains or channels for these), tainted-coin tumbling (use coinjoin; we need better solutions) and people sending to themselves.
You are right that there is no precise definition of what constitutes an "appropriate fee". That said, it looks quite clear to me that Bitcoin could get rid of most of these economically insignificant transactions (and even those of little economic significance) without losing its value.

Just like non-Counterparty nodes cannot validate Counterparty transactions. Only those obsessed with other people's money would care about that.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:25:12
Bitcoin transactions are actually quite bad for payments. It is not only the fees. They have awful consumer protection (where Paypal excels); they are good only to (marginally) reduce taxman oversight. Also, Bitpay's rate is usually significantly worse than at exchanges, what constitutes a hidden fee. Bitcoin cards have the same problem. It is usually much better to exchange at a proper exchange, then withdraw to a traditional prepaid card (e.g., Moneypolo or Capitalist).
A healthy adoption that helps rebase the coins is getting paid in Bitcoin, for instance. This has a positive effect even if done in the "fake" Bitwage way.
@_date: 2017-01-29 13:54:36
Bitcoin does not work like that. In Bitcoin, the set of consensus rules are *negative* rules: You can never validate how blocks are built, only if rules were respected.
This implies that miners can use more restrictive rules, and enforce them (soft fork), but this could happen even secretly (more than that: In general, it is impossible to prove whether miners are enforcing a secret softfork or not). Bitcoin does not have any official upgrade bulletin/channel nor it has ever had one (despite what The Bitcoin Foundation wanted to make people believe). BIP9 is just a safety net; it does not represent any implied officialism/legitimacy. 
There is a reason v0.10 nodes can still validate the blockchain. If upgrades are ever forced, the decentralization of Bitcoin is lost (hardforking may still be better than doing nothing in some situations, but this does not change the fact that it means that we all *collectively* let the current Bitcoin die and found a new one with different rules).
I am not a fan at all of thebitcoin.foundation client, but equating it to SPV would be, IMHO, far from accurate.

Well, that is the point! Miners could have already been **secretly** enforcing some obscure soft fork, and all we would see is an occasional orphaned block by a minor pool that is still not aware of it.
Signaling has nothing to do with consensus changes, other than providing some sort of Schelling point on when and how activate them. Other ways are possible.
In the hypothetical segwit-blocking case, once the 51% (or 94% or whatever) becomes the new 100%, segwit will then activate for non-mining nodes too (with unpatched 0.13.1) and users will be able to use segwit safely.

Absurd. Tell me where in the blockchain are contained those bitcoins you say. Nowhere!
Bitcoin transactions consist of a set of proofs that contain the unlock conditions for previously unspent outputs, and a set of newly created outputs. There is a weighting for both sets, and it is required that it cannot be larger for the inputs than for the outputs (the difference, if any, is the so called *fee*). However, bitcoins, as a unit, are not there, they are just an UX abstraction. You are free to use the blockchain with bitcoin units, with *tonal bitcoin* units or with any other multiple or unit system of your liking.
So *bitcoins locked by proof of knowledge of a private key* or *bitcoins locked in 2-of-3 multisig contract* are exactly the same type of currency as *bitcoins in the LN* or *bitcoins on a sidechain*, and not only the units, I truly mean **conceptually the same**.

The LN is a network of bidirectional channels. In principle, any topology is possible. Consider a trivial case that is not only hubless but also non-hierarchical: a ring of channels; it would certainly not be very practical, but it would work.
Of course, we will not know it until we have the network fully developed, but I do not think that there would be any hubs formed (to be clear, I mean *hubs* as in the hub-and-spoke model, where the degree distribution has a particular scale that shows what is a hub and what are the spokes). The main reasons for this are: 
 - LN channels are suitable for hotwallet coins, but impractical for cold wallets. Even if using HSMs, this puts a limit in the number and size of channels that can have a node.
 - Channels will naturally emerge from a node's most typical payers and payees. This forms a preferential attachment for channels, and it is clearly decentralized.
 - The most efficient LN topology (substrate) will reflect the actual payment network. This is diverse and scale-free.
 - While today there are big payment processors, and it is thus expectable that many channels will be with Coinbase and Bitpay, there would be an incentive for channels that bypass Coinbase and Bitpay (at least for transactions that do not end at Coinbase or at Bitpay).
 - In recent years, Bitcoin's growth has been primarily fueled by internet purchases. I think that a major cause of this is that taxmen began to closely track cashing out at exchanges, so users (mainly, early adopters) have moved to use Bitpay merchants, prepaid cards, SEPA bridges, etc. However, what is growing faster now are remittances, wages and micro-jobs. In consequence, we will see more dual roles that will naturally re-balance channels. 
 - Even if in the end a majority of users just establish a single channel with their exchange, what really matters is the set of power users that will have multiple channels. The LN will probably benefit everyone, but more principally the heavy users than the speculators. Even if the latter end up organizing around hubs, the former will most probably not.

Your idea of Bitcoin seems much different from mine. Block builders were supposed to follow the rules, not dictate them. But maybe I am wrong, and in that case we would be better off with something like Stellar.

In my view, "peer to peer" is key here. There are other alts that arguably are presented as cash systems too, but they are not as decentralized as Bitcoin.

Miners can force-activate segwit by using a very simple patch (Bitcoin Core will probably not release it, but it does not matter). This would require some coordination, but if segwit reaches its deadline and signaled support has stalled at 94% (or other "very high" percentage), this may be enough of a Schelling point for activating it. Once that 94% (or whatever) becomes the new 100%, non-mining nodes running the official release will activate it too.
In the end, this would not be more cartel-like than when miners (rationally) orphaned the block containing the buffer overflow, or when they did the same with the v0.7-invalid block.

I also travel a lot. For the typical small purchases, the cost of finding a Bitcoin-accepting place and the data roaming costs easily outweigh any saving. But, OK, this is probably because my home currency is EUR and I have a very good tiny-fees credit card. If your home currency is not EUR or USD, then the advantage that you get is probably higher. Anyway, I think that this sounds like an ideal use case for the LN.


People are free to meet and discuss. They can come to an agreement, too. I doubt there were actually much of any proper policy being established there, but I may be wrong. Notice anyway that it used to be much worse when we had The Bitcoin Foundation at full steam.


This is **exactly** what I was arguing for. We 100% agree here: Bitcoin will need high fees to stay secure.
So, I would say, we better start transitioning to it now (and as gradually as possible, so that we can accommodate new users). If we postpone it too much (e.g., via *artificial* changes of policy, like hardforks) we may cross the point where it is too late to have them, and we may end up with an ultimately doomed or, at least, ultimately centralized system.
Notice that [*any situation with a fixed fee is equivalent to another situation with a limited block size (...) (so) making the block size a non binding constraint and, in the same time, letting the fee be fixed as the outcome of a decentralized competitive market cannot guarantee the very existence of Bitcoin in the long-term*]( ([extremely simple formal proof of that](


Not necessarily. [Ripple has had many billions of transactions]( but five years later it is still a highly unstable shitcoin.


[Again, not necessarily.]( There are Bitcoin clones that are marginally better than Bitcoin. Bitcoin can afford being the late mover and remain in top (see [here]( an analogy with how in the history of evolution, inefficient chlorophyll displaced its more efficient alternative). Sidechains can copy any altcoin, let it be secured by Bitcoin's blockchain, and avoid any value dilution. 


This is funny, because from the same premise I reach exactly the opposite conclusion. Basic economy of scarce resources (inelastic supply, actually *fully* inelastic in the blocksize limit case) implies that the total fees will be larger for scarcer space availability. Read again Houy's essay and Pinha's short theorem. There might be an inflection point for extremely small blocks (e.g., if the top fee payer could afford to pay less than twice what the second could, less than thrice what the third could, etc.) but all evidences point at that we are far from that point.


Assuming, for the sake of dialectics, that there were indeed two camps, I would assume that you would place me on the "small block" one. Yet, I am precisely arguing against human intervention. On the other hand, you ("big blocker?") are proposing human intervention to modify the maximum block size rather urgently. Do not get me wrong: I would like to see moderately larger blocks, and also sooner than later; if we cannot have that and we are stuck with 1MB forever, then it would be quite unfortunate, but most likely not completely catastrophic.


Have a look at the literature on blockchain scalability. The fundamental issue is precisely that *blockchains do not scale* (this is the motivation behind e.g., truly scaling treechains/proofchains, also GHOST or Bitcoin-NG). As much as we are capable of stretching on-chain scaling, any full scale use of Bitcoin (see Visa level -which has big datacenters and minimal deduplication- and beyond) will not be available but through those 2nd layers.
Notice though that few, if anyone, is proposing those as *mandatory*. Segwit, e.g., is being deployed with (prudent) larger block capability, even when it could had left 1MB max if we wanted just to solve malleability for the LN.

There cannot be predictable behavior (like transaction expiry, as you suggest, or 0-conf, or non-selfish mining, or anything else) because then one day it does not work and people relying in these lose money.

Why? It is not that node count (or block count) matters in a hardfork.

Please understand the risks before using something like that. PortalWallet looks strictly superior to WarpWallet, as you avoid the risks of address reuse. However:
 - Those javascript libraries have received little to none serious auditing. BitAddress, for example, used to (very rarely) output invalid keys. You probably want something that works always, not only *most of the time*.
 - Brains are very poor sources of entropy. Key stretching is snake oil: It can gain a few orders of magnitude, but it does not fundamentally change the problem (there is, of course, a difference between requiring a few seconds in a laptop versus a few months in a botnet, but things move quickly and as years pass you may get crackable sooner than you expected). Most people have a tendency to overestimate the complexity of their brain-produced passphrases; diceware or computer-generated entropy is the only way to be sure.
 - Use of *email address* as a "salt" is risible. It does nothing. Just prepend it or append it to you passphrase and you would have an equivalent result.
 - The WarpWallet algorithm is something hard to memorize and non-trivial to implement. Sure, the parent could be capable of re-implementing it from scratch if needed, but the vast majority of potential users would need to keep a copy of the exact version used. This defeats the "brain-only" aspect of the system. At this point, it is probably safer to keep instead some 128-bit diceware in public and use your "brain" passphrase to encrypt it or use it with a PBKDF as a master key (or, rather equivalently, just use the BIP39 specification with your "brain" passphrase as the additional passphrase).
 - Consider if you can instead memorize 128 bits of dice-generated or computer-generated entropy, with [one of these methods](

Traceability is pretty much opt-in today with on-chain transactions, and it will be too on the LN.
How do you link UTXOs to identities? Most of the time, because payers and/or payees specifically want to be traceable (e.g., address reuse or *public* master public key) or because they do not care that much (usually these cases are not fully traceable, but probably traceable).
This does not change with LN. Parties who want to be traceable will simply publish signatures of the channel states, or even run their LN node in a system with remote attestation.

The block size limit has been removed, in practice, from the last release with segwit. There is now a 4MB *block weight* limit in lieu. Therefore, I would think that that would mean hard forks to 8/16/32 block weights.
There could even be some adjustment to the witness discount factor, if it is judged too small or too big. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 07:45:11

Forget hard drive space. Even with quadratic-hashing mitigation (like in 2x) blocks could take up to 100 minutes to validate on typical hardware  (this would make impossible initial block download in any reasonable way; notice that assumevalid is only safe as long as it is optional).
And even if you have a beefy workstation dedicated exclusively to that, so that you could reduce that to significantly less than 10', you cannot expect that every other peer does the same.

This is a matter of definition. We could consider Counterparty as an integral part of Bitcoin and make Bitcoin nodes validate Counterparty transactions (personally, I think that that would be a terrible idea, but it would be definitely possible).


The former is irrelevant unless I mine. The latter is still true with segwit.
*Following the valid chain*: Miners must upgrade, just like in any other softfork. Unupgraded miners would still make valid blocks (as long as they do not mine any non-standard transactions), but they should upgrade to avoid being fooled by invalid-witness blocks. Unupgraded non-mining nodes do not have this problem, because they cannot receive invalid-witness transactions in the first place.
*Verifying that the coins received are valid*: Unupgraded nodes can only be payees of non-segwit transactions. A costly Finney attack with an invalid-witness block would be possible, but it is already possible by reorganizing around a valid block too (propagation may make it slightly easier if many nodes have not upgraded, but anyway the attacker still has to spend a block). 
The other risk would be being double spent in the course of an invalid-witness reorganization, but this is solved by waiting more confirmations until the fork is resolved; it is a minor inconvenience.

My apologies if the tone have offended you as it was not my intention. I said "*probably* trolling" as in my view your reply seemed to presume that there is some sort of government in Bitcoin (like in a Central bank) that is in charge of "making policies".
That kind of absurd ideas are popular at the echochamber, where some people seem to think that AXA is governing Bitcoin and we need to put the BU Federation in charge instead.
The reality is that there is no one governing a descentralized permissionless system like Bitcoin. From the point of view of the sofware, the 1MB limit is no different of the 21M limit (philosophically yes, but this is irrelevant here): Both are consensus rules and as such both define Bitcoin, because after all Bitcoin is a consensus system (there is either consensus between all the peers or there is not; you cannot have some sort of "compromise" in that -- it is about having a bit-exact state of the world, not a sociological construct). In this sense, things like "policy" or "artificial scarcity" equally apply to the one or the other.
Now, of course, it is probably easier to get the required unanimous consensus to change the 1MB limit than it is to change the 21M limit. It needs unanimous consensus, because it essentially means that we collectively agree to let the current Bitcoin die, and we boot up a new Bitcoin (a new set of rules) from its last state. If we fail to have such near-unanimity, we may end up with a value-damaging split.

Yes. Incentives go against cartel behavior. However, the *collective conception* that, by their blocking of SegWit, those Unlimited miners are attacking Bitcoin could be enough to convince the majority of orphaning them. This would require minimal coordination and an extremely simple patch.

@_date: 2016-12-10 09:05:48
Essentially, the main issue is that you are vulnerable when you sweep the private key, so at this point it is probably better (simpler, safer) to generate offline and print the keys [with the same wallet software that you will be using](
Other than that: It somewhat encourages address reuse, which is both a security and a privacy issue. [Javascript is not the best choice for crypto]( It has received little review; there is some bug some time ago where in some (practically improbable) obscure edge case it would make invalid addresses.

Where did you got that misinformation? This is simply not true: There are no hubs in the LN; it is a fully peer-to-peer network without supernodes or privileged nodes. The cost of running a LN node is comparable to that of a chain-validating full node. 
We do not know yet about which precise topology will have the LN. However, it is most probably that nodes will preferentially attach (i.e., will establish channels with) their most frequent payers and payees. These are probably close to a small-world network, with no particular scale in the degree distribution, that is, without hubs.

My intention was not to point at my "anecdotal experience". If Bitcoin is to be massively adopted, it needs to work for (nearly) everyone, not just for the *average*.
About the hardfork: Yes, sure. I did not claim that it had anything to do with bandwidth. The blocksize limit affects a lot of separate things: bandwidth, CPU, RAM, storage and the multiple configuration parameters, like in that case, the database lock limit.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:50:10
Maybe, but there is no way to prevent it, because it is profitable. Ultimately, Bitcoin can only work if it is incentive compatible.
And *reputation* or social pressure cannot help here. Bitcoin needs that at least some miners are anonymous. This the whole point of proof of work; if block builders needed to be reputable, then something much simpler like a federated chain would suffice.

Obviously, do not post the txid. But could you please at least post the size and fee, and tell if the previous outputs have confirmed? Did you tumble the coins before sending to your Electrum? Have those already confirmed?
Did you manually set the fee?
What you can do: If Electrum marks it as "replaceable", right click on the transaction and set a higher fee. If not, find the change address (it is marked in yellow) of the transaction, and go to the adresses tab, right click on it, send from, and make a new transaction to yourself (full amount: type "!") with a maximum fee (the fees are shared across the "unconfirmed" chain of transactions and can make them be mined together).

The creator of the system did some sort of governance on the early days. This has to stop at some point, if you want a truly immutable (truly permissionless) system (if you do not, then please consider moving to a system like Stellar, where there is clearly a Foundation in charge and it does not have most of Bitcoin's overheads). The day for the last possible policy change has probably passed, or maybe still not, but anyway it does not look far.
New features, enabled as softforks, are probably a different thing (miners can secretly softfork without anyone noticing). But they will probably stop at some point also.


Sadly not. Bitcoin is a consensus system. A set of rules to independently determine the "correct" state of the ledger from a tree of blocks. If you have multiple, incompatible chains (trees, actually) the consensus set gets split and the value of coins in each subset, diminished. Because of network effects, the sum of values of the now-incompatible sub-systems is less than the original one. So, no, I do not think that this is a desirable situation.
The only way to have something like that "invisible hand" behavior is by means of value-preserving sidechains. With these, we can experiment with varying "policies" while keeping a single consensus system.

No, I do not think so. For end users, the wallet lets you change the fee, not the recipient. Double-spender script kids will still use 
And at the protocol level, payees can use the *scorched earth* defense mechanism against a double spend attempt, which eliminates the incentives for doing so and means that RBF actually makes 0-conf safer.
Remember also that replaceability functionality was there since the initial release of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin's model is that you, as a peer in the network, trust nodbody and verify everything up to the genesis block (which itself is part of the consensus rules). Here, *verify* means that you will never know which **rules have been followed**, only if a set of **constraints have been respected**.
For what we know, miners could be enforcing secret softforks (e.g., in an obscure way that is nearly impossible to detect).

@_date: 2016-12-13 01:45:01


No. There is a Schelling point for choosing which chain will win, and it is provided by the assumption that Bitcoin, as a consensus system, needs to be backwards compatible. In other words, that a hardfork can only happen through explicit voluntary action, not by accident (bug).
Have a looked at [this subsection from the last Truthcoin post](
 and at the article linked there.


It does not matter if there are thousands of them. If nodes need a big machine and the parties running them are all public and easily identifiable, they will get regulatory captured in some way. Occasionally, their interests would not be necessarily aligned with mine, and I fear that they would be more hardfork friendly and thus more subject to political influence. 


Well, there is no actual *trust* required. Peers *prove* the state of their channels. Also, they have no incentive in hiding information from you, because you could query someone else and find out anyway.


Hierarchic ≠ centralized. In a small-world network, some peers are more central than others, but they have no actual control, there is no need to trust them, and they can be trivially replaced. If one of those well connected nodes goes offline, people would simply route through the others. Not only this, but there is a very strong incentive to create backup links so that no node is critical.
@_date: 2016-12-12 10:00:17
Why not multisig?
You probably already have more than one device (e.g., a PC and a smartphone). You can very easily make a 2-of-2 multisig between them with Electrum. Just store the seeds separately.
Or, if you want a still more forgiving setup, boot Tails in another computer, make a third Electrum wallet and make it 2-of-3 multisig. Then you only need to keep that seed as a backup, and you would only use it in case you lose the phone or the PC.
@_date: 2016-11-29 09:14:39
From the link that you provided: If you compare fees yesterday to fees 12 months ago, it is something around 30%. Neither 10% nor 50%, so both you and the grandparent are exaggerating.

It surely helps Bitcoin's brand image, but it is uncertain how valuable is that. In essence, as Bitcoin moves more and more quickly (money velocity), it can support a bigger and bigger economy without being more valuable per unit. On the contrary, Gresham's law suggests that good money tends indeed to be hoarded, not spent. There is a very nice analysis here: 
If you see Bitcoin as a miracle, you should probably be glad that merchants adopt it (even in the faked Bitpay way) . If you see it as something inevitable, you would see it badly. While I can appreciate both points of view, I tend to agree more with the second.

You still have your bitcoins. On core, you will probably have them indefinitely. On unlimited, most probably too, although there are some voices close to them (fortunately, not the most technical) that defended confiscating them if they are on segregated-witness/p2sh format, or old time-locked transactions.
Notice also that most of the "division" is happening on social media and, I would even specify, mostly on Reddit. On the technical channels, irc, github, bitcoin-dev, there are just a handful of dissenting individuals, while the vast majority stand behind Core.
Do not be fooled: There is no big-block camp vs. small-block camp, nor pro-hard-fork vs. anti-hard-fork. The majority of Core devs want larger blocks and have nothing fundamental against hard-forks. The disagreement is mostly that Core sees no imminent urgency and prefers swiftlier, safer soft-forks over hard-forks whenever possible, and hard-forking only when there is minimal contention for such change, while Unlimited is proposing more rushed, contentious hard-forks, and defend that the Invisible Hand will prevent dangerous things from happening.

Of course. The same happens with cash. The same happens with on-chain bitcoin transactions. LN is not a credit network.
The point is that if you have a $1000 channel with me, and I have channels with others reaching the rest of the network, you can send up to $1000 to anyone in the network (not only to me).


No. Only the extra $1.


This is not how you calculate costs. In my case, the computer has also other uses, yes, but it is not appropriate to file the whole cost on these other uses; it is not externalizable. Maybe I would be upgrading the hardware less often it it was not for Bitcoin. There is an increased wear and power consumption, and it may have influenced -partially at least- my connectivity choice (I have cable today; I used to have ADSL).




This is plainly untrue. BIP66 nodes were all able to find the valid chain and connect to it; they stayed perfectly safe with 1 confirmation (or 2, for huge amounts that could be subject to Finney attacks); they did not have to wait 30 confirmations like SPV.


I, for one, would have to stop my node in that case. If those new users are any similar to me, they will not run a node either. Who would run those nodes? Exchanges? Universities? Foundations? Local councils? I do not see that as an improvement (I am not forced to trust them now), even if it would result in thousands of new nodes. 
Furthermore, evidence is that the number of nodes has declined in the recent couple of years, even if adoption has certainly increased and the blocksize limit has not (notice that I refer to recent years only, since when mobile and SPV clients were already there). The recent moves are that even the top exchanges are fully outsourcing their node/wallet to third parties.


You only need a map of the world if you want to visit every other place at the same time. If you just want to go from A to B, a submap that contains both A and B will suffice (sure, you will be missing longer routes that go outside of the submap, but you are not interested in longer routes if you already know that a shorter one exists).


Every full node will already have access to the topology (all channels are UTXOs after all). So all you need is to query the channel status. For short paths, it is feasible to do it in a fully decentralized way (let us say that you want to send a payment to Bob, who is three hops away from you; you know the status of the channel that you have with me, you know that you can ask me about the status of the channels that I have with my peers, and you know that you can ask Bob to tell you about the status of the channels that he has with his peers; you have all you need). For longer paths, yes, you need either full directories (or subdirectories), or alternatively some probabilistic algorithm. But even in the worst case, the maximum damage that masternodes could do is to deny service. They are very similar to torrent trackers.


For certain network topologies, it definitely can scale. E.g., in a quite likely small-world topology, nearly all the transactions ~~will be seen by a small number of nodes~~ (~log(N)).
EDIT: will only *require to be processed* by **some** small set of nodes; I do not imply that it would be *the same* set of nodes in all the transactions.
This is further improved by the fact that nodes will not pair randomly, but preferentially to the peers with which they expect to transact the most.

Yes, fake signaling is a very dangerous thing. Just like with NotBitcoinXT or NotBitcoinClassic (which is what mined the vast majority of XT blocks and Classic blocks), we could have a NotSegWitCore where an early activation orphans the blocks by the enforcing minority.
To minimize this risk, support signals are counted for retarget periods (not as a sliding window), and they require a very high percentage (95% is significantly distant from 49%).

If it fails to activate, but it has got 51% support or more, I think that is is quite probable that all those miners that are fed up with political games will simply force-activate it.
Usual cartel behavior is disincentivized in Bitcoin, but special situations like this one may be enough to propel the required coordination for such action (in the process, they will eat the share of the pie of the segwwit-blockers). Some Bitcoin Core devs are opposed to release code that activates softforks at less than 95% signaling, but anyone can make a patch that changes the couple of lines required for that.
@_date: 2016-11-30 23:15:54
The vast majority of LN users will be connex. Why? Because there is an incentive for that. 
And you insist on the locking: Bitpay will not have anything "locked". For the payments collected through the LN, they will sell those Bitcoins to their fiat suppliers preferably on the LN itself, all instantly. And if still a higher bidder insists in getting paid to an obsolete on-chain address, they will broadcast the transaction and it will get confirmed in less than an hour (not weeks or months).

Feerate heterogeneity highlights how far are we still from a mature system. The economical optimum would be that each feerate is around the minimum needed for inclusion.
Fun fact: Blocks are optimally full only if there are many blocks (and so, many miners) where inclusion is desired. If the strategy for everyone were to get next-block confirmation and only this, then optimal-fee blocks are *not* full. By extension, in case there is a single monopolistic miner (or a mining cartel), optimal-fee blocks are not full either.

*Au contraire*, mining has become so competitive, and profits so marginal, that miners are selling nearly everything they get. It is a bit better for miners because they assume a big risk factor, but they do not get any significantly better deal over buyers.

Personally, I do not care much if in the end my citadel is much smaller than Roger's.

The grandparent and the great-grandparent are probably trolling.
Bitcoin has an anti-spam block-size limit at 1MB. We are currently under a spam attack (apparently very costly for the attacker) that makes blocks full and requires that legitimate transactors pay a higher fee than usual.
A small group of people with deep pockets are currently proposing to set a Federation that will control those block size limits and release software (incompatible with the Bitcoin consensus rules) that would eventually let miners set the limit (something that many experts see as unsafe and centralizing). There is no indication that these people are linked to the attack, but at the very least it perfectly fits their agenda.

Bitcoin distribution is so diverse ("fair", if you want) because 4 whole years after launch blocks were still giving a 50 BTC subsidy. Even then, a usual criticism against Bitcoin as something valuable is that early adopters got unfairly rewarded. 
If XCP had any value, it would be duplicated as a sidechain or at least as a no-deadline proof-of-burn. This is the only way in which Bitcoin could evolve into it in a safe way. The way in which it is done today, if Bitcoin fails then Counterparty fails, therefore Counterparty will always necessarily be less valuable than Bitcoin (also, empirical market evidence supports this).

It may be safe enough most of the time, but it could have bugs that make you lose money.
An attacker would have to identify that you run bcoin, and then mine a poisoned block that is acceptable for it but invalid for core. If you use it for small amounts or for reversible payments, and wait for many confirmations, you are probably safe; it would still be somewhat better than SPV security.
Notice that, strictly speaking, there is a bit of the same risk in every new release of Bitcoin Core, or with Core-derived alternative implementations like Bitcoin Knots or Bitcoin Addrindex (even if these patch sets are not believed in principle to alter any consensus-critical part).

I would say that I am a rather average bitcoiner. I do about a dozen transactions per month, half of them as a sender, most of them not urgent. For me, the cost of running a node is many orders of magnitude larger than what I pay as transaction fees.
And no, I do not want to downgrade my security: If I wanted to SPV/outsource my security/just keep the keys, then I would be using something like the Ripple scam, which although centralized, it is more efficient than Bitcoin.

This is highly unlikely. Other miners are building 1MB blocks, and they are doing it actively (by default, the soft limit is at 750kB). They were already doing it before we had compact blocks, which have significantly reduced how much data is transmitted after a block is found. 
More importantly, by any visible measure, the % of orphans for full blocks is much smaller than the fee/subsidy ratio.
And, frankly, if propagating 1MB is costing over $1k, this would mean that something is very [wrong](
@_date: 2016-12-10 22:48:42
You mean "locked" as in that they can instantly freely move across the network, right? You "lock" the coins on-chain and "unlock" them on-LN. 
If anything, the increased velocity may actually *pull* the price (exchange rate vs. fiat) a bit. However, I expect that the increased utility opened with the LN will greatly push the price more largely.

All soft forks degrade the security of unupgraded nodes, and they do so gradually, as the new feature gets more and more use. 
Fortunately, as long as enough economically significant nodes upgrade (even if it is just an ecnomic minority), the miner incentives are aligned; coins on newly invalid blocks degrade to worthless.
This is not different for *forward blocks*, which fits entirely the definition of soft fork. Security of unupgraded eventually falls below SPV-level, but that is not definitory.
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:34:13
how do you reach that conclusion?
@_date: 2016-12-05 13:58:17
My point is that individual incentives push miners to use the widest possible set of rules that is accepted by non-mining economically significant users. E.g., miners could enforce the default soft-limit of 750kB; inelasticity would ensure that the total fees are much larger in such case (response is superlinear), yet they are not doing it not because of benevolence or to avoid reddit shaming, but because they have the incentive to manually set it to its maximum possible: 1MB.


Yes, but this is something wider than block-structure rules: Ultimately, miners could also censor certain transactions (redlists/blacklists). Mining is permissionless and so that kind of cartel-like behavior is disincentivized, but that is probably one of the weakest aspects of Bitcoin. Against that, the only deterrent is a credible threat to change the hashcash algorithm (which essentially means that we found a new Bitcoin). As long as the threat is credible, we will never need to execute it (a split would be more damaging than either set of rules; I believe that the ETH/ETC schism was possible only because there is a strong Foundation and because the network does not have any real use, but it would be impossible in Bitcoin).

Bitcoin is the name of the entire system, not just the base main blockchain. Lightning and Liquid have their own use cases, but really need no "final settlement" which anyway does never happen on the blockchain (which is probabilistic). FWIW, LN has instant finality and Liquid has 1-block finality.
@_date: 2016-12-01 00:06:02






Against the incentives? How? Imagine we have a well connected set A and a well connected set B, but no link between. Whoever links them will be able to take a sizable fee, the process is permissionless, and the more the merrier, so they will get linked. Now renormalize and iterate, up to the individuals. (and then, because there is no way to limit the linkings, the Tragedy of the Commons will ensure that fees fall to minimal).


It is a network, not isolated channels. Bitpay will have no need to "close" and then "reopen" channels. They will just collect from the merchandise purchasers (those who pay in bitcoins) and send to the fiat suppliers (those who buy Bitpay's bitcoins), through different channels, yes, but on the same network.


AFAIK, Newegg only sees USD in a Bitpay account (periodically cashed out, I presume). And yes, Bitpay controls a very big amount of bitcoins. The largest caches of online bitcoins are probably in control by Bitpay, Coinbase, Exchanges' hot wallets, DNMs' hot wallets, and services like BitGo. These will probably have tons of channels on the LN.


If that were the case, they would not be willing to lock up operating funds in the form of bitcoins on the blockchain either in the first place. Yet this is exactly what they are doing. The fiat &lt;-&gt; blockchain link is the one that has longer delays and heavier friction; the blockchain &lt;-&gt; LN is trivial in comparison.
@_date: 2016-11-29 13:43:37
OK. Then let us look at fees per transaction instead of total fees per block. The minimum fee used to be ~10 bits back then:  ; now they are at ~150 bits (and it was much larger a few days ago, at the peak of the attack). So, yes, the 10% figure is incorrect; it is more like 7%.
Notice that blocks have been "consistently full" for more than one year: 
I have had a look at my wallet: I way paying ~13 bits back in March, ~20 bits in May and ~120 bits in June. For me, this is a rather clear evidence of inelasticity. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 20:51:10
Imagine a situation where the block subsidy has become insignificant, and still there is no size limit (or it is much larger than what is typically used). Pre-consensus mechanisms make orphan rate independent of the blocksize. How do you keep the blockchain moving forward?
Some people have suggested *hashing assurance contracts* that could be financed by demurrage (formally keep the 21M supply limit, but in practice keep fresh coins flowing through). See the argumentation here: 
@_date: 2016-11-29 15:41:56
Since you mention exchanges, did you know that the very first version of Bitcoin had transaction replaceability and that Satoshi thought about using it for high frequency trading? 
In the end, it is a matter of definitions. In the future, I will be happy if my wallet can take advantage of the LN and sidechains, but if you desire to stay on-chain only, you will be able too! (not only this, but you may end up paying less in fees, because of the diminished on-chain pressure).


That is not what I said. Even if there were a 2-way pegging, the MetroCard issuer is more likely to default than the USD issuer. Look at your sibling reply by SatoshisCat, who added a remark to this point:

1MB in 2010 was clearly too much. In 2013, and after a ton of improvements, a 500kB block caused the blockchain to accidentally fork itself (the upgrade to leveldb made it worse, but it would have happened just with bdb).
Also, personally, I have not seen any bandwidth improvement in the last years. I live in a big city in Western Europe, and in 2009 I had a rather shitty fiber (15down/1up) that today has still not improved a bit.

Schnorr maybe? Yes, it can help, but we need to support the legacy signature type too. Which means that we would have 1MB for legacy and 31MB for the new type.
 The main non-FUD criticism against Segwit was that it gives an unfair advantage to the new type (and indeed, extending the discount to non-segwit is in Rusty's and Luke's hardfork wishlists). If a ~2x advantage was already quite contentions, good luck trying to get consensus for a 32x advantage

Maybe that would not require a datacenter, but it would demand at least a big server. Some time after Gavin proposed 20MB blocks, [he realized that RAM costs would be unacceptably expensive]( ~10k yearly only for the memory, not counting bandwidth, CPU or storage. If those were the conditions today, a majority of the nodes would probably shut down.
I do not think that that would be completely catastrophic, but I do think that it is not worth it if the only benefit is that we will be able to fill the chain with spam and microtransactions.
If adoption skyrockets, then I am confident that we will move promptly towards increased capacity. But today, with fees at ~12c, there are nearly no signs that any economically meaningful transactions are being left behind.


Fortunately, I will be able to query other peers too. This is exactly the same reason for which my node connects to 8 other peers (to find about blocks and unconfirmed tx) instead of just one.


As I mentioned, people will preferentially attach to their payers and payees, so there will not probably be any hubs at all. The vast majority of transactions will route through very few hops (because there are incentives that make that the case), so only occasional, improbable, long-range transactions will percolate through the network.
Anyway, let us suppose that I am wrong and that the LN evolves into a hub-and-spoke model. Still, that would not be much worrisome. As long as the substrate layer is decentralized, the LN will be fully trustless, so there is no big deal if some of the higher levels are centralized. With onion routing, hubs would not even be able to discriminate DNMs. Notice also that the converse is not true: If the "on-chain" substrate layer is centralized, then SPV Lightning nodes would not be fully trustless, even if they form channels in a non-hierarchical network.

stable relative to what? to USD? You keep USD if you want that... 
Store of value means that its value (e.g., relative to other things) will tend to appreciate over time. Products that appreciate quickly, would typically do it at high volatility. Volatile assets, like artwork or stocks, are generally considered good stores of value. Bitcoin is actually less volatile than some small-caps, and it is well beyond the efficient frontier of them (it has higher return at equivalent volatility).

Your coins on the LN are still your coins, just in the same way as your coins on the blockchain (the base protocol has no ownership concept). The only difference, is that instead of providing a UTXO set and signatures to transact, you need to provide a certain channel state and signatures.


This has nothing to do with "pull" or "push" payment systems. One day, if credit card payments are made instant, you would just swipe yours at the entrance and the turnstile would unlock.

In that for Satoshi, and for everyone running the very first 0.10 version, there was already a concept of off-chain transactions.


Not at all. The LN is as trustless as the blockchain; it has practically the same security model, at least for full nodes, and it is just a bit stricter in that you need to come online for both sending and receiving instead of just for sending.


LN transactions are pretty much standard Bitcoin transactions. Yes, there can be obscure bugs not yet discovered, but in that case they will likely affect both LN and on-chain transactions.

Softforks are not incentive compatible when it is just the miners that enforce them. They can be dropped at any time and this would be a non-fork from the perspective of economically significant nodes.
Users, not miners, make bitcoins valuable.
In your example, the moment a valid block with a letter 'A' appears, rational miners will mine on top of it (because it would be a valid block by the economic majority) assuming that he miners-only softfork has been dropped. Those failing to do so would be disadvantaged. [Have a look at the BIP66 forks]( and think what would have happened if normal nodes were accepting both chains as valid (notice also that, at that time, the openssl vulnerability had not been [disclosed yet]( BIP66 was an uninteresting step "in the direction of reducing malleability" but without really solving it).

"Economic decision" or "fundamental" may be relevant to the humans behind, but they are irrelevant to the software. Bitcoin is a decentralized system of peers that arrive at a consensus on a common state of the world.
If you put a "governing body" on top of that then, yes, you can have modifications of the rules not commonly perceived as "fundamental" by humans. But at that point it is probably better to have them simply sign the blocks instead, something like in *delegated proof of stake* or in Tendermint. The ending system may still be able to work as a peer-to-peer currency --I do not know--, but it is surely much weaker than Bitcoin today.

In that case, the refund transactions are timelocked for everyone. Since nearly nobody likes waiting, people will most probably cooperate and finalize the transaction. No party can rob the other, so there are not blackmail situations possible. Since such half-baked transaction states are clearly lose-lose, we can conclude that they will be rare. 
Now, someone will still do it for the lulz. However:
 - Disruption will stay limited and contained; money burning is a naturally self-limiting practice.
 - While LN transactions can be untraceably onion-routed, you will certainly be (carefully?) choosing your channel peers. They will typically be your friends, your favorite merchants, your employers/contractors, or your (God forbid) centralized exchanges. You certainly do not need to trust them with money, but you can probably trust them not to IDIFTL any often.

It seems to me that you wanted to get rich quick and somehow feel that the Bitcoin train has passed but you can still do it by pumping some shitcoin. Unfortunately, no, it does not work like this, essentially because Bitcoin is permissionless and so it can incorporate any innovation that proves successful in some alt (as a softfork in the vast majority of cases, which can be UASF, or as an ext-block or side-chain for the more exotic ones).
Also, that is almost guaranteed to happen, because all the Bitcoin stakeholders are interested in it. As a gedankenexperiment: If it does not, if something else supersedes Bitcoin, it would mean that cryptocurrencies as a whole would have failed as a long-term store of value, and so their value is pure negative-sum pump-and-dump.

No, it does not work like that. Channels are bidirectional, and they are interconnected; you do not need to close and re-open. Even if you only have a signal channel, you can most likely use it to send to anyone in the network.


It is hard to estimate (the computer has other uses too) but probably not less than $10/month; and much more if I also count my time.


This is probably true today, because there is still much benevolence in the network (stemming from the good old hobby days of amateur dedication). Today, I could consider piggybacking on others so that they validate the rules for me, because I know that running a node is affordable, that they are unlikely to collude to collectively defraud all the piggybackers, and that while we still lack *fraud proofs* in the network, someone will come to reddit/twitter/whalepool whenever they observe anything fishy.
However, the safety of this assumption falls down if nodes become prohibitively expensive to run. As I said, it might still be OK if I can pool the node costs with my church or with my tribe or neighbor association. The issue comes when only the big players can run a node (e.g., pools, wallet providers, payment processors, the Foundation, etc.), because then users are no longer in control: Nodes would get regulatory captured, would need to get certified, and would eventually enforce blacklists and maybe even permanent inflation. 
An empirical example: At the time of the BIP66 fork (SPV mining), devs estimated that 30 confirmations were enough for SPV, but this is only because there were indeed many independent individuals that could immediately validate, alert and call out publicly to avoid longer forks. Even then we still got a 6-block-long fork.
When only big players validate: In Ripple, the first thousands of blocks following the genesis have been lost forever. The state of the ledger (balances) is known, but the early transactions are not. For what we know, there could have been all kinds of corruption, invalid transactions approved, confiscation, etc., and then the operator of the only server validating back then would have accidentally "lost" (erased) the evidence.


No, this is not true (except in the worst case scenario of a degenerate network topology consisting in a single chain). Even then, you are not obliged to take the optimal route. Actually, most of the times it may make sense to take a suboptimal route that is just "good enough". Also, if routing fails occasionally (e.g., because information is old) there is no harm and you would just try again.
@_date: 2016-12-03 01:10:25
No. There is no sense in *sending to* a particular address of yourself (plus, ideally, you should never reuse a previously used address; coins will not merge because of this).
What you need to do: Electrum has a "send from" option. In the addresses tab, right click, send from. You need to locate the change address from the stuck transaction (it is the one in yellow), and then you *send from* this one a new transaction fully to yourself, and with a fee that is high enough to cover both transactions.

I am afraid that you might be misunderstanding the Lightning Network. All the channels are interconnected: Once you have a channel with someone, you can transact with any other peer in the network. You do not "lock up" your funds in any significantly different way that when you "lock up" your funds when you buy bitcoins. In the future, you will buy bitcoins in an exchange (e.g., Bitsquare) and you will withdraw directly as a LN channel. LN transactions are pretty much standard Bitcoin transactions. Once adoption reaches a critical mass (easy, as soon as the major wallets and payment processors adopt it) you will not need to send coins to "old style" on-chain addresses again, unless you want to move them to cold storage.


Anyone can join and so there will be an excess of liquidity. Have a look at Joinmarket to have an idea of the fees in those type of system: Even if it is a much smaller network, fees are already practically insignificant.

This is nonsense. Segwit has exactly the same complexity as a softfork or as a hardfork, and it is much faster and safer to deploy it as a softfork. The only thing that you could argue is that it may be more "elegant" to have the witness Merkle root at the header instead of at the coinbase, but this is a matter of taste at best, hardly "technical debt".
Ironically, you say that you prefer a 2MB bump on top of it. This doubles the complexity (have a look at BIP109) or leaves you exposed to poison blocks that take hours to validate (yes, this has happened in Ethereum: miners just swallow them and regular nodes are left behind until the Foundation mandates a clean-the-mess hardfork).

Well, I would bet that many transaction makers value the fees in terms of fiat-equivalent value, not BTC. This is certainly the case of spammers and piggybackers (Counterparty, SatoshiDice, etc.), because they have no stake in BTC.
Apart from that, most miners operate with tight margins. They pay for electricity in fiat-equivalent prices (even if they can pay in bitcoins!). And if the fiat exchange rate appreciates, this attracts more hashing and difficulty goes up, so I do not think that they can truly afford to long-term plan to tune fees, in most cases. The result is that fees largely respond to transaction demand, which is majoritarily valued in fiat-equivalent terms.
@_date: 2016-12-11 17:20:34






There is no actual locking! When you "lock" coins on-chain you "unlock" them on-LN and they can be freely moved across the network. The way I see it, there would be little sense for having a hot wallet whose coins are not permanently on the LN: Security properties are the same, fees are inferior and confirmations are instant. Old-style addresses would be exclusively used for cold storage (airgapped LN signing is possible, but you use the private key multiple times; feasible for a hardware wallet, but not for extreme security cold wallet).


AFAIK, big miners have a tendency to run heavily customized software. Bitcoin Core is very well documented, but even then it is a good practice that some of the devs meet with some of the "power users". This happends primarily at conferences; however, conferences are typically very technical and, while they may be good for e.g., the Electrum guy, for the Blockchain.info guy and for the Bitgo guy, they are probably not specifically appropriate for miners. Thus a specific event targeted at miners (that is, pool operators and those who actually run a node) could make sense.
That said, I concede that the event was quite controversial. Adam bargained if Blockstream was or was not endorsing the agreement, Mark stepped back after that, and Greg went as far as mildly insulting his colleagues.


As I mentioned, everything points at that we are past the inflection point; half the block space would *more than* double the total fees. Have you looked at Houy's paper (the one that I linked in my previous reply)?


I *totally agree* with you! I already talked about that; this was the point of my first reply to this thread: For the typical user, the cost of using Bitcoin is dominated by the cost of running a node, and fees are *still* much smaller compared to that. There must thus exist a balance between transaction fees and resource usage. 
Let me add a small node on SPV: Bitcoin is a p2p system; SPV wallets do not properly *use Bitcoin* but let others use it on their behalf. Now, I already trust my good friend with money, so I *might* consider sharing a node with him, as I would with my tribal chief (but never with my bank, not even with my university). The main issue is that he is not much richer than me: The *cost of node* could probably still double, even maybe triple, but not more than that before we would transition to a semi-centralized system.


No, it is obviously not more *useful*. What I said is that it has more capacity and that it has processed many more transactions. This evidences that scaling, alone, does not necessarily make the system any better: If you are centralized like Ripple, all you can get is a fully premined shitcoin on a privacy-nightmare bankchain (a.k.a. the worst of both worlds: full transparency, unlike in traditional banking, and fully permissioned, unlike with true money).


Sure they are.


No, there is no evidence of that. Consider the JoinMarket. It is nearly certain that DNM coins pass through it, yet there is absolutely no evidence that JoinMarket coins are left *tainted* in any way or that they can be sold for less. On the contrary, public personalities are putting their legit money there, making it pass through it as coinjoin offerer transactions. They would not be doing that if the taint were making their coins less valuable (and no, the fee incentive has become so extremely minimal that it does not really matter). 


I agree. However, pump and dump shitcoins are not competition; they are sucker traps. Evidence shows that [Bitcoin does not have any competition](


Last time that the blocksize soft limit was raised, the total fees per block fell. More recently, variance backlogs with full blocks have made e.g., fees raise by as much as ~50% for only ~20% variance (there are transitory effects here, but we could assume that, *grosso modo*, those significantly higher fees correspond with more urgent transactions). Also, some of the criticism to Segwit has expressed concerns of a reduction of the *total fees*, even if blocks are larger.


I would say that here is where we primarily disagree. The first version of Bitcoin got a few things wrong, and not only technically but also at the more fundamental level of "economic characteristics" (it still got *most* things right though). Satoshi was a genius, sure, but not infallible. For example: v0.10 followed the longest chain, not the heaviest, so it was not incentive compatible. It also had a halving reset, so that supply was actually unlimited, not 21M (see BIP42). It had a trivially DoS-able attempt at payment channels (through nSequence), an exploitable pay-to-IP-address mode, incentive incompatible 0-fee capacity up to a limit. The *effective* blocksize limit was thought to be at 32MB, but the bdb lock limit led to consensus failures for ~500kB blocks.
As far as I am aware, Satoshi mentioned that **if** a blocksize limit increase were ever needed, it could be done as a hardfork planned several years in advance. He made no promise there nor any kind of binding testament.


The limit has been there, *forcing* Bitcoin blocks, since practically forever. It is pretty much an intrinsic part of Bitcoin today. Sure that it can be changed, but doing it (not failing to do so) is an intervention on the system.
Houy's and Pinha's proofs show that having a blocksize limit is necessary for a functioning Bitcoin.


The LN has already a working prototype on the testnet, so it is rather well known how it would be able to work. Even in the worst case, the full routing maps could be obtained from a regular full node (all the channels correspond to some UTXOs). LN nodes do not need to process anything else than the transactions that route through their channels.

Sorry if I was not clear enough: I mean that bitaddress.org is not properly a wallet itself; it will not sign transactions. So since you still need to use a proper wallet, it is probably better to use it offline to generate the paper wallet, like in Rusty's guide. Additionally, this minimizes the risk of format incompatibilities (e.g., most but not all wallets support BIP38).


Bug-free software does not exist at this level of complexity (it is not impossible, but we are far from that, as far as I am aware). My point is that bitaddress receives much less review than, say, libsecp256k1 (which I heard that it has been partially formally verified), or than the Java/Python libraries typically used in other wallets.


Well, how many addresses am I supposed to need? And, more importantly, what happens when I exhaust them? Sure: I prepare the airgapped setup again and go print a few more... when I find the time for doing it; or am I instead tempted to just reuse them?
Alternatively, you could, you know, make nice printable paper wallets at bitaddress.org that contain BIP39 seeds.

I think that there might be some misunderstanding. To be clear: I support bigger blocks, starting with what segwit could offer right now. The cost of these would be a small part in my "total cost of node", and I want Bitcoin to scale to serve millions of users. What I noticed is that we are still very far from that point, and that fees are not a problem at all (a tiny inconvenience, at most) unless you want to spam the blockchain with dice games, shapeshifts, piggybacking (Counterparty, etc.) or microtransactions.


Basically, its decentralization. Especially, the fact that you can still compete and buy blocks over tor, and resist cartel-like behavior by the major pools. Individually, miners will not "accidentally" orphan a block with a wikileaks-paying transaction because they would be at a disadvantage (and thus driven out of the market). And if a majority cartel were to impose a censorship softfork (redlists they called them in the Bitcoin Foundation), there is the credible threat that we would then change the hashcash algorithm (not a strong guarantee, I agree, but probably enough).


Of course not. I just say that a legal-only Bitcoin (and still, legal in which jurisdiction?) is uninteresting because there are fully regulated, centralized alternatives that work more efficiently. I like *illegal money* because that is an empirical proof that it is really valuable (i.e., not because the law says so but even against it). I want *good money*.


The community decided nothing. That is the point. Everything is going as coded; there is no governance. I would like that we could all come to an agreement on better scalability (and I hope we may still have it), but if we cannot, good: This would proof that Bitcoin has passed the decentralization point and become fully immutable and fully predictable.


Have a look at what happened with Changetip (or with paytoshi.org). Micropayments are just not valuable, no matter how many thousands of transactions you have.
Also, if a Bitcoin clone overtakes Bitcoin, this would prove that cryptocurrency cannot function as a long-term store of value (because then a third one could reasonably overtake that one, and again and again). It would be clear that they are not more than uninteresting pump-and-dump tulips, inefficient as means of payment and unreliable as store of value. Why I think that this will not happen? Because this is not Myspace nor Netscape: Every stakeholder in Bitcoin is heavily invested in its success up to a fanatic degree (e.g., notice all the ToTheMoon circlejerk). The cost of switching is prohibitively expensive, e.g., I would never switch my 1% stake in Bitcoin for let us say a 0.1% stake in that new supposedly-better Ecoin.


Do not strawman or outergroup, please. First, I am not a "small blocker" and I find it quite repulsive that people is dividing others in those categories. All that I have said, I believe, goes against central planning. 
As for "Satoshi's vision", frankly, I do not worship him, and I do not care, but I do not think it is any far from what I exposed.

My comment was quite specifically about practical privacy, for which things are not "private" or "not private" but somewhere inbetween. My point is that Bitcoin is (can be, if that pleases you) more private than its competitors.


It does have some merits, but it is nonetheless largely a shitcoin that works on proof-of-fluffy-ponies.
Please notice that privacy is not only about on-chain traceability of money flows. E.g., most of the times exchanges is where privacy fatally fails, so a coin that has closed money-transfer loops is essentially more private most of the time (even if stop-points are identifiable pseudonyms). Then, P2P network is key for privacy too, and Bitcoin is leading this front with dandelion. Also, the LN is some sort of ultimate eraser of on-chain traces.

In the current LN, channel creation does indeed depend on on-chain transactions, but all the subsequent payments i.e., "usage" does not. With channel factories, even channel creation is off-chain on the intermediary layer.
There will always be demand for on-chain space, to support all these higher layers, for maximal-security high-value settlements, for long-term cold storage, or for meta-stuff like OpenTimestamps, but all (or at least most of) "payment use" could be **largely decoupled from it**. 
By extension, bigger blocks may be eventually required, especially when we think of global adoption, but probably not for tomorrow.

I mostly agree, but I think that they ideally need a small economic support (even ~1% should be enough), because if not the softfork can be dropped at no cost. There is a disadvantage when trying to orphan a previously valid block, if you know that all users would still accept it as valid.
This is the problem with secret softforks. Rationally, miners should be prepared to drop them at any time. And I think that this is true even if there is signaling but is ignored by all regular users.

Yes, of course. In my hypothesis, I interpreted the OP's "segwit failed to activate" as meaning that we have passed the late 2017 activation deadline.
Then, of course, miners are free to do whatever they want. They can force-activate next month, but in that case I would be a bit worried for the "political collusion" that such a fact would indicate.
@_date: 2016-11-28 14:24:17
Well, I have not seen it before, but it looks like a rather intuitive calculation. 1GB blocks provide a maximum of 7000 tx per second. Big subway stations have typically several dozens of turnstiles, each usually permitting a flow of about [one passenger every two seconds]( Therefore, if everyone paid in bitcoins, I bet that we would need the entire network, or one of the busiest lines at least, to exhaust the 0.1GB/minute capacity. 
Tokyo's [Shinjuku Station]( is the World's busiest. It links 50 platforms of trains/urban trains/metros and handles over 3.5 million passengers daily. Peak hour flow for the metro is around 15 passengers per second per line (capacity 3000, headway 90'', 50% minimum passing through). This corresponds to 3.5% of the total passengers (boarding only, which is when they would pay), so the maximum capacity is less than 500 passengers per second.
So yes, 1GB blocks should be more than enough for a single station. That said, it would be much better if commuters used the LN instead, as this would avoid having to wait 1h for payment confirmations.

We have seen it before, when miners orphaned the "buffer overflow" block and the "invalid BDB lock limit" block. If it becomes clear that Bitcoin is under a severe value-damaging political attack, it can happen.


It is an extremely simple patch.


Right after the segwit-blockers would have been orphaned, there would be 100% signaling segwit, so regular unpatched 0.13.1 nodes would see it as activated and would be able to use segwit transactions safely.

It does not look too much complicated.
*Economy* is the management of limited resources. In our case, of the block space (which has a capped supply). An increased demand for this increases the price. Or, in OP's terms, its *demand rises in tandem with the price*.
@_date: 2016-11-24 16:15:11
Yes, of course. This is why crying "artificial scarcity" is redundantly nonsense.
From the point of view of the sofware, the block size limit is as fundamentally artificial as the coin supply limit. To change either, we need the consent of nearly every user (or, at least, a very big economic supermajority; that is by the economic actors --users-- that make bitcoins valuable, not only by miners).
@_date: 2016-11-09 21:17:32
There is a problem also with the very concept of addresses, even if they are *stealth addresses*: A base58 string is very difficult to recognize; most people will only check a few chars at the start and the end.

My average fee for the last month was slightly below 2c. The maximum that I **ever** paid is 12c for a priority transaction during a spam attack. Fees could grow two orders of magnitude.


I would concede that Bitcoin is still a small part of my everyday economy (even when it is most of my savings). That said, I think that I am a heavier user than the average of those supposed "millions" of users from Coinbase and Blockchain.info. 


It is strongest as uncensurable money. 
Frankly, personally I cannot hide my income, I never do illegal things and I am not persecuted in any way. In my greediest days, I think to myself *WE, I just want to go to the Moon*. But then there are news about a new bank bailout, Snowden/Assange/Ross, poor cash-dependent Indians ruined, etc., and I remember why I support this project and what is the only way in which it can be *good money*, i.e., by avoiding any Foundation, charismatic leader, "governance" or other form of political control.


It will be enough as long as there is a healthy fee market, and we will only have a fully developed fee market if we slowly evolve and transition towards it.
The "low fees now -&gt; widespread adoption -&gt; then high fees" path cannot be set without central planning. Even if it where optimal, it probably could not lead but to an uninteresting Paypal 2.0. The Goolge/Facebook model of "turn evil once they achieve World dominance" works for startups, but not for p2p projects.


At this level, fees do not slow down adoption. Microtransactions do not make Bitcoin any significantly more valuable. I will let Litecoin, Dogecoin or the shitcoin *du jour* handle them, if they want (looking at coinmarketcap.com, we could go from $13B to $14B market cap if we included all use cases; clearly not worth it if we weaken Bitcoin in the process).


Well, only if we consent to having a central committee (or an "emergent consensus" or whatever) that changes it every now and then. As long as it is predictable (fixed or evolving, or with something like the secondary-incentive flex-cap) it would not be manipulative.

I frankly don't get it: The model clearly deviates from reality at the sharp "halvening" episodes. One could maybe argued that it makes some damping, but we have only two such episodes and the damped response is totally different between them.
Essentially, stock to flow is integrative (as new *flow* stacks on the *stock* over time). One can instead take time-since-genesis as the dependent variable, and this still results in a nice fit, just with exponent 6 instead of exponent 3.

 - The particles (laser photons) do travel through the atmosphere. A split beam is simultaneously measured at base stations in Austria and China. Information is encoded in the polarization correlation, so a single beam leaks nothing.
 - The technique has been known for a while ([e.g.]( and tested in ground lasers and optical fibers. There is some challenge in doing it with a moving satellite, but it still looks like an excessively expensive experiment.
 - It is a basic research project, not military. There is little military use: A much simpler classical signal split with two untangled lasers would achieve the same functionality.

Your master pubkey is not private and you better assume the attacker has it (best case it stays unprotected in your hackable device, but unless you have your own node it is probably being transmitted over the internet too). If it stays private and you never reuse addresses, then yes, then your security climbs to 160 bits, but do not rely on it.
On the "one bit per letter" thing, I cannot remember the source now, but I remember that it is asymptotically, for long passphrases. First letter has nearly 5 bits, but it decays rather quickly from there. Anyway, my point is that people tend to greatly overestimate the entropy of their passphrases, and this is how [e.g., brainwallets from obscure Afrikaans poems get cracked](
In particular, from your birth date example, the Shannon entropy of the year is not log 50, because the distribution of internet users is not uniform from twenty-year olds to seventy-year olds. That is even more dramatic for the initials, for which JS or JM are more frequent than others.

It was a reference to BU. 
You seem to think that there is a "Bitcoin Core" organization that steers Bitcoin, but I do not think that that is the case. Firstly, people are free to run whatever they want. Then, their releases happen to be compatible with each other, back to the original 0.10 release (except from the early *longest chain* mistake). Finally, have a look at their development process: Anything that does not get a rough consensus gets rejected. 
On the other hand, practically all the consensus-critical code is detailedly specified already. When it is said that, formally, the released software is the true specification, it simply acknowledges the reality that in a *consensus system* like Bitcoin, it is the
sofware --with its bugs-- what will determine the valid state of the system (and not some specification). In practice, any bugs still remaining are probably obscure enough to get manifested in a long time, if ever.

Blockchains have huge overhead and weak guarantees.


Only under the right incentives like, you know, rewards in tokens of value representing a p2p currency.
In a truly adversarial setting, nothing but proof of work makes sense, at least for the main chain (sidechains can use alternative consensus as long as it is backed by the main chain incentives).
Something like a reasonably distributed premine + appropriately federated blockchain could make some sense, probably. But it would be much weaker than Bitcoin, so I cannot see how people could prefer it.

No. That was a fully back-compatible softfork.


We disagree here. XT is set to hardfork the moment it reaches 75% of mining. The remaining 25% branch may have strong economic support and it might go on in parallel, at least for a while. As for the XT branch, a 25% drop in security might not be catastrophic, but Metcalfe's law ensures at least a 43% drop in utility. I hope I am wrong, but I am far from sure that Bitcoin could successfully survive such stalemate situation.

Clearly, they still do not get it. Not even when they are told that we have eight decimal places and so.
I propose that we get a more radical stance: Bitcoin has only one type of unit: the satoshi, and it is indivisible (on the base protocol, at least). This BTC thing is just an illusion, an interface artefact, absent from the protocol, that someone once incorrectly thought convenient.
I propose that we start counting everything in satoshis. After all, Dogecoin showed that having little valued units can actually be much funny.

You would pump upstream only if there is another intermittent source of power nearby (wind, most of the times). See: 
This is called pumped-storage hydroelectricity, but it is not always available, e.g., typically in mountainous regions you do not have much water downstream to pump when the dam is already blocked (and a minimum ecological flow is necessary). You can do it when there is a big reservoir downstream that is close enough to the main hydro dam, but was not included in the dam project for some (orographic) reason. This is quite rare.

Yet, we have a real world example where it happened: dogecoin. At some point where the block reward was getting too small, miners and users rejected one of the halvings and set an unlimited supply and something ~5% inflation.
Bitcoin is following a slower schedule. Being more mature, it might or might not react in a similar way when it reaches that point.
The type of arguments used are disturbing from today's perspective: *why a hard coded constant?*, *we need to keep security while avoiding too much fee pressure*, even something like *deflation is bad for the economy; small inflation is good*.
For Bitcoin, I do not think that the next reward halving will have problems. However, from the next one, we will start approaching *mainstream*, Keynesian-loving inflation rates.
I really hope that consensus rules and the social contract does not get perverted. However, I foresee a long, eroding, heated debate. Anyway, I would avoid comparing it with the current blocksize debate, for it is about a completely different consensus rule.

Data? Metcalfe's law says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of nodes. XT will fork at 0.75 support (see the proposal) i.e., at a point where the subnetwork will be worth 0.75^2 ~ 0.56 of what was worth right before the split.

I reply to your edit: Yes, miners could in some circumstances act against their collective best interest if it is individually profitable for them. It is called the Tragedy of the Commons.
In particular, for the block size case: To avoid orphaning, miners just need to make sure that their blocks get processed by a majority of the other miners, not by all of them. If a block is too big for the smaller miners, the competition for the miner that produces it gets smaller and so it gets a competitive edge.
This why I am afraid that miners might be unable to self-regulate the block sizes, if their limit were removed or hugely increased.

Oops! My bad: it is not an alternating dollar auction, because defender always play first. Therefore the optimal is not 50% but probably something much smaller.
1% is probably enough deterrent against fluctuations (and the fact that if attacker pre-allocates nicehash for some time, defender has to bid higher for *fresh* hash power). The result, at 1% and for 6 confirmations, is that 8 BTC reward is sufficient. OTOH, notice though that some blocks transact much more than 10k BTC and requirements would need to be scaled up for them.

But will they accept this? A majority of miners may have no individual incentive to reduce the block size, especially if big blocks permit the well connected miners to get rid of competition that have worse bandwidths.

Bitcoin is a live network of peers that add and validate blocks to the blockchain according to a set of rules. A *hardfork* refers to any change of the rules that is not back-compatible, i.e., that requires everyone to update their software.
Since Bitcoin is a decentralized system, there is no central authority to set the rules or how they should change. There is no "official" client or reference implementation, just popular ones.
This works as long as the different software instances (code bases and versions) agree on the rules all the time, i.e., they are in *consensus*.
Therefore, a hardfork can break the consensus. This is why hardforking changes have been mostly proposed to solve critical bugs, where it is sure that nearly everyone will prefer to upgrade their clients and stay in the patched version of the fork.
A rule change like the block size limit is contentious. It is unclear whether it solves a problem or creates new ones. Because of this, it is very likely that a hardfork on the block size limit will split Bitcoin into two subnetworks that will coexist (at least for a while).
In this scenario, my opinion is that, yes, our Bitcoins become essentially worthless. At least, their worth is immediately halved (BitcoinXT is set to fork once it has 75% support, which because of Metcalfe's law, implies that the value drops by 43%), but the confidence in the system will get heavily undermined as well as the insecurity about its future evolution.
Bitcoin's main strength is Byzantine fault tolerance. It is because of this that it can stay uncensorable, trustless and ultimately decentralized. However, such fault tolerance is rather fragile: It requires the assumption that no attacker has more than half of the computing power and that messages get instantly propagated. This cannot be guaranteed if blocks are very large, and it is not clear whether miners would be able to safely self-regulate; it is because of this that a 1MB cap was set. If the cap is removed or significantly raised, very large blocks could appear and push towards centralization (a lot or just slightly; it is unclear). On the other hand, if Bitcoin gets massively adopted, we will need more capacity than 1MB of transactions per 10 minutes, even if the huge majority of them take place through off-chain channels.

At the decade time scale, it is the best currency around by far. Even if you look at it at much shorter frames, year to year, still most of them are positive and only two so far (2014 and 2018) have been negative, both after explosive jumps in 2013 and 2017.


Yeah, I keep hearing that "the next Bitcoin" narrative ever since Namecoin and Tenebrix in 2011. Even the most "successful" examples, Ripple and Ethereum, peaked over a year ago and are now getting disrupted by their respective more streamlined competitors. IMO, that fear is unfounded, because if a 2nd coin overtook Bitcoin, then why not a 3rd would come after, and then a 4th, and a 5th, ad infinitum? There would not be any long-term value preservation and thus no ultimate winning horse.
Also, Bitcoin can get unlimited upgradeability, to any new features found successful in competitors, be it via softfork, extension block, or sidechains.


That is the bet. It is not that different from a career choice, or a personal business investment.

If 25% of the ecosystem instantly leaves, the result would certainly be catastrophic: for the loss of network effects (nearly halving as per Metcalfe's) and, principally, for the bad precedent of contentious forking. The XT subnetwork would most likely survive, though.
About the remaining 25%, however, it is less clear to me. It is significant enough to go on, at least for a few days. Nevertheless, ultimately, a majority of the XT pools could coordinate (not necessarily collude!) to attack the 25% subnetwork with enough hash power and force it either to desist or back to the longest, rule-altered chain.

Well, the input variables are the number of confirmations and the totality of the transactioned value (as doublespenders can potentially pool together their attack, worst case) in the block that you want to consider incentive-wise final. Or you can reverse the problem and say that the inputs are reward and transactional value, and the output is the required number of confirmations.
Anyway, you end up with a trade off between reward and confirmations. Reward has to be high enough so that number of confirmations stays practical.
Now, blocks move an average of 10k BTC these days. The attacker-defender dynamics is probably something close to the [dollar auction]( model, so your risk times the number of plays (confirmations) vs. the total/reward ratio determines what those should be. With having the option of play/not play, optimal risk is around 50%, and so the optimal average reward should be larger than 5k BTC /  
As you can see, at the typical 6 confirmations, we are quite a few times below that. 
Fortunately enough, reorgs larger than 50 blocks are not automatically accepted by current nodes that had already synced. This gives the defender some leverage against the double-spender. Within that, a *safe* reward is "only" around 100BTC at current conditions.

When they recognize and trust each other, SPV mining on top of the others' headers is profitable and thus an unavoidable type of collusion, yes. But this does not mean that it is something harmless: All types of collusion and misaligned incentives are a potential danger. Consider also selfish mining and bitundo functionalities, which do greatly benefit from good connectivities.
On the other hand, there is an aspect that is difficult to understand: Even big, professional miners have a tendency to pool (i.e., to stratum-sell their hashing power) to reduce the volatility, but they often stick to one or maybe two pools instead of doing what we know is the optimal strategy (volatility wise): to mine at every (major) pool with a proportion equal to their global proportion. It seems like there is some kind of pool fidelity and an aversion to having the eggs at different baskets.

They cannot detect a softfork because there is no breaking of the old rules. It is a *change* only in the sense that the new rule is more restrictive.
However this is a necessity: In a decentralized system, you can only know if your set of rules is being respected or not; you can
never be sure if your peers are using a more restrictive version of them.

These are technical definitions and standard terminology: 
I invented nothing and what I think is irrelevant. One case is different from the other in the sense that one is back-compatible and the other is not.
In other words, in case of a *hard*fork, if you use Bitcoin, you should care. You should upgrade your client (or, if you delegated validation, make sure that your delegate upgrades; SPV gets unreliable). In case of a *soft*fork, you can safely ignore it, unless you are a miner who does not want their blocks orphaned.

Probably a reference to what has been observed with MtGox case. Creditor claims were denominated in fiat currency equivalent (based on exchange rate at the time when bankruptcy protection started). As bitcoin jumped 20x+, all claims could now be covered by the cryptocurrency holdings, plus an excess that would be left to the next in the line, this is, the shareholders.
So, essentially, it seems possible to legally use *bankruptcy protection* as a free-priced put option on bitcoin. A key for this is that the exchange is considered to be proprietor, not just custodian, of the coins; unfortunately, this has been the case even when tos insisted in the custodial interpretation.

Feel free to run whatever you want, but me I would prefer that any change in the consensus rules is done without dividing the userbase and after both sides have come to a compromise agreement.
Please make sure that you understand what *will work* implies in this case: Bitcoin XT is set to fork once it gets 75% support. A 1.1-megabyle-large block is likely to get mined right after (considering the current conditions). This, because of Metcalfe's law, implies that the value of the XT-bitcoins gets reduced to a 56%. Hardly a success, for me.

Private keys are numbers and public keys are elliptic curve points. In this sense, master and child public keys are a *scalar product* of the private numbers with a *generator* point G (and this scalar product is defined such that it is a one-way calculation, i.e., you cannot derive the *private* scalar from the *public* resulting point).
So, following your example and keeping the simplification:
    child_key = master_key + offset
becomes in terms of public keys:
    child_key * G = master_key * G + offset * G
which is the same as:
    public_child_key = public_master_key + offset * G
This is how anyone can determine the whole public-key hierarchy without knowing the private keys. This is valid for the *unhardened* set of BIP32 HD wallets.
A very similar trick is used to outsource the generation of vanity addresses in a trustless way.

I think that we all agree on this. The debate is about how to increase this.
Solving scalability is complex. Of-chain solutions like Lightning or fidelity bounded anonymous Chaumian banks require a smaller block-size increase than the everything-on-chain solution. Adam's extended blocks solution does not require any increase at all (it has its own issues, though).

In that far future situation when the block subsidy fades out, the optimal strategy for the better connected miners will be to steal the previous transaction fees (in case they were on a more limited block) and add the new ones.
There is also the argument of vanishing rent, for which the marginal cost of successfully propagating a transaction (i.e., in a block that does not get orphaned) equals the marginal revenue of its fee, and thus there is no revenue left for hashing.
Anyway, in a few decades we will have switched to extract a mining reward from Meni's fee pool or a similar solution.


This is what applies nowadays. Fees will increase with smaller blocks, not with larger ones. Therefore, the big, well connected miners can sustain that advantageous situation until their worse connected peers are forced out.

I have a couple of ASICS mining on p2pool with notbitcoinxt. I do it because it looks that a split is inevitable, so if we trigger it before XT has a majority, then they will mine invalid 1.1 MB blocks, realize of the insanity about pushing a contentious fundamental change, and go back to Core (or at least, work for a compromise).
I probably will not find a single block, but who knows. The software is out there, it works as well as XT, and probably many others are running it too for different reasons (for the lulz, for attacking Bitcoin, etc.).

I have not mined since a long time ago. Also, I have accepted that I will have to stop my full node soon.
A doubling every two years is clearly too much for me. My connection has not got any better in the last eight years.
That said, I want to see Bitcoin succeed (which for me means massively adopted **and** staying uncensorable) even if this implies that all I will have available to me is SPV security. This most likely involves larger blocks and, simultaneously, most of the transactions through trustless off-chain channels.
So, in other words, BIP101 clearly pushes towards centralization, but some centralization may be unavoidable for the success of the project. 
Personally, I think that there might be better alternatives, like Adam's extended blocks, and off-line channels like Lightning or fidelity-bonded Chaumian banks. However, while conceptually sound, I do know enough about how technically feasible these are in practice.
@_date: 2015-08-21 19:37:01

It is hard to tell.
It could be argued that the Moon scenario requires the big current financial players on board. These are already regulated and will demand regulation.
On the other hand, Bitcoin could be regulated to death. For instance, currently there are two few closed loops, so regulating the exchanges --even just a slight censorship, in the style of Coinbase or Circle-- can easily make it worthless.
Censorship resistance is fundamental for Bitcoin. If you just want a scarce token with cypto-attested transactions, then centralized alternatives are more efficient.
@_date: 2015-08-31 13:56:39


I disagree! If Bitcoin becomes a permissioned ledger (e.g., a majority of miners softfork to enforce a coin blacklist), then it does not make sense any more. Think about this: Would you use BTC as a reliable store of value (i.e., not just for speculation) knowing that somehow at some point in the future they could be found tainted and made worthless? 
In that scenario, maybe bitcoins could retain some nonzero value, because they transfer fast and easily, without counterparty risk, and because of the "network effects". However, once Bitcoin gets regulated to that point, there are centralized alternatives that make more sense. See for instance Ripple: Transactions are crypto-attested, it is centralized, but a distributed hierarchy avoids hacking risk, it transacts with little friction, it does not require any proof of work, its premined scarce token XRP is essentially worthless (in exponential decay since launch), but it offers a way to transfer IOUs and so it is a nice competitor to Paypal or Coinbase.

Miners have an incentive to mine the largest blocks possible in order to clear their least connected competition.
Block orphaning risks are a stopper, but they are not a proper self-limiter for the blocksize, because they are not the same for everyone and we have observed that miners SPV-mine on top of others' block headers.
Furthermore, economic theory predicts that a fee market will only emerge if blocks are getting full. How will we secure the network when the subsidy fades out? I know we still have time until then, but miners' incentives will be against any future more-restrictive softfork.

I added the "if feasible" condition just as a precaution because they do not exist yet; I would bet that feasibility is independent of the block size, though.

If that were true, they would not have added wipe-out protection via the "forking block must be big" rule.
If you are confident that you will replace the legacy chain, then you do not need wipe-out protection nor replay protection.
If you are not confident that 100% will upgrade and that the legacy chain may thrive in some way, then you need to add wipe-out protection, replay protection, and change address format.
Adding wipe-out protection but not replay protection means that your proposal **expressly wants to be disruptive** and as such **it is an attack**.

Well, scholar consensus tends to accept economic models that actually work, most of the time. Or at least, from a set of competing models, the one that adjusts better to reality. Models are not universal either, so lack of correspondence is often due to the fact that their assumptions are not being reflected in practice. Therefore, when the "economic theory" deviates from reality it is probably because the reality has much more complexity to what can be represented in the theoretical model. This is why microeconomic models tend to succeed and macroeconomic models tend to fail.
Debt-based money has been working surprisingly good for many decades in a second-industrial and post-industrial setting. The problem with it is political, not economical. It is a system that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer, so it can only work as long as the elite stays benevolent. More fundamentally: the merit distribution is quite static, while the wealth distribution has its own induced dynamics, so before some point, the rich are the capable, but after that point, this disaligns and you have "stupid rich", that is, an elite that is much more wealthy than what would correspond to their merit, or equivalently, much less capable than what would correspond to their wealth status. This is why it is a political issue: Power concentrates in a few, who are stupid, and who ultimately tend to get corrupted.

Unconfirmed transactions are always replaceable. If they were not, then all the overhead caused by mining and blocks would be superfluous. Therefore, there is really no such thing as "double spend attempt" for unconfirmed transactions.
Also, you cannot expect miners to be honest if that makes them lose money. Ultimately, miners that maximize profits will outcompete those that do not. *Honor system* is risky and guaranteed to eventually fail. 
Finally, RBF enables scorched earth mechanism, which implies that malicious replacement of unconfirmed transaction never pays off so, quite paradoxically, RBF actually makes "0-conf" safer.

In our context, a necessary (probably not sufficient) element in the definition may be:
"Can an individual censor (i.e., stop from propagating or stop from getting into the blockchain) a transaction that would otherwise be profitable to mine (fee/priority relative to its size)?"
It is binary and I think it more or less describes the decentralization in Bitcoin today. It is probably not true *stricto sensu* because very powerful individuals (e.g., Obama, Buffet, Xi) could censor a particular transaction or even every transaction, but at a too high cost for them.
As a definition it is far from ideal, because if an individual cannot but a reduced group can (e.g., colluding operators of the largest farms, or even bureaucrats in a Chinese ministry of finance or telecommunications) then it is still rather centralized. 
Also, a transaction should be able to transfer a value. If it does not get censored in the blockchain but it can get blocked at an end because every btc &lt;-&gt; fiat exchange is forced to follow KYC procedures, then decentralization gets defeated too (at least in the absence of closed, bitcoin-only loops). In that situation, Bitcoin could still be used for settlement of global transfers between (Bitcoin-enabled) regulated banks, but maybe a crypto-attested centralized database like Ripple is already enough for that.

Who needs fees? When the subsidy fades out, we can have instead [hashing assurance contracts]( But who will pay for them?
Well, obviously, voluntary funding will not be enough (it would be charity against motivated attackers), but we can effectively enforce everyone to pay them by hardforking one of the reward halvings to a permanent subsidy.
Of course, inflation is out of question, but we can always keep the limited supply nominally, and introduce a very small rate of demurrage. In that situation, Bitcoin may no longer be treated as a reliable store of value. But, hey, maybe it retains a non-zero value and so it makes an excellent payment system for buying coffees directly on the blockchain.

@_date: 2015-08-23 16:20:07
This is the key point. Let us recall that Bitcoin has been proven to be Byzantine fault tolerant (in the absence of a majority attacker) only for instant transmissions. 
The best interest of a miner that is among the 51% best connected (hash-power weighted, i.e., to avoid orphaning) is to get rid of the worse connected minority. In the absence of a blocksize limit, a miner can fill every block it finds up to that point and therefore, progressively push profitable mining only to the best connected spots of the Internet. Because connectivity is highly heterogeneous, the assumption that no one controls 51% becomes less reasonable in that situation. 
Please notice also that mining is what p2pool or GBT offer, i.e., it requires full validation. Selling your hash power through *stratum* to someone else in exchange for a reward does not genuinely count as mining.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:36:54
This is very good. One of the risks with the LN is that, if on-chain transactions become very expensive, many users would take the simplest, cheapest route: Set up one single channel with Coinbase and then route everything through it. As long as that works well enough, there would be little incentive to create more channels (especially if Coinbase sets zero fee, or a tiny fee compared with what you can expect to get from routing through other channels), so the resulting LN would be fragile and little private. 
Channel factories changes that: 2nd layer is necessarily on small groups, and fees to set up new channels outside the group are shared. So 3rd layer LN would be very decentralized, while still most users would only need to pay once.
Most importantly, even if consensus for bigger blocks is never achieved, it would still be imaginable to serve everyone in the world with the current 4MB weight limit.

The main problem I see is due to the fact that miner connectivies are not homogeneous but highly hierarchic. 
You may be right that orphaning probabilities invalidate Houy's argument, but not in a usable way: If I am better connected than you to a 51% of the hashing power (i.e., my orphaning expectation is smaller than yours at a given size) then I could be able to operate in a regime that is unprofitable for your (in terms of fee-per-kb).
In consequence, only the fittest connected ultimately survive, and this leads to centralization and risk of (self?-) censorship.

Not really. It does have some similarities, but it works quite differently: OB1 is based on reputation. However, on Bisq trades are fully anonymous; in fact, they are all behind tor. There is a multisig security deposit to ensure that, once an offer is accepted, the exchange goes through as set in the protocol, and at no point can one party take advantage of the other. It is a pretty brilliant design, game theoretically. The only disadvantage is that you need to have already some bitcoin to buy bitcoin.

If you do not build your blocks, you do not mine. 
 Pooled mining is what GBT and p2pool offer. Otherwise, you can sell, through stratum, your hashing power to a centralized "pool" in exchange for a reward.
@_date: 2015-08-05 09:17:04
Why make it worse for the small guys? Economies of scale already favor the big ones with better electricity costs, which are only ultimately disfavored by the laws of thermodynamics.
Still, now that the orphan rate is negligible, the reward expectation is linear with the hashing power. If we remove the max size and orphan rates become the limiting factor, as the OP suggests, then this no longer true and we essentially kill solo mining and any non-stratum pooled mining in poorly connected locations.
Let us not forget that Bitcoin is Byzantine fault tolerant only in the regime of instant propagations and under the assumption that no single entity (be it a miner or a pool without GBT) controls 51% of the hashing power.

Well, I would say that in terms of BFT we evaluate safety rather than decentralization. In this context, nodes equal miners, and Andrew Miller's proofs show that, roughly speaking, Bitcoin is probabilistically safe in the absence of a faulty majority of the hashing power and for instant transmission of messages.
We still do not exactly know how latency affects the probabilistic consensus, but we do know that even non-faulty miners have a rational incentive to weed out their worse connected competition (i.e., to force them to sell their hashing power to a stratum pool). Or, in other words, increased latency implies an increased likelihood of Byzantine failure.
However, I think that BFT considerations are not enough for decentralization. We also need to consider how non-mining agents can successfully and privately convey their transactions to the honest (non-faulty) miners. Also, how non-mining validators can detect that Byzantine consensus has failed: e.g., i) the longest chain contains an invalid transaction, or ii) a valid, sufficiently paying transaction has been censored out.

Softforks do not usually introduce bugs but fix them instead. In the case you mention, if the proof of work gets broken and needs fixing, this will necessarily require a hardfork.
More generally, in a decentralized system, the only thing you can do is to check whether the blockchain that you see is consistent with a set of rules. You cannot detect softforks. There is no way to know if the other peers have changed to a more restrictive version of one of the rules (i.e., softforked). They can refuse the blocks you mine because of rules or just because they want to.
If you do not mine, softforks do not break anything for you. You can can safely ignore them and go on validating without issues. You are not forced to upgrade and you can delay it until you have reviewed any proposed modifications.
@_date: 2015-08-10 08:32:32
You are technically right. Nevertheless, if there is a schism and both subnetworks coexist, the confidence in Bitcoin would get severely damaged. Bitcoin is a distributed consensus system in which all participants agree in the fact that a set of mutually consistent transactions took place in a particular order. Bitcoin is not about majority voting; it is about consensus. Either we keep a perfect bit-exact agreement or if not we get progressively diverging transaction histories (which are then incapable to be used as a decentralized form of money).

Or maybe he genuinely wanted to restart the rewards after a very long time period (244 years) for some reason. It really does not matter: He geniusly invented the system, but he made it explicitly evolutionary and later left it to others.
Satoshi's original vision is not important. The social contract may be important, but can be interpreted in different -even opposite- ways.

I do not care which side of the fork you call Bitcoin and which side Altcoin. In the XT schism scenario, we would probably better end up with two renamings: Bitcoin-original and Bitcoin-XT.
My point is that, while the set of consensus rules may evolve, it requires more than simple majorities to change them. The "existing" set and the "newly proposed" set are not equals. If a 51% support were enough to fork, we could quickly get an exponentially branching of independent, incompatible subnetworks. And Metcalfe's law ensuring a 75% drop in utility after each split.
That said, I honestly do not know how much support is enough. 99%? quite certainly. 95%? probably. 90%? I guess so. I lack a concrete insight, however, for my taste, XT's proposed 75% might not be enough: If a 25% of the community is left behind, the resulting network is 0.56 times as useful -per Metcalfe's- and it sets the precedent that a non-overwhelmingly supported change can pass. I am quite certain that, at some point, one of the reward halvings will get some opposition (twobitidiot is already proposing that we should leave a small inflation, and in dogecoin a majority of miners hardforked to an infinite-supply schedule).

We are discussing about XT and nobody is censoring it :)
As I said, Bitcoin does not have any "official" implementation, just popular ones. All of these currently agree on a set of rules, which currently, include 1MB max size for blocks. XT is set to unilaterally alter this rule.
My comment was not about bug-patching hardforks, where it is clear that nearly everyone prefers to stay on the patched side of the fork. It specifically referred to contentious hardforks, like the one that XT proposes.


I bet that almost everyone agrees that the 1MB limit will need to be eventually abandoned. My point is that we need to do it in a consensual way, i.e., without dividing the community in two. But yes, at some point we will need to pass through that hardforking change (or maybe softfork, if it gets done in the way of Adam's proposed extended blocks).

A small but important detail: Segwit does **not** disable ASICBOOST, just its covert form. With Segwit, miners using that trick need to either mine without the witness commitment (thus smaller block with less global fee) or user random version numbers; both clearly reveal that it is being used.

That is quite odd. So if it goes 50% up and then 33% down, it stays the same? That does not make any sense. Change the denominator to always be the larger of the two numbers, or the smaller. Or use something like log (latest amount / original amount), which at least is symmetric, and additive.

Not exactly true. Old softforks (pre bip-9) used version incrementation, which implies that all versions smaller than 4 (including all negative values; it is a four-byte signed integer) are rejected. As for the other bits, version-rolling asicboost still reserve some of them for possible future bip-9 use, even though there is no active softfork proposal right now.

This is the problem. There is currently no centralizing force in mining because rewards are linear with the hashing power, big and small get equally rewarded in proportion. However, when connectivity enters in the considerations, you are then more likely to benefit the bigger miners.
Mining is already critically centralized (mainly through stratum pools) and I do not get why we would risk making this worse. We already observed a 51% pool doing doublespends and, while it was not the end of the world (because of lucky benevolence), it is not something desirable either.
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:16:10

This is NOT good for the network. The recent BIP66 incident shows how dangerous it is: 6-block-long reorgs and PSAs asking to wait for 30 confirmations. This is attacking the network, even if unintentionally.
@_date: 2015-08-06 09:56:15
Yes. Once the system gets some sort of censorship, then there is no point in mining. At that point, a centralized system like Ripple would be more efficient.
Even more, once you destroy fungibility you are essentially under regulatory capture and any token of value is basically worthless, unless it represents a trusted electronic fiat equivalent. In other words, for a system like Bitcoin, *trustless* and *permissionless* are closely related concepts, even practically equivalent.

I think that the previous commenter means that the *payment channel network* is faster. Under some circumstances, such network at a global scale might require larger blocks, so steps 1+2 could make Bitcoin faster.
Step 2 alone, if feasible (I think it is), might be enough also, at least for a while.
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:07:59
Frankly, I cannot see the difference between a *blocksize steering committee* and a central bank, moreso when blatant rejection of fee market mechanisms leads to re the "arbitrary 21M limit" sooner than later (either that or leaving the chain insecure, which I think we will agree is a worse outcome).
On-chain spam (meaning transactions that are of little economical significance, if at all) do not make value, and instead hinder full nodes, to a point where one can no longer honestly call the system *p2p*.
Do not get me wrong: I totally agree that highly usable means-of-exchange functionality is absolutely necessary to keep the coin valuable. I just disagree that either BAB or BSV can achieve it, especially with their ascientific rejection of Segwit and Lightning, which provide superior payment system than old-style "push to address and wait for confirmations" (for most common types of payments at least).

Two lines where one is "The Bitcoin Core developers" and the other is "Bitcoin Developers" is silly, because you are referring to the same group of people in both. IANAL either, but I do not understand the change. Has somebody complained?
About "Bitcoin" vs. "Bitcoin Core", you cannot formally prove that any new release implements the Bitcoin protocol (meaning that it is bug-compatible with the previous releases, which constitute what is Bitcoin at least up to that point). In that line, *Bitcoin Core* (or for your case Bitcoin Knots, if you cannot guarantee bug-compatibility with Core) would make more sense than simply *Bitcoin*. This is, it centers the focus on authors of the software (Core) more than authors of the protocol (Bitcoin).

Ripple *ledgers* are blocks, and they are chained.

@_date: 2015-08-28 15:43:38


Because it is profitable. If you are a pool, getting rid of a 10% competition means more coins for you (especially when these miners will stop GBT / p2pool and point their hashing power to you).
Also, we have seen that pools trust each other and they build blocks on top of others' headers, so they minimize the orphaning rate.
@_date: 2015-08-25 11:36:35
Yes, it was properly an (unexpected) altcoin: The coins mined on that branch are worthless, and they still exist in that branch but cannot be spent on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-25 07:08:56
Yes, they are. Remember that in Dogecoin they hardforked to unlimited supply against the best interest of HODLers.
The economic actors are rationally incetivized to support the most secure chain (this is why altchains have not gone anywhere and was one of the motivations of your sidechains proposal).
In case of a contentious split, unless it is evenly balanced, miners on the longest chain can coordinate to attack the shorter chain (concretely, in the 75-25 XT-Core case, XT pools would have three times as much hashing power) and thus win back any resisting economic support on it. Value would of course fall sharply because of the loss of confidence, but the system may probably survive.
Incidentally, I recall that you once used your hashing power to kill a scamcoin (thanks for that btw!). I am aware that that case was somewhat different because it was merge-mining and you did not coordinate (AFAIK) the attack with others, but this does not alter much the aforementioned point.

Both Hal and Satoshi seem to be good coders. Code comparison is really hard because it has little flexibility and style is often fixed by rules specific to the project.
Hal was one of the few cypherpunks working in digital money before Bitcoin. It looks like he believed in the project from the beginning. In my opinion, a rather remarkable evidence that Hal was Satohshi / part of the Satoshi collective is the fact that he lived in the same town as Dorian Nakamoto and he probably knew him. Even if Dorian was probably never involved at all, Hal could have been inspired by Dorian's Japanese name when he chose the pseudonym *Satoshi Nakamoto*. Or maybe all this was just a coincidence; rare things happen by chance sometimes.
@_date: 2015-08-05 16:23:57
It is clear enough for me: Bigger guys can always afford better connectivities in their area.
Today, as I mentioned, **the reward expectation is linear with the hashing power**. This implies that any centralization forces are of a secondary order. However, if connectivity becomes a limiting factor, this is no longer the case and modest miners are forced to either mind blindly or be at disadvantage.

Brainwallets are fundamentally bad because brains usually produce poor, guessable randomness. Some key stretching does not change this. It just makes cracking slower / more expensive, but still accessible given enough computing power.
Bitcoin private keys are 256-bit-long and so have 128-bit complexity. Brainwallets have around 40 and this level of key stretching provides the equivalent of ~10 extra bit, i.e., still far from what they should be.
Secondarily, WarpWallet outputs the inefficient uncompressed keys, which are rather obsolete today.

What censorship? I have had no problems finding this flaming thread in the front page...
@_date: 2015-08-30 12:53:15
Thanks for answering, Peter.
My point about that was that once nearly everyone does SPV mining then that small-block-racer situation would be extremely rare. 
The small-block miner that produced it is taking a huge risk, because competing miners could find a (presumably empty) block over the previously announced header before they validate her small block. On the other hand, if she SPV mines instead on top of the announce header, it will be easier that the block gets accepted as there is no race at all (plus this consolidates the previous, huge block). This is thus the optimal strategy.
Headers of a multi-block chain from known, reputable pools are nearly as trustable as single blocks, as long as the trailing blocks are empty or contain only newly seen transactions. Eventually, everything gets validated and the network synchronizes (we know that for Bitcoin to reach Byzantine consensus, the propagation time should be on average much shorter than the block time).
@_date: 2015-08-17 13:33:37
Yes, we need fraud proofs. Ideally, UTXO commitments on headers too.
Then maybe we can fully delegate validation and specialize full nodes like we have specialized mining.
@_date: 2015-08-12 08:28:38


No. I did not say that. What I am afraid is that the 25% might just leave instead of accepting the new rule-changing chain.
If the original subnetwork persists in coexisting after a few days, with only 25% of the previous hash rate, then the XT pools could coordinate to attack it and kill it.

Notice also that this is not how tradeable IOUs work in the real world. The secondary market where they trade, but not the issuer, can freeze assets after justice intervention.

 - There are rogue pools [out there]( They attack the network at a global level, but they are much profitable from a personal point of view (and there might be a Tragedy of the Commons situation with them).
 - These are not just theoretical attacks. There has been at least one case where a transaction with 15 confirmations [got successfully reversed]( While this one took place in an exceptional situation, I think that it proves that shorter double spendings should not be considered impossible with the more regular 1-block reorganizations. **We know that miners use rather diverse mempool policies.**

It is quite different. Hidden Wallet relies on the availability of other transactors of similar size at the same time. CT, on the contrary, fully blinds what is being sent, so no mixing is actually necessary - it is mainly for enhanced performance (at least as long as it is not 1 input 1 output).

Because it changes the game from "it pays off to steal, if you have a direct link with a miner" (as when Ghash pool was robbing Satoshi Dice) to "it does not pay off to steal in any case, everyone loses, so it never happens in the first place".
And, anyway, good or not, it is inevitable, because Bitcoin does not depend on honor, and any state when somebody does not maximize profits is suboptimal and thus **guaranteed** to eventually change. 
All this has been empirically tested along the years: Whenever the p2p network tends to enforce the suboptimal, pools like Ghash and Bitundo pop in, which make the situation significantly worse.

The only problem that I see with your definition is that it is too distinct from the one widely used now. There are plenty of SHA256 coins out there, and many of these actually self-define as altcoins.
But, yes, it makes sense in a way. Especially, because you cannot really tell what a miner is running when it adds a block. E.g., a block that claims to be from XT could be mined by the programmed-to-fork XT, by the non-forking [notbitcoinxt]( or even SPV-mined.

We do not know yet.
But one of the best hypotheses I have heard of is that their cold wallet got emptied through malleability with private-key sweeping.

@_date: 2015-08-30 21:59:45
It should be possible and, in my view, also desirable, and not just a sporadic commit but a UTXO commit at every block. That said, notice that this does not avoid having to download the blockchain for full validation, as the security is not the same. With full validation, a 51% attack can only censor your transactions. In this *stronger*-SPV case, the attacker can make you think you own zero (or, if everyone does the same validation and not the stronger one, effectively make you own zero). 
The hybrid that you propose, 5-year-old UTXO commit + 5 years of block validation, should be strong enough for everyone so that the network can effectively *ignore* older validation. This can be thought as a relocation of the genesis block, only that a little less elegant. Even at much shorter periods, the risk of reorganization is negligible.
@_date: 2015-08-27 22:54:59

You are probably confused about the **thought experiment** on *it is 2070 and powerful quantum computers can now crack coins for which the public key is known, what would happen?*. In that scenario, holders that still have the keys will probably move their coins to quantum-resistant outputs, but lost coins would be left vulnerable and "mined" as they get cracked. 
Since that would have unexpected, undesired economical consequences, some proposed that we would need to properly delete those old outputs if there is consensus for such thing (i.e., c.2060, when we are widely confident that everyone with existing keys would have already moved to quantum-resistant or at least sha256² protected).

Bootstrapping from the Bitcoin blockchain at a certain point of time is not that unusual: Clams and Aethereum (the fork of Ethereum) use it. Single-rule forks are not unknown either: Bytecoin BTE is exactly Bitcoin but with a different genesis.
That said, I disagree that XT should be called an altcoin at this stage. It is just a risky node: It is unsafe to use because it could eventually show as valid a blockchain state not accepted by others (i.e., a state different from Bitcoin's), and it is risky to mine with as it is anything that could eventually split out a 25% of the network in an instant (the value of the proceeds of that mining would certainly fall in that event) .

My point is that by disabling long chains you immediately free up 50% of the space. This is a huge gain. Few CPFP are chains longer than 10, and most of the times they are 2 tx long. If you want to save CPFP, you could trivially find a canonical ordering with a max length of 2 (or something). But I think that disabling it would add pressure to better support RBF, which is more efficient.
CPFP is wrong; you add a new transaction for every bump. In a bidding war where transactors only can do CPFP, block space gets exhausted in "replaced" transactions down the chain (and the fee needs to cover all of them). CPFP limited to 2 (with the 2nd transaction being RBFed eventually) mitigates that problem, but still reinforces the bad habit of sending with no fee and having the receiver pay for it, which doubles the size of payments.


Most of the time it is Coinbase sending to Coinbase, so they can well replace it and still charge a fee to two (or more) customers.

The truthcoin guy [recently explained Ricardian rent in a rather pedagogical way](
Since investors are free to either buy bitcoins directly or invest in mining operations, the operation costs of the least efficient miner left will necessarily equal the market exchange rate of the bitcoins that it produces (altruistic mining might exist, but I would bet that it is insignificant in hashing power in front of so many large scale operations). The rent approaches zero. The fact that these prices are non-stationary does not matter either as long as they are locally balanced (i.e., arbitrage might persist but only at a secondary order).
What efficient miners do with their profits is irrelevant. This is because they can sell for fiat profit or reinvest in their mining operation, or alternatively keep the bitcoins if that is marginally preferable to them.

It is quite clear that many NYA signers want replay protection. It is incredible because we have already learned, from experience, what happens when there is no replay protection: The ETH/ETC case was a shitstorm. On top of that, the number of BTC users today is orders of magnitude the number of ETH users back then, and in ETH splitting was easy via a branch-aware smart-contract, which is unavailable in BTC.

Yeah, I would bet that the share of fixed operation costs is usually much higher than the rate of invalid blocks. If you can assume this, then you would mine on top of the non-validated block instead of waiting, as you said.

@_date: 2015-08-17 16:25:36
You are right, and this concept is often misunderstood.
First, only miners matter, not the other nodes, as they are the ones building the blockchain.
Yet not even miners really "vote". Consensus is a rather binary thing: We either have it (single blockchain with exponentially distributed reorgs) or we do not (multiple coexisting blockchains with incompatible rules; e.g., even if one has 20x the difficulty of the other as a result of a 95-5 schism). 
There is no "democratic election" nor a "let the market decide" situation. If there is consensus, there is a universal decentralized ledger. If there is not, then there is insecurity over the future, no reliable store of value and ultimately no value at all (sure old bitcoins still exist in both chains, but Bitcoin is a living system and so if new investment stops its value falls).
Fortunately, the Nash equilibrium is thus to keep consensus. This, headless (Byzantine fault tolerant) consensus, is what makes Bitcoin a honeybadger. And then from this we can conclude that unilateral hardforks, like XT, are either irrational or an alt-chain.
@_date: 2015-08-14 00:18:22
I was not clear enough: I was thinking of the reduced privacy (and the security issues derived from that loss) of having only the same few Lightning nodes available for certain recurrent payments. But I am aware that this is just hypothetical at this stage (hopefully, once fully deployed, there would be plenty of equally cheap alternative routes for nearly every payment).
I know that Lightning is more secure than the base layer in the sense that it offers instant payments, with the only risk of temporal locking.

I am quite optimistic about the future, but I am opposed to such aggressive jumps into the void of unknown technologies. Technology is ultimately limited by Physics and we do not know if it could ever reach that point you mention, even theoretically (I presume you are not supposed to have a broadband fiber link plugged in your toaster).
Both Nature and History have shown that exponential growth is unsustainable and short lived. Extrapolation of an exponential growth over a long time scale is something that would blush nearly every experimental scientist.
Not only this, but also the assumed rate of exponential growth (doubling every other year) is an unrealistic expectation from the one observed in the past (compare it with sipa's data-based 17% pa projection).

I like to see Bitcoin as more than just one particular chain. Bitcoins are money and as such they stay the same even when they take different forms. Bitcoins in a trustless off-chain network are still bitcoins because they can go from/back to the blockchain at 1:1 equivalence and at any time. The same for bitcoins on sidechains.
It is often discussed why Bitcoin will still be there (and valuable) in a few decades. For this, it needs to be able to evolve and incorporate changes that made competitors advantageous. Many of these changes can be implemented directly in the protocol (through softforks, even hardforks). But even further than this, the blockchain itself can evolve. This is what sidechains make possible. 
As you say, it is possible that a sidechain takes over the original chain. In this case, Bitcoin will be the new chain and pegging will ensure that this happens without disruption. Notice also that there is not any concept of hierarchy in sidechains; they are each side-by-side equivalent and they can transfer tokens between each other by means of compact SPV proofs.

Please do not confuse things. Many people here support a larger block limit. They just want it implemented in a way that does not divide the community in two. 
I have seen no censorship whatsoever about bigger block proposals here.
Bitcoin XT is a completely different case. It is a software, solely under Gavin's control, that can roll out a contentious change of rules, one that is incompatible with every other current implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. 
From this perspective, the mod policy here makes sense: BitcoinXT implements all consensus rules except one. It is therefore as off-topic as Bytecoin BTE, the exact clone, which also implements all the Bitcoin consensus rules except one (that of the genesis block).
@_date: 2015-07-17 09:15:56
What you propose is perfectly possible, has already been proposed and it only requires a soft fork: 
In this proposal, the regular blocks stay like in the present and there would be *extended* blocks that can be as large as wanted. Nodes and miners can validate both blocks or just the regular ones (this avoids most of the risks associated with sidechains). The bitcoins are 1:1 pegged between the regular and the extended blocks, so they stay essentially the same; there is no dilution from network effects.

@_date: 2015-08-10 15:01:34
Yes, we agree on that.
There is much benevolence right now in mining. Selfish mining, withholding attacks to pools and rogue pools like BitUndo are all profitable. Yet, they are not widely used. Maybe we could remove the block size limit and the fitter miners would not abuse their advantage against the small ones. However, we cannot take any of these behaviors for granted.
Frankly, mining is evolving really fast. Something scares me about the next halving reward. When the last halving happened, mining was still quite a hobby thing. The hash rate did not significantly drop because most miners kept mining at a loss, for the collective good, and then a rallying price quickly pushed the hash rate again. The next halving, however, will see a much different context. A lot of the hash rate will suddenly become costly unprofitable and might shut down. The difficulty may drop and, if the price does not jump quickly (unclear, since speculation volume is orders of magnitude larger than miners' sellings) then the network could be attackable.
Contradictorily, a key weakness of the current situation in which most mining is pooled and pools have visible, non-anonymous heads, could end up saving the day if pools coordinate against an attack. My biggest hope for the future of Bitcoin lies in the fact that pool coordination against an attack seems likelier than coordination for establishing censorship or limiting fungibility.

This would typically happen when there are deep ideological divides, which I do not see here.
The proposal is quite absurd and not much meritorious IMHO: It introduces a second limit (there has not been size limit for the last year and a half) which easily leads to incentive mess and, in some circumstances, make impossible a proper fee market.
We are not observing either any hard reduction in number of nodes that could justify stress due to excessive size. Also, with its trade-offs, assumevalid already permits reasonably fast IBD even on lowend hardware.
The only positive that I see in it is that it could force faster adoption of LN, albeit with the stick, not with the carrot.

You seem to be using a definition of *cryptocurrency* that is very much different from the one commonly used here in this forum. Anyway, XRP does not fit quite well the definition of *currency* or at least much worse than Bitcoin, Litecoin or Dogecoin. In particular:
It is not a unit of account. Despite being 2nd or 3rd or 4th on CMC, there exist very few examples where prices are expressed in XRP.
It is a poor mean of transfer. The vast majority of exchanges take place inside the orderbooks, so that there is only a nominal transfer in terms of balances; no actual XRP gets transactionally involved. Even in rippled and autobridged transactions inside the Ripple system, XRP takes a secondary role and is rarely the asset being transfered.
It is a very poor store of value. The majority of the 100B supply is still in the hands of the founders, 20B personally and the rest through the company. Jed alone has 9B, and he left to found the competing Stellar Lumens. Against Bitcoin at least, the current price is less than 1/3 of what it was right after launch five years ago.

I think that the word *peg* might be confusing you here. It has nothing to do with fiat-currency pegs that often require liquidity pools and active policing.
In this context, pegging means that you lock a token in one chain and you programmatically get access to a fully equivalent token on the other chain. It is automatic, uncensorable and fast, and it goes two way. Software could use both seamlessly. Therefore there is no reason why their exchange rate would not be 1:1.
The same is true for Lightning channels. You lock the tokens in a channel and you transact them off-chain at 1:1 equivalence. They are still *bitcoins* in every practical sense.
It is just like the balance that you transfer to your account in a centralized exchange.

Pooled mining is p2pool and GBT, and both effectively require full validation.
If you do not build blocks, you do not mine. You are selling your hashing power to someone else in exchange for a reward.
@_date: 2015-08-29 21:49:40
Nice analysis.
I am still unconvinced about the orphaning costs in the current real context, though. Primarily, I find that your paper (and also Peter R's) address poorly these concerns:
 - Most blocks are mined by big, reputable pools. Other miners identify them and they start mining on top of their headers as soon as they are announced and before downloading the blocks (SPV mining). In most cases, it is profitable to do this. If generalized, this practice makes the orphaning rate insignificant and, most importantly, size independent.
 - Big miners can easily coordinate their mempool policies and then quickly synchronize the blocks (through IBLT or other means) without having to download them. In a situation with blacklists and censored transactions used by big cartels, smaller independent miners would be at disadvantage, i.e., orphaning would be highly asymmetric.
 - The expected reward from the block subsidy grows linearly with the hashing power and so there is no centralizing force for it. However, once we consider connectivity, big, better connected miners have an advantage over the less connected (because they self-limit at larger sizes and so earn more fees): It is no longer linear and ultimately the small guys are forced out or, at least, to sell their hashing power to a stratum pool.
 - Related to the previous point: Selfish mining and bitundo are profitable at the individual level. Both strategies benefit more the larger miners, and both are more profitable with increased propagation friction.

Why do you require 81% to reduce the limit?
Let us suppose that miners have imprudently raised the limit too much. Then, a big miner starts profiting from it by filling blocks with spurious transactions and doing a selfish mining attack (which we know can be profitable at any rate when propagation taken into account). Why do we need 81% to lower it? The selfish miner alone could be controlling more than 21%.
Yes, I am aware that a 51% can softfork out the high voting miners, but it is unclear how this major collusion could spontaneously emerge. Furthermore, if there are two big selfish miners, then honest non-selfish miners are probably below 51%.

I could not disagree more with your "Pro". I would say that nearly everyone in the debate agrees that the capacity needs to be increased; the discussion is on how to do it. One side proposes to do it on-chain, through larger blocks (to a significantly larger capacity than today, but still far from global-adoption scale that would require unrealistic gigabyte-sized blocks). The other side proposes to do it off-chain, through channels that get eventually settled on the blockchain. And still, in the middle, Adam Back proposes a third approach consisting of "larger" extended blocks that would require just a softfork instead of a hardfork.
Most of us agree that the ideal solution for reaching a global-scale-of-transactions level will necessarily involve both larger blocks and off-chain methods. From my view, the blocksize debate is about how much of the one and how much of the other would make the right compromise.

Oh, thanks.
But no, the off-chain channels are not necessarily centralized. Centralized ones could be used for very specific cases, like maybe changetip or the faucetbox. For the rest of the transactions, I would love to see *decentralized* channels like the Lightning network or fidelity-bonded anonymous Chaumian banks.

This is not that far fetched.
This is happening right now with Ripple: It was supposed to be a permissionless system based on web-of-trust. Unfortunately, it did not stay much decentralized and now it has fallen prey of regulatory capture: The dev team has been fined, forced to register as an MSB (because they auctioned their premined tokens) and every user is required to pass KYC verification just to be able to run an open-source software. RIP Ripple.
Could this happen with BitcoinXT? Probably not with 8MB blocks, but if definitely could with larger ones. Even sub-gigabyte blocks would require that nodes are run in rather large, visible facilities. Chinese and Icelandic miners would outsource block building to these. We could easily end with 51% of nodes in America and Europe, and then it would just take a bilateral treaty to end with Bitcoin.
I really hope that the community rejects BitcoinXT and that we come to an agreement on how to scale the block sizes. The government has been already watching for a while and they will take any opportunity to destroy us (read, make us *compliant*). Worryingly, XT's lead Gavin thinks that we should collaborate with them  :

Miners are the ones securing the network so it is important that they can chose the fees (this will be especially important when the subsidy fades out). But if there is plenty of block space, there is a race to the bottom to include anything that pays a positive fee. On the other hand, if there is too little space, users can move to cheaper, competing solutions. 
Since it is hard to know it advance the good limit, and individual incentives are not enough, it makes sense to let miners collectively choose a limit.
Syndicates / cartels will surely form with the objective to coordinate for setting that limit. This is not necessarily as bad as it may sound; in particular, it is much safer than making them choose between Core and XT. Additionally, the limit set is defined so that it needs at least 80% support (and this could be raised to say 90% to be extra safe). Still, this alone could be used to progressively push towards centralization, but because of this, there are two additional safeguards: maximum 2x change per interval and a hard maximum and 32 MB.
Actually, Jeff explains all that in the PDF, with greater detail.

Here *instant* means *fast compared to the synchronization period* (10' average).


An enjoyable reading, thanks! (btw no, I am not one of the  authors; they look quite clearly smarter than me). Apparently, they somewhat generalize Miller's results and, in particular, they provide a figure for safety under an homogeneous latency (or for its worst case, as a boundary). In the desynchronization limit i.e., the one where the propagation rate approaches the block rate, an attacker with ~38% of the hashing rate can succeed.
On the other hand, yes, I think that we agree in that decentralization involves more than this.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:10:01
In a strict sense (but probably not in practice) he was right. Bitcoin's security assurance comes from the fact that there is no incentive in going from 51% to 52% hashrate, and so there is an economic pressure to avoid a 51% attack. The existence of selfish mining changes this, because with it there is an advantage from 34% and all the way up to 51% (and with network control it is even less than 34%). This is not unreasonable, because economies of scale may well push one single miner past 34%.
Now, why in practice this does not happen: The issue is that big pools are public and identifiable, and they even try to build a reputation (ahem, Jihan, ahem). There is social pressure that prevents a selfish mining attack, while there is still some anonymous hashrate left to prevent from censorship.

In the [fine against Ripple]( it got quite clear that, for FinCEN, it is not just the gateways that require a license but also the developers of the software. This implies, bizarrely, that users of the software need to get KYCed.
Colored coins or OpenTransactions could be an exception if they are implemented in an anonymous way (e.g., fidelity bonds).
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:41:42
Not necessarily. For a selfish miner that has 1/3 of the hashing power or more, she gains from withholding even if she loses every propagation race.
For smaller miners, it might still be profitable, depending on how fast go the propagations.

`ssh`has a similar problem: It shows hex fingerprints before connecting, which are very difficult to recognize or compare. As a partial solution, they added a 2D digest called *randomart* that is more human friendly.  This solution is far from ideal because visual similarity could still be exploited, but it protects against most opportunistic attacks.

No, not easier at all. Increasing the block size requires global consensus; it even could be argued to somewhat alter the social contract (in the sense of being able to run a fully validating node on ordinary hardware).
On the other hand, FSS-RBF is part of the mempool policy and does not  really require any global consensus, nor a majority of the hashing power.
If only a decent minority of the miners implement FSS-RBF, then the replacement txs will eventually get confirmed, in case their firs-seen counterparts are stuck.

Only that Metcalfe's Law will imply that the sum of the resulting coins would be less than the original utility.
@_date: 2015-08-17 09:17:45
Because it is not that simple: There is a large block size at which orphan rate is still reasonably small but that it forces small miners out, i.e., it makes a smaller set (the fittest majority) to share the rewards. The 1MB softfork get through because mining was a hobby back then. Today, big, reasonably connected miners might reject to impose a smaller limit if this implies more competition.
In particular, there is a point where well connected pools -maybe helped with SPV mining- mine large blocks without significant orphaning, but GBT and p2pool become nearly infeasible.
@_date: 2015-08-15 07:36:12
It is a non-issue in the case of pooled mining, because a 51% attack is very visible and pooling miners that value their investments will immediately move their hashrate away.
However, a more dangerous scenario is that of the *benevolent monopolist* by an entity that owns the 51% of the hashrate. In this hypothetical case, competing miners desist because the monopolist rejects their blocks and so they would be wasting their money. The monopolist respects the rules and Bitcoin stays valuable, until a point where it gets regulatory captured and implements (willingly or forcedly) some sort of blacklisting for tainted coins. At this point, Bitcoin would still be a working payment system for most, but not better than an energy-wasteful version of Paypal.

Yes. The problem with sending to the eater address (or similar) is that the coins are not technically burnt.

In addition, because these proofs of burn are technically spendable, they pollute the UTXO database. This is why the *preferable* way of burning is through OP_RETURN.

Thanks for the explanation. So the problem that you have with OP's statement is actually in the "stock market money **moves to** Bitcoin" part. Yes, you are right there.
This is not how I understood it though (not at first sight at least). I do not think that the OP was literally speculating on what would happen if stock owners would sell 1% of their holdings and then buy Bitcoin with the money that they got from that. I think that he was just comparing the two figures, in which, indeed, a (less than) tripling of current market capitalization (defined as current BTC supply multiplied by the current USD exchange rate) would equal one hundredth of US stock market capitalization.
So is this that relevant in practice? Probably yes, at least in some cases. Personally, for me, spot_rate x btc_I_own determines e.g., how much I could invest in places like simplefx or, in case of urgent necessity, up to how much I would be covered without getting indebted (I can cashout entirely without slippage).

Heavy regulation can have varied implications. I mentioned an example:


Sure this type of regulation will accommodate banks and financial institutions. My argument is that, at this point we just do not need mining and we can instead have a regulatory board that decides which transactions get included in the blockchain (this can be made fully programmable, like today, with the current script + an extra rule that involves decentralized blacklists). Also, the regulatory board would use a multisig scheme to avoid central points of failure.
Does BTC stay valuable in this scenario, just because it is scarce? I do not know. BTC in this case is not that different from private bank monies, which were popular in the past but eventually became worthless, or maybe it would behave like bank IOUs, whose value can range from money-like to worthless.

*Peak gold* is near, if not already behind us. Higher prices can only slightly increase the mining rate (past some point, it costs exponentially more to extract and process faster).

Chain information cannot be split because nodes cannot guarantee that they will be available in the future. Redundancy cannot be made 100% safe. If some information is stored in only a handful of nodes and all these disappear, then the safety of the whole gets affected. You could think about increasing the redundancy requirement, like saying that every piece needs to be in 1/5 of the nodes, but nodes are anonymous to each other and they are not able to reliably coordinate (without trust) to such split.
Therefore, the safe bet is that every node has everything. This way, even if your connectivity degrades to the point where it is just another node (e.g., a BitSat satellite), you can still validate the blocks and stay safe.
That said, there is something that nodes can do to avoid storing the full chain. After processing the blocks, they can *prune* them and just keep a list of coins left unspent. They are no longer *full nodes* as they cannot serve old transactions to others, but they still operate with full validation.

The reduction in security and privacy of SPV is somewhat comparable to the one with off-chain channels.
Strictly speaking, Luke is right: If you do not verify the rules, you cannot be sure on whether what you have is Bitcoin or something else.
However, I like to think of Bitcoin as the greater ecosystem, which includes the trustless channels, the trusted ones (e.g., tipping), SPV and trusted delegation of validation, Bitcoin banks (invasive or Chaumian), and similar. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 11:26:51
I see, and I stand corrected. 
SPV mining (no validation at all of the block contents) is attacking the network. What you mention is validating, but start mining without waiting for it.
But is it really profitable? If the block is invalid, you would have wasted electricity (and lengthened an invalid subchain). I would guess it depends on the fixed costs and the probability of receiving invalid blocks.
@_date: 2015-08-05 17:26:59

Meaningfully pool mining requires keeping your operation honest, be certain that the pool is trust free, that it cannot rob you or attack Bitcoin in a way that undermines its value (i.e., that of your mining output). P2Pool has these features, but it requires a full node.

The main risk is that the devs can push (in some cases, *salami* style, to avoid schisms) the protocol in a direction that goes against the will of the (economic) majority of users.
Let me insist in the Ripple example: I am pretty certain that a majority of its users did not want the current blacklisting process (transaction freeze, forced KYC procedure, etc.), yet they have been forced to it through the protocol's central point of failure. Consider that Ripple is used already today by a dozen of banks and many other financial institutions, yet its internal token of value (premined scamcoin, if you want) has a market capitalization that is less than an order of magnitude smaller than that of Bitcoin.
In my view, the Bitcoin network **needs** a few miners that, maybe will be small and inefficient, but can stay anonymous and fly under the radar, and append uncensored blocks to the chain. If not, we will end up with nothing more than with another PayPay or VISA, and the value of bitcoin will be less than the one that would have a free-floating, backed-by-nothing visacoin or paypalcoin.

@_date: 2015-08-24 08:52:42
Not really! For BIP66, miners had actually implemented the change for transactions in their mempool, they were just not validating the previous blocks (not even the headers!). So when an invalid block appeared, they just kept adding blocks on top of it instead of orphaning it.
Anyway, your point is valid: Miners could have been lying for any soft- and hardfork, and we really have no way to know it before the fact.

"Bitcoin is not incompatible with big government" is in the same line of "bigger blocks are preferable for mass adoption as long as some degree of decentralization prevails", and "mining behind tor is not a *sine qua non* objective", and even "proof of stake is not fundamentally flawed and could be rolled in some day" (not literal quotes).
I would say that Gavin sees Bitcoin as a monetary liberator that is most useful if massively adopted, even if this implies a small degree of concession on its strength. I agree that we need something with that role, though I fear that Bitcoin could then fell prey of regulatory capture (e.g., as it happened with Ripple) if we technically suppress the possibility of some anonymous mining.
In that case, maybe, we could keep the regulators distracted while we develop and deploy a *stronger* liberator within Bitcoin like fidelity-bound anonymous Chaumian banks, ring-signed transactions to stealth addresses, or similar.

No. All the pre-2014 coins are effectively dead (litecoin still somewhat lingers, but at much less return and much more volatility than bitcoin), and new shitcoins keep appearing every year, replacing the previous ones (e.g., Libra seems to cover all the Ether and EOS use cases). 
Therefore, alts are not good for holding.
So what is left then, selling the top? Nearly nobody sells the top though, because you only notice that it was the top time after the fact. What is left, in practice, is negative-sum wealth transfer from one speculator to the other.

It will not be called like that. 
The limited supply is untouchable. However, future security is still an unsolved problem and economic theory shows that unless there is block space competition, fees will not effectively substitute the block subsidy. Someone could defend that we nominally keep the 21M but we introduce a very small demurrage (maybe as small as 0.1% pa) as a form of an *enforced* [hashing assurance contract](

Seriously: I am quite optimistic for the future. I think that we will overcome the surveillance State, that Bitcoin will ultimately succeed and that technological advancements (both soft- and hardware alike; the Internet, computing and robotics) will bring us a more equal and just society. I also think that space exploration can literally bloom, limited to the solar system.
But asteroid mining at any significant scale is something I find really stupid, more the more I read about it. For the vast majority of rare elements, it will always be more profitable (energy wise) to extract the tiny particles from the ocean than to go fetch them from million-kilometer distances. It is something that involves bringing to space (which has a cost of dozen thousand dollars per kilogram) what is probably among the heaviest machinery on Earth. Like constructing the Gibraltar dam (a much modest objective in comparison), it is something that is not physically impossible, but not something for this century or the next.

Bitcoin main virtue is Byzantine fault tolerance. It is this what makes it uncensorable, trustless, permissionless and ultimately decentralized. However, such tolerance is guaranteed only under two rather strong assumptions, namely instant propagation of messages and absence of an attacker (Byzantine faulty agent) with a majority of the hashing power. 
In other words, Bitcoin is anti-fragile only as long as we can ensure a not-that-robust assumption.
The system is probably safe in the current conditions with 1MB blocks. It would most likely stay still in the safe regime with 8MB blocks. But there is clearly a limit that breaks it (on the order of 100MB? - difficult to know). This is why the base protocol cannot directly scale to a global payment system right now.

There is a value in your proposal, even if it is not directly enforceable (we are not going to introduce code compiling as a consensus rule, and there is no way to know that the committed code is the one actually run unless we require trusted computing validation).
Even if it is only indicational, voting approaches like yours or prediction markets [as proposed recently]( can help avoiding a consensus schism, which is the worst case scenario.

As for zerocoin: the fact that it requires a trusted setup is a show stopper. 
There is a solution for this: zerocash, but it does not work with Bitcoin and it requires its own (side-)chain.

How I would do it.
First, is it theoretically possible? I think that it is. If you have seen many randomart like me, you know that they all *look different* but not *radically different*. I could probably reliably distinguish one in thousands, but probably not one in millions. This is why I said that its *effective* complexity might be in the 10-15 bit range.
Now, to do it in practice gets more involved: visual similarity is not easily defined. I have not tried it, but machine learning could probably help here (with shapes of the elements and their positions as input). Once properly trained, the similarity calculation can be fast (i.e., faster than the hashing; not limiting) especially if we use look up tables or similar tricks.
@_date: 2015-07-22 09:26:53
Yes, we need to get rid of blocksize scarcity. You have convinced me. Let us the small, inefficient miners die; even if all mining concentrates in large datacenters, this is still preferable to having to use off-chain solutions (even decentralized ones: the primordial thing is to stick with Satoshi's original genius vision).
But removing the blocksize cap **is not enough**! Blocksize scarcity is only a part of the problem. The other major obstacle hindering mass adoption is *supply* scarcity. A hard-coded central-planned 21M, wtf? There will never be enough for everyone. Also, if we scale it up with adoption, the exchange rate with fiat might even get more stable!
Let us fork Bitcoin Core now and get rid of these two absurd, crippling caps that only serve our competition (Blockstream and co).

A majority of Bitcoin-related malware tries to steal the private keys. In this case, the private keys never leave the hardware wallet, so they cannot be stolen.
Malware or a remote controlling attacker can still alter the transactions before they are sent to the hardware wallet. As a protection, hardware wallets have a small display where they show the amount and destination address.
However, this is not a perfect protection. When the computer is fully owned, the attacker can mutate every Bitcoin address and QR code displayed for her own.
Also, an attacker with enough computing power (concretely, RIPEMD hashing power) can craft an address that is visually similar enough to the target one and substitute it within seconds. Human eyes are poor recognizers of random-looking strings of text.

It did not. ~~Addresses are a relatively new thing.~~ Back then you would pay to pubkeys or even, oddly enough, to IP addresses (through ephemeral pubkeys).

The main problem that I see with Bitcoin-XT is that even a 75-25 split can be considered a **fail** for both sub-networks: Metcalfe's law suggests that the value of Bitcoin-XT would almost halve (0.75^2 ~ 0.56). And probably a death sentence for the Bitcoin concept in general (in the sense that consensus rules could be changed even if contentious so, e.g., at some point miners could reject one of the reward halvings; this happened with Dogecoin).

Maybe s/he confused it with the other *bytecoin*, the one that is an exact clone but with an alternative genesis? (it is a joke, because it is implying that bitcoin is already OK so no need for an alt).

@_date: 2015-07-26 12:38:16
Me neither. But even if it is just theoretical at this point, it looks certainly feasible. Furthermore, a rogue node doing that could easily stay undetected/unblockable (even if double spends start being relayed).
Fortunately, nonce reuse does not happen *that* often, but you are right that there is no reason to get exposed to this risk if avoidable.
Since people will go on posting static addresses, I think that what we need is the only way of safely doing it: *stealth addresses*.

No, it was a softfork. The capped blocks where fully back-compatible.
I enjoyed your argumentation, but I am still not convinced that it is a "bug". There are clearly *too large* limits in which, if miners fail to correctly self-regulate, we would end up with an even more centralized network. There are also *too small* limits that block lots of legitimate transactions and may not even be enough to settle all the off-chain channels.
I think that the issue needs still more debate (as technical as possible, for political diversity is here to stay and should not be blocking) until both sides reach a compromise.
@_date: 2017-04-12 12:10:18
Well, this is probably true for most BU nodes too. I mean, all those that suspiciously did not crash on any of the two successive DoS bugs last month ;)
@_date: 2017-04-29 07:33:39
That each node eventually reaches the same state, bug by bug and edge-case by edge-case. In the absence of formal verification, this needs that every implementation runs the same consensus-critical code (parity-bitcoin does not).
This is not elegant and requires a *reference implementation*, but the alternative is uglier and actually impossible in a decentralized system. Notably, Ethereum has a high-level specification instead of a reference implementation, and this implies that Vitalik decides which subchain is canonical: There was a consensus split a few months ago between geth and parity. Vitalik concluded that while both implementations were incorrect, he judged that parity's was "closer" to the specification (whatever that means) and consequently the network reorganized around it. Deep-confirmed double spending could have been possible.

Standard bitcoin transactions have one or more "from" addresses, but not necessarily.
Bitcoin transactions spend some inputs and lock the same quantity (less fees) to outputs. These outputs (UTXOs) are script-locked puzzles. Some of them are addresses, like pubkey hashes --the 1-addresses-- or script hashes --the 3-addresses--, some of them are not.
When you spend an output that is e.g., spendable by anyone or by providing a pubkey or a complex script construct, there is no "from" address.

Yes. All single-address wallets have security and privacy issues and should be avoided.
BIP38 was developed at a time where people used brain wallets, which got regularly hacked. The idea was not bad: Combine "something I know" with "something I have", in which a key derivation function produced the Bitcoin private key from a computer-generated seed and a brain-produced key. This is the *strong* BIP38 mode.
Later, and quite idiotically, the authors added a second mode with symmetric encryption, for encrypting existing keys. This is the mode that is failing in Bippy. This is bad because it tries to add a completely different use case to the same BIP standard and, more importantly, because it reinvents the wheel, as we already have well established tools for symmetrically encrypting arbitrary text.

I do not think that scarcity is more important than *honeybadgerness*. Experience shows that, even if scarce, a censurable or permissioned crypto coin is effectively worthless (e.g., look at Ripple).
Also, stating simply a "21 million limit" is not enough to ensure scarcity. With fading block subsidy and absence of transaction fee pressure, miners could attempt a hardfork that nominally leaves the 21 million limit but introduces a demurrage (maybe just at a tiny rate) that funds a permanent block reward. This would both keep the nominal coin limit and simultaneously unlimit the supply. 
Actually, some are already [seriously proposing transaction fee alternatives]( that are either non-enforced charity donations (probably ineffective for Bitcoin; look at how tiny are node-support or p2pool donations) or enforced as an effective demurrage.

In particular, in will not leak your MPK to anyone and it will leak nothing to the author. Potential privacy issue: it queries Blockr with your current addresses, through HTTPS.

But there are 1800 fresh bitcoins every day; so you can actually have sellers (miners) who have never bought before. Also, those are bitcoins, not dollars, so dollar amount needed to cover that rises as exchange price rises.
More fundamentally, you are saying that, because of leverage, the number of people interested in buying bitcoin will increase (in the end, there are as many buys as sells; it is just fiat changing hands and bitcoins changing hands). However, you do not justify why would this be the case.

I somewhat disagree with other commenters. Yes, true that Bitcoin is technically superior and also socially superior to its imitators, but this is not what matters the most. It is not its Lindy effect (Namecoin has nearly as much as Bitcoin), nor its Network effect (Facebook-coin would have more), nor not even its Focal point effect (hypothetical Segwit3x sanctioned by Wlad and GMax could capture that), no. 
We could have a sidechain with rich statefulness and muh governance, effectively centralized, and it would be OK, because it preserves **digital scarcity**, this is, the 21M limit. However, accepting any alt or fork as "legitimate" and thus valuable, corrupts that scarcity or, in other words, undoes the very property that makes the token have fundamental value in the first place.

A single node can easily bridge nearly all the transactions, and you can easily bridge two nodes via RPC or even via CLI. In the ETH/ETC case there was no API for raw transactions at that time, and they still got automatically replayed by third parties.

I would argue, also, that they do not really make any merchant accept Bitcoin in any meaningful way.

Wallets, processors and other commercial players had no problem in migrating to support P2SH. They will have little trouble adapting to a LN protocol, especially if it gets merged into Core, XT or whatever.
Ultimately, the address system has a lot of advantages, but it is not well adapted for payments. This is why BIP70 got developed.
In order to succeed, Bitcoin urgently needs BIP70, LN or other payment protocols. Abusing the address system for common payments has too much promoted invasive and insecure practices like address reuse.

Tinfoil hat off: Tether is nominally pegged to USD, and so it helps close arbitrage cycles in exchanges that implement it. In this sense, Tether stabilizes Bitcoin prices, reduces exchanges gaps, and distributes liquidity so that it decreases exchange centralization.
Tinfoil hat on: When most of Bitfinex's BTCs got hacked last year, they did a bail-in to avoid fractional reserve; however, they did not cut just BTC's balances but every fiat and crypto balance in the same proportion (roughly, they lost like 90% of corn but instead took only like 40% of every balance). The price of BTC has gone up explosively since then so, unless they where properly and completely hedged, it is entirely possible that they were solvent right after the bail-in, but have become insolvent now. Bitfinex owns a majority stake on Tether's issuer. Therefore, it would be plausible that they would cover up their insolvency by issuing fake, unbacked Tether and buy BTC with it.
That second scenario is exactly what happened with MtGox. The difference is that Willy did not buy the necessary BTC in time, while Spoofy probably has done it (it had to buy 60% only, and the hack was 120k BTC only not 800k).

well, block reward is composed of subsidy (supply inflation) and fees. Stricto sensu, what we mine are blocks, not bitcoins, but in a way you can say we mine part of that subsidy, of which the last satoshi will be exhausted c2140. 
After that, the entirety of the reward will have to come from fees. And much sooner than that, maybe as early as within two "halvenings" from now, most of the reward will have to ideally come from fees, to bring enough security.

It is proper use of the term, AFAIK. On the absence of signaling, no player will voluntarily reduce the acceptability of their work-backed product (i.e., softfork) and so the Schelling point is the *status quo*. Signaling changes the trade-offs (even if it is partially faked!) and can move the Nash equilibrium to softfork activation.
The biggest risk is that the *economic weighing* is a guess, so let us hope that it is at least a *shared guess*.
Ideally, it would be nice to have anti-UASF signaling too, as an extra precaution, but I do not see how SegWit -being opt-in in nature- would be rationally opposed by anyone.
Unrelatedly, consider that UAEB is a bad joke from people who suck at game theory: Hardforks are ALWAYS user activated (of course!) and they require **everyone** to move on or otherwise create a schism (a.k.a. altcoin).
@_date: 2017-04-09 21:56:29
It does not matter. There is no way to evaluate the economic significance of a node, anyway.
For what is worth, reddit support comments have probably a larger impact than on nodes' uacomments. Now, if we could add UASF-supporting messages to transactions, that would be different.

What? You are still not aware of it? r/btc has been showing mountains of evidence for months. Segwit's author is employed by Blockstream, which is owned by Axa, which presides the Bilderberg Group (a.k.a. the New World Order). As such, Segwit is, with absolute certainty, a Troyan horse designed to destroy Bitcoin and Humanity (as it will only activate past mainstream adoption). All this is so obvious, as is the conspiracy to cripple Bitcoin that prevents us from having gigabyte blocks today.
The fact that you asked that question means that you have been brainwashed by the Illuminati that are constantly censoring this sub.

This is a key point IMHO. Personally, I am willing to process everyone's transactions (settlements, ideally) in my node so that I can know for myself when people have paid me.
But I want all the semi-trusted micro-transactions, gambling, shapeshifting, diamond registration, botnet controlling and similar **out of my blockchain**. There are sidechains / altchains for this. Anyone would prefer to pay small fees when s/he pays their payees, but if it takes higher fees to keep spam at bay so be it.

The title says "Telegram users buy Bitcoin". Telegrams are able to transmit arbitrary messages, so they should be able to transmit Bitcoin transactions too (appropriately encoded).
Clicking on the link, it seems like it is something else. Yet again that absurd insistence in registering trademarks after common words.

It is not that bad, that one.
Coinbase bitcoins are made of proof of work. For the rest, you can say that transactions spend a set of inputs and create a set of outputs of equal or less value. 
It is not precise, because there can be outputs that do not have any signatures at all, but in a way, a majority of "bitcoins are made of digital signatures" (which prove either previously unspent outputs or previous work).
@_date: 2017-04-27 19:58:18
If I sounded aggressive, it was not my intention, sorry.
It really does not matter if it is malice or incompetence. The reality is that Bitmain devices have a non-disablable, hardcoded, unauthenticated, exploitable kill switch. 
This implies that Bitmain or Cloudflare can readily disable most of Bitcoin mining hardware right now. Hackers and other DNS hijackers can do less, but still significant disruption.

They have some (minor) advantage when a central authority issues the blocks and other nodes can act as watchmen. This is how Ripple works.
The resulting system is permissioned, not permissionless, and transactions can be censored in every arbitrary way. However, observers can verify the consistency of the blocks so that there is some degree of transparency not available to other centralized systems.
Example: Part of Ripple's initial history was "lost", probably faked. Because it is a public blockchain, people has been aware of this inconsistency.

Well, no, there is some early pre-release [version that used signed 32-bit integers]( and that was what limited to 21M (with cent as the minimum subunit). Then Hal noted that it would need at least a million subunits more. It has little to do with floats or Javascript.

They are not, but this does not matter. Dozens of Bitcoin banks have failed so far and the result is always the same: The company goes bankrupt (be it hacked or "hacked"), then the lawyers and bankruptcy trustees eat up anything left, including depositors' and creditors' funds.
In theory, if there were something left, depositors and creditors would then get their share and still then, if fully repaid, anything else would go to the owners or shareholders.

Why is segwit contentious? (I mean, technically, not politically)
All I have heard is "blah blah blah *technical debt* blah blah blah" as if technical debt was not something affecting absolutely every Bitcoin upgrade (because a decentralized system needs forward compatibility; it is dev-centralized if not). Segwit is a technical wonder: It solves malleability (superior mode for tumblebit and lightning), has linear scaling, covers the amount (good for hardware wallets), realigns the UTXO pollution incentive and makes upgrading to future signature types much easier. The moderate block size increase (so that it stays on the safety margins) is just a side effect.

@_date: 2015-07-23 18:36:53
A contentious block-size increase does not scare me very much. 
What really does scare me is a coordinated (but not necessarily colluding) majority mining cartel rejecting one of the reward halvings, especially once they get small.
This is definitely possible and has already happened before: see dogecoin. It just takes a couple of Krugman-style arguments that happen to be acceptable by the general public, or maybe just miners insisting in that they need a sizable reward for securing the blocks.
This is why experts see as essential that a fee market develops as soon as possible. Even when technical capacity could allow for many more frictionless transactions.

That is likely not true. btc.com and Jihan's support is probably because they think that they could more easily attempt a coup to them than to Core (e.g., similar to  This does not mean that they are going as far as directly funding them.
In my view, bcoin is a positive thing. There is no formal verification so they are not probably consensus compatible with Bitcoin Core. Nevertheless, Bitcoin Core releases are probably not compatible with themselves already, and maybe there are edge cases with a consensus loss even inside a release (like what happened with the BDB lock limit).
The good thing is that we have a rather good community-wide consensus of what are the "legitimate" constraints and what are bugs, so in case of a consensus split, we should be able to reconcile it rather quickly.

He is probably not trolling. This is what happened with Ripple: They *issued* their premine and they distributed it, a small part for free and they sold another. They were actually registered as MSB, but they were only doing KYC for the coins they sold. As a consequence, they got severely fined and forced to change their software to KYC everyone.
Mining is not a problem *per se*, as miners did not create the system. They are the receivers, not the issuers, of newer coin issuance.

Let me restate it:
*For what is worth, reddit support comments have probably a larger impact than on nodes' uacomments,* **that is, nearly zero**.
If you want to UASF, then yes, run the patched version, or wait for the fork [and call *invalidateblock*]( on the post-fork non-segwit chain.
 But in the end, what happens if there is no chain to accept as valid? It makes no sense that there is a split just over new functionality. Past the flagday, we will most probably have either a segwit chain or a non-segwit one, but it is (game theoretically) irrational that we have both.
Therefore, if you are an economically significant node, state your support for UASF as publicly as possible; just do not think that the number of nodes with a certain user agent (be it true signaling or fake) means anything.

There is a potential security risk if you do not use deterministic signatures. Your transaction will contain several signatures with the same key. If you used a weak PRNG (it is nearly impossible to know for sure; even /dev/urandom is weak under some circumstances) the attacker can instantly calculate your private key and issue a concurrent transaction that spends to herself. Yours is not necessarily mined first.
If all your outputs are under different private keys, you do not have that risk. Also, because you are not forced to spend all of them, your transaction will be cheaper fee wise.

Realistically, all that is public information, so the market probably takes it into account already right now.

Yes. This is true for a UASF, or an hybrid MASF that has economic support (i.e., acceptance by coin valuers), like Segwit. In a pure MASF (only by mining nodes), however, nobody will rationally orphan an offending block, because defectors would eat the cake of those trying to do so.

I only know that their reserves cover my balance (provided that BitGo's claim is true); I cannot know about other users' balances or, in particular, if some user (depositor / creditor) has been excluded. That said, the existence of that tool is public and discussion about it is open, therefore I assume that if someone got excluded we would eventually know it.

The wider consensus protocol lacks formal verification so, for what we know, the current (post BIP50) set of rules could still very well be consensus incapable, strictly speaking.
What is known for sure, empirically, is that today's blockchain cannot be validated by 0.7 nodes (yes, they validated as late as 2015, well past the May 2013 "forking" upgrade, but we ended up forking after all, as much as observables matter).
Furthermore, notice that there is no way to meaningfully sift bugs from intended behavior. Having a "reference specification" has failed miserably in ETH.

Every SF can also be implemented as a HF (albeit less safe to deploy). If nearly every user wants a change and miners refuse it (e.g., 6% preventing a 95% activation), we can force it as a HF.

Let me help you then:
Praxeology's post is quite detailed. The only criticism that I can think of is that the "zero profit on average" argument does not take into account the risk premium. I see no reason why the order of magnitude should not be correct.
Corem's post is really shocking, because he obviously should know better. He confuses things and takes severe underestimations. As discussed on the comments section of the post, there is no way electricity costs are less than 10% of the coin value that is being produced. It is really as if he is being purposely disingenuous, just like KnC Sam "no way there is an AsicBoost chip there" or Toomim "this is impossible over stratum" (maybe because they are trying to hide that they have infringed a patent? let us not speculate, though).
Just a few details: We are talking about the hashers here, not pools. The $100M figure refers to Bitmain devices (75%), not Antpool (17%). AsicBoost is present in S7 and R4 too, at least, not just S9. He uses the 15% instead of the 30% boost estimate. Base electricity cost is only a part of the gain: Less Joule per hash means also less heating (by the laws of thermodynamics) that needs to be evacuated, less per-hash space and -most importantly!- less per-hash device cost (as it is included by default, even if buyers did not know it). Those "per-hash" refer to the *effective* hash calculated (be it directly or via Asiboost's midstate shortcut).

Well, it is more philosophical than anything.
In my view (and, I would say, Peter's), the number of nodes `m` is proportional to `n` (leading to O(n^(2))) because the system is, as per the title of the whitepaper, **peer to peer**.
However, if you think that `m` is indeed constant and that those thousands of nodes can serve several billions of users, then the system reduces to a *highly redundant server-client* model. Gavin either thinks that this is still enough to preserve the censorship resistance of the system or is fine with a system that is not fully resistant as long as it is useful. I disagree, but I have to admit that all of his actions are coherent with that view, so he is at least being transparent.

There is nothing backing Bitcoin other than its subjective valuation. If Bitcoin fails, it would be clear that its successor is fallible too, and so it will not rationally get any valuation as store of value (as it, too, would be subject to get superseded at any moment).
Bitcoin can permanently stay the leader because it can morph into anything. Anything can be made as a sidechain, and the sidechain can become the main chain (that is, get full security) if a majority agrees.

It is a bit subtle. It is "optimization" as seen from a computing perspective, it is an "attack" in the very specific crypto-system sense, and still it is an "attack" in a more general political sense against segwit and similar upgrades (though you could alternatively see segwit as an unintentional attack against asicboost).
For the ecosystem, Segwit is beneficial and Asicboost is neutral at best (it is somewhat *negative* if not all players have equal access to it). However, a decentralized system like Bitcoin works on individual incentives, not collective ones.

Because there is a big demand for something like *Ideal Money*, and Bitcoin is the closest thing to Ideal Money that exists today. Not only this, but it is also not unreasonable to think that it might become Ideal Money some day.

A definitive eye opener for me. I still though that, while JS node is silly, and while the extblock proposal got closed-door crafted, they were well intentioned. 
Anyway, I think that this PR will essentially force a UASF. Since we know that some anti-segwit miners are testing bcoin, this nearly guarantees that a majority non-segwit chain will steal funds. And since a stealing chain is worthless, an economic **unanimity** will rationally get behind the UASF for any non-zero hashrate supporting it (certainly BTCC at least).
@_date: 2017-04-12 10:23:54

In a way, all softforks are UASFs. Unless they contain a bug fix or some very specific miner-only advantage, it makes no sense that miners restrict the rule set (i.e., softfork) if it is not to correspond a big user demand for it 
The fact that we use BIP9 signaling is just a safety net for smooth upgrade. It makes no sense that users "signal" anything: If the softfork makes bitcoins instantly more valuable, *miners* will rationally signal softfork willingness. A significantly enough economic *minority* can already make this happen; anything that increases the acceptability of blocks will be rationally followed by miners (a corollary of this: segwit blocking does not look rational).
I can imagine scenarios where *economic majority* makes sense. For example, softfork to feature X, which economic majority see it as positive and economic minority see it as negative, so it is still activated because the outcome of a schism is worse than the negative payout to the minority. Soft-hard-forks would fall in that case, but I cannot see how segwit would.
In conclusion, segwit blocking is not rational unless we consider other factors, probably ASICBOOST disablement. Cheating or not, "attack" or not, I think that there is a wide agreement that ASICBOOST is an undesirable -dangerous even- optimization. I suggest that we UASF to disable it first, and segwit support should naturally follow after.

There are a few good economists who study Bitcoin. Actually, part of the technical block size debate is due to [some of their recent findings](


So no. Miners should not have that freedom.
Bitcoin is Byzantine fault tolerant only under a rather weak assumption: the one that faulty nodes are unable to solve blocks faster than the honest ones. Any weakening of that condition (be it through centralization and hacking, through regulation, or otherwise) can effectively destroy the network.  Even honey badgers are mortal.

Nice. Yes, it is an expectable outcome. However:
 - Lightning "hubs" is not accurate: Miners (pools) will be high-degree network nodes, but the actual topology will be probably closer to *small world*, as it makes sense that the channel topology matches the actual transaction topology. Therefore, there will be redundant links and no distinguished hierarchy (no hubs).
 - Miners are net sellers, so their channels will get quickly unbalanced and renewed. Lightning is still advantageous in that case, but much less than for the regular user who will have her channels open practically indefinitely.

Because what gives Bitcoin value is the fact that it is decentralized (and therefore permissionless, uncensorable and unforgeable).
This comes at an incredibly high cost. Centralized (or highly hierarchized) global ledgers will always scale better: see, e.g., Ripple.
However, once only a few key players matter, then regulators are able to force blacklisting. See, again, Ripple, as an example: The devs have been forced to register as an MSB and its users are being forced to pass a validation process just to run open-source software.
EDIT: To clarify my point, scalability is also essential, of course. But only if the system does not break in one of its fundamental properties in the process of scaling up. In other words, a few anonymous miners should still be able to add uncensored blocks to the chain without the majority being able to orphan them out.

Most of your outputs are dust-sized (i.e., spam) and cannot be ordinarily spent. However, most of your coins (i.e., the largest outputs) can be spent. If you try to send a smaller amount, the fee will get drastically reduced. 
Your best option: Download Electrum and export your blockchain.info private key to it. In Electrum, send to yourself and adjust the fee sliding bar to the minimum. The transaction may take a day to confirm, but the fee will be greatly reduced.
For the smallest outputs, for which the fee is larger than the value, you can use

You mentioned a single, presumably malware infested WinXP computer. This computer will mutate addresses displayed in it (ala Trojan.Coinbitclip) and so I will get pwned for the payment amount, but not for the change amount.

He can only shut down miners that are directly connecting to the internet. 
It is imaginable that any properly managed farm (i.e., the biggest ones at least) has the miners on a local network and only the host system has direct (outbound) access to the internet. Therefore, big time disruption was definitely possible, but for arguably less than 70% of the hashrate.

I cannot understand why this happens. Pooling does not increase the revenue; it only decreases the variance. And the *optimal* strategy for variance reduction is to mine simultaneously at every pool with the same proportion as their respective global share of the hashing power (this at least for non-attacking pools; [if pools attack each other, then there is actually a shrinking force](

As with any other hardfork, the only way to do it is that we create a new altcoin with the old blockchain history, and then everyone lets the "old" Bitcoin die, so that the new altcoin can take its name. If the old chain does not die and it retains -however small- real economic use, it would be improper to call *Bitcoin* something else (this is not like in the ETH/ETC case, where a centralized Foundation owns a copyright and decides what is called what). BIP2 gives some useful definitions in that sense.
On the other hand, the energy consumption will probably *not* go down, if the price is preserved. Mining is permissionless and so it has no rent: The marginal cost of mining 1 BTC will follow the spot market price of 1 BTC. GPUs are readily available *en masse* and they can be repurposed/sold later should they become unprofitable, so the majority of the mining cost would probably be electricity, even more than today. The total energy consumption would probably increase.

Bitcoins are abstract units of value. You can say that when they get "locked" on-chain, they get "unlocked" on-LN. 
Which side is preferable? On LN, you get zero friction, instant finality, and zero risk (cooperation is incentivized). On chain, you have nothing of these and the only advantage is that you do not need to renew channels. Therefore, ultimately, on-chain transactions will probably be mainly those from and to cold storage.

Exactly. It is not *locked in* in the classical sense as you can freely move the funds: spend them entirely, earn them back (routed through the same channel), then spend them again. 
For example, an employee that has a single channel with her employer can still fully use the LN. She buys goods and services from others, but as long as there is path (there will; employer is already buying/getting paid bitcoins from others) it will get routed to her channel.
And people will have *many* channels. I bet your hot wallet has many outputs from different payers and payees. As we transition to Lightning, most of these will be channels, because they are more advantageous like this.

I do not follow, sorry. S can only send 1.5BTC if he has 1.5BTC. If S-P1 S-P2 and S-P3 sum only 1BTC, and there is no S-P4 with the other half, then S cannot send 1.5BTC.
Or, do you mean that S has the other 0.5BTC outside of LN? In that case he would first create a new 0.5BTC channel with either P1-3, with a new P4, or directly with S, and send the 1.5BTC on-LN afterwards.




As LN wallets get integrated with on-chain wallets, the process can be pretty much automatized. In that case, the channel will start unbalanced, and the channel initiator may have to add a small anti-DoS fee (that covers an eventual on-chain exit fee) to his counterparty. Unless it is a cold storage, it makes no sense to have coins sitting on a wallet "unassigned", i.e., not on a channel; there is practically no risk in accepting channel proposals even from random strangers.


Yes, channels get combined. No, the high-level payment can see the multiple routes as a single event.

That is certainly not a Nash equilibrium. 
Miners already have good links, powerful hardware and dedicated engineers. It is not hard for them to support any upgrade, as long as it increases the acceptability of their blocks to a significant enough part of the economy. Unforked chain accepts softforked chain as valid, but the converse is not true, hence softforked chain gets imposed. As long as this is not seen as hostile by the rest, big pills can be force swallowed that way. The problem is that, short of the nuclear option "change the algorithm", there is no appropriate defense against that.

In both P2SH and SegWit the outputs are clearly distinguished. If the payee receives spendings from these, she immediately notices and she should wait for more than "a confirmation". 
Notice that the same applies to any other payment that is technically valid but non-standard.

However, the old rules would still be valid and non-mining users could still safely use Bitcoin.

I suspect they probably got inspired by that but, anyway, my thing was just a curiosity, whereas Revealer is actually useful:
 - it is text, not QR. The advantage with *visual cryptography* is that it decodes just with the laws of optics, without need of hackable devices; QR needs a device, which somewhat defeats the purpose (when used for private keys anyway)
 - they send you one share (the transparent one); you print the other. If your printer gets compromised, you are still safe

There is still much benevolence in mining today. No selfish mining (despite it could be profitable at any share), no generalized withholding attacks, no replace by fee, etc. Opponent disruption could happen already today with miners mining [transactions that take 3 minutes to verify](
If we raised the maximum block size to 20MB, we probably would not see 20MB blocks the following day.
Nevertheless, this will not last. We cannot rely on the absence of these,  and we cannot ignore these and keep on increasing the surface of attack of the system.

Notice that extended blocks do not form a regular sidechain; they are a slaved chain to (some) main-chain blocks. Validators of the extended blocks also validate the standard blocks.
Their value could differ, but not by much, as you can freely move between standard and extended blocks. In the long term, and if the large blocks stay valuable (i.e., not centralized / censorable), then most bitcoins would move to the extended blocks as soon as they get coinbased.

I agree that they pose a big risk. However, it is unavoidable. This is not a hardfork split that creates an altcoin: Once enough people are extblock ready (even if they are an economic *minority* as long as it is significant enough) it will make sense that (some) miners enforce it. It is hence a risk that has always been there and, unlike the empty-dummy-block proposals (evil softfork), nobody is forced to upgrade.
If the extended part is of 2-3MB, acceptability will probably be high enough. If it is 1GB, then it will most probably merit a hashing-algorithm change.

Other signs that we might still not be at "genuine" full capacity:
- Many spam / unoptimized transactions (long chains): 
- High fee heterogeneity:  Most users are systematically overpaying!
- Fee adjustment mechanisms (RBF, CPFP) are already implemented in a few wallets and work very well; most users still do not care.

SegWit already doubles the block size. If a doubling is unsafe, this is true for either method.
Also, I do not think that there is much urgency. Fees are higher than they used to be, but most people do not care: They systematically overpay, even above thrice the minimum fee that would get included. Let us get RBF deployed first, then segwit/extblock. 
As much as I prefer BIP141, I would be fine with extblock by Christmas, even deployed as UASF. If that proposal is just posturing, let us ignore it and take the BIP148 way, but if even one (ill-named) big-blocker can get re-unified with that, then I can wait.

Guy Corem's analysis is shockingly inaccurate (and since he rather obviously should know better, he is most probably intentionally misleading). He severely underestimates every figure used.
First, we are discussing about Bitmain's 70%, not Antpool's 17%. Electricity cost is much more than 10%; it is above 30% even for the most efficient miners. Also, ASICBOOST is not only about less power consumption: Less power means also less cooling and, most importantly, less device cost (per effective hashrate). The boost has been often claimed to be 30% (Spondoolies "equivalent" method could be 15% though).

Extension blocks are supposed to be opt-in; they are not altcoins unlike XT, Classic or BTU.
They are conceptually quite similar to Segwit. Adam Back and Theymos have been making proposals in that sense, and they could be an interesting solution in case real use explodes and we need the extra capacity deployed in a relatively short time (I do not think that that is the case today; same-day tx have a fee under ~5c and very urgent ones ~50c).
I support Segwit first, as it is very good tech and it would be a pity not having it on the main block. After that, however, it would be nice to have (well-developed and well-tested) ext blocks, because Schnorr will help optimize the witnesses but not the non-witness space.

It is all about edge cases, really. Have a look at BIP42 too: Satoshi's original code did not even had 21M limited supply, even when he certainly thought that it had it.
It is almost guaranteed that there are other BIP50-like bugs there. Consensus critical code is too complex to get formally verified (at least with today's methods), so current Core code is most probably not consensus capable in a strict sense. Those edge cases are more obscure and we have not hit them yet (maybe we will never hit them). Anyway, bcoin is almost certainly not bug-by-bug compatible with Core.

Yes, I have read the post by Sam Cole too; another shockingly misleading piece. "There cannot be ASICBOOST circuitry there" even after Bitmain themselves had confirmed that it was there. It is hard to be naive facing such obvious lies. If I did not trust their ultimate honesty, I would even believe that they are trying to hide that they willingly infringed a patent.
The biggest "error" is to consider only direct electricity cost: The skipped work means that ASICBOOST achieves also more hashes per device cost, more hashes per device space, more hashes per cooling unit, etc.
[This analysis by Praxeology Guy]( seems to support the $100M figure. Mining is permissionless so we cannot be incredibly far from that rent-free equilibrium. There is obviously some risk premium that makes it, in practice, less than the equilibrium, but the actual profit "boost" is probably closer to 100M than to 2M.

Of course mining is absent from rent (it is permissionless after all). **Any** increase in hashrate will certainly reduce your RoI, and you are "competing against yourself" in that sense at any rate.
Still, a rational investor will increase her hashing power until her RoI hits her acceptable minimum (defined from the availability of alternate investments), and the miners as a whole will further maximize it to the point where the marginal cost meets the marginal reward.

Gedankenexperiment for you: XCP covers all of Bitcoin's use cases. Imagine that we softfork to enforce validity on XCP transactions (to enable SPV and such), and then we collectively agree that XCP is the new BTC. Would now-worthless BTC fees ensure any security and reorg protection on the blockchain? Now, imagine the same for a scenario where BTC is still valuable but XCP &gt;&gt; BTC.
In conclusion, XCP free rides on BTC and it only works when its (collective) value is much less than that of the main chain. If not, the economic incentives that transform the tree of all possible valid blocks into a single chain fall apart.
Personally, I would not call XCP transactions *spam* as long as they pay the fee, but I do not want to increase my full node costs just to make more space for them.

Someone makes a new transaction that pays some fee to the one that mines it into a block. A node-miner receives this transactions. Why would she tell her peers instead of keeping it for when she finds a block?
In this setting, wallets would need to make thousands of connections to transmit their transactions to a majority of the miners. This would be unpractical and completely different from the case now where you send once and it spreads to most of the network in seconds.
@_date: 2016-02-11 13:07:53
Well, soft limits, like in the *block size soft limit*, are usually referred as *policy*, specifically implying that they **do not** involve any kind of soft- or hard-fork.
Soft-forks are more than policy IMHO; they are changes of the rules. Long-range reorganizations can occur if the support for these fluctuates. But it is just a definition and you can still call them *policy* if you want. The point is that a soft-fork can be undone only with a hard-fork.


There has already been some discussion about that temporarily soft-forking to smaller block sizes or, equivalently, to less aggressive increase schedules. The main objection, if I recall correctly, is that the incentives for the big, well connected miners will be against the second soft-fork. E.g., if there is a high hard limit and a (soft-fork enforced) temporary limit, there may not be enough support to extend the limiting period even if small miners need it; big miners would vote for eating their part. It would thus be a centralizing force.

Normally, those two transactions will get mined together (child pays for parent mechanism). You may have to wait a couple of days though, because the combined fee is a bit low. 
Alternatively, you can send to yourself (again) this time with a higher fee. If you use your hardware wallet with Electrum, it has a very good fee adjusting option.

In that case, R needs a new channel (with either P1-4 or directly with S) of 0.5BTC. Notice that he does not *need* 0.25BTC for that, as long as this channel starts unbalanced.
It should be possible even to combine the channel setup with a routed payment of the remaining 1BTC, so that both are seen as a single transaction in the wallet.

It is the same thing, in practice. The "regular" block gets extended for upgraded nodes, which past activation will see blocks larger. There is only one "block type" and it gets monolithically transmitted/processed. Then, for compatibility with old nodes, there is an option to broadcast only the restricted part in the old serialization to them.

In one word: BIP50
Bitcoin needs global consensus, which implies bit-exactness across all instances. C++ is a high-level programming language, though probably on one of the *lowest* highs. JS is not even a programming language but a script, which is almost (but not always !) interpreted in a virtual machine. Theoretically, bit-exactness should be possible in a JS node, but it is arguably much harder as you climb in abstraction levels.

this is old news: for five years, the remaining bitcoins did not get liquidated, so as the price went up the exchange moved back to solvency (in terms of bankruptcy debt, this is, transformed to fiat). This made the court change the bankruptcy chapter from *liquidation* to *rehabilitation*, in which BTC claims can be evaluated in terms of BTC, not fiat. Because of this, Gox creditors may be receiving their bitcoins back as bitcoins (around 20% of BTC + $480 for price at bankruptcy).
That said, and even considering the above, Finex kept operational, making fee revenue, and with liquidity for the bailout tokens, so the outcome for Finex users was much better than for Gox users.

I say nothing about changing rules (??).
Yes, the new functionality, the extra capacity of a bridged BTCchain-LTCchain, can be beneficial. My point is that we can have it too with a mainchain-sidechain bridging (with a LN on both, as proposed in the OP), so Litecoin is not strictly necessary. We can have the extra capacity without the extra coin or the extra consensus system.
The second solution is preferable over the first, because a single consensus system is more useful than two or more (e.g., Metcalfe's Law, coin confusion, acceptability, etc.). Also, more people are invested in BTC than in LTC, so a reunification (via sidechains) around BTC chain is more probable than around any other chain, and that is an equilibrium state.

No, it does not rely on anything like that. If at fork day there are no miners behind, then they do not have any blockchain; it simply halts. If miners get behind it, then the blockchain softforks.
Technically, it is also possible that we have a split, but game theoretically it does not make any sense. A split would make sense for some fundamental disagreement like the DAO (which was a hardfork not soft, but would have happened also as a softfork; ETC has soft- and hardforked after multiple times), but not for a feature upgrade like Segwit.

He does not. He mentions *grinding* in a broad sense and notice that his argument is ultimately economical, not technical. Whatever mechanism that generates some valuable will be exploited until the marginal cost of this exploitation equals the reward.
Technically, you seem to confuse things: 51% is for a monopolistic attack, where the monopolist mints all the coins. Grinding is just malleating the hashes to chain blocks to have a higher-than-expected reward. If this is likelier at higher stakes, then stakeholders can collude and keep most of the minting to their cartel.

English is a foreign language for me. It sounds somewhat odd that the top-level commenter refers to a relative with an indirect nounphrase "sisters' kids" instead of a direct one "niece" or "nephew".
The only issue that I see with the latter form is that it assumes a binary gender for those children (and this was maybe not intended). Therefore, I replied that, if that was the reason, the top-level commenter had already *assumed a gender* when referring to her/his siblings as "sisters".

In practice, not many. If your computer gets infected, in the second case you would lose all of your coins, while in the first case you will just lose some of them (the payment amount).
You probably have already a 2nd device (phone+PC or phone+tablet) so it is best to do multisig between them (with Electrum it is extremely easy). This is safer (just cross-check the payment address), cheaper (unnecessary hardware wallet device) and more forgiving (2-of-3 multisig means that you can lose one of the seeds and still recover your coins).

It does not *increase* the blocksize limit, it entirely *removes* it. In its place, it sets a block *weight* limit, where signatures (the "witness") weigh less than the rest of the transaction.

Therefore, blocks with them get bigger, typically 2.1-2.4MB (the 3.7MB are special cases of uncommon signature-heavy transactions).

Now, "useless" is maybe a bit too much. Electrum uses SPV (header chain + branch proof) and in a way that is actually significantly more private than with other SPV clients; you tell your addresses to someone, but not to all the world. On the other hand, Electrum is especially convenient for doing multisig and using hardware wallets in a simple way.
So, if you already trust your payers, and do not critically care about your privacy, then Electrum is quite OK.

All SF are UASF in a way. Readiness signaling is just a safety mechanism to ensure that as little as possible mining gets wasted by mistake. It has absolutely nothing to do with voting.
*Voting* is also used in the whitepaper in a very restricted sense to describe the consensus mechanism (1-cpu 1-vote) when deciding which transaction is genuine and which is double spending, i.e., with little to do with actual decision taking.

After 28 days, miners behind the majority could have backed off. They would rationally do it especially if they think that the new coins would be less valuable than the old coins, but there is [no single strategy that dominates the other](
Moreover, the activation could have triggered with a minority of the hashing power: 
Your analysis shows quite clearly that attempting a hard-fork without at least a version bit is more an attack than a sensible proposal. In addition, if they aim for a small supermajority percentage (i.e., 75% instead of 95%) which leaves some probability to coexisting branches, they should also flag a version bit for the transactions, so that users can signal which branch users want to use.

Yes, it is inevitable. Since it is an absorbing state, and it is definitely accessible, it is *guaranteed* to happen in finite time.
Satoshi did not see that as a catastrophic failure of the system, as a rational monopolist is incentivized to act benevolently, even resist censorship and regulatory capture. However, the system is much less robust in the monopolist state. Peter Todd and Gün Sirer see that as a big issue, but for Paul Sztorc it is almost irrelevant.
Maybe, the *credible threat* that we (economic majority) will do a POW algorithm change in case the monopolist arises would be enough to prevent reaching the monopolist state, and thus the need for such a damaging change in the first place.

A reputation system destroys the design of the system as a computing power exchange with simple bidding. It would become an *open market* more than an *exchange*, with all the friction associated to merchanting. This is unfeasible for large rendering projects, at least as long as the sellers are home users and not server farms.
Additionally, reputation, depending on how you take it into account, may make the system be marginally profitable for the *reputable*, established actors, but not for new ones. The system may thus not be able to grow.

Why would a rational miner voluntarily reduce the acceptability of their blocks? In a pure MASF, and in the absence of a big miner-only added value (not in segwit), miners would not rationally fork at any hashrate significantly lower than 100%. Cartel behavior is non-enforceable as there is no way to punish defectors, and defection (i.e., orphaning the forking block) is a Nash equilibrium. Said in other words, a pure MASF is not incentive compatible at any threshold lower than 100%.
This can only change if, still in a pure MASF, there is a pay-off increase for crafting forking blocks (e.g., a decrease of validation costs), or if the SF activation is also followed by at least some economically significant nodes  who would thus reduce the block acceptability of defectors (that is, a UASF).

No. Monero has little use and nearly zero real-world use; this implies that the vast majority of transactions come from or go to centralized exchanges, where they can be identified. The rest can thus be easily unveiled by metadata.

Bitcoin, and also Litecoin, are backed by *proof of wasted electricity*: Even if work does not make coins valuable *per se*, work makes a competitive effort to create them until work-value matches the subjective value of the coins.
In practice, this competitive mechanism works with two elements: difficulty retargeting (to have blocks ~10' apart from each other) and subsidy halving. The latter is essential so that the cryptocurrency does not have worse supply scarcity than precious metals.
In Bitcoin, this implies that there will never be more than 21M coins (84M for Litecoin). If we consider more and more non-consensus chains as valuable, this limit effectively disappears and debases the entire *cryptocurrency system*.
This is avoidable though: Sidechains give the same extra capacity via "multiple highways" -as described in the OP- without any value dilution.

Soft limits are not enforceable. They have worked in the past out of goodwill, but they will not in case of a serious attack. Mining cartels cannot work in Bitcoin: Everyone can mine and there is no way to punish defectors. They cannot enforce a policy.
What should be possible, however, is to hard-fork to 8MB and simultaneously soft-fork to 2MB as a temporary rule. This way, raising it again after this period does not require another hard-fork, and the period can be indefinitely extended with just a soft-fork.

No, you cannot. My work stays valid; there is just no guarantee that the blockchains will last forever or that its tokens will stay valuable.
This is not weak subjectivity because hard-forks are never supposed to be part of the system. A hard-fork means nothing less than to create a new system with different rules and, this is a common misunderstanding, **fully independent of the original one**. If the hard-fork has unanimous consensus among Bitcoin users, then Bitcoin users will let Bitcoin die and adopt the new system, which they may or may not still call Bitcoin.
A hard-fork does not mean to change a rule at some point of time (block height). The fact that a static rule is substituted by one that has a dynamical evolution is just a trick to make the UTXO set at some point coincide in both systems to make the hard-fork more acceptable, but it is not at all inherent to the system, which has thus no subjectivity: the system is still a genesis block and a set of consensus rules, none of which depends on a past observed state or checkpoint.

Yes, of course. And because only full nodes enforce validity (for now, at least), it is important that full node costs stay reasonably affordable (notice that I am not claiming that each of the 15M users needs a full node). 
Personally, I use Bitcoin every other day and my total fee costs are much less than my total node costs (and non-urgent 3c transactions get confirmed usually in much less than 48h).
That said, it is rather obvious that we will need bigger blocks sooner or later.

By 2012 a few individuals had amassed hundreds of thousands of coins. Most of them, for what we know, sold the vast majority of their stashes as they reached sizeable returns on the order of 1000%. I am convinced that even Rover Ver and Mircea Popescu own today only a tiny part of what they used to.
Even then, yes, a few people have a lot. They will go on distributing more and more as price rises, but they will almost certainly become incredibly rich. Then, the Lightning Network will have the capacity of increasing the money velocity of Bitcoin by orders of magnitude. I can imagine a Bitcoin that becomes the reserve currency of the World yet it is not above 100k$ each (in price-equivalent terms), especially in a Bitcoin-adoption scenario that follows global collapse or massive degrowth.
In the end, however, it is not a question of whether it is good or not. A Bitcoin future could be more democratic, or maybe it will be extremely tyrannic.

Hardware wallets have attack vectors, but generic computers are typically far worse. While you can be quite certain that the Ledger is airgapped (it does not connect directly to the internet), it is difficult to achieve this with a computer, unless you physically remove all its network interfaces, and even then it is vulnerable to many forms of sidechannel key extraction to which the Ledger is made resistant.

Bigblocker/smallblocker distinction is just stupid. Nearly nobody wants 1MB blocks forever (other than Mircea Popescu and others on his sphere, probably). Most of the network has already upgraded to support moderately bigger blocks, and can be upgraded again in the near future.
The main problem that I see is with a central committee defining a policy (fees or other). Yes, it is probably too soon for a fee market and we could still wait 4 years until the next halvening, but this needs community-wide consent and decentralized deployment. Soft limits somewhat worked in the beginning, but they are not incentive compatible and so they are not reliable in the future now that the network is much more developed.
There is also another big risk: Free riding has been increasing a lot in the last years. Factom and Counterparty just piggy back on Bitcoin's security but do not make bitcoins any more valuable; their transactions are economically insignificant on the Bitcoin side, as they already have their (premined) token of value.

many wallet software let you have more than one wallet. You just need to have one with bip49 (segwit embedded, p2wpkh-p2sh, start with 3) and the other with bip84 (segwit native, p2wpkh, start with bc). You would use the former only for legacy receiving, and forward to the latter. If you use Electrum, it is relatively simple to spend in a same transaction from the p2wpkh-p2sh input that sends the change directly to your p2wpkh wallet.

Price evolution afterwards is irrelevant. Madoff too paid insane returns to some (just an example of why this is irrelevant; not that I am trying to compare ETH to Madoff).
 It is practically guaranteed that if every ETH investor wanted to cash out right now, they would not be able to get what they put initially.

Look at the uncle comment, also: The fact that the behavior was non-deterministic means that changing it was not even properly a "hard" fork in the usual sense.

Feerate explorers use *virtual* bytes, which  are weight units divided by 4. You will probably find it less confusing like this. [See]( Working like that, the virtual size of a transaction is:
    non-witness size + 0.25 witness size
which explains why there can be blocks nearly 4MB big, which still are less than 1MB in virtual bytes. You can also see here why all transactions with signatures would be strictly smaller (in vB) under segwit than for their non-segwit counterparts. Totally, Bitcoin passes from 7 transactions per second to 16 transactions per second.


But this presumes that *size* is all that matters when including a transaction. This is far from true in practice, though. What is really "unfair" is the perverse incentive of only counting size, which promotes using as few signatures as possible and spams the UTXO list, which is a cost supported by everyone. The witness discount only tends to realign the incentives so that cost counts together with the size cost.
As for miners, it is true that, without any pre-consensus, there is a fee rate (much much smaller than 1 sat/vB, by several orders of magnitude) for which discounting size does not pay off the extra propagation costs visavis orphaning risk. However, this becomes irrelevant with modern techniques like fibre and compact-blocks, for which all extra cost is, at the extreme, that of a fixed-size short txid, the same for segwit or non-segwit, big or small.

Yes, miners need to upgrade or use a border node. This is true for **every** softfork; nothing segwit specific here.
With segwit: Nodes can fully verify their transactions. Non-segwit nodes do not receive segwit transactions. Therefore, as long as they do not care about other people's money (and they should not), it is fully opt-in.

It is a rather unusual event: 34 stocks all red and only bitcoin green. Daily returns for a typical stock are more often positive than negative, and global indexes are constructed in a way where their constituents are diverse (i.e., little correlated). The probability for an event like that is likely on the order of 0.001 or lower (rough estimate; difficult because Markovitz model far from accurate on extreme days).

0-conf is insecure, yes, but even then its security is not significantly weakened by segwit (or other softforks): Notice that anyone-can-spend transactions are non-standard and so nodes that do not understand them will not propagate them.
The attack vector consists in the attacker making the double-spend or fake-anyone-can-spend reach the victim. The former is much easier than the latter, in the current network.

No, in reality there are no coins on either chain.
The blockchain contains blocks, which contain transactions. Tokens of value appear as an emergent property only. As a consequence of the fact that the rules for block creation impose scarcity so that we end up having *mainly* a chain instead of, let us say, a tree of blocks.
Bitcoins are thus essentially *proofs of work* that has been provably wasted, with a 21M limit and a four-year-halving target schedule. 
And transactions can happen outside of the blockchain. Currently we say things like that we *carry bitcoins* in an opendime, even if it is a device that has nothing to do with the blockchain. In the same way, Chaum-blinded "bitcoin certificates" (be it the [historical implementation]( or in the newer, more robust, TumbleBit proposal) are proper bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:53:15
It has some merit, but I guess that it largely depends on the economic system that emerges past hyperbitcoinization. 
The first part, "inflation concentrates at the top" is quite undeniable in cases where inflationary currency is specifically fiat or debt-based money (grain-based money, for instance, is also inflationary in a growing economy, but it appears at the bottom): The "top" have access to higher leverage, so they accumulate most of the fresh issuance.
The second part is more debatable. Deflation incentivizes saving ("hodling") over spending, but those at the bottom have a spending pressure that is relatively higher to the one of those at the top. Still, in a work-intensive economy, wealth creation would indeed tend to concentrate at the bottom, while deflation penalizes landlords and resource hoarders.
Notice how this could possibly apply to *proof of work* currencies, but certainly not to *proof of stake* ones.

Bitcoin, as a unit, is an abstraction. The protocol does specify quantities, but their relationship with BTC can be changed (e.g., to add more decimal places). Also, some people prefer alternative units, like *tonal bitcoins*.
When you send bitcoins to someone, most of the times you are actually locking them into a contract that unlocks with one or more signatures. But alternatively you can also "lock" bitcoins to an address that represents a complex smart contract, even an *entire blockchain* running beside the original one.
In this sense, I think that we can properly send bitcoins to and get them from the Lightning Network, as we can send them to and get them from a sidechain.

The main issue is that they run a full-steam propaganda machine against Bitcoin, which is unfortunately effective, especially among users that lack all the historical perspective. 
First impression when you naively look at rbtc is that rBitcoin is censoring out all the opposing views and disallowing "free discussion", while they "unmoderatedly allow it". They will then point at some particular instances where some stupid comment by Roger was downvoted to -100.
It really takes some time looking at the sources and the arguments, engaging in discussions and their post dynamics, to realize that it is indeed rbtc who are banning and rate-limiting most of the opposing views, while only permitting a reduced subset, or that rbitcoin has a strict but clear moderation while rbtc is much more arbitrary, with policy that goes as far as banning and hiding obvious factual truths.

LOL. You might be affected by selection bias. Many of the top alts did not exist a couple of year ago, and some of those that existed back then have now disappeared. 
Long term, only a handful of alts have performed better than Bitcoin  and, while it might appear obvious now, it was certainly not clear back then that they would.
And then, even for the alts that grew more than BTC, they typically did so at huge volatility (see Ripple as an example). 
Bitcoin is on the efficient frontier: It has the best risk/reward ratio.
Leveraged Bitcoin trading outperforms practically all the alts, at equivalent volatility (long term).

No, it is not, because the focal point is in using the core-mandated release. Those devs have super cow powers.
Notice that a hardfork is not a split. A split, as a hardfork, it is a failed one, because cryptocurrencies work and global consensus and splits prevent it. It is even worse in Monero, because the focal point is indeed in hardforking, so in a "rejected hardfork" it would be unclear which is the real Monero.


Google it please, because there are pages and pages with the detailed analysis. But essentially: the assumption that no party has 51% is only reasonable in a situation where reward is proportional to hashrate. If they can decide the connectivity requirements, miners are incentivized to drive out their least connected competitors and eat their share of the pie. This creates a huge centralization force towards big pools, which we have observed in practice in the Ghash era.


Precisely, that lack of dev centralization.

We are a few million today. Current state is enough, even without Segwit. But eventually we will need much bigger blocks, even with Lightning.

A malicious LedgerManager would ask you to do exactly the same, and users have been specifically said to accept and proceed in a case like that.
Hell, for those that have not upgraded yet, a malicious LedgerManager could now be asking users to upgrade from their 1.3.1 to fake-1.4.1, which the SE will accept, instead of the real one.

"Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon" none of these are precisely undervalued; I would not recommend accumulating any of these. They are not bubbles, of course.
Nor is Bitcoin, IMHO, as the class mark of crypto-coins. 
Alts, however, are extremely risky investments. Fundamentally, because any "killer feature" that they may find, could be ported to Bitcoin (as a softfork, hardfork, sidechain, etc.) and benefit from its greater stability and network effect. And empirically: The second alt was Namecoin that has greatly diminished today; the third, Tenebrix, fully gone; once prominent Mastercoin and Nem are nowhere, etc.

Please, take a time to read again Krawisz's and Back's articles that I posted above. They explain how **Bitcoin can have fundamental value, only in the case where, precisely, alts can have none.**


Thus my insistence on the fact that Cryptocurrency *needs by design global consensus*. Of course, fiat-money is in competition with gold-currency and is in competition with cryptocurrency (i.e., Bitcoin). But in crypto, and only in crypto, "there can only be one", as Krawisz explains, because if not it can be infinitely cloned (ergo worthless).


I am afraid that your perception of alts might be strongly affected by survivorship bias. The first alt, Tenebrix, no longer exists and Litecoin is in fact a nearly exact clone of it. Also, where are today Namecoin, Freicoin, Primecoin, Novacoin, Feathercoin, etc., all of them once prominent? 


Nonsense. LN is Bitcoin. It is, essentially, transaction replaceability (which was already there in the very first version in 2009) and as such it modifies nothing of the consensus system. Bitcoin transactions are formed by scripts, they are smart contracts. Making a creating use, as LN does, instead of plain on-chain pay-to-address does not make it "less Bitcoin". LN is thus analogous to multisig or to BIP70 payment requests, which nobody would ever define as "alts".


Me too I trade alts and cash out to Bitcoin. Observe please what this sentence says: Which asset is the unit of account (even if somewhat unconsciously) and which is the speculative asset.

Assumption 1 is mostly, but not fully, correct. Actually, there are evidences that Bitcoin's use as a store of value predates its use as a currency. It could also have been held initially as some sort of nerdy collectible, probably. Anyway, it escapes Mises' regression theorem: 
Assumption 2 is not correct. Neither population nor "prosperity" can be expected to grow indefinitely. In fact, a Bitcoin economy may well be one of the few that are degrowth-compatible naturally (while, in contrast, in the current system, even zero growth provokes severe crisis). Still, coins get lost over time eventually granting supply deflation. With this, BTC can indeed appreciate over time without violating the efficient market hypothesis:

It is centralized both at the network level (because nobody runs nodes) and at the coin distribution level (because it was largely premined). The former is issue is a fundamental one, rooted on poor design decisions -- with all that Turing complete insanity at the base of this. This implies that it will need constant tweaking and repricing, indefinitely, and thus permanent centralized steering.
The worst of that is that, if Ethereum's use case proved useful some day (I doubt it, but I could be wrong), it would the get disrupted by one of its equally centralized but more streamlined competitors, like EOS.

That only purple unicorns now. 
The closest to that is probably a hardware wallet, but you still need to copy its backup seed on paper (or better, punch it on titanium plaque, or a good stainless steel).
However, there is a simple trick to ensure recoverablilty and avoid theft risk to a decent extent. Make two sets of your recovery seed and split each of them in three shares, then store separately (assuming 24 words):
 - Location I: one share with words number 1-8 and one with 9-16
 - Location II: words 1-8 and 17-24
 - Location III: words 9-16 and 17-24
with this, you would need to visit any two of the three locations to recovery your backup. One of the locations could get compromised and you would still be good, and one of the locations could get destroyed and you would sill be good.

If you do not run a node, you are instead using other people's nodes or, said differently, **other people are *using Bitcoin* on your behalf**.
Signing your own transactions is only part of the picture and, in the end, it depends on how you define things: E.g., are Robinhood or Square-cash customers that buy bitcoins on the app *using Bitcoin*? Only in a way, and dependently on how broad you want to make the definition.
Light nodes have weaker security and privacy, and they need to minimally trust their servers, in some edge cases. Other than that, they free ride on them. Bitcoin is robust and it can withstand a relatively large proportion of this kind of free riders but, at some point, stressing it too much makes decentralization fall apart. I think that we are seeing that effect on the Ethereum network, where practically nobody run full nodes anymore.

Yes, of course. In one case you get robbed immediately right after getting owned, and in the other right after you upgrade and use the device. So it is actually equivalent to storing your wallet file in a pendrive.


This is the tricky part. Typically you would detect that the update is not legitimate from your Ledger Manager (which is compromised, in that scenario), and from the secure-element attestation (which it bypasses). So you would be SOL in that case.
Firmware is 2-years old. Saleem found the exploit back in November. This is being fixed now, OK, but it has been vulnerable for a while.

There, "activate Segwit" refers specifically to BIP141, which removes the 1MB block size limit. Blocks can be up to 4MB now. If you further limit the "base block size" to 2MB, that is a softfork, not a hardfork.

The major disagreement is probably in Eric's "requires physical access to the device BEFORE setup of the seed", which looks indeed unlikely, and a significant downplay on the fact that that could be achieved too remotely by a malicious LedgerManager asking to do a firmware upgrade.

Interesting piece by The main difference with BIP39 is that it is invariant to the order of the words, which is something that sometimes decreases the memorability of mnemonics.
Another difference is that it is reversible, so you can use stuff like the Shamir's secret sharing scheme to split your seed in m-of-n shares that are each mnemonics themselves.
The main drawback is that it needs twice as many words for a similar level of security.

Excellent explanation, thanks.
Some people imagine the blockchain as a perfect chain in which honorable miners respectfully wait for their turns to extend the tip. In reality, we have a block-tree stemming from the genesis block and, only because of economic incentives, miners will converge *eventually* to preferentially extend the same tip.
If you remove the incentives, like the "21M soft cap" that makes bitcoins valuable, or size limits that make hashrate-reward proportional (which is what prevents 51%), then consensus is lost.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:43:25
Yes. That is pretty much the hypothesis being tested. 
One could thing about a price-fixing cartel where the objective is just *to set a minimal fee, but not attack the network in any other way*. However, no, it does not work, because the only way the cartel would have to punish defectors would be through a full-blown 51% attack. A cartel that cannot punish its defectors is, essentially, one that does not exist in practice or, said differently, one that can only fix the price to its free-market value.
Notice that Antpool can still voluntarily renounce to part of its demand, but then it is only irrationally diminishing its payoff (a.k.a. shooting itself in the foot) and, by extension, that of the miners that mine at it.

As such, it has a stronger dependency on the gatekeepers - I do not think that something like UASF would have stood a chance in Monero (as it did in Bitcoin), and it has a gameable adaptive blocksize limit, which would have set blocksizes probably close to 100MB and concentrated in a couple of pools by the time it would have suffered its first spam attack.

As I started my paragraph: "you are phished to a malicious Ledger Manager". Attacker could also social engineer you, e.g., via email from Ledger saying something like "old Ledger Manager is compromised, please install asap this fixed version at chrome.google.com/webstore/blablblablabla".

Individually, for you, it would be around half of that (depends on the transaction structure; how many signatures).

Keep in mind that, in the simplest case, the remote+social-engineering attack will just ask the user to put the device in bootloader and accept the "legit, we promise" upgrade. But this is exactly what users have been asked to do two weeks ago with the recent official upgrade.
Seed extraction would require an additional social-engineering step, but official upgrade guide too instructs users to redo their seed (if they upgrade from older than 1.3.1), so that would not be suspicious at all. 
Alternatively, no "seed confirmation" step is required to empty the wallet:  the malicious firmware on a compromised computer could do other funny stuff, like simply and automatically bypassing the signing confirmation for a transaction that sends all the coins to the attacker.

Miners are always forced to upgrade; this is the case for all softforks, evil or not.
Neither BIP141, nor BIP91 or BIP-compulsory-witness-commit force anything on non-mining nodes. They can still fully validate transactions made to them if they do not upgrade (yes, they cannot validate segwit transactions, but this is irrelevant as they will not send them or receive them in the first place, which is the case for all the unknown and the vast majority of non-standard transactions).

Could be. Spammers see spamming is futile with a working LN that is already there (albeit still in some unpolished form) - they can no longer play the "but vaporware!" card.
More generally, you can --of course!-- benefit from segwit and the LN even if you do not use them directly, as their use takes away some of the load and thus makes place for legacy transactions.

Come on, poll interpretation is not that hard: You cannot count those that did not answer, because they would not go vote either in a referendum. 65% of people said that they wanted rupture (be it full independence or free associated state, which is a position that would require at least a brief independence first) and only 35% wanted status quo or less autonomy. 


You might be surprised, but most of independentism is in the periphery and unionists are most concentrated in the regional capital.
That said, I think that the answer would be yes. The independence process is being mostly motivated on the right of self-determination, so it would be quite absurd to deny that right at the smaller scales, even if that would imply redefining the current regional borders. In that case, to be fair, that would need to be extended to both sides of the border and then I would not be surprised if villages in the Matarraña or Ebro's delta would decide to join a Catalan state. Even some enclaves would not be a big problem, especially in a case where there would not be physical borders.


Sure they are! Next referendum in Spain would be about the monarchy, and then probably about the Euro. Spanish ruling party, Partido Popular, is the least voted one in Catalan regional elections, so it is not strange that most Catalans do not feel well represented in Spain.


I agree. I would propose a Spanish-sponsored referendum that requires 75% participation and 60% support. Or even a non-binding vote. But the problem is that president Rajoy has made quite clear that he would never allow that. So what should they do then?

It would be difficult to find a *worse* example for the point that you were trying to prove.

You are not wrong, but it is too late now. LN is a free-and-open-source, open-developed, permissionless system, so that situation is unavoidable. 
You cannot really know with absolute certainty whether mainnet use is a consequence of bitcoiner's over-excitement, or an attack to slow down its development. The effect is mostly the same in one case or the other, so in the end, because of its inevitability, it does not really matter.

Can cryptocurrency really achieve limited supply without a central authority? If yes, then there is only place for one. If not, then keep cloning: They are fundamentally worthless.
Cryptocurrency solves the double spending problem by requiring *global consensus* on the chainstate. Litecoin nodes cannot achieve consensus with Bitcoin, so they solve nothing.

A "code update" that is also a hardfork, and as such it is almost guaranteed to lead to a consensus loss, network split, and blockchain subbranching, unless everyone "updates". Code has been formally released, deployed, and it is currently running in the wild; it will fork.

Because Bitcoin is not proof-of-work alone. 
In fact, maybe you are too young to remember it, but during the first halvening, there was indeed an "infinite inflation" attempt, where a (rather sizable) group of miners went to mine a 50BTC-forever chain. The fork was largely rejected by users, and it died quickly due to its lack of wipeout protection.
And indeed this is the proof: There is no need to create 12.5BTC per block. 10BTC would be perfectly valid, and actually much beneficial collectively. Yet, it never happens. Miners individually claim as much as they can, even if this degrades the collective value of the system. This is basic economic theory.
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:52:28
Absurd. How long do you think a premined Bitcoin would have gone?
For ICO projects that are centralized, the "blockchain technology" aspect is purely superfluous and could be done simpler and more robust just with multisig in most cases, or remote attestation in the more complex ones.
For ICO projects that are decentralized (are there any though?), they can be duplicated at no cost *sans* the premine part, so they are ultimately worthless.
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:42:51


What? No, not at all! Bitcoin can only work on block-validity rules (vs. other systems like Counterparty, which work on proof-of-publication and can tolerate invalid blocks). See 
Bitcoin is proof-of-work with inflation-control. The inflation-control is extremely hard, as it needs global consensus (peer-to-peer payments generally do not, see e.g., RipplePay - the original "true" Ripple). 
That claim "bitcoin is the longest proof of work chain" is extremely strong, as it leads to unlimited inflation. AFAIAW nobody in BTC1 agrees with that view. Not even Faketoshi or Roger Ver do.


That is not my impression. It is hard to argue that there is a really urgent need for a HF increase. Even when blocks "were full", most of the transactions were long chains (mainly by centralized tumblers a.k.a. honeypots and other spammers), not by genuine use. That said, is undeniable that genuine use is getting there and that we will soon need bigger blocks (probably as soon as next year). 
This needs to happen via real widespread consensus, though, not via closed door meetings. 
I support bigger blocks, not turning Bitcoin into a corporatocracy.

Its only innovation is that it is the only one decentralized. All the others are built around some sort of undethronabled Foundation, trusted central party (also known as witnesses, delegates, gateways or masternodes), for-profit private company, or dev team. To make it even worse, most of the times that central entity has pre-sold, pre-mined or insta-mined a big chunk of the total supply (if not all of it).

Well, that was pretty much the point in this thread. People will value it lowly, yet Coinbase, Xapo and Gemini will still call it *Bitcoin
And since you mention game theory, notice that the *individual* incentives for miners are to claim as much as possible as reward (e.g., reward of 10BTC would be valid, but all of them claim 12.5BTC). The *collective* incentives would be claim as little as possible, but they collide with the individual ones. Therefore, absent a "block reward limit" you have a Tragedy of the Commons. The same is true for block sizes too, to the extent that they are capable of breaking the hashrate/reward proportionality.

"ASIC resistant" is an oxymoron. Any computational process that runs repeatedly (and deterministically) on general hardware will run more efficiently on specialized hardware. *Memory hard* is the best we can do, and it is trivially solved by attaching RAM modules to the ASIC. RAM+minimal controller will always be cheaper and consume less energy than a general purpose GPU.


They keep repeating that lie, but that does not make it true. Everything indicates that there will be two  thriving sub-chains. There will be two sub-coins: Bitcoin (as per BIP2 definition) and the hardforked 2x coin. Users will want both. Those companies will have to offer both to their users; they will have to deal with coin splitting without clean replay protection.


Its entirety? They are not even a majority, bitcoin-weighted.


I agree. It will happen if something gets broken, or against an existential threat, but no, we should not risk entering a potentially disastrous split just to get an "update". 


Not true: 
Core devs are unanimously rejecting a reckless hardfork; they do not seem to have much problem with a safe one.
Also, "base block size increase" does not make sense, because there is no base block size limit. Call it for what it is: 8MB block weight increase, even though experts said only 4MB are safe (before centralization forces star having a non-negligible effect).

What 2x proponents say is that, essentially, you can concentrate exclusively on the header chain (this is why they will not touch the header or tx validity rules). Apparently, they fail to realize that this approach can easily get rid of the "inflation control" aspect. In other words, that some can modify the 21M hardcoded constant  in a closed-door meeting.

It was a full double spend, not opt-in RBF or first-seen-safe or anything. The exchange showed both deposits as pending, but obviously only credited the one that confirmed.
Zero-confirmation is not even incentive incompatible, it is also impossible in any reliable way, even in a network full of super-honest profit-minimizing nodes like Bcash.

That is precisely what I said. 
The white paper talks about *consensus* in the distributed-computing sense. That *consensus* is based on the validation of a certain set of block validity rules.
In his tweet, Charlie is talking about the *social consensus* that would be required to change those rules.
Like it or not, Bitcoin requires *block validity consensus* by design. Other systems, like proofchains, can relax that to just *proof of publication*, but not Bitcoin or Bitcoin-like systems. See this article:

Previous block was 17s earlier. Those people have very serious connectivity issues, as it normally should not take more than a fraction of a second to get a block:

The confusion is that the NYA says 2MB not 8MB. With Segwit alone, blocks can already grow to 2MB (and up to 4MB worst case).
NYA explicitly talked about activating BIP141 "bit1" as it had already been deployed in most nodes. However, 8MB block weight limit is completely different from BIP141. It simply does not make sense to activate something and then substitute it for something different right after. Many devs assumed that "hardfork to 2MB base size" meant that non-segwit tx get also the BIP141 witness discount; this would make more sense than 8MB, which creates an unacceptable centralizing force (Cornell study).
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:49:03


This seems to ignore that Segwit is itself an effective doubling of the blocksize (with 4MB worst case). For me, either Segwit or a 2MB increase alone would be fine. But it is the doubling on top of Segwit (8MB) that is unnecessary now and could be problematic.


There is no such thing as a "Core's BIP approval process". BIPs are by definition cross-implementation, so clearly not Core. There is no "approval" either, other than peer review.

But then difficulty jumps and advantage levels off, so the spammer-miner is less profitable than its non-spamming competitors.
So this can only happen in case of a monpolistic mining cartel. Interestingly, in that case the optimal fee revenue occurs when blocks are not full.
A monopolistic mining cartel is disastrous for other reasons (resilience and censorship resistance, mostly) way more severe than high tx fees. **Full blocks are therefore a health indicator in permissionless blockchains**, contrary to what snake oil sellers often claim.
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:17:29
Bcash has more blocks than Bitcoin. Why is not it more valuable? And the testnet chain, and Litecoin, have even more blocks. Where is that "increased utility" represented?
Experience shows that the block rate is quite secondary in determining value. [As Krawisz says]( 


So it is mainly the users, not the block rate (or other technological aspects), what makes the tokens valuable. Look at how many are running Bitcoin and how many are running Segwit2x (not talking about the manipulable "number of reachable nodes"; ask your peers what nodes are they running).

If I understand it correctly, the forking block is clearly set in stone 
 so no, we will not need to worry about splitting until after 25th.
There is no replay protection yet, but this is not a problem, as the actual launch will probably not happen before December, so it will be ready by then. Since it is a hardfork that changes POW, there is no need to keep in sync with the original chain; you can launch from **any** block in the past.
The article seems confused about the premine. It was speculated that it would be a secret, regular insta-mining, but now it seems that it will be a proper premine, that is, forking block defines a set of new outputs that belong to the devs (yes, still scammy as fuck).

"Greg Maxwell w/ Blockstream" conspiracy?
Greg Maxwell has never left Bitcoin. He does not work for Blockstream anymore. Even when he worked there, he had a generous special clause that let him quit and still be paid for a year, if he perceived that there was any conflict of interest between Blockstream and Bitcoin: 
Grandparent said of those that quited Bitcoin "They thought they were the leaders. Then they realized bitcoin community doesn't like leaders and doesn't want a dictator. Then they became sour pusses and left. Probably pumping a shitcoin. "
Maxwell has rarely taken position as a leader. Look beyond rbtc propaganda and judge for yourself. This is his personal hardfork wishlist:  Contrary to others, he has never tried to push any of those ideas. "Confidential transactions" is probably his only proposal that would modify the consensus layer of Bitcoin, and it is something will probably never be rolled out anyway (especially if we get a MimbleWimble extension block).
Maxwell has never become a sour puss, nor left Bitcoin either. And he is, of course, not pumping any shitcoin.

Polls from  ; it is  a 4-option poll: "Which relationship between Catalonia and Spain would you prefer? Full independence, State freely associated to a (non-existent) Federal Spain, Autonomous province (status quo), or undifferentiated region." Full independence is consistently the preferred option. E.g., in the last poll, it had 35% support vs. 30% for status quo, 22% for freely associated state and 5% for undifferentiated region. At the 2013 peak, it was 49% for full independence vs. 19%, 21% and 5% respectively.
Other than that, the regional election, which had much more quorum, the coalition that got 48% of the votes was unambiguously called "together for yes" 
 To be precise, JxSi got 40% and the also unambiguously independentist CUP got 8%. Unionists for comparison got 39%. The rest of the parties, unaligned, namely Podemos and Catalan Democratic Union, have over a third of independentist voters, according to the same CEO polls.

It is true that "multi layer" aspect has been largely developed more recently (blockchains have poor scalability; LN is a breakthrough in itself). However, I do not think it is fair to say that Bitcoin is turning multi-layered now. Multi-layer was, arguably, part of the original design (script, nSequence, etc.) and many 2nd layer aspects have been included years ago, like payment requests, coinjoin/cut-through, legacy "Spillman-style" payment channels or lighthouse.

No, not necessarily. Threshold signatures can be more advantageous in an organization or association, where there is a point in keeping the multisig scheme private or who signed what.
Nevertheless, I would bet that the most current use of multiple signatures today is probably for malware resistance (signing from multiple devices). In this case, the fact that the user requires only minimal interaction between the devices compensates the loss of privacy.

Actually, at least some time ago we used to talk about "one-way-pegged" sidechains based on proof of burn, and then "two-way-pegged" sidechains that could come back with a spv proof.
One-way-pegged sidechains are safer, as they can recover after a 51% attack.
Two-way pegging has some advantages. However, in practice and in the long run, either the sidechain fails and destroys all the value in it, or it succeeds and it becomes the *new* Bitcoin. And in this case, you do not want the risk that a 51% attack permanently destroys it.

"Fanatic" is quite pejorative in that context, especially since we were not talking about Faith or beliefs. 
Also, notice that my statement:


is not even a personal opinion, but a direct consequence of the commonly shared BIP2 definition for *Bitcoin*. I recognize that "altcoin" can have a negative load for some, but for me it simply means "not Bitcoin". I guess that I could have called the 2x token other things, like invalid-subbranch-coin or alternate-validity-rules-coin, but it is clear that as long as it does not have widespread consensus behind it, it is not Bitcoin. There are no trademarks on "Bitcoin", so in the end how you define it is a social issue. You are free to use other definitions, but as long as they are not widely shared by others, they are not very useful.
For what is worth, my personal opinion is that I do support bigger blocks, eventually bigger than what Segwit enables, but only once their upgrade mechanisms get widespread consensus behind. I.e., I do not support schisms  where a significant part of the ecosystem is left behind, even if it was a 1.01MB hardfork or even if Core foolishly pushed for them.

It is not. Many single-key paper wallets hide the private key, precisely to keep it private, until it is opened and swept.
If you just import, most of your less technical users will be at risk. Many will leave the paper showing the private key, thus exposed to theft. Many others will simply discard the paper and forget about it, and make no additional backup (they already backed up the wallet seed and think that this is enough); they will lose their funds when their device fails or gets lost or stolen and their backup does not restore the imported keys.
Single-key wallets are obsolete now that we have standard deterministic wallets. If users still have some of these and want to import them, **you f*ing fully sweep them**, or otherwise risk losing your funds.

Notice also that there is no such thing as *block signaling* for hardforks. *Block signaling* is a safety mechanism for softforks.

The system that you describe is a poor voting system because the ballot is not secret: the organizer knows the identities of the wallet holders.
Essentially, you will always need a central organizer that distributes the voting material between the registered voters (eligible individuals). This implies that there is already a central trust to this organizer. Many modern e-vote systems are designed in a way where the organizer cannot lie about the results, while the ballots are still blinded. See, e.g., 
Usually, when the voter has a way to prove that her vote was accounted for and the results are public, then the voter has the ability to unblind her ballot and reveal her voting. This means that the system is vulnerable to vote extortion and vote buying.

The point of having a paper wallet is, quite precisely, that it has not touched an online computer. This is the only reason that it is safe.
Then, when you spend it, it is no longer good and you should discard it and send to a *fresh* paper wallet instead. (which you have no way to test it without compromising it too)
At that point, it is fully equivalent to just having your wallet.dat on an external pen drive.

"Hidden" is not the same as actually *hidden*. Most of transactioning in Monero is for speculating on centralized exchanges, which know very well the quantities involved. As for the handful of legitimate users, they mostly use web wallets, which also know well the quantities.
Actual privacy comes from closed transaction loops (thus not touching exchanges), even better if off-chain on a second layer.
The issue with Monero is that it is so unscalable that it is almost guranteed to stay in that non-private state forever.

It is actually slightly less secure: Quantum computers could advantageously [find the private key from the public key]( but they have nearly zero advantage in preimage attacks (to invert hash functions).
However, AFAICT, the major reason from moving to pubkeys to pubkey hashes was that, at that time, pubkeys were uncompressed so the "addresses" were 512-bit long. Therefore, hashing to form 160-bit-long addresses simplified sending bitcoins (256-bit ECDSA has 128-bit effective complexity, so 160 bits are more than enough).

The way I understand it, miners are supposed to vote for the maximum size they could support. If a miner can support a given limit, it can also support a smaller limit.
It makes sense to make the new limit something acceptable by the 80% of the current miners. Therefore, if at some point we realize that our previous increase was too optimistic, and in consequence the current limit is too high for more that 20%, the limit should decrease. If we require 80% for a decrease, it will probably never happen and we will have the 20+ leave instead, which benefits the better connected majority.

Sorry to tell you, but this is indeed quite biased and influenced by that absurd Segwit2x's "2mb" narrative.


"Recent" nodes (code not older than 1year) do no longer perform that check. The block size limit has been removed and there is instead a *block weight* limit, which definitely weighs the witness part too.
The NYA mentioned 2MB blocksizes, which is what we have accessible now just with Segwit. Btc1 is actually proposing 8MB weight limit (8MB worst case), which was nowhere mentioned in the NYA.


No it is not. Those blocks will almost certainly be bigger than 2MB, and they could soon approach ~4MB.


Only that "miner support" is meaningless. 40% of the miners that had been indicating support for "NYA" quickly jumped to Bcash when that became more profitable. Miners will follow the money, not the other way around. And those that fail to do so will be quickly outcompeted by those that do.
Notice also that there is no such thing as *block signaling* for hardforks. That is a useful thing for softforks, as a safety mechanism;  for hardforks, a split is guaranteed unless support is exactly 100%, so signaling is meaningless.


Meaningless; see above.


**Bullshit strawman.** From my experience, few people (if any) here defend 1MB blocks. Especially since we already have blocks bigger than that. Also, most agree with the possibility of a hardfork, as long as it has widespread consensus.
Now, my opinion: I think that it is quite clear that Segwit2x is not about the blocksize but about firing Core. It is not a scaling upgrade but a corporatocratic attack.

Ripple Labs controls a majority of the validators. You know this.
If they wanted, they could block *blacklisted* transactions even forge and accept invalid transactions (i.e., against the protocol). There is no historic consistency in Ripple (Even the first ledgers have been lost forever, even though the main net today progresses on top of these).
Of course, using such arbitrary alterations would destroy Ripple's reputation; Ripple Labs knows this. They prefer to led the justice decide.

*plain old paper wallets* are only good if you know perfectly what you are doing.
They encourage address reuse, which not only limits your privacy but also that of your payers and payees. You are supposed to fully sweep the private keys (and not just import them) to make a transaction, and then use a fresh address as the change address. Also, if you have announced the address once to the public, you should never discard used papers, because one of your payers might decide to send again to these.

@_date: 2017-10-12 18:18:46
But that is not *being neutral*. Being neutral implies presenting things as factually accurate as possible and their direct logical consequences, with language that is as little loaded as possible. You do not have to "present both views", especially if one sides' points are full of logical fallacies and non-sequiturs.
Bitcoin is a system that requires [distributed consensus]( ). This implies a set of validity rules that must be kept. When some do not, consensus is lost, the network splits and the "no-double-spending" guarantees fall apart. Technically, the 1MB rule is one of those (but in practice that is not especially restrictive, as actual blocksizes can be still increased in practice, as with Segwit).
That consensus requirement implies that any "protocol upgrade" that modifies the set of rules (also known as a **hard fork**) will require unanimous support. Otherwise, it will create a new incompatible-rule blockchain, different from the valid Bitcoin one. This is commonly defined as an *altcoin*.
Therefore, it is literal doublespeak when the Segwit2x side says that such a *hard fork* is just a "protocol upgrade". They literally lie when they claim that 85% hashrate support makes it safe. No, sorry, it does not; even 99% vs. 1% is not. You cannot use hashrate percentages as support indicators (for *social consensus*, which is totally unrelated to the technical *distributed consensus* mentioned above). 
So current hashrate percentages are meaningless. The value of coins will determine what miners do, and the hashrate will follow (this is not speculation: the Bcash hardfork evidenced this). I have the impression that coin holders and other downline users are mostly against the Segwit2x coup attempt (fair term: Btc1 team has unambiguously expressed that they intend to replace Core as Bitcoin's *reference implementation*). Bitfinex futures support that view.

In the end, the trust network either operates at an unsafe regime or it reduces to a hierarchical network with a (centralized) core made of classical, fixed-number-of-players Byzantine fault tolerance.
Let us consider a Ripple world as it would have been before the 90's: Every individual would trust the central bank issuing the currency/IOU that they commonly use. Then, central banks would trust the others in their economical federation, but this would imply that the network has two hierarchical cores: one around the North Atlantic block and the other around the Soviet block, with several scattered non-aligned nodes (central banks?) acting as a hinge with trust in both directions. The moment the local consensus between the two cores disagree, the network would have globally irreconcilably split into an OECD-Ripple and a Comecon-Ripple.
This setting, in today's terms, could effectively keep consensus, but only with an overpowered central-influencer IMF leading the core of the top-tier central banks.

Blockchains need the right incentives that discourage reorganizations. Transfers of value can do this *intrinsically* (e.g., coinbases or fees). However, if you can instead *externally force* this security -through centralization or federation- then you do not need a blockchain! 
Have a look at `git`: It is distributed, it keeps a transparent history that, as long as others keep it, cannot be tampered with, it can sign every commit, it can garbage collect and stay tidy, and everything is basically an efficient, well tested structure: a Merkle tree. Because of these, the uses of git apply to much more than source code (e.g., etckeeper or git-home-history).

Mining hardware is expensive and it gets outdated rather quickly. This means that miners value critically their short term profitability.
Now, a network schism will certainly impact the price for a while. Therefore, unless there is a huge support (which is hard to assess) behind XT, miners have the incentive to derail the forking process through triggering a minority activation.
They can do this in a simpler way: run XT and switch back to Core after activation, i.e., there is no need to mine with trollish/unmaintained software.

Having all your seeds pass through a same computer looks problematic. If that computer gets compromised, the attacker can easily bypass any protection password and encryption scheme that you use. 
Furthermore, the protection offered by ZIP passwords is significantly weak, and Word has had problems too. Word is not future proof and it forces you to have a licence accessible.
Which wallet is it? Core? If it is multi-platform, you can split between PC and phone or tablet and avoid that risk. In that case, the necessary degree of protection to each seed is much less critical.

A general purpose OS like Android has already multiple sources of abundant entropy, and it can be inputted a diceware "salt" too.
Since you target the non-technical users, please add at least a big warning on the papers clearly stating that they are supposed to be **used only once**, that the private keys should be **fully swept** and this only right before sending a transaction, that the remaining change should be **sent to a fresh paper wallet** and finally, that used paper wallets should ideally **never be discarded**.

If a given limit is sustainable for a miner, then it is good also for miners that voted for more. Conversely, a limit that is too much for someone may be good by its competing miners that voted for more. Let us suppose a proposed increase that is considered *too much* by 20% of the miners or more. If they are not able to block it, then they might be forced out. 
Losing^* 20% of the hashing power in 3 months looks like a worrisome centralizing tendency to me.
^(* The hashing power itself may not be lost because miners would stop to *properly mine* and instead sell their hashing power by pointing it to a centralized pool in exchange for a reward. Anyway the centralizing effect is the same; if you do not build your blocks, you are not really mining.)

Bitcoin transactions can do much more than A-&gt;B transfers. They can execute smart contracts in a trustless, automated way. The LN profits from this to transfer the bitcoins between different Bitcoin transactions, which can be settled (sent to be mined) eventually if needed, but there is no need. 
Using Bitcoin is not just spending UTXOs. The LN can become an integral part of Bitcoin just like the p2p message protocol, the payment request network, the block relay network or the pooling protocols.

10' is enough for most types of money transfers, except payments. Some payments (in store, digital delivery, etc.) need to be instantaneous. Not 1' average; instant.
This is why sending to addresses (push-style, non interactive) is terrible for payments, which ideally need to happen on their own layer on top of the blockchain (and not an altchain or sidechain). 
The payment request protocol was the first step in that direction and the Lightning network looks like it would be the next. Off-chain, trustless and instant.

Well, once it is compromised, we have already lost. It does not really matter that much if it is just a signature or the whole master key, because the malware would forge an empty-the-whole-wallet transaction anyway.
You are right about the need of simultaneity. However, malware can reside silently for a long time. The vast majority of android devices run outdated, vulnerable versions of the Linux kernel (hey, even exploits for Nexus devices regularly appear!) and many get never patched (my 2011 Samsung phone has never got an update). Consequently, simultaneous or non-simultaneous attacks are not that different in practice.
Of course, using 3 devices would be safer than using 2, but my point is that the difference is negligible in practice. You insist in the opposite only because you have a product to sell.

Centralized solutions can actually be very efficient. If you only care about crypto-attestation, but not about censurability, then they are preferable over decentralized solutions. Look at Ripple as the paradigm of this: It is centrally controlled (but redundant, with distributed servers), it does not need any mining, it has ~2-second blocks, transactions are practically free (yet freezable) and it incorporates a transparent IOU exchange. Its premined token of value XRP is worthless (in exponential decay since launch), but it retains a non-zero value, which is all it needs for spam prevention. Its dev team has registered as an MSB and, after a massive FinCEN fine, they are now forcing KYC validation on every user of their (open source!) software. In short: They are a nice (transparent and crypto-attested) PayPal competitor.
However, if you want a trustless, permissionless, honeybadger-like monetary system like Bitcoin, then you need decentralization.

I understand -and accept- that Bitcoin is different things to different people. That said, notice that the Bitcoin project has not really had any governance or established policies, *ever*. The existence of The Bitcoin Foundation (and some of its actions) may have given the impression of some sort of policy building and direction, but in reality they never represented Bitcoin in any way.
Since launch, the code has changed a lot, but only at a technical level. It has been re-architectured to be more efficient, bugs have been solved, and **neutral** features have been added. Things that are politically sensible, like affecting privacy or decentralization, have always stayed the same:
 - Mining went from CPU to GPU to FPGA to highly specialized ASICs. There have been no changes to more memory intensive algorithms despite the steep centralization. No group has enforced any decentralization policy on the evolution of Bitcoin, even if this is one of its core elements.
 - Similarly, pooled mining concentrates even further the creation of blocks. p2pool and GBT are still minor players and since long ago centralized block creation rules the Bitcoin blockchain. Still, no change in Bitcoin to follow any policy on this.
 - Charged aspects like anonymity have not made into the protocol either, nor into the reference implementation (we can even claim that there is no reference implementation, just a popular one, since Bitcoin will accept any valid blocks independent of the software that made them). Privacy depends on the collective, because Bitcoin has a lot of traceability, and so deanonymizing one step can unveil the whole trace. Yet, CoinJoin or Stealth Addresses are not into the core. The same for Zerocoin or ring signatures. 
This is why I said that Bitcoin is essentially a set of rules, and not a set of man-led policies.

I do not think that there are economic systems unconditionally superior to others. Capitalism has proved to be the best in a socioeconomic/civilizational context of rapid exponential growth (industrial revolution(s)), but it is clearly weak in times of not only degrowth but just stagnation. In the current system, simple lack of growth is already catastrophic: unemployment, inequality, poverty and insecurity raise during those periods. This is something that is *acceptable enough* only in a context of permagrowth (which is physically impossible).

About one month ago, I accepted that I will need to shut down my node rather soon. Any block size increase would be too much for me; I am OK with this: I am glad that Bitcoin is expanding with more users and user cases.
However, with all this I realize how urgently we need to develop SPV clients. In the whitepaper, Satoshi describes SPV as simplified validation (headers and own UTXOs) when we see only one chain, but falling back to full validation if we see more than one. All current so called "SPV" clients do only the first simplified part but then accept any longest chain (valid or invalid), and so they are less secure than a full node.
On the other hand, non-mining full nodes cannot ensure censorship resistance, and with the increasing difficulty, any significant mining operation might be soon able to afford a business tier connection as a minor cost, anywhere in the world.
I wonder if we could have a satisfactory solution where only miners and major players run full nodes, while we still stay decentralized and untraceable. Some things that I think that we would need:
 - Complete SPV mode with trustless programmable alerts.
 - SPV enhancements like header UTXO commitments and proofs of fraud.
 - Meni's pool of fees. If not, miners are disincentivized to propagate the transactions and they keep them for themselves instead.
 - Tor hidden services for pushing transactions and for querying own UTXOs. Route each request through a new circuit (currently in Electrum there are some hidden services available, but you tell them which of your addresses go together so deanonymizing one reveals your full wallet).
When all of these get implemented, then maybe the catastrophic decline of full nodes will not be that problematic and we may let them get further decimated with an increase in the block size limit (after all, the sticking point with critical centralization is more in mining than in non-mining nodes; huge blocks could centralize mining because necessary connectivity is a base cost, because fees in half full blocks approach the marginal cost of non-orphaned relaying, and because *selfish mining* becomes more profitable, but a moderate increase is probably survivable).
@_date: 2015-09-08 10:14:37
A hardfork requires that everyone upgrades. The other time, it was because of a critical bug, so the decision was nearly unanimous. 
Now, for the block size limit everyone agrees that it needs to be raised, but there is no consensus on how. I wish that we reach a compromise as soon as possible, because any change will be better done now than in the future when Bitcoin is more consolidated.
Ideally (and without new bugs) this would be the last hardfork (or we could even avoid it and make it as a softfork with *extended blocks*). After this, we should make libconsensus --with a robust softforking protocol-- and put an end to dev centralization.
All subsequent experimental or exploratory changes could be done in a much safer way in the form of sidechains. This way, they are permissionless, they allow free competition without diluting value, and it does not require any consensus, governance or policy.

This is elementary Economic theory. In a free market, abundant capacity implies that any fee that outweighs the marginal cost of its inclusion (through increased risk of orphaning) should be included. Therefore, fees would race to the bottom, until a point where the increased demand fills the blocks.
What in reality happens is that either miners do not care about fees (they are still much smaller than the block subsidy) and so they leave the default values, or that they explicitly or implicitly act like a cartel (though this would be strange because there is no effective way to punish defectors).

Fully pruned mode is probably the closest thing to "client-only mode" that we have.
SPV as described in the whitepaper is not much practical in the sense that it still needs to download and validate full blocks in case of conflict. 
Maybe we could introduce UTXO commits in the blocks? This would define a set of pseudo-geneses and, while still not full nodes, they would [reduce the cost to start a node]( with the same guarantees excluding long-range reorganizations.

This is a very relevant point. Firstly, because Ripple Labs keeps defining their fiat tokens as IOUs, but this points evidences how they are not:
 - Tradable IOUs can be traded in what is called a secondary market. It is this secondary market (the Ripple network, in our case) and not the issuer (Bitstamp, the gateway) the one that sets the environment and conditions for trading.
 - IOUs have contractual terms defined at issuance. Freezability was rolled out retroactively (**!**), i.e., a fundamental property of the product -*fungibility*- was altered in the middle of its life.

Bitcoin blocks are limited to a maximum size of 1MB. BIP101 is a currently controversial proposal to eventually increase this size limit.
P2Pool is a decentralized pool: Each miner in the pool attempts to build blocks that share the rewards according to their relative computing power (they measure this with a simplified, quicker blockchain that makes the pooling trustless).
Therefore, the miner that finds the block can indicate support for BIP101, depending on the full node that built the block (in this case, BitcoinXT or notBitcoinXT).

The basic idea that I understood:
Ethereum contracts can be perfectly copied; sidechain pegging transactions cannot.
In Ethereum, honest contracts based on oracles (let us say, external feeds) can be perfectly copied by *parasite contracts* for nearly zero cost, and then subverted, i.e., they are effectively useless. However, the truthcoin sidechain will avoid this problem thanks to the pegging to the value of Bitcoin's blockchain and its merged-mined hashing power.
As a corollary, Ethereum superiority to Bitcoin gets restricted to non-oracle cases like casino games and maybe some obscure IoT vaporware uses.
Gavin used a very similar argumentation in [his own rebuttal to Ethereum]( Maybe you can find that one easier to follow.

You can stop here. If 51% are malicious it is practically a game over. 
It is sometimes said that a 51% attack can only censor, not steal, but this is not fully correct as long as you consider that they can pull arbitrarily long-range reorganizations.
The exact same thing that you describe could happen without segwit, just by choosing an arbitrary block where the (suicide) majority attacker decides to split the chain with an invalid bit. They do not need a freshly invalid transaction type (made by the softfork) as an excuse.
In the end, this is not an issue in my view. It looks quite unlikely that an economic majority does not upgrade by the time when 95% of the miners have upgraded, so what would happen is that the 49% becomes the new 100%. After all, Bitcoin has gone through many successful softforks. Even then, the risks of this kind are worse in the case of a hardfork than for a softfork.

In that case it was not a 51% attack though (ghash was below 50% at that time) but a 0-conf double-spending attack.
That said, there have been successful 51% attacks, like the one against the "overflow" transaction that orphaned it, or the one that corrected the leveldb accidental fork. You have no guarantee that your confirmations will persist, especially if they do disruptive things.

It is not exactly 21M but 20999999.97690000 BTC. The reason behind this is that we have an initial block subsidy of 50 BTC and halving at four year intervals. After 32 halvings the subsidy is just 1 satoshi and after 33 halvings it is 0. This is what defines that figure.
10' blocks makes sense to ensure synchronization, and 210-kiloblock long halvings helps adoption (we are early adopters still today!). Finally, why the initial reward is 50 and not 100 or 10 is probably to make the final supply avoid approximation issues in double-precision format, as 5tu says.

No, Erik, no. Bitcoin is the most-cumulative-work **valid-block** chain stemming from genesis block.
Block validity needs to be enforced; Bitcoin does not work if not. Trivial example: Let us say that I hired over 51% of the hashing power and published a top valid-header block which in its contents all your bitcoins are transfered to me; according to your definition, this is OK, right? You would honor that as Bitcoin as it fits your definition, As you see, full-block validity, not only header validity, is necessary or incentives fall apart if not. It does not stop at *transaction validity* either; there are not rules more privileged than others. See this piece of research where they give concrete proofs:

Then they are doing the exact opposite of that. With anything other than 100% support, a split is guaranteed. In that case, they need to split the funds so that users can have access to both subcoins. If both have subcoins have *any* value, customers will want them, so they will be morally, probably legally, obligated to support both. This requires two things: Strong replay protection, and consistent predictable ticker naming.

Post-quantum signing can be done based on hashing algorithms (like in the Merkle signature scheme). With these, we will be able to safely sign Bitcoin transactions, as long as we avoid reusing the keys.
Post-quantum encryption is a rather different thing. There are some public key systems like NTRUEncrypt or, if not, the solutions consist in symmetric encryption with a quantum resistant Diffie-Hellman-like shared key: This can be done with the *Ring Learning With Errors* algorithm (RLWE) or from supersingular elliptic curve isogenies (SIDH).

These are not different things: Technology cannot provide infinite abundance, and hence block space is necessarily a scarce resource (and this scarcity cannot be solely limited by orphaning rates without inducing centralization to the best connected miners).
In consequence, technological improvements can -on certain occasions- allow a reduction of the minimum fee or equivalently an increase of the maximum size, whenever these would not stress the decentralization of the system.

No. The Laws of Electromagnetism have not changed. 
I challenged the assertion that "DC power is horrible for long range transmission". Voltage, not wave-shape, is the primary contributor to efficient long-range transmission of electricity; secondarily, at equal voltage, DC is more efficient than AC.
Now, historically, HVAC was easier to do than HVDC, so this is why it was used in the 19th century. This leads to my "the main issue is transformation, not long-range transmission" because, indeed, once transformed to HV, "DC power is much less horrible than AC for long-range transmission".

Most wallets will not let you insert a zero-valued output, or even more than one output. At least not from the main gui. You can still send a dust amount and get the change replay protected; it will be unclear, however, when will that cover the entire wallet - you would have to first send all to your own address to consolidate in one output, and then send the dust amount to the magic address to split.
Many people will get it wrong and lose money; this is almost guaranteed.

Bitcoin's core protocol disincentivizes cartel behavior by miners, but only in a rather weak way.
If segwit support (which offers tothemoonanbbeyond perspectives) gets stuck at 90% support without any sign of concession, I guess miners can coordinate enough to collectively orphan viabtc and proportionally eat its share of the cake, thus making the 90% the new 100%. After all, the 95% requirement is only a default setting to set a common enforcement blockheight in an automatic way; human operators can manually intervene differently with minimal effort (an extremely simple patch).

No. It is actually the other way around.
Private keys are 256-bit long in both cases, so plain bruteforcing will not be different (blindly searching in this 256-bit space), only that with the hashing there are the additional hashing steps.
More finely, to invert a 512-bit-long uncompressed public key, [you would need around 2^128 steps]( In contrast, to invert a 160-bit-long pubkey hash, you need 2^160 bruteforcing (plus the inversion, which is negligible: 2^128 is billions of times smaller than 2^160).

Yes, you have to validate the signatures, but this is something that every node does (not just the one building a block). The costs of processing are negligible for all practical purposes (easily done with regular legacy CPUs even with full blocks).
The cost of including a transaction is, essentially, the cost of propagating it inside a block that you have found to a majority of the rest of the hashing power.

The attacking block with invalid witness still needs valid work (which will be wasted, because the attack transaction is invalid; that block will be orphaned), so it is a very costly attack.
The Finney attack (unrelated to the 51% attack as your reply seems to imply) is very similar to what you described: An attack block is crafted and sent to the attacked party the instant where a fresh block that contains a double-spending appears. Both blocks are valid, but most typically the private one will get orphaned and the public one (with the double spending) will get accepted.
The payee running an unupgraded node can easily defend from the invalid-witness attack by observing that the inputs that pay her are non-standard and so requiring more confirmations. This cannot be done in the Finney attack as both transactions are standard, so that situation is riskier.
EDIT: I see a difference: In the Finney attack the attacker needs to own (or briefly borrow) the coins, while in the invalid-witness attack she can use other people's coins. This affects the severity of the attack, but not its likeliness. Consider also that nearly everyone requires more than one confirmation (typically 6) for large amounts, as a defense against those risks.

All things equal, inequality causes marginality, social stratification, unrest and violence. 
Also, for practically any utility function that you would consider*, inequality unconditionally decreases collective wealth, at constant cumulative wealth.
Therefore, any action to reduce inequality that does not decrease collective wealth (big if, in practice) has a net positive societal effect. 
I agree that inequality reduction does not have to be an end by itself (after all, perfect equality occurs when everyone has zero and that is probably the only equilibrium). But nor global wealth increase, especially if its increased inequality makes it worse.
You also mentioned "poverty" and claimed that it is decreasing. I do not find any satisfactory definition of poverty, but judging by its proxies (marginality increasing, violence increasing) it would seem that it is instead increasing.

That is clearly not what he said. In that circumstance, "distributing it would still end in more costs" not necessarily affects his willingness to distribute (in that case, at least).
Notice though that his willingness to distribute may be quite irrelevant, though, because he is personally bankrupt. Depending on how much money ended up in his hands in the end, he might not be able to give back anything even if he wanted.
So, if through civil rehabilitation we can get, let us say, 80% back of the 160k BTC, through suing him (e.g., for criminal responsibility in the hacked coins) we might get 30% or less.
Additionally, Karpeles is not the only shareholder. 12% is owned by Jed Mccaleb and his claim was bought by Brock Pierce. He paid for buying that claim, so he will not easily give up his share (and let us hope that helps to back the tethers!).

Bitcoin is not just the blockchain. Paying to addresses is not scalable, but payment channels that use the blockchain (e.g., the lightning network) can be made an integral part of Bitcoin itself. To users --once integrated in wallets-- the payment channel can be made as an abstraction in place of addresses (just like "from" addresses, or bitcoin, the unit, which are only UI abstractions too).

It is not strange that all these web wallet and api providers want bigger blocks. Their view of Bitcoin is a p2p network of servers in datacenters.

All those options have big risk of accidental loss. You need some redundancy. 
What about something like this: Make two copies of your seed and cut each in three portions, which will be stored in three different places. In place  you store words 1-8 and 17-24, in place  you store 1-16, and in place  you store 9-24. This way, you or your heirs can restore the seed by visiting any two of these three places. Any of them can burn down with no loss. And in case one gets compromised, 88 bits will most likely stay uncrackable for decades, so you would be safe.
Even better: Use multisig. With Electrum, it is quite easy.

What do you mean with " validate that addresses from the seed eventually equal those from the wallet"? It is the other way around: With the Bip39-diceware sheet, you directly validate that the dice rolls generated the seed. With your method, I just need to MITM your access to iancoleman.io and inject my seed; you would have no way no notice that it is not your provided entropy that is generating it.
Your method can be vulnerable in multiple other ways, like the USB, the Ubuntu image, BIOS malware, or a hardware keylogger.

It is very difficult to *replace* a transaction in the general case, because most nodes do not implement RBF (replace by fee) (even if this is against their economic incentives).
So, in the general case, your best option may be to take advantage of the CPFP (child pays for parent) mechanism. For this, you need to make a second transaction that spends at least one of the unconfirmed outputs of the first transaction, add enough fee for both transactions, and then hope they get confirmed together. Many nodes implement this mechanism. Electrum lets you manually select which outputs you want to spend.
Now this is obviously quite inefficient (you add a new transaction for each bumping). Fortunately, recent nodes also have opt-in RBF, which means that you can fully *replace* a transaction with the same inputs if it has been marked as replaceable in its nSequence. At least GreenAddress and the most recent version of Electrum let you do this in their UI.
I tried it in Electrum and it is extremely simple. Choose the "replaceable" checkbox when you make a transaction, and then click it while unconfirmed, say that you want to RBF and choose the new fee.

Softforks are mere proposals. You may want all the fresh advances (compactblocks, improved UTXO management, HD wallet, C++11, etc.) but dislike segwit? Run 0.13.0 and no softfork is forced on you (no need to patch anything). 0.13.1 is practically segwit only, so upgrading specifically indicates a clear support for it.
I think it makes sense.
@_date: 2016-10-14 06:16:42
This. If the computer is compromised, the attacker will just change every address displayed to one under her control. Your keepkey/trezor/nanoS would display the same address; you would still get robbed.
So, to be safe, you must always double-check with at least a second device and, at this point, it is a better option to just multisig with that one.
@_date: 2016-10-03 21:45:41
The way I see it, the main decentralization forces in Bitcoin are associated to geographically distributed hashing: limited cheap electricity (usually at remote spots, or during occasional oversupply periods) and, ultimately, the fact that heat dissipation is surfacic. Nearly all the effects due to propagation of information needed for consensus go in the opposite direction, i.e., tend to centralize.
It is basically in that sense that I see (stratum-based) pooled mining as a big risk. Though I concede that, as you suggest, if it is made impossible, people might just switch the offerer-accepter roles (as in cloud mining) or make private pooling with signed contracts, so the alternative may not necessarily be better.

Strictly speaking, yes. However, a key point is that segwit-chain blocks will be acceptable by everyone, but legacy-chain blocks will be acceptable only by legacy nodes. Therefore, it is entirely possible that most uninformed or "uninformed" miners call the bluff only to find that segwit subchain emerges and, while slightly less secure, it is more valuable. Rationally, they would then rush to the segwit chain; the last one to switch will lose the most money. 
So yes, this requires some transmission of information, but only locally. It would bring a lot of disruption, but no persistent split. 
A more likely scenario, however, is that of a lot of signaling and global coordination: We will have polls, carbonvotes and, most importantly, prediction markets, and then *rational and informed* miners will activate segwit without any persistent nor temporary split.

Reimplementing the algorithms from scratch and hoping to retain bit-exactness is certainly a huge goal. Any small bug (which is nearly guaranteed, sooner or later) could potentially fork you from the consensus. 
On the other hand, dev decentralization can help avoid central points of failure, like well hidden backdoors, forced *governance* drifting, or salami centralization. Ideally, once there are two competing implementations that manage to stay bit-exact and they get widely adopted, then hardforks become nearly impossible and softforks [have to follow precise rules]( and all of the exploratory modifications can be done safely as sidechains.

But the technology is mostly uninteresting for something that is not Bitcoin. It is bad technology, and its only good is, paraphrasing Szabo, that it sacrifices technical scalability to achieve "social scalability". 
Blockchain is not a chain, in fact. It is a "blocktree" of all valid blocks that stem from the genesis block. Only with something like Bitcoin there is a (relatively weak) incentive to always extend the tip, thus going from *tree* to *chain*.
All of the Bitcoin competitors are significantly more centralized than Bitcoin. But if a more centralized thing were to take over, then it would make sense that it uses another structure that is better and more scalable, like DAG or hashgraph, not a blockchain.

Yeah, *stricto sensu* segwit does not *increase* the blocksize limit: It removes it.
It gets replaced by a weight limit which, "effectively" will limit blocksizes to around ~2.1MB.

AFAICT, fair criticism is welcome here (e.g., blockchain scalability, incentive analysis/selfish mining, implications of alt implementations like knots or btcd, wallets and services that suck, even occasional we-are-being-too-circle-jerky memes).
What is severely moderated is off-topic discussion of altcoins and other-things-that-are-not-Bitcoin *today* (even if they could become Bitcoin in the future in the absence of contention, which is not the case *today*). 
Some people prefer this well-kept-garden approach and discuss here, while others dislike it and are fully free to discuss elsewhere (e.g., at that other sub). Personally, most of the time I find all those personal attacks there too tiring, and this is why I tend to contribute more here than there.

You do not "contribute to the reduction" of something like mining. You either hash blocks, at a cost, or you do nothing.
*Counterparty* uses Bitcoin's blockchain because it is secure, not the other way around. I.e., if BTC collapses, there is nothing left to secure XCP transactions and contracts, other than forming a centralized cartel of interested parties, with some mechanism to enforce hashing quotas. (And of course if we were to reach that point we would be better off with centralized systems like delegated-PoS or Ripple.)
The Nasdaq case is better because there is an already central interested party in securing the underlying chain. Despite of what I said in my previous comment, it has a big risk too: If Nasdaq is willing to mine BTC at a loss (because they also protect their anchorings) then this could induce mining centralization in Bitcoin, which is already quite critical.

Yes, that is correct. Copay seeds use the BIP39 standard, which Electrum and many others support; they are pretty much different "pairs of glasses" as you mention.
Notice, however, that the converse is not true: Even if Copay-generated seeds can be used in Electrum, Copay might not use Electrum-generated seeds, as they are not made by default BIP39 compatible.

A non-critical hardfork like that one will be typically planned over 1 year in advance. And then it would just be 2x increase.
We can have segwit now, then Schnorr and cut-through. See how far the LN can go. By then, we might prefer to HF to an exponential increase (a potential time bomb) or maybe an improved flexcap proposal.

Generally I would agree. While inelegant, a vanilla extension block could make sense if we needed a quick deployment of extra capacity for genuine, economically significant transactions. 
I do not think that we are close to that today (e.g., much inefficient use, compare [this]( to [this]( but the price is going to the Moon and this attracts more users and more use among current users. It is not implausible that we might need it soon (sooner than a safe hardfork would require).
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:50:23
Segwit is, exclusively, a new type of signature for Bitcoin transactions.
There should not be any opposition to deploying them, as long as there are users interested in using it. Nobody will be forced to use segwit; it is difficult to understand how opposition to it would not be instead about something else.
Somehow, the way Bitcoin works, disruption of deploying segwit is minimized if miners signal they readiness, so a mechanism for that was adopted (BIP9). But miners misunderstood that as something to do with "voting" and they started signaling hardfork proposals (as if those had anything to do with the hashrate), secret softforks like extblocks (as if those were safe) and pretty much anything. And they blocked segwit for political reasons and for leveraging some "compromise".
All that has led to the current situation of zero progress. UASF is about affirming that it is users who are in charge, and if miners refuse the mechanism that would have avoided some missed block rewards, then so be it.
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:49:20
Why should a miner set it? It reduces the acceptability of their blocks for no compensation.
Moreover, for recurrent miners (major pools), it signals willingness to SPV-mine, which means that the competition is more likely to SPV-mine too (but false flag it as that they validated). Even, in some edge cases (selfish mining) an attacking miner might attempt to derail their competition with a poisonous costly-to-validate invalid block if she knows that they will SPV mine on top of it.

You would not lose segwit-bitcoins but you could unintentionally lose legacy-bitcoins, e.g., stolen by a bcoin miner.
In the September split scenario, Jihan &amp; co would fake-signal BIP148 but not enforce segwit. A full node would detect the split and do not send a segwit transaction until after properly splitting the coins. A SPV node connected to a non-enforcing (fake signaling) server would not see the split, so you could send a segwit transaction and lose it (on the legacy branch). The worst case would be if then UASF-enforcers back off, e.g., because there is ~0 hashrate.

No. Bitcoin is a technology that puts an incredibly enormous overhead (blockchain mining, verification and storage) in staying trustless.
If you trust a central operator but still want crypto-signed transactions then you can have Ripple, which is less costly and more user friendly. Or if you trust the status quo so much and do not need this ledger verification overhead, then you have simple centralized databases like PayPal, OKPay, etc.
In other words, there is no point in Bitcoin if you do not believe in being able to *be your own bank*.

Benign case: Careless user does not properly split her coins; then makes a segwit transaction which gets replayed on the legacy chain. Normal legacy-chain miners would not mine non-standard transactions (segwit), but bcoin would, and steal with invalid witness.
Worse case: BIP48 forces a majority of miners to fake-signal segwit support (all the pools under the influence of Jihan). Segwit activates. Bcoin mines a segwit-stealing block and there is a split. Full nodes see it and can react. Electrum with header-BIP148 detection (and connected to a non-enforcing server; this was the context of my 1st reply on this thread) does not even see the split and can have segwit transactions stolen on the legacy chain.

Even if you do not transact often, it is quite easy to forget where are your coins. Wallets intend to keep your coins/keys organized, so mixing them or using them in non-standard ways can make you miss some out.
Just an example: you are upgrading your wallet (let us say from electrum 1. to electrum 2.) and you sweep your coins to the new one. You think that the old one is well swept, but you forget that you needed one of the keys for unlocking some p2sh. Result: Unless you find your old, legacy seed backup, you have lost coins.
Micromanaging your wallet is inadvisable unless you are really sure of what you are doing.
@_date: 2016-10-27 09:19:13
Yes, and that reveals a deep misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works. You never had any guarantees that your transaction would be included just because it is valid.

Under the random oracle model, essentially, yes. Every valid address corresponds on average to 2^96 private keys.
Now, if each of these address-mapping events is independent, the number of elliptic key points per a given address Poisson distributed, then we can expect that with very high probability none of the 2^160 addresses would have 0 matches.
@_date: 2016-10-20 09:29:23
I do not.
I suppose that, principally because that is what recent popular releases, like Bitcoin Core, do. Full RBF is not present but in less visible patches / personal branches. Also, I have tried to replace max-nSequence transactions and it did not work, while with "replaceable" ones it did, but I have not done a systematic observation of that.
@_date: 2015-10-13 14:59:30


In this case you also have an opportunity cost: Saying that you limit the block size per orphaning risk or because it reaches the hard limit, when you include your own fee-less transaction, often you could have included a fee-paying one in its place. I.e., there is an implicit "fee" that you pay to yourself.


If it has high priority (old inputs and large outputs), then most nodes will relay them and altruistic miners will end up picking them. But they have no *individual incentive* for doing it, other than nowadays fees are negligible compared to the block reward.
Another possibility is to make a fee-paying second transaction that depends on the first one. Then both get mined together in what is called *child pays for parent*.

Well, this is how works in nearly all of the cases where miners are rational. Yes, the UASF could theoretically split the chain and a majority hashrate go on with an altcoin, but as long as they care about their mining profits, they MASF before that happens.

A couple of observations:
- This happens at any scale. There is nothing particular with the current fee level (there are so many 1-sat or few-sat outputs), and *Bitcoin would eat itself* even at insignificantly low fees.
- Assuming that we have fee market now, and that many people transact (and so, price transactions) in dollar-equivalent terms, that situation will improve with the price increase. Fees in $ terms will stay the same, or even increase (so that users pay attention at optimizing them), but they will decrease in satoshis. This can unlock some of the present-day dust.

Look, me too I want to get this done. I think segwit is wonderful tech, and 2MB non-witness (maybe with a lower witness discount in the weighting) should be harmless enough. Also, doing a hardfork will prove that Bitcoin can indeed hardfork.
That said, this is not how Bitcoin works. nullc can do whatever s/he wants; this will not "get this done". It needs a **near unanimity** to upgrade: In fact, it means that we create an altcoin and then, if the original one dies, maybe we can still call it Bitcoin (but, properly, we definitely cannot if the old does not die).
In conclusion, I do not think that it can work. And even if it works, it will be a terrible sign that a dev team and closed-door meeting can centralizedly modify Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:31:54
Essentially, bcoin has code specifically for that: 
A full node would detect a split and would be able to carefully split the coins between the two chains; the legacy chain would at most steal from careless users, so it is not that bad. In case of a fake-signaling split, however, SPV node would not see it and think that there has been no split at all, send a segwit transaction, and get it stolen. The effect would be even more dramatic if UASF-chain supporters back off.
@_date: 2015-03-19 18:42:31
You could use Bitcoin core (which has multisig in console mode), in which you will have full privacy, especially if you route it through tor. If you want a nice multisig gui you can add electrum with a local electrum server.
A simpler, nicer alternative is to use  It can be private if you broadcast your transactions one by one, through tor, and shifting identity in between.

Keep in mind that Bitcoin is a decentralized network for p2p money and so it has a diverse, headless community. In Bitcoin, users are their own banks/payment processors.
The few "Bitcoin companies" out there are mostly small startups and even then most of the bigger ones are trying to monetize their own tokens (aka *scamcoins*) or sell their centralized off-chain rails for bitcoin-denominated IOUs.

There is sane hashrate other than Bitfury's, and you could say it differently: With Bitfury the hashrate will likely survive.
I agree, however, that if the UASF hashrate is ~0, users will just frustatedly switch back to the legacy chain.


But the two things are independent because one is a softfork and the other is a hardfork. It is entirely possible that we end up with Bitcoin and an uninteresting 2MB altcoin and both segwit-enabled.


Yes, but 2MB is obviously too little. Why not activate segwit first and observe how we adapt to the higher capacity?

The blockchain exists precisely because you cannot tell what was *first seen* in a trustless, decentralized way without it. In Bitcoin, **blocks are the time measure**.
If the p2p protocol were to be trusted to that point (always enforce first-seen), then we would not need mining or blocks, and we could decide close-in-time double spendings with something like Ripple-style consensus or even PoS-voted delegates.
We cannot expect miners to act economically irrationally (they may do it now because fees are irrelevant compared to the block subsidy, but I fear that this will not last). Block building will only work if it is [incentive compatible](

I still fail to see your point. Your start your article (the 1st one) by pointing at dev centralization and the political risks of a reference implementation (side note: I do not think that the BU insanity would ever care about DC; look at how they do not just ignore Core but also Segwit and the entire BIP process), and at its software integration costs.
Your proposed solution, however, makes only things worse in those aspects. Dev centralization would get worse if more centralized (less meritocratic or even single-company centralized) implementations make it to the critical set. I see also a big risk with the "fail if one fails" approach, which could confiscate coins because of a buggy but "critical" implementation. On the software integration aspect, users will have to support *all of them* instead of just a simple C++ library / daemon.
Furthermore, you assume that each implementation is consensus-compatible with itself, but this is almost certainly not true (in the absence of formal verification). Notice that the BIP50 bug would have happened even with only 0.7 blocks, as the db lock limit affected how nodes saw reorganizations. That is, consensus goes beyond individual-tx or individual-block validity considerations, but on the blockchain as a whole. Defensive Consensus would make those type of bugs even worse.

Key stretching is snake oil (in this context, at least). What do you think it changes? Instead of bruteforcing for one day on a single computer, it needs one month on a botnet; it does not fundamentally change anything nor suddenly makes your insecure brainwallet magically secure.
Also, an email is not a salt. A salt needs to be computer-generated and have entropy equivalent to that of your key. Your email is already in public lists of Bitcoin users.
ECDSA, the way it is used in Bitcoin, presupposes that your key has at least 128 bits of entropy. Less than that can still be safe, but not much less than that. WarpWallet just changes the factor, not the exponent, so in comparable terms you could say that your 40-bit warpwallet is as hard as a 50-bit old-style brainwallet, i.e., not much and definitely still vulnerable.

All proofs state hypotheses. In the *proof of publication* case they are minimal.

In that case, miners from the majority chain could coordinate (not necessarily collude) to attack the minority chain until they destroy its *economic* support.
Of course, this situation would greatly reduce the value of bitcoins, so we would never reach that point: instead, merchants, exchanges and the other economic actors would just follow the intentions that the majority had explicitly expressed.

But if sidechains are supposed to be used for exploring innovative features this is precisely what you want to avoid in the first place.
We would be either in a *subjectivity* voting case or in an effective soft-fork to the sidechain rules. This latter case is elegant as it provides a way to make hard-forking changes as soft-forks, but probably not for exploratory evolution.
@_date: 2015-11-25 11:00:50
Fundamentally you cannot really distinguish individually controlled miners from collectively controlled ones: Any entity can pose as smaller than it is.
There have been some proposals to disable the outsource-ability  of mining, e.g.,  but even then psztorc's argument would remain valid.
The only forces against mining centralization are the laws of heat dissipation and the fact that cheap electricity in a particular location is limited (i.e., natural/renewable sources are distributed, and engineering and safety limit fuel-based plants).

Segwit-transactions on the main block is the most important benefit. 
We can get extension blocks later, probably starting as a vanilla sidechain and softforking it to full security if there is enough interest.
@_date: 2015-11-03 12:50:00
I think that that policy makes sense: Splitting Bitcoin into incompatible forks dilutes the value for all of them (primarily from decreased network effects and increased risk and uncertainty about future value).
This is an intrinsic consequence of decentralization and limits Bitcoin's evolutionarity at its base layer. A successful future ecosystem may be composed of sidechains or child chains of the current chain (as the ultimate backer), along with non-chain agents like fidelity-bonded Chaumian banks.
Independently of this, is a centralized, moderated forum with rather transparent rules of what is on-topic here. Many people disagree with these, [but this is not a problem as long as they are free to discuss elsewhere.](

The grandparent was probably thinking in a 51% attack where a majority cartel would make a long-range Finney attack to unupgraded nodes (transactions with invalid witnesses). This could require only minimal coordination, if attackers have a way to provable fairly share the loot.
However, you do not really need a softfork for that. The collusion terms by a 51% could also agree that the attacking sub-chain will be abandoned later (even if it was fully valid). It is usually thought that 51% attacks can only censor, not steal, but the fact that they can long-range reorganize (e.g., while shorting BTC and using rented hashing power) makes them a major risk.
Notice also that Bitcoin Core will not "validate the full history" prior checkpoints, and that Bitcoin Classic will only do it for the previous 24h.
@_date: 2015-03-14 17:14:59
This is good because it implies that access to Mycelium servers is resistant to censorship. Also that Mycelium servers do not know my IP.
It is still far from ideally private in the sense that Mycelium knows which addresses go together (so demasking one reveals the whole wallet).

I am afraid that these two things necessarily go together. A regulated, censurable Bitcoin is essentially worthless because there are more efficient alternatives at this point. E.g., Ripple or Bitshares are more streamlined payment processors and avoid Bitcoin's overheads at the expense of trust centralization.
Personally, I am in Bitcoin because I want it to go to the Moon.
I do not consume illegal substances or products, nor use illegal services. My type of occupation does not offer room for hiding income and avoiding taxes; the same for my typical expenses. I do care about my financial privacy and sovereignty but then again the amount that I can comfortably invest in Bitcoin is too small to make a practical difference. 
However, I see clearly that Bitcoin can be a true financial liberator for many, as long as it strongly remains censorship resistant. Only this way will Bitcoin reach the Moon.

The unstable, non-dominant equilibrium that we have been observing until now is that miners collaborate. But it is an iterated game, so it takes just one defector to force everyone to that pool-destroying Nash equilibrium.
Anonymous pooled mining is definitely over. I really hope that this does not increase too much the centralization toward hosted mining.

@_date: 2017-05-28 17:10:11
No, please, do not. SPV works because miners can censor your payments and fake transactions to you, but not steal from you. If you trust headers for segwit, but not do at least some casual assurance that the server is validating segwit, you could lose money. BIP148 opponents (e.g. bcoin) have already said that they will "steal" segwit outputs on the legacy chain.
Now, a split is extremely unlikely, because it is the worst possible outcome, but there is no hard assurance. We could have an August split, based on header signaling manageable by SPV, or a September split, based on witness validity which would be a real mess.
Ultimately, UASF is about enforcing a new rule and this implies that you should *validate* the rule in order to *enforce* it, i.e., you need a full node.

You are right; we cannot avoid accidental consensus failures. However, the BIP50 disaster happened because some increased the stress as we were in the middle of an upgrade (from bdb to leveldb): There were roughly half of the miners on 0.7 and half on 0.8.
We could have raised the soft limit a couple of months later, and then we would have gone on with a single chain. Old nodes (most of them, non-mining ones) would have got stuck in the presence of big-block reorganizations, but the result would have been much less traumatic.

False. It will activate with *any* strictly positive miner support (realistically, it will not be practical with 1%, but it could be workable with as little as 15-20%)
Also, miners do not really need to upgrade as long as they use a segwit border node and are careful enough about who they spy-mine.

Segwit is a new, optional type of signature. I do not see how it could coerce anyone. After BIP148 successfully activates, legacy nodes will work just fine (segwit-capable nodes will use segwit; pre-segwit nodes will not use it, so they are unaffected, but they will still indirectly benefit from the reduced tx-inclusion pressure).
You could only argue that miners will be somewhat "coerced" to validate segwit blocks, but this is how Bitcoin works: A 51% cartel can always impose secret softforks.

Yes, you can skip the spam, but then you are not fully validating. Then a majority of miners could change the states at that time. It would only take two pools and a handful of *actually validating* nodes to corrupt the blockchain history.

The hardfork will probably increase, not decrease, the typical max blocksize from 1.9MB to 2.0MB. In the unlikely case that we all moved to signature-heavy transactions, then yes, it could reduce the max blocksizes from 2.1MB to 2.0MB. Only in the theoretical maximums (for exotic transactions that nobody uses) it would reduce from 3.7MB to 2.0MB.
Luke's proposal is very nice: Its detractors have had to finally concede that *segwit is indeed a blocksize increase* in order to criticize it!
Notice also that by limiting to 2MB, that would ease the 2,4,8 path (or other further increases) without the risk of having 4,8,16 poison blocks.

You could simply define what makes a valid commit, just like you define what makes a valid block.
You do not consider invalid blocks for the longest chain rule. Similarly, you would not merge invalid commits.
Blockchains are good for deciding a set of transactions and a particular order. Once you externalize these through permission, they become unnecessary and tree-like structures are more efficient instead.

No. But these are not relevant to *proof of publication*. I do not need Byzantine consensus, ECDSA or even to hash-digest my publication.
The only assumptions are that:
 1. A majority of the hashing power (reweighted with vulnerabilities known only to the atacker, if you want) stay honest.
 2. Propagation times are much faster than block times.
With these, it is **guaranteed** that the blockchain**s** will contain some honest blocks (and my desired proof of publication with these) and all reorganizations attempting to exclude it will be of exponentially decaying probability.

Let this prove you wrong: 
Nakamoto's conjecture has been proved. Under the assumption that propagation periods tend to 0, the lack of a majority attacker **guarantees** that honest players will be able to publish blocks. In other words, *proof of publication*, the *backbone* of the Bitcoin protocol, is pretty much proved, and this is all you need for secure, decentralized timestamping. This is what the parent commenter wanted.
Now, the broader conjecture, namely, Byzantine-fault robustness in the absence of a majority attacker is not proved. In particular, Bitcoin's *probabilistic* Byzantine consensus does not have *strong validity* in general: it only has it most of the time in the absence of 1/3 attackers.

You can run again a node from your laptop. The blockchain syncs fast with headers-first and you can prune most of it once you have downloaded and validated the blocks, so it no longer takes many GB. It uses much less CPU also.
The rest is more or less the same: Price is up, difficulty is up, and you will pay a bit more as tx fees (though still pennies).

@_date: 2017-05-12 11:07:27
I agree, but I think that we are discussing different things. In its mature state, LN will most probably have positive fees for unbalancing and negative fees for rebalancing channels. In that case, most transactions will probably see effectively zero fee and then, yes, BU would need an *infinite* block size in order to offer the same.
However, my reply to the great-grandparent was about somehting simpler:




And I mentioned Ripple as an example. It has a 3TB blockchain and only 2 nodes that matter (both operated by Ripple Labs). Their minimal fee is around 0.1 satoshis and so their maximum blocksize is finite (theoretically, around 50 exabytes if the entire supply got sent in the same block; fees get burned).
Of course Ripple is optimized for that setting and BU would not be able to achieve the same with its current technology, but I can imagine that a 100MB BU chain (organized around a single pool or a handful of pools that spy-mine each other) would be able to sustain 1-satoshi fees. Notice also that the system does not get spammed to death thanks to active cat-and-mouse blocking of IP addresses and payment addresses (in Ripple, addresses are reused all the time and they need to maintain a base reserve of ~10$).

Also, about the case where the buggy critical implementation makes some coins unspendable, yes, you are right that they could be recovered by removing the implementation from the critical set.

 - Firstbits are orthogonal to vanity addresses. In particular, generating a vanity address does not grant firstbits registration, and the *firstbits* are usually different from the *vanity* part. Assuming relationships in these is risky.
 - Firstbits get registered only after you have sent to the address and the transaction has confirmed. 
 - It is generally a bad idea to pay to an address that you do not know well (only parts of it). Addresses have checksums for a reason.

Asking about altcoins here and there is a **good** idea. The asker should digest the information and reach her own conclusions anyway.
Personally, I like altcoins and I think they make excellent testnets. They are not *scams* as long as we keep in mind that they are worthless.
While it is true that *we are zealots*, because of our stakeholding, there is a general argument against altcoins: Since there is no limit in them, they eventually lead to an infinite supply for the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem if more than one is acceptable. Infinite supply ultimately makes the tokens worthless.
As a consequence, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has a stable attractor at a single finite-supply coin. Once that point is reached (and it was in 2009) the incentive for everyone is to stay at it (the exception being, of course, the preminers and other conmen).

Well, obviously I paid no attention to the status of the PR; this is incorrection, not necessarily dishonesty. It does not really change my point: Miners mine non-standard transactions all the time with Core-based software.




I did explain how; it's okay to say you don't understand my explanation.
If BIP148 is a success, then yes segwit will activate and there will be no problem. All the game-theoretic incentives go towards this scenario. However, a premise of the hypothetical situation that I was describing is that there would be irrational behavior. 
Since I mention "the legacy chain", I presume that BIP148 would have not been a success and that there would be a non-segwit sub-chain with a hashrate higher than a segwit sub-chain (or no segwit sub-chain at all).
So, in that hypothetical, unlikely case where there is indeed a split and a sub-chain activates segwit but the other does not, the legacy chain would be able to replay and steal segwit outputs (even if they are non-standard for them, they would be valid for them) from the segwit chain.

Tax rates become effectively regressive at some not-that-high point. E.g., the richest 10% have 80% of the income but only pay 70% of the personal taxes, in the US at least.

A healthy fee market would never have that huge fee heterogeneity. Right now, transactions with a 240-260 sat/B fee get next-block confirmed, yet nearly half thousand transactions offer over twice that amount. Last weekend, transactions with 80 sat/B got confirmed but there still was at times over one thousand of them (per interblock period) paying 200+.
This is not consistent with the headlines that fees are "painfully" too high. Most transactors systematically overpay even when there is no need for that. What we urgently need is not Segwit, it is better RBF support in wallets. Most of them use dynamic fee estimators that get easily gamed; to the best of my knowledge, only the last version of Electrum has a nice RBF interface.

If we had a cartel, with mechanisms to punish defectors then, yes, they could set a *minimum acceptable* price.
However, in reality, many miners are anonymous and so there cannot exist cartels or punishment mechanisms. The consequence is that (excluding propagation costs) every miner has the *individual incentive* to accept anything strictly higher than zero.
Also, as a side note, I am pretty much certain that Apple sells its devices at a price that is very close to the one that maximizes their profits, i.e., the production cost is not much relevant in this case (at least as long as they are able to keep selling the brand as an added value and to patent-troll their competition).

I do not think that this is the case. Fee heterogeneity is huge: Most people simply do not care and systematically overpay.

In Bitcoin, you send funds *to* addresses. Transactions are made such that you spend previous unspent outputs and this allows the creation of new outputs. So, in the general case, there is no meaningful *from* address concept.  . That said, the *previous destination* (*previous destinations*, for tx with multiple inputs) may be defined in most cases.
If you know the exact amount, and it is unique, you can try to find the exit transaction through a block explorer api.
Anyway, they will probably not reset your pin just mentioning an address; they will likely ask for a signature with the private key associated to it. Maybe grams support are able to help you.

@_date: 2017-05-07 21:00:49
No, it will not. People say that there is a risk of centralization just as a precaution for something that we do not know for sure, because it still does not exist. That said, I have not seen any compelling argumentation of why the channel topology would be centralized. Notice that:
 1. Channel topology would mimic frequent payments, because there is where it is most efficient (technically, there is a preferential attachment on payment frequency). The current payment topology (for Bitcoin or in general too) is small-world and with a continuous spectrum of degree scales (that is, no hubs). Therefore, the most likely LN topology would also be hubless scale free.
 2. Even if, for some reason, a hub emerges (e.g. establishing channels is not made simple in the early channels but then a big web service appears that promises to do it with just one click), there is little risk. The hub would not be able to steal. If it stops processing, it would be very easily replaced (the system is permissionless), and if it just charges high fees, it would be circumvented (establishing circumventing channels is simple). Even if they appear, hubs are inestable.
 3. Even if hubs appear and there is some friction from establishing the aforementioned circumventions, so that we end up with some degree of centralization, the situation would still be much better than if we centralized the base layer. This applies to other 2nd layers too, and indeed before we have a fully developed LN it could make sense to deploy somehting like Teechan, if there is enough urgency for that.

XRP use is not more than for the fees, and so it can work by having any strictly positive value.
The "bridge" use case of IOU1 - XRP - IOU2 that they advertise is completely absurd. Not enough market makers will ever provide enough liquidity against such an unstable asset. Less when the Ripple system permits direct IOU1 - IOU2 links and complex paths. 
In other words, XRP cannot reliably work as a bridge currency and Ripple is indeed more robust with multiple bridge currencies (hopefully more liquid and stable than XRP).

As I said, in BIP50 it was the reorganization itself that triggered invalidity. Some v0.7 nodes saw the longer chain as invalid while others (those that did not see the shorter not-really-orphaned chain first) saw it as valid.
In that case, Defensive Consensus does not change anything. The other implementations would not have had the same bug, sure, but still half of the DCS3 nodes would have followed the shorter chain (if they had seen it first, because of Core) and the other half would have followed the longer chain (again, because Core would have seen it as OK).

However, bitcoins are fungible and they where held all together in a same wallet system (even together with Gox's own BTC denominated profits). And then, even if it would have been possible to determine whose deposits got stolen and whose did not, it would not seem much fair to pay back fully 24% of the  depositors and zero to the rest, and there is no simple solution when you take into account people that net sold BTC and withdrew the fiat, nor people that sold through BitcoinBuilder.

That would create an altcoin and it would be much much more rushed and unpredictable than BIP148. Since nobody is forced to use the segwit format, I do not see the point of forcing oneself to a segwit-hostile chain.

I am afraid that you might have lost the north, Eric. The problem with your opinions is that your business (on-chain trading) requires big blocks. You externalize --free ride, actually-- the validation costs on full node operators. And look, this is fine; the system is permissionless, after all. But please stop complaining if the fee costs make it more difficult. I will not increase my node costs or, more importantly, weaken the censorship resistance of the system, just so that you can make more money.

This does not exist, because fees in Bitcoin transactions are just an abstraction. Transactions specify as inputs a set of valid conditions/signatures for unspent outputs and then specify a set of transaction outputs. The difference of satoshis between the outputs and the inputs is what we call the fee.
Therefore, the replacement transaction will necessarily have different inputs or outputs or inputs and outputs.
There is no simple solution. There is the *first seen safe* mechanism, which adds a new input and a new output and preserves the previous ones, and there is also the *child pays for parent* mechanism which spends one of the outputs in a subsequent transaction with a higher fee (so both can be mined together), but all of these increase the complexity.

I do not think so. *Individual incentives* are the only ones that matter in a permissionless peer to peer system.
If miners are censorship resistant (and so, necessarily, anonymous) then *collective* incentives that are not aligned with the *individual* ones have no effect. This is because there is no way to ban -or even discourage- free riders.
The system appears, to some degree, to be avoiding selfish mining and enforcing 0-confirmations. But this is only out of altruism (it has a non-zero cost), and so it is not guaranteed to last.

Non-urgent fees are still ~4c, urgent at ~90c; these are not expensive for high-value trade. Microtransactions need to go offchain, yes, but this keeps the network decentralized and robust.
So, in my view, it is the other way around: A bloated blockchain would certainly kill BTC utility as a currency.
I would love to see smaller fees and bigger blocks (like segwit, then something like extblocks), but not if my full node costs become prohibitive. If I had to trust someone else for validating payments, I would use instead something more streamlined like Ripple (as much as it is a centralized, premined shitcoin).
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:22:26
I agree. Notice though that the most effective attack blocks would still probably be those hard-to-validate better than those hard-to-propagate.

Nodes were rejecting blocks smaller than 1MB, but at the same time the mining code was not creating blocks strictly larger than 1MB. This is how their blockchain halted.
No, this is not "working as intended". You are not supposed to get stuck for two days in a minimally adversarial network. The situation was resolved only when someone manually changed the mining code to make it craft a block that respected that "stupid" minimum size limit.
What would have happened on the mainnet? Devs would have reacted in a few hours, probably, instead of two days. Still, miners would have been rejecting their own blocks and burning money for all that long. The 20-25% minority chain would have made some progress, probably attracting scared miners. Segwit2x will survive because of the wipeout protection, but probably in an uninteresting shape and with little hashrate. 
So, yes, pretty much a fiasco. If I were mining, I would certainly use 2xWithoutBadParts or maybe just Core.

Consequently, any alt-chain that does not preserve the value (via one-way or two-way pegging) will fail.

Unfortunately, it is far from sane. Emergency forks are appropriate in case of severe bugs (e.g., BIP50) but not for new functionality like segwit or a weigh-limit increase.
BTC1 devs are incompetent. They thought that segwit was two limits. They have nearly zero experience in consensus-critical code. Their alpha release failed to increase anything. Their beta release got stuck (it would stupidly force a big block but it would not create it!). Their BIP91 softfork would have been a catastrophic failure if Matt had not saved their ass in the last second (he severely exposed the FIBRE network to vulnerabilities by doing so).

What you describe is a *collective* incentive, not an *individual* one.
Every miner wants to go to the moon. However, if some action has zero individual reward and non-zero individual cost, she would *rationally* wait for the next miner to do it.

Many mainstream economists dismissed Bitcoin because "anonymous founders can create coins at will". We defend that this is false, but this needs that we keep enforcing the rules.
We have been enforcing the original set of rules [since the beginning]( (and, additionally, we have added more restrictive versions of these; there is no way to know what rules our peers follow, just if they violate a certain set).
Things like *the original vision* or *the social contract* are nearly impossible to accurately define, and they mean different things to different people. While it may look reasonable to say that the genesis block rule is *more fundamental than* the size limit, it is unclear that one is fundamental and the other is not, or both are, or both are not.
Having a distributed, universal, shared view of the world requires that there is only one set of rules. It is not a *let market decide* situation: E.g., let us suppose that I buy post-fork Core coins at a Core-supporting exchange, and later it is XT that ends up taking over, Bitcoin has failed for me as a store of value.
I do not know what is a *consensus hardfork*. But it seems to imply something like that we collectively agree to let the current Bitcoin die and then found a new Bitcoin that preserves the state of the moment but follows different rules. If not everyone agrees and the original subnetwork lingers, then there is a value dilution, and many of these kill Bitcoin for good.
Consequently, my preference for evolving Bitcoin is through extension blocks or sidechains. I know that this implies rewriting most of the current software, but at this height of the debate I think nobody defends that the scalability solution is simple.
@_date: 2016-05-11 18:58:32
Privacy is hard and transaction tracking is quite possible in Bitcoin in many cases. 
You would need to user Bitcoin Core over tor to check for payments made to you, and JoinMarket for sending the transactions.

No, there is no "distorted hand" with segwit. From 








coins passed through a script that depends on the softforked rules.


which are perfectly legal today in the blockchain. So, if this is a worry, we can solve it by marking incoming transactions as "uncertain history" in the wallet if they have an anyonecanspend transaction with less than 6 confirmations in its history. In fact, the same problem to a lesser extent exists if coins pass through a 1-of-N multisig or so, because you're not only trusting the (indirect) senders, but also their potential cosigners.

No, it is not. A full block will not be orphaned, typically. 
That is not standard: It is called spy-mining and it means that a few seconds (definitely not a minute) after a block is announced, other miners mine on top of the header as they process the rest of the block.
It is a pretty dangerous practice indeed, and of course it does not make sense that Bixin spy-mines itself. Yet apparently that is precisely what they are doing.

It is clear at this point that segwit will activate. Some miners still have not upgraded (including a couple of fools still signaling Classic). Their nodes are already displaying an alarm that upgrade is required, but they will need some time to do it! 10 days (UASF) is better than 1 day (BIP91, if it activates).
The big risk now is that BIP91 locks in tomorrow, even before Segwit2x's release. Wang Chun is making that less likely.

That said, and as much as a split is improbable, every bitcoiner should run both a BIP148 node and a legacy node, just in case. This way we will be able to split the outputs and dump our (uninteresting, centralized) Jihan-coins or Barry-coins.

It is difficult to anticipate what would happen. If the collapse is fast enough, there might not be time to prepare enough for the change. If it is severe enough, availability of electricity will be probably put to other, more vital uses. If the blockchain halts, there might not be enough global coordination to restart it later.
In a different scenario of a more or less severe degrowth -but not really a collapse- then yes, we would see [hyperbitcoinization]( happen first. At that point, Bitcoin could probably adapt to a later collapse of the entire Internet but to few dedicated RF links, or maybe a basic mesh network. If there is not enough electricity (or, more probably, if electric availability becomes too inhomogeneous so that we can no longer assume that one single actor has 51%), we could move to a fedpeg sidechain with varied representativity: Today, these would be prone to regulatory capture, but in a scenario of crumbling states, this risk will be greatly reduced.

It takes 2016 blocks; almost certainly longer than 1 week (it is close to 2 weeks on average at full hashrate).
I said 1 block per day just to minimize any possible ambiguity. I presume that the segwit chain will switch to a different POW algorithm if its hashrate is too low (even if such an event would be against any rational expectation). So, said in other words, I will sell my segwit-incapable coins and buy segwit-capable coins as long as there are blockchains where I can reasonably do so.
I will only *not* do that if:
- There is no schism (99.9% probable outcome)
- Segwit-enabled chain goes on in minority but with less than 1 block per day (on average) and no POW change
Notice that nonsegwit chain cannot go on in minority, and if it hardforks to implement wipeout protection it will almost certainly do a POW change or at least a difficulty adjustment in the same event.

Some years ago, the Bitcoin Foundation was principally the sole organization in charge of Bitcoin development. It proposed the adoption of blacklists and some core devs defended the proposal. I will not say that Bitcoin was close to lose its censorship resistance then (opposition by users was colossal), but that possibility seemed much more likely then than it is now.
Btc1 are proposing that we go back to that model: Get rid of the current loosely defined development group with decision based on rough consensus (Core) and change it with one that has formal membership and is much more hierarchical. 
Some people tend to imagine that it would take government agents confiscating full nodes and ASICs, but no: Self-censorship via dev centralization is the easiest way in which we could lose Bitcoin's censorhip resistance.
This is mainly why running a node must remain affordable. Users need to be able to take back control if development gets compromised. As an example of what happens when users do not validate the rules, have a look at Ripple: They forced arbitrary freezability of funds retroactively (issuers can selective scam and confiscate, even for assets that were previously fungible) against 99% of user opposition. There was a fork, yes, Stellar, but it is equally centralized and thus equally capturable.

The transaction would have to be replayed first, and even if it gets replayed, it is non-standard, so nodes in the legacy chain will not propagate it and miners will not mine it by default.
If the UASF chain is in minority, splitting the outputs is the first thing that we will do (mainly to dump the legacy-coins). Users who fail to do so will lose money no matter what (assuming that legacy-coins are valuable) on the other chain; actually it will be mostly non-segwit transactions those that will be replied, as mining nonstandard-from-legacy-perspective segwit transactions in a block will require explicit collusion. 
In fact, if you can wait four weeks after the split, segwit transactions will probably be a very effective way of splitting the outputs.

Still, it is a rather risky setup: You must keep the 10 private keys safe, at least until you spend them. Have a look at BIP39, which avoids address reuse naturally and in a more forgiving way (the seed keeps generating addresses indefinitely as needed).

Not in the same way.

It quite depends on the risk model. Alone, no, there is no incentive to reject it *a priori*. However, in a race against a later seen block (which is claimed as validated), competitors might prefer to drop the SPV-marked one and mine on top of that later one.


Of course. Bitcoin works only if miners maximize their profit. Also, there is a perverse incentive with pooled mining. Solo miners might prefer to stop wasting electricity while they validate, but pools are expected to keep sending work and accepting shares at any time.


This is why I specify a costly-to-validate invalid block (let us say, multiple minutes). A miner above 34% has no incentive in being cooperative.
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:12:40
yet few wallets use it.
See my comment; with "we need RBF" I mean "we need a wider deployment of RBF functionality in wallets with an easy, accessible interface". Only the most recent Electrum has this. Secondarily, we need it for CPFP too, for cases where it is payees that want to bump the fee. 
As for miners, it would be nice if they move to support RBF too (less than half of them currently do), also deploy full-RBF (opt-in-RFB is not incentive compatible and nearly nobody accepts 0conf/nobody should).

Look at the state of things right now: 
The vast majority of "segwit2x support" is very obviously not running segwit2x (signaling versionbit 4 but not 1). As soon as next week, segwit2x will orphan those blocks and get stuck again (this time on the mainnet).
BIP91 (and later BIP148 and later BIP141) will activate Segwit, by means of modded Core, not Segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:43:40
Yes. I mean that if the vast majority of the economic significant nodes run vanilla Core, miners could play games and drop BIP91; they might even be incentivized to do exactly that 
Additionally, even if BIP91 stays enforced, a Core miner will build on top of an invalid non-signaling block (and thus waste work), and a Core node will accept any spurious confirmations added by invalid non-signaling blocks. These two issues are greatly aggravated by the presence of SPV/spy-mining.

AFAIK, Greg and many others are not fundamentally opposed to a hardfork as long as it has very wide consensus. This is understandable: A hardfork without nearly unanimous agreement will split the network and severely decimate its value.
No proposal yet has achieved that. There seems to be little opposition to BIP103, but arguably it is too slow to make a significant difference. At first, it looked like Flexcap could have enough support, but it has rather surprisingly seen little progress so far (though I can see the problems of adding an additional incentive).
After seeing the effects of the moderately bigger capacity offered by Segwit, it is rather clear for me that a further hardfork will be on the table.

It looks like nobody in the NYA working group understands Segwit. 
They agreed to "Segwit as deployed" and "change 1MB limit for 2MB non-witness size limit"; they did not realize that that second constraint is superfluous and does nothing. They also saw that as a hardfork (it is a softfork).
While they did not discuss details, practically the only way of achieving what they "agreed" was Luke's proposal of hardforking to give the witness discount to non-Segwit transactions too. Instead, they moved the goalposts to 8MB size limit (instead of 2).

No, not the "effective block size", the **real one**. Witness data is transmitted inside a block whenever a block gets transmitted, within the same structure as previously. Blocks get *actually* larger, typically 2 to 2.5MB in the optimal case, and up to 4MB in the worst case.

Well, I think I see your point, and you are right that this could be a problem in cases where jackpot &gt;&gt; block-reward or, more concretely, if E(withholding-advantage) &gt; block-reward.
A a sidenote on hashrate: for this attack, this should be owned (not pooled) hashrate. We know that miners easily discard dishonest pools, and this is why the *selfish mining* attack has never been executed despite several pools owned over 33%.
But it is true that what I described would put an upper bound to the jackpot. A possible solution is having parallel lotteries (in this case, the alphabetical order that I proposed is vulnerable, but this is avoided by changing the order to something like SHA(pubkey-hash||block-hash)).
But then there is actually a simpler solution that limits nothing: let m be the `jackpot /  block-reward + 1` integer multiplier, then we set the winner using the hashed concatenation of the m consecutive block hashes after the lottery closes.

However, nowadays most bitcoin transactions are *thought* in terms of their fiat exchange equivalent (e.g., *I send X USD in bitcoin to you*) and the last price is often taken as a **reference** (with or without weighting and/or other fancy things).
As long as the exchange markets have relatively thin orderbooks (compared to what is being transacted), big orders will alter this *price of reference*. Because of this, big players that are sending/receiving money can significantly move the exchange rate towards what is more favorable to them, and use for this only a small share of the quantity that they are paying/being paid. Additionally, they can coordinate their actions (collude?) to get a stronger effect.
In my eyes, you could call this **manipulation**. But as long as all trades are free and voluntary, I see no moral problem with that.

That is an undeniable empirically evident fact. What economists try to understand is *how* can this value emerge.
Daniel Krawisz explains that it is because of a **shared** hallucination that such value materializes. That is, it is primarily a social process; technology is secondary.

An important corollary is that [the technical obstacles (it is hard to use properly, it does not scale, etc.) are unimportant]( and another one is that altcoins are irrelevant.

- Create a &lt;1MB block and claim ~15 *actual* bitcoins, backed by the vast majority of long-time users. No split. Fools running BTC1 nodes get stuck and get shutdown; all of those "captains of industry" would almost certainly already be running Core nodes in parallel just in case.

That is a very restrictive definition and, I would add, probably shared only by a minority. For many people, if I give an opendime to you (and you verify its state with your full node) would agree that I have paid you in bitcoins. In the end, bitcoins are just an abstraction from messages/contracts on the blockchain (and some people prefer other units, like *tonal bitcoins*).
LN is absolutely trustless. Bitcoins sent on-chain to addresses (UTXOs) are not less "locked". Proving that you have the private key that unlocks an UTXO is not enough: The network needs to mine it first.
This is why I think it is useful to consider LN as an integral part of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:12:56


There is no such thing in Bitcoin. Miners can activate (through signaling) and enforce soft-forks, but not hard-forks. Maybe you are thinking of Counterparty or Proofchains, where block-validity consensus is not required?
As it is today, the likely outcome of 2x (which does not even have a BIP yet) will be a split. But for that you do not need any signaling at all. The pre-fork hashrate is mostly irrelevant; miners will follow the most relatively profitable chain, not the other way around.

Adding 0.8 to the consensus-critical set would not have changed anything. I insist: Gavin's post-mortem is wrong: It was at first believed that it was a 0.7 vs. 0.8 split, but it would have happened also with 0.7 alone.
What happened (simplified):
- 40% 0.7 nodes saw the shorter chain first (and they did not orphan it because reorganizing to the longer chain triggered invalidity).
- 60% 0.7 nodes did not see it first; they just extended the longer chain.
What would have happened with a {0.7, 0.8} consensus-critical set:
- 40% of the nodes would have seen the shorter chain first. 0.7 would have failed to reorganize to the longer chain, so nodes would have kept on extending the shorter chain.
- 60% of the nodes would have see the longer chain first: 0.7 and 0.8 in agreement, extending it.
That is, exactly the same split with the same consequences.

So let us say that it is infeasible in all practical circumstances.
Seriously, if a miner searches to create a block that is valid as per the current difficulty AND so that it also selects a desired winner among N, it would need to discard every N-1 valid blocks on average (or, in equivalent terms, multiply the "effective difficulty for them" by N). This scenario is only feasible if said miner owns a large majority of the hashrate (actually 51%, because this is equivalent to 100%), but the blockchain has already lost its sense then.

There is no such thing as "signaling for segwit2x". The miner-to-user (and by, extension, miner-to-miner) signaling is exclusively part of the softfork activation mechanism. 
We have seen BIP91 signaling; nothing else. Actually, after the proven incompetence of the btc1 team (in essence, there is zero serious review), miners are most likely running the minimal BIP91 patchset only - see: 
Also, mining is ephemeral: Miners can signal what they are doing not what they will do (this is independent of how much bullshit they stuff in the coinbases - they are equivalent and have less sense than Luke-jr's prayers there). In case of a hardfork, the hashrate will follow the market or get outcompeted.

I did not mention anything about my preferences, nor about the societal desirability of taxation (and personally: I have been paid by the state for the last 15 years; taxation is clearly beneficial to me).
Technically, taxes are indistinguishable from extortion (in the same way that *conscription* is *slavery*). This is how they get collected; there is no voluntary process, no contractual agreement. 
Now, is this the only way that they could work? Maybe. Are they morally justifiable if they end up increasing everyone's *liberty* (number of things available to do)? Probably. After all, the state is, in most cases, subject to the rule of law and sometimes to some sort of democratic process too. But I was not judging anything of that; I just mentioned that *taxes* get collected by *extortion*, and so the taxation of ransom payments would imply the taxation of taxes themselves (excluding some specific waiver, which is the case in practice: most of the state activity is itself taxed but *tax collection* specifically is not).

But after that, it is **hard to conclude anything else**. In particular, it is nearly impossible to know if the coins that entered are still at Gox (and the private keys are lost) or if they exited at some point in a way not registered in the database (i.e., hack).
There have been some attempts at further tracking, since we suspect that Gox wallet functioned in a quite automatic way, and [at least part of the code got leaked too]( but no success so far.

SegWit2x is poorly coded; it is being developed without peer review. This is why their hardfork test last week failed to hardfork and instead it stayed stuck for two days.
After that fiasco, most miners will not trust Segwit2x (btc1/NYA working group), but they still want to avoid the BIP148 forkening. Unfortunately it is too late to use the BIP141 (segwit activation as deployed in Core) so they are instead running this: 
 which is BIP91 (superfast segwit activation) alone.
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:50:33


Some nitpicking: CLAMs indeed distributed to every holder since launch. They set a dust threshold and gave equal shares to the rest of the outputs, for the BTC, LTC and DOGE blockchains. 
Bitcore-BTX is quite different: They have fully premined it and they promise to distribute it through a website/faucet, upon providing a valid signature with the BTC-holding keys, presumably for a limited period. In that sense, they are closer to Byteball or Stellar Lumens, which also distribute only to bitcoin holders that bother to enroll in their respective "claim" processes.
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:27:20
The value of the individual outputs is irrelevant; the attacker can make many payments to multiple merchants and double-spend all of them at once. Or she can pool up with other double-spenders: This is what Bitundo does.
Zero-confirmations was acceptable when everyone was running unmodified Bitcoin Core. However, that situation is not rational (game theoretically) so we should not rely on that. Incidentally, in Peter Todd's famous double-spending against Reddit, he profited from a discrepancy between Core and XT when relaying transactions. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 09:24:39
Probably that: 
The hardfork has always been quite unclear, but it looked like Segwit would at least activate via BIP91. After that, miners are probably too scared to go on. Even if 79% stay committed, BIP91 will fail and segwit will only activate through the much messier BIP148.
I think that the probability of a split is still very low in that case, but it is somewhat higher than with the BIP91 defense. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:41:14
No, it is not clear at all what bit4 means at this point. For the vast majority of miners, the versionbits are being set manually. They are setting bit4 but not bit1, which means that Segwit2x nodes will soon orphan those blocks. Miners are either:
 - Fully stupid and will orphan their own blocks next week
 - Running Core with fake versionbits
For most, it is obviously the latter. The result is that Segwit will activate on the legacy chain, and so there will not be any need for bip91- or bip148 minority chains. 
Past that point, it is unclear what bit4 means: We will probably have a Segwit2xII release with the BIP91 part removed, but miner signaling is little relevant for hardforks, and it is unclear how many people will still trust them right after a fake-signaling fiasco.
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:21:49
Yes. By Metcalfe's Law and Jensen's Inequality, it is guaranteed that the post-fork value of 1BTC+1BCC will be smaller than the value of 1BTC pre-fork.

I am not Roger Ver, so I can only speculate. The mining pool is obviously not his main business; he is willing to run risky software (BU, BTC1) because the status quo / Core roadmap is not beneficial to his other businesses.
Importantly: If Bitcoin fails but Ripple, Ethereum or Dash succeeds, then he wins too. So this is probably why he wants "adoption first" at any cost, even if it ends up breaking decentralization. 
High adoption in a very centralized setting would certainly benefit his *online casino* business and his *cloud-mining-ponzi* business. Additionally, high node costs would benefit his *API provider* business.
It is possible too that he is very good at VC investing but very bad at evaluating the technical soundness of proposals.
@_date: 2017-07-08 16:15:37


Please. XT and Classic do not have any upgrade mechanism. BU has one, but it is broken and does not guarantee convergence in all cases (even if all nodes were BU which is clearly not the case). BU and Classic forked each other (fortunately on the testnet, but it would have happened on live too) because they did not implement BIP109 correctly. Bitcoin.com pool, mining with BU, attempted to solve many invalid blocks before actually finding one (and discovering that the network rejected it).
Sorry, no, none of these could be any meaningfully called *well researched* nor *successful*. And all that talking only about the bigger blocks aspect; I am not even considering the many issues with XThin (BU nodes got shot, multiple times) or FlexTrans.
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:41:48

If there is a non-segwit block, they will build on top of it. Canoe and ConnectBTC are still not doing it, and KnC are still shamelessly on Classic.

Nodes can relay as they want. Miners will rationally prioritize by feerate and only by feerate (and those failing to do so will get outcompeted).
*Redlists* was how Mike Hearn was calling them. They were input blacklists and were mostly crime-related not spam-related (indeed, most *altcoiners* do not seem to care much about spam yet look quite obsessed about other people's money). To be honest, the proposal was to deprioritize them not invalidate them, but the Foundation was pushing for an enforcement as wide as possible. Invalidating would have looked like the next natural step, or in a scenario were all the few miners' big-block nodes would anyway be enforcing them, it would not even be necessary.

What I mean is that the minority chain, as long as it keeps moving, will not stay in a minority for a long time. The UASF chain will be accepted by everyone, while the non-UASF chain will only be accepted by less-than-everyone. Because of that, the non-UASF chain will get erased in case of healing. Mining there would be foolish. 
Even if foolishness settles and two subchains keep moving, the non-UASF chain will permanently stay at risk (unless it hardforks and so creates an altcoin). Other than that, UASF enforcers will value more the UASF chain and reject the other, while the UASF-neutral will equally prefer one or the other (UASF-hostile does not really exist; it is the miners, but they are selling not buying). OTC tradings just after the fork will then value UASF-chain coins higher. All this will happen before retargeting, even before coinbase maturity.
Finally, if any of these was not enough, the non-UASF chain is nearly guaranteed to steal funds from segwit users (because of bcoin). I think that most of the UASF-neutral folk see that a stealing chain is little valuable, so they will move to back the UASF.

BIP91 was not part of the NYA and it was added only as an afterthought so that miners could save face against the UASF.
The NYA said 2 things:
- Activate Segwit as deployed in Core.
- Limit the non-witness part of blocks to 2MB.
Segwit2x is still not released and BIP91 is being re-specified as we speak. The most recent proposal is to delay the orphaning until August 1st, even if it locks in before.

Avoid paper wallets. They are malicious even when they work as intended. Now that BIP32 based options are widespread, they are totally unnecessary.
Address reuse has both security and privacy issues. Browser and printers should never be used for any significant amount of coins. If you need a paper wallet, generate it with BIP39 or Electrum (or similar) and write down the seed on a paper. This is it.

Please define "hyper-popular" and "much larger". I more or less tend to agree with the sentiment of your comment, but without specifics it is hard to say.
It all depends on the channel topology. Notice that the real worst case scenario is the one where the vast majority of users have just one channel with a semi-trusted party, similar to today's bank account. In that case, 1MB blocks could probably serve the entire World and, while there would be little privacy, the situation would still be much better than today: Non-inflationary currency and no real options for bail-ins (even if a poor user cannot afford a channel close, fraud would be provable and evident so richer users would desert the bank if they attempted to do it, thus preventing it from happening in the first place).
Anyway, that is why I meant with "non-disastrous"; it is obvious that bigger blocks in a worldwide adoption scenario would significantly improve robustness and privacy, and reduce friction. At least on a sidechain.

Why do you ignore the first part of my quote?


When we consider propagation costs, then this might make a minimally acceptable fee. However, the problem with this is that the expected reward is no longer proportional to the hashing power, and so it favors the better connected miners, which often are also the biggest, i.e., it is a centralization force (the laws of heat dissipation favor decentralization; the laws of network communication favor centralization).
Even then, the minimally acceptable fee will be the marginal cost of propagation, but miners would need an *additional* income to pay for the hashing power. This may easily end in a state where either no mining is profitable, or it is only profitable for a few big non-anonymous (and so censurable) miners mining on the very backbone of the internet.

*Instantaneous* respect to the decaminute scale: In this context, it means that `propagation_time &lt;&lt; 10' `. If propagation takes any significant time (in this timescale), then the previous miner has a head-start advantage and Bitcoin is no longer incentive compatible.
Even a few seconds can be significant enough. Notice that mining intervals are exponentially distributed and this implies that, while their average is 10', over half of them are shorter than 7' (10' Ln(2)), 1/4 of them shorter than 3' (10' Ln(0.75)), 10% shorter than 1', and so on.
The article is wrong in one aspect though: Propagation can be made pretty much size-independent via pre-consensus mechanisms.

It is not that easy.
Your typical transaction has one or more inputs and two outputs. Let us consider that you avoid paying in round amounts, and that you have unspent outputs that are of the order of your payment. In this case,
no one except the payee can know which is the payment and which is the change. The result is that the tracking information gets diluted by half at each step.
That said, this situation is still far from ideal, and this is why stealth addresses and coinjoin/coinshuffle are still needed.

All of them are largely centralized and require a lot of trust. 
Coinapult, Bitreserve and Tether are just centrally issued IOUs. Tether and BitReserve are fully KYC services just like banks (and so not different from Coinbase USD walllets). Coinapult Locks are anonymous, but not less centralized (see in contrast colored coins or Ripple IOUs, that are also gateway-centralized but at least can be freely traded as IOUs without the onerous locking/unlocking).
Nubits is something that [can work in a fairy world]( There is only currency issuance and no destruction (only temporal parking). Since USD is also inflationary, this is not necessarily a problem, but the incentives are really complex, experimental, and not guaranteed to work. After all, issuance is decided through voting, which is done on the PeerShares blockchain: one that has nothing at stake.
BitUSD is probably the least centralized case. It contains programmatic margin calls in their internal decentralized exchange as a stability mechanism. This might make the system work as long as the market capitalization of Bitshares exceeds that of its assets. Main problems I see: the stability mechanism requires external price feeds from centralized exchanges (which are known to get hacked or "hacked" all the time) also, more importantly, the fact that the blockchain has nothing at stake: in this case it is not even the usual "proof of stake" but one by *delegation*: attacking agents just need to have earned the delegation votes and do not need any stake at all. In practice, the delegation votes are fixed by the developers, but this is just another type of centralization.

If BIP91 activates the day after tomorrow, it is highly probable that many miners will still mine on top of non-bit-1 blocks. When fake signaling is so prevalent (notice that some are signaling BU on top of BIP91!) the safe bet -or Schelling point- is the status quo, which is what Wang Chun is doing.

No. That is just Craig's narrative to justify his stupidity.


I don't. It is just that keeping anonymity while being only one is hard enough, imagine if shared between three. Also, it seems rather counter-productive. If 3 people had come into agreement to build something like Bitcoin, posting as 3 separate anonymous entities would have given a better image as an interesting project, not just a one-man pipe dream. 
Keep in mind that Bitcoin launched in January 2009, and it was not until December that the *very first* difficulty adjustment took place; this should give you an idea of how hard/uncertain must have been those early days.

Frankly, with Craig exposed as a fraud, it makes people associated with him less likely to be related to Satoshi (than any other random person). It is a bit sad to see how some bcashers seem to be trying to craft complex theories about how Craig could still have somehow fitted with the creation of Bitcoin, just to rationalize all the time they have been duped, in bed with him promoting Bcash.

The 2x part is a distasteful, bad joke. The agreement was supposed for "Segwit as already deployed" + "2MB limit for the nonwitness part". They ignored that the latter does nothing in the presence of the former and misunderstood that somehow segwit had two limits (it only has one: the weight limit; the size limit is FAPP removed), so they went on to modify the former instead. In other words, they moved the goalposts - they are continuously doing it indeed. This is why nearly all devs [are opposed to 2x and some even LOL at it](

That is not correct. A block has always been the same thing, before or after segwit: a header followed by a set of transactions.
Transactions themselves can be structured in different ways. Classically, signatures were not separable, but now they are (as they do not affect the id). The fact that they are segregable does not mean that they are outside of the block at all. They are still an integral part of the block and they are transmitted along with the transaction when a transaction is transmitted and they are transmitted inside a block when a block is transmitted.

Well, excuse me if I was too much emphatic in the grandparent comment. I am tired of all the FUD against Segwit in which it is portrayed as "not a real increase", when in fact it is.
With Segwit, we can have 2-2.5MB blocks full of real, actual, regular, on-chain transactions. [Up to 9000 per block]( not "as if there were" but actually there.
You were obviously right (and I upvoted you for that) in that Segwit will probably bring induced demand by itself. But this is orthogonal to OP's point, which is that Segwit here is just the enabler for the LN (which unlike size increases, will scale without induced demand).
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:59:35

Your coins are in your Trezor in any case, with one frontend or the other. You cannot really "transfer your coins to the BIP148 wallet".
So after August 1st, with 99% probability everything will go on and we will have segwit (pre-locked-in at least). There is a very small probability of a split, in which case your bitcoins will split in two types: legacy-btc and bip148-btc. In that case, you would control the former with the legacy wallet and the latter with the BIP148 wallet.

This comment shows how people lose money. No, it is not clear at all and, in fact, it is unlikely that it is still around by then. Principally, it was a transaction crafted to promote a BU hardfork; its author will most probably invalidate it before a miner of a competing fork (BTC1) gets the reward.
And even then, it would not be enough: Rational miners would try to orphan a block with just this transaction and claim it for themselves (since its reward is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the block subsidy).

The secure solution is much easier: If OTP-2FA is present, do not accept SMS-2FA. Actually, they are already doing that for email confirmations.

No, the incentive that, at least theoretically, cartel behavior is unenforceable because defecting pays off (1 make believe that they have 51%, 2 defect so that they fall below, 3 eat their part of the cake) and it is not punishable.
Also, in a situation where a miner can keep adding hashrate at will, while all the others stay constant, the optimal strategy is to stop at 49% because past that it is mostly competing with herself when difficulty adjusts.
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:31:29
Let me see. In scientific literature of stochastic processes (and also, more generally, dynamical systems and others), t=0 is used to indicate the present time, i.e., the time at which you are making the assumptions, specifying the conditions and basing the predictions. This is basically the only reason for defining a 0.
Yes, it would be *technically correct* to say that at any time t, the honest miner will be expected to find a block at t+15, but using different relative time origins in a same problem (especially, when there is no need for that) is not only confusing but somewhat misleading.
Notice also that they cannot be both right: From Craig's assumption, selfish mining is not profitable. From Peter's, it is. There are real consequences.
Craig's explanation seems to assume that mining has some sort of cumulative progress, which is plain absurd. The previous Chief Charlatn of Bitcoin got bamboozled by that conman; the new one is a bit smarter. So, without any intention of setting a precedent, and for one time only, hat tip to him.

No, no, that was changed. The grace period was deemed too long (!) and so it was first reduced to 0, and only recently expanded to 48 blocks (~8 hours) 
But I doubt that all miners are running that recent code, so God knows what will happen.

Segwit removes the size limit and puts a weight limit in its place (actual size limits vary; 4MB worst case and 2-2.5MB best case).
If you further limit to 2MB, that is a softfork, not a hardfork. Garzik looks (rather worryingly) confused with that. Indeed, their alpha "blocksize increase" failed to increase anything. Later, they doubled the weight limit to 8MB, which is something that did not appear at all in the "agreement".
This is why we are jokingly calling it *Segwit8x*.


But unless it is by a majority cartel, soft-limiting is not rational.

I mean that CLAMs are much different from Bitcore-BTX, and probably closer to BCC. You could argue that CLAMs are bitcoins (and litecoins and dogecoins) with a nonlinear-but-monotonic transformation on them. But any 1:1 correspondence is artificial (e.g., you can use tonal, Lightning Network uses millisatoshis, you can use multiples on sidechains, etc.), so BCC is hardly special in this front (btw, BTX has 1:1 correspondence too). 
Also, you could think of Counterparty XCP as some sort of one-time one-way pegged sidechain. If miners soft-forked to enforce XCP validity rules, and only those, XCP would become the new BTC (of course, such thing is unimaginable in practice).
BCC is similar to BTC in that it also has the same hashing algorithm (not the same proof of work, as the difficulty adjustment rule will be violated). It might become the altcoin that is the *closest similar* to Bitcoin after testnet-coins. But because of this, it will also probably the most uninteresting altcoin too. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:43:19
It is probably not as bad. The non-BIP91 branch will be at wipeout risk so it will be quickly deserted as soon as the BIP91 branch retains any significant hashrate behind.

I am afraid that you might have spent too much time in the other sub. No, that is fully incorrect: Segwit is not an *effective* increase but a real one. In removes the blocksize limit (and puts a weight limit in its place). Neither witness nor non-witness parts are counted against block size as it is no longer limited, but both are counted against block weight. And that witness part, even when segregated, is an integral part of the transaction/the block i.e., it gets transmitted inside the transaction whenever you transmit a transaction and it gets transmitted inside the block whenever you transmit a block, just like today.

Thus "nonlinear-but-monotonic" transform. I guess that the value distribution was more unequal than the number-of-outputs distribution.

The lock-in and activation of BIP91 has indeed occurred. But that of Segwit2x? I do not think so. Most signaling was fake anyway: I mean, it happened before BTC1's actual release, with many inconsistencies like BU signaling on top of it, with things like bit4 but not bit1, without witness commitment on the coinbases; in other words, it was done with customized Core nodes, not BTC1 nodes.
The way things have occurred, the 2x part (which has been redefined from 2MB to 8MB after the agreement) should not happen.

Even more than that. I would say that BIP34/BIP66 provide a mechanism for evolutionary consensus that is friendly with *developer decentralization*: a majority of miners are permitted to reject the rule change and stay indefinitely with the older version (or a fork of it, or an alternative implementation that does not follow the change).

Well, are there phase transitions?
I expressly consider a T-S (and not P-V) cycle not just as a preference for an analogy, but because then the temperature analogue --the cost of electric joule produced-- indeed behaves as a temperature and fits the three principles. Furthermore, if cost is defined also in energy terms, i.e., as an EROEI, I avoid having to assume any single-price theory.
The same for entropy: Mining stochasticity is intrinsic. Mining is rent-free and permissionless, so miners do not get richer (in other words, mining entrepreneurship comes from aspects external to Bitcoin, like management of infrastructure and operation, but there is no intrinsic "unfairly getting richer" as part of the Bitcoin system). This is why I describe *electricity-to-bitcoins* as a conservation of entropy. 
The weakest point in this proposition is the equilibrium assumption, which I think is far from granted in practice. But this is OK: There are no Carnot cycles in the real world, which always operate at sub-optimal efficiency. Secondarily, but also important, is the fact that the joule-cost sources are far from ideal sources and often have a very limited capacity. "Cheap electricity" spots are scarce, but I do not think this limits very much the model, because Bitcoin uses, and will probably always use, a very limited amount of energy compared to other moneys.


The interdisciplinary community known as "Econophysics" could certainly find an interest in Bitcoin. This would be an interesting complement that is rather orthogonal, in perspective, to the more usual approaches to Bitcoin as a cryptosystem, as a distributed computing system or as an economic system.

In the second scenario, if you think that it is OK that miners waste resources and nodes accept fake confirmations, then yes, it will "fix itself". Yet, as I said, you avoid the risk by running UASF, which is thus safer than unpatched Core.
The first scenario is less probable but much more disruptive. Core nodes accept equally bit1 signaling or non-signaling blocks. If all of the economically significant nodes are Core, for miners it is a priori indifferent to extend a signaling or a non-signaling chain. In a fully adversarial setting consisting of only anonymous or fakely identified mining, the rational behavior is to extend non-signaling blocks. Indeed, the rational behavior is to extend any blocks that respect the validity rules from the perspective of the economic nodes (this is also why soft size-limits and honor-respecting 0-confirmations are not incentive compatible).
Now, the reality is that pools try to build some sort of reputation with anticipatable behaviors and running codebases that are not incentive compatible. This means that BIP91 might stay enforced just on chivalry. But I do not know. Do you really want to risk --however small it might be-- that Jihan starts bitching something like "NYA has been broken" and then all his proxy pools (&gt;51%) stop signaling for segwit activation? He has such an opportunity only if people run vanilla Core instead of UASF.

Fully agreed.
I started that after I get mad at several posts back then that where doing bullshit analysis like "you follow the coins that go from there to there, then they go there, and finally arrive there" that prove nothing. I wanted to do a more serious analysis, and it succeeded in the sense that we [identified]( most of the entry and exit addresses.
But after that, it is **hard to conclude anything else**. In particular, it is nearly impossible to know if the coins that entered are still at Gox (and the private keys are lost) or if they exited at some point in a way not registered in the database (i.e., hack).
There have been some attempts at further tracking, since we suspect that Gox wallet functioned in a quite automatic way, and [at least part of the code got leaked too]( but no success so far.
What looks clear is that Gox's cold wallet was a multi-address airgapped computer (unlike, e.g., Stamp's single-address wallet, which is probably a paper one). But this is something that already confirmed in his chats years ago.

If I understand it correctly, the hardfork bit is the old sign bit, which is set at HF time then reset immediately after. This is guaranteed to fork, because old nodes would see it as negative nVersion thus reject it (and being forward-compatible, BIP9 respects those previously used bits).

10-day window: Yes, rather short time, but definitely not *daily*.
Look at longer time scales: Bitcoin is descending to 1.5% *per diem* volatility. This is comparable to some fiat currencies. This is really impressive, even more when you consider that Bitcoin lacks a *reference market* and as consequence it is intrinsically more volatile (even with sustained short-term arbitrage margins).
This is why **occasionally** over short time windows, even major currencies can have a volatility peak above that level.

He does not say it specifically, but I think that he also implies not transmitting the full block (and instead using solutions like the proposed inverse bloom filters). 
However, most importantly, Satoshi made Bitcoin evolutionary. So if bitcoiners find that a fancier solution (e.g., treechains) will scale better / be more secure / be more decentralized, we will move towards it.

IIRC, keys used in p2pk coinbases are not exportable (one would need to hexdump the wallet and extract the key from there). Also, please notice also that "export private key" is a misnomer, as the *wallet import format* refers not only to the ecdsa privkey but also to the specific type of outscript that it will look for: uncompressed, compressed, segwit, etc. There are not a thousand combinations, sure, but wallets only look for one specific format; they do not check all the combinations (that would be unnecessary overhead most of the time).
So, to sum up my point, coins sent to 1A1zP1... *could* be certainly spendable with some non-standard manipulations, but the way Bitcoin Core works, they would likely go unnoticed by its intended recipient.

You do not count the subsidy, as this is something deterministic hardcoded in the system, **not actual debasement**: My valuations for btc are based on the whole 21M.
With larger block sizes (segwit) and, mainly, with lightning networks, the velocity of bitcoins will greatly increase. Therefore, even with the current unit value (and thus current security) the transaction cost will become orders of magnitude lower than today.

Yes, that is a major concern.
In the main chain, a 50% attack can block your transactions or even revert them after they were shallowly confirmed, but cannot rob you. The attack would be very visible and get extinguished soon (in case it is done by a pool).
However, in a two-way sidechain, a rogue 50% can rob you and essentially kill the chain, as you describe.

I do not think that it is a reference to non-thermal energy only.
It is probably a reference to the non-conservation in an open, expansionary universe, as they also say "Do not use in universes approaching heat death".
Therefore, using the device increases thermalization, spreads massive particles, and so irons a little our local metric. This pushes away a bit of the universe beyond our cosmological event horizon, and thus it can be said that it "decreases the total energy".

Stiglitz is a well respected, Nobel laureate, brilliant economist and a really smart mind. What he says is quite the *best* Bitcoin critics can bring against it. And, as you can see, it is not much.
Essentially, he concedes that Bitcoin is rock solid and economically sound, to the mighty point that it scares the powers that be (which have already stopped laughing at it some time ago). Think about it: if he truly believed that it does not have the attributes of a good currency, he would not be asking for a ban, as it would not be necessary.
However, it is now quite obviously too late for a ban. A ban could have killed an early Bitcoin, but that ship sailed long long ago. I am afraid Stiglitz grossly underestimates how big the "monster" has become already.

For both transactions and arbitrary messages, what is signed is a fixed-length hash of them.
Bitcoinocracy is automatized; they do not accept arbitrary user-crafted messages but instead tell the user what to sign (well, in fact, users can propose new statements, but most are just signing previously existing ones). This is how they could make it collide with a transaction.

Let us give a measure to the current state of Bitcoin adoption and use `M_b(t)`.
This measure is unstable. In a far future (but still one that matters to you, e.g., in 20 years), this measure would be either much more larger (success scenario) or much more smaller (failure scenario) than today.
Now, let us assume as an hypothesis that the cryptocurrency that ultimately succeeds is not Bitcoin (H). Let us say that there is a currently existing altcoin such that today it is less used than bitcoin, `M_a(today) &lt; M_b(today)` but in the far future it will be more adopted i.e., `M_a(far) &gt; M_b(far)`. Because of the "instability" argument exposed above, this actually implies that `M_a(far) &gt;&gt; M_b(far)`.
This does not necessarily imply that *there can be only one*, as future coins could appear. But in any case it means that `M_b` would be at the *failure scenario*.
However, if Bitcoin has failed against an altcoin, this implies that this particular altcoin can fail against any newer competitor. If Bitcoin fails as a practical store of value, no altcoin would be seen as a safe store of value. This necessarily implies that both `M_a` and `M_b`in the far future would be smaller than today. But this point is in contradiction with our hypothesis H: 'altcoin succeeds' =&gt; 'altcoin does not succeed'. *Reductio ad absurdum* makes us discard H.
There can be more than one (and there always be), but if cryptocurrency succeeds then Bitcoin will always be the one of choice for any practical purposes. This is because it has been conceived as an evolutionary protocol. Whenever a significantly advantageous feature would be tested and validated on an alt, it would be then implemented in Bitcoin. The blockchain itself could be eventually mutated (through proof-of-burn or as a sidechain) to something completely different, while preserving all the value representations (i.e., with bitcoin staying bitcoin).

Ah, no of course, I mean *rational* as in game theory. Essentially, in Bitcoin, cartel attacks by a coordinated majority cannot happen (unless there is a way to punish defectors) when all of the members are individually below 49% of the hashrate share. 
A consequence of this is that softforks are not incentive compatible, in general. You can solve this in two ways:
- Very high (over 95%) required for activation, so that the lack of incentive gets negligible.
- Economic majority forces the hand (UASF), which can lead to a very messy activation, with non-persistent but relatively long-lived splits.

Also, Satoshi is believed to have mined most of the early coins. Now, try to imagine the case if reward was gradually dropping since after launch. In the best case, there would have been an enormous pressure to relaunch. In the worst, the system would have probably never taken off.

No, not necessarily. 
You can use Metcalfe's Law as a proxy for sub-network's worth. And then consider the worst case scenario: Losers leave the system.
Then you compare that with the expected gain from the hardfork, and you get an indication of how much "contention" you can tolerate for the schism.

Looking at my wallet history: Most of my recurring "payments" are done to (centralized) exchanges. This could be an interesting use case: A moonbeam to a trustless exchange, where funds get deposited only at trade time (and then a back-moonbeam for sells and canceled orders).
That said, Bitsquare is superior, because it decentralizes both the BTC and the fiat part. Maybe, for high-frequency speculation, Moonbeam could be useful coupled with  or other semi-trustless option market.

But this was the case since launch. The vast majority of ether was premined by the founders (they sold a part to early investors, before launch, and kept another ~12% for selling later).
Notice how, in contrast, Satoshi launched Bitcoin with no premine at all. Not only this, but until 4 years later the reward was still 50 btc per block.

Resistance? For how long? A few years, at best, maybe less than a decade. Fundamentally, it cannot turn something insecure into something secure in a significant degree.
When you slow down a process by a factor of 1000, it just implies that the cracking will require a botnet and last one week, instead of a single computer for one day.
WarpWallet is painful to use on a powerful computer and nearly impractical on a phone.

There is an issue with all of your examples in that you are using an uncompressed pubkey. I do not think there are any valid reasons for that these days and you should probably use instead its compressed counterpart.
As you mention, addmultisigaddress lets you choose the signature type, and it defaults to p2sh-segwit. However, segwit is not compatible with uncompressed pubkeys. Because of this, legacy address is forced. You can see that both scripts are legacy, not segwit. (this tool can help:  )
Now, the script hash in the first case is the one corresponding with 3GiimyxF1R5VixfBFAbQZbuy9EesD2r6n1. I ignore why you get 36ULucjWUTrDvaJzCyhFoVbDoNS6Zum2Du with the first command, but it does not correspond to the script that follows. It may be a bug.

There has never been a hardfork.
Blocks that exploit bugs to create hyperinflation have been (and will be, in the future) rationally abandoned by miners and left out of the valid longest chain.
So the response to that event was actually the system working as intended. Some time afterwards, there was a release that disabled the possibility of exploiting the overflow bug again; this was a softfork. There was no rollback or anything close, and the two events (the abandoned block incident and the softfork) were not related in any way other than the fact that they refer to different aspects of the same bug (exploiting it and being it possible).

It is not about semantics, but about the mechanics of how wallets work. The output in the genesis block is a p2pk script and the recipient's wallet is designed to recognize only these type of scripts. 
Blockchaininfo has a bug where it displays some "address" for that, which I think corresponds to the p2pkh with uncompressed key; Satoshi's wallet will not recognize these UTXOs as its own. If expressly made aware about those first, Satoshi could theoretically make some custom code to sign a raw transaction that spends them, but frankly that is far beyond the point; from what we know, Satoshi does not use blockchaininfo or reddit.
@_date: 2016-07-26 17:30:48
Sorry "extra bits" is a vague term. What I mean is that if, for a giving brute-force attack, what is considered a *safe* key needs 75 bits at least, then key stretching may get you to be safe with a e.g., 65-bit password input. Which is a bit shorter but on the same order.
Of course you can get more aggressive with the key stretching, but then you soon end up with a scheme that cannot run on low-powered embedded devices (which is not desirable). Keep in mind that, in the worst case, they would be typically running in an interpreted script on top of some sort of virtual machine, so 10 bits (2^10 time factor) is already a rather generous estimate.

Economic majority support is only needed for minority activation. For majority activation (hashrate share &gt; 51%), the only thing that matters is a small economic support. For segwit, it definitely has been there.
Since last November, Jihan has had the possibility of enabling larger blocksizes. The vast majority of wallets and services are already segwit-capable; they would be using it and we would have 2-2.1MB blocks right now. 
It is rather clear -for me at least- that Jihan does not want larger blocks.

Unfortunately, that was not incentive compatible. The same happens with trusting the first-seen version of a transaction.

My $2000 workstation (8xi7 32GB RAM) cannot do an IBD. I tried it for four weeks and it got stuck. A reasonable IBD should not take more than one week, otherwise most people would just instead trust, not verify.
I do not know what was my progress when I gave up (per blockheight it was around ~40% but per validation work could probably have been much less). Also, a $20000 machine is nearly always less than 10x as powerful as a $2000 machine.

This encourages verification laziness.
With signed binaries: `gpg BINARY.asc` OK!
With signed hashes file:
 - `gpg SHA256SUMS.asc &gt; file.1`
 - `sha256sum BINARY(ies) &gt; file.2`
 - `diff file.1 file.2`
Though many may just do the first two steps and then **very dangerously** manually compare the hashes (i.e., just the first and last couple of chars). I confess having done that at least more than twice.

What I said is that it creates a false sense of security. Technically, it **is** a bit safer, though probably much less significant than what you imply.
Practically, it *might* be less safe because, though we agree that  identify =/= verify, temptation is strong to actually make it be the case.
It happens with non-vanity addresses also: There are attackers in the wild (rather targeted, OK) that exploit the fact that most people only "verify" the first and the last characters of addresses (the small screen in the trezor does not help here). It is a guess, for the attacker, where to stop cracking a similar address in her control. With a vanity, though, you are telling her exactly when to stop.

I think you are right, but for a different reason.
Most of that transaction volume is back-and-forth speculation, which is price neutral by itself (except for exchange fees, which get sold at market rate to fund their operation costs).
The rest is dumb selling (dollar valued, by the so called "payment processors"), dumb buying (again dollar valued, e.g., *I buy x% of my pay in bitcoins every month*) and, finally, fresh minings (btc valued). The first two, being fixed-in-fiat amounts, have little capacity of moving the price and self-adjust quickly. The other one, miner selling, is a nearly deterministic quantity, perfectly transparent, which can be anticipated by all investors.
Therefore, the smart money investing, which is the lion share of all buying, has good experts on board and is very aware of that point. They know that a halving was coming since forever, and they have already done any time-arbitrage possible. There is no reason the halving should affect the price at all.
Now, of course, maybe if we make enough noise about it, we could attract more people (we are all still early adopters) and we can start a new speculation wave with price going up, even astronomically. It would have nothing to do with the halving itself though.

It is a bit riskier to sign arbitrary messages than canonical transactions.
In particular, notice that transactions are authored by the sender, but messages are crafted by bitcoinocracy. Hash functions are usually much stronger against pre-image attacks than against collisions (even at the brute-forcing level, because of the birthday paradox). SHA2 got designed because there were known collisions against MD5 and SHA1, and SHA3 got designed because, while there are still no known practical collisions against SHA2, it is theoretically thought to be vulnerable.
This way, Bitcoinocracy could trick the keyholder to sign a message that collides with a transaction that spends the funds on an address under they control.
**This is theoretical only, and in practice probably safe, but do not forget that we would be talking about a 30-million-dollar reward.**
@_date: 2016-07-20 20:53:33
I am not sure what you mean. The message being signed is always a hash (SHA512 by default) of the binary or the text file.
I describe the case of gpg user, which I think is the vast majority of users. 
And if the binaries are directly signed, why would you still need the SHA256SUMS.asc ? To check for accidental corruption, without verifying signatures?

But as far as I understand, treechains would be probably best implemented as a sidechain, and that is the only point in common.
First, they want to solve different problems: treechains are mainly a solution for scalability; sidechains are a more generic way to allow innovative rules, but keeping backed by the main chain. Treechains are also conceptually simpler (thus most probably safer) as they are based on *proof of publication* and avoid the difficulties of a two-way pegging.

Seriously: There are some exchanges that appear to offer the option of exchanging bitcoins for *moneroj*. Bitsquare is a software that can do it in a decentralized way (peer to peer) without trusting any third party. Then there are also centralized services; I cannot really recommend any of them, as they have scammed people in the past and they almost surely will continue to do so, but I have heard that Poloniex might be minimally reputable (again, I cannot recommend them in any way).
Ultimately, understand also that Monero is seen by many as nothing more than a test blockchain, and so their tokens are not necessarily valuable. Any innovations in it that prove innovative will be ported to Bitcoin at little cost and profit from its stronger security and network effect (e.g., the Confidential Transactions proposal for Bitcoin is more private and has much better scalability).

Well, you vote with a signature. You spend also with a signature.
Whenever you sign from the cold wallet, there is a risk that the private key leaks (e.g., accidental nonce reuse is the best known example, but it could also leak through side channels, opportunistic key loggers, etc.).
Ideally, each time you sign with a private key that gatekeeps large amounts, you should discard it as *probably compromised* and send to a fresh *cold* address. Even revealing the public key is a risk for amounts of that size.

It is still an open question. In principle, transaction fees should substitute the fresh issuance as a reward. But it is unclear how fees could reach a sustainable level in that case. 
The issue is rather simple to see: If there is no subsidy (or if it is much less than the fees), after a block gets released there is no incentive for building the next one, until new transactions arrive. So actually other miners would mine competing blocks while they can.
One solution to this is that there is a permanent, assured, backlog of high-fee transactions waiting to get included, but this does not look much sustainable. Some alternatives have been proposed, like fee pooling (unfortunately gameable), hashing assurance contracts (i.e., charity) or even demurrage (equivalent to permanent inflation). Meni Rosenfeld even suggested we will need to abandon pure proof-of-work by an hybrid substitute like proof-of-activity.
It is a bit scary as we may already be approaching that level by the end of the next halving and we could see problems by the following one (in 8 to 12 years).

That's the point: With RBF you can initially low ball and raise it as needed as new blocks and potential transactions appear. 
Transaction confirmation is thus an auction. Without RBF, it is a *first-price sealed-bid autcion* which is not incentive compatible and leads to eventually everyone overpaying. With RBF, fee bidding becomes an interactive English auction (concretely, a discriminatory price auction), which has true price discovery.
You cannot really "underpay" a fee. If you do not offer enough, your transaction does not get included; it only does if you pay enough *or above*.

Thanks for the explanation. No, I did not mean Charlie; he did nothing wrong other than being too much brave and too little vigilant. With the *The Bitcoin Foundation* felons, I meant, principally, Peter Vessenes, Mark Karpeles and Brock Pierce.
I fully agree also that hardforking is voluntary. I was just pointing that unless it has nearly unanimous consensus, it will create an altcoin, and the splitted sub-networks will be less useful (and thus less valuable) than the original one. That would be unfortunate, and probably avoidable if done with anticipation instead (what I mentioned: do 1M -&gt; 4M first, wait and see, then 4M -&gt; 8M in 2018 if safe and necessary).
And while I respect that you are OK with that, no, me I do not find *acceptable* to participate in a network whose consensus rules are decided by corporate representatives behind closed doors. That would be a generally uninteresting coin, even if it has both segwit and a higher 8M limit (which I value positively); I would rather run Ripple or Ethereum if I wanted that.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:44:29
Usually, an *altcoin* is a separate coin that is intentionally make like that.
A *hardfork* is an update where everyone is required to update. Since Bitcoin software does not have mandatory updates, if the proposed hardfork is controversial, it is possible that it ends up with two subchains and thus (accidentally) with two coins.

They are much less private. 
ETH does not have addresses but accounts, which are frequently reused. This erodes everyone's privacy: Even if I never reuse accounts, my payers and payees might do it, and thus they can unveil me. LTC has ~0 nodes and real use; the vast majority of "users" have it through an exchange, so no privacy and no real mixing capacities.
Some alts like ZEC or XMR (DASH is snake oil) do offer some increased privacy, but the lack of real use leaves little room to actual privacy (e.g., timing).

8M does not look catastrophic to me, if it has nearly unanimous consensus (if it does not, it will create an altcoin, as per BIP2 definitions).
But you are probably right about its reasonability. It would be more *raesonable* to get 4M-weight segwit first, wait and see, then plan to move to 8M next year if we find it safe.

I am not talking about wallet features. Even to craft a raw transaction to spend them, the payee needs first of all to be aware of those transactions that paid him. Yet, in that case, he would not be seeing them in the first place, because his wallet is quite simply not scanning for those kind of output scripts; it would not recognize them as own UTXOs.
If expressly made aware of those, Satoshi could in principle then make a raw transaction to spend them, but that is generally a bad assumption.

It does not make much sense that node costs are higher than transaction costs, at least not for the median user, with economically significant transactions (i.e., no on-chain lotteries, factoms or similar shit that just free ride on the network).

No, not in any proper way. Bitcoin transactions are smart contracts written in a FORTH-based script. Payments from A to B are an abstraction, they are a layer on top of programs in that script that use a certain signature format.
Since the beginning, the system is prepared so that new signature formats can be developed, to add new functionality as it is needed. Old software will not understand those new formats, so it necessarily returns true on them (independently of their validity, which of course the software cannot evaluate because the new functionality was still not defined when it was released). This is benign: unupgraded users are not able to use segwit in the first place, so they are unaffected; they will still display a warning message though.
Therefore, it is not really like everyone could spend segwit outputs. Users will only produce them once segwit activates, and then miners (on the subchain where it is activated, at least) will enforce their validity. If BIP148 produces a split (very unlikely), and the legacy subchain does not have segwit, then someone could replay segwit-producing transactions on the legacy chain and then spend them. However, if users do not prevent against replays they will lose money in any case, independently of who can or cannot spend segwit outputs. Also, segwit transactions will not be mined by default by legacy miners (they are non-standard) so any such event would be a **deliberate stealing** attempt, which would be irrational because that would render the legacy subchain worthless and further force people to the segwit subchain.

It depends much more on the degree of commitment than on the hashrate support. Let us suppose that you and I are regular transactors (or maybe just *potential* transactors) and then I am segwit-agnostic but you are strongly commited to it to the point that you want it now via BIP148. I can indiferently accept both segwit-enforcing or non-segwit-enforcing blocks, but you will only accept segwit. Therefore, I have an incentive for the BIP148 subchain too, because it is more valuable for me too (not only for you) as there I can transact with everyone while on the legacy one I can transact only with other segwit-agnostic users. This is why, even if it only has 5%, the BIP148 subchain will be more valuable (and hence it will not stay at 5% for long).
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:35:53
Yes, and it would still be very tight. For the last noncritical hardfork, it was 2 years (and it was only the protocol, not a proper blockchain hardfork). 
For the *critical* BIP50 it was 3 months, but for nodes not seeing reorganizations, the actual fork "triggering" block did not happen until 1.5 years later.

Replay: It is very relevant. 95% of miners upgraded to ETH-BailoutEdition and only 5% stayed with the "classic" original chain. Both went on; it would not be different for Bitcoin.
Wipeout: They are (very dangerously) assuming that bit 4 is for the hardfork, when indeed there might be a significant part of the hashrate using it as a BIP91 signaling alone (i.e., without the hardfork part).
It is very relevant too because, even if they start at 99%, miners will have every incentive to change their mind: 








So, SegWit2X without replay and without wipeout protection cannot be used.

And about inflation: Look for your own sources.

In 99.9% of the cases there will be just one chain, so we will be safe. If there is a split, though, you will need to consider a couple of things:
- Yes, in principle you have the coins on both chains, but this does not mean that it is safe to operate
- Transactions will be replied from one chain to the other, even by third parties that did not generate the transactions. You might not transact safely until you split your coins to different addresses for each different subchain.
- The legacy chain will be at a permanent risk of being wiped out. Jihan (Bitmain) might want to hardfork to remove that risk, so we might end up with 3 chains. You would need to update to hardforked software in order to use that chain, so it will no longer be Bitcoin but an altcoin.

I will be frank: I just want to go to the Moon. I am a law abiding family man with a public sector salary as my only source of income. I do not do anything *illegal*, not even gambling and not even copyright piracy. And I live in the over-banked first world.
Bitcoin solves nearly nothing for me. I can see how it is a more free, more just, more democratic, and overall better form of money, but I am largely skeptical about how *hyperbitcoinization* could make a better world, because of the huge inequality that it would create with overwhelmingly significant stashes in the hands of literal psychopaths like Ver, Jansens, Falkvinge or Popescu. It is inevitable though.
It is clear to me that a centralized Bitcoin would be worthless (it could pump and dump, like Ripple or Ethereum, but long term its value would be almost certainly 0). Only a decentralized, censorship resistant Bitcoin will go to the Moon.

@_date: 2017-06-12 14:25:18
No. Without consensus, a hardfork will almost certainly create a (temporary) split, and the hardforking chain will be still subject to wipeout risk.
The reason is simple: In a decentralized system, rules are negative, not positive. You can only validate if a set of rules (restrictions) were respected, but not if a set of rules (stipulations) were followed while building blocks and transactions. Because of that, in case of split, the *less restrictive* subchain can be wiped out by the *more restrictive* one: The former is not valid from the perspective of the latter, but both are valid from the perspective of the former.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:50:44
I mostly agree with the other commenters: No, it will almost certainly not be merged. 
However, that is completely irrelevant. SegWit2x is an altcoin, the new BitcoinClassic. The latest attack by mining guilds and "services" for a corporatocratic takeover of Bitcoin; it will not be the last. 
What would change if Core merged it? Absolutely nothing. Bitcoin is the set of consensus rules accepted by everyone in the network, not whatever comes from a centralized software repository. As attacks get more and more sophisticated, we might even see someday that a brain-controlled Wlad merges a contentious hardfork, and that day we bitcoiners will have to stop using "Core" upgrades.
I accept that hardforks should be possible (including, very especially, the ultimate wildcard against miner control: the hashing-algorithm change), but they need nearly unanimous agreement. As per BIP2, if two people stay in the legacy network and use it to meaningfully transact with each other, that network is *Bitcoin*, and the new "upgraded" one should find a new name.

No. Devs typically know better and should choose the safe parameters. If 12 are enough, there is no need for 24; if 12 are not enough, offer only 24.
Bitcoin uses 256-bit private keys, which correspond to 128-bit complexity. This is equivalent to 12 words.
Unless new vulnerabilities to ECC are discovered, 256 bits should be enough for the next half century at least, and this only if mega-powerful quantum computers become one day feasible. With classic computers, [they are safe forever](

In all the descriptions of the BIP148 uacomment that I have seen, it was rather clear that it was a commitment to enforce it. At least, as long as "it has enough support".
It was not just an "I would like that"; it was the expressed way to show support for BIP148 before it got coded and released.


But there is still nothing to enforce.

What I am saying is that pubkeys do not uniquely map to addresses, because there are dozens of different output scripts that you can construct with a pubkey.
Due to some inexplicable fuckery, blockchaininfo seem to extract the pubkey present in the genesis output (1st output of 1st tx of genesis block), serialize it in uncompressed form, pass it through 160bit hashing, and then display the address associated with that. Should they have serialized it in compressed form, it would be a different address, if they instead did p2sh embed of this, yet another address, witness-program, still a different address, p2sh embed of the witness program, different address... the combinations are plenty.
All the "latter transactions" are not pay to pubkey scripts and so are not accounted to Satoshi's wallet; they are more accurately described as being sent to a black hole (they could still be technically recoverable, but only through non-standard non-trivial low-level manipulations that are unreasonable to assume if the intended recipient is unaware).

Writing is poor for a research paper (even for a conference). Please use more careful language: You are not proving anything, just showing *evidence*; avoid qualifiers.

The biggest obstacle is dealing with wipeout protection, which is something that will stop most exchanges from even listing legacy-coins. Other than that, individual valuation will strongly depend on others' valuation, so the market could sharply move between the two equilibrium points: 1 legacy-coin = 1 BTC and 1 BIP148-coin = 1 BTC. This means that it could get stuck on the status quo even if a majority wants BIP148. But this just reflects reality: It could happen in the chain itself too, not just on its prediction market.

Well, I concede that encrypting with a hardcoded key, as they do, is quite idiotic. A cargo cult.
That said, when you are pwned, there is little things that you can do. It is their openly stated security model that your system is safe, so a custom encryption would be superfluous there.
Maybe, they could ask for an optional passphrase (this is what Electrum and Firefox password manager do) that would add a very slight degree of extra protection for when the app is not running, but this will not significantly change the security. 
Sensitive data should always go to encrypted volumes, protected at the system level.

Certainly, this does not need a blockchain. Just consider consistency in the succession of database states.


Like git with signed commits.


Traditional online banking has this already. Just use tlsnotary on your web statement of account after every transaction. You have an *incontrovertible audit trail* that however cannot prevent them from freezing your money or telling you with whom you are permitted to transact.
Ultimately, **the blockchain** solves the problem of, given a set of rules, anyone is able to determine if a given block belongs or does not belong to the valid chain. This is only reasonable with *dynamic membership multi-signatures*. Without, we are left with a master / set of masters that dictate the rules.
At this point, having a blockchain is a superfluous performance penalty. What recourse do users have if the masters create an invalid block and add it to the chain and go on building on top of it? (e.g., this has happened in Ripple: a hardfork forced KYC procedures for every user; the old chain (valid) halted and the new chain (invalid) went on unstoppably).

I would say that you can drive a car, where there is a box of strong steel around you, or you can mount a motorcycle, where your body is fully exposed. The latter is evidently less safe, but it has its use cases (and you can mitigate some of the extra risk with extra caution).
What to do with something like Jaxx? Ideally, use some sort of hardware wallet, or maybe do threshold signatures with multiple devices. That would be safe, but not much practical. Alternatively, you could ask for a strong encryption passphrase and demand that users always store it separately; still little practical. 
Encrypting with the PIN or with a weak password is another cargo cult.

Make sure that you have a recent version of Electrum. On "preferences" menu, fees tab, click "use dynamic fees", "edit fees manually" and "propose replace-by-fee" to "always".
Then, when you send a transaction, you can do any of these: change the priority with the slider (it automatically adjusts fees between different priorities) or set the exact fee. Most of the times, the former works reasonably well and it is of course much more intuitive.
In case of unusual high load, if the transaction that you have sent had low priority and it is taking long to confirm, you can then right click on it and bump up the fee ("replace by fee").

IIRC most of the big-block opposition was based on a couple of research papers from 2015 that found transmission problems starting at ~8 MB blocksizes. Then considering that Segwit worst-case block is ~4 MB and leaving a 2x security margin (the research ignored some secondary effects), they concluded that Segwit was already quite optimistic with respect to block sizes.
That said, many things have changed since then. Most notably, compact blocks and FIBRE, which make block size much less relevant. I would say that it is now IBD (and not mining advantage) the most relevant concern against bigger blocksizes. 


I would generally agree: "Blockchains do not scale" (they have superlinear scalability) so on-chain scaling is limited. But we were talking about a rather moderate doubling, not general on-chain scaling. 
So, is a "modest blocksize increase" safe? With modern block relaying, it looks like it is. Segwit proposes a quadrupling (in the worst case) and has found little opposition. 
Also, I agree that it is reckless to propose going straight to 4 MB typical and 8 MB worst-case in September. It would make much more sense to Segwit first, then wait and see before further doublings.
But for me, as I said, what is more reckless is the *firing Core* narrative. They are literally proposing the establishment of a steering committee for Bitcoin. Something that would kill its decentralized nature. It would be going back to the times of the corrupt Bitcoin Foundation, with a felon CEO and a benevolent dictator "chief scientist". Gedankenexperiment: Captains of the industry meet behind closed doors and conclude that Core is not adequately listening to their needs and so decide to make an incompatible (hardfork) change to 8.1M blockweight limit. Would that be acceptable?

What is far fetched is thinking that Satoshi would be writing custom scripts that scan all possible versions of addressing script outputs to all of his possible keys (including the ones that are supposed unspendable, lol). I know nobody who does that, and for a reason.
What is the compressed-key version of that address? what is the v0 witness program p2wpkh version of it? what about its p2sh-p2wpkh? People simply do not know about them nor burn coins to them. They only know about that 1A1zP1... one because of the incredibly misleading blochchaininfo fuckery, that incorrectly shows it as the depository of the genesis output. As I linked above, proper block explorers do not do that. It is a bug, an accident, something that would not have been at all expectable, much less something people should be relying on. Tons of coins have been lost because of that type of assumptions.

There was a time where SatoshiDice alone payed more fees than the rest of the network combined. Their transactions were not economically significant, though (provably fair lotteries do not need a blockchain), but fees were *so tiny* that this did not stopped them from flooding the network and making blocks much larger than needed.
In what you propose, miners would vote diversely. However, network connectivity is very hierarchic. Bigger miners can typically afford better bandwidths and latencies, so they will be incentivized in trying to use it to outcompete their lesser connected competition. The most frequent transactors would, they too, vote for larger blocksizes, especially if they are not holders (e.g., factoms, diamond registrations and on-chain shitcoin trading), even if blocks are already big and fees already small.
I am afraid that the *individual* incentives for transactors would tend towards smaller fees, even when the *collective* incentives are for smaller blocks. There would be some balancing, like that of the flexcap proposal, but there might be a Tragedy-of-the-Commons risk.

Now seriously, the game theory aspects of BIP148 alone and isolated [are pretty much straightforward]( The key element for its success is that the vast majority of the non-UASF folk are segwit-neutral, not segwit-hostile, while the UASF folk want segwit at all costs. Therefore, [the most intolerant wins](
Now, of course, this is for the ideal case. What happens if we have a frankensegwit subchain in parallel too? We could split in 3 subchains, and then I expect that the non-segwit one will die (shockingly, the only one backed by Core) because of polarization of both hashers and economic users. Frankenswegwit will cleanly fork, with wipeout protection (and hopefully, replay protection too) and we will get two bitcoins: People's BTC-UASF and Corporate BTC-FRANKEN, and the sum of both will fall below $300.
Notice that without BIP148 we could probably still reach that same situation, though.
@_date: 2016-05-25 20:45:12
There is an even more radical point which is based on the evaluation of how bitcoins become valuable. Many think it is just foolish pump-and-dump speculation not that different from tulipmania (other than scale and duration). Stakeholders (**hodlers**), however, think that they can have -and preserve- a subjective value and thus serve as a *store of value*.
Then, if an altchain supersedes Bitcoin, cryptocurrency would have failed as a store of value. It would have become clear that the successor could also get superseded by a third contender afterwards, and so on, so we would have empirically proved that *hodling* is irrational. Adding the fact that blockchain incentives need a valuable token, this leads to the conclusion that if Bitcoin ever dies, cryptocurrency dies.
@_date: 2017-06-16 08:49:53
Tradeoffs! I see tradeoffs, everywhere.
A moderate increase (like the one offered by Segwit) will certainly increase full-node costs, but it will more significantly reduce the transaction fees (as they are on an inelastic supply boundary).
I would say that I am a typical user. I transact regularly, not very extensibly: Like 1 transaction every other day on average.
Last year, I pointed at the observation that my full-node costs were still much higher (nearly by an order of magnitude) than my transaction costs. Today, that has changed and my transactions costs have become somewhat larger (my usage is more or less the same).
For decentralization, it does not make sense that node costs are greater than transaction costs, but it does not make much sense that they are much less either. Needless to say, I am against any central planning that attempted to direct the balance on this tradeoff; however, I think that the community can find ways of decentralized coordination to increase the capacity as it is needed. E.g., via persmissionless sidechains, or even as a hardfork that achieves nearly unanimous consensus.
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:44:47
Me too. Stricto sensu, softforking is not incentive compatible (other than maybe to solve a bug that could immediately decimate the value of the mining). In a sense, it escapes me how would rational miners upfront support UASF instead of wait and see. But hey, the reality is that there they are:  
Even BitFury might opportunistically jump in.
But then again, I am convinced that most stakeholders prefer a segwit-less status quo than a (certainly damaging) war, if they have to choose. The big forking risks will come from SegWit2X more than from BIP148.

You are affirming that, even being permissionless, mining can produce a stable rent. This is hard to believe, as much as there could be some "secret sauce" in ASIC design.
Electricity cost is not very close to total income, yes, but the difference is mostly the risk premium.


This is misleading. ASICBOOST reduces the computational cost of each hashing. You can call that "reduced electric consumption" but, in reality, you can consume the same and do *more hashes* per time period. So, in all effect, it increases the hashrate, and it does so by as much as 30%. Since there are additional operations needed, we could reduce the final practical advantage maybe to something like 20-25%; anyway I doubt it is as low as 15%.

The beauty of protocol upgrades in Bitcoin is that they are truly voluntary processes: In a softfork, some upgrade to activate it. In a hardfork, everyone must upgrade (or else found a new altcoin).
Therefore, we are free to accept the softfork part (BIP91) and at the same time reject the hardfork. If SegWit2X brings 80% of the hashrate to activate Segwit for everyone, then it is a win. They can fork off later, if they want.

Notice that the hashrate global share is irrelevant here; only the absolute numbers matter. For instance, a miner that pre-fork observed an average of 1 block every 4 hours, will expect immediately post-fork 1 block every 4 hours, independently on how is the split, and until difficulty readjusts.

For every buyer there is a seller at the crossed price; there cannot be any *net* money flowing in or coming out. This is the only conserved quantity. Entire supply multiplied by the last crossed price (*market capitalization*) is not conserved.
If the "entire bitcoin for sale supply" vanished, as you mention, then we would not go from 1 to 100 but from 1 to ∞ (or arbitrarily large, as no real-world exchange lets you buy infinitesimal fractions of a bitcoin). This is obviously not what I meant.
Really, the *net* influx / outflux of capital is always zero. At the base level, there is no USD&lt;-&gt;BTC conversion, it is just USD changing hands and BTC changing hands, both conserved.
You could argue, maybe, that as the price goes up miners and holders are more willing to sell and as the price goes down they become more conservative. In reality, most empirical observations tend to indicate the opposite: The feedback is positive with the price or, said more colloquially, holders tend to FOMO up and FOMO down. This is the basis of many boom-bust models.
In Bitcoin, at least, it is clear that the BTC traded volume has gone down, but overall the USD volume has gone up as the price has increased. This would certainly require more USD moving to and from exchanges, because fiat is quite slow and adjusting its velocity is inelastic (notice though, that in recent years SEPA has evolved from 3-day to 1-day transfer times). There is the only point where I see any "extra capital" needed from somewhere.

They specify that they calculate the historical volatility over 10-day windows. This is a rather sensible definition. The values that they give, ~45, look like expressed *per mill* and without any time-window normalization (e.g., on Kraken euro I get ~5% for the past 10 days). This corresponds to 1.4% *per diem*, which looks reasonable.
Yes, Bitcoin has seen a much larger volatility, but this was already three weeks ago. You can see the peak in their chart around 140؉ (for 10 days, i.e., over 3x that of today).
So, a bit opportunistic? Maybe. But it is true that Bitcoin's volatility has been consistently going down over the last years, and it is now able to occasionally surpass that of major fiat currencies over time windows of several days.

No, but Bitcoin is the most adopted and most secure one. It is a system that requires global consensus to work, and a single consensus system is more valuable than multiple, incompatible ones. I am not saying that there will be only one chain, but that if there are many, they are more useful if made compatible with each other (e.g., sidechain pegging).
In a similar way, debasing the currency (colored coins, "tokens", etc.) is not incentive compatible. Speculation-driven fluctuations bring the current situation, but we will eventually move back to the equilibrium state of a single consensus system and a single token of value.

He is acting rationally. His business has always been based on externalizing the costs to the Bitcoin network while extracting wealth from it. Satoshidice, Coinapult and Shapeshift are all based on spamming the blockchain with transactions that are not economically significant, free riding on the node operators' validation service.
Transaction fees force him to at least pay something in exchange for that free riding, and this diminishes his profits (but, notice, not the utility of what he offers: provably fair lottery does not need a blockchain, IOU issuance does not need a blockchain, and centralized shitcoin exchange does not need a blockchain either).

Not only we **can** deny that: It is widely corroborated by empirical observations. The majority of the hashrate has had the possibility of enabling larger blocksizes since many months ago. They have not.
If they want further increases past what Segwit offers, that is fine (I want that too). But why not move step by step? Why would it have to be all or nothing? Why still many *fucking* empty blocks? It does not make any sense at all, unless they are trying to hold the network hostage and/or undeservedly demand higher level of control.

Yes, this is what I said. "Hardware can fail, so you still need a paper wallet with the seed in it."
That paper backup is the weakest link. You need to protect it very well because it is as good as the private keys.
You can protect it with a password, but unless it is a very strong password it does not really solve the problem. And if it is a strong password, then you need to write it too and safely guard it too. This is why backup-seed + password is strictly weaker, less flexible and otherwise equivalent to 2-of-2 multisig.
On the other hand, with 2-of-3 multisig you can store the backups with minimal protection (your wallet, your house, a trusted friend/family) and you are still good if one of those gets compromised or lost.

Yes, that is what I said. And that max weight is 4M. So again, what is 1,01 MB Segwit?
Please read again my avant-previous reply: I agree that 8M weight will be an altcoin if it does not have **unanimous support**. Iff it does have unanimous support (not a majority!), i.e., iff everyone either "upgrades" or abandons the original network, then we would be able to call that altcoin still *Bitcoin*.
That is by virtue of definition. *Bitcoin* can be defined in many different ways. Definitions are as good as they are useful, and that one -which is the one used in BIP2, with a lengthy rationale justifying it- looks rather useful to me, especially because, in the end, the definition of what is *Bitcoin* is more a social matter than a technical one. 
You might find that that is too much pragmatic and, in a general case, I would agree. E.g., even if everyone "upgrades" to something like Ripple or Ethereum, which have fully different incentives and are thus much more centralized than today's Bitcoin, to a point where we would agree that they are *qualitatively* different, it would then be improper to call that thing *Bitcoin*. That said, in the concrete case of FrankenSegwit-Bitcoin, 8M block weight does not constitute, in my view, any significantly qualitative change; its centralization force is probably quite moderate (but notice that I still very strongly propose that we wait-and-see before with segwit alone), to the point that, iff everyone upgrades, I would still call it Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:33:34
I tend to agree with you. Closed door meetings are a very bad way of achieving community wide consensus, and it could set an awful precedent: back to the times of the profoundly corrupt Foundation.
That said, a very moderate increase in the size limit will probably not affect decentralization in any significant way. Four months ago, I argued that my transaction costs were still much smaller than my node costs:  Today, that has changed, and I would eagerly support the extra costs brought by somewhat larger blocks if that eased a bit the fee pressure.
Also, hardforks that have very wide consensus (i.e., nearly unanimous) should be possible. I ignore if 2MB blocksizes (with some alteration to the witness weighting) could achieve that degree of consensus, but I guess it can. Technically, that would be an *altcoin*, but in the end the definition of *Bitcoin* is a social matter, not a technical one.

As those are corruptible, a system under them is weaker, less robust and less valuable.

Sure it is! There is nothing inherently fake with signals in uacomments. In a MASF, signaling means readiness i.e., it is principally a miner-to-user signal of when to start enforcing the new rules. In a UASF, all that burden is removed by fixing instead a flagday. Therefore, any "signaling" in it is not about block count nor (obviously) node count, just about *intent*. 
You pretty much signal the same *intent* in the ua (from a BIP148 release) or in the uacomment, because it was never about a commitment to death. It was first said that it would only go through with an *economic majority* behind; later it was seen that it can also succeed (albeit, more messily) with a *significant enough economic minority*. Some will chicken out, some will have been fake-signaling all the time, but as long as a BIP148 sub-chain is workable, it will be there.
Personally, but I think that most of the other UASFers agree, I will be prepared to run both a BIP148 node and a legacy node. This way, in the very unlikely case that the blockchain forks, I will use it to split my bitcoins and sell the legacy-coins.

Mike Hearn used to vehemently defend a central planning to keep fees permanently small, even if such thing demanded moving to permanent inflation. Strictly speaking, you are right. However, if fees are really really small compared to the block subsidy, the difference provided by rational behavior might be insignificant enough.


I do not agree. Mining is permissionless and so necessarily rent free. This implies that amortization and operational costs are overwhelmingly pressing.

That is cryptocurrency, not blockchain. Blockchain is a database used my most of those. However: I) This is not novel at all; git is a blockchain too, in a certain sense. II) It is not even strictly necessary. E.g., have a look at ByteBall, which is a cryptocurrency but does not use a blockchain.


No, not particularly. If bitcoins become worthless, its blockchain becomes useless.


No, this is not true as far as I know. *Blockchain* is the buzzword du jour, but it really does not have any really useful application other than currency. Banks and governments are FOMOing and try to tame the beast to be saved from irrelevance; they will miserably fail.
Timestamping can piggyback on the Bitcoin blockchain only because bitcoins are valuable. Anyway, this is not particularly interesting for Wikileaks: As long as several independent parties keep copies of the digests, nobody can alter the content of the not-yet-leaked files.
You do not need a *world computer* either. If you do not trust the cloud, you can use remote attestation, which is much more powerful and efficient. The vast majority of Ethereum/smart contract "applications" are useless or stupid, not really decentralized, and can work better with multisig. The only key aspect that benefits from the blockchain there is actually the *money* aspect.

I'll wait two weeks, as everyone quickly reorganizes to BIP148 chain. By definition, segwit-neutral folk will equally accept either BIP148 blocks or legacy blocks, but BIP148 folk will only accept BIP148, so they will be more valuable and rational miners will produce them. It is not a strong cryptographic guarantee, but it is a strong economic incentive.


Brinkmanship requires boldness and unblinking commitment. As I said: *It is a game of chicken and "UASF at all cost" is the only strategy that would lead to UASF. If it is "UASF if..." miners would call the bluff and we would go on with the status quo (Schelling point).*

In Ethereum, you cannot do an initial block download anymore with a regular machine. The vast majority of the advertised "nodes" are synchronized with "fast mode" which means that they trust whatever miners say and do not validate at all. What is worse, miners themselves probably do mostly SPV mining. 
Anyway, this is not a problem at all for Ethereum, because it is constructed around a super-powerful undethronable Foundation. It could be a problem for EthereumClassic, though (if it had any real use).

There is no "genesis address". The coinbase output script in the genesis block (and all the early blocks) is p2pk not p2pkh, so it references no addresses. However, Blockchaininfo does incomprehensibly display an address associated to it; notice that good block explorers do not have this flaw:

This is technical nonsense and it is not clear what does it mean. There is no such thing as "base size". Segwit removes the blocksize limit and puts in its place a 4M blockweight limit. As a result, blocksizes (real blocks, full of real, on-chain, actual, 1st-layer transactions) larger than 1MB (and actually limited to 2.1-2.2MB, if miners are profit maximizing -- or ~3.7MB if not).
So, what does it even mean "2MB base size"? Does it mean 8M weight limit? Does it mean that non-segregated witnesses get the discount too? Does it mean that it uses a different weighting (probably even more misaligned)?

If I understood it correctly, the big centralization risk does not come from the technical specifics (nearly everyone agrees that a moderate increase should be safe enough), but from the hardfork nature, especially if done in a rushed way and without very wide (nearly unanimous) consensus.
Just as an example, SegWit2X proposes changes to Core and ignores all the other consensus-compatible implementations. It also changes the dev group from a loose one to a formal one. These two are rather major dev-centralization concerns.

The problem is that such attack would be costly. The pool operator would still need to pay for the shares diverted to attack. 
As an example, Ethereum has even more centralized pools. Their hardfork had the support of all the big pools and the powerful Foundation, yet they could not coordinate to kill Ethereum-Classic (the original chain) which initially had less than 5% of the hashrate.

The number of valid combinations is around 2^(76). Now, it depends on what is the concrete algorithm, but 76 bits are generally considered to be within the realms of crackability by a big botnet or supercomputer. I do not know of any specialized bip39-order cracker, so it is hard to make a more accurate estimation, but I would guess that even if it was not crackable today, it will probably be in a few years. Also, 12-word orders are trivially crackable.

Most empirical evidence tends to show the opposite: Cycles of the standard deviation of relative returns are *positively correlated* with transaction volume.

Now I am lost. What is 2MB hardfork *without* Segwit? Because 8M weight ("2MB base size") and status quo with 2MB limit are fully different things. 


We might need 4MB eventually, but that is unchartered territory. Why not, instead of *quadrupling*, start by only *doubling* (immediate; nearly everyone is already upgraded except miners)? And then, next year, wait and see, and move to 3MB or 4MB only if needed and only if safe?
A rushed hardfork is very irresponsible for an upgrade like that. It should be used only in case of a critical bug, or to respond to an existential threat (e.g., changing the hashing algorithm).




It depends on the update. If it is compatible with Bitcoin (segwit case), then nothing. If it is incompatible, then you will be on an altcoin. This might be fine and that altcoin might be more valuable than Bitcoin, or not. A schism is almost certainly value damaging.
Also, Bitcoin is not a corporatocracy; if you think it is, I am afraid you might be seriously misunderstanding it.
Look, I try to be pragmatic. In the end, the definition of what is *Bitcoin* is a social matter, not a technical one. Still, definitions are as good as they are useful. This is the strength of the definition used in BIP2: Bitcoin is the "original" chain as long as there are people meaningfully using it.
This implies that you need to convince nearly everyone of going straight to 4MB (instead of gradually). Good luck with that: I am still unconvinced, and many other users are apparently even much harder to convince than me.

You need to use logarithmic scales. The 100-&gt;1000 abrupt increase in the last three months of 2013 has little to do with the recent increase. In logscale, you can notice a stable uptrend since mid 2015 that has somewhat (very slightly) accelerated in the last half year.

What I am saying is that eventually it might be safe to raise the weight limit to 8M. It would be much preferable to do one doubling at a time, i.e., segwit first, then hardfork in one year.
Moving straight to 8M is risky, yet it will probably not be catastrophic (I have not thoroughly tested, but I will probably keep my node running; I *could* adapt to that). On the other hand, a schism will not destroy Bitcoin either, but it can severely damage its value.
I could live with 8M block weight limit, if it achieves nearly unanimous consensus. Or, said in another way, the problem is with the *hardfork* itself, not its technical details.

I am a bit disappointed that your "proof" fails to prove anything. You can speculate as much as you want. The Lightning network will be built by preferential attachment to frequent transactors; that is why I think that the most probable topology would mimic the current transaction topology, which is clearly hubless, and close to scale-free.
You do not seem to understand what is a hub-and-spoke network topology. Sure, in scale-free networks there is a big degree heterogeneity (also, weight heterogeneity in this case). This does not mean that you can distinguish two classes, nor that the bigger players can have any bad influence (they are trivially circumvented).
There is no "lending": Routes are not unique and intermediate channels can equally get unbalanced or rebalanced at every payment. Bitcoin is a closed system: Any user can only pay after she has earned (excluding miners, which are not in the LN anyway) so, while your set of payers and that of payees can be mostly disjoint, the coins end up cycling back to you. This is the case on-chain and it will not be different on-LN.
Also, nodes will probably ask for a tiny positive fee for unalancing and may offer a tiny negative fee for rebalancing their channels. This will ensure that channel states stay in good shape for as long as possible.

@_date: 2017-06-21 14:31:55
This is very unlikely. Most of the exchange-&gt;exchange transactions can already happen off-chain with zero reduction in security (basically, you are already trusting third parties). Liquid, or maybe even Teechan will be useful here, not Lightning.
Lightning is specially for microtransactions and it is (soft-)limited to 0.042 BTC. The most probable channel topology will mimic the current transaction topology, as this is what is most efficient. This is hubless, that is, scale free.
The vast majority of LN users will make channels with their most common transactors, which are very diverse both geographically and in degree heterogeneity. Non-HODLers and other fiat-worshipers may have a channel with their favorite exchange, but I doubt this affects the global topology any significantly and, as long as those exchanges are diverse, it will not lead to the formation of any hubs.

Yes. The genesis block has valid proof of work, but it is not spendable because, being the first, only Satoshi could have mined it. Moreover, Bitcoin was launched many months after being announced (presumably, to coordinate the launch with as many early participants as possible), and the first reward halving did not happen until four whole years after. These facts should give an idea about how much attention Satoshi put in having a *fair* launch. Contrast this with all the pre-mined, insta-mined, ico-ed scams that followed.
