I agree the toys probably aren't great later on in life when you finally get them but you know when they are great...when I'm 25. Another thing the memories are important but you know what memories I wanna look back on when I'm older? Not working from age 21 for 45 years...idk man I couldn't handle losing that shot at easy wealth.

Hm so basically there is no good way of getting bitcoins anymore other than purchasing them for the going rate?

I cant really sit at my computer right now so chat service wouldnt be good for me however I appreciate your help so if you could just comment back that would be fine. My first question is about mining. I understand now that bitcoins at this moment are worth 820 usd. Now I've heard about mining which to my understanding is basically creating? or finding? bitcoins. Does this mean that if I've mined a bitcoin I've essentially just made 820 dollars?

So at any point in time there cant be more than 21 million bitcoins in existence?

Wow well I wasnt going to try mining anyway as its one of those things that sounds to good to be true. Now I'm seeing this site that lets you do things like sit on a website for 5 minutes and it pays out in uBTC. Is this legit and what is a uBTC? Is that 1 bitcoin or much less than one bitcoin to seem better to people.

Well all of the rich people and corporations in this country are total asses I guess.
