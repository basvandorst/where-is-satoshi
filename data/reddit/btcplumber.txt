Since the bitcoin price will most probably increase as a result of an economic meltdown it wouldn't make sense to sell it before.

I think they would buy thousands upon thousands of toy alien creatures, and then fly over a major city somewhere in broad daylight, parachute them in..... for an "alien invasion" prank.

It sounds to me like most of the core developers are in favor of not getting in a hurry and doing something stupid. That's the consensus that exists right now.

According to the U.S. governments own numbers... the dollar has lost almost 97 or 98% of it's purchasing power since 1913.  They took all of that into account... and then they glossed over it a bit to make it look a little better.

True... but when you take into account that median household income figures are distorted by the concentration of wealth in the U.S... high unemployment numbers (which don't include people that gave up looking for work...lol)  half or nearly half of the U.S. pop. is taking some form of government financial assistance. Public debt has increased 5,941 times since 1914... while the population grew 3.2 times.  The whole system being propped up on Q.E... Where does that leave us... does the average American in 2015 enjoy more spending power with his dollars, than the average American in 1915?  I will concede that most of us do enjoy a more comfortable life by virtue of technological advancement... but i think it was probably easier to buy necessities (food, home, tools etc.) 100 years ago.

The U.S. can't afford it's welfare programs... last time I checked we were something like 17 trillion dollars in debt.
When you include "unfunded liabilities" (which include welfare programs, particularly social security and medicare ) it adds up to something more like 127 trillion dollars (according to "usdebtclock.org").

Don't you think having "bit" as a part of every name is akin to: BigMacs, McDoubles, McChicken, McShakes, etc..  Granted McDonalds is a highly successful business, but if Mc is to McDonalds then ?? is to bitcoin.  It's not "bit"... IMO

I am a plumber, and I would bet that I am in the 99th+ percentile in terms of being technologically behind, with respect to the r/bitcoin community.  Measured against the general population I would fair better, but in no way would I describe myself as technologically savvy.  I have never been paid in bitcoin... but hopefully that changes someday.

What is the exchange rate of toilet paper to bitcoin?

I am just a simple unfrozen caveman plumber, and I don't understand the advanced technical aspects of bitcoin... at all.  That being said, as an observer from a political viewpoint, XT looks and smells like bullshit orchestrated by hostile actors to me.  When the overwhelming majority of developers and miners are saying "whoa... slow down"  while two charismatic guys implement what is essentially a 51 percent attack, and all the while it's being propagandized as this common sense, populist idea, that represents the true ideology behind bitcoin.  If you were say... the banking interests, the big business, or Government, etc... this seems like a very solid strategy to undertake in an effort to cripple or take control of bitcoin.

Maybe comparing these charts is a matter of apples and oranges, but apples and oranges do share a great many things in common. The first is a 100 year chart of the DJIA.  The second is a model of the typical asset bubble.  Look at the non log, not adjusted for inflation chart of the Dow, and compare to the asset bubble.  I think it might bear a striking resemblance to the typical asset bubble, had the feds not intervened after the nasdaq crash, and then after the housing crash.

The "Federal" Reserve serves as the hinges for the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington.  While you're at it... why don't you quote us some verses from the book of Genesis.

Lets say: if the average person takes one dump per day, the duration of this dump is one minute, and we know there are 1440 minutes in a day, and roughly 7 billion people, then there should be about 4.8 million people dumping right now.
