the clouds end up too thin in the modified.
imo the "crypto modified" setting is only applicable for 1d candle and up, since a candle would represent 24/7 trading instead of normal stock exchange hours. 
I view at 4h and lower (4h, 1h, 30m, 15m), which makes the "crypto" setting inapplicable because its the same passage of time for each candle as stock trading.

this time it was daca and chip, not the wall. mitchell put a bipartisan bill with the wall on the table as well, but trump turned that down.  now all they can do is a CR with a clause thay chip and daca will be discussed.

look at ichimoku charts. it is based on trends.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:45:49
not op. how do i do this? i have a transaction in limbo for weeks because i was dumb.

TBH i'm not surprised, looking at his ichimoku chart. Senkou B is flat as fuck, it would inevitably pull the the price down to equilibrium. 
ichimoku signals intend to give trending signals. the moment it is a false-start, you sell and try again next time. 
OP appears to have bought either from kumi breakout on Jan 4. However, the Kijun was WAY too far below in the cloud, it would make a risky stop-loss. What should have been a tip-off is that despite the price contiuing upward, the Kijun refuse to go up. I personally would sell at the Tenkan-sen crossover, @ $1600 on Jan 8. 
Instead, OP is the captain sinking with the ship.

the difference is conflict of interest.  Theres a big reason why the fed reserve is its own entity in the govt, and not run by a business.  
if a single business would be allowed to fabricate their own money, they would manipulate it so that they would bd the moat powerful business in the world.
this is happening with bitfinex if we discover that USDT is not backed.

if he was trading ichimoku signals he would have exited long before the crash. I did.

Banks do. Wouldn't it just be amazing that crypto was dependant on banks all along?

Much of the discussions on the client are on here.. especially the varieties of clients available..


Wikipedia is pretty well maintained imo. If you have a point of contention, you can provide feedback in the talk page.  If you want a simpler explanation, switch to English simple.


It's great that there's multiple clients, that focus on usability as well as function!

There are businesses that inject fees into your transaction, bumping it's priority. Tbh I forget the name of anyway, it was last year.

Sorry, I typod, it wasn't $50 a day, it was $5 (got mixed up with the other guy that bought a single)
@_date: 2013-08-29 17:27:16
0.05 BTC/day = ~4-6 dollars a day (let's go $5 a day).
$5x30 days = $150 after 30 days, minus power (let's say about 10 bucks ) = $140.  That was the price of a jalapeno back then i believe.

Yes. He ordered his way back when it was lower.
