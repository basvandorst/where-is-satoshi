I'm mean is any of that data actually good news? 
Very few people employed with low prospects of growth, crypto trading is going to provide very few jobs which considering the already big problem with unemployment many countries have is not such a good thing. 
Their profits being so high is even worse, that's a lot of money very few people are taking, plus is taken from the community it feeds on, which is neither good not so morally correct. 
The only thing this tweet makes clear to me is that considering the problems we have with inequality and consumer exploit crypto exchanges might pose some serious problems,  we should at least start some serious debate regarding wheater we think this is ok or not before growing to a larger scale where it could be to late.

Well sorry, but i'm doubtfull that this will spontaneously evolve in that direction. 
We already saw with many examples of bitconnect and the likes that we cannot pretend everybody involved with crypto has good intentions and their actions will lead to benefit for the consumer, especially in such an unregulated market. 
My opinion is that the more a exchange will consolidate its position the less the consumer will be granted any sort of benefit. There is the risk of a monopoly like treatment the likes of Comcast pulls out, where a couple of Exchanges fake competition to stay out of antitrust range especially since this is becoming a very high entry CAPEX sector where it's difficult to enter.
I think it is a seriously concerning theme which we can't liquidate by saying everything is gping to be alright
