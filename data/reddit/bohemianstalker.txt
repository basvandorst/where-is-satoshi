They propably get it 1000x better than you do, for they have hired many experts who understand whole situation. And trust me any bank thinking about making even relatively small move with millions of euros seeing the possibility that someone gets control over the network and your money(bitcoins) puts the bank off bitcoin idea thousand miles (and rightfully).

What are you trying to prove? When alcohol was illegal it was much worse. There were no taxes for the goverment and crime (mafia) was born ,-) and stronger than ever.

Smart move from bank's perspective. The way Ghash acted and the lax approach of bitcoin foundation (&amp;main figures) was horrible. The possibility of someone taking control of so called "decentralized curency" keeps banks and big players away from bitcoin.
edit: figures

Man please stop repeating the mantra about 51% not being able to take control of btc or destroying the btc. The thing is the sole possibility of someone having 51% control is a huge problem to bitcoin (and I am holding bitcoins btw). We are trying to create world where bitcoin is the main currency, but as long as someone can pull 51% like ghash we will never obtain it - nobody (except gamblers and fanatics) want's to have millions of USD controlled by some group that is basically saying - we are the good guys and we will not abuse our power! To me Andreas is moron, yeah bitcoin can exist in it's current form, even being ten times stronger market cap wise - but it is still leftovers, and very small leftovers from the financial sector. 8Bln is nothing.

It is exactly not like that.

People lost because they bought too expensive. It was their choice of greed to think it will go up, except it went down.

except there are more merchants, more customers and more transactions

Under 12KG - which means night table from solid wood like pine - 50 USD packaging , shipping, handling included! For some lunchbox etc it would be 25 USD.

You mean those 1000 usd shipping costs? that was a bug, I think i fixed it now :)
@_date: 2015-02-27 00:46:28
maybe I could create something smaller for you? Say wooden bitcoin lunchbox or american/bitcoin styled postal box? :) This way I can offer lower shipping.
