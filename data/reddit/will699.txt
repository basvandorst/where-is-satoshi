Might as well be on robinhood if you are only investing that much since it has “free” trades

This is wrong but okay

Honestly the healthiest move i’ve seen in july

Once it hits 4200 it may fall back to 4100 but I don’t see it going any lower

The point is the $60 is the fee.... it usually hovers around $5-10. Name another exchange with a $60 fee, i’ll wait.

Yup. They wouldn’t let anyone buy Bitcoin today till an hour ago, you could only sell. Haven’t seen anything like this in the couple months I’ve been on robinhood.  Have always had money Coinbase as well but might make the full switch soon.

Also good for day trading since no fees :)
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:15:51
Do you have any suggestions for good exchanges for day trading?

Will probably bounce off 5800, to maybe 5300/400. I only see major buying opportunities when it is bouncing off the future resistance points. ��
