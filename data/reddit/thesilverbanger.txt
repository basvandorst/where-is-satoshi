How should someone remove their coins from Coinbase when that's all they've ever used for buying and holding bitcoin?  
  
I want to hold my own coins.  
  
* Cold storage is my ideal solution for what little btc I have.  
* I would use another app/wallet other than Coinbase if the new app was safe and secure. I don't want my coins where they can be lost/stolen/or frozen.  
 
Any tutorials or recommendations would be appreciated.

When you say, "the grammar and tone between Satoshi's writing and Dr. Wright's various posts, emails, and tweets is interesting," are you taking into account his [Quora]( posts, which are long form and varied? I haven't read the white paper by Satoshi before, but I'm sure people will be comparing his posts on Quora to the writing style of the white paper.

What exactly do you mean by "taxes are cheaper than credit cards?"

Nice try, Dorian.

Intriguing... Care to elaborate the metaphor?

This has been bugging me for a while. I don't like surprises.

Thanks for the thorough response. It makes intuitive sense to me and I'm grateful for the clarification.

That's great, I suppose. But for a million dollars in funding, it should really work seamlessly IMO.

Is it done? I'm not a github aficionado.

Can you think of some examples of common subscription services that are fleecing customers in this way? Xboxlive comes to mind.

Didn't Mike raise a million dollars for that lighthouse/hourglass Bitcoin wallet? Did he finish that or return any of the money if not?

Thank you for the explanation. I'm ignorant of such things.
@_date: 2015-04-16 02:13:17
I like the way you think.

I think this is a key point. It's more fun to earn your way in than to buy your way in. Especially when you're just poking around to see what Bitcoin is all about.  
  
One interesting way of earning btc could be through referrals. Someone trusts you enough to ask for a referral on something (insurance, entertainment, politics, etc.), you should get a finder's fee in Bitcoin when they make a purchase.  
 
Meh, just my two satoshis...

Thanks for the clarification. So Hourglass will be open source too?
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:57:40
I might be into that. Send me a message with the details.

Is it altruism or idiocy that explains why people are donating to this guy's startup with no share in the venture?
@_date: 2015-04-16 01:30:11
I thought as much. Thanks for the interesting reply.
@_date: 2015-04-15 22:11:36
You nailed it. This is one of those regulatory back-breakers that seems like it would crush an app like this if it were enforced.
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:23:42
Are you voluntarily donating every month or are you on an automatic setup?
@_date: 2015-03-02 23:15:09
Cool, thanks for the response!
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:26:11
That's an intriguing idea.

Just checked his site. I listen to both his shows, but I don't recall him mentioning that [he accepts Bitcoin]( That's great to know.  
  
How would one go about setting up small, recurring transactions to him in Bitcoin?

What if the headline reads, "Where will you be when btc hits $10,000?"
