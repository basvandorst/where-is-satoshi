You people are going to lose a lot of money

i didn't say it has no place.
the problem is looking at it like it's an investment. it has no inherent value and it's going to collapse. either naturally or when governments start to really worry about it.

when you invest in something like the stock market, or futures, or a business or gold or something, it has inherent value. bitcoin does not. the marketplace is speculating about nothing, and sooner or later it's going to come to crash hard and lots of people on this board are gonna lose money. i would just be careful, is all i'm saying. i've already known folks who have lost 10s of figures from bitcoin, and this is before governments have tried to kill it. so either bitcoin stays pretty much worthless and the bubble will burst, or governments will outwardly try to destroy it.

it's not jealousy. it's the truth

well ok.
gold is a real thing, it is not infinite, and people actually use it.
bitcoin is theoretically finite, but it isn't a real thing. it doesn't really exist as a physical thing, it's an idea. on top of that, it has no actual use except "it's an alternative to actual money" which in practice means it's used to buy drugs or weapons or things you don't want the government to find out about. 
it's a cryptocurrency. bitcoin is an interesting experiment, i can appreciate the libertarian aspects of it, but "investing" in it is just asking for trouble. it's gambling.

Well I think you know the answer and I think you can distinguish between a real finite thing and a cryptocurrency

i mean, i like bitcoin because it's hard to trace. that doesn't make it "valuable" that means one can get away with certain things without big brother knowing about it
