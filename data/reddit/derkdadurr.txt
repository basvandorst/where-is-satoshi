Goldman Sachs is a very smart company. I wouldn't be surprised if they're finding their way into the bitcoin world. If they were, a tweet from someone like this could be good for business.

Sorry, how is Bitcoin not Fiat money?

"Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value that has been established as money, *often* by government regulation. Fiat money does not have use value, and has value only because a government maintains its value, **or** because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value"

You're right, nickels aren't fiat either, they're made of 5 grams of metal.

That's the blockchain. Ethereum is not fiat, but Bitcoins have no intrinsic value. Like the dollar, the parties engaging in exchange agree on its value.

Reddit is based on a democratic voting system. 
Is it not obvious that the approach taken here could very easily be used by a scammer to rake in moneys if it went viral? Why should anyone put their money into a decision like this.
If you're both new here, I get it. You should probably have mentioned why you know it's 100% legit. You know the person and made an account to help them spread the word.

Dude you're on REDDIT. There's a voting system built in.

But you can see why we would think this was begging for bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:22:56
So you'll use people donating bitcoin to you as votes to decide what people think you should do with the thief?
If only there were an internet community that used some sort of democratic voting system to help you suss this out.
