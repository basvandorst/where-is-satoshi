This is nothing compared to what will happen if joe public in China starts investing in Bitcoin.  Having seen close hand the Chinese stock market bubbles in the last few years, and how they play out with the man/woman on the street....  Ever seen a granny selling fruit from a cart with one hand and trading options on a laptop hooked up to a smartphone on the other?  Unbelievable.  There will be 200 million grannies gambling with bitcoin daily if it forms a China bubble.  Then: moon.

I'll ask elsewhere.  I chose this name as 'Donald Trump' was taken and this is less divisive.

That's fair enough.  Investing in stocks is a little strange at the moment because if the effects of so much Quantative Easing (or money printing) on the US economy.  But I guess so long as you are not investing anything you aren't 100% comfortable losing, starting off with bitcoin and then picking up the others later is fine.... but it's your decision, and make sure you do your due diligence.

Ask the customer service operators at Bet365.com about bitcoin.  Phone only, no writing.

Whatever you are investing in, remember that it is easy to save money than to make it.  Have cheap taste in clothes and entertainment, and take up hobbies that don't require constantly buying things (such as collectible card games).  Bitcoin is a good choice for investment, but only as part of a portfolio balanced against other non-crypto assets, due to it's volatility.  Thinking about investment at age 16 is a good start, well done. Don't borrow money, and don't trust banks.  Credit cards are legalised slavery.  Good luck!

Good advice

Upvoted for truth.  Also distrust and cross-check the advice of people with more regular usernames as well.  When the wolves come for you, they will wear sheep's clothing.
