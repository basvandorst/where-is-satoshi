I've only been at this for about two weeks. I did a panic buy at what now looks like a great price. I took what appears to be some bad advice - and shorted at 6400. I'm not really concerned about what I lost not climbing to the top with it, but I'm wondering - is hoping for a true market correction futile ? Isn't big money already so involved the 'correction' will be a $7000 buy in per bitcoin ?
I've learned my lesson, and will probably be forced into nothing but alts. But I have to say that this truly sucks for someone who decided to jump on, tried to learn about the technology,  and attempted follow what should have been solid market advice. It is almost as if big money wants to make sure they keep it to themselves. Blockchain may be a great idea, but greed has also been integral in the dislike of capitalism and/or paper money. 
I believe being rich only happens when everyone around you is also. Being wealthy is another matter entirely. At only 21 million coins, and just a few holding them, it will be lonely at the top.

I just 'woke up' and invested after that last bump. I'm glad for those who have kept the faith - and and am confident that you will benefit greatly.  However, because I live where we are paid slave wages and have a family, I can't just dump a load into this.  
I've been studying blockchain and gone from knowing absolutely nothing about it to learning about other altcoins and trading. Honestly though, I am beginning to feel like I'm too late. Bitcoin is the only coin providing a return (aside from day trading),  I'm not whining. Just like anybody else, I realize you have to be in it to win it, but geez.. this is getting frustrating. Its like being called to come get on the bus and having to run beside it instead of it slowing down enough for us to get on.
