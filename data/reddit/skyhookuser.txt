"Rejoin the herd"...how ironically appropriate.

Watching people who obviously have no background in finance speak with such authority about things they don't understand makes going through these subreddits slightly infuriating at times.

Bitcoin has gone to an incredibly dark place the last couple years. There used to be substance and intellectual debate by knowledgeable adults. Now it's just memes and sophomoric posts like these.

The fact that this is news worthy at all shows you there's a problem.

As someone who is currently backing up the truck to load up on Bitcoin Cash, I'm reading this thread with a huge smile on my face.

Scaling, in my view, will eventually be made feasible through the utilization of multiple methods of attack, including L2 when it is eventually live. However, In the meantime, to completely hamstring the entire bitcoin ecosystem because vested interests of the L2 channels refuse to implement the easiest, fastest, and most sensible form of scaling that's currently available to us (modest block size increase) is extremely detrimental to the adoption of Bitcoin. This can be observed with the multiple posts recently complaining, rightfully so, of the outrageous fees. This is the not the Bitcoin that many of us knew before these interests began to push their business model on bitcoin.

It would seem the simpler solution would be to just use a coin that doesn't intentionally limit its use cases simply so that certain vested interests can sell you their "solution." 
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:27:46
The simple answer is Blockstream won't be able to execute their business plan of L2 solutions if bigger blocks makes L2 unnecessary.

Wholesale discounting of every other coin for concerns that Bitcoin itself shares suggests there's a heavy bias at play here. Further, diversification (in the financial world) is considered the only true "free lunch" that exists. To have so much blind faith in one coin that you speak of diversification as if it were somehow a passing fad shows a lack of understanding in the fundamentals of investing. 
There is simply no way there will be "one coin to rule them all" when there are so many different functions and niches that they fulfill. I'd recommend stepping back and analyzing how your views on this have been shaped. My guess is you have probably become emotionally involved and it is affecting your judgement. This is a common mistake in the investment world.

Blockstream currently has $76 million in funding from a few different VC firms. Their notable product currently in the pipeline is called "Liquid." To think their actions over recent years of rejecting any and all ideas that do not align with their interests while pushing their own at all costs is simply a pursuit of charitable passion is incredibly naive.

When you can't win with logic, just be loud and insulting. Good strategy

I appreciate your willingness to learn and admit the possibility of mistakes. Sorry if my explanation isn't the best. However, I think the other commenters' explanations are pretty good and may make it a little more clear. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:09:25
An incredibly well thought-out and reasoned argument. I will have to reconsider my position.

Small blocks create high fees that force people to use layer 2 solutions which is Blockstream's planned revenue source. Bigger blocks destroys this business plan. Obviously, they can't come out and say this so they come up with a lot of ridiculous excuses as to why sensible block size increases will somehow destroy bitcoin.

Your understanding of market cap dynamics is incorrect. It does not increase in a linear, 1:1 fashion with new funds added to the market as suggested in your post. It's simply the last executed trade price multiplied by the number of outstanding coins. If market demand instantly increased due to something like WW3 for example, the market cap would instantly be increased upon the first transaction of the higher price. Market cap can jump independently from the quantity of new funds being introduced to the market.

The concerns outlined in this post are basically why the alt coin market boomed recently. Bitcoin market cap went from over 90% of the total market to under 50% when people realized that the stagnation towards scaling basically made Bitcoin unusable in a large portion of use cases. There are far too many hungry alternatives nipping on BTC's heels that do not have $5 fees. The network effect advantage will only last so long and Core/Blockstream is burning through it quite quickly.

I'm actually underweight BTC right now. The manner in which it is being subverted into a settlement layer has made me very hesitant about its prospects . I've diversified into other coins with less friction and better usability because of this.

Coconuts = Gold
Seashells = Fiat currency (e.g. USD)
Bananas = Treasury Bonds?

Basically this is just saying that BitPay plans to follow the SW2x fork like they and most of the other big players in the bitcoin ecosystem agreed to so that bitcoin can finally get out of the stagnation that caused it to massively lose market share.

Yeah, and I was pointing out why he/she was wrong. The ability to use wealth to increase influence is one of the largest critiques of capitalism, not socialism.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:50:05
Using money (aka capital) to gain power is one of the primary flaws of capitalism. You have your ideologies mixed up. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:47:55
The most obvious indication that this is wrong is the fact it starts out explicitly saying "we are starting a capitalist society"
