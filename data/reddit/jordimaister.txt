That 15% is not a fee is called taxes. Are you unfamiliar with that term?
Can you name any disadvantages ?

Do not confuse **value** and **price**.
So, are bitcoins insecure? Why should it be more secure?

I decide not to buy because I have the freedom to decide.
Yes, it went from 1 to 1000 to 700. So, what about getting your salary in BTC? One month you get 3BTC-&gt; $3000, next month you get 3BTC -&gt; $2100.
And, what about that all bitcoins are created, there will not be any fairness.
The micropayments where invented long long time ago, it is called "pay with cents".

With a bank account, there are no fees. I have good understanding of how money works. And you? Besides Bitcoin, what other money do you know?

I do not mean that it will go away. It just has a great volatility.
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:30:31
