That's not an exact comparison. The botnet is only 5000 machine large and this doesn't mean there are always 5000 machines connected and using 100% of their GPU/CPU power with bitcoin mining.

Wrong.I am reading every word being posted.
@_date: 2012-09-08 19:24:00
I don't think i'm harming anyone directly.

They run on some of the biggest pools, that's all i know. I didn't write these programs, i've bought them.
@_date: 2012-09-08 17:12:50
The guys that sold me this botnet told me i can upgrade it. should i do it immediately ?
@_date: 2012-09-08 19:21:14
I'm not in possession of such details. The zombies are configured to transfer the mined coins to a given address, i have a client where i can see how many zombies are online and change my bitcoin address at anytime. I was told that this botnet cannot do much more than mining for bitcoin, but it can be upgraded.

Good point

Well,i guess then, the answer for you is that it's not ethical to run hacking operations whatsoever. That's an obvious fact, nevertheless, i would argument that i do not carry on any kind of other malicious activity on said botnet, only bitcoin mining. I will now update the main post to add this information, as it makes a relevant part of the question. Thank you

what kind of proof do you need?
@_date: 2012-09-08 16:16:27
I have purchased this botnet, it is specifically designed for bitcoin mining. 
@_date: 2012-09-09 01:24:09
By keeping this attitude you'll never catch an opportunity in your life
@_date: 2012-09-08 15:41:28
The botnet comprises about 5000 machines . They run pooled.
**EDIT** : mining only runs when the computer is idle.
@_date: 2012-09-08 15:26:26
Won't reveal this kind of info, sorry. Yes, it's about 40 GHash/sec. It's a GPU/CPU mixed botnets, it targets mostly gamers and teenagers so they most likely have a gpu on their machine.

Good point
@_date: 2012-09-08 15:54:17
Well the mining runs only when the machine is idle.
@_date: 2012-09-08 15:36:59
You are right about power, but i do not think that this could influence their result, they might be getting less performance, not altered data.

You betcha.
@_date: 2012-09-08 16:54:23
No i don't. 
@_date: 2012-09-08 16:47:09
i have paid 500 btc, investment recouped by the first month.
Last ***3 months*** statistics :

@_date: 2012-09-09 01:28:07
I don't see how this equates to killing anyone.
@_date: 2012-09-08 17:02:52
After reading your reasoning, i'm considering a business model out of this.
@_date: 2012-09-09 01:27:31
The botnet has been sold. Thank you
@_date: 2012-09-08 16:03:11
windows  only
@_date: 2012-09-08 19:33:10
Hey,i'm just trying to gauge attention, in case i want to offload this botnet. You screem scam too easily, anyway, it's good. Trust no one.
@_date: 2012-09-08 16:17:50
I could buy more botnets if available and scale up, don't forget that the botnet provides already over 40 Ghash/sec.
