If it's meticulously crafted, turned in 3 months late, written in C+ despite the outline specifically stating it needed to be in python, and doesn't fucking work to save its life... it was written by my friend Mark.

I guess the questions are: does it really have to be that big? And, how would the attacker know that the wallet is on the minecraft server? Even if you were already monitoring the network, the data itself wouldn't key you into the idea that the minecraft server has anything to do with the bitcoin wallet. Even if you completely owned their network, it wouldn't cross most people's minds to go into the minecraft server and run it. However, if it did get to that point, the lava would do nothing.

Right, but what makes you think someone is going to see the QR code? I don't think that OP was implying that he actually put this on a *public* server. If he did, then I agree, that's stupid.  
My assumption was that he has a privately hosted Minecraft server which he has to log into to scan the QR code. Which, at that point, why even obscure the private key other than to avoid accidentally scanning it?

I'm looking forward to jumping on my trading group discord tomorrow morning and saying "hey guys, been out for a couple days. What'd I miss?" and watching people lose their shit.

This was my first one with any serious money in the market. Fun ride. I was working all day and didn't have time to pull out. Net gain: $0. Could be worse.
