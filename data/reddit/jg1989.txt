How do you figure? We expected btc to tank and that money to go back into alts, now btc is mooning

I'm so confused by this whole thing. I have some btc, and I have some btc cash. I tried to be objective and see both sides but I genuinely have no idea how this is gonna play out, so I'm holding both. Sitting back with a beer and watching.

I hope not! Maybe after btc stops surging? At this rate who knows what's gonna happen lol

If you can't afford to lose the whole 4k, then you shouldn't have invested the whole 4k. This game is for people who can weather the storm. Nobody knows what's going to happen today, tomorrow, or any day after that. We invest because we believe that at some point in the future, the value will be much higher than it is today. Who cares if China bans crypto? Crypto isn't controlled by one nation, that was the whole idea. Tbh, we're better off without someone crying wolf and trying to regulate all the time. It may dip in the short term, but I'm holding my coins for a minimum of 5 years and I'm positive that this roller coaster will hardly be visible on the chart at that point.

Very normal. 5k is a psychological barrier. People expected it to fall back once it approached, so they set sell orders around 4900-4950. Once the sells outweighed the buys, the price started to drop. Once it started to drop, people panicked and sold theirs too. Some will try and time it to rebuy lower, and others will just wait for a lower price to add to their stacks. Either way, eventually the price will get lucrative for the buys to outweigh the sells once again and then it's back off to the races to test a new all time high. The market moves in cycles.
TL;DR  it's normal
