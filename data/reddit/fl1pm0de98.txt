Count me in the minority but I️ think this line of thought makes no sense.  I️ own bitcoin because I️ think it is massively undervalued.  As the public realizes the same - which they have every right to do - it is going to appreciate quickly.  And because it is not fully understood it is going to be volatile.  Any time I️ hear that bitcoin should appreciate slowly and linearly I️ just assume it is because the holder cannot handle the anxiety

So the fear would be somebody gets a decent sized bitcoin position (say 1k coins).  Then sells 10x the amount of futures.  Then on settlement day of the futures contract they smash the market by selling their 1k length and what they lose on those coins they make up 10x on their short.
My counter point to that fear is that whoever bought the futures isn’t going to sit idle and let the price get drilled on settlement, they will defend as they’re equally as economically motivated as the seller to do so.
Oh one other note - using physical position to influence a levered paper position is not legal - there are regulatory bodies who watch for that (cftc)

I’m going to submit this post for the nobel prize in economics

They need cme margin accounts with enough funds to cover said margin (can’t imagine margin requirements will be cheap for bitcoin - that’s actually pretty important question).
They also need leverage.  That means more margin.  That also means there are massively incentivized bulls who took the other side of the shorts and will defend their positions when it comes to settlement.  
It actually occurs to me that it will be way easier to defend a long position than a short position.  Usually a constraint of a futures market is taking delivery and handling said product.  Ie you can’t easily squeeze oil futures at settlement by buying endlessly because you have nowhere to actually put the oil (there’s only so much storage).  Bitcoin you can buy as much as you want without any delivery constraints.

Yea a bit worried about this - that a lot of the recent run up has been front running the futures market.  Think a lot of the expectation of incoming institutional money is built in and will be looking to dump when futures launch

I understand fine how to short.  You do understand any time somebody shorts a future, somebody else is buying it?  And I don’t think that length will be passive at the front end of the market.

If it makes you feel any better - futures are a zero sum game - for every long there is a short.  So there will be just as much size interested in seeing the price go up

Yea I guess I don’t view that as manipulation - that’s just market making - nothing wrong with that.  You’re entitled to have a price you’re willing to buy and a price you’re willing to sell.  Manipulation (in my opinion) is doing something that isn’t economic on its own (ie selling below where you really want to buy to trick market into giving you more volume) or trying to set price at a level (for whatever reason) that isn’t market.

Or is it a bear trap that you’re about to fall into ?!
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:02:35
Honestly I think a lot of these fears of manipulation are completely unfounded.  Can you please elaborate what you think the malicious actor is attempting to accomplish and how?

Wow so sad thanks for sharing.  Speaking from my own experience - the emotional toll of trading can be so brutal - whether a bad call or a missed opportunity.  I have to be in good headspace to handle.  
Very sorry for your loss.

Bro definitely sell part of your position, cmon.  I’m as bullish bitcoin as they come, but denying there’s not a bear case is just kidding yourself.  Why leave yourself 100 pct exposed to that?  The upside is not worth the guaranteed improved quality of life by selling some.  Let me ask you this - if you had no bitcoin and I gave you a million dollars - what percent would you invest in bitcoin ?  There’s your answer on what you should hold 
Congrats on the strong hold to this point!!

Dumb question - but how does that cross-exchange discrepancy not get arb-ed out?  What stops me from selling on bithumb and buying on gdax?

What does that mean not healthy?
