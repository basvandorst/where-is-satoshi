1) No but I have experience in some smaller businesses. Mostly yard work/landscaping, but I'm interested in bc and I have tought myself a great deal
2) I actually do have some experience. I do graphic design and I've had many clients come from my social media page, website, etc. I haven't been as motivated lately so the website hasn't been renewed but the expertise is there.
3) I bring experience in website design, customer relations, knowledge of bitcoin, and much more. I'm looking for someone who wants to help me more on the insurance side. I have a general knowledge and feel comfortable with making an insurance endeavor but if I had someone to back me up and provide some extra knowledge that would be great. I'm also looking for people who would just be willing to give me some startup money in exchange for a share in my company.

I honestly think that any attention is good attention with Bitcoin. People who don't want it won't buy it but it spreads the message to people who are interested. It's kinda like how Donald Trump rose to fame. It's all in the art of the deal.

I like Coinbase but I'm not really sure whether its percentage is higher. Pretty sure it's at about 3-5% but I think it's a lot simpler than most other sites. I don't think you're going to get much lower than 1% without digging pretty deep on the internet.

It's honestly hard to say at the moment. It looks like a bubble is forming but the question is whether people will realize it or not...

I guess he's right. Just not really humble...

The bitcoin website shows a whole list of places where you can buy bitcoin along with their statistics and rates and other useful info. However I use Coinbase because it's easy and simple in my opinion and the fees aren't high. I'm not 100% sure if it works in Mexico but you could give it a shot. If it doesn't work reply in this thread and I'll try to help you out.
