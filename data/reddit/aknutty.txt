I think that is the point of tipping on reddit. Someone random gives you something you don't know about and don't understand and is worth something. I am staring to grasp it, have a bitcoin or so, am looking into other alt coins, but that's the thing this is brand new to everyone! Bitcoin might be the next Google but it also might be the next Altavista with Google on the way but unknown yet. But what we do know is that the underlying idea is truly the real deal, even if this isn't THE one. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:48:33
So to buy a car I have to first buy 2 times the value in bitcoins so when the price doubles in a week I atleast have what I originally paid. That's idiotic. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 21:02:04

Shit no I missed that. How do you get it, I don't know what the test net 
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:12:55
Well I think it's probably better it already happened before they open then a couple weeks after. This makes people wary of btc (which they are anyways) but if it had dropped after adoption there could have been a lot of people who would have abandoned btc

@_date: 2014-10-24 23:53:31
Yes so to buy anything with bitcoin you recommend buying 2 times the amount it costs so you still have bitcoin.

How does that work? If i buy a car with bitcoin then my currency is gone, to get back the bitcoin I need to buy or earn more. Meanwhile the coins I had could have bought me two cars. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:21:42
The real big news will be when dell then takes those coins and pays there employees and manufacturers with them making the circle complete.

Perfect comment for this video while still being unrelated to the content. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 22:39:03
What? If you were a large miner, say in China, and you could generate bitcoin for way cheaper your incentive to sell to cover costs lowers. About every ten minutes 12.5 bitcoins of value has to enter the market to just be stable, if you could mine coins, cover your cost , lock down an acceptable profit And hold bitcoin, how do you lose?
@_date: 2017-01-23 16:35:26
Sounds like you could make a pretty decent profit with out much competition then.

Not trying to be on one side or the other but if you pay a tx fee how can it be spam? If it's zero it will just wait in the meme pool, right? Same with very small tx fees. If it's a regular fee then go ahead and pay the miners right?

I think the emergence of a decentralized exchange that has volumes at or above the other exchanges would pretty much neuter any power that "banning" would bring

It was on their own time. No one gets paid to stand for the national anthem, they can be stretching, or reading a play book, calling their mom or taking a shit. Not one penny of difference in their paycheck. They get paid to play football which they all did. General Kelly can believe and say whatever he wants, that's his right, and so is what those football players did.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:49:54
Also it will probably curb the volitility as all these major players will be trading against each other.

Although this is a use case that is taboo this is one of the greatest things about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 00:01:01
Would this really hurt the markets or just more of the US budget. I mean they already have pretty considerable resources and there are still tons of markets and very little seizures 
@_date: 2015-03-12 15:41:46
I've done something like this and it's actually pretty easy to both remember and to make impossibly huge. I had a small phrase and a number pattern then add the same again but all caps on the phrase then again but with the numbers written out then again with caps and the number written put. My password was pretty simple to remember but was like 60+characters long. If you throw in special characters in between that makes it even more secure. You can also keep adding complexity without really making it harder to remember.

Could it be that anyone with bitcoin is basically on a fixed (btc) income, or more accurately a fixed wealth, dependent on price, which is way below most average buy price. The VAST majority of btc is held for $10k or more. The deflationary side of bitcoin is catching up. You can't centralize the expansion of an currency while simultaneously asking small holders to spend. Why would I buy anything for a couple $100 if I think in a couple years I could buy an island with the same btc. Answer: they won't. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 14:44:24
How would you convert the numbers and suits into her? 
@_date: 2015-02-25 07:55:34
I literally cannot tell if you are serious or not? Holding/hoarding is good? Capital movement and investment is bad? Or are you bullshitting me. This is a huge problem for bitcoin and is so incoherent sometimes that I don't know your intentions?

You know JP is not a religion, right? You can take what you like and leave what you don't and even if you only take .01% you come away the better. The fact of the matter is the Venn diagram of JP's audience and bitcoins does overlap, possibly considerably, and being how high profile he is, and the real utility he can find in bitcoin can highlight its usefulness to many who would not have known. Censorship resistance is a key if not THE key feature of bitcoin, and this is a good representation of that. Take the win and move on.
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:58:12
So what does that mean as for the security of bitcoin

From my understanding of quantum computers (limited) the encryption would have to be orders of magnitude larger not just double or quadruple. Is that feasible

@_date: 2013-06-24 14:58:36
So with the total cost stated in another comment as 160 plus the cost of miners it would be a positive after about a year right? 
@_date: 2013-07-03 16:09:20
If super computers can't crack the 128 bit encryption in a reasonable amount of time but a quantum computer can do it very quickly, won't quantum computers make bitcoin and most encryption software obsolete? 
@_date: 2013-06-24 19:20:11
Is personal mining just about obsolete soon. I feel like it's almost impossible for a single person to achieve significant mining
