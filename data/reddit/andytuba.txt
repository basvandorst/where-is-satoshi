Alrighty then.
1. Finiteness: I already laid out six steps with a clear start and end point.
1. Definiteness: We could break down my steps further, like "look up exchange rate for user's local currency" contains the implicit tasks of "determine the user's locale" and "look up currency for that locale", but nbd.
1. Input: " btc [in currency]"
1. Output:  btc according to current exchange rate
1. Effectiveness: if I had to do it all manually, it would take a minute or two to look up the exchange rates -- but the rest is feasible using my brain and pen and paper.
I just find it asinine that anyone would say anything related to getting results from a search engine as "not an algorithm".

Why are those benefits useless for bitcoin users? 
It's slightly less secure to store your btc with someone else, but it's more convenient to farm out that out to a specialist than have everyone maintain their own client which will probably be *more* susceptible to hacking.
Credit cards are for when you don't have money or when you want fringe benefits (eg frequent flyer miles). 
Debit cards are for convenience in transferring money, especially if you're dealing with a physical vendor. I don't think that'll change unless it becomes seriously trivial to carry around a bitcoin token of some form. Same argument for checks.
Fraud protection seems like a better way to convince average Joe to use BTC. Does fraud disappear simply because the vendor takes bitcoin?

Yes, Google Goggles is taking a picture and analyzing it for the QR code.  Same thing as QR Droid or ZX Barcode Scanner.
Websites will put QR codes on their page so you can scan from printout or the screen. e.g. AndroidPolice's app reviews add QR codes to link to the app download page, so you can hold your phone up to your computer and quickly open the link on your phone.
Bitcoin QR codes, instead of being links to websites, are the Bitcoin address and (optionally) a request for X coins.

There's still a risk of losing money in an exchange if they're shut down: if the exchange is holding your account balance in "internal" storage instead of as a wallet*, and they cannot/will not release your funds, then you're probably SOL.
\* As I understand it, MtGox tracks your holdings/trades within their system, but doesn't commit anything to a real bitcoin/fiat transaction until you withdraw/deposit.

Well, you know when people read off web addresses like "www dot example dot com *backslash* page"? That feeling is what your backslash evoked in me.
@_date: 2013-05-05 15:47:30
I'm curious. Although I probably don't have the time to implement it, what's your idea?

maybe somebody could prototype it up and then try to sell the IP to a company which already builds electronic parking meter systems.

Really?  How much do you folks carry in your pocket?  'cos I've got max $80 in my (physical) wallet unless I'm at an event where I know I'll need cash and the ATM will charge &gt;$1/transaction.

I can think of a few options.
1. Be wealthy.
1. Do fundraisers targeting some wealthy people (e.g. angel investors)
1. Do fundraisers targeting many middle-class people
1. Ask a bank for a loan

You're supposed to self-report it.  US taxes includes a section for "income which hasn't already been reported". This would include labor for cash, cash tips, etc. 
Although bitcoin is semi-anonymous, a good auditor might track down your gains if you're not super-conscientious about which addresses you use and how you spend your coins.

Whoa, buddy.  You're presuming a lot of backstory here.

Isn't that a breach of contract with your credit card payments company? More discussion on the other reply.

My point is that your example vanity address isn't very vain -- I can barely distinguish the "custom" bit from the rest of the hash.  If I wanted an address that looked like gibberish, I'd just copy-paste one that my bitcoin app auto-generated for me.
In this case, a little formatting might do the trick: **1EATERN1**WfP3W... -- and that fits nicely into OP's [take 2 design]( too.

heh.. I threw in a few bucks earlier, when it was $118 : 1 BTC, via blockchain / zipzap and now I'm wondering 1) when it'll actually get processed and 2) which price I'll get.  (I already got my "money sent" confirmation from zipzap, now I'm just waiting to see the transaction show up on blockchain.)
I really shoulda bought a big chunk of change last week or ... yannow .. six months ago.
EDIT: Speak of the devil.  I just refreshed and ba-dum ching!  money money money.

You can call your bank and all nicely to have them raise your  daily withdrawal limits. It's built into the system, all you have to do is request it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:59:31
You don't explain it, you just offer "subscription funded by Bitcoin!", do all the bitchwork on the backend, and they only need to be concerned about having money in the wallet.

Generally speaking, please don't say "it should be easy to do [a programming task]" unless you're ready and capable to do it yourself. Dunno if you are, but it's one of those bad cultural attitudes which lead to programmers getting ill-used by clients/managers.

If you're curious about what data actually gets sent back and forth, you can right-click &gt; Inspect Element&gt; Network tab, then load up your wallet.   That reveals the network requests going back and forth between your browser and the blockchain.info servers. You can drill down into individual requests and see what data is actually getting sent.

Did you see the news about the new spam filter? It may just need a little training, especially if the links in question only started appearing recently.
Automod wiki config shouldn't really be that hard for banning a list of domains and adding new ones to an existing rule.. are you not using wiki config?

haha brilliant conspiracy theory.
1 BTC currently trades for about $130, but it has traded for anywhere from $60 -- $250 in the last month.

So [how am I supposed to interpret this chart](
@_date: 2013-05-29 01:37:29
I'm seeing it on rMBP with OSX 10.8.2 in Chrome 27 and Safari 6 if I resize the window to under 1200px wide.  I wouldn't call &lt;1200px "smaller"..
looks like it's because you're using .span6 for that container, which is bumped down a smaller size &lt;1200px.  Just float both the buttons right and put a margin-right or margin-left on one of them, don't wrap them up in that .span3.offset3.

yay, it's learning time! it is a shame about hypercorrection.  (I wonder if "to him and I" will ever go away.) i also struggle with whoever/whomever, so lemme talk this out to see if I understand.
OP's title could be rephrased as, "To the person who blah blah'd..." or "To he/she who blah blah..."; hence, by extension, "to whoever who blah blah'd" would be correct, yeah?
but if he had appreciated it as "Somebody sent me a donation. Thanks to whomever!"  would that be correct at all?

It'd be like when countries with interesting TLDs, like .ly and .me, sell off domains to businesses from other countries.
