Almost done for three years, lol.

I wonder if he realizes that his actions are making that more and more likely, and that there are people that will support losing "core" just to get rid of the people like him that are in charge.

Yay, a technology shortcoming means users need to pay more. I'm sure that'll encourage adoption. /s

Bovada is garbage. Good luck trying to deposit "winnings" from them - just did it this week for some super bowl winnings and the fucking check bounced. Now waiting for support to "check it out" after faxing bank statements and a copy of the check I had to pay for. 
Fuck them, never again.

I love how childish this head mod and Peter T make core look. Wonder if they ever think about how this ridiculous behavior makes it look.
Being afraid of discussion is a clear sign they're worried about their "core".

Does anyone know how to delete an alert after creating one? Can't see how to do that anywhere.

How in the world would a fat check influence someone?! /s

RIP mod status
@_date: 2016-01-13 05:23:18
Well obviously HE isn't being censored here so there isn't any!

Phew, good thing Core is so against centralization and lets THREE WHOLE COMPANIES decide the primary chain instead of hash rate or nodes, lmao.
@_date: 2016-01-13 05:12:49
Yeah, and he "still has a great deal of respect for theymos". What a joke this place is.
@_date: 2016-01-13 05:04:19
How is it not your place to say more?
This is completely insane, a subreddit about bitcoin, which is supposed to be about decentralization/freedom from governments/etc is being censored left and right by a single person, with people that disagree from him being virtually taken out back and shot.
How long until the community is completely divided into multiple subs because of the actions of one giant douchebag?
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:34:51
And nobody would be that blatant..oh wait.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:13:53


Yeah, Shrem and Theymos have been nothing but trouble.
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:06:32
Yeah, don't tell them about this post.

You too Blockstreamcoin!

Wow, so brave.

Step 1 - segwit
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:07:22
But...there's no conflict there. /s
@_date: 2016-09-14 22:54:28
This was the first one I thought of as well.

Shhhhhhhhhhh nobody wants the truth here. It's more fun to bash on alts.
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:19:41
Congrats man, that's awesome! No shame in taking the profit like that. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 08:24:08
shhhh working as expected
@_date: 2015-10-07 06:19:31
Wow, I thought this was a satire headline.
