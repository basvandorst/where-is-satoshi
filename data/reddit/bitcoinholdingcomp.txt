So if everyone is trying to get a hold of Bitcoin, but no one is willing to get rid if it, the price collapses? I think you have that backwards.

With over $75 trillion in global M3 money supply which will be replaced with fewer than 21 million Bitcoin, my moon is about $3.5 million (in inflation adjusted dollars).

You trust your lawyer with full, password-unprotected access to your private keys?
What happens if bitcoin goes to the moon, the economy becomes unstable, and some intern at the law firm is trying to find a way to make the rent as he's about to be laid off?

OK, so it's password protected and the password is given to you family members? That sounds like a better scenario. But there is still an issue with you family members being crypto-intelligent enough to properly secure (and not lose) the password. [Relevant.](

I think you should have a simple backup method (2-of-3 plus password protection) for your own backup.
If you want to give your heirs the option of reassembling the key, I think you should make another large-split backup (5 of 6) spread across friends, family, lawyers, safe deposit boxes (which they gain access to when you die), etc.
This prevents any password necessary and requires a grand collusion to screw you over. The big problem I see is that most people don't care about bitcoin or crypto-security... they will probably lose or misplace the keys you entrust to them.
Personally I don't care what happens to my bitcoins when I die. Creating a recovery method is too much of a security risk while I'm alive. I plan on taking my coins to the grave with me.

Don't forget that your mining pool probably has a minimum withdraw amount and a withdraw fee (at least 0.0001 BTC each). So you need to mine at least 0.0002 BTC or all BTC will be stuck with the pool.
You can probably get at least $20 for the computer on eBay or CraigsList. That's 0.05 BTC and you don't have to wait.

I'll agree that anyone buying into bitcoin should know what they are doing, and it's likely that lows of naive people will end up losing money because they don't know what they're doing.
Still doesn't mean any is wrong to call it an investment.

It's a speculative investment. Speculative, but still an investment.

I like your theory, but there are millions of competent entrepreneurs around the world, but not more than a few thousand of them could be early bitcoin investors. Doesn't seem like a big hindrance to growth.

One big problem is that you're tying the value of the notes to the price of bitcoin. So shops are going to have problems marking their prices in the local notes and everyone is going to have to check the exchange price when doing and transactions.

If some government body had control of bitcoin to the extent that they could change the mining algorithm, why wouldn't they just abandon the whole crypto currency idea all together and turn it into some sort of digital-only currency they had complete control of? Why would the government give up control when they could have more?
