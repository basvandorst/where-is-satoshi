you have been mislead by shitcoin shills, you have fallen prey like a shitty investor.
The only argument was that other crypto can handle more traffic than bitcoin but this is bullshit. Eth can't even handle a meme website running on it...what would happen if something like amazon wanted to run on it? lmao
Other than that bitcoin is the most secure and most simple coin. Simplicity insures security, ETH is riddled with bad code and vulnerabilities 95% of other coins run on it.
Coins like monero offer better privacy but are the worst at scaling and since they are private they can't integrate well with other crypto IE BTC and LTC via atomic swaps
Then you by far have the best developers developing for bitcoin...ETH has some good devs but Vitalik is a God figure and can change anything at his will unlike Bitcoin which is decentralized on purpose. Monero does have good devs as well. OMG has good devs but that's just getting way off the path.

Except gold does NOT have intrinsic value like this. If you want we could argue that nothing has intrinsic value and value is only relative to human definition but that's kind of aside from the point. The thing with Gold is that it's not rare it was just chosen to be a symbol of value and it's price is pure speculation just as bitcoin. People maintain this thought because it's the ideology that has been instilled in your head since you were 2 years old.

I too see something that needs a lot of work especially for the common person to use but I also have been around long enough to know that almost all technologies, what I would consider low level at least, start off in a similar fashion and in time evolve. We are still in the mid 90's phase of crypto.

Actually a great anti-example. They were advertising they were carrying it on their person and was also done by people they knew(the guards) proving that even in those circumstances it's not about advertising you own something of value but that it's easy to steal with lower risk of confrontation while doing it. So those who decided to do that had a high degree of certainty they could take the jewelry because they a) knew where it was b) could avoid confrontation. I doubt this guy is walking around with his private keys on him removing any of those characteristics.  
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:58:24
I already did 
Just because a question is unanswered does not give you leeway to say whatever you want, as soon as you want to bring God as a possible answer the burden of proof is not on me to disprove you, that's another fallacy. If you want to claim it's possible that God exist then you must prove why. The scientific method works by proposing a testable problem and through repeated experiment and given a consistent positive outcome you may then verify your proposal. Until you prove your question it is not accepted as a possible solution, it does not work the opposite way that until you disprove something we might as well believe it's possible. 


Furthermore these kinds of statements are extremely dangerous as is the majority of what you say. It's the type of shit that leads credulous people to join cults, hand their savings over to psychics and believe sacrificing babies will provide some supernatural power. None of which is the burden of proof on me to disprove, you should automatically assume these things are false unless there is observable and verifiable evidence.
I am very open minded but saying we must not rule it out is meaningless to me. The idea of god has been around for tens of thousands of years and there isn't a single verifiable piece of evidence that one exist. There are 100s if not thousands of variants of the same creation story all tracing back to sumer. It's much more possible to prove that religion exist, at least in modern form(which is what the major 3 are),  as a tool of mass control and oppression. Yet not one miracle from a religious text can be proven. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:27:15

I can agree to that but I think many stem folks look down on people who campaign for a belief in a flying sky daddy and with good reason. At least in a literal sense, if you believe in goblins and ghouls but want me to trust you in science and math I have to take issue. There is literally no scientific reason to do so even if it's your "hunch".
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:21:18
My saying there is no proof of a God and you saying nothing else for an argument except 


Is absolutely a God of the gaps argument. You expect me to believe that since there is still an unknown that that proves there is the possibility God exist. You can not have your cake and eat it too. The fallacy is that your statement proves nothing except that there is an unanswered question, it does not validate God as a possibility. I have inserted no belief about what fills those gaps either, I don't have an answer and am open to any one that you can provide actual reasoning for but you can't do that. instead you say


then expect me to actually believe that God existing is a real possibility, intellectual dishonesty at it's finest
I can also proclaim xenthendu god of pizza created Earth and use your argument and you must concede we can't rule this out since it can't be disproven. How idiotic would that be though? There is no reason to believe that's the case just as there is no reason to believe God created the universe in  7 days and 7 nights...an idea which is actually scientifically wrong. So while you can say anything is possible the likelihood of it being possible is so insignificant it's essentially 0 and a waste of time to consider and if you want to consider it a possibility then again the burden of proof is on you to explain why and not have the schoolyard attitude that since I can't prove it wrong I have to realistically consider it.


lmao what? You gotta just be trolling at this point or you really don't understand what a strawman is. Firstly I never proclaimed you said anything in reference to religion but God even as a concept would not exist without it. And your inability to say God instead of creator says to me you are moving goal post to blanket the philosophical concept of a God. Let's not forget my response was to a guy who believes in the strictest sense of christianity, so let's not move goal post and pretend my arguments were about anything other than God in Catholic form.
There is much more reason to believe in the possibility of extraterrestrial life than there is God. We exist on a planet of which there are millions of similar planets in the observable universe. That actually is a compelling reason to think there might be life outside of Earth. Just because Earth and we exist does not give a good reason to believe in intelligent design though. You have wrote novels about how we can't discredit God yet have not given one reason why I should actually give it a non 0 chance other than well I've got questions and there aren't answers to them.

Literally stupid. There's absolutely a difference between those who believe in science and creation. One believes in a scientific method where fact is proven by repeated experiment and the other believe in mythology as fact. There is 0 proof for a creator or that we are living in a virtual simulation aside from speculation. To abide by a rule of math and then proclaim god rules is to make you an idiot and untrustworthy at minimum. You don't have to rule out the possibility by all means but to proclaim and live your life by God makes you an idiot.

If the US bans bitcoin it would be the equivalent of the US having banned the internet in the 90's. Crypto is not going a way and if we ban it all that will do is set the stage for every other country to get a leg up in catching up in wealth to the US. The US could create their own for it's financial system but I don't think anyone would care because to every single other country it would be better for it to stay decentralized. Now does this mean they won't still try and ban it? Who knows I wouldn't doubt it with how much US politicians are bought but hopefully they are smart and understand by doing so would be detrimental to it's own economy. Also why it actually is good for financial institutions to get in as soon as possible because that will greatly reduce the likelihood.

how so on a hardware wallet there should be a cypher to enter your seed which mitigates an attacker who has a keylogger installed when you bring a paper wallet online to spend.

First rule is don't put in more than you care to lose. There is no guarantee it will double and you may find a "bear period" where you are in the red 50% of what you put in. With that said Bitcoin will either be worth 0 or a lot a lot more than 10k in 7 years.

I agree I really want to see them succeed and to have more than two options on the market. Will give them some time and hope that shapeshift can double if not triple their resources to fix the problems but unfortunately I can't recommend anyone buy their product over the other options atm.  In fact I'd recommend people avoid them until they can see if they can get their act together. If shapeshift doesn't massively help them with resources their product will die as they will only get bogged down implementing non essential features.

that's still dumb AF. How many rappers you find live streaming their money phones on instagram to only be robbed an hour later? 0. Maybe in Souther America, specifically brazil but not in a first world country. Any person with two bits of sense keeping significant holdings in bitcoin(way over 6 figures) would have multi sig accounts set up and there is no way of easily extracting value from that quickly.

If you were in it to support crypto your actions would consider the healthiest action for it to succeed in the long term and not just the one that lifts your bottom line the most. Switching back and forth on forks is terrible for crypto and in the long run your earnings. You are valuing short term gains over anything else. So at least be honest and don't give bullshit responses like I'm into crypto not bitcoin.

I agree mostly with what you are saying but no other coin is more secure than bitcoin. It's hash power and network + simple implementation prove that. Segwit hopefully solves fungibility issues. Privacy and censorship are issues. There are definitely coins with more privacy and maybe censorship but i'm not convinced of that one and lightning should also help here. Regardless these forks don't address any of those issues and actually make them worse. Not that you brought that up but I think it's important to understand why these forks are bad.

Then you have no idea who security works with crypto. Firstly large blocks decrease the amount of people willing to run nodes which increase the ability to attack the network, secondly shorter block times increase the ability of 51% attacks as you have less time needed to verify so it's quicker to sneak ssay a double spend. Thirdly the network that has the most hash power is more secure as it increases the amount of computational power to do a 51% attack.

um what, im pretty sure stephen paddock financed his heinous crimes with good ol USD. Even after registered 15 million guns in his name with those good ol USDs the US could not prevent his attack. Has the dollar been blamed for this? No and quite frankly transactions in bitcoin are easily monitorable and face much more scrutiny than any transaction done in USD. Had Stephen purchased those guns with bitcoin I would certainly wager the attack would have been prevented.

That's so fucking ironic you say end the FCC yet are supporting this initiative...I guess it's okay that it exist if you agree with what they do eh?
Again though it is not black and white as you make it to be. The internet should be seen as a public utility. Would you also be okay with Walmart investing into street building in your city and only building streets to it's own stores and preventing any roads built elsewhere leaving every mom and pop store as a dirt road?
If you are a freemarket libertarian you should support initiatives that allow for the most competition. When ISPs disallow access to content that is not their own they are stifling the freemarket because there are no alternatives allowed because anyone who dare tries will be tied up in a war of attrition. The reality of this ruling is that it was fuck our economy...I'm all for less regulation but the system needs to be fixed and removing net neutrality has absolutely nothing to do with the freemarket it's just more corporate takeover.

Because Bitcoin is more secure. There are a host of other issues those coins have that Bitcoin does not and anyway there can surely be more than one type of digital store of value.
I personally think coins like monero could be more valuable but those coins face way more issues with things like scaling or atomic swaps because of their anonymous nature which will also be their downfall due to regulation as well unfortunately 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:50:31
People love saying Bitcoin is in a bubble( and yes it could be ) but why, I have yet to hear a great reason other than the price is rising too fast. The answer was surely easy in the housing crash, trash loans were given out willy nilly with no real way to be paid back, the internet crash happened because tons of people put money into companies that didn't actually even exist or didn't actually have a product. But why is bitcoin in a bubble? Now with ICOs that answer is easy if you want to say they are in a bubble but all it takes for bitcoin to be worth anything is for that to be agrees upon with consensus, the money put into is and the price is much more justifiable than almost every other currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:20:24
This isn't a strawman argument it's a *use case* or if you want to call it a misuse case. Something that could easily happen.

I've pondered it myself and I wouldn't estimate that more than a couple tens of thousands of people own more than million+ worth of bitcoin. Maybe 100k at most in the 6 figures. In a city like NYC there are near a million people that probably maintain those types of assets...So I wouldn't say bitcoin has created a new class at all but I think that also shows how much more potential is left for that to actualize.

Running a node is how you get to cast your vote on the network, so setup a core full node and signal you support core.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:13:58
Nodes are essentially the tellers for the network, they verify transactions. Running one helps keep the network decentralized and more robust against attacks on the blockchain

@_date: 2017-11-15 22:45:37
Yep in the long term this is a great move by square if bitcoin stays around. Regardless people will want things like cards or apps to pay for things but makes no sense to store large amounts of value in a third parties hands...in the US we are lucky but ask the people in Greece, Turkey, Venezuela etc. What a company like Square can position itself as is a big player in off-chain transactioning by using their service and they could be an established intermediary that can handle chargebacks, remittances etc. If the posit themselves as the first in that space it could be humongous for them. I have to imagine this is why they want to get their feet wet right now, and it's a great first move to establish themselves in the space yet still pretty low risk.

Your responses show at best you once read an article in the economist and your answers are shallower than a kiddy pool. 


This shows such a weak understanding of what you are even talking about. Do you know what happened after 2008? The Fed invented 4 trillion dollars, do you know where that money went? To wallstreet, it allowed giant corporations to borrow at a low interest rate and put all that money into slightly better performing stocks giving artificial rise and stabilization to the market. The reality is that inflation and cost of living soared to the common person and lined the coffers of the 1% even more so. But I guess we will have to wait for the sequel to the big short for the common person to understand how this has further fucked our economy. Now I don't disagree inflation can be good but again to put some blind faith that the fed is doing what's right or best for the economy beyond idiotic.

lmao the Fed wants inflation because it decreases they amount they owe on their debts. By suiting economic needs that can only mean those of extreme privilege and not the plebs.

Are you stupid or maybe 15? Do you remember 2008? The fed monetizes debt it doesn't *spend* it on the public it buys it from the gov't to capitalize off it the same way the crash in 2008 happened. Sure it's done under the guise of boosting the economy with lower interest rates so people buy more and invest in stocks but it's done artificially and will surely have serious ramifications down the road. Now maybe bitcoin as a deflationary currency isn't perfect but it has succeeded in proving a way to release the stranglehold of a single entity that manipulates the entire world economy. If anything I don't care that anyone believes in bitcoin but starting to realize things like the fed is nothing but a cartel and the current system is deeply flawed is of utmost importance and cryptocurrency is the only real solution working towards making a better financial system...even if its going to take a while to get right.

M neither but not necessarily sure if it's good you never hear about them. I kind of wish they were more outspoken. They have more pull in the industry than anyone but usually remain quiet and cave to regulation while others are much more like activist

if he actually does short the market and his brother does know something it would technically be illegal right. textbook insider trading.

you should be looking at wage growth vs inflation not just one and strangely enough its been the lowest in history since 2009 *gasp*

Blockchain technology won't do shit for banks except offer slightly better efficiency. All a block chain is I'd an ultra secure database, but for them it still won't offer that. To make actual use you need decentralization which banks will never do so thus all it does is provide a new type of database.
