Reddit laps the propaganda up though because everyone loves to hate on the US.

Putin is a great guy, the western media is just out to get him, lol. Jk.

Yeah, any coverage on BTC is probably worth watching but I'm on vacay so I can't catch it.
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:05:36
The only stuff is usually see on it is showing how terrible the US is regarding it's foreign policy while never criticizing Putin blatantly invading Ukraine.   So yeah, if you like hating on the US, it will be captivating.  To get a less biased viewpoint, I would turn to the BBC or something like Immanuel Wallerstein's commentaries.

I'm surprised when I talk to people who still have never heard of it but there are more than you would think.
@_date: 2014-12-17 14:32:54
Maybe it's factual but it is selective in its facts to paint a specific picture which makes it extremely biased.

Wow, that's so weird. I originally saw it the right way but it can be reversed!

So somebody could just make a new program that doesn't have a built-in backdoor accessible by the government but then it would be illegal?  That would be insane to require anyone who writes software to somehow make it accessible by the govt.

Lol, this title pretty much is the epitome of reddit.
@_date: 2016-01-13 01:52:46
Ahh. Thanks for answering.  But still, there wouldn't be anything stopping people (aside from threat of legal consequences) both inside and outside the US from making and using software that does not have the govt. certified cryptography.  Certainly for the general public though, people would be less likely to use Tor if it was illegal.

Okay so they want a backdoor to x, y and z (say imessage, gmail, facebook).  There is nothing stopping from somebody from creating a new technology (new app or whatever) that doesn't have the x, y and z backdoors.  They can't just keep legislating backdoors for technologies as they are created, ya? That's the crazy part of their argument or am I missing something?

Why is the only area in reddit I get spammed like this?
@_date: 2016-02-22 19:43:09
WTH is Poland Ball?
@_date: 2016-02-22 19:56:39
Okay, sounds good, I'm in.
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:10:21
Goddamn, it's out of control!

Man, Girl Scout cookies are a ripoff @ $5 these days.  The only reason they can make sales is sympathy.
@_date: 2015-10-28 03:46:00
Haha.  I was telling my friend he should sell at around 7/800.  I think he actually did with some of it.
@_date: 2015-11-17 02:18:46
Kanye coin or whatever it was called.  Edit: Coinye! Lol

It's pretty funny how behind the times academics can be.  It was a long time ago but I remember a professor trying to tell the class about google, lulz.

At least the case is titled "The United States of America v Ross U." instead of The People v. him.
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:15:21
Haha, thanks for the insight.
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:14:05
Interesting point but you must see the difference between FedEx shipping stuff with unknown contents v. a website where you can browse and purchase illegal drugs.
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:34:49
Lol!  Freedom is priceless.
