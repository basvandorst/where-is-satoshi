"Transaction" should be "Miners" or "Mining" on the bitcoin side

Just in case anyone else wanted to get their creative skills going this weekend, here's a website that claims to have another 650 WU advertising flyers

You're thinking in the wrong paradigm...

Well actually, this is possible. Read the white paper instead of judging it. 
There's an example about a TV negotiating with a washing machine to delay the washing cycle for the benefit of cost savings for the householder.
Pretty basic scenario yes, but what happens when all the other 'smart' devices start negotiating utilising autonomous rules set out in a smart contract?

This took me a bit to figure out. The ethereum blockchain is the blockchain running the smart contracts inside of the ADEPT software stack. 
So instead of them duplicating the ethereum block chain, they use the ethereum blockchain under the hood (possibly the wrong term here), and reap the benefits of a blockchain mined for more than just the cause of keeping an IBM blockchain secure...
So really, if you mine ethereum, you follow through to keep IBM secure, because the blockchain they're dependent on is the ethereum one.
