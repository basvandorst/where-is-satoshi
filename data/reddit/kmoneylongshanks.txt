We weren't expecting this post to get to the front page of Reddit. We are just looking for people to help develop the protocol at this time. There's no reason for anyone who isn't working on this project to care about it any time soon.

The headline was created to create the most amount of attention possible, which would help us find the developers we need.  
  
There is definitely room for competition when it comes to the percentage of ad revenue that certain websites share with their publishers/artists.  
  
And with that I need to eat something before I go into a diabetic coma.

Correct. The demand comes from the various services offered to Bitcloud users. You have to use cloudcoins to purchase ad space on WeTube (the YouTube DAC), cloud storage on the Dropbox DAC, access to the meshnet when we get to that point, etc. We're aware of the need for the economics to be developed in a certain manner.

The nontechnical paper in the OP is an ELI5.
@_date: 2014-01-11 07:52:14
Bitcoin 2.0 isn't a reference to the actual version number of the client. It's a name for all of the new features being built on top of the Bit coin protocol.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:12:56
We need a "mining" process (proof of bandwidth) to create a currency (cloudcoins). It's about giving people incentives to use Bitcloud.  
  
Edit: Also, we're a distributed autonomous corporation. Read about those here: 
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:18:10
We understand how difficult it will be to make this happen. That's why we are letting everyone develop and contribute rather than working on it by ourselves.

The nodes earn money by hosting content or routing traffic. It's free for users. Perhaps I misunderstood your original question? The reason that other mesh net projects and various decentralization efforts haven't made much progress is because people joining the network (to boil the ocean) have no incentive to do so. Monetizing the projects creates the profit motive (the most powerful motive of all).
@_date: 2014-01-16 21:45:53
Mini Internets can still be connected together with cables. Whoever builds the infrastructure between the New York City and Boston meshnets stands to make a lot of money for routing all that traffic.
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:36:06
Please continue.

I've thought about this as well. I think Bitvoting or whatever you want to call it could work for seasteading, but it is unlikely to work inside borders where another government is still operating. People could choose to opt out of their local/federal governments and start operating under BitLaw, but that doesn't stop the old government from throwing you in jail when their laws aren't being followed.

The technical paper is being written by Javier. [See here]( We need help writing all of the different technical aspects of the protocol, which is one of the reasons for this post. We'd be happy to have you on board if you want to help. We are on IRC freenode 
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:58:20
Another reason it wasn't included in the article. It's been open source for less than two weeks, and only a handful of Java developers are able to see the whole thing. I no longer thing NXT is a scam, but I still need to see more transparency from them.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:10:38
You can call me an idea guy, but Javier has actually been writing the protocol.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:17:59
We've been debating the proper method for implementing these kinds of services. In one scenario, the coins would be destroyed when they are used to gain access to the meshnet (similar to namecoins being destroyed to purchase a .bit domain). Other scenarios would simply pass the coins along to nodes as the packet goes along the network. It's important to remember that we have to build the basic protocol of Bitcloud before we can build the meshnet.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:18:23
I will cross post this over there. We definitely want to work with anyone who will be able to help!
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:48:48
If you have free Internet, I'd like to sign up with your ISP.  
  
We are starting out with WeTube, Cloud Storage, other apps on top of Bitcloud protocol. We will only be able to focus on the meshnet after that.  
  
I'm not a developer. I've just been giving Javier my two cents and kicking around ideas with him. I'm handling marketing, the website, twitter, blog, etc. Javier is the genius behind the idea. He's setting up a Reddit account right now because there are too many questions for me to answer on my own. You can find our contact info at the bottom of the nontechnical paper.

The profit incentive already includes disk space. If someone does not have the bandwidth and disk space to "mine" cloudcoins profitably, then they will be priced out of mining. Same concept applies to Bitcoin.  
  
Bitcloud is software. We understand that there can be bad actors, but the good for humanity outweighs the bad (in our opinions). Just like with TOR and other privacy-enhancing pieces of software.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:42:02
It can be used for that. WeTube was the idea that spawned Bitcloud.

They are basically all different ways of going after the same thing, which is using the blockchain for more than just payments. Some features will be implemented directly into Bitcoin, while other features will be implemented into different altcoins. The "Bitcoin 2.0" features of some alt coins are the first time that we've seen a cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin actually have something of serious value. The thing I've been thinking about recently is that the developers working on Mastercoin and other alt coins have a bigger incentive to work hard on new features than Bitcoin developers because many early Bitcoin adopters have already made their millions.

There are an endless number of problems to deal with in creating the protocol. Thank you for the radio show offer, but we don't think searching for media coverage right now is a good move.

Because eventually, Bitcloud will be the Internet connection. Look into mesh networking.
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:52:33
I agree, P2P broadcasts are only viable options in crowded cities. The Mesh would definitely be more centralized in rural areas, but you would still have many different nodes working to provide access to the Bitcloud mesh rather than 1 or 2 centralized ISPs. People are already working on solutions to meshnets in rural areas for political/idealogical reasons. We are now also giving them a profit incentive to bootstrap a new meshnet. Greed is the most powerful incentive of all.

Open Transactions does what Ripple can do and more without the use of a new, centralized currency. I didn't see a reason to include it.

That's the plan. Different groups are going to have to work on different aspects of the protocol.

We are aware of The Pirate Bay's upgrades for the PirateBrowser. We don't know the technical details of their project, so we're not sure if they're similar. I know they are thinking of a new DNS system with perhaps some P2P servers hosting websites. We are putting everything out there with our project and allowing it to be developed in the open.
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:01:26
Nodes earn money by sharing bandwidth (mining). Early holders of cloudcoins will also notice the value of their holdings increase as the network becomes popular. Bitcloud is a DAC. Read more here:

We're not really working on marketing, we just wanted to let people know that this idea is currently being worked on. Now that the word is out there, hopefully the right people will come our way, including mathematicians.

That's what the nontechnical paper in OP is supposed to be.
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:15:37
We've been trying to get help through less public channels, but most people just say "that's cool" and then leave. We wanted to really get to work on this, so we figured this would be a good option. Everyone can build on top of Bitcloud once it is finished, so we are fine with everyone adding what they want after the base is finished.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:34:31
As of right now, the developers for Bitcloud get paid the same way Satoshi was paid for created Bitcoin. We may take donations to pay developers in the future, if necessary. You can find our names/contact info at the bottom of the nontechnical paper.

Altcoins are only useless when they copy Bitcoin. I wouldn't call creating decentralized versions of YouTube, Dropbox, and other cloud-based services useless. Not to mention the possibility of replacing the entire Internet.

@_date: 2014-01-16 16:55:59
We've been trying to attract developers through avenues that are less public, but most of them haven't stuck around for the long haul. We are trying to bring together many different people to solve the problems that you're talking about. These problems cannot be solved by a small team.

Nodes would have to be more centralized in rural areas, unless wireless tech is improved to the point where mesh networks can be made from devices over longer distances. It's important to point out that an entreprenuer would have an incentive to bring the meshnet to his small city because he would get paid for all of that traffic. Other people could then come in to take a piece of the pie.

If the data was stored in the unmoderated layer, they wouldn't know where the data was stored. They wouldn't have anyone to send a letter to.

You would be paying for access to the mesh network from nodes, just like you pay your ISP for access to the Internet.
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:50:24
There are two different levels. Moderated and unmoderated. Moderators control what will be allowed on the nodes. They can force users to encrypto files locally before sending them to the nodes. Unmoderated nodes receive everything without a filter. The source of the data is anonymized, and the actual data is forcibly encrypted. This is discussed in the paper.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:46:12
Users will be able to watch videos on Bitcloud for free. Advertisers are the ones who will have to pay for ad space, preferential treatment, perks, etc. YouTube isn't really free. It's subsidized for the users with ads.  
  
We want to code this in Lisp, but we understand that not many other people are going to agree with that.

@_date: 2014-01-16 21:35:00
We want scrutiny. We want people to bring their own ideas to how it should be built. People are definitely also right to scrutinize as much as they want, we don't even have a technical paper written yet, which is why we aren't asking for donations. All we're asking for is help from people who want to build this protocol.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:09:49
We've thought of this, and it is not an everybody gets everything distributed model. Nodes choose moderators to sort out which files they will store.

@_date: 2014-01-16 15:44:26
My thinking is it would be device to device in larger cities, and then we would need infrastructure to go from city to city. Solutions for rural communities would be more difficult. We basically face the same problems as but nodes are more likely to come onto Bitcloud and figure out the solution because they get paid for all the traffic that goes through them.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:25:23
A decentralized YouTube was the idea that spawned Bitcloud. It's mentioned in the nontechnical paper.

Whether inflation is good or bad for an economy doesn't really matter in a debate for currency. The less inflationary money wins out in the end because it's a better store of value.

We are currently kicking around a few different ideas. We want to avoid taking donations if possible. The protoshares method is one option, or just waiting until we launch because developers will be the first miners. This is actually the first debate that we need to solve.
@_date: 2014-01-16 19:07:38
Right. So the government can send notices to individual nodes, but that has nothing to do with the developers of the software.
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:46:16
1) I agree with the part about Mastercoin competiting with Bitcoin, and I wrote as much in the article in the OP.  
  
2) Escrow backed currencies are one experimental aspect of Mastercoin.  
  
3) I agree that the security issues with the protocol were serious, but they have since been fixed. I'm not really worried about bugs or flaws with the implementation right now because they only recently hired their first full-time developers.
  
I'm not sure how this article is supposed to be proof that Mastercoin is a scam. I don't own any mastercoins, but I think it's an interesting method of kickstarting new features on top of Bitcoin with an altcoin. I'd prefer to see these features built directly on top of Bitcoin, but it may take a few altcoins with hungrier developers to get the job done.

It's going to be on the traditional Internet first. We will then want to turn Bitcloud into its own mesh network that pays nodes for routing traffic throughout the network.
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:02:34
The interesting thing about [DACs]( is that they allow the developers to profit from their creations. Having said that, we are still thinking about taking donations in the future. We just didn't want to make a post on Reddit asking everyone for money when we haven't even finished the technical protocol paper.

I reached out to the Mastercoin account on Twitter about their "meshcoin" project, but they didn't respond. I've found it hard to find out whatever it is that they are doing with that. We just decided to go public and let everyone build the project. I understand the arguments against Mastercoin, but I still they think offer a unique way to bootstrap various Bitcoin 2.0 features.

We're still in the very early stages of development. We haven't even come close to finishing the real white paper for the protocol. We think more work needs to be done before we take donations. Donations may not be required if the economic incentives of the [DAC]( are setup in the correct manner.

Users aren't going to interact with Open Transactions. They are going to interact with apps, such as Monetas, built on top of OT. I'm not saying Ripple is a premined scam. I'm saying I think the OT model is a much better option. There's no reason to use XRP when you can go directly from euros to dollars or gold to bitcoins between servers on OT.

If Bitcloud is a success, developers profit because the value of the initial cloudcoins go up in value as more people use the network. The same is true of Bitcoin and bitcoins. I'm a writer/SEO marketer/web designer. I've been discussing the main concepts of Bitcloud and how the economics of the distributed autonomous corporation should work. Javier is the lead developer, so I'll let him tackle that question. He's creating a Reddit account and should be answering questions in this thread soon.

I don't think bitcoin is a bubble over the long term, but it is definitely due for a correction.
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:54:50
The payment system is what gives bitcoin its "intrinsic" value. Merchants accept bitcoin because it increases their profits. I think many of them will even give a discount when people use bitcoin to incentivize a move to the currency (much like what Gyft is already doing with the 3% discount). In the near future, people will be able to get a discount on basically anything they buy with bitcoin. Why would they want to get paid in dollars when everything is 5% cheaper with bitcoin? This is a point I'd like to hear Peter address.

This is a valid point, but I still think some people who would have otherwise put value in bitcoin will now also put value in e-gold currencies on open-transactions. The same could be said for dollars and euros. I'm not saying this is a bitcoin killer, but I think it weakens bitcoins value. I suppose bitcoin will still be the top dog currency in that situation because you can see the "physical" bitcoin in your wallet.

It's definitely taken many of the Austrian economists a bit longer than others when it comes to changing their tune on bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-06-04 12:27:42
I think the flaw in thinking that gold is a better option is that governments around the world will never allow it to be used as money. Even if they did, they would want control over the production of the gold money supply. There is an argument for gold being better than bitcoin when it comes to money, but the problem with that argument is you have to throw out the entirety of human history and the normal actions of politicians for that argument to even take place.

@_date: 2013-04-10 19:57:16
Exactly. The only thing that has changed is the exchanges are messing up and some people realize they don't know what they are doing and ran away.
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:51:20
Correct. But I still think most of the transaction volume is people withdrawing/depositing bitcoin to/from exchanges and exchanges moving money around. Of course, I have no proof for this.
@_date: 2013-03-19 11:49:51
Now its around $55. Wonder what is behind this increase. Worried Europeans?

Your site says you do not charge a fee for selling bitcoin, but you are currently purchasing bitcoin for $3 less than the current price. Is this a lag in your pricing system?

The funny thing is that the problems are on the dollar side of the equation.
@_date: 2013-03-19 16:37:29
I guess we'll find out what's going on when the price drops a bit. The last trade right now is $56.89. It is still much easier to sell bitcoins than it is to buy, so a drop down to the $50ish area or lower might cause people to get out. We'll have to wait and see what happens when the price begins to go back down. People will start to panic and sell, but those of us in it for the long haul will be glad to buy at a certain point.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:18:25
I feel like this is the most correct answer.

The development of layers on top of Mastercoin is incentivized by Mastercoins. Open Transactions does not have this same model based on incentives. The fact that you can invest in Mastercoin makes me think that it will be more successful than Open Transactions over the long term.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:17:00
It could work over the short term, but I think centralized online marketplaces will eventually be replaced by decentralized autonomous corporations. The decentralized marketplace is already one of the stated goals of Mastercoin.

I think he would jump ship if he realized bitcoin was better than gold. The reality is that it takes a lot of research to understand why bitcoin is the greatest invention since the Internet. He's probably picked up bits and pieces over time, but I don't think he's put the entire puzzle together quite yet. I don't blame him because I held the same views earlier this year.
@_date: 2013-05-26 21:02:13
I think Hayek would have allowed the market to choose the money. If bitcoin was chosen by the market, I do not think he would have a problem with it. This is also the view that Jim Rogers holds. Many Austrian economists have been skeptical of bitcoin, but more of them are giving it a second look. Jeffrey Tucker is definitely someone who likes bitcoin, but that's not how he feels now. There are plenty of articles dismissing bitcoin on mises.org, but there are still some Austrians who like bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:35:36
I agree with your points. I was trying to just go after the pain points Peter was making rather than list all the uses of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-31 14:24:22
You are correct. I was referring to the contracts on gold and silver that would exist on open-transactions.
@_date: 2013-07-16 07:06:13
I think this will be solved by something like Coinbase. Coinbase transactions are instant when they are between Coinbase accounts. Merchants could simply accept Coinbase instead of regular old bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:50:35
Bitcoin is not stable because not many people use it as money right now, so it's really a chicken-egg situation. While a slow and steady increase would be nice, it isn't going to happen. There are always going to big rather large corrections in this kind of bull market. Speculators are going to jump in and then get scared when the price goes down a bit.
It's pretty easy for bitcoin to be volatile when the market cap is $1-2 billion, but it will become more stable as more people use it and the market cap grows into the trillions.
Also, when it comes to gold, gold would be less volatile if it were used as currency. Gold was rather stable when it was used as a currency, but it becomes pretty volatile when it is only used for things like jewelry and a store of value, much like other commodities.

You don't have to go to an exchange to buy bitcoin. Bitcoin local, bitcoin otc and the bitcointalk forums are great when you know the right people.

Right, but now you have another choice when you do trust the merchant.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:36:29
It would depend on the store. Consumers would probably want protection when ordering from a random person on eBay, but I wouldn't be worried about buying something off Amazon, Newegg, Walmart, or any other well-known retailer with bitcoin. An escrow service is always going to be needed when you are purchasing something from someone you don't necessarily trust.
@_date: 2013-07-26 00:11:38
...and Open Transactions is better than Ripple.

Nothing has changed and your long term forecast is the same. The only thing that changed is that you can now buy at $150 instead of $250.

I'm not sure if those regulations apply to businesses that are only purchasing bitcoin. I am not sure about the law behind purchasing bitcoins, but I think fastcash4bitcoins.com may have a case here. If you have to be a money transmitter to purchase bitcoin, then anyone who has ever bought a bitcoin is breaking the law.

Bitcoin enthusiasts will love your pizzeria. You also won't have to pay 3% to Visa or MasterCard when they come by. You may want to accept bitcoin and offer a discount to people who decide to use bitcoin. You save on transaction fees when you accept bitcoin, so you may as well try to get more customers to use it.

I'm not a Bitcoin naysayer, but those numbers are pretty worthless. A large amount of the bitcoin transaction volume is people just buying and selling bitcoin on exchanges. We're a long way from competing with Western Union, PayPal, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:27:17
is somewhat interesting to check on a day like today, but I find the technology behind bitcoin (and the technologies being built on top of bitcoin) much more interesting than the price.
Large nationally available banks are still extremely important right now, but their importance could start declining as more and more decentralized technologies continue to replace their basic functions.

The quick growth over the past few weeks makes me think there are a lot of speculators who have jumped on board without really knowing the fundamentals of bitcoin. It can take more than a few weeks to truly understand everything about bitcoin, so I'm not sure if everyone who owns bitcoins is in for the long haul. I would like to see what happens if the price went back down to $105ish. I think that would knock a lot of the speculators out of the equation.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:56:59


  
@_date: 2013-07-20 14:00:37
I agree with your general ideas. There is still a lot of work that needs to be done for more people to even give bitcoin a chance. It definitely needs to be easier to store large amounts of bitcoin securely, and that is coming soon with hardware wallets and paper wallet printers. Coinbase is basically the PayPal of bitcoin, so that takes care of any convenience or delayed payment issues. As more people build on top of bitcoin, it will be easier for the average person to use bitcoin. The way the average person ends up using bitcoin is going to be quite different from how everything looks now. Once the infrastructure is built, the rest of the population will make the change. I have more to say but I'm typing this from my phone.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:51:06
Wrote this up the other day, but I think it applies here.
1) Instant money transfers for free. - Perhaps the most important aspect of bitcoin is that you can instantly send money to anyone in the world for practically nothing. Bitcoin works like cash. When you send some bitcoin to a friend's wallet, there is no third party who is taking a cut of the action. You are sending bitcoin directly from your wallet to your friend's wallet. It's as if you handed your friend a wad of cash through the Internet. 
 
2) Bitcoin lowers the price of everything by 3-5%. - Since you can hand cash to anyone in the world through the Internet, merchants no longer need to worry about transaction fees and chargebacks. In the past, you may have bought something from a store that charges you an extra fee if you decide to pay with a credit card. The reason that some merchants charge that extra fee is that they don't want Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, or anyone else eating into their profits. Since bitcoin is like cash, merchants don't need someone else to be the middle man between their customers and their sales. You can already get a 3% discount at many popular stores, such as Amazon or Burger King, when you purchase a gift card with bitcoin through Gyft. 
 
3) No one can tell you what to do with your money. - Privacy is not important to everyone, but some people don't like the idea of every employee at their bank or certain government employees being able to access their history of transactions at any point in time. Some banks even sell their customers' past transaction histories to retailers. If you don't want to keep your transaction history in the cloud, then bitcoin is your best bet. When you use cash, your bank can't tell you what to do with your money. The same argument applies to bitcoin. If you want to donate money to a controversial cause, such as Wikileaks, then no one will be able to stop you when you use bitcoin. You don't have to ask for your bank's or government's permission before you make a purchase or money transfer when bitcoin is involved. 
 
4) Microtransactions. - Bitcoin makes microtransactions more practical. In addition to the 3% processing fee usually charged by PayPal and credit card companies on transactions, they will also charge a base fee of around $0.30. This means a $1.00 transaction carries a transaction fee of 33%, and the person receiving the transaction would only get $0.67 out of the deal. Sending a few dollars or less to someone else on the Internet doesn't make sense with credit cards, PayPal, or bank accounts, but it makes sense with bitcoin. 
 
5) An instant bank account. - One last thing to consider is that there are roughly six billion people in the world who do not have access to a bank account. Bitcoin instantly turns into a mobile bank account for people in Africa, Asia, and every other part of the world. People in the underdeveloped world can now send payments anywhere in the world instead of only dealing with cash. There's no need for a bank account when you have digital cash.

There are a few features of Mastercoin that include counterparty risk, but it's disingenuous to claim that's all the Mastercoin protocol will be able to do. I'm more interested in the decentralized applications being built on top of Mastercoin more than anything else. Decentralized marketplaces can replace eBay and Amazon with much lower fees for sellers. Decentralized betting can br used to replacr BetFair and all of the online sportsbooks. Pretty much any service available on the internet can be replaced by a decentralized app built on top of Mastercoin.

Bitcoin has intrinsic value: 
A gold backed digital currency is worse than bitcoin for a variety of reasons. The easiest way to dismiss that argument is to point out that Peter has a gold bank in the Caribbean. You can have a debit card attached to a bank account that stores gold. The gold is converted to dollars when you use the debit. The problem is this is more expensive than a fiat bank account and US citizens can't even sign up for it because of regulations in the United States. Centralization is what kills digital gold currencies every time. Look at e-gold and Liberty Reserve.
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:45:27
The reason that his estimate is so low is that he's looking at the wrong market when figuring out bitcoin's impact. At the end of the day, bitcoin isn't really competing with PayPal or Western Union. Sure, these comapnies become obsolete as bitcoin becomes more popular, but the reality is that bitcoin is competing against fiat currency and gold/silver. He should be looking at bitcoin's currency market share rather than the payment system market share. This is where the $500,000 per BTC valuations come into play.
@_date: 2013-06-08 14:48:59
The transaction went through about 5-6 hours after I started it. Added coinbases response to the original post.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:41:43
Yes, and that is why credit card payments are more expensive. I think we are looking at this from two different angles, and maybe I should have made my point more clearly in my original comment. Because you are not giving the credit card info to your bank account to every merchant, you don't have to worry about someone stealing your credit card info. Although this doesn't affect users of credit cards directly, it affects them indirectly. They pay for that consumer protection in the 3% processing fee. If you are talking about consumer protection and not worrying about who has your private key, then yes, credit cards are more secure. If you are talking about not giving your private key to anyone else in the first place, then bitcoin is more secure.

I didn't mean for my comment to be taken that way.

The coins I bought a few days ago on coinbase showed up in my coinbase wallet this morning. I tried to send those coins to another online wallet. The transaction info for that transaction just says "pending". It was sent roughly 2 and a half hours ago.

It is difficult to get bitcoin right now, but here are some things that could change that:
1) More bitcoin ATM's.
2) Services such as ZipZap where you will be able to purchase bitcoin for cash at gas stations and convenience stores.
3) Coinbase getting everything setup correctly for instant bitcoin purchases.
In addition to lowering fees for merchants, bitcoin can also lower prices for customers. There are plenty of stores that offer a 3-5% discount if you pay in bitcoin, and I expect this trend to continue. If you want to get a 3-5% discount on everything you buy, you'll have to use bitcoin.
When it comes to volatility, you have to also remember that, while the price is volatile, it's almost always higher one week later. Volatility will also lessen as adoption continues and general use, rather than price speculation, takesover a larger chunk of the price.
As someone else already mentioned, buying from an untrustworthy merchant is less secure with credit cards because you are basically giving them the private key to your credit card when you buy from them instead of just a bitcoin transaction.
Edit: Forgot to mention that people can also get paid in bitcoin or sell goods or services for bitcoin to get bitcoin. I predict that people will eventually choose to get paid in the currency that gives them a 3-5% discount on everything.
@_date: 2013-07-26 03:10:36
I think it is more likely that not many people entering the pizzeria are even going to know what bitcoin is. They will ask themselves why bitcoin users get a discount, but not in a negative way. Perhaps they will ask the pizzeria owner for an answer, perhaps they will research Bitcoin later that night. Perhaps they will think nothing of it because they think bitcoin is stupid. Either way, they can still pay with dollars if they think the pizzeria owner is the inventor or bitcoin or something like that.
If what you are saying was actually true, then the "Manager's Special" at local grocery stores would not be popular.

The US banks are already putting that together, although it's usually only certain banks working with each other. ( The problem is there are many limitations on these kinds of payment systems. There is also still a three day delay when you are going from one bank to another. Even if all of the big banks were able to get a free transfer system put into place that actually worked for instant bank transfers that could work for everything from online payments to POS systems, they still have the problem of using the inflationary dollar instead of the deflationary bitcoin. What is the system called in Europe? Is it only for members of the same bank? I'm having trouble pulling up any info.

A slow and steady rise is simply not going to happen with bitcoin. Speculators will get in and quickly get scared when the price starts to go down. Corrections are going to happen from time to time with bitcoin, but , in the words of Adam Carolla, this is "perfectly normal, perfectly healthy."
Bitcoin will only become stable when enough people use it. It is pretty easy to have up and down swings when the market cap for bitcoin is between $1-2 billion. It's much harder for a single person or group of people to move the market when the market cap is at $10 trillion.

Posted this in and received this response from "Yep, my mom just translated this for me. Article basically says:
