The diference is that CounterParty uses its own alt coin, which is not attached to bitcoin valuation.
So if your contract stores a balance in XCP it will change over time with the valuation of XCP. So if you deposite an amount of BTC and later retrieve it you may not receive the same value in BTC because of the BTC -&gt; XCP -&gt; BTC conversion.
With RSK that should not happen because of the 2-way peg.

If you are really paranoid you will make several transactions in between exchanges, splitting and joining at least a couple of times. And will only move small amounts. 
Also every operation within an exchange can potentially be traced. Also there can be communication between exchanges. So you should use accounts to belong to different persons.

They have previously stated that the objective is that over time the need for notaries should be removed when the service gains more popularity and the sidechain can be secured by miners.

If there's something I've learned is that people will do nothing if you do not complain enough.
Even if you are claiming something totally fair. Doing nothing is their default policy, lots of people will stop because is more time consuming having to complain frequently.
You should thread legal actions, complain to better business bureau, or consumer protection agencies.

If you do not want to use a third party API then you should process every transaction by yourself. But then you also do not want to download the whole blockchain.
You can listen the network for new blocks and process them. But you will not be able to verify them if you do not have the blockchain.
An alternative will be to use a ligthweight node. You process the whole blockchain, but trim it and keep the a UTXO working set. Perhaps you have a fullnode offline an sync it with your online node, for consistency.
But if it was my call, I'd use a third party service. Like the other recommendations. In the short term is it less expensive than develop a custom node. When your business grown you can invest in develop a custom solution.

commit != work 
You can work the whole day but make no commit. And conversely you can make tons of commits and have no work.
Just let them do their job, they know what they are doing.

There's no word about fees just yet.
My understanding is that fees will be payed only when using smart contracts, like in ethereum when you send a transaction to a contract.
My guess is that if they want the service to succeed, they will not charge additional fees or will charge very low fees. If the fees are too large no one will use the service.

Namecoin destruction of coin was decided to avoid miners from abusing the system. How do you plan to avoid such issue if they begin to get a fee from each transaction?

Well ECDH as stated in RFC 6637 is an implementation of ECIES. It doesn't needs a key exchange, it generates a random ephemeral key. Like ECIES you need access to the public Key. Instead of using the KDF output directly it uses as a KEK, and uses AES as the MAC algorithm.

Solidity is a language implemented above EVM. If Rootstock implements a 100% compatible EVM it should be able to run.
But obviously they can enhance the security, or recommend a better language.

Old news are old news. They have already started to try to get rid of the bank notes last december causing more problems, because they do not have enough new notes yet.

Also the dao was too much hype, and the presented proposals were lackluster. People were expecting zero risk and huge profits. And lots of "investors" have no idead what a blockchain is.

I'd recommend to start for some specific module. Try to understand how some module work, and then go for the next module. In principle understand the behaviour and not the details. For example start how block are validated and added to the blockchain, when you understand that you can take a look at how transactions are validated.

The EVM was reviewed by Sergio himself, but most attack were on the upper layers (The incorrect pricing of certain opcodes was the most serious attack to the EVM). Bad development practices of smart contracts, lack of serious security reviews. Having too much hype means huge presure to deliver on time, but RSK are going the slow but sure.

You can compare with using a credit card, where a payment confirmation with 30 seconds is fine most of the time. I'd say up to 1 minutes is aceptable, more than that is annoying.

The Taxi Worker Union has staged protest and strikes against Uber, blocking streets, punching drivers, etc. They accuse Uber of unfair competition, because here 'for profit transportation' are required by law to have an extra insurance. The current government do not want the strikes, or to engage into another fight with the Worker's Union, they have plenity of them.
