Yes, and it's not a recent thing.  That's why I 
1. Have my seed words for my phone wallet saved somewhere somehow.
2. Move any long term holding bitcoin back into a new securely generated paper wallet when I'm done doing whatever.

Yes, a paper wallet is just a randomly generated public/private key pair that you can (but don't have to) print out.  If you need to send the BTC somewhere you would need to either do it manually as some below have detailed or sweep it into another wallet using the private key.  Afterwards, never use that key pair for anything ever again.

Plus the new address I'm talking about is a new paper wallet address to replace the paper wallet that becomes potentially compromised literally the first time you use it.  I'm beginning to suspect you don't really understand how addresses, wallets (paper, hardware, software bip or otherwise) or transactions even work.

Since they seem to do the same thing with all financial news, I don't think it's some kind of conspiracy or vendetta against Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-31 03:11:16
If you spend out of a paper wallet why on earth would you want any change to go back into it.  I assume you generated the paper wallet addresses offline in a secure way.  Once you spend OR sweep, that private key is potentially floating around.  It's been through your cellphone camera, or it's keyboard, or your phone's clipboard, or your computer's keyboard...  You should NEVER use that address again.  Just make a new paper wallet and send the change to it.  Keeping the same address and using repeatedly also reduces anonymity and increases someone's ability to track activity.

Not sure what you are on about.  Once a private key has been exposed in any way for any purpose that wallet address should NEVER be used for anything again. EVER.

Spending Bitcoin is considered by the IRS the same as selling it as far as cap gains go.

I don't even have 1000s of transactions for 2017 but I'm sure as hell not entering more than one line for Bitcoin gains.  The IRS can look at my save exchange records and my spreadsheet if they really want to see them.  It's not like the bank sends me a 1099i with every days worth of interest or my brokerage lists every dividend payment for every stock.  I get one number from each and that's what I enter.

It says right on the the payment stub how much is interest and how much is principal.

I never said anything about 4% being a lot.  I was saying to never pay the minimum payment on house or any interest carrying debt for that matter.  A more reasonably priced house, like $100000, would allow that.
Any extra paid at any time on a mortgage is immediately taken off of the principal balance and it can be surprising how soon and for how much less total interest a mortgage can be paid off with consistent  overpayments.
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:45:22
Come on $2000 a month is like a $400000 house at 4.5%!!!!

Why would the IRS tax a fee? The taxes on that money is up to the exchange to pay it's their income.

You must not have been on Reddit long enough.  Somebody voices an opinion in opposition of the subs implied consensus = paid shill.  Someone asks a question that someone else doesn't like = paid shill.  Ask about how to pay taxes here = paid shill. How is that not all the evidence you need?

I still don't understand why anyone just holding goes through all this non-free hardware and bip rigamarole when an air gap generated paper wallet can be made for free.  If you don't trust any of the generators it's easy to write your own too.
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:37:17
That said, you do have to handle them a little backwards by adding the fee into how much whatever it is you are buying or moving costs.  That is, you can't just deduct it outright, you add it to your cost basis.  It's more or less the same thing but you don't get the tax benefit until you realize the gain/loss.
