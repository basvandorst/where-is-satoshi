Yes. This two-year is term is 0.99%. Last two-year term was 1.5% and the one before that was 2.19%.
Each switch has taken a year off the length of time needed to repay my mortgage for roughly the same amount of monthly outgoings (all three mortgages have been within £20).  
So my 25 year mortgage became a 22 year mortgage after only 2 years. It then became a 19 year mortgage after another 2 years. I'm expecting it to become a 16 year mortgage when it expires in August. That's 9 years of my mortgage done in 6 years.
I pay around £500 per month. Of that money, about £125 is interest. Once out of the introductory period, my payments would rise to around £750 and about £400 of that would be interest.... £400 per month!!
That's why switching every time your mortgage expires is so important. Keep your interest rate as low as possible, even if it means stumping up £1500 every couple of years, and you'll pay your mortgage off far earlier than you would if you stuck with the 1st mortgage you took out..

3% on 3k: 
Rest is in ISAs. Check here: 
Mine's nearly two years old, but you can still get 2.4%

This is the 3% bank account I have:
It's only on the first 3k, and when I signed up there was no paying in, or direct debit requirement.
Other 15k is in a 3% cash ISA with Coventry Building Society. They only do 2.1% now though.

Price comparison websites, usually moneysupermarket.  
  
Their top result for me now is 0.87% (LTV 64%). 
  
I have to pay fees each time I switch but it only takes 6 months before it becomes cost effective...

I'm still in my 2-year introductory period, after those two years are up (August) it jumps up to 4.5%
June is when I apply for my next mortgage. Gotta keep switching every time the introductory period ends, or you're just giving your money away.
Edit: Also, I'm UK based. Don't know what interest rates are like around the rest of the world.

Tesco bank current account pays 3% on 3k
Edit: yes I'm paying about £1500 each time I change mortgage. I break even about 6 months later. Pay £1500 to have a £500 per month mortgage for two years... The other option is a £750 a month mortgage.
Edit: oh reddit, down voting facts (backed up with sources) that could earn people a couple hundred quid...

What's your point? It's a bank account you can stick £3k in and earn 3% interest right now.  
  
I got mine before those restrictions were put in place (no minimum deposit, or direct debits required). I also have a 3% Santander account (no longer available) and meet the minimum amount simply by having a standing order put £1000 into the account, then another standing order transfer it out £950 a few days later, I have two direct debits totalling £50 to meet the direct debit requirements.
As soon as the introductory offers expire, my money gets moved to a new one, same with the mortgage. No point leaving it in low paying accounts when switching is so easy and simple.
Edit: And FYI, your mate's loan is a good financial plan, provided he isn't just spending that cash each month (or if his circumstances have changed and he needs that lower outgoing due to financial difficulties). I have a £500 mortgage and £500 goes to savings every month. I've built up £18k in 3 years and that's earning me more than what it would be saving me if I'd paid my mortgage with it.  
  
It also gives me a fall back position. If I'd paid £1000 on my mortgage every month, then lost my job, I'd be struggling to pay it. I've got 3 years of future mortgage payments stacked up. Good luck finding a mortgage company that would give you a 3 year payment holiday if you fell on hardship.

Price comparison websites.
  
Lowest mortgage on comparethemarket is 0.87% during introductory period.  
  
Tesco Bank do 3% on first 3k on their current account:   
  
Savings accounts are topping out at about 2.4% at the minute, mine's two years old though... Plenty to choose from here:

My mortgage interest rate is 0.9%.
I have 18k in a 3% bank account. While I keep beating my mortgage interest rate, I'm making money.
Think of your savings as loans. I'm borrowing at 0.9%, but loaning out at 3%... I'm making 2.1% that I wouldn't be making if I put it towards my mortgage.

Mining is a slow process. If you spent the money on coin, you'll earn more faster.
I've got a 6 GPU mining rig. It cost £3k in September. It's earned me £260 so far.
If I'd spent that £3k on Bitcoin instead. I'd have earned £2,220 by now...

All you've got is the potential to earn a grand. You haven't earned anything until you sell them.
In a month's time you could have doubled your money... or halved it.

Make that £2,743... Literally gone up £500 overnight. Can't earn that with a mining rig.

One that'll pop on 25th October when everyone gets their free Bitcoin gold and sells the BTC they just bought to get their cash back.
I'm thinking early November will be a good time to buy BTC.

Which app is that?

...and for the love of God, don't try selling after the fork on 25th
