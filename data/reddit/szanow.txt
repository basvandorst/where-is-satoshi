The whole problem is that he come on someone's important turf. You won't just create a website and dominate a drug market without pissing anyone up. This business brings an enormous revenue to many very important people in this world. One smart kid can't stand a chance... Sad...  :( i much rather live in the world with the silk road than without it.  Hold on Ross!

I wonder about credit company witch gives credit in bitcoins. Since bitcoin is deflation currency we might eventually have less and less dept. Right? 
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:11:59
Only reddit thinks that. Everyone else says "this might be a bubble"
