You haven't lost shit until you cash out.

Half a mill is my guess in the next few (3-5) years.

What do you think "Net Neutrality" was about?
Why do you think all of a sudden ISPs needed to be regulated under Title 2 instead of title 1 like they had for decades?

Hopefully it crashes back to $500.

Ahh reddits app is complete shit when it comes to isolating the context of subthreads.

He put in like $40, and started freaking out when it dropped, despite me telling him to invest when it was at $7600, and he dilly dallied until it was like 15k
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:42:41
My brother was asking if he should put his rent money in bitcoin...
This was after explaining you NEVER invest what you can't afford to lose literally every single time we talked about it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:17:48
Idk it just feels right.
Edit: I'm not betting my dick on it, it's literally just a guess.

Uh,  Mayer Amschel Rothschild was born in 1744, and the current day rothschilds are still individually billionaires off his fortune...
If ANY group of people in the history of the world had a chance to be rich for 500 years, it's them, because they're already halfway there.

Then make your own shit?
You're piggy backing off US, you have no right to get pissed off when we don't play the dumb appeasement game.

Gambling is illegal too, why do you think it's all on Indian reservations?
not to mention lottery money which is donated to schools.
OP, you need to figure yourself out.

He made that bet about $10,000; and y'all acted this same damn way, and he was right.
Then he bumped it up to a mill and now you're all forgetting that he's already won.
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:40:10
Sounds like he just really wants to eat his dick tbh.
