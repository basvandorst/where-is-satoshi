Apply a lognormal distribution to fees as opposed to a normal. It'll get rid of your pesky negative transaction fees. If someone can get me a list of all transaction fees paid, I'll build a representative distribution from it.

Considering that the communication time between Earth and Mars is 8 - 30+ minutes, I doubt that you'd have the same blockchain used for common transactions in both places. Sure maybe if you're talking large value items, you'd broadcast it back to earth. But for your every day cup of coffee, probably just stick with the Mars local blockchain.

It's difficult to replace national currencies in the short run, but in the long run, because they require constant intervention and they are 'delicate' (see 2008 financial crisis world is about to end), there is a great probability that in the long run, these national currencies inevitably misstep, leaving the smart money with no where to go but into decentralized, well-established, currencies. Once this happens to one or two large countries, you'll probably see a snowball effect of people leaving the national currencies. 
Maybe the fed will have to peg the dollar to BTC  as opposed to the other way around :)

Read the RAND corp report on crypto, its obvious from that that they look at any tactics they could deploy are dillitory only, and that eventual familiarity and adoption will happen when fiat is unable to serve. Therefore in answered to tour question, they can't do much other than delay the inevitable.

All these comments on trust reminds me of a short story I wrote:

Short story I put together. Enjoy

Whenever I have to introduce bitcoin or crypto currency in general, I typically approach it by going over the following points:
* Island of Yap example for how small groups can build consensus on who owns what
* Discuss what is money and what can be money (there are no wrong answers here)
* Intrinsic problems with banking sector security and the technological advantages that make crypto more efficient (constant data breaches and credit card numbers being tech from an ancient era)
* Mechanisms that profligate societies use to pass the cost of services back to citizens (inflation, confiscation/haircut, monitary unit change, future tax changes)
* Discussion on the difficulties surrounding wealth preservation during times of societal upheaval. (Danish government can confiscate valuables but can't steal your knowledge or crypto currency)

Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Hopefully consensus, or a mechanism to enable consensus will emerge to solve some of the problems you mention in your post.
Robust consensus/optimization systems may be slower than non-robust methods, but they will produce better results. An example is golden-section search vs. quadratic approximation, golden section takes considerably longer to compute, but is a much more reliable result than going with the quadratic. 
Personally, I think moving to a PoS or hybrid mining system is inevitable because it is more efficient, and it may enable better consensus voting.

With the recent find of natural gas in the PA/OH area, natural gas prices are getting very inexpensive in the north east making electrical head highly inefficient.

Strongly agree. This is the right way to do it. If no action in a week, disconnect another ethernet port.
