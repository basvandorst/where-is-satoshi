Does he? I feel that he changed the playground, he lost his enthusiasm just watch one of his old videos on youtube and you'll get what I'm saying.

Yes, my Bitcoin is not orange enough for them anymore. I'm thinking to stop listening soma.FM, and give those coins to someone to build a playlist for me. Better, because i can, I will pay a small chunk of bits for each song I like.
