Hey, Thanks Vlad, I actually just got an email with Jorge as soon as I saw your comment. Sent him the needed information, hopefully the issue is worked out

OH! I understand XD

What is it 
@_date: 2017-01-20 01:39:06
Did you refresh? Sometimes the site crashes for me and I have to manually update it via refresh. Could just be your Internet connection

I place limit orders. Some of them have fees, some don't. I don't get it and I can't really pick up a pattern

Subdivision ability?

I have sent an email
@_date: 2016-11-02 15:24:02
How do I go about increasing my limit? I'm stuck on $300

I have. I've emailed them and called them. Just not sure what to do next other than turn to the forums.

I sold on xcoins.io and got 15% extra

How do you add USD? When I click on add funds, it tells me all the options are no longer available 
@_date: 2016-11-02 14:51:25
I have Circle as well

Just wondering since I'm new, what happens when we've mined all the BTC?
@_date: 2016-11-02 15:32:05
Oh no, I've been transferring them to external accounts as soon as I buy them
@_date: 2016-11-02 14:39:38
It was recommended by a friend. Do you know of any other sites that I can purchase bitcoin instantly with low % fees? 
@_date: 2016-11-05 23:29:39
I just signed up. How long till they verify you?
