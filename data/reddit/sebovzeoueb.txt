This is true, and this is why when people have an electrical problem they will generally call an electrician. Bitcoin, in it's current state, isn't that accessible if you don't know shit about computers. Sure you can set up a wallet pretty easily, but securing it is a different matter.
And dealing in decimal places, that is downright offputting. It could just be a matter of habit, but I find it way easier to read a large number than a fraction of something.

Clearly you have not seen 98% of the population using a computer (I'm thinking of people like my dad...)

I'm fairly sure that if had an interest in Bitcoin, which he doesn't, he would probably download the wallet software and assume that it is safe, seeing how pretty much every other online money related thing is reasonably safe these days (PayPal, Buying things on websites, Online banking etc.). This is the thing, we've become used to software doing all the security stuff for us, so we aren't that careful anymore (and when I say we, I mean your average person, obviously).

The real purpose of dogecoin is to provide a friendly approachable version of cryptocurrency that is way more noob friendly. The community over at is good fun and very helpful and won't call you retarded because you don't understand something or you messed something up.
The fact that it is worth so little means you can play about with it without spending any significant amount of money, and still be spending 100 of something, hell even 1000 isn't worth much. You can also mine some on even the crappiest of hardware and get a few coins. It isn't about the dollar value, but the fun value and educational value.
I think it actually fills a quite important role in educating and enticing people into cryptocurrency.

I'm not saying I don't know how decimal points work, of course I do, just that at a glance they are harder to read, for me anyway. No need for idiot calling.
It could be a question of habit, but I find dividing less intuitive than multiplying. It's especially bad if you have digits either side of the point such as 243.3243 (random example). Maybe I am just an idiot, in which case I suspect I'm not the only one, but to me the digits after the .32 require more thought as to what they actually represent. I have to think that I have 243 and 3 tenths, 2 hundredths, 4 thousandths and 3 ten-thousandths.

Hell, I've been reading quite a bit about it and couldn't say I fully understand it. It's just way too techy for most people.
