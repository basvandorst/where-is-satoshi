Just read my PDF. I want nothing from you. This is my hobby

If you can think of a better format, let me know. Please.

zero scam man.  i get 10% of the satoshi they offer you if you use my links, plus a couple of other benefits from referrals.  Use my links or don't.  Don't care.  Want this to be open source for the masses.  If you like what I wrote, and can think of better ways of doing it, please do!!!

It is extremely low. The fountains are there to pass the time and earn free Satoshi. Totally ad based. The genius behind this system is taking advantage of the offer walls in these apps. And the referrals. Everyone I have listed all generate actual Satoshi, cash in USD or BTC. 
I've only made about 50 in cash, with absolutely zero in actual money that I've spent at all to start this. I don't count my mistakes from the last six months. Just a learning experience. Refined it and doing it right

Honestly have no idea how to even do that or what that means lol

Thank you!  Kinda freaked out now because I open a lot of attachments. Should I just copy and paste into the body of the email?  Google everything first!  Payouts, reviews, etc. All 100 percent on the level

Can't.  Free bitcoin cash fountain has been blocked by reddit.  So can't copy and paste.  Working on that blog post though.  Want to make this as easy and reachable as possible.

Yes!  And it was instantly profitable!!!  Zero investment. Nothing!  Freedom!!

No!  I'm doing it right now!  Just read it. All I'm asking. If it's crazy. Move along. Don't care
