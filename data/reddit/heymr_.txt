This is fake news. The hearing has not occurred yet.

Vitalik said so as well. Coindesk is bullshit, and the fact that they charge 3000 for tickets is bullshit, but cryptocommunity has nothing like Consensus currently, right?

But what about the announcements, we should at least see a bit of increase in price?

True. Is cryptocurrency (generally speaking) at a stage where it can make a stand in the market? What's your say on this?

It's a good point you bring to light. It's important not to lose the sight of the goal in the long-run. This is something many don't talk about nowadays. It's all about the price and how much you can gain from it. Good to know there are people out there who actually remember why we got into this motion.

Wow. Very promising indeed.

I'm with you on this one.

She is referring to cryptocurrency in general. Have a read. She also mentions the blockchain and understands it's capabilities in the coming future.

I second this.

There are a few ways to store bitcoin and make sure you go through the pro's and con's of every option. 
1. Desktop Wallet
This offers a number of advantages over the online wallet. These wallets can ONLY be accessed through your private computer that has your private keys stored in them. The exposure of your private key to the online world is reduced and thus increases the security of your coins. But desktop wallets are still vulnerable to hacks if your system were to be infected with a malware that is programmed to root the keys and steal your coins.
2. Hardware Wallet
They are more secure when compared to Desktop wallets. They are hardware devices(like USBs) that stores the user's private keys. One of the main benefits is the anonymity with which one can transact. There is absolutely no personal information linked to the wallet so no identification data can be leaked. But then again there are a few security risks. Insecure RNG(Random Number Generator) is one of the main concerns of the hardware wallet as cracking the RNG model is not very difficult thus breaching your security. Personally I would recommend  **Ledger Nano** S .
3. Paper Wallet
It is considered an extremely secure method to keep bitcoins safe from malware,hacks etc. It involves 'printing' and storing your bitcoins in an offline mode. It's important to note that it's not currency that you are printing but its the public key,i.e, wallet address, that allows people to transfer money into your wallet and a private key that gives yo access to fund spending. Keep in mind that bitcoins are NOT stored offline but it's your public and private keys that are stored offline. This is a form of 'cold storage' and it's security risks are low compared to the other two.
