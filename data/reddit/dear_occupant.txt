I may never get the chance to tell you this again, so I'm doing it here: thanks for writing ToneLoc. I quit hacking when I got old enough to go to big boy jail, but that program remained an essential part of my toolkit from the day I downloaded it from a BBS to my 18th birthday. It was simple, clean, and it did exactly what I needed it to do.
I have no idea how many vulnerable systems I discovered thanks to your program. With a few exceptions that came my way by word-of-mouth, probably all of them. For me, a teenager in the 1990s, ToneLoc was the equivalent of a Red Ryder carbine-action two hundred shot Range Model air rifle with a compass in the stock. And for the record, I never did shoot my eye out.

You can Google the basic information, but to make a long story short it was a wardialer, a program that would dial all the numbers in a telephone exchange and record the results. The point of this was to discover computer systems with dial-up access which you could then attempt to break into remotely. You can see one in action [here in this scene from the movie *Wargames*](
Part of what made TonLoc unique was that it took advantage of certain features in U.S. Robotics modems that would give you results beyond the average wardialer. If you had ToneLoc and the right modem, you could find all sort of strange things besides computers. Thanks to ToneLoc, I was the kid in high school who could get you free untraceable phone calls to anywhere in the world. Those days of Wild West hacking are long gone, but it was a hell of a lot of fun while it lasted.

The amount is small enough that it doesn't trigger the Gift Rule. The Ethics Committee does not concern itself with amounts under $50.
