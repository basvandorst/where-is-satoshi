Then what would my long code be for? I am certain it relates to bitcoin.  It says it is from 2013, and the name of the file (just the default name, not what i made it) is wallet_ and then some numbers.

Man, I think you cracked the code for me.  I transferred all of it to my wallet and it seems to have worked, says pending may take up to an hour.  If it worked then my old private wallet is emptied out then correct?

Well folks, I was able to use a deencrypter to figure it out, kinda. It spat out two new, shorter codes.  One must have been the public one, it shows up as watch only in my wallet.  The other code does not appear to be the private code - says displayed in raw base58 (not wallet import format).  Not sure how to make that into wallet format.

It was a way to "back up" blockchain accounts back in the day.  It says .aes.json

Yeah going to keep it, but blockchain said 0.00$ left in that wallet code.  Still hasnt finished yet.

Yes, I remember long time ago it was an option to back up using google drive.

Had this "code" as a backup from a wallet in 2013.  It is not a private key, although it may be an encrypted one.  Anyone know how to turn this back into a usable key?

I mean I crossed alot of it off.  If I cant acess it and someone finds a way too then good on them I suppose haha!

Bitadress says not valid.  The key I have has plus signs and slash marks in it, as well as capital letters, but I dont notice any of those things in the bitadress key generator.  They look to be similar in length.
