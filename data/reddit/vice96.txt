This so called asteroid has no chance of hitting the worlds largest gold reserve? 
Nuclear war.. ur just pulling scenarios out of your ass but lets assume there is a nuclear war. Why would gold have value? In the middle of a war im not looking for gold im looking for food and shelter. 
What tool are you going to use gold as?
What are you going to turn your malleable gold into?Lol.
Bitcoin is more than money, its an energy powerhouse. If used correctly it can do more.
There will be no catastrophe that wipes every single power grid on the planet and if there is one its also taking majority of the humans with it. At which point neither gold or bitcoin have (much) value.

We all know the meaning of rape, but do we all understand the meaning behind the word allegation?
Allegation: a claim or assertion that someone has done something illegal or wrong, typically one made WITHOUT PROOF. 
The easiest way to put someone under the radar is by throwing baseless allegations at them.
Edit: And the easiest way to make the public go against someone? Make sure the allegation is super sensitive. i.e., rape.
