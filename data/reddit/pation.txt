There was an infographic recently that talked about how often people use bitcoin for donations/charity. Perhaps we could share that information with kickstarter to point out that they could capitalize on an emerging demographic
EDIT: [Found it]( apparently around 55% of the community. That's a number worth sharing!

I've been playing around with [Dwolla]( for the past few months and it seems like it might have been helpful in your situation. (I started using Dwolla because I wanted to buy BTC from BitInstant, and they accept Dwolla transfers.)
Downside: I was kind of irritated by how long it took for Dwolla to start allowing you to send transfers (30 days or some such), but it probably makes sense for some financial reason. Long story short, you can send Dwolla like five bucks right now to start an account with them (to start the verification process), and then if you need to send your friend money just transfer those $$ to Dwolla and have them send him the money. I'm pretty sure that process can happen in a few hours once you've gone through the whole approved account business.
**TL;DR** Maybe look into Dwolla but I have no idea what I'm talking about
