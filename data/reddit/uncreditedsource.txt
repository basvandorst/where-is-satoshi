Update: Paul Krugman has just been arrested.
He was quoted as saying "...and I would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for you darn, meddling kids!"

According to your logic, If I said "that gay guy is sad," I would have to mean *all of the below*, making it a self-contradictory statement.
a :  happily excited :  merry &lt;in a gay mood&gt;
b :  keenly alive and exuberant :  having or inducing high spirits &lt;a bird's gay spring song&gt;
a :  bright, lively &lt;gay sunny meadows&gt;
b :  brilliant in color
:  given to social pleasures; also :  licentious
a :  homosexual &lt;gay men&gt;
b :  of, relating to, or used by homosexuals &lt;the gay rights movement&gt; &lt;a gay bar&gt; 
Words can be used in *one sense* without being used in another.
P.S. You're gay. (I'll leave it to you to interpret which sense I mean).
P.P.S. If you're going to win any Bitcoin arguments, you're going to first have to *not fail* at the English language.

I already said you "won" that argument. Go back and read again.
Why does the dictionary list four possible definitions? Is it possible for two people to each use the same word in a different sense? 
When I said *fiat*, I meant "government imposed." If you mean it as "no intrinsic value," then we are talking apples and oranges. 
*Proving your oranges* means nothing if I'm talking apples.
Who's hung up on proving an ideology?

If Overstock accepts it, that's pretty big news. This is looking like it will be a good year to own coins.

Dictionary aside, I believe there is an important difference between a currency mandated by government force (and ultimately violence, if you evade taxes), and one which is voluntary.
The dictionary definition doesn't really cover that important difference.

So, if someone edits the dictionary, they have the power to change reality?
Has the dictionary ever been updated or added to?
If so, does the dictonary catch up to reality, or is it the other way around?

"Fiat" means government decree. It's voluntary.

Actually, I don't care. I was describing a difference. Whether I used the right word to describe that difference or not, is a semantic debate, which you can *claim victory over* if you really want to. Words can be used in any of the applicable senses, but let's just posit that I *meant* the word according to the 3rd or 4th definition, as you chose to interpret it.
Now that you've "won."
Go back to your *source-of-reality* and look up the definitions of these two words:
*voluntary* and *forced*
Since you're smarter than me, I'm going to need you to explain to me the difference.


Changing descriptions changes reality. That's much too dangerous for the *likes of me* to handle.
