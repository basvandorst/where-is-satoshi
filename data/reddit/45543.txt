My god! Stop posting this!

Yeah, i'm sure that was the reason. Everyone believes you. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 00:57:26
Please. Just stop posting this. Learn to look before you post. How hard can it be.

And another piece of great logic from you. If paid shills exist then they must be here. No other option, right?
Can you point out one paid shill in this sub? 
Nevermind, i know the answer. Enjoy your delusions.

Apparently you're not allowed to argue that here considering all your downvotes. Only stuff like "bitcoin will replace fiat" won't get you downvoted to oblivion.

Between 0 and 100% is what my crystal ball told me.

Yet you had no problem when he called him dipshit and was the first person in the conversation to become rude. And after that he also called him a retard. But Kiddo suddenly upsets you?
Oh right. He's on your side so you just ignored that. Hypocrite. Ugh the behavior of some people here is disgusting.

Because it's impossible that new people sign up here. Everyone on Reddit has a 5 year old account. Also everyone on the planet should be completely positive about Bitcoin. Otherwise you are a paid shill. 
Go see a doctor. They can treat symptoms of paranoia and delusions.

"Poor Ross. I mean yeah, having plans to have people killed is fucked up but Ulbricht was put in to that position by the system"
Wtf? Are they serious?

I see no signs of moving to a bullish market again. Your post is based on hope alone.
