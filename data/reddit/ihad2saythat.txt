yes but you wouldn't get that much even with today's price...

Yes. It's orange bar charts representing what I believe are percentages. The flags represent the countries. Good enough?

I agree with you and what is more I can see pretty much parallel of what is happening here to entire reddit. This website used to be great for educating yourself and broadening horizons. Now it's just a bunch of screaming teenagers.
@_date: 2018-09-24 15:03:28

Holding something when it's worth equal to 50th global economy ([
 isn't very courageous or niche. When Bitcoin falls under 1 grand then it will be actuall test of "HODLers"
@_date: 2018-08-15 09:47:14
Unfortunately these days there isn't much worthy content on reddit and this applies to insightful opinions on here. Hence you won't really find any substantial advice on here which would be worth taking into account. You can see some dudes writing "first" for example or some motivational, emotional encouragements which are detached from reality.
The truth is very plain. Bitcoin is in free fall and as the old saying goes "trend is your friend" and you shouldn't play against it. Market is shaped by very few key players who have resources unimaginable to usual redditor.  The last year's Bitcoin run might not happen again and there are many crazy freaks here who hate to admit it.

Why we have posts like this keep on going and they locked discussion under hamster pic? I wanted to say something important over there.
@_date: 2019-03-25 12:44:29
Can it reach 2k before that though?
@_date: 2019-03-27 17:27:33
I'm missing the box for 2k per BTC

Why we care about this old fart. This is completely different era. Recently he said he discovered that Amazon is actually quite good... And he was wrong about calling them crap before... After how many years. I don't think he'll live long enough to see he was wrong on bitcoin.

In Poland there were cases of closing bank account due to crypto-currency trading. Local regulatory (KNF) has issued few warnings vs crypto firms recently and they informed general prosecutor about possibility of illicit activities. So there is that.

OTC means that there is a market of rich people who would see Bitcoin as a part of structured product. I can imagine that this would involve splitting risk between two parties and very possibly counter party as well. Because those would be highly customisable investments those outside of the triangle can only speculate. I personally think it will be good. Anything what increases Bitcoin liquidity is good and also helps to stabilize  the price.
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:09:21
I mean just transactions history with no acc details
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:39:50
no its what's happening now :D
@_date: 2018-11-29 10:14:53
When OTC kicks in that means we are looking at subjects willing to invest a substantial amounts but also wary about the risk. It will be in  interest of those involved in transaction to have reasonable gain/loss on contract. You are right implying that technically withdrawing tokens from the market reduces liquidity - but at the same time token is still benchmark for other derivatives and will be affected by them. At the end of the day what I'm saying is that people who go into this kind of agreements know each other (in most cases they are banks) and it is in their interest not to rip off one another. Banks these days got so much money that I'm not surprise they turn to bitcoin to vent some of the capital. The only problem is volatility and this will be eventually mitigated I believe.

Yeah I was also doing this project with this Asian guy. His name was Satoshi I think. And he asks me suddenly if I want to buy his "internet money" which he just made up and I said - sure why not but you going to regret it. So after a while I just sold it back to him for 100$ yeah I think I had most of them at the time.

He is selling cocktails for 5$. Lets say cost of one is around 2 $ so your investment returns after around 50 thousand cocktails served.

Let me tell you about dips. I recently bought sour cream one with chive for Nachos and I thought - "This is the DIP! I love sour cream and chive. It must go along nachos very well." However it was pretty bad and I was greatly disappointed. Therefore my search for perfect dip continues. As well as for bitcoin investors.

It's very hard to asses what's the legal status of Bitcoin. I can speak for EU: first and biggest issue is how to classify bitcoin. Without this step it is impossible to draw further conclusions as you are missing the "legal vantage" point. At the moment it appears to be considered as investment vehicle and I can see that this is the opinion given by banks, politicians and some governments. It appears that we are at the stage of this becoming the letter of law. However they face obstacles as bitcoin was intended and even maybe should be perceived as currency. Currencies also may be investment vehicles but there is socially accepted "grey area" about them which was minuscule problem so far. I you are going for holidays and exchange currency - this will generate gain/loss and technically speaking this is subject to TAX. However no one really reports those kind of transactions neither anyone monitors that. TAX on currency gain/loss is usually paid of large sums and by professional institutions or traders. And this appears to be unwritten law which no one really question because popular currencies don't deviate as much from each other. Anyway I got only time to touch the surface of issue cause I'm at work however legal classification of BTC is extremely hard at the moment.
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:44:31
This is all true if you consider that those are short contract hodlers
