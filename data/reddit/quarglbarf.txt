Like I said, I believe it will be the backbone of global cryptocurrencies. Whether that's against the point or not isn't really my concern.

Alright, but like I said those deficiencies only apply if the currency is supposed to be used in day-to-day transactions, which Bitcoin won't in my opinion. Not just because of the immutability, but also because of limitations in scalability.
If you consider Bitcoin as something like a gold standard for cryptocurrencies, the deficiencies no longer apply.

Like I said, it's comparable to gold. Gold isn't used in everyday transactions and it's still worth a whole lot.  
It's a store of value.

Ok. You never mentioned structural deficiencies though, only that their value is based merely on future expectations.  
What are those deficiencies in your opinion?

250,000 is way over the top, I agree, but I can see the price reaching 6 figures in the future.
You're right that the price right now is largely speculative, but the entire field of cryptocurrencies is still developing and evolving, and I do think they are the future of currency. The features of Bitcoin with it's limited supply and immutable blockchain make it the perfect candidate to be the backbone that connects and stabilizes the other cryptocurrencies.  
Ethereum lets you build separate currencies and applications and is much more than a simple currency, which is why I believe it will be the foundation of day-to-day transactions.
Of course I might be completely wrong and the whole thing really is just a bubble and cryptocurrencies will fade into the oblivion of illegal activities. This is all just guesswork now, we'll just have to wait and see.

I think you have it wrong as you consider Bitcoin as the actual currency used for everyday transactions.
I think Bitcoin will take the place in crypto currencies that gold had in Bretton Woods. People don't worry about lending gold and interest rates on it. Bitcoin has shown that it considers the blockchain holy and infallible. The currency for daily use will be based on Ethereum or something that has shown willingness to be flexible with the blockchain and where you have options to manipulate the supply.

You think Venezuela would be better off if they had an "immutable currency"? That's not the cause of their problems.
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:09:02
They won't. Just like the general public right now doesn't use gold. Still, it's a good investment.

That claim is unsubstantiated at best. I already told you how I think this is going to play out. If you don't agree that's fine, but you're not going to change my opinion without providing any insight of your own.
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:58:23
Actually I believe that's one of its strengths. Real life currencies aren't immutable either.

We’re living in the digital age. Even a store of value in this modern age will be quick to transfer and exchange. Bitcoin fits those requirements perfectly.  
Other Cryptocurrencies will be the ones for daily use. I think the standpoint is pretty clear here.

Something built on top of Ethereum, maybe IOTA can find a role as well. Systems like these, that offer more than just a fundamental blockchain.  
That's not to say there's anything wrong with improving those fundamentals, so continued work on BTC to keep up with the demands of the ecosystem is a good thing of course.
