I will be able to install bitcoin core within a few hours. 
Also the person I am sending to is a guy I trust so even if it ends up sending 6 BTC I can get my 3 back.
I have created another transaction with a fee but somehow it also got stuck even though I am paying 37.5 satoshi per byte.
Edit: few hours ago I was able to access the propagation showing % of the network and it even reached %37 of the network, however now it went back to "No Inventory Information Available".

Here is what I have done.
I created a 3rd transaction after I got my private key from decrypting my old backups.
Then used [this guide]( to do a double spend on my first transaction.
It went through rather quickly because I had a relatively high fee. Now since I double spent the first transaction the second tx got immediately rejected and I successfully did the intended transaction.
Thank you all for helping me. reddit community was better than expected :)

I have spent over a day trying to get the private key from blockchain but their new UI does not show me where to export my key. if i had it then it would be easier.
I have a wallet backup in a aes.json but I do not know how to decrypt the key even though I have the decryption key.
Thanks a lot for coping with me dooglus.

That was my thought when I did the second one.
I thought that the second one will be confirmed before the first thus making the first one be rejected as a double spend.

Hey roswell67
I kinda recommend LINE over whatsapp
people want more anonymity :) line can do with a username only rather than phone number

Is there any way to "Cancel" this tx so I can add another with fee?
