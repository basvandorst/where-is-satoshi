Indeed there have been. The thing is, in my opinion, the US is way to big for its many lazy citizens to overthrow at this point. Not only that, but we'd have to have so many citizens on our side to overthrow the police and military or they'd have to be in favor of losing their jobs to the people they're revolting against. 
I honestly think one of the better things that could happen is the US just goes bankrupt and we end up bought out then splitting into little countries who slowly gain independence.

I wish the OP would actually see this. For someone who
"makes a living writing content"
I would have hoped he would research something he's about to rant about. If he's really concerned then the onus is on him to use unobtrusive advertisers.

I guess I have different traveling priorities than you. If I'm about to get on a plane I **must have** my wallet, passport, and glasses. There's no possible way to forget these things. They are my **only** task when getting on a plane.
