Spend every dollar you would be spending on cc interest getting back in

First, buy one of these hardware wallets  immediately.
Second, tell fucking no one. You're a millionaire. You hit the lottery. You're rich. Tell people and they're coming for it. 
Third, think about how much you want to sell. You could sell it all right now, and be 1.2 million rich. That's perfectly acceptable tbh. Or you could decide you don't need that much money right here and now, and sell maybe 100 or 200 and hold the rest until you feel you need the money. Speculation is that btc will rise, but who knows when? It might crash tomorrow?
Congrats if this is real tho!

I'm wondering how exactly he came to be in possession of this coin because it seems he has absolutely no idea what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:46:48
4k at most and do dollar cost averaging. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:38:38
I recommend dollar cost averaging. That's buying a specific dollar amount at regular intervals over a period of time to minimize volatility. 
There may be a dip. But if there isn't, and you're waiting to invest and it keeps going up, now you aren't in. 
On the other hand, if you invest it all right now and it crashes, well boi wouldn't that suck. 
Spread it out, you're safe from either extreme. 
(Copied from a previous comment but that's dollar cost averaging)

I was relooking at this post just yesterday. Classic

Blogger? He's one of the most prolific experts in the field. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:54:53
 It's only 500 dollars if you're buying a whole bitcoin though. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:38:56
Is that in yuan or usd?
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:46:05
I think there's a "bubble" of weak hands, sure, but buried in that bubble are real enthusiasts as well. One good crash will shake them out like fleas from a dog and then we'll climb again as wall street and other financials get involved. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:43:55
Unfortunately I think it would be more like 99.998%. Close though. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:53:48
Had to just keep trying for a few hours until it let me log in. Coinbase on DNR orders out here.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:44:25
Why the fuck would you sell that? You only had two days worth of patience?

He's getting the same amount of dollars every two weeks. But it's all of his income.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:59:48
Or the ledger nano s

That's the gist of it, yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:49:29
... sideways?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:48:36
Oh holy fuck, solid timing. An exchange sent my bitcoin with a fee of 20 satoshi/byte on Monday and it JUST came through as I was reading this thread. Phenomenal
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:08:15
 They couldn't have predicted weeks out from production though
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:55:32
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:37:59
Only wasn't to indicate a small amount but rather that you'd have to spend nearly 10k ( 8k in euro??) to possibly make that 500. That's significant capital 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:56:51
Yes, he's that important. You having your head in the sand doesn't mean anything. You aren't the arbitrator of who is important in the cryptocurrency realm.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:34:00
And the commercial break! Hahaha
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:45:48
This is essentially extreme dollar cost averaging. If his salary was say 2000 a month he'd getting whatever that's worth in btc the moment he gets paid
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:48:51
I sent a transaction 3.5 hours ago. It's only undergone 2 confirmations. There's just a fuckton of volume moving and apparently coinbase's / gdax's default fees aren't high enough to get into the priority lane of blockchain confirmations.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:47:17
Curious to watch the exchanges during the ep. Someone plot em against commercials!
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:58:11
Anyone who's made a coinbase account but never taken the plunge might be interested. Not expecting big numbers though. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:37:41
Looks like some minor sellwalls at 10,100 as well. Not surprised
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:42:51
Very nice. And a lot of people who normally wouldn't be interested in cryptos use yahoo

Is gdax faster, though?

If I knew how to make a gif I'd make one of people doing the wobble with "HODL BABY HODL BABY HODL BABY HODL" flashing

Bitcoin is not even close to as popular as its going to be, either. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:11:50
If my bitcoin isn't worth at least 100000 bottlecaps by 2024 then I'm not hodling.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:09:07
 So coinbase wallets I'm assuming would be a no go
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:07:21
WAKE UP MR. WEST!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:12:08
1. Bitcoin increases in value as more transactions take place. 
2. Several American financial investment firms are entering bitcoin in the next year, starting with bitcoin futures in December. 
So what are we missing that you know?
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:01:08
They sell all their coins. We buy them. Now they have to spend more to buy what their investors require. Price flies up. Massive gains either way. Am I seeing where you're going?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:46:23
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:22:05
same same same baby. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:26:34
Yes, because there's no demand past 10k right?
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:59:49
This is a very good point. If we here on reddit can put 2+2 together here, so will millions of other indviduals as well as individuals WITH millions, and they'll be just waiting to take advantage of this opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:37:20
 Aren't we all
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:48:21
 Do NOT dump it all in. Set up an automated weekly buy of say, $50 or something you're comfortable with, this is called dollar cost averaging. 
Let's say bitcoin crashes to 3k tomorrow and you put all your money in.  You just lost 66% (although I have fill confidence bitcoin will rocket above where it is now even if it crashes, in the short term that SUCKS.)
On the other hand, let's say you wait for a big "dip" before you go all in but instead bitcoin just keeps climbing. Now you're sitting there with 3k that could've been 9 or 10k, who knows.
Dollar cost averaging over time let's you average out the EXTREME volatility of btc (and anything)

But what if a solar radiation flare destroys all electronics worldwide???
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:30:31
And this Reddit board isn't that many people or even that significant of a percentage of bitcoin owners. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:02:16
What are y'all invested in? I'm in bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, ARK, ripple &amp; monero currently. Looking at Iota as well.
