Im pretty sure some nice lady donated 37 BTC then 42 the next day. After that she donated 1BTC to a redditor who designed a logo for here and said something alone the line "The cost is 1 BTC lol" and received 1BTC.
So I would say that if you were following the news a little bit more it was all over the place on this sub 3-4 days ago. Being skeptical is a good thing but a small amount of research and you could had find all these information.
Have a nice day.

So you're mad because OP is generous AF and you wish that he gave you BTC rather than giving it to charity ?
A lot of early adopters are sitting on 10k btc and I don't see them doing something as great as OP.

@_date: 2014-07-11 13:39:14
I think 1000$ is a realistic view but from still a stretch for me, 2015 will be the year of bitcoin. The mining gold Corp will slowly start mining and holding btc but it will take more than that to convince the skeptics, after breaking the 1000$ mark and having a strong bottom to hold the price their you'll see more adopter before than that the market will go sideways for a while with slow growth.

Yeah on the long term if you bought at $2 $10 $20 $100 you might be happy with this statistic. 
But the truth is that some people bought at 500$ 800$ 1000$ the big picture you can pleasant , but in the fine details it sucks for a major part of the peoples who bought at "high" price.
Early adopter don't really give a damn and most of them are preaching the long term, because their investment were minimum and they are probably sitting on large amount of bitcoin. 
Let say that someone bought 100 bitcoin at $1 each at $450 they still get $45 000 so the difference between $50 000 and $45 000 at this point is not a big deal when you invested $100 you still get a significant amount of "profit" on your "investment".
Sure its a lot of money and no one like to lose some but eh, it's nothing compared to someone who bought 78.671328671 btc at $571 each, now you start sweating bullets, because the money invested more significant. I know people say "do not invest more than you can afford to lose" but you know some peoples never listen.
I get your point but trying to reason with people that have a LOT of money invested in btc is kinda hard, I get paid in BTC ( I run 2 jobs ) and the money I get paid in BTC I decided to keep all my BTC to run the long term game. But has someone who just bought a house and saw my banked BTC go from $4000 to $2700 is kinda hard. 
I am not an early adopter and I know the BTC ride is a rollercoaster but right now the price is crashing and it get frustrating for everyone that look at the short/mid term.

Could be but I think the market cap (to low) and the adoption rate (a bit slow) of bitcoin is what will limit this exponential growth, at one point we can achieve this but not without major money pumped in the market the number of bitcoin created per day vs the demand is enough to create a sideway / down trend on the short term. 
We need more demand and less supply for the price to sky rock if the difficulty increase and less bitcoin is put in circulation and the demand is increasing from these gold company we might see such growth but it wont be before another year imo.
But this is just my opinion on the subject at the point I think that every angle on bitcoin is valid it can always go both ways.

I've been using cavirtex for over a year now, they have excellent service and they offer a special debit card that you can change btc to cad directly on it.

I don't get why user never understood this, it's not because Paypal/Braintree is toying with bitcoin that the price will sky rock. Bring more money into bitcoin, more people that want to buy less that want to sell and your price will rise. 
Right now they are putting in place a platform to accommodate marginals and people that use bitcoin. The thing is that they announce Bitcoin adoption but in the same news they cut the leg of bitcoin with a one touch paiement easy for Mr.Dummy.
Bitcoin right now is to complicated for the mass population, if VISA accept to convert directly credit money to bitcoin you'll see the moon.
@_date: 2014-09-30 16:54:41

A private key in the context of Bitcoin is a secret number that allows bitcoins to be spent. Every Bitcoin wallet contains one or more private keys, which are saved in the wallet file. The private keys are mathematically related to all Bitcoin addresses generated for the wallet.
Edit: Also a good read 
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:48:35
I get it they are a business and they probably taking a small cut on top of the "network fees" (it's what they calling it). The problem is that we need better algorithm for transactions fees.
I choose to let the coins sit there because by paying high fees I contribute to pull the unrealistic price upward.

Get a cold wallet to store bitcoin, never store your bitcoins on exchange sites. Only use sites to buy then move all or most of you bitcoin to a wallet that you own the private key.

From what I understand you created a hack for a game got paid 2400$ splitted  50/50 with your friend, got paid in bitcoin (via coinbase) transferred BTC to Fiat then to you bank account?
I get that you're trying to be the most honest with your parent, but trying to explain bitcoin and coinbase to them was probably a mistake. 
They were in full alarm mode wondering if their son was a drug dealer or getting funded by ISIS (You know how we old folks are sometimes) and probably not 100% receptive to your explanations.  I am pretty sure that your parents are nice people, but right now they are worried about you and the things you're saying are totally foreign and sounds like bullshit to them.
Now for the hard part explaining bitcoins and exchange etc... 
There is many way to "explain" bitcoin.
Try to explain bitcoin as a stock options, that you worked and decided to be paid by stock options and sold them right away via a "stock" exchange (coinbase).
You can tell them that bitcoin is like gold and there is a finite amount of them. Like gold the price fluctuate via offer and demand, that you need a third party (coinbase) to buy or sell the coins.
I would invite you to browse this subreddit and show them videos of CNBC talking about bitcoins and how they would buy it over gold. Video of credible source to their eyes, videos of peoples that "are not bullshiting".
I would explain them the risk behind bitcoin (it fluctuate a lot and can crash at anytime) and why you withdraw the money right away (to save your pay day). This will seems like a smart move to their eyes.
A lot of people in this thread suggested that you should had kept the money as bitcoin. In a sens they are right because if your 1200$ in 6 months is worth 2400$ you'll be kicking yourself in the butt.
I get it, 1200$ at 16 is a shit load of money, and you want to have fun with it. the best move would have been to keep maybe Half of it in BTC and withdraw the other half. I guess this is a thing to consider for next time.
Good luck young one.

The problem with quantum computer is that they could potentially break every encryption methods. Also they could "decrypt" wallets in a matter of minutes aka finding private key for X wallet.
On the same swing they do math problem so fast that one Quantum computer could be all the hash-rate the block chain needs thus centralizing the whole blockchain into one (good/evil) entity.
But right now quantum computer are not a common reality and I think that people who owns them have better things to do than breaking the blockchain (for now).
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:49:22
Yeah but that will be the next "cold war" the race to quantum computing and I feel like a lot of top country are just lifting their nose at this... 
If you're looking at RSA encryption, it takes the product of two larges prime numbers, the product serves as the key. So you need to compute the solution to decrypt. factoring a 600 digit number with conventional computer would take the age of the universe. Quantum computer, well about in an hour.
In the end it would be a battle of pissing contest, who has the better quantum computer...

@_date: 2017-08-14 18:11:47
Why would it not let you mine faster ? If a quantum computer can calculate SHA256 super fast how that would result in poor hashrate ?
Softfork to a quantum-safe asymmetric cryptography would mean that this fork would require some sort of quantum computer to make this fork happen ?
Doubling the key or hash length require large scale keys which takes a lot of space, like I stated up to 1TB of data for a key and can take up to 5 days to create... not very convenient.
On the fact that it would render obsolete all cryptography, is "idiotic" tell that to all the top researcher in the field that are really concerned about Quantum computing.
It's true that they are migrating to "Quantum safe" crypto SHA-3, BLAKE2. And right now Even D-WAVE is not able to run "crpyto breaking" (shor) algorithm but it's just a matter of time. Like I said I feel like there is a lot a persons that are ignoring Quantum computing because it's at a baby stage...

1. Mr.X create a word file and upload it on the website.
2. He sets an amount of money that people need to pay to access the file.
3. The website encrypts the file server side and make it available to everyone.
4. Mr.Y pays the amount asked, the file is transferred to his account and he can access the content. 
5. Mr.Y download the content, create a torrent and upload it to any torrent site?

Sorry to break the news but Quantum computer is on another level than regular computer, Google found that a 1,097 Qbits computer outperform current supercomputers by like 3xxx times and personal computer by something like 100 millions times...
The thing is that Quantum computer are really good at math problems, prime numbers and that kind stuff... Playing games not so much ;P. 
The things is that if you want to crypt a RSA key that is good against (current) Quantum computer it takes five days, for the encryption and decryption and a Terabyte of disk space...

I would suggest to take a look at BTC graph over the years and focus on the big dips. Would you be able to hold your horses if the price goes from 4200$ to 1000$ tomorrow and not sell ? 
Don't EVER EVER invest more than what you're willing to lose in BTC. even if right now we are on a all time high, everything is running smooth. BTC could crash tomorrow or slowly to a million over 10 years.
This is not GM, AMD, Microsoft, or a stock with predictions and margins etc... Nobody knows what future holds for BTC.
Right now its the gold rush and people are starting to talk more and more about bitcoin. It's in the news, papers, online name it. We are not even close to full market penetration but what if big pockets decide to Influence the US gov and ban bitcoin?
Who knows maybe china will ban bitcoin? ;)

You think that they coded S2X straight up, quite development for the last 3 months and the code was 100% ready, free of bugs and optimal ?
If you have EVER done any software development you would know that a product is never final when delivered it's just optimal or less buggy than it was. You never code something on the first try and VOILA! release! 
You can always improve code, make it more efficient, cleaning functions, optimizing and you do that to the very end. They stopped 3 months ago... fairy fucking tails and magic, is what you're speaking.

Well in the same way that stakeholders creates rarity on bitcoin because of the finite number, it also create negative movement when panic sales occur. 
If there is only two person hold bitcoin, One sell the other buy or both hold. But more people you add to the pot you create rarity but you create bigger swing as well. I have been following bitcoin since 2011, when I was an early adopter I sold out of panic and out of necessity back in the days and a lot of people did.
Now I got thicker skin and at 400$ swing is like "meih" 1000$ "Well this will be interesting" 2000$ "Swing time for some cheap coins boys" 3000-4000$ worries me lol. New comers will panic sell at 500$ swing because they bought at ATH and are freaking out.

If I had the answer to that question I would give it to you, I think that in point and time, if LN or Atomic Swap is not release and we are really in need people will get onboard. But only with a tested solution, proof of concept and minimal disturbance of the ecosystem.

You're talking about censorship, but you're mixing up consensus and censorship. Not considering an idea and brushing it aside without talking about it is censorship, talking about an idea and rejecting it because it's not what we need right now is consensus.
Core developer will bring people in and people will move out, the SegWit2X people are convincing the traditional channel and doing agreement behind close door rather than arrive at a consensus with the core and are trying to force their vision by buying miners and having the biggest hashrate. This is a direct attack on the community and bitcoin.
also what the hell you're talking about S2X is 4MB max 8MB block weight Segwit already allows 2MB max 4MB block weight. Did we need it right now ? I don't think so looking at the adoption rate and how many people are jumping in. Also SegWit allow legacy node to still "understand" segwit transaction. SegWit2X require EVERYONE to upgrade their legacy node to the segwit2x which makes it that there is no legacy anymore.
By FORCING people to upgrade because it render old nodes not compatible with a new software that we don't need right now you're forcing people into your mentally. Then you create a loop of power and everyone have to follow your fork what ever the fuck you do. So deeper you go in the rabbit hole, more freedom you give them to do what ever the fuck they want. 
So yeah sell yourself to a small group of people that have no idea what they are doing, you think people are freaking out about bitcoin take over? Like I said trying thinking a little bit ahead more and 10 minutes from now for a change and see the big picture.
I can see the big picture right here, miners will always prioritize the 4MB blocksize to the fullest and wait until blocks are full to the max, so they don't spend resources and power on half empty blocks. Because S2X will sell at 15% of bitcoin, at first filling a block will be fast because a lot of people will dump their S2X, but after a week or two less transactions, slower to fill block to the max, transaction will take longer and people will start to pay higher fees to create incentive for the miner to mine the next block and we are full circle. 
Also you're thinking about yourself, YOU, the guy that can afford a 4TB hard drive, not everyone can. I certainly can but some people can't and that's the reality. You're speaking about UTXO like its a big chunk of the data but its only represent like what 2-3Gb of the total size of the blockchain right now ?  It's not like its a significant size of the whole deal.
I don't think better management of UTXO is the solution to scalling when it's .75% of the total size of the blockchain right now and you're asking for double size of blocks, uh oh... we have a big gap to cover. Trust me if S2X succeed people will regret it in one to two years because you'll be stuck with these megalomaniac push what ever the fuck they want. 
Blockchain will be so big that decentralization will be a story of the past and some mining equipment will be favored over others. You just lack of vision good sir, even tho you are working development.

Here's MY prediction, you will have another 1 week of sideways trends because of the stupid fork spooks then after all the moron realize that nothing changed and it's the same as other spooks, china ban, diamond bullshit. 
Bitcoin will rally and hit 8100$ before the end of the year and will hit 10k by late January mid February.
Now you're pretty much asking yourself "How the fuck this guy is predicting that?". I don't im just sounding technical and shit, I don't know shit like most of the people around here. Do your own research and buy and sell based on your own gut. 
The only safe passage in bitcoin is to hold until bitcoin either hit 1mil or 0, don't invest more than what you can afford to lose.
Have a great day.

It's a relative popular opinion I would say and it's simple mathematics, but there is alternative option to increase block size. Like a good functional Lightning Network or Atomic Swap.
If LN can be coded right and have a payment processor implementing it right, god this would be great. If Litecoin and ETH can stay stable Atomic swap is a great option too.

Coinbase act like they don't know but they know, they are going fullblast S2X. S2X have tons of corporate support and like BCH a small fraction of the community.
The problem with Bitcoin is higher the price is richer the attacker are, none of them will ever switch all their BTC to BCH or S2X they just want to create a shitcoin drag some loser in dump and run... That's pretty much the strategy right now.
What if I told you that you cold make 25% money on your paycheck just by having a small percent of your coworker to support you in some random scam shit and you'll have 0 consequences after all?
Well that BCH and S2X scamming people out of their bitcoin making profit on top of them, rinse and repeat every 5 months. There is no real solution to the problem long term, because these "visionaries" are early Bitcoin adopter and are basically millionaire now... so they can just pump and dump shitcoins, they can bribe exchanges/payment processor into  integrating their shitcoins.
The Problem is not the bigger blocks, everyone know that we will need bigger block someday. It's how it has been done behind closed door as the N2Y agreement trying to take control of bitcoin.

Since nobody seems to be eager to reply with a clear opinion I will.
Right now bitcoin have a lot of transaction 1MB block and hold so many transaction, which increase the fees because there is no system to judge what is spam and was is a transaction. Equally there is not system to judge if your transaction is more important than your neighbors.
The option is in the hand of everyone, you want your transaction to go faster you pay higher fees. Since the 1MB gets filled and one is created every 10 mins higher fees you pay higher chances you get into the next block.
The problem with block increase, is that if you want to clear the line right now you would need bigger block and this require a hard fork and code upgrade. Not that bad right? No it's not that BAD. 
Let's say to sustain the current traffic of bitcoin we need 8MB block and you get low fees transaction are super fast etc.. everyone is happy.
Fast forward 2 years in the future, bitcoin is a bit more mainstream a lot of people starts trading it, invest in it. We are seen as MUST have asset the traffic had increased 10 folds... 8MB -&gt; 16MB -&gt; 32MB -&gt; 64MB -&gt; 128MB -&gt; 256MB -&gt; 512MB -&gt; 1024MB -&gt; 2048MB -&gt; 4096MB
Now we need 4Gig blocks to sustain traffic, but remember blocks gets released every 10 minutes, so you need to validate a block before one get released. 
Now nodes have to validate 4Gb blocks every 10 mins, blockchain is growing 4GB every 10 minutes. Considering there is 6x4GB blocks in an hour 24GB increase in an hours 24 hours in a day 576GB per day of blocks 4TB a week. 208 TB of data in a year...
I don't think the regular average joe will run a node for fun and have to keep a datacenter in his house just for "fun" or to help bitcoin. 
So you're creating centralisation of nodes and only big companies can run them. So you need a "bank" to run your nodes ( hold the ledger of all transaction ) and we came full circle. We just recreated the traditional banking system.

gloat over S2X winning ? I think that S2X is a stupid and unnecessary option right now, that blocksize increase is not needed at the moment, but will be in the future. The deployment is rushed and botch no replay protection is an attack against bitcoin core and forcing all nodes to upgrade to S2X if they will will be the demise of bitcoin at we know it, because we will be stuck in a vortex of forced code without community consensus. 
That's my take on S2X, I am just not understand why you're spewing all your BS on Breadwallet. You own your own private key with Bread so if you don't like it move along, if you're not sure if they are calling S2X bitcoin or not in the long run just migrate your coins from Bread to another wallet with a clear take on it.

@_date: 2017-11-07 16:52:43
People who are following blindly Segwit2X will say that we are wrong, and they are not wrong to an extent that eventually bigger block will be needed that is clear as day. 
But there is a way to do things and push an update on any big software and Bitcoin it's not only a software its a payment network. Right now it's like testing a antidote on human and they are not sure if it will make you sicker or not. We all know at some point we will need it but we are skipping the clinical testing and going straight to mass production an the consequence might be brutal.
Bitcoin is all fun and game but let me remind you that Litecoin and ETH are still pulling their fair share or market. If they fuck the whole bitcoin ecosystem one of them might just take the poll position.

I am in no way a S2X supporter on the form it was, but if you do the math, bigger block will be needed. LN is really a great idea if payment processor/exchanges/wallet start supporting it. If they don't LN is just a great idea that is useless if no one support it.
Like I said if you think that bigger block will not be needed in 2-3 years you believe that bitcoin will never scale up in transactions and will flat line at the rate it is right now. 
Segwit support a block Weight up to 4MB, the beauty in Segwit is that legacy node can still acknowledge the transaction by discarding the witness ( everything above 1MB )  and still function. S2X was requiring everyone to upgrade their nodes and have all of us stuck with them and fucked on the long run.
We could have 2MB legacy base block and double the transaction per block and add witness data on top of that, or scale it gradually to 1.5MB or 1.1MB what ever works realistically. jumping the gun from 1MB to 4MB and max 8MB was just stupid and on top of that being stuck with bad dev was even worst.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:03:11
Not for another two years, the problem with S2X is not the blocksize, it's whom is doing it and why they are doing it right now. They are trying to push an agenda on the BTC community, if their intention were good they would have a replay protection and be the bigger man show us that we were wrong about the whole thing. 
All the code dev by the core is open source and open for debate, S2X is a closed minded option. Their github is been inactive for a month now. Why? A lot of developer called the port poorly coded and untested. Who in their right mind would deploy an untested code...

Hey Bread dude, I use your wallet and I will sit tight with my bitcoin during the fork. I would appreciated that if you guy decide to go with S2X and decide to call it "Bitcoin" you warn the users about it in app.
Something like "Yeah finally we decided to side with the useless 4MB chain that nobody need right now and will be super hard for normal users to run a node in 3 years" would be a nice warning :)

Dude you were a BU/BCH and now Segwit2X advocate like it was fucking water in the desert and they were the savior of everything and core is terrible blbalbalbal core is core until its not core anymore.
You have failed to explain me why on earth we need 4mb blocks right now ? Why do we need to scale right now split the chain, rather than looking at the evolution of thing setting S2X aside and waiting to deploy when it will be actually useful or we wait for a viable LN and never upgrade to 4 MB block keep the blockchain to a smaller reasonable size that everyone can download and run their own node right now. 
Rather than looking at a couple TB chain in 3-4 years only have people with deep pockets and full blown dedicated servers running on a gigabit connection running nodes... Like I said numerous times 4mb might be a necessity but not right now and if LN comes to fruition we will be able to weed out a LOT of useless transactions and turn 50 into one.
Now explain WHY, you S2X defender why we need it so fast and right now. No half spewed answer like "Well because bigger block is better and we will need them in the future" Why we need it in a week and a half.

Guys this guy got the solution we only change the number 1mb for 4mb, shit what is the great fuss about all this bullshit...
You seriously think that the intention is to make one single tiny little change? Go back and do you homework and do the math how 4mb and 8mb transactions have impacts on the scale of running nodes and the size of the entire blockchain in the next 5 years... 
Segwit2x is like applying tuck-tape on a wound to stop the bleeding, shit will hurt like hell when you'll try to remove it afterward. 
The bottom line is that people only think about their little fucking transaction. What will happen in 5 years when the blockchain is 1TB large? who the hell will want to start a node from scratch ? Let me tell me who, people with deep pockets and servers in data-centers with 1 Gigabits connections.
So what happen if only a select group of people can run nodes lets says what 500 nodes ? You fuck up the decentralization of bitcoin, the power is in the numbers of nodes, to create a true decentralized ledger. 
Think more than 5 months ahead before says "oh yeah it's just a little change we are only doubling/quadrupling the size of blocks"

Nothing is sure in bitcoin, but the fact that this guy is a multi millionaire and is not using his power as a public figure to denounce S2X and the attack on bitcoin, tells you a long stretch about him being in touch with the real problems with bitcoin. 
It's the same shit as the BCH fork people were not which one would ended up "winning", the S2X attack is way more serious to be honest and have bigger implication on the the nature of bitcoin as everyone knows it in the long run.

At this point this is just cynical, we did not need bigger blocks right now thus why they are not working on it.
You think that core dev is a group of Illuminati protecting the sanctity of the white paper like a bible ?  They probably have more bitcoins and a couple of people combined here. What is the advantage of denying something that the network need when it will be needed ? 
I would rather have a bunch of normal geek developing bitcoin and their incentive is that they own bitcoins and it's at their advantage to make it work than having shady people who works for bankers paying dev with money to code what was basically a grave for the network.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:40:39
Segwit adoption Lightning network, look at the number of transaction per day and size of blocks and what segwit offer in block increase you'll see that there is plenty of space in the block right now for most of the transaction. But people are complaining about the high fees and are not switch their BTC on Segwit address... The problem falls on overage user too not only on the way bitcoin is designed right now.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:08:25
Reunite ? Have you been on ? They are calling for the death of bitcoin and spam everything to let know that BCH is the real bitcoin.
They were focus on big block only and that it! They were celebrating S2X because of the 8MB block and now are pushing (again) BCH because of the 8MB blocks... So yeah good luck with your reuniting party.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:50:58
Let me answer you straight;
The problem that S2X have is that NOBODY in the big market is talking about S2X or are talking S2X AS bitcoin. With all the FUD and Drama around it, the big players are smart enough to stay away from the drama and keep Bitcoin as the real Bitcoin in the view of their investor.
S2X would only succeed if they turn ALL major Bitcoin processor (tool used to buy stuff online with bitcoin) to S2X. Bitcoin holds value as an investment but also has a token to buy goods. If you can't buy good with S2X does it worth something? 
If someone invest 100k$ in Bitcoin he's not looking for fast and instant transaction he's just looking for a token that is backup by the people and community. S2X is backed by "hashrate" and nothing more. The beauty of bitcoin is that if we can hold through the storm the difficulty will adjust reflecting the network hashrate and thing will be like it was before.
Will the value drop ? YES for sure when people start to sell a shake-off will happen and the weak will follow cashing out. The smart will Cash out at the top of the peak and will try to call the bottom.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:57:13

you know what, the whole situation is such a fucking cluster fuck that I would not risk, keeping my bitcoin on exchange during the fork. I would ONLY if the exchange have a clear decisive way to deal with the fork and most of them are blurry about it.

Be sure to remember that bitcoin is not a safe even from taxes in many countries. Be sure to file the proper paper when you "cashout" if you decide to go down this road.
A lot of people regret (including me) to have sold our bitcoin in the past  and not buying as much as we could at 300-500-900 etc.. it's always like that. I Regret not buying more last week at 7200CND... it's at 9471$ right now... FUCK ME RIGHT?
BUT BUT I never buy more than what I am whiling to lose, the elephant in the room with bitcoin is that we are on a ship to an unknow destination and we are sailing in the fog. Is the ship going to hit an iceberg at somepoint and sink ? or it's going to be smooth sailing for a while? dunno, don't care I am holding and waiting for six figures after that I'll see if I don't start spending a little bit and hold for seven.

@_date: 2017-09-07 16:34:12
The value is in the code, the hashrate, the devs and the community. Not in the Token aka bitcoin.
Peoples believe on the value because the system is been holding. Right now with Segwit and Soon (tm) lightning network the system keeps improving in the right direction (in my opinion). 
But if the system starts to clunk up, getting slower, no development anymore... would you think that it will hold the same value ? People would have the same belief ? 
That's what is "backing" bitcoin a strong network that bring value to the token.
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:56:57
Well when I want to sign into GDAX the SSL certificate is owned by Coinbase and the [GDAX logo]( at the top of the login form redirect to coinbase.
If you have the right beta phase, it would scale up properly I don't think this would be a problem. I think most of the people of starts exchange have no idea what they are getting into. 
This is basically an online banking service/stock broker service, that need to handle a lot of traffic. But in 2017 with cloud computing there is no reason to have downtime when you can do instant resources scaling with Amazon Cloud. 
If you get more transaction / traffic you should get more from the transaction fees you charge, and be able to hire the amount of employees you need. With bitcoin they need to be able to manage the unpredictable because that's what every single market on the planet is and bitcoin is no different to some extend.
Circle was an awesome service and when they "Partnered" with Coinbase you would think that Coinbase would had been smart enough to dig into their tech and how they do things transaction wise....

It's your coins do whatever you want with it.
If you want my REAL advice hold them, I will not put that in the meme term HODL, because im dead serious... 
I sold 68 BTC at 13$cnd a couple years ago because I needed the money and it was the easy way to "cash out". 
Sold around 40 ish at the MtGOX "crash" (look where we at now)... do the math yourself, if I had kept all my coins right now.... So yeah do what ever you want with your coins in my honest opinion for the few fraction of a BTC I got right now... im holding either to the moon or to the ground.

You REALLY think that china will ban ALL exchanges ? I think not, there is not much money being moved and profit made via exchange to close everything down.

Bank will start having Bitcoin ATM with wallets that they will manage, they will charge you between 2% and 4% to use the ATM. Then they will give you a 5%-6% interest rate if you leave your bitcoin at the bank.
Bank will start to hire "crypto professional" to play the bitcoin market like stock market and will rake the high return on bitcoin. This will be a win win for them because they don't have to invest in bitcoin and they will make money off it.
The bad thing is that people will get small return on the real bitcoin market. The good thing is that it remove the "hard part" of dealing with exchanges for the average user and will bring more money in bitcoin.

Right now I don't even own a full bitcoin but it's what I own and I slowly buying my way back to 1 full bitcoin that's my short term goal right there.

Well I don't think that this leak is a systemic risk... I don't see Equifax collapsing tomorrow, remember the target leak 70 million costumers information... Sure Equifax is double that but they will have to do a settlement.
It always depend on the nature of the information leaked to be honest.
I don't see the link between systemic and Compartmentalized? 
Maybe you're talking database wise? Since Compartmentalized information is basically when you're leaving everyone in the dark limiting information access to each pieces of the big picture.
You can do that in database and limit access per users to certain tables or parts. The best way to protect user data like that is encryption and a 2FA with a special off the grid usb dongle that generate keys every X amount of time.

LocalBitcoin connects peoples to each other bypassing exchanges, so people can trade and to hand bitcoin for money. It's not a loophole but will last longer than many exchanges.
I am not 100% sure about that but I think that localbitcoin have less influence on the bitcoin price than exchanges, that would explain bitcoin going sideways rather than plummeting even if everyone dumps on LB
If the website is hosted outside china I guess they could just use the great firewall of china to block it, but bitcoin always finds a way.

The PROBLEM is that, there is nothing wrong in my opinion with raising block sizes. BUT... BUT, not right now and not with an half botched solution with no replay protection. 
The network is not congested right now and wont be for a while there is plenty of space in Segwit. At some point bigger block will be needed but not right now.

who knows? keep an eye on it, it says that it will go from 5k CND to 3.2k in the next two days.
I have no idea how they analyse the market, do they use keyword + news or purely numbers base on previous trends... 
One thing sure is that claiming that BTC will go up in the next months / years... is also a safe bet if you look at the pass.
Truth to be told nobody knows... bitcoin is not a corporation or a stock. Theres is no annual analysis on sales or new product release stuff like that. It's the same good tech that keeps getting updated, some will agree with the change and some will not. 
Drama will always be in the forecast (see chain split BCH) and this will always cause some small dips.

With Segwit and soon LN there is no reason for 2x or for big blocks... 
This is only a strategy to put the blockchain and nodes in the hands of big corporations and centralize all the nodes. With this step they will be able to push anything in the core development.
THE ESSENCE of the blockchain is to have a decentralized network and let the network decide what is best as for protocol and have a say in it.
If no one is able to run nodes and you need a super expensive infrastructure to run simple nodes that goes against everything that bitcoin stands for.
right now the blockchain take around [158.48GB]( 
09-26-13 (10.66GB) to 09-25-14 (23.27GB) = 11.22GB for one year
09-25-14 (23.27GB) to 09-29-15 (45.18GB) = 21.88 GB for one year
09-26-15 (45.18GB) to 09-26-16 (84.10GB) = 38.92 GB for one year 
09-26-16 (84.10GB) to 09-25-17 (134.19GB) = 50 GB for one year
Right now we get an increase of 1.5% per year on average... and segwit is only what 4% of transactions ? Segwit tansaction are Max of 4Mb on average takes 1.6mb. Right now average block is 900kb.... it went from 100kb to 900kb in 5 YEARS. 
Right now around 259,800 transaction per day in last 24hours 
148 block 
6 blocks per hours
1804 transaction per blocks
10 825 transaction per hours
259 800 transaction per 24 hours
8204 transaction per blocks
49249 transaction per hours
1 181 980 transaction per days
Even if we would MAX out 4mb you get a LOT more transaction... right now we are FAR FAR FAR away from the adaptation rate to full all of these. Why rush into something that would in 5 years or so make the blockchain increase to 3-5TB of data per year ?

1. No you can buy cash via LocalBitcoin ( HIGH RISK )

3. Always depend what is your goal with bitcoin;
Online wallet (you mean keep your coin on an exchange?) NEVER
Buy a little bit and spend it after a small profit --&gt; phone wallet
Buy a lot of bitcoin overtime and hold---&gt; paper wallet or hardware wallet.
4. READ A LOT about it.

There is not enough places where you can buy stuff with BTC right now, internationally .

Its possible only if you keep your bitcoin and don't sell them like I did -___- XD
Since bitcoin is dividable you can own a fraction of a bitcoin and have a substantial amount of value one day. Who know maybe one day you'll be able to pay a house with 0.001 BTC or maybe you wont be able to buy a candy at the corner store.
So OP investment of 100$ is a "Gamble" because know one knows for sure what is in for Bitcoin. But so fare the future is bright country like Japan that recognized the value of bitcoin and India that is having fair discussion on it. 
Only big countries like Canada,US and China that drown in Capitalism are scared of bitcoin. Having a clear cut opinion on bitcoin jeopardize their precious fiat. They prefer riding the fence on bitcoin and letting things go for now because people are still spending money on BTC and getting paid in fiat.
The day that more and more people will start getting paid in BTC rather than fiat. The day that people starts spending BTC for everyday goods on regular basis the hammer might come down hard and fast...

Personally I think it's one more step towards good regulation and our general protection. The approval is province per province in this specific case but the regulation makes it easier for other provinces to approve such project. It's a solid ground to legitimate bitcoin for the public opinion and brushing away the "specter of darkness shady bitcoin".
It's the first step in the recognition of value first of all, if value recognition is generalized among many governments it will mean protection against event like the MtGox. 
Mean that people will be more at ease to invest in bitcoin like a stock option and legitimize the value of it.
Regulation could means something like an international accord on anti-trust type of action by big miner corporations. Since Bitcoin is viewed as a border-less/international "currency" at some point everyone will have to come together and agrees that an "hijack" of the hashrate is a possible option. 
We saw news of country like [Russian]( and other places that want to start mining bitcoin backed by government fund. If you think that jihan is a problem right now think twice when a country with a GPD of 1283.20 billion U.S dollar starts thinking about investing in bitcoin mining...
They could go by the present bitcoin core but try to force a hardfork into a bigger better hashrate network and promise a lot of stuff then once people are locked in the new fork, dev their own core with regulation in it. People might think that's a thin foil hat view on everything but if a few devs with "limited" money caused a hardfork to BCH I don't see how hard it would it be for a country to do it...
Net neutrality might be a problem right now but think twice our net neutrality will come some day or another. People are always comparing bitcoin to the internet of the 90's and how young it is. In the 90's nobody were even close to think about something like net neutrality. Internet was the free world no one was giving a shit, there was no money to make with the internet other than what the ISP were charging for your access.
I don't know if my rambling makes sens but this is my 2cents about it, government recognition is good and liberal guidelines is even better.

It sad to say but a lot of exchange have no reputation to defend like big corporations, so they act like that and they are not really held accountable for their lack of support...
There is so few of them that they can and will do it, here in Canada I can buy safely from Cadrigacx, Coinbase and Kraken I believe... thats pretty much it, so choose your lesser evil I guess...

Well maybe not the World War 3, but seeing a lot of big country investing in mining it's the first sign that bitcoin is gaining a lot of legitimacy.

Everyone talking about exponential GROWTH but it's only happening in the PRICE of bitcoin, not in the number of transactions. from 800 to 1800 in two years you are not DOUBLING every years.... 800-&gt;1600-&gt;3200
we are going 900(2015)-&gt;1500(2016)-&gt;1800-2000(2017)
even if we DOUBLE next year 4000 and again next 8000 we still have the space in segwit. SSooo it gives us TWO YEARS to find a better solution or fine tune Segwit2x with replay protection or finalizing LN... why rush this to November???

STORY TIME; I sold 68 bitcoins at 13$ back in the days, now they would had been worth 385 356$. I regret it right now, but at the time I answer yes to the first question. I was in need bitcoin bailed me out of a bad pinch. Thanks bitcoin you saved my ass.

Well if you look at the post there is a 1.5% grow of the block chain over the past years an that's an average. The block chain grow is in direct relation with the data put in the blocks. 
If you check at each block transaction size for the past two years they never broke 1mb (except today gorsh damn it trying to fool my logic)...
1mb ~ 2k transaction per block, its not because that the price of bitcoin is GROWING that we have more market penetration or more adoption, yes there is a relation between the two. But if everyone single bitcoin is in HODL (HERP DERP) mode and there is NO ONE wiling to sell them, the price will sky rocket. That does not represent more adoption it's just law of the market offer and demand.
So do not mistake the price of bitcoin going up with exponential ADOPTION. Because the number of transaction per block is not growing exponentially. We have been around 1700-2k transaction per block for the past year... 
But if you look at the price from 600USD to 4387USD (today) it might look like exponential growth. The reality is that people are hording bitcoin and no one is willing to sell them for cheap anymore. Why? Because YES there is more people accepting bitcoin for goods BUT we are far far away from exponential ADOPTION.
Again this is my two cents on the matter, maybe I am wrong, maybe I am somehow right?

I did the ["math"]( like 5 days ago and since no one linched me on it I assume that I was in the ball park. From my own opinion and point of view there is plenty of space in the segwit block increase to accommodate a lot more transactions

I've dealed with Cavirtex for a year I NEVER had problems with them, all my transaction were smooth.
Now for the question can we Trust them again? 
Well having a pretty e-mail telling me that they got acquired by some New-York firm. They will have to answer question about what really happen when the DB leaked and what measures they took to make sure it will not happen again.
They sent a pretty email and everything but they are not telling us if our debit card are still working. If our past infos are REALLY safe, I think the whole shift have been handle poorly...
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:48:33
There might no place in small market for bitcoin ? Maybe the good use of bitcoin right now starts at 100$ + ? 
Maybe in the future there will be a market for 5$ transaction with little to no fees ? I don't think by abandoning bitcoin and not working to make a solid core/chain system is the solution here.
I got nothing against other cryptos but truth to be told, if they are smart they should work around bitcoin and developing strong off chains solution to support it. 
Everything was in the red a week ago because of the little panic sell... Not only bitcoin but all other cryptos, I guess the story here is well a live and die by the bitcoin mood.
Make any variable of ANY type of blockchains or coins, anything you want. Right now you only hear in the media about bitcoin and 5 to 10% is ETH the rest is just dust in the wind....
I am not a pro advocate of bitcoins I don't have all my life saving into bitcoins. But that's just the reality right now...

As for your coins it's a really dumb idea to buy bitcoins and let coinbase hold them. Not your key not your coins, if coinbase had to close down tomorrow or get hacked and your coins are not safe you might lose them all...
Please people be smart with your bitcoins and other cryptocoins and don't host them on exchange sites.

You can buy on coinbase if you feel like they are not giving you a good service. 
Personally I emailed them about a problem yesterday they answered today and I had a really quick and fast exchange of 5 or 6 email with them during the day.

One person = one miner - a small fraction of hashing power.
If you're one person that owns thousand of mining machine you're still a one miner with a LOT of hashing power...
let's say that someone achieve ALONE 90% of the ecosystem hashing power, you're telling me that this person would become irrelevant because 10% of the hashing power decide to apply one set of rules that oppose you?
If the same miner spawn enough nodes and decide to set the rules ? you're telling that other small nodes would defeat them?

Better to contact the website, QuadricaGX used to have new addresses generated each time you wanted to deposit in your wallet. Once I reused one of my old addresses freaked out because I though the bitcoin would be in limbo but they got to their destination. 
Even if the address "expires" in 3hour they should be attached to your wallet... It would be the dumbest idea ever to have wallets that dies and expire... Each addresses are created from your private key and should be associated with it...

* Guy lives near a solar farm
Myth :

* Owning 25 miners ( plus the 100 extra one he ordered )
* Owning green houses build in china
* Having employees that he pays 20$ an hour 
* Running on 100% solar power
* Owning 375 batteries ( 25 miners, 15 bats per miner )

Good for you man, but if you want to ride this ride you'll have to learn how to HODL. 
I know it's easy to say, I don't know you finances and everything, but remember never buy more than what you're willing to lose.
Sell high and buy low if you want to make profit, for me I HODL to the moon or to the ground. I am ready to lose everything or to gain much more. 
I will tell you that back in the day I sold 68 Bitcoin out of panic because the price went from 20 to 12$ and I was freaking out. I used to own a couple hundred BTC. Some I sold because I was really in need of money to pay bills, some I sold because I was in panic. 
As of right now I don't even own a full bitcoin... because I sold everything at some point. 
Be smart, look at the market, look at the trends, read from both side of the fence, learn more about bitcoin and become an addict like most of us. :)

Bad troll is bad, but still let me ask you this:
What what about this? please explain me your view on this article? Because it's the most moronic shit I have laid my eyes on for a whiles. 
Starting from "Yeah bitcoin is a cult of hording and people are letting the "converted" spend and buy coins to drive up while the masterminds hoards them" to "Yeah have you think about the pollution and impact on environment?"
Ending with "Yeah I don't really know what bitcoin is" and with "Yeah it might be a ponzi scheme or a pyramid" 
It seems like the writer of this article have no idea what bitcoin is from the start and is particularly mad that he was not an early adopter. 
Also on the same note, he has no idea what a pyramid scheme is and you sure don't if you're offering one and linking that stupid article.

First if your .01BTC is worth 100$ at some point you cover your cost in two month, right now it's worth 28$ taught shit.
Second if at some point mining with 1TH Yields 0.005 BTC but the price of btc double or triple by the time your 1TH become "useless" you will still make money.
The shit that you don't seem to comprehend is that no matter the amount of BTC you get in output, bitcoin is always linked to a price.
If renting something for 150$ a month would output 100BTC a month but bitcoin is worth 25¢ a BTC. You would only get 25$ a month.... If you get 0.01 BTC this month and next month BTC double in price you just doubled you investment...
Its a fucking gamble, the same way that buying at 2800$ right now is a fucking gamble. BTC could tank tomorrow at 10$ a BTC and you're at a major lost and you would cry your fucking eye out like a baby (by your attitude).
But if you were to buy at 2800$ and tomorrow it sky rocket at 15 000$ You would think you're pretty smart and understand the whole fucking game.
Before calling something a SCAM, think with your little brain. By the way I have no affiliation with whatever mining company and I don't even mine myself. But before investing in such a deal I would be smart enough to understand the fucking basic before going wild on reddit calling everything a scam. 
Now again Shoo, go to bed and think about your behavior.
