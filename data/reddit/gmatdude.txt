I did peer lending with cash and made nothing on my money over two years due to people defaulting.

I have an interesting story about Vietnam and Bitcoin.  So I was living there from 2008-2012, and in 2011 and 2012, I started to get into online poker.  But all of my American cards kept getting declined and none of my Vietnamese cards worked either.  Had I been living in America, I would've been content to just go to a local poker room in California or to a casino or something.  So I was getting really annoyed -- couldn't play poker if my life depended on it.  
Did some research and came across "Bitcoin," this weird Internet currency that no government could control.  And at this time there were some really shitty online casinos that accepted Bitcoin.  So I used my American bank account to paypal a friend to go buy me some Bitcoin.  This was back when you could buy them via money orders and whatnot.  I remember buying like 30 of them for $200 -- something like that.  
Then I started playing online poker in these shitty online rooms with Bitcoin.  One tournament, I ended up winning something like 12 Bitcoin.  After a while, I moved back to the States and lost my interest in poker, but the interest remained for Bitcoin.  I still have many of those Bitcoins from my time in Vietnam.
So thank you Vietnam.  You're the only reason I was frustrated enough to even research alternatives!

I did peer-to-peer lending with Lendingclub.com as an experiment.  I deposited $500, loaning $25 each to 24 people.  
It was a disaster.  After two years, my effective interest rate was -2%.  Six of the 24 completely bailed on the loan and defaulted.  Three of 4 others settled for much less than was originally given.
So yeah.  Right now crowdfunding sucks.

I think your theory is a little extreme, but as a former expat who lived abroad for four years, you're not that far off lol.  Expats are weird and they only get weirder the longer they're gone.

That's always been my sentiment too. It's become a political message at this point.

Been holding since late 2011. For me, part of it is speculation and the hope I'll get rich or be able to buy a house. But the main reason I hold is because I believe in the vision and I respect what BTC is doing from an idealistic standpoint.

Here's the fee that I see on the Blockchain.
0.0000931 BTC
As you can see, it's very close to .0001.  So it will definitely come back to my Bitcoin client wallet if it never gets confirmed?

If it's pressing, I can transfer some coin from the Electrum wallet to the Bitcoin client wallet, but I'm unsure of how to use this "child" method you mentioned.
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:36:34
Unfortunately, this transaction emptied out the Bitcoin client wallet.

Which exchange allows me to do this?  Can I use Coinbase?

If I acquired Bitcoin in, let's say 2013, for $1,000 and I transfer said Bitcoin to Coinbase to sell in 2014 for $5,000, how on Earth would they know what i acquired the Bitcoin for originally?  Wouldn't it say just a gain of $5,000, but really it should be $4,000 right?

Thank you for the detailed reply. Is there another way to rectify this or is this the only way?

$6, still holding
