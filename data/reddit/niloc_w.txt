NYT with a premium clickbait tagline
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:22:04
I don't necessarily disagree with you guys. But the tribalism on both sides is ridiculous and offputting 
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:27:53
Why does this have any upvotes? 
This is a poorly written article, it's misguided, and is concluded with a flimsy CTA to some other investment guide we're supposed to check out. 
Also, is the title a question? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:37:23
This is a borderline ebook, thank you
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:21:41
That sure beats finding a 20 in an old coat.

You're right it's not out of the realm of possibility, it just feels unlikely to me. And by that logic, it seems coins like Monero would be a bigger target.
But it's hard to say what will happen if the US were to lose a good percentage of its ability to economically attack or starve its enemies. 
Big clashes with government are undoubtedly coming, and if 2018 is the year the US does something drastic... I'll be the first to admit I was wrong.

An outright ban would shift innovation away from the US. The promise of crypto/blockchain is out of the bag and the US cannot afford to be left completely out of the party. I think regulators know that. 
The time for banning it would've been in the Silk Road days, those have come and gone. I see little reason why 2018 would be the time authorities backtrack on their position. Any specific grounds for your 50% guess?

Agree with Timknows, there is some other reason this happened. How long from when you started trying to contact them did you conclude they'd stolen from you?

I think watermelon is highly overrated, it's not even in the top 30. there I said it
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:06:21
Well said. Amazing how quickly people get attacked and the same is true on most of the crypto fb groups I'm in. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:48:29
Terrible idea

Coinbase is making a killing right now
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:46:06
Around 50k. But we'll see how long that first-mover advantage holds out. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:19:16
yes, you can read bout it here

Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill!

Solid post, thanks for a dose of sanity. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:56:03
Not one I'm a consistent listener of, thanks for pointing it out. I'll update the list to reflect that.

When's the ICO? I bet he raises 30 million at least
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:49:49
A heavy-handed attempt at satire
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:17:33
Yum_Kaax hits the nail on the head. But assuming that we all can't be Zen masters, I think you're lamenting the loss of idealism or at least distraction from it. 
Vitalek was right on when he questioned if crypto had "earned it" when the overall market cap passed .5T. "How many unbanked have been banked? How much censorship-free commerce has been enabled?"
I'd also like to see more focus on some of these elements and fewer people simply running in with dollar signs in their eyes.

Even though you may have missed out on the big move in the last few years or even months/weeks, it was a big move off of a very low base and this industry is still in its infancy relative to where it could go in the next 5-10 years. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:32:04
Right, but how would one confirm what the current "order" is? The Bloomberg article appears to be based off one guy from AQR Capital.
Agreed, people get blinded by novelty and don't see the potentially insidious side of new things.

I like bad crypto too, most podcasts can't touch these guys in terms originality
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:22:44
Don't agree with OP necessarily but it would be great if we could get people as fired up about solving environmental problems as they are about cashing in on crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:05:46
Can't tell if this is legit. If it is, the lack of empathy is disturbing. If not, a pathetic effort at manipulation. A sh*t sandwich really...now I remember why I stayed off Reddit for years.

If you click on to "see the statements of Polish and international institutions" it gets worse. 
Propaganda masquerading as a PSA.

Those who scream hodl on a hair trigger are equally annoying I'd say. But I hear you. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:39:21
Hodl until I'm dead, got it.

Your post reminded me of this - 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:54:44
yea, when someone says they "look back on the last 6 months and don't remember any of the good moments" - I'd say there are some issues. Interesting nonetheless.

Can't wait for the ChangCoin ICO
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:20:15
Hadn't heard of that one, I'll have to check it out
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:44:15
I also thought decentralized currency was meant to hold some promise of a more level playing field (not direct redistribution)... you know, devoid of bankers, government and all that.
The Onion nailed it as usual: 
"Bitcoin On Path To Functioning Just Like Real Currency After Small Concentration Of People Acquire Majority Of It"
@_date: 2019-03-26 09:17:20
tl;dr Google search values exert significant influence on Bitcoin returns, particularly in the short run. Google search values have some influence on the trading volumes of cryptocurrencies, although results fall just short of statistically significant benchmarks.

No, that quote is from his Twitter handle. I took it as a bit tongue in cheek but I haven't listened to his show to be able to accurately judge.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:01:43
Noded is not one I'd heard of before, thanks 
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:00:31
Yes, as I mentioned it was hard to cut the list down. I like the "babe ruth of bitcoin shills" though
@_date: 2018-04-27 06:30:58
Succinct. Good information - thanks
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:58:36
Regardless of what happened in the case of this hack, all of these are great reminders. Thanks for sharing
