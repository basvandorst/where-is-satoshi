I think I didn't make my example clear: this is not an investigation on state corruption - it's an investigation on private corporations corruption. The state is trying its best in order to avoid the disappearance of funds, and wants to take this money back.

I didn't really understand your point... I obviously do not enjoy "journalists having their money seized" as an argument, but seizing money IS an investigation practice that needs to be continued.

I'm sorry, but what you presented is not actually a solution. You're literally saying that we should change the power structure (and coercion) in society as a whole, instead of focusing on a very specific problem (not structural) I pointed out about bitcoin. I'm sorry because it looks like I'm saying you're WRONG, and this is NOT THE CASE. I like bitcoin, I defend it, but I cannot get past some specific problems that can be structural in the future...

"Panic" implies irrational, "weak" is self explained. They are derrogatory imho.
Of course I just mean that because we are using labeling words _against_ people. The concepts in themselves are not "good" nor "bad".

You said idea and thing, but classified bitcoin as an "invention".
As it stands, yet, bitcoin is an idea. Just like a law. 
Also, this positivistic and functionalist approach to look at a phenomenon hurts more than it helps.
Bitcoin is a currency, it serves just as well as an idea as a thing. It's just not being responsibly used.

Allow me to make a metaphor to illustrate what you might have missed in this post :) 
"gods laws are useful and usable in large scale, they are just not being used. Damn these faithless laws."

It's difficult to see the underlying nature of a post, but I felt a lot of fear in strong worded posts. "Great price drop! I'm buying" (by the way, you should too)".

I could never hate grammar ;)
Regarding the lack of oversight and regulation, I did not mean to say SEC or FED or any _institution_. I meant the complete lack of any regulation (even self-regulation). Saying that the market is "self-regulating", in this case, is erroneous. Markets don't self-regulate (as it is impossible for a non-personal, amorphous, non-self-aware entity to regulate itself), people (self)regulate markets. If it's in the interest of the people, bitcoin markets should be behaving a certain way - as it stands now, the market is being attacked, causing huge losses and fingerpointing.

By all means use these words. They are not, and never should be, exclusive to a group of people. It just strucks me as unexpected when people negatively label a group (some group, some subgroup) with derrogatory words and then appear to be tranquil and relaxed. I sense a lot of fear and protection behind these words - of course this does not mean that you are using them in the same way I feel them being used :)

Exactly my point. Gold is also faith based, but it has real world use (even if reduced in the us). Even oil is faith based, and can support a currency.

I'm sorry if I sounded arrogant or something close to that... There are advantages in owning bitcoins that also provide good insights about this current price drop. I just meant that a lot of the community is so heavily tied to the market (that means: having bitcoins in their wallets) that all new posts right now are people blaming others (using mtgox, being weak hands, etc).

Backing investments, SOME currencies (hence the "even if reduced in the us"), and a organizational and international promise that it will hold some intrinsic value. Even the irrelevant promise that you can make jewelry out of it,

There's no decimals that can protect an entire economy if bitcoins get overvalued.
While its nerd-gold, it's fine. We are talking about world-wide business adoption. 8 decimals are irrelevant.
