Most major banks are publicly traded and significantly owned by pension systems and endowments. In reality, it's people saving for retirement that own the banks.

I think it has more to do with the fact that it's easier to launder money through bitcoin cause there's less regulation/oversight/etc than fiat. 
There are lots and lots of laws/regulators/checks/tests/audits of fiat currency to prevent money laundering. 
Bitcoin doesn't have that as much (yet). 
That's why

The problem with people saying send them to jail is that there can be lots of people involved in something like this without evening knowing about it. Also there can be senior people who had no idea about it. To make blanket statements about jailing the CEO is stupid. The CEO can't and will never know what all employees are doing at all times. 
Then you have junior people that may have opened accounts at their bosses instructions and they should definitely not go to jail. 
It's hard to find the ring leader so to speak in these scenarios but when they do and they have solid evidence, those people go to jail. You don't always hear about it but it happens.

These charts and infographics I've been seeing on this sun have been all based on flawed logic in an attempt to make bitcoin seem like something to not. 
Comparing Pokémon go to commercial flights is a stupid comparison and doesn't even make sense. I would hope that something as complicated as a commercial flight wouldn't be adopted within 19 days. 
Tldr these comparisons are flawed and meaningless and it would be great to get rid of them and focus on content that will actually help bitcoins cause

This chart, along with a bunch of others that keep getting posted on this sub, are based in flawed logic or cherry picking.
