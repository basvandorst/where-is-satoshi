That's silly... You can't base ALL taxation by piggybacking on consumption and hoping you will make what you are supposed to. The cost of everything would skyrocket. People would then buy their stuff from overseas, and the government would collect nothing. Have you ever taken any sort of economics class?

Bitcoin has an even lower market cap in reality... I'd estimate at least a good 20% percent of the bitcoin to be gone, lost or deleted. My gut feeling would say even 50%, but it's hard to estimate.

Thankfully we've got positive, motivated people to help it grow.

No way dude. 6 months could get them to a pretty solid place. Count the summertime, a little more screwing around, a little more trying things out. People will be using it to buy gifts on Christmas 2015.

...Yes? Ever used something like Expedia? Amazon?

Dude. No. There are no hard rules to Bitcoin. It's a living piece of code that gets updated all the time. Bitcoin is a 6 years old piece of software. There are no dogmas. No constitution. Only consensus counts. Calm down.

I am calm. Am I not calm? Do I not seem calm? I can assure you I am super calm. Are you calm?

Good idea m8. Leave the enemy with the ability to print money. After they crush us, they will be riddled with debt! Ha, ha! What a cunning plan!
