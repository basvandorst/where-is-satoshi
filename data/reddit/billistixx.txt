In and incline you get cool video games and a lot of food options but what you do doesn't matter a whole lot.
In the decline of a civilization everything you do matters.

Then everyone knows and then that's when America strikes up a war against uh... that guy or... uuh.. them! Doesn't work this time because Russia moved to gold and the dollar sinks like a stone.
Then you grab your cold storage and leave your home because everyone you told to get Bitcoin now knows you're the richest person they know and they want a piece of it.

Well I also replied below as well:
Well there were rumblings in early summer about a financial crash being inevitable, when there was speculation people in forums said nothing would happen in the summer, financial crashes happen in October and November.
I'm a fan of seasons. What's more interesting to you? Living in the incline of a civilization or the decline? We could be in a position to experience both.
In and incline you get cool video games and a lot of food options but what you do doesn't matter a whole lot.
In the decline of a civilization everything you do matters.
Also, slaves like us tend to do better after revolutions.

Nice to see you didn't edit that.


Once you've worked for the CIA you never leave. Snowden works for the highest bidder just like everyone else.
If the CIA offered to pay you a bunch of money to fuck over the NSA, would you say no? Especially when you know the CIA are waaaay more powerful. 
The CIA is INTERNATIONAL, that's why Snowden is in Russia, he's a favor. The CIA got to lean on something with Russia, they cut a deal, America looks away on some things they get some money...
The NSA is national, internal to the US, they'd have a hard time reaching snowden in Russia.
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:24:27

There's a business in here somewhere. Maybe some kind of porn kickstarter where a pornstar posts their pitch of the kind of porno they want to do and how many bitcoins it'll cost to shoot it and users pony up the coins for it.

Maaaan.... it's fucked up. The fact that it's open is the tricky thing. If it were bitcoin started by the government and all the mining was done on only their servers something would be fishy.

If they sold all the bitcoins they'd get whatever they'd get from the auction which would make them money, after they make their money why would they give a fuck? You think if they auctioned them all off at once someone wouldn't bid close to the value?
Also the government is controlled by the Fed and bitcoin concerns the fed so the fed would easily use the government to fuck with bitcoin.

Worst captain in Starfleet history:
Q reluctantly agrees to make Quinn human if he is granted asylum. He later attempts to bribe Janeway, claiming that if she rules against Quinn, he'll send Voyager home.
While trying to decide where to assign Quinn so that he will not use his knowledge to evolve humanity overnight, Janeway and Chakotay receive a message from the Doctor that Quinn is dying after ingesting a poison. Q then appears and admits that he was the one who gave Quinn the poison. He's taking up Quinn's rebellion against the staid order of the Q.

Who'd they get the money from? Maybe the same place they get the weapons? Where'd those guys get the weapons from? defense contractors?

Yeah, Israeli moon bases, bases on mars. Reptilians is kind of a stretch. Fake moon. The false moon landing thing. I don't know, I could see the US government pulling a wag the dog on people and make Russia think they're superior. Bermuda Triangle I'm not big on. Atlantis I'm not big on. Don't believe in Big Foot or Loch Ness.

Considering mr ipad chain already has his hat and shoes deal going on. Developing an app is a lot of work and he would probably have to take on developers.
But a site that's focused on content, reviews of artists that take bitcoin, etc. That's something he could have running in a day.
Then at least he'd have a platform that he could then use to promote an app he gets involved with.
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:59:42
Mr. iPad Chain has the right idea. Smoke some weed and chill.

Funny thing is, not everyone knows that, it's not exactly information the media repeats over and over.
"Asked by reporters to establish his authenticity to ensure he is not some fantasist, he laid bare, without hesitation, his personal details, from his social security number to his CIA ID and his expired diplomatic passport. There is no shiftiness. Ask him about anything in his personal life and he will answer."
Ok, so his social security number which is current, his EXPIRED diplomatic passport but when it comes to his CIA ID they don't say it's expired, funny how they wrote it like that.
Also, everyone knows when you join the CIA you never really leave the CIA. Snowden may have gotten a job with the NSA and the CIA said "Hey, we could probably offer that Snowden guy a bunch of money to help us out." everyone has their price.


You'd think after working for Russia's Facebook he would have had SOME money to fix his glasses, we can see how much is in his bitcoin account.


You've provided no proof to give me a reason to believe otherwise.


Tell it to William Binney.


 Can't bring me down, can't break my stride. I know it's hard for you to believe that the media is lying to you, but it's the truth. Open your eyes.
If you support Snowden so much, why don't you give me proof otherwise?
Don't you think it's weird that they haven't released any more info? It's because it's an op. A limited hang out.

Having Bitcoin all of a sudden available as a means of payment in all their stores wouldn't just happen over night, there's infrastructure that needs to roll out.

Bitcoins are backed by energy. It took electricity and expensive hardware to generate them. Plus time on people's part to work on that hardware/software.
You could probably figure out an average cost to generate a bitcoin through electricity and be able to assign bitcoin an evaluation based on that.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:19:13
Not for new users and not for a couple of weeks now.
I had my account setup really early, I was in the beta 10 dollars in BTC for free set.
I believe something happened and regulators in Canada got scared. They allow people who are already approved to keep buying but anyone new is told to pound sand.
Maybe things will go back to normal next week, people coming back from vaycay, that sort of thing.
But as of now circle isn't replying to people who are emailing them and asking if they can send in a scan of their drivers licenses (I know 2 people personally) and at the price Bitcoin is at I don't imagine Circle will be gunning to approve anyone right now.

Ever wonder why Snowden seems to target r/bitcoin? 
Like why was "Snowden documentary 'Citizenfour' nominated for Oscar" on the front page of r/bitcoin?
Don't you think it's possible Snowden could try to poster boy for bitcoin and then next thing you know there's a bunch of child porn on his computer?
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:29:54


That info was already released by William Binney. Who did not get the sweetheart treatment by the public/media. Snowden got the sweetheart treatment because the CIA allowed the media to release information and write "cool" stories about Snowden.
Why? Because the NSA was getting everyone's info stored on computers and the CIA doesn't.


Yep, a political favor.


They know he's CIA, Russia is doing a favor for America, they'll get a favor in return.

@_date: 2014-12-12 01:14:29


No, they've named themselves Buttcoin(ers) so they're making a mockery of Bitcoin itself. The Daily Hash Rate doesn't call Bitcoin "Shitcoin" on their site whenever they refer to it.

More so than the Sasquatch community which is what I thought ozone63 was talking about. As in I'm not worried about the Sasquatch community dissing bitcoin as much as I am Joe Rogan dissing it.
@_date: 2015-07-20 03:55:59
Joe Rogan will turn on Bitcoin on a dime. Remember how he loved the Sasquatch community? Now he shits on them and basically calls them retards.
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:47:32
'Tools for the future', he knows that means something else to people right?
@_date: 2015-07-20 04:27:49
Joe Rogan is the xfactor here, imagine one day Joe Rogan decides he doesn't really understand bitcoin and he's tried but he doesn't totally grasp it, he probably has a bit of money in Bitcoin but probably under $100 bucks, Bitcoins given to him by some guests he's had like Andreas, no real investment.
He then has an old comic on the show, someone like Dom Irrera and Joe Rogan (who hasn't really seen any traction in the price or anything) and all of a sudden the topic of Bitcoin comes up and Joe asks Dom if he'd take it to work a gig, Dom replies that he's old school and can't make heads or tales of this Bitcoin shit and then calls it shitcoin.
Joe Rogan finds this funny, then piles on "Yeah, it is a dumb idea! I mean I got money in my pocket, why do I need this shit?"
Now he's said it, now there's no going back. Now whenever bitcoin comes up Joe just regurgitates Dom's line to try to seem old school and funny. Since Joe thinks it's uncool of a sudden, everyone in the Roganverse agrees with him and all of a sudden more people have a bad opinion.

Yeah, ledger wallet for cold storage, phone for walk around.

Lederwallet isn't exactly a bank breaker...

Except magic cards are physical and cannot be easily passed over a per-existing network. Bitcoin can spread over night because of the nature of the internet.

Bitcoin isn't backed by a government, traditional fiat is. If fiat collapses because governments made bad decisions Bitcoin will be a safe haven.

Everyone knows no one leaves the CIA.


What about his character, being cool with joining the NSA after seeing that bit from Good Will Hunting? What an asshole.


Nope. Maybe it's different for you, you might live in a world where you know lots of CIA agents. Most people don't.

Did you know Israel stole their uranium for their nukes from the US?
*"The CIA believed that Israel's first bombs may have been made with highly enriched uranium stolen in the mid-1960s from the U.S. Navy nuclear fuel plant operated by the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation, where sloppy material accounting would have masked the theft."*
How fucked up is that?

**You didn't ask!**
A former system administrator for the **Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)** and a counterintelligence trainer at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), he later worked for the private intelligence contractor Dell inside an NSA outpost in Japan.
    "Asked by reporters to establish his authenticity to ensure he is not some fantasist, he laid bare, without hesitation, his personal details, from his social security number to his **CIA ID** and his expired diplomatic passport. There is no shiftiness. Ask him about anything in his personal life and he will answer."
Odd that they didn't say his CIA ID was expired... They lumped it in with his CURRENT social security number.
How come in all the photos he's been in his glasses have a broken missing nose piece? It's because he's an op, it's because he's a brand.
Even in the recent Wired cover:
This is a guy who watched this:
Then said "I'm in!"
And everyone thinks he's super cool even though William Binney blew the lid on everything a long time ago. Where's his coverage? Oh right, he didn't get any because he didn't have CIA backing.

They don't really say that, they basically just say you shouldn't have bought when it was high like they told you to and that you'll be able to buy it for cheap when no one cares about it.
They don't say no one will ever care about it again.
