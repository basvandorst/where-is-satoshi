Excellent. I saw a local, highly-regarded trader, and the local phone was listed, so, I thought, yeah, maybe... but being "new" I'm not interested in burning bridges right off the get-go. Thank you.

I've been to the LocalCoins site numerous times, it thinks I'm in Kansas or somewhereelse at least a thousand miles from me. Two days ago I stumbled upon some other site that had all kinds of people/groups who would meet at any Starbucks in the SF Bay Area to exchange BTC for cash. Like an idiot, I lost the web addy for the site... So, now, I'm really stuck
I keep seeing places (such as on LocalCoins) where they have exchange rates for gift cards-to-BTC that are totally insanely high. I mean, ten times the going rate. So, I'm seriously leery of these people. 
I have a starbucks card that I can anonymously add whatever cash I want to it, just down the street at a Walgreen's, so a card-for-coin deal would be perfect. It's a reloadable card, I've used it for multiple annual deals for VPNs, etc. But where?

Thank you... very much. It seems obvious, but, when one is "new" everything is new. Thanks again

I'll look into the Amazon deal. I went into a Walgreen's a few weeks ago and bought a Starbucks card, and put 300$ on it. Used most of it to buy VPN services... and it's refillable, in any amount. pretty handy. But I'll check to see if Amazon has higher denomination cards. CostCo, quite a while ago, had tons of different cards that were fixed amounts, but sold at a discount. No more, they really cut back on all that. Thanks for the tip. 
I'd taken a look at but it seemed a bit flaky. I saw a few "meet-in-person" deals that seemed pretty cool, but none anywhere's nearby at all. still... I'll check it out more, also.

The only thing that spooks me about that site is the Online Wallet part. I already setup an Electrum wallet in python over here.

Thanks. I need to use cash-based gift cards (in other words, cards that are bought with cash, no paper trail) and Amazon doesn't do cash deals to buy their cards. I checked purse out and for now their servers are down. I'll have a look later to see if they have alternatives, but they seem amazon-centric somehow. Hard to know that for sure until I can get access, of course.
