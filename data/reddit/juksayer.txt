@_date: 2014-11-06 19:32:09
Yeah my first attempt didn't go through. I think I've got it working now. Cheers.
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:33:40
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:55:52
ughh. ill figure it out. wonder what im doing wrong
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:45:41
Use it to help kids get textbooks or something but not stripper poles. I'm OK with the tank idea
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:42:50
Hey guys, newb here.
if anyone sees this, could someone tell me how to transfer my bits from changetip over to coinbase?
thanks for your time, sorry if this is the wrong place
edit; i figured it out!!! thanks everyone. this is awesome!!
@_date: 2014-11-03 01:27:27
I'd love to try this out? Can I give coins I collect here out in comment replies?
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:57:23
I won't forget either! 
So I can tip comments with what's in my changetip account, right?
This is so fucking cool.
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:38:04
Good luck man.
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:45:02
@_date: 2014-02-19 14:38:25
Thus nameth the trick
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:04:15
so is MS going to be holding these coins or are they converting to USD immediately?  
what would the outcome of both options be? 
 I'm under the impression that this is good news whether they keep or convert.
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:43:02
I thought dogebot was banned in this sub. If you don't get a comment reply, will the bot send a pm?
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:43:35
Confirmed works! Awesome. You were my first, flappy.
@_date: 2014-08-07 06:48:34
Its a better scam than the Federal reserve

Well, almost errthang

Errthang in moderation bro

This could be helpful to people who don't have insurance. If only using darknet didn't have a stigma.
Edit; It would take a pretty awesome doctor to take part in this. It's just so completely different from how people find doctors now. I think there was a site called coinmd that was similar but I don't remember if it was successful or not. I hope this gets more momentum.
@_date: 2015-04-11 18:56:53
Updates please.
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:28:32
glad you came to your senses
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:34:39

I can't wait until cyan releases their phone.

You can feed yourself? 
I need a binder full of women to feed me.

I'll suck all your dicks for a bit coin.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:48:38
buy when you're low, get high and sell the rest?
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:17:45
I'm not going to make a decision yet.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:14:27
Just because some professor told you what he thinks the definition of the word "sport" is, doesn't mean it can't include other competitive recreational games. Get off your high horse, you college douche

Pushing buttons on a keyboard or controller is physical. How is playing pong different than playing table tennis? How is playing Mario golf different from playing real golf? Its all subjective dude.  I think the downvoters are right.

I'm still able to earn some even with a disability case. Its been hard finding a job with a one year lapse in work due to an injury. Doesn't matter, still looking for work, will find something soon.

I wouldn't be surprised if someone buys a house with dogecoin. 
                                                                     A dogehouse
                                      Wow

Was that a signed picture of David hasselhoff in the bottom right?
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:07:53
Well they could be sports if people made them into competitions. And clearly if you Google "competitive handwriting" you'll get results where people would argue that handwriting can indeed be a sport.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:05:19
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:24:43
You should mention that to someone who has the power to do something about it.
@_date: 2013-12-31 14:34:04
Where's the surprise? We should assume that were being monitored at all times. This shouldn't stop you from trying to use bit coin on your iPhone.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:45:39
i would like to invite all of you over to @_date: 2013-11-25 01:39:48
