No problem! As far as we know, they don't collect a percentage. Apple isn't really involved in an applepay transaction, because the service is entirely on your device. So basically your iPhone is the middleman but apple isn't. The only risk factor is the banks.
The thing I like about applepay is that hypothetically if coinbase were to sign up for it in the same way that the credit card companies did, you could pay with bitcoin anywhere that applepay works.

Oh god, here we go again. Being here for a while, some advice I would give you is to sell for a price that you would be happy with now, don't hold because it isn't at a price you would be happy with tomorrow. Write a number on your wall. Tattoo it on your forehead. A lot of people could be much better off if they had taken this advice.
@_date: 2014-06-01 10:54:57
We are a long ways off from bitcoin potentially succeeding. Many bubbles will pop, the next one will end at a lower price than he bought in at. If he can hold for a couple years then good on him, but most hands aren't that steady and people get burned trying to cut their losses after a pop.

If anything it is a way to gauge the number of new people coming into the ecosystem. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 08:24:46


Yes, but in a way that would never produce an identical algorithm. The more different they are, the less of an advantage they have over FGPAs and GPUs because they can't be as specialized. This isn't something that exists now, and I don't see anyone needing to create it until the current forms of ASIC resistance stop working. Currently I think vertcoin would be the best if the n factor changed faster than every two years.
@_date: 2014-09-17 16:46:01
I would rather have someone like coinbase contract with apple to be in applepay in the same way that the banks are. There isn't any way that bitcoin could let paypal win against anyone else, nor would I want paypal to win against anyone else.

It is possible, but generally apple will ask you if you want to store encryption keys with them and they haven't mentioned it yet, so probably not. I mean it is possible apple is lying and your data is going straight to Nigeria, but it would be counter to their interests. If the government wants your purchase history they can already go to the bank and get it.

I don't want to be mean.. but why are you commenting on applepay without even knowing what it is?
Applepay is a system to securely store credit card information on the device, so instead of carrying around a bunch of cards and using them to pay, you just carry your phone and swipe it on the NFC reader. The NFC reader then gets no information about you aside from the money you wanted to send. It can also be used online in a similar fashion.
@_date: 2014-06-03 09:37:21
Makes absolute sense why they would want to do that. So they aren't held liable as having "sold" a currency.

The important thing here is that neither of the two widely held theories about Gox were actually the case.

The thing is, if someone wanted they could buy 3k BTC and drive the price to 670, just by targeting one exchange. They could split their buy across multiples and have an even lower effect on the market- but the important thing is for a single block, the alternative "stupidest decision possible" to buying from the auction wouldn't have that large an effect on the price. There is literally no way that anyone would pay 1k when they couldn't drive the price that high by buying every single bitcoin sold at auction and spreading it across multiple exchanges.

This is completely untrue. Sensitive information is stored on a special part of the users device and is decrypted with touchID. It is much more secure than a traditional credit card because at no point during a transaction is the card information exposed to anyone, and if someone takes your wallet they don't have access to it. Security wise it is analogous to bitcoin, aside from the bank still having access.

Correct, but that isn't how apple's system is going to work to my knowledge. Essentially all your passwords are in you encrypted keychain on your phone, and your fingerprint decrypts them. In addition, fingerprint data isn't stored in anything resembling a fingerprint, it is a bunch of information outputted by the touchid thing so one can't pretend to be you because they have a digital copy of your fingerprint from elsewhere.

Nothing, just like nothing is stopping them now. Except for the fact that nobody would hop on a stupid fork. If people like a change, the network will adopt it. If they don't, it won't. If you honestly believe that bitcoin can't tolerate a change in leadership, then why are you investing in it?

They aren't an advertising company and seemingly have little interest in collecting user data. Google on the other hand is an advertising company and the vast majority of their revenue comes from ad targeting. They also use end to end encryption in iMessage so that a hypothetical government agency with access to apple servers can't read user messages. Microsoft has repeatedly created backdoors for such agencies. Apple doesn't necessarily do this out of a sense of morality, but their business model is inherently more consumer friendly than that of their competition, excluding maybe amazon.

The issue is that in cases where a currency is failing it is due to hyperinflation, which generally means the government is having to print money at an unsustainable rate to cover its costs. I don't think they would get behind a currency where they no longer have the ability to do that when they are still failing to balance their budget without fucking over their currency. However, if the government somehow managed to recover, BitCoin would probably be a viable alternative to creating a new currency because the old one was so destroyed like argentina did.
You are definitely right on the consumer side of those situations, although they could still put their wealth into a foreign currency like USD to protect it from their governments.

I think the issue is that regardless of the measures they put in place, they can't stop people from turning BTC into USD or EUR without massively devaluing it, which at this point isn't feasible. Laws only go as far as the government is able to enforce them.

It would be pretty trivial to do. Sell all your bitcoins, hit most exchanges in the morning (except your local one in bulgaria) when the banks open, buy at the low point, and sell when it recovers later in the day. Repeat as long as you can afford the botnet, and then wait as the bitcoin you bought at $30 returns to its proper valuation.

Apple definitely does shift technological paradigms. There were GUI computers before the macintosh and mp3 players before the iPod and touch cap phones before the iPhone and tablets before the iPad.

@_date: 2013-05-04 08:07:10


This is irrelevant. Back when gold was widely used as a currency, do you believe that the average person mined theirs? A pool of a thousand people with X combined hashrate is functionally identical to a corporation of 10 people with the same hashrate. And if that corporation or pool was to be wiped off the face of the earth one day, almost nothing would happen to the network. That is the benefit of decentralization, and I don't think past the point of obscurity the goal was ever for every single person to be printing their own currency.

Fluctuation is the result of a couple factors that will disappear  as bitcoin grows. The market cap low, and very little wealth can influence the price a lot. In the future there will be more bitcoin on the market and it will be worth more, and no single player will be able to manipulate the market as much as they are able to now. And there aren't very many exchanges, and they are all really weak. Knocking out one causes chain panic selling on all of them. Again, this won't be an issue when there are more exchanges, and they are more resilient to DDOS and micro trading.
Your post makes perfect sense and these are completely legitimate concerns to have, and they are certainly affecting the functionality of bitcoin right now. I just don't think they will affect it in the future as its potential is realized.

Say you are sitting behind a wall, and the enemy is sitting behind another wall. They won't leave the wall because they think you will shoot them. You can get up, walk over and pop them in the head before on their client you have ever left cover. Sure, they could do the same to you, but doing that with almost any other player, you would be killed.
Also, let's say the other person is strafing back and fourth behind their cover. The game client uses extrapolation and interpolation to make enemy movements appear smooth, when in reality they are basically just a bunch of position and velocity updates. So say he is walking towards the edge of the cover, and then stops. Your client knows that he is walking towards the edge of the cover, but it doesn't know what he will do next (in reality, he stops before he leaves the cover) but in order to make the movement smooth even with low frequency updates, your client assumes he will keep moving until it gets the information that he stopped. For a split second, he will have walked out of cover despite never doing that on his client, getting him killed.
In your other comment, you are making the mistake of using games where hits are registered serverside as an example.

There isn't one. It is functionally identical to using a debit card. Debit cards are widely used and accepted, so they are used for small purchases.

You are talking out of your ass. In any game where hits are registered clientside, you have a huge advantage with high latency and low bandwidth.

They will be safe there, (the people running blockchain.info couldn't access your coins if they wanted to, and if they get hacked the hackers wouldn't be able to take the coins). The only way the coins could conceivably be lost is if they voluntarily shut down, and they would likely warn you about that and give you time to move to another wallet.
That said, diversifying to other wallets (offline and online) once you get a significant amount is never a bad idea.

Why? Walk up to vending machine, pick drink, it displays a QR code, you scan it, and the coke comes out.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:17:51
So then what is a libertarian in europe?
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:46:51
Which they can only try to implement. If something would produce truly catastrophic results for bitcoin, it won't be adopted by miners.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:14:59
Price doesn't matter. Anyone selling has no guarantee of ever getting their money.
@_date: 2013-11-08 09:02:34
Yeah but they can't actually do that. They can tax capital gains because you are going to go through an exchange that they regulate, they can tax your income in BTC through your employer, they can't however take any bitcoin holdings because they don't have the private key or any way to find the person who does.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:47:57

Which is why bottle caps are the real solution

Many people had no idea what they were doing and bought really high. I imagine it is pretty difficult for them to calm down right now.
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:15:12
People are free to open banking services in bitcoin for people who aren't competent enough to manage their own finances.
@_date: 2013-04-21 21:00:24
They aren't desperately trying to hold on.
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:03:48
Dude, we just hit 130. Your prediction might be true when you wake up tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:18:23
Why are you being downvoted for this?
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:24:00
That is so stupid. I can't wait until we are actually in charge of our money.
@_date: 2013-02-25 07:29:35

Who would willingly put paypal in charge of "dispute resolution"?
@_date: 2013-05-03 04:43:43
I can't imagine IBM saying "Oh hey, we are about to make one of the most significant steps in the history of computing and possibly human technology just so we can break bitcoin, something we have absolutely no reason to care about" to investors.
@_date: 2013-08-07 23:53:42
That is extremely bad considering the value of your unit drops exponentially as time goes on.
@_date: 2013-09-12 06:55:59
It is really hilarious how quickly that sort of attitude did a total 180 in between the fanbases.
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:32:25
That would require a ridiculous amount of the federal budget. 
@_date: 2013-06-30 09:34:46
Then we can hope that these get into enough hands that the market doesn't become super centralized for a while.
@_date: 2013-07-16 14:58:31


Believe me, that was my first guess as well. But I have tried pretty much everything. Hopefully they will be able to fix it.
And my first attempts were in the US. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:00:21
We promote the merchants because we want more ways to spend BTC, and more merchants will use it when they see the publicity bump others got.

Step 1: Sign up for an account at blockchain.info
Step 2: Go to bitinstant and fill out the form with the bitcoin address that blockchain.info gives you on the "account" page.
Step 3: Deposit money and wait 15 minutes

Hold on to it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:09:41
The tulip bubble popped because people realized how worthless they were. The exact opposite will happen here. When the bubble reaches its peak, bitcoin will be a widely used currency and there will cease to be a bubble.
@_date: 2013-03-07 13:57:39
I am not him, but there is a difference between scamming people and trading currency. He is absolutely right that the people who sold did so on poor information, expecting the bubble to pop when it wasn't going to. They made a mistake, and nobody is responsible for that but them.
@_date: 2013-04-02 23:17:06
The difference is that bitcoin can and will change to compete and survive.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:00:40
@_date: 2013-04-01 22:09:26
I can't imagine anyone betting against that.
@_date: 2013-04-02 23:13:23
For anyone who doesn't know, the idea is to force larger retailers to accept bitcoin by undercutting them.
@_date: 2013-06-21 08:26:45
Which would you recommend? Are there security concerns with any of them?
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:10:11
Nobody is going to invest in something tied to facebook's survival.
@_date: 2013-03-06 08:51:49
There is literally nothing wrong with this logic.
@_date: 2013-05-18 19:45:19
To be fair that is generally what happens when a programmer tries to make anything visual.
@_date: 2013-03-31 05:46:16
Even more important is that the attention started dropping just over $50
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:26:59
Ask them which stocks aren't imaginary.
@_date: 2013-08-23 03:00:00
I can't really blame them. Someone will lose their money and they will blame apple and then they have a huge PR mess on their hands.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:33:03
I only bought in at $90, so I am going to wait at least a little bit longer. Probably $200.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:14:29
Wow, didn't realize lite coin was moving so much. Might start mining that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:18:14
He should be getting paid regardless.
@_date: 2013-02-25 07:23:44
Could you explain why calling it something else could change it's legality?
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:17:31
Also, it encourages saving instead of debt.
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:12:00
I don't know anything about your situation apart from this potential investment.
@_date: 2013-04-07 07:36:36
Can it not stay cool without the fan?
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:51:31
If they wanted to kill bitcoin they needed to have done it a long time ago. Too many people mining now.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:22:28
Why would they do that? The currency would be ridiculously valued before they managed to sell of a fraction of their holdings.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:51:37
gaben is the founder and CEO
@_date: 2013-03-06 07:30:06
It wouldn't really be an efficient method of conversion if they lose half their money. I think a 1:1 ratio would be more effective.
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:08:36
It needs to be larger in order for it to stabilize. And that means costing more.
**CHOO CHOO ALL ABOARD THE BUBBLE TRAIN!!!**
@_date: 2013-03-10 08:27:32
Oh, I see. It doesn't really matter given that namecoin can be mined without any extra computational resources, so I wouldn't see it as a competitor.
@_date: 2013-04-21 21:44:58
I tried to switch off of Gox, and then the exchange I switched to got shut down. As much as I (and presumably the rest of their users) want to stop using it, they are the most stable exchange right now. They need a real competitor.
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:18:55
It is just a dropbox plugin that syncs the actual wallet.dat file into a folder in your dropbox.

I don't see what your point is. People that are able to intelligently invest will have to do less work in the real world. And there isn't really much wrong with that.
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:06:13
You can also go through bitinstant if you are willing to run to cvs or walmart.
@_date: 2013-04-18 08:45:13
Hopefully when I wake up everything will be working again...
@_date: 2013-02-25 01:03:06
I guess their theory is that if they don't release a product like that, someone will, and difficulty will be driven up regardless.
@_date: 2013-03-28 07:29:31
How did you buy them? I have been trying to find a way since $40 and everything is either broken or involves a bunch of third parties.
@_date: 2013-03-09 07:05:16
Wow, I almost bought through them. Really glad I read this. What service would you recommend?
@_date: 2013-05-18 19:50:28
I think it is much more likely that Shinichi just worked with a programer friend.

They will basically give you two of them, or one with two boards inside.
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:15:03
I really don't see any other way.
@_date: 2013-03-22 18:29:21

Thank you so much!
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:03:12
If I understand it correctly (and it's likely that I don't), doesn't proof of stake mean that people with more holdings in the currency are paid more?
@_date: 2013-04-27 20:09:19
Just like we can divide gold and silver into little tiny flakes, it is irrelevant. The point he is trying to make is that there is no set supply limit for a metal. Eventually we will be efficiently mining asteroids and our supply will be functionally unlimited with many metals.
@_date: 2013-09-12 03:17:06
Its really funny because every time there is a new humble bundle he posts the exact same numbers which don't match up with any of the amounts on the website.
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:29:11
1) I have my wallet files from their website in dropbox, but how do I use them?
2) The website is only down temporarily. We would likely see a drop if they got hacked, but given how they store coins I don't think that is likely.
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:17:54
Dude, that was like two years ago. Everyone here is old enough to have been in bitcoin when that happened.
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:46:38
How dangerous is keeping the majority of it in blockchain.info wallets? I want to move it to local storage soon but the qt client doesn't work on my computer for some reason.
@_date: 2013-05-11 21:34:54
But that isn't really relevant to anything. The strength of something isn't measured in the culmination of everything it has done. It's like measuring the horsepower of a car in how many miles it has driven.
@_date: 2013-05-29 23:14:54
On another note, is she good at trading them?
@_date: 2013-04-07 07:47:40
Yeah, but there really hasn't been much going on.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:15:49
How are those words tasting right now?
@_date: 2013-07-06 01:34:00
At which point it actually will be more cost effective to do it with bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:58:38
I did exactly that. I feel like I bought high enough that I am not very secure when the bubble pops.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:18:05
Why the fuck are people still using this shit? It has almost singlehandedly destroyed the value of bitcoin TWICE, and it doesn't even work when anything significant is happening in the market.
@_date: 2013-09-12 03:11:08
I don't want to start an argument, but aside from not knowing what you mean by encryption being built in the answer is yes.
@_date: 2013-06-21 19:49:10
Yeah, I agree. It is the most widely known symbol though.
@_date: 2013-03-06 09:06:54
We should totally have NFC plastic bitcoins...
@_date: 2013-03-06 08:57:22
If BTC becomes relevant, dollars will be worth less. In 5 years we aren't comparing BTC to its USD value then, we are comparing it relative to USD now. Otherwise, predictions like these would be totally unsafe to make.
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:20:50
well that is the greatest thing I have seen all week
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:42:14
They were actually filming themselves moving empty boxes around
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:18:54
What are you looking at? Bitfloor spiked up from people trying to get out of their bank account and everything else seems unchanged.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:41:41
And it wouldn't take much money to drive the price up to a point where the government can't afford to contine.

Bought over 9 from them two days ago. Worked perfectly, had the coins in a couple minutes.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:16:58
And they deserve to be, if bitcoin lives up to its potential. Being first to the scene with something like this is very important.
@_date: 2013-03-04 19:45:37
There is no way they could influence btc enough for that to be profitable

There are other payment apps available (paypal, etc), but apple typically gets blamed whenever the user is incompetent (remember all the news articles about kids buying shit on their parent's accounts?) so it makes sense from a PR standpoint to disallow a payment app that isn't managed by a third party.
@_date: 2013-08-23 06:31:20
dwolla dwolla bill yall
@_date: 2013-07-03 21:15:24
I would recommend you go to for this sort of thing as people here tend to have no idea what they are talking about. People have been buying BTC on MtGox to take it out of the exchange, which artificially raises the price. Expect to see it drop to where it is at other exchanges if withdrawals come back.
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:12:33
That really sucks. Maybe put some money on a balloon and send it in our direction?

I think the skill ceiling in FTL is ridiculously low, and way too much of the game is about chance.

No, the court can order you to turn over the passwords. It has happened a couple times although I think at some point that was ruled unconstitutional, but that wouldn't really apply to bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-06 08:10:38
Probably not very, the bulk of the load would come from verification.

Not him, but he hasn't responded:
Under current conditions it is being used like a stock
No idea about bond
It can be used to buy and sell goods like currencies can
You could say that it is like a commodity because its value is determined by supply and demand, but the same could be said about everything else on the list
It is deflationary like a precious metal

"Why do I need X" is a universal complaint about new technologies. You don't need it. You didn't need the internet, or a smart phone. Only after those reached mainstream adoption because of their merits were they necessary to be productive.

Could you explain why this needs its own currency though? Why cant the alternative domains be registered with bitcoin or litecoin?

The point of having a 64 bit processor is to handle larger instructions and eventually address more than 4gb of ram. The point of having a fingerprint scanner is to make phone security less intrusive and more secure than it is now.

I think the idea is that banks are taking action with regards to bitcoin, which adds to their legitimacy either way.
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:52:08
This line of thinking is flawed. Either cryptos will work now or they won't work at all. Botnets aren't going to get weaker relative to the average user's bandwidth, and banks are always going to fight it with their last breath, and people are always going to want to daytrade it, often with bots. Nothing is going to get better, and none of these problems are inherent in bitcoin. They have all been solved in every other aspect of the internet, and they will be solved here.
What "Shortfalls of bitcoin"? None of the current problems are issues with bitcoin. It will be the amateurish exchanges and wallet services that get replaced, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-07 07:22:04


I might be wrong, but this is completely redundant. It's like saying "hyperdeflation is actually causing hyperdeflation".

Which is going to go great until they are in another country and you are facing the exact same currency exchange fees you are with bitcoin, in addition to the transaction fee, which in total could be well over the cost of converting to bitcoin and then converting it back again.

And increasing the value will decrease the price fluctuations that make it difficult for businesses to adopt, increasing spending.
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:59:12
It is possible that they were in control, but unlikely. I don't see why else they would be doing it other than to buy in. They know nothing concrete is holding the value back.

Yeah, but that would happen after the closed release of the technology. Once we know quantum computing is possible, our encryption and mining would be upgraded pretty quickly, most likely before whoever is developing the computer even has it working.

It is already easy to convert and use bitcoin, it is just hard to get the money to the exchanges.

I feel like most of the stuff on that website would work pretty well for home defense actually...

my 8350 at 4.8GHz only gets like .3.. I think something may be wrong.

Getting informed I encourage, what I don't like is trying to inform other people when you don't understand it yourself. That is purely detrimental to bitcoin.

Thanks for the help! My miner seems to handle multiple devices well, but I will remember that if there are any problems.
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:39:38
There is probably a massive buy wall there
@_date: 2013-02-25 03:09:24
But does the currency exist for the domain registration?

It doesn't matter if it is destroyed, the manufacturer/coder will have had access to your wallet since before you did.

You can look up the under load power consumption on your GPU for free...

Bitinstant already exists.
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:34:08
You can deposit cash at CVS as well.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:39:49
You know nothing about apple.
@_date: 2013-05-26 21:41:30
Woah, why was that downvoted so hard?
@_date: 2013-04-14 09:08:27
Yeah, but it seems like that would favor centralization far more than a fair-mining based economy, which sort of defeats the point in my eyes.
@_date: 2013-02-25 00:39:27
How are you getting that?
@_date: 2013-02-24 19:41:24
But doesn't it cost you more to power it than it's earning?
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:09:42
I don't get the current obsession with spending. The economy needs to stabilize in order for that to happen, so the price needs to rise a lot, so people need to hoard it, at least for now.

And bitcoin needs to be judged to the same standards as its competitors if it hopes to replace them.
