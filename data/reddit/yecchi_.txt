Capitalism naturally creates unequal relationships that lead to hierarchies. Ancaps' issue with public tyranny is that its not private tyranny.

All the more reason it should be distributed in a way other than purchasing power and farmed in a sustainable fashion.
Once the corpses start piling up in the streets, at some point, it must be conceded that capitalism simply isn't a logically tenable form of organization.

How would it be? You can elect to not be bound by the decision if you feel strongly enough about it. The strength of an anarchist society is that your livelihood doesn't depend on going along with a decision. That's not possible under any kind of capitalism.


By organizing in an anarchist manner where all the people involved in the activity get a say in an open forum and everyone gets one vote. Direct democracy works because its an organization of real people at the local level, not unaccountable representatives.
Anarchist society is built like an onion with layers upon layers of these kinds of associations.

The same applies if you're threatened with starvation if you don't submit yourself to a boss, or ostracization if you don't fall in line with everyone else.

Direct democracy based on free association is the most empowering form of self-governance. It's concepts like private property and capitalism that set people at each other's throats, force them to fight like stray dogs over scraps of food, and create incentives to screw each other over.

That's definitely not true in bitcoin. There's a set amount of wealth that can exist and the majority of it is already concentrated in the hands of a few. If adoption increases, the problem only gets worse.
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:51:11
That's precisely why you remove competition and replace it with cooperation. Change the incentives so its in everyone's interest to help each to help themselves instead of fuck everyone else over. That means replacing corporations with cooperatives, and representative democracy with direct democracy.
This is in contrast to the ancap vision of everyone being feudal lords of a few acres in some Max Mad hellscape.
