Gold is valuable as a physical metal. 
So that would make it 100 percentage points more valuable than cryptos

Very bad for those who had hoped to become rich without working (100% of buyers).
@_date: 2018-11-10 10:11:52
It sounds like you suffer from FONSIR (fear of not striking it rich)
@_date: 2018-11-12 18:51:34
It protects people from having cash. It's like a condom against being rich
@_date: 2018-11-08 11:03:26
It will drop below 2500 pretty quickly

Bitcoin Noncash is even worse than Bitcoin Cash
The latter is at least cash

You will admit that Melting The Polar Caps in order to produce Nothing (bitcoin) is a foolish idea.
@_date: 2018-11-06 06:37:01
Not through fees, but losing fiat through BTC depreciation.

It will be in the Screaming Wojak cycle for the next infinity years

Try doing something useful
@_date: 2018-11-11 10:19:35
Exactly, but some assets have a floor.
For example if my Amazon stock pays me $1 a day in dividend, why should I sell it for $0.1? Even if the highest bid was $0.0 I would laugh that off because the dividend provides a floor.
However with other things, there is no floor. So bitcoin will go straight to zero cents

Get burnt buying bitcoin at 19 thousand dollar
@_date: 2018-11-09 03:32:29
Yeah but I would have to bid $6399 for one, and honestly even if it was asking $00.01 I would be concerned about purchasing it.
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:56:39
My theory is that people enjoy paying as little as possible.
For example if I offered you a bitcoin at $100 million, you would probably say: "I would like to pay less."
So that is how I feel about $6000. Namely I would like to pay $0
@_date: 2018-11-09 02:50:59
Imagine some Nigerian prince asked for $6400 and promised you $1,000,000 in an email.
One of your friends bites the scam and you tell him: "You fool! You've been scammed!"
And he says: "The market has spoken. The fact I felt comfortable coughing up $6400 proves its value."
That is the same reason why Bitcoin is now trading at $6400 but in truth it's worthless and going to zero cents.
@_date: 2018-11-10 05:34:07
Consider the scenario in your mind that you buy at 6550 and later it goes to 1700
That could affect the attractiveness of the purchase
@_date: 2018-11-12 12:26:34
It seems that an incredibly enormous fall is in the cards.
You will be lucky to sell for 1 thousand

While you were banning them, you lost another 30 grand on bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-12 19:05:50
Yeah Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and as such is headed to $0
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:31:54
I will explain what intrinsic value means.
Imagine you have 2 items on the desk: one is a bottle of Coke, and the other is a paper certificate that says "1 bottle of Coke."
The first item has intrisic value, and the other one doesn't, even if the promise to redeem the item is highly credible.
@_date: 2018-11-11 11:02:00
But Bitcoin Cash is also limited to 21 million
@_date: 2018-11-09 01:31:50
Bitcoin is worth $00.00
How can it store wealth?
If you have a stock, at least it entitles you to periodic dividend payouts.
The real question is what are you going to do when you realize you Blew a year+ of your life on this failed project.
Worse, you will then have to devise a brand new get rich scheme.
Remember: Nothing x scarcity = Nothing
