The huge cross is the thing that tipped me off.
I showed my mother and she told me that if it was real there is no way in hell the "Teacher" would have got qualified if they did something like that.

That is awesome. Not only will it allow people in countries that are restricting access to bitcoin it also allows much more privacy on blockchain.info.
Nice work guys!

Yknow what, I only have a GPU but for tomorrow, I'm gonna mine on slush.
It will bring back fond memories, I might even use GUIMiner for it, and also, it will help change bitcoin. That's nice. It makes me happy.

Thanks for reaching out. what i really want too say is that, I am a programmer and white-hat network security tester, i get payed for most of my jobs online in bitcoin. it is the best way i could think of to get money in a secure way with some form of anonymity. i don't have to give the person i am working with anything except a public key and they can pay me with next too no fees. bitcoin is amazing, try to protect it and keep it the way satoshi would.
