I'm just saying the people that would be lauded as being "smart"
Obviously a ton of this stuff is guesswork and luck, but if someone did the 1k-20k thing people would be like "omg so smart" when they obviously lucked out

You've got plenty of time to really test out the $1M or $0 idea
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:06:05
I hope you're right but my feeling is if we stay over 10K it'll be in the 11-13 range, but we could dump again down to 8k
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:33:27
If BTC goes to 30K then the "smart" people bought in at 1k, sold at 20k, doubled up under 10k, and then rode to 30k.  It's impossible to really be truly "smart" since you'd need to catch every big break, which isn't happening no matter how good your TA/gut are.

Obviously yeah, just saying that of course everyone gets called stupid because nobody actually followed the "ideal" path
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:37:05
Yeah I don't get people who said it wasn't a bubble and were calling people buying it to speculate "mass adoption"...
I mean it's obviously a bubble, the question was more of what stage we were in.  There's money to be made in a bubble.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:04:29
Let's be real, the ideal "smart person" bought under 1k, sold at 20k and isn't hanging out on reddit haha
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:07:25
Gotta love that a moon shot relative to that is only 12-13k :(

Because it makes purchasing BTC a lot less intimidating and more accessible for the average person looking at it as an investment
I mean, if there was a hot new company you wanted to buy stock in, but first you needed to buy a physical device and get all sorts of weird passwords to store your stock, it could be overwhelming, right?  But if you knew you could go to a reputable website, put in your money, and click "buy", it would be so much easier.  That's the value of Coinbase.

Yep, any profits are taxable income.  Rate of tax depends on if you held for more than a year or not (long-term capital gains taxed around 15% vs short term taxed as income).
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:11:31
Yeah if you're just holding and don't sell you don't pay taxes.  Once you sell or convert to another crypto on gdax you'll have to pay taxes (even if the money is still in your account on gdax).

Most of those people are either:
1. Not posting because they already cashed out and have no reason to hang out on bitcoin subreddit
2. Not posting because it would make them a target if they're still hodling

If you poke around on you should be able to find arguments against bitcoin as an investment in plenty of comment sections (bubble, etc).
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:32:10
Yes, just be careful.  While the volatility of bitcoin makes it pretty likely that these types of orders would fill, keep in mind that there's always the possibility that you sell at 8200 and the price doesn't come down for your limit buy, so you miss out on potential gains.
But yeah, in theory that should work, no fees if you're a market maker (buying below current market, selling above current market).

200BTC wall on either side haha
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:44:12
Sure, if you have a few bucks here and there it's fine to do that.  On Coinbase the fees are quite high, though, so I would recommend buying on GDAX instead (you automatically have a GDAX account if you sign up for Coinbase and can move your funds from Coinbase to GDAX for free).
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:12:10
That's more what I'm looking for, and the fees are lower right? How can I transfer my BTC between coinbase and gdax? I hate waking up and seeing big action overnight on coinbase when I would have wanted to buy/sell at certain prices

Might want to turn this into 10K-11K combo thread since it's gonna hit both today
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:37:37
8.3 seems to be support... for now
It'll be interesting to see if it can handle another assault or not.  If it breaks, I wager we'll see low 7s by tomorrow.
