u swapped BCH onchain to LN Offchain... So where'd the BCH onchain go? Did submarine keep it and gave u an offchain coin? 
Why not swap it for onchain BTC? Did u have to run full node? Open channel? I dont get it, what am I missing here?

Cant we open a channel without a node?

How does LN wallet work? Must it be online 24/7 too? 
You send BTC from trezor to a LN wallet? Then send back BTC to trezor after the receiving payments? 
Do u still need to pay for opening/closing channel if you have a LN wallet?
Sorry, newbie tryng to understand :(
