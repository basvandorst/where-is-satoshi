While I don't think .00005 is the perfect solution to this problem, I'm up-voting to get this thread visibility so it can be discussed more thoroughly.

I mined 6.5 on a gaming laptop a couple years ago. They were worth about 8 bucks a piece, so I just gambled them away. Oops.

Interesting. My Visa debit card worked when I threw it in there today.

I can't really weigh in on the security aspect of things. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable than I will swing by and give their two bitcents. Personally, I'm looking into offline wallet(s) on USB drives, but I havent implemented it yet (and I'm not sure if that's the best choice).

Value of the Bitcoin compared to what? The goal of Bitcoin is to try and decrease our reliance on fiat currencies.
How about just make it a fraction of a percentage of the money transferred? That will scale better as fiat currency further inflates.

I actually have an account with them for when I decide to sell. I didnt realize there was a different fee for depositing vs withdrawing.
For buying in, I used coinbase, which charged me 1%. Unfortunately, last I checked they are only supporting market orders with a multiple day lag (I cant check from work through). I'd also guess that $10K is too much volume for them since it took over a week to crank my more modest investment through their system.

Bitfloor is probably your best bet. Super low commission. Super fast account verification. You might have to spread your orders out a bit depending on what the order book looks like, though.

One satoshi is the lowest possible starting point for Bitcoin gambling.
He also said "same 3x bet," which I extrapolated to mean "Same 3x payout / same bet / same betting strategy." That lead me to believe he was doubling with every iteration. Additionally, typical users of Martingale double with every iteration.
That being said, his post was a little ambiguous, so maybe he did mean same payout instead of same bet and payout.
I still don't believe him, though. According to a calculator I used if he played the 3x payout 1000 times, a 39 loss streak would only have a 0.003% chance of occurring.

I subscribed way back when it was 50 subscribers, but lost the key to the account. Does anyone know how I can recover it?

No you didn't.
Starting with one satoshi, that comes out to 4000 BTC after 39 bets using the martingale strategy.

This should be an easy one for ya:
Let's say I buy 50 BTC at $5 and 50 BTC at $10 a week later.
I have 100 BTC total, right?
If I sell 5 BTC, 5 weeks afterward, when price rises to $11/BTC, do I use the coins bought at $10 or $5 to calculate capitol gains tax?
