Yes. Although I haven't had to use it yet. And I'm doing my best to not have to.

Stick to it. Set a target date for when you'd like to hit 1BTC and work your way backwards in smaller increments. You'll have to factor in growth. I just wanted to show people what it took to get there when you aren't buying 1 at once. Good luck!

21 Million Bitcoin will ever be released. Buying 1 whole puts you in the 21 Million club. Only 21 million people can ever own a whole bitcoin. Same for the 1 million club but you'd have to own 21 bitcoin.

At a basic level, if demand stays exactly the same and less bitcoin is issued per block, value goes up. I'd safely bet it will increase the value. But I guess we all are betting that.

Pretty much. I was also able time time a dip or two.  I set up a monthly budget and used the rest on bitcoin. I also ordered a bitcoin debit card in case I needed access to emergency funds.

Continue buying. You might wait for a dip that might never come. If it dips, buy extra!

I'm on an entirely different IP I've never used to log into reddit before on. I think I'll be ok.

Yeah man. Have you seen the markup on printer ink?

HODL until 2024. I'm going to accumulate as much btc as possible before the next halvening in 2020. I'll also start branching out into some altcoins to play with.

I was generating a wallet recently and I suddenly got paranoid that I had it up on my screen and the blinds were open. I was thinking someone could take a pic of my QR code and steal my coins. I forgot that the wallet was BIP38 password encrypted and I was just being paranoid. This is one of those games where a little paranoia can be healthy.
