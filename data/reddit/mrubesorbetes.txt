I wonder what all those people who ridiculed are thinking now.
EDIT: Just read through the whole thing. Someone called BTC "autism kroners." Hahaha. Maybe we should adopt that name then?

Yes, but as stated in my post, that just adds a layer of complexity, and still poses the same problem: my BTC purchase now might mean that I bought something at five times the price a few weeks later. E.g., if I bought that $20/year hosting at sgc-hosting and BTC doubles in price a week after, then that means I bought hosting at $40/year and lost a potential $20 in the process.

You make a good point. It's just that I don't feel regret if I use USD, but I will if I use BTC. A psychological thing? But thanks for explaining it so well.

And your point is? From what I understand, most of those transactions are from buying USD, not from buying other products.

seems to be defending bitcoinguy though. The others are just downright dismissive.

So right now, the incentive for using BTC is for merely supporting the system? I'd really like to get to a point where everything is stable, where I won't worry about regretting any purchase I made using BTC.
And this part is only true theoretically:


Yes, but dollar values do not fluctuate as wildly as BTC. I bought my domain names at NameCheap at around $10 a piece last week, and right now they're still at $10 a piece. If I pushed through with using BTC, their dollar value right now would be at $16.
