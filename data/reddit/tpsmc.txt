It's a trap! This girl once told me that that something like 50% of women are battered and every fucking one I have ever eaten has been plain.

That's a pretty good read. I hope you dont have a fire but even in your blog post you point out that stacking of servers lead to the cause of the fire, Your shelves look like they are about 15/20u each, most miners will take around what... 6u, maybe 8u, are you just going to leave all that open space between shelves? Invest in racks, if you can't afford racks you can buy some angle iron posts and drill and tap holes.

Yeah, it sucks to lose, but it is petty cash compared to some people losses. I count myself lucky I can afford to lose it.

I will gladly accept your bitcoin today for 85% of the value tomorrow.

If you crunch the numbers I think there is a much larger potential ROI if you took out a loan and purchased Doge. Right now its around .29 USD for 1000 Doge; if Doge were to see a bubble like bitcoin you could be a gazillionaire.

Thank you, this paywall shit is BS and the people linking it and up voting should be flogged.

Seems to me putting one of these in a strip club would be a lot more profitable.
