Fed is rising interest rates on purpose to extort Trump. Will make the interest payment on the \~$30 trillion we owe the Fed higher, meaning more of the budget will go towards paying it (budget cuts elsewhere) and having to take out even more loans from the Fed to pay the interest. All the negatives that occur due to the rising of the interest rates will be attributed to the Trump presidency. This is just in time for midterms.
This is how the Federal Reserve extorts candidates they don't like and this is the whole point to the criminal Federal Reserve racket... political power out of the hands of the people and into the hands of the Banks.
Don't forget, the Federal Reserve is owned by the big banks. It is not a part of the federal government, and it operates independently, yet its policies and action have very dire and important effects on the country.

@_date: 2018-09-22 15:46:29
Couldn't be farther from the truth. This is about cutting someone off economically. Cutting off their livelihood. Trying to make it impossible to function and provide a living for themselves. This is where its going. Finance in the US is completely privately controlled. Immense amount of power. This industry is highly regulated. Not free market at all. And this will set a precedent for them to destroy financially whoever they want if they disagree with their politics.
To sum up, banks and financial institutions, all work together as a cartel, targeting those they disagree with to destroy their livelihood. Ultimately goal is to have total control of financial system (which they already do have via the Fed) and cut off anyone who disagrees. Thereby destroying their livelihood and making it impossible for them to survive financially within society. This is a travesty. And it is not a quality of a free society. This is why Bitcoin and decentralized currencies are so important.

You're wrong about the debt really. As long as US stays on top as the dominant military power, and can continue to create a monopoly on the world's oil supply and therefore enforce the dollar (ie "petrodollar") as the world reserve currency, then the debt will theoretically be able to grow into perpetuity as long as demand for the dollar continues to grow and expand (along with demand for oil). 
My belief however, is that you are right. The US is being set up for a shift of power elsewhere. Possibly the EU in 10-15 years by the globalist pigs at the UN/WorldBank/IMF. If that shift goes to China or Russia, it wasn't planned since those nations aren't controlled to the same extent as the US or EU.

This argument against Bitcoin is being manufactured by the Socialist Banking Scum that run this planet in hopes of inspiring legislation that will lead to its banning. Resist these totalitarians at all costs. Everything you read is skewed for their benefit. They control it all, and having control on the money supply gives them that control. Bitcoin is the largest threat they have ever come across, and will render central banks obsolete if it ever becomes mainstream.

The plan for us all. Step out of line, and be cut of financially, from participating in the system, from being able to live and provide for yourself.
The cartel that runs this world, that owns the central banking system and has its claws in virtually every government and business in the world (western world especially) needs to seriously get fucked. Bringing about some totalitarian world order through gradual policy change and relinquishing of personal freedom and liberty. Treasonous marxist Fabian Society cunts. Fuck the UN, WorldBank, and IMF.

I’ve been in BTC for a year. Dollar cost averaging. I researched the tech before investing. Realized the risks. Believe in BTC in theory. I know the BTC blockchain has been had its obstacles (crashes, hacks, attacks, DDOS,etc). I am not a computer science major however. I hope the code holds up and the network maintains its integrity. Every downturn is a test for the network. And every downturn it survives increases its value.

If only you knew the truth.
@_date: 2018-11-01 22:17:14
Every time you take out a loan from the Bank, it's creating money, since it doesn't write off the cash from the other accounts. This is why your Savings Account always displays the amount you put into it, instead of the real amount (the reserve ratio) which is usually about 10% of your deposit (but could be less, even 0%).
So, let's say you deposit $20,000 into a savings account with a bank. The Bank can then take 90% of that and loan it out. Your account though will still say $20,000, and they take $18,000 (by creating it out of thin air via bookkeeping trickery) and give it to the person wanting the loan. That person, then deposits that $18,000 into their bank account. The bank can then loan $16,200 (90%) from this new deposit to someone who wants a loan. However, the person's account with the new deposit will still say $18,000.
Thus, at the moment, on top of the original deposit of $20,000, the Bank has effectively created $34,200 of new money. This process continues until the amount of cash is approximately 10X the original ($200,000; this is based on a 10% reserve ratio).

Sounds like something a banker would say after he just committed a massive sell-off to destabilize a currency that was threatening his power and livelihood.

BTC is designed to be held by the individual, not a central exchange. Anyone of any intelligence will hold their own keys.
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:37:01
Yes. They do. They loans money that doesn’t exist. Actually creating money in the process. When a bank writes you a loan, they just took that money from thin air, and force you to pay it back with high interest. The money from the depositors account never is “taken away”. Still on the books. So more money is created in the process. This happens many times as money is deposited into the banks by the person taking out the loan. Creating sometimes up to 10x the amount of cash originally deposited.

Hmmm you obviously know nothing about banking. There’s no way you’d be able to immediately transfer out $600 million from any bank. They would most likely not have that amount immediately on reserve to pay out for a single customer.

Following Waterloo, Rothschild sold all his English bonds. Fellow investors saw what he did, and they all folllowed suit, thinking he obviously heard word of English defeat. 
Once the price collapsed, Rothschild bought all the bonds back at a fraction of their price. The English obviously won. He now owned a large majority of all English bonds, that probably cemented his position within the banking system for generations to come if not til this day.

If the banks didn’t inflate currency through money printing you wouldn’t have to risk your savings in an investment account in order to keep pace with the inflation rate.
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:43:08
True. But the process of creating more dollars at interest, and paying off a mountain of debt impossible to pay off will go for perpetuity. This how the system was designed. The only problems occur when the dollar becomes less valuable, or stops growing in value. Money printing at that point, to pay off the debt, could then lead to hyperinflation. Again, this hasn't happened yet, due to the demand for "petro-dollars" and the dollars status as the world reserve.
