Completely agree.  This is the type of thinking that drew me to Bitcoin in the first place.  I think it's easy to get distracted with a lot of the politics and price watching, but if we can provide an alternative, stable economy outside of their fiat we'll on board huge numbers of people and this will be a massive win win. 
I've been in the process of developing a site/app for a bit specifically geared towards helping people with failing economies. I plan on releasing an alpha here in the next couple weeks. If you guys don't think it's totally useless, I will go ahead and start the non-profit process so we can:
1. Provide access to a working economy for the populations of failing nation states
1. On board them to Bitcoin, increasing demand and our long term value
1. Get those sweet tax breaks
Seems like an obviously good idea to me.  In the immediate short term I know [BitGive]( recently launched something to help track donations.  I don't know any of them and it sounds like their heart is in the right place even if their site looks a little ugly.
I think they are coming at it as more a traditional charity that happens to accept bitcoin (focusing on the transparency of the Blockchain) where as I am coming with the intention to ~~topple nation states through undermining their economic control~~ provide a working economy to populations in crisis.
