People do it all the time here, I've seen it with coffee shops and so on which start taking bitcoins as payment.

Coinbase and bitpay will convert it on the fly to dollars and deposit it in the reciever's bank account the next day, so all the risk would be with the payer.

As someone who recently gave a lot of money away, I think the net result of bitcoin becoming the norm will be everyone being more generous. I found it far easier to paste an address and number into coinbase then it is to fill out various details or boxes in paypal or a bank transfer. In general I've been giving to a lot more strangers and charities since using bitcoin.

I transferred on to coinbase from a cold storage system, using the online electrum to create a transaction, putting the transaction text file on a USB, signing it on the offline laptop then putting it back to the online PC to broadcast.
I certainly suggest treating coinbase and others as temporary hot wallets, not as your main bank account.

There has always been people with libertarian ideas who prefer a fixed deflationary currency, they existed long before bitcoin, the sort of people who were pushing for the gold standard. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:50:58
The market cap is something around 6 billion, but that takes the value of each bitcoin and multiplies it by the number of them in existence. Actually buying up all the bitcoins will take many times that, since the increased demand will cause the price to rise, especially if people worked out what Buffet was doing. Presumably it would cost a lot more than the 35 billion which Buffet has if he wanted to buy them all. Though I would guess the attempt would drive the price up into tens of thousands, rather than millions.

I remember quite a few Snowden articles about the NSA using their data to tip off the IRS - who would then lie about where it was sourced from. Is it possible that the IRS is changing in that direction, either already or within the next few years?

Whether or not they are, he can still use the word since if it describes a set of political ideas which are arguably close to what the founders believed in, even if the word wasn't around at the time.
Historically they would have been called liberals, but that word has a different definition these days. You could call them classical liberals. Classical liberalism is very close to what people mean today when they use the word libertarian.

I've ordered twice using a coinbase wallet, was instant.

Is there a way to convert it to an address without using my mobile phone?

Or alternatively, traded for weapons :)

Mahbod stepped down from the site after posting some "misogynist" annotations over Eliot Roger's manifesto. But that was much more "politically incorrect" than "rapey".

I was thinking of a clinic which just loads the game from your hard drive, maybe emulating a LAN

I figure that the feedback system will lead to getting people good at playing games, or maybe it depend on how much of a tip you offer

A good deal of that content was stuff that should be legally shared. Consider books. Copyright used to be about two decades, now through lots of lobbying it's be extended to about 80 years and will probably the climb higher. The result is that various groups who had no part of the creation process will sit on any copyrights they have, instead of releasing them for free (and often not even publishing it legally anymore), even though the author died decades ago. So acquiring the content requires library hunting, or paying lots of money for one of the last few copies, where really it should be on the internet as a PDF. Humanity ends up having a lot less knowledge available then should have. If you don't want people subverting copyright then you should not have let it become corrupted by rich lobbyists.

Isn't for latest flicks, since thousands of people will provide that for free. 
But there is a lot of obscure old stuff that cannot be found at the moment...

Thanks. I got a message from Firefox saying that it has prevented Flash from playing.

I'm obviously aware that that's an option.

It would be amazing at airports, It's horrible how they rip people off for converting currency.

Perhaps the devs are planning to onion it up eventually.

The admins are awful on reddit. There is no way to appeal or even find our what the shadowban is for.

I think this is more accurate then the comments talking about the nature of money. When I describe seasteading to people, it is likewise odd how many intelligent people are quick to describe insolvable engineering or political problems, without actually having made any effort to check if solutions exist already. 
I remember watching the news in the 90s, where a well-educated legal expert was asserting that email could never replace letters; and there is that example of skilled scientists asserting that heavier-than-air flight was impossible--a few years before the wright brothers. 
It seems to be a natural tendency of human nature rather than something specific to bitcoin.

I'd like a way to use it abroad without getting charged 5 bucks a purchase/withdrawal!

It is extremely rude considering many users write long comments for days before they notice.
@_date: 2013-08-24 11:48:02
You have a whole account dedicated to criticizing them, many posts being not much more than crude and offensive insults. It suggests an ulterior motive, which discourages people from having a careful discussion about the facts.

It's called [parallel construction]( the NSA spies without a warrant and then tips off the feds.

I highly suggest skipping the wait and just downloading Electrum. It seems mad to me that people think the ordinary client should be used.
@_date: 2013-06-22 21:37:32
Electrum is the obvious client to use to avoid this. I think it is a big mistake to not have it as the default one.

Something which concerns me is that I suspect that people capable of implementing strongly encrypted social media will have not much skill in marketing or design, and vice versa.

Would it be possible to attach a fraction of a cent in bitcoins to it, paying the miners to hash it for you?
@_date: 2013-10-17 23:08:31
An individual government official is able to buy bitcoins and then decide to influence policy in its favor, while the benefits of oppressing bitcoins would be shared between every other government.
@_date: 2013-03-15 08:53:17
Of course. The recipient has to claim them.

Not for me, I was falsely flagged as a "fraud" suspect, and it seems a lot of people had the same problem when I googled it.
