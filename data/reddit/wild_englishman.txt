I'm surprised they didn't refund the amount of bitcoins you originally sent to them. That would seem fair.  
  
If the value of bitcoin had soared in your currency in the meantime, you would be unhappy to have only received the original fiat value back.

If your adversary has knowledge of your stash, and is holding a gun to the head of someone you love, most people would sacrifice the stash for safety of themselves and loved ones.  
  
Doesn't matter if the stash is gold in a safe, currency under the mattress, bitcoin, or whatever rules/combination are applied to it.

People buy things they don't need, with money they don't have, to impress people they don't like.

Gambling is illegal in some places.  Regularly selling or selling at volume on localbitcoins may require a financial services license.

1) As far as I understand it, sellers on OB will sell through the same layout.  
  
2) Multi-sig, escrow and seller feedback profiles should minimise the risk of getting ripped off.  
  
3) Amazon's buying power is a significant advantage, but they often price *just* below other merchants, enough to get the sale.  
Even so, the absence of any meaningful fees on OB (sellers are charged circa 7% on Amazon or eBay), will hopefully pull down the price of goods enough to compete with Amazon.

There are a couple of issues that stop professional sports gamblers using or adopting "bitcoin bookmakers".  
  
The prices on offer at the bitcoin bookmakers are always a bit worse than the bookmakers in Asia, where the vast majority of sports betting turnover is made. This is almost certainly because the bitcoin bookmakers simply place your bet at one of the asian bookmakers after taking your bet, scraping a bit of the price for themselves, in addition to the commission they earn for generating the turnover.  
I have yet to see a bitcoin bookmaker who is making their own prices or managing their own book for sports betting.  
  
The obvious barrier for professional sports gamblers is simply the risk associated with holding trading capital in bitcoin. It's a risk that someone depending on their returns from gambling as their main income, just doesn't need.  
  
For recreational gamblers, who do not have or even want access to the asian bookmakers, and who will convert from fiat to bitcoin, make the bet, take the winnings out and convert back to fiat, there is certainly a value to the service of these bitcoin bookmakers, but I think odd prices and trading capital value risk will prohibit adoption by the majority of professional sports gamblers.

I think he meant that your bitcoin could vanish from an exchange, but bitcoin in general is not going away.

Mr. Lahey, I didn't understand a word you just said to me!

Apparently there will be small fees for verifying transactions after all coins are mined.

Rumour has it that paypal not only log the IP address, but mac address, browser fingerprint, and even hard drive identifier when someone makes a transaction.  
  
If true, that would mean that a VPN on a device that had already legitimately accessed the account would not be sufficient evidence of a hack, and generally make it easier for them to figure out what happened in such instances.
