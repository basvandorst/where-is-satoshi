You can ban links to other threads for a start. That would lower the probability that these sorts of brigades happen by a significant amount.
And sure, bitcoin isn't at all the standard for internet savvy libertarians everywhere, it's just that its demographic is weirdly overrepresented by that group.

Seems like the biggest obstacle is the fact that you guys all go out on downvote brigades and look like total zealots which just widens the divide between potential adoptees. It's sort of like watching an evangelist screaming that someone is going to hell and thinking that's actually going to convince a random passerby of the relative merits of his or her argument.
That's the biggest turn-off for me, at least.

Heh, okay, you've called my bluff. I actually do like the, what, the True Believers (TM) in BTC? There's a lot of good that can come out of cryptocurrency, there's no denying that. There's just this... wall of stuff to get past in order to understand the system that's just so incredibly boring. It doesn't have the same luster to it that something like a good sociology or historiography has, at least for me.
I appreciate the patience, though.

Nope, you can't, and I'm sure you understand why. I get your point about communities but the Bitcoin one seems especially zealous compared to others that I've been a part of and observed. It seems like every single person I know who gets into BTC just will not shut up about it even if it means ramming it into every possible conversation. Plus, look at the thread that's linked. All that downvote shaming, do you really think that's going to convince the owner to adopt BTC? It's just nuts.

I get the enthusiasm but you have to realize that everybody has something that they latch onto in their lives that's bigger than them. How you choose to express your enthusiasm wthe thing is what determines what kind of person you are.
And the brigades don't happen on every sub. That's the difference between a well-moderated sub and one that's laissez-faire about its rules. You can ban this shit if you want to. You can keep your sub from behaving terribly if you choose to, it's not that hard. But I suppose that would go against the ethos of BTC, wouldn't it?

Well, that was pretty much why I never ended up getting into Apple products.
