The money they earn isn't any less real than yours though. And probably more as well.

Or you just get robbed, which is more likely if no one has food and everyone has a motive to choose survival over proper conduct when trading goods and services.

This. Never understood the "but windows is used more" argument as this is just plain false. The majority of the internet runs on Linux and Unix-based machines (routers, etc.) and servers and keep databases with very useful information for hackers. Much more useful information than a single consumer workstation I would argue. Yet, the amount of trouble on Linux/Unix based machines is statistically much lower than on Windows based machines.

Just use an obfuscator or pipe it through Monero with a service like Flyp.Me. (no KYC) or even better; a DEX. Problem solved.
If you buy that ASIC at a store, they still have your details there (and they might be obliged to give it to authorities when requested). Considering you do not buy ASICs for playing Call of Duty at Hi Res (they have a very specific purpose as you might know), its fairly obvious you use it for mining.

This. Would you buy something without validating it is actually there?
Would you buy a car based on me promising the car is actually there and just buy the paper that says it does? 
Bitcoin fixes this. At least if people actually care.

To be fair, if there is a country-wide flood and not everyone built that ark you spoke of, BTC will probably go below 5k again because of a lack of buyers (and a flood of sellers to buy wood and build their own ark).

Yeah, there's no news. Just one of Bitcoin's wild swings. People just like to yell that for, well, no reason really.

No alt so far has been able to solve the most important problem, known as the Blockchain Trilemma. It is the balance between Decentralization, Security and Scalability (or speed). Some existing alt blockchains claim to be more speedy than BTC, but it always comes at the cost of one (or more) of the other factors. Speedy blockchains are usually centralized, giving up on the element of decentralization and security.
We do not have to worry about BTC being replaced until a solution comes around for this blockchain trilemma. BTC strikes the perfect balance between decentralization, speed and security in it's base layer.

In that case you change your pin to something that doesn't contain 1,2,3,4 or 5. Badum tssss... The ultimate decoy.

Because "the wealthy are hoarding Bitcoin" and "the charts never lie".

Love the negative sentiment in here.

And now the dragon is broke.
@_date: 2019-02-02 09:52:43
Well, that makes me happy.

So that would be a double life sentence = 50 years + 40 years = 90 years. Sounds pretty much like a life sentence to me.

But according to legend the coins are locked up till 2020 right?
@_date: 2019-02-02 10:08:36
Never, ever, leave your coins on centralized exchanges people. I am even careful with Binance. Put my LTC on order last night before going to bed, but got so nervous I just withdrew them to my wallet. I'll just wait for a good price, make my trade and GTFO. We really need decent DECENTRALIZED exchanges with smart contracts. IDEX worked quite well for me in the past, but is not exactly user friendly yet.

Profit is still profit. Unless you panic sold... then just ... ouch.
@_date: 2019-02-02 19:22:13
Yeah, it can still happen of course if you are among the very unlucky ones to be there in the hour it goes offline. But at least you can limit your exposure. I agree, it is sad when it happens even while you're careful. We really need decent DEXes and technology to exchange our coins. Whenever humans are added to the equation when it comes to wealth, things way too often go horribly wrong.

It is however kind of ironic we all wanted to control our own money and get away from third parties, but apparently we aren't being able to take care of our own money and now calling for protection by said third parties.
If it wasn't so sad it would be funny.
What we need is decentralized exchanges, not running to the old systems we tried to get away from in the first place. You cannot have a decentralized coin if the infrastructure is not decentralized itself. Thats what this tells me. And we need education, a whole lot of education on how to treat your money responsibly.

If there is such a guy, its a compromise of the Bitcoin network's security. I hope you're kidding because else we have a much bigger problem if someone can just "hack our keys" with some information. In that case I'm selling.

You mean he should teabag the buy wall?
@_date: 2019-02-24 22:15:10
That's actually a great idea!
@_date: 2019-04-03 09:42:01
Not absurd for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-17 11:24:43
Not sure why you're downvoted, but yes, might be true.
