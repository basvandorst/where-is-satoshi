It would be rad to do this with those fake bitcoin physical coins.

Did you listen to the whole thing?  It sounds fairly positive towards decentralized cryptocurrencies and using them legally.  He's mainly speaking against Libra because it's a traditional, centralized institution.

I mean, scripted by who?  The media?  Why would the government script in all the awkward racist questions to themselves when they are called racist literally every minute of every day? :P  The whole media is scripted by Trump to make him look worse?? wut?

It's true, why you gotta downvote?  He never said it was a bad thing.

Why's it gotta matter if he's shy?  Stop the bias against introverts!

Fucking pure bullshit.  It's enough that an LLC costs a minimum of $800 per year in CA and you can't get around it by incorporating in another state if you do business or operate out of CA.  Not to mention the cost of a seller's license, business insurance, etc.  Wow.

What are the transaction hashes of your transactions?  You can check them on a blockchain explorer and see what actually happened.

Dude get rid of that ugly ass coin image.  That's the worst possible bitcoin "coin" image...it looks like fucking copper bullshit.  I don't mind coins representing bitcoin but at least use a luxurious looking gold coin or something not an ugly, cheap copper knock-off coin.  I literally saw that coin at the swap meet and this dude was trying to tell me it had bitcoin loaded on it...it's a cheap ass looking coin.
@_date: 2015-08-26 23:54:41
I can't be assed to take time to refute your claims here one by one, but most of what you have said is BS, FYI.
@_date: 2015-08-28 15:25:27
WTF...I used to trust Roger Ver...did he truly believe he needed to pay 100k for that website or did he just pay off some scammers/do something fishy?  It's so idiotic it is hard to understand that somebody of his intelligent "caliber" could truly, honestly believe 100k was necessary. LOL

What about quantum computers?
@_date: 2015-08-02 08:39:27
It was a legitimate question, I wish someone would enlighten me on the topic.  I know that different groups are working on quantum computers, and I know there have been unstable results...but IMO they are inevitable.  I do not know if they would be able to crack private keys, but it seems like they would be able to...I don't know much about them honestly.  We could increase the size of private keys and such (which I think would help) but the question is how long do we wait before we think about such a thing?  It's just that I could foresee a scenario in a world where cryptocurrency is the norm as cash, and a government or large power develops a quantum computer that is able to infiltrate addresses.
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:31:54
I love bitcoin but I prefer DigitalNote (aka DuckNote/DarkNote) over Monero.  Monero has a poor development team and shitty branding.

@_date: 2018-12-15 20:28:27
Thanks for the positivity...wish I could buy more but if anything I will be forced to sell more at the lowest prices this year.  Hurts so much.  I've been involved for a very long time but I really didn't think that's how this year would be.

I'm so fucking pissed off and I didn't even "lose" any money (just major unrealized gains).  I got a lot out of the last bull market but I'm so upset that I didn't sell more.  This is excruciating and I will have to live like a poor person for the next year now.  I think we are nearing the bottom but I fear it will be $1.8k and that pisses me off even more...I just want to curl up into a ball and die.
