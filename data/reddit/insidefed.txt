Check out USCIS form I-526 pages 5 and 6.  You could list Bitcoin as a source of investment, but you have to show your current investment and committed investment in USD.  So, qualified investment would be in USD, so the bitcoins would need to be cashed out at some point to make this investment.

I've reviewed over 100 balance sheets of banks ranging in size from $20m to $12B and I have never seen more than 1 or 2% of deposits coming in from a central or other bank.  On average I see that 80% of the banks are funded by core deposits.  Core deposits are savings accounts, checking accounts, CD's of less than $250k, and money market accounts.  This is customer deposits.  Some customers are businesses that put their full payroll into the bank, other deposits are multi-millionaires looking for a fixed income of 3% or whatever on long term CDs, yet other deposits are paycheck to paycheck folks.  P.S.  I once was a bank examiner for a federal agency. That doesn't mean I claim to fully understand money supply expansion.  I can tell you that there is always a liability (deposit/borrowing) or capital (startup/retained earnings) that is funding a loan.  The bank must have a deposit on hand in order to take the cash from the deposit to make a loan or to invest it elsewhere, including putting it on deposit at another bank.

1) yes it would, most owners don't have any interest in being criminals, we would sell, and the mention of the word Bitcoin after that would put a huge target on anyone's back as being up to no good.  
  
2) true.. Bitcoin doesn't end, people can still buy and operate in criminal markets.  Criminal markets aren't why Bitcoin is what it is today.  So let me rephrase, the government can't kill the coin, but it can force it to only be part of the dark side that has very limited access to banking or financial markets or even gold.   
  
3)  bitcoin market is not a reflection of a drug market.. not if it's going to get SEC approval.. not if you want it to have any legitimacy whatsoever.  Do you have any numbers that can give me a better indication of bitcoins use in drug trade?  
  
4) ponzi use case.. let me rephrase what I just said in terms that you no doubt agree with.  The value of Bitcoin is linked to its adoption.  Can you possibly refute that?

Not really.  Transactions that are converted to fiat are an admission that the currency (Bitcoin) is completely worthless to the recipient.  In fact, they won't accept Bitcoin unless someone at an exchange is ready to buy.  Bitcoin doesn't make sense as a currency unless an entire nation is dedicated to it being their currency.  For a country to do that, they would have to give up monetary controls.  Seems like an extremely dumb move to me.

It is odd to think that basically only M0 is liquid.  I guess you could say that a deposit account is liquid, but not all deposit accounts can be liquidated at once (as we touched on). 
 
A far as emergency liquidity, in the US, banks can borrow from other banks, the Federal Home Loan Bank, or the Federal Reserve to get contingency funding.  But the funds require collateral, so usually the banks pledge the loan portfolio or investment securities.

1) gov would have no monetary controls, 2) the currency would lack stability needed to do business internationally, 3) a small percentage of people own 50% of Bitcoin and could dump just 10% on the market and take out the value of the country, 4) bitcoin is not suitable for merchant banking (no chargebacks) and 5) also not suitable for lending (crazy value fluctuations).

I think the real question is, who is using it as a currency and why?  If it's because people want to make anonymous transactions in the black market, as is often preached, then those users are toxic to those who want Bitcoin to have a good reputation to store value as digital gold.

I work in the banking sector and issuing debt is different than making loans.  Issuing debt is when a bank borrows money from another entity.  In the US, we have the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve's discount window.  Banks also borrow from each other thru credit lines.  Making loans requires a bank to have liquidity, whether it's money borrowed from the aforementioned entities, or for most banks, the money their customers have deposited.  For example, if a small bank is $100 million in size, with a 10% tier 1 capital ratio, that basically means they have initial investment plus retained earnings that represent $10 million and the remaining 90% is funded by loans or those borrowings.  Let's say that the bank starts with all $100 million in cash (it doesn't work that way, but just go with the example).  After purchasing buildings and software and such, they might have $90 million to invest.  If they can make good quality loans, they do so.  The remaining amount of cash that isn't in vaults and teller drawers is usually invested in government guaranteed securities (agency bonds, treasuries, and munis).  I think it's a common misperception that a bank can just ramp up its balance sheet by making loans out of government printed money.  It's true that they can borrow from the Discount Window at the Federal Reserve and lend that out, but in actuality, the Discount Window is the lender of last resort and it looks terrible to investors if the bank is relying on the discount window as the ability for a bank to build and maintain a deposit base is a huge factor that plays into its market value.  If the discount rate (Fed Funds rate) goes up to 3% again, banks can still offer less than 1% in savings accounts.  If you multiply the spread by the estimated life of the deposit account you get the value of the deposit (well, you need to go one step further and discount the cash flows, but the simple version is easier to understand).  Fractional reserve banking does increase the money supply because if I put $1,000 in a bank and keep it there, and someone borrows that cash from the bank and puts it in their deposit account, we now have $2,000 in recorded savings, and this can keep going like this for up to 10x or so based on the reserve requirement as you were discussing.  The thing that confuses me about the position that fractional reserve banking is giving banks too much power or something is that if I take my $1,000 out, the bank has to convert an asset into cash to pay me off.  Banks maintain balance sheet liquidity (investments, cash, deposits in Federal Reserve) to pay out deposit withdrawals.  So it's not like they are lending any money that they haven't obtained.  Basically, if bitcoins are ever lent out, it becomes a fractional reserve system.  What nation would not want loans to be made?  I think Islam and some other religions oppose usury (interest) but allow fees, so they have banks that lend.  
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:37:15
Thanks for pointing me to this.  I reviewed it and I have identified the flaw in its reasoning.  It assumes that the loan is essentially undisbursed.  He takes a $200k loan and keeps it in his deposit account, therefore the bank grows in size by $200k ("money out of thin air").  That's not actual borrower behavior however and it's not logical either.  Borrowers that want funds to be available to them, but not right away, take out borrowing lines.  They don't pay 5% or more to have cash sit in an account that pays less than 1%.  
  
In reality, if he's borrowing that $200k to pay for a house, the bank wires $200k in cash to the seller.  This means that loans increase by $200k and cash decreases by $200k for zero net asset (balance sheet) growth.  
  
Let's say the borrower takes cash out and puts it on deposit at another bank, maybe as a high-yielding CD that pay 6%, then the money supply has increased as expected due to the fractional reserve method (which the author rejects).  
  
Make sense?
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:49:59
There is this thing called money laundering.  Forgive me if you already understand it, but t's when you pay someone a premium to take your unlawfully obtained cash (dirty money), put it in their bank, and wire it to your account.  This makes the cash "clean" again, as it is now back in the legitimate banking system and you can then wire it to the Cayman Islands and attempt to avoid paying taxes on the income (no tax documents would be filed that you would need to report on your return).  Well, if you buy bitcoins from this ATM, you can then sell the bitcoins at the exchange for electronic USD that can then be wired to your bank account.  
@_date: 2017-05-15 05:31:13
The US government allows its citizens to purchase anything they want, so long as it's not illegal.  It is legal to buy bitcoins, so you are in the clear.  When you purchase bitcoins on Coinbase, you have a user profile that can be retrieved by the government with a warrant if they have reason to believe that you are participating in illegal activities.  So, don't break the law and you are good to go.

Bitcoin is not a threat to any national currencies at this time.  The market cap of baseball cards exceeds bitcoin.  No one takes it seriously at the government level.  And even "when" they do, it will be no more than as an Internet based gold alternative that a community of less than a million people have agreed upon has value.

1) I highly doubt central banks view bitcoin as anything but a novelty internet application.  If this were the case, you would see public position papers written about the threat of cryptocurrency on the USD (for example).  
  
2)It doesn't take $4 billion to increase market cap to $4 billion.  In fact, if I start a new coin today with a billion initial coins and I was able to sell just one for $4, my coin's market cap would be $4 billion at the point of that trade.  
  
3)  I don't know anything about ripple, sorry.

Banks will not be lending in Bitcoin until a nation can stabilize its value by increasing and decreasing its supply.  To rephrase, Bitcoin is not suitable for lending.  Cool, you can check your balance at a bank.  Guess what?  They aren't taking your balance as a deposit.

@_date: 2017-05-17 17:05:09
I don't understand what you mean by full reserve.  To me, full reserve means that of the bitcoins they have available to lend, they must reserve 100%.  This would mean they couldn't make any loans.  To rephrase, all assets are fully reserved to reimburse depositors upon request, therefore no monies are being lent out.  Mt. Gox didn't lend, but they did "misplace" bitcoins, so they were not fully reserved.  Poloneix seems to be a P2P loan listing service, and if I were to borrow a bitcoin from someone on there, they would be taking credit risk based on my worthiness to repay them.  Someone who lends a bitcoin for 2 days would not be able to withdraw this amount until they are repaid by the borrower.  This is essentially a 0% reserve and it doubles the money supply from 1 bitcoin (one on account as a deposit) to 2 bitcoins (one being borrowed, one on account as a deposit).  Do you agree/disagree?  
  
Banks and Lending: The discount window is available to borrow from on an emergency basis only and must be collateralized by bank assets (loans/securities).  IndyMac and Washington Mutual failed due to liquidity collapse (ran out of cash).  If anyone can borrow anytime from the discount window, these banks would have.  
  
When a bank lends to another, it is considered an interest bearing balance (like a deposit) at the Fed Funds rate and goes by the name of Fed Funds Sold (for lending bank) or Fed Funds Purchased (for borrowing bank).  The accounting is more like a deposit instead of a borrowing because the deposits are overnight loans (automatic renewal) as opposed to an FHLB borrowing that might have a maturity of one or more years.  I don't know about the netting feature you refer to.  I know for a fact that this isn't happening in banks less than $10B.  
  
I will check out TARGET2. We had a TARP and one other government assistance program during the crisis that propped up capital levels even though the funds were borrowed money from the government.  Instead of listing the TARP borrowing as a liability, the provisions of the TARP allowed banks to record it as a capital injection.  
  
I enjoyed your response.

If you care about the long term interest in Bitcoin, whether you transact in it or not, you will want the government and everyday people to know what it is.  Right now, explaining Bitcoin to people gets confusing and can take up to 30 minutes depending on how many questions they have.  Or you can just say, it's basically Internet gold, but instead of carrying around valuable gold coins in your pocket during the zombie apocalypse, you can access your savings in a phone app.  End story.  Or you can say, it's currency, people around the world are buying it so they can buy things with it.  The inevitable question that follows is "well what can I buy with it that I can't buy with the currency everyone else, including myself, already uses?"  My response: "Drugs, prostitutes, and hit men over the internet.  Want to learn more?"  Seriously though.. that is the answer.  
@_date: 2017-05-15 14:58:32
True, it just makes you someone who is breaking the law, and law abiding citizens generally choose not to do that.  That's fine, you can be in the underground camp.  Consider me in the above the law Internet gold camp.  Gold isn't used as currency anywhere, but it generally holds value.  I'm hoping that Bitcoin can continue to capture market share vs gold in its ability to store value.  So yes, I care about the price, and if it goes up over the long run, that is preferable.  I don't have to worry about the tax man finding out that I am not reporting gains when I use Bitcoin, do you?
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:50:29
Bitcoin is ready for mainstream if the people who think it's best use is as a currency would give it up already.  Those like me who think bitcoin is digital gold could care less if it takes 3 days for our coinbase purchases to process.  All we care is that enough people agree that bitcoin has value and that it is actively traded on exchanges to establish that value and to allow for people to enter and exit the market easily.

Who is getting paid in it, being taxed in it, willing to back it with their military, or willing to lend in it?  Just because you call something a currency doesn't make it one.  It's bartering digital gold.  There is a huge difference.  You can go by a much simpler definition than the one most people in the world go by (money that is issued by a nation) and call it a currency because it is a "medium of exchange."  But why add that confusion?  Why push for people use Bitcoin in commerce?  Why encourage people to subject their paycheck into something that has so much volatility that it may as well be a casino game under the guise of currency rather than investment?  Literally anything makes the cut as a currency under "medium of exchange," as long as all parties agree that the medium has a certain value.  
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:55:19
Yeah, I have researched the accounting and indeed, when a bank makes a loan, it also credits a deposit account for the borrower in the same amount without touching cash or reserves.  At this point M1 increases.  What is interesting to me is that M1 is increased by the loan agreement even if the bank has no cash or excess reserves to fund the loan (is insolvent).  So literally, they can create money, but not create liquidity.  If the bank was running low on cash, it couldn't just lend $10m to an employee (Non-Reg O) and use the proceeds of that money in the employees deposit account to pay out deposit withdrawals.  Instead, the bank would need cash to do that and would get it by liquid asset conversion or borrowing from the central bank or other banks.  That just throws me for a loop that the money a bank created by making a loan is not money that can be used to pay for anything (unless the bank has cash to fund its use).

I'm not convinced that they have adequate hedging capabilities either.  Consider that I place an order for 1 Bitcoin at $2,500.  It's going to take 3 days before this amount is withdrawn from my bank account.  What if I have $0 in my bank account and Bitcoin has plummeted from $2,500 to $1,500.  Coinbase is stuck holding the bag.  They lose $1,000 because they bought a coin from the market at $2,500 and held it for me, but I can't pay for it.  The ETF doesn't exist yet, there are not enough options on the market, how will Coinbase stay solvent during a downturn?  They did it in '14, so maybe they know something that I don't.  I'm guessing that they started out with a nice stockpile of coins to begin with.  As that pile goes down, they will be carrying more risk (of capital insolvency).

What percentage of bitcoin transactions are estimated to come from Japanese, Chinese, or Indian people?  Do we know? Or do we just set up an exchange in someone's garage in those countries and claim that Bitcoin is a massively global movement?  If I started an exchange in my house in the US, would I be in any trouble if I said that it was a South African exchange?  I don't think there are laws against that.
