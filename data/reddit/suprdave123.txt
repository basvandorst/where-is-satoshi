How could the crypto market NOT be manipulated? The Top 8 Cryptos ALL dumped 8-10% simultaneously...not in reaction to one another...Just 'the lords share' peeled off the top of the entire market. How can one trade to cash do that?

It's like someone pushed a button and gapped down the entire crypto market at once...

You mean Bag Hodler's and Knife Catchers?

Where do you plan on finding new idiots to dump new money in if all the ones who did last year got completely wiped out?

Nah, I think Peter is just fine...lol.

Reminds me of a Friend who played Catch the Knife with Fannie and Freddie Stock and his Life Savings leading upto 2008..pretty sure he's still HODLing those Shares waiting for them to go back upto 60 Bux again...$1.15 currently.

Amazon is a company with Quarterly Earnings...the only 'earnings' of Bitcoin is finding a greater fool to trade you more Dollars for your Nearly Useless, Volatile Crypto Tokens.

Anyone who bought coins low and wasn't selling them into the Mania to 19k is kinda silly. There's not much chance of new suckers coming in to pump it back up there. Plenty of people bought in at 5k+ and got washed...or traded their gains for ALTs and got washed and still owe IRS on their 2017 gains.

Most Wealthy people didn't get that way by trading their 'few millions' for Digital Tokens and a Hoop Dream...especially an 'asset' that's completely retraced it's bubble gains from a year ago.

You don't get burned selling to Cash and re-buying...you get burned HODLing a Crypto Token while it drops to Zero.

What makes you think that HODL-ers, HODL-ing creates a price floor? Price Floors come from Bids...There's someone bag hodling ENRON stock still.

If you look at the charts, people have been cashing out since the Peak...lots of caught Knives on the way down. What if HODLing was a Confidence Game to create the Greater Fool?
