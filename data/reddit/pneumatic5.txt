i actually thought that first, but i though it wasnt clearly referring to btc enough, so i used the c instead of the s.

And I feel bad throwing away all the btc I mined on satoshi dice. All 0.2 btc....i cant even imagine how you must feel. I feel tgough that the motto of bitcoin is that you dont gamble/invest in btc what you cant live without. In this instance you gambled your marriage. I want to console you, but you made a selfish decision.

You should try investing in some funds like some of the assets at havelock,bitfunder, and btct. If you know what your doing you can easily make thousands. Hell I made 2k from 2 btc, and I have no idea what im doing.

If were doing hypotheticals would a bajillion USD worth of BTC be a better one? :D

bitcoin brokers is good, and its only cash deposits to banks like BoA and chase, with no seller fees and has escrow for you. you also choose the price you want to sell it at.

the least is 0.01 i think for havelock, 0.1 for bitfunder, and im not sure with btct. Those are the minimum to transfer into the site. But you can start trading with 0.001, a lot of assets are that cheap.

This is also assuming that theres no electoral vote portion, cause then we would need more information on the voters disctricts.

yea i was considering placing all, albeit few, of the bitcoins I have into asic pt shares, but I reconsidered. But from what I did put in, I too made a profit :D.

The PT shares are both ran by the same person TAT (Thickasthieves), but I originally bought the shares at havelock, it was just easier to deposit coins. The bitfunder way is a little extra step with weex, but it does add some more security. They are both really trustworthy, as ThickasThieves and Ukyo are always on the bitcointalk forums and are trusted members in the securities forums.
