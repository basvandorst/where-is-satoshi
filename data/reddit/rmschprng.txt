So then it is possible to be a cryptocurrency **investor**.  Read the whitepaper, familiarize yourself with the company staff, attempt to map out use cases and price projections compared to the ecosystem surrounding it.  
Or gamble on shillcoins.  Just don't confuse the two.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:58:17
In that case, I'm going all-in on Bitconnect!
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:59:28
That's because it's a combination of the two.  You could say the same of investing in traditional stocks.  Some people hear about a stock on the up-and-up and buy in at the top, losing money in the short term.  Some people do due diligence, research the company, and review business statements from previous quarters.  Are both those people gambling, or is one of them investing?

For those coins, he's just showing you their future value.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:30:15
You probably shouldn't.

Nothing says bubble like poor meme support.  Hold on to your hats.

I just re-financed my house to get in.  I can't deal with this shit I'm freaking out

The most committed holders likely have their Bitcoin on a private key, so yes there would be quite a delay in sending that funding to the exchange.  Anyone who has their funds on the exchange could sell instantly, if they could find a buyer.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:14:22
Oh, right.  I forgot for a second that only developers jailbreak their phones.
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:20:01
If you want a serious answer, you've already fucked up in a couple of ways.  If you have no interest in selling anytime soon, keeping it on an exchange is inefficient.  In the case of today, and likely today only, you cost yourself... 200 dollars?  Very tough to speculate that number until about 5 hours from now when the Bitcoin fork occurs.  If you kept your Bitcoin on a private wallet, you'd now have two versions of Bitcoin.  By giving your Bitcoin to a bank, you gave them the money.

Unfortunately people don't need a jumbo jet, and pretty soon they won't need Bitcoin either.
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:28:10
I mean, those are just silly buzzwords.  Unfortunately the repeated schisms in Bitcoin philosophy are causing it to be quickly left behind.  If it weren't for the brand recognition it would be relatively useless.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:56:43
I genuinely don't know what you're referring to.
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:06:39
Amen.  Keep fighting the good fight out there.
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:40:17
I'm even younger, and do the same.  Years later, when I realized that my style was unusual, I chose to keep it as a relic of the elders who taught me.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:10:28
... are you serious? Why do you think jailbreaking even exists?
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:06:47
I honestly don't know what you're referring to. Ethereum? Far from its high.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:27:13
When Bitcoin's competitors surpassed them in transaction speed and negligible fees, loyalists restructured the intrinsic value of BTC to digital gold to enable their narrative.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:41:43
I mean, you don't know how to speak English properly.  Maybe you shouldn't be so quick to dismiss traditional schooling.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:26:29
Your loss. A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:46:56
I can't figure out what kind of math you did in that first sentence. You know there are 7 billion people... right?
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:49:42


It goes to 7 billion people. That's what evenly means.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:16:37
Thanks for the explanation.  It couldn't have been worded in a more confusing manner.
Don't do what Donny Don't does, as they say.
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:53:51
Could you explain why you feel Bitcoin has a bigger/better developer community than Ethereum?  It would seem that they churn through updates much faster and have a huge base of people building dApps.
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:53:36
You have a lot of reading to do.
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:37:57
You heavily implied that you thought implementing these features in Bitcoin was a workable plan, then admitted that Monero has already solved these problems.  Really no need for the technical jargon and obfuscation of your initial point.  There are already tumbling systems in place, and zkSTARKs incoming for Ethereum, so why do I need Bitcoin, again?
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:35:09
I realize this is semantics, but isn't almost everything easier said than done?
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:11:04
I don't believe that Bitcoin has plans to implement any of those in the near future, with the exception of Lightning, which is in itself a measure of increased transparency.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:12:28
Just curious, but how do the swaths of lost coins affect its ability to be a currency?  I always hear horror stories of people throwing out hard drives with 200 coins on them.
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:03:16
In what world is your transactional history private? Do you understand the words "distributed ledger"?
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:47:42
At least he's still smiling!
