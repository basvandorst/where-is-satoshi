Thanks for your reply Renben9! Much appreciated. I am curious about how the printer would store this. 
Guess it can not store infinite amount of data? When removing the RAM (it's not called like this in a printer but you know what i mean) it only prints one page and says "out of memory". 
It’s a really old hp laserjet, don’t know if this counts as "smart" but it definitely has some OS (there is an interface with buttons and LCD display). 
When printing from Tails one can only use certain Printers and I was happy to have this compatible one.
What you say about writing it by hand is true — but starts getting messy if you have multiple seeds/passphrases and other stuff you want to write down securely. I need a more structured option. I will keep on researching about the printers memory. thank you.

sure it also feels a bit oversized to me too. but how bad would this scenario be: its 2035 — You held your btc for ages and it appears to be super valuable. you realize that someone emptied your address with the seed u printed on hp laserjet 5000 in 2019 before dumping it in 2021. :)
