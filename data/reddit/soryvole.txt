Nice article!
Does it mean that if I set up a company in Slovenia or Portugal then I can convert bitcoin to fiat without paying taxes?

Thank you!
I would like to see more of these great realizations.
I want to thank all the developers who are pushing the blockchain among the ordinary people.

It would be good to publish a list of merchants in each of these cities.

This is a time of panic selling.
Whales waiting for cheap bitcoins. They have time enough.

SCAM  -  for sure!
Who wants to buy a 15,000 bitcoin from you if there is possibility to  buy it at  11,200 by exchange office? Just a thief!

Just kidding! It does not matter what the price is!
A long-term goal is important! And that's clear! HODL!!

Your theory is against mathematics and greedy of financial groups. Bitcoin is doomed to grow!

I would like to know this: If I have both double coins after fork is there some time limit for spending them in one or second chain. Can I wait for clarification of situation with both coins long time?
