Huh? I sold all my BTC at 17000. The only thing left to "sell" (more accurately put: "buy" to close out my position) is my relatively small short margin position against BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:52:12
Unless you realise the underlying condition is different. The price surge was due to futures speculators buying up Bitcoin to inflate prices. Then they take out futures contracts against BTC and dump their BTC.

Inflation is what drives lending and growth. Many people will join the unemployment line if there’s huge incentive to put money under the mattress rather than spending it and allowing people to work for the money. Whether money is global has absolutely no bearing on this fundamental truth.

You have no idea how institutional money works if you think big mutual funds and the likes are allowed to invest in HIGHLY speculative asset classes like cryptocurrency. It is, quite literally, illegal for them to gamble the funds like that.

There are opportunities, and then there are bubbles. The early days of industrialization, the growth of the oil industry, the tech sector and many startups can have incredible growth. But give me an actual, data supported example of one where the growth is 2000%+ a year, not an answer that claims there are lots out there without an actual example.
If there isn’t, then you have a very simple statistical problem: is this a bubble, like every single thing that grows as fast as BTC and basically all cryptos this year? Or is this the first time in documented history where there’s legitimately such a high sustainable growth? Which is statistically more likely to be the case?
Interesting that you mention Black Swan, as the author was highly critical of most models, especially ones that discount (or fail to understand) the disproportionally influential effects of black swan events.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:06:37
Almost down to 50%. Are we ready to admit this is a bubble?

When someone claims 100% confidence, especially in something as unpredictable as crypto prices, you know you shouldn’t take that person seriously at all.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:18:42
Yes, the price would be locked in, regardless of the movement of BTC price.

There’s impenetrable support at $0!

A lot on r/Bitcoin are informed by their own ideology rather than rationality. Some bought in at 15k+ and are exercising their wishful thinking of infinite gains. And then there are some who are lying through their teeth about holding while dumping their stack.
Also, no one cares about the proper use of upvotes and downvotes, and wrongly believe downvote is used for posts they disagree with.

Does the government allow other entities to mint new currency? If not, why do you believe governments will allow Bitcoin or alts to be used as currency when the state can make their own using blockchain technology and monopolize the market by regulating its competitors?

Spending drives the economy. Saving does not. Ever heard of a liquidity trap?
Edit: it's replies like this that worry me. So many crypto investors lack even a basic understanding of economics and finance, and think their luck gives them special insights.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:14:58
This is uncharted territory. Given that models can fail spectacularly even for well understood assets, any model of fair value for cryptos can only be, at best, a shot in the dark. So my answer is I don't know.
Which obviously raises the question: "Then how do you know Bitcoin is in a bubble, without some model to explain what's it real value is?". My answer would be: Find me a single instance of an asset going up in value by more than 2000% within a year that isn't a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:16:42
What point are you trying to make? Obviously Arachnocentric is not saying 30% is a big dip; the point of discussion is whether there will be a bigger drop (aka a crash) coming.
Seems you've missed the entire point of the discussion.

This person is comforting himself.
The issue with most crypto layman is that they think people working in finance are idiots. Do people really think the recent huge increase in BTC price (which has a huge market cap and volume, therefore harder to pump than a small coin) isn't due to certain entities pumping up the price to later make a killing shorting through futures and selling their BTCs?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:19:17
Wow. Do people on r/Bitcoin really believe this? Pension funds almost always pick AAA bonds to invest in because they’re safe, and people actually believe pension funds are going to gamble pensioners retirement money on cryptos, which is riskier than even junk bonds?
Comments like this would scare away any intelligent investor.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:14:06
Good to see that a drop brings out all the crazies.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:55:22
This is why I laugh whenever people claim to be “diversified” in a bunch of different cryptos.

I didn’t get into the nitty gritty for the sake of brevity. Equity is ownership in a business with real assets. The fact that you have to depend on others to be willing to purchase it is true (which is why volume is important), but that’s just a trivially true fact for literally everything. There is nothing backing the value of Bitcoins; there are real assets and revenue generated by the companies issuing stocks.
There are clear examples of bond defaulting, but I never said bonds never default, simply that it’s extremely uncommon, especially if we’re talking about the most traded bond (US treasury bills). In comparison, a company going bankrupt is much more likely, and the risk of crypto is even higher than that.
Finally, I don’t think Bitcoin will fail and go to $0. That’s absurd. But anyone who thinks anything near the current price level is remotely sustainable is crazy. If Bitcoin doesn’t get outlawed or out competed by state issued cryptos (and that’s a big if), maybe Bitcoin would be justified at this price in 5-10 years.

Yes, institutional investors are totally coming for a piece of the highly speculative crypto market, where exchanges frequently go down under load. Can’t see how any of that can possibly go wrong, and I’m sure investors in those funds will be perfectly understanding when things go south. In fact, funds might as well start leveraging their portfolio 10x to make even regular stocks exciting. That is totally what funds are looking for.

You can settle your contract at any time by taking out another futures contract.

What logic? He’s clearly wrong.
Bitcoin will repeat it’s past history and increase in price infinitely and reach prices in excess of 100 trillion dollars per 0.0001 BTC.

Guess you weren't here for the Bitcoin drop from 1k to ~200 that lasted years.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:12:07
Stocks, bonds and forex markets have good reasons for their valuation. Stocks are equity in companies that perform. Bonds are loans made to states that generally do not default on their debt obligations. Forex trades on state backed currency. These markets serve important purposes in our society.
Bitcoin does not. It is not state backed, and it definitely fails as a currency (no currency should be deflationary; that promotes people not to spend, the exact opposite reason for why currency was created). Many countries and banks are looking to create their own virtual currency using blockchain technology. When that happens, there's absolutely no reason why bitcoin will benefit.
The price right now rides on nothing but speculation, and it will absolutely crash. The question is when. (Although I think long term Bitcoin will still hold some value, barring more legislative pressure)

If you trade frequently (more than once every 6 months), you do not qualify for capital gains tax. It will be treated as income tax since you're day trading in the eyes of the IRS.
If you sell to lock in gains or to buy the dip, you have just realised your gains and it becomes taxable. It doesn't matter if you don't withdraw it, once you trade it for fiat (or fiat equivalent, like Tether) in your account it's a taxable event.
Basically this is the first serious attempt by the government to collect taxes due for crypto gains. In the short term this is probably going to cause a price drop (in addition to the fact that we've had a very long rally, so a correction is due anyways. This will magnify it).
In the long run, this clearly signifies that crypto is becoming big enough that governments are taking it seriously. May be good for price long term (if they don't legislate the hell out of crypto).
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:04:31
If you don't trigger a taxable event, then you don't have to pay taxes. e.g. If you are purely holding and never once tried to sell to buy the dip or alts, then it's not taxable yet.

Like I said. It's backordered for an entire month (in fact, the Ledger Nano S was backordered until the start of June just last week, now it's moved back another month), and you all think they're going to want MORE demand for a reduced price? That's pretty wishful thinking, and completely ignores how supply and demand works.
What they should do is to increase price, so that inventory can keep up, and they can increase profits, then invest those profits to scale up production, then reduce price after.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:21:02
So... All the hardware wallet manufacturers are having trouble keeping up with demand for their product, and people think offering them MORE buyers at a reduced price will be an attractive proposition?
Are you guys serious?
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:34:47
What's actually going to happen is pant up demand will go through the inventory almost instantly (seeing as more and more people are getting into cryptocurrency and would like to protect their investments), and then we see another month before more stock. Rinse and repeat, until at some point (who knows when) supply catches up to demand.
People in the cryptocurrency space are making insane gains everyday. Stop being cheap and just pre-order at retail price. Protect your investment instead of trying to save what? $10 at best?
Don't be the guy who got scammed; it could've been completely prevented had he gotten a hardware wallet.
