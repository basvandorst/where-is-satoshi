ha, been down that road.  I aint got any shit left!  All good though.  When some near smoke clears I plan to get some more bitcoin, maybe upwards of .1 if I'm lucky.
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:28:26
Wish I had ways to do side jobs directly for Bitcoin, especially at these prices.  I'm cash poor right now (for a number of reasons), but gosh dang I know I'm going to regret not finding a way to get more during this period of time.
@_date: 2018-09-20 04:42:44
True, I won't argue with you.  I have a lot of assets, a home, cars, etc.  What I mean to say is I'm not crying broke, but wish I had cash to put into this.  I don't, and funds are quite tight.  So okay, yeah I'm poor.
@_date: 2018-09-01 06:43:47
Cash app has been giving me better rates for some time now.
@_date: 2018-05-02 17:15:57
...but I was asking curumimxara about his 1% that aren't Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-30 03:34:28
I'm not judging you at all. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:09:15
Dang man, I'm probably gonna be dead by then
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:47:17
I am not a fan of that scenario
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:11:51
I need 0.25 more BTC before it takes off again, but I've run out of stuff to sell! Payday just doesn't come fast enough.
@_date: 2018-05-31 22:56:24
Bro, I struggle to buy .01 BTC at a time!
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:30:56
I took the FOMO route this morning.  Bye bye paycheck.
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:15:52
I do both on the same GPU all the time.  Shut down mining when I play, start it back up when I'm done.  
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:46:02
I'm not sure about ETH.  They got a lot riding on PoS.
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:08:20
CONGRATS!  You're officially a whole coiner!
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:12:34
Is a lot bro
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:43:24
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:14:54
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:06:10
I agree with you on this.  I'd also be curious to know which coins you find to be in that 1%.
@_date: 2018-05-15 17:50:22
Yes to everything you've said
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:23:04
The next time you see me I will be selling skin care products and posting anti-Trump memes.  Because of my friend.
@_date: 2018-05-17 21:56:54
You know what ... let them sell.  Who do you think is going to come back to buy in again down the road?  Sell, sell, sell....Imma do my thing.
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:17:17
Dreaming is great, planning is better.  Having .25 BTC at that age is tremendous ... hope he keeps his foot to the pedal and turns it into 1.0 or more by the time he's 25.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:16:55
Nope, when you use Robinhood you're investing in Bitcoin but you haven't "purchased" it.  Stays with Robinhood.
@_date: 2018-05-18 21:01:59
I mean, yeah I'll take the option if it's presented..but that's a far cry from livin!
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:28:29
No, dude....no
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:01:55
If they didn't do this you wouldn't stop to buy ice cream either, you old curmudgeon. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 16:57:53
Bcash is a shitcoin, many others are up to debate and speculation
@_date: 2018-05-09 20:52:06
Good data, next halvening is going to reduce supply quite a bit though.
@_date: 2018-05-19 05:18:19
You got about a month until you run out of time. Get on it!
@_date: 2018-05-15 13:11:09
And how would one go about selling an older account?  Asking for a friend.
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:34:55
of which year?
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:07:25


In such a scenario, what are your first few moves?
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:16:20
The general planning shot closer to 60 than 70
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:28:35
Some blockchain sites aren't segwit compatible.  Make sure the one you are using is.
@_date: 2018-05-30 02:08:46
Don't sell it. Use it or hodl it! 
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:07:44
lenny stahp it
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:19:27
And what are these "sites" you speak of? My friend would like to know.
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:06:25
I was with you on the first three, but I'm rolling the dice on the fourth.  Somebody can hodl my rubbers, because I'm going in.
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:27:19
Why are you posting the same thing daily?  We saw it already.
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:13:02
So would it be crazy to sell off ETH and just hold more BTC?
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:25:16
What are your favorite crypto podcasts?
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:38:20
Yep, that's true. I convert all my mined ETH for BTC at a decent rate (using 580s)
@_date: 2018-05-06 01:04:18
When 1 BTC = 10 M?
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:51:19
We missed you!
@_date: 2018-05-10 20:40:44
We'll cross it.  Will we hold it?
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:02:34
Bring it, Brussels!  Just don't bring any of your goddamn aluminum with you!
@_date: 2018-05-16 16:00:49
by that logic after such a transformational change we'll be 1 generation removed from something that looks exactly as it does now.
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:27:09
do it
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:17:15
Now is the time.
@_date: 2018-05-16 16:56:12
The normalization of Bitcoin continues. Ryan Seacrest on "Live with Kelly and Ryan" just made a joke about Gelman being so prepared with money that he carries Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:15:03
I'm one of those idiots!
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:21:17
Shoot, well done getting to 1.5 though!  I wish I could put in that much each check, I'm still under a whole coin.  Keep that pace up though!
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:31:23
He asked for a summary, not your own personal opinion.
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:46:07
@_date: 2018-05-07 22:32:10
Stop worrying about being offended and live your life.  You're insulted by a headline?  Don't take it so personally.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:25:53
I keep hesitating the move, and now I am on the fence.  Do I really want to accept these losses now and move back to full BTC, or do I weather the storm in the hopes that the alts pick up steam and outgain BTC on the recovery and then make the move.  My paralysis on this decision has been costly.
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:51:38
No, don't do that
@_date: 2018-05-18 04:24:46
anymore?  Shit dude nobody's read those since the early 90s.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:15:50
Savor the sweet dip for me.  I bit on the run up to 10k.  Gosh damnit!
@_date: 2018-05-17 19:41:36
Oh they don't hold the amount their issuing?  If so that's wild
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:33:02
They'll join when it's easy to do so and adds clear value to their lives (not promises).  Fortunately, that feels like it's getting closer and closer by the day.
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:24:30
Yeah I woke up and saw the charts, FOMOed so hard.  Gone up a good stretch since then!
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:40:29
This is just buying paper bitcoin.  If it's stuck on an exchange I'd beware.
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:20:57
It's just a marketing gimmick.
@_date: 2018-05-02 17:21:13
It was a really good one though!
@_date: 2018-05-15 17:09:06
been ready for a month!
@_date: 2018-05-04 21:29:13
Alright, so now you gotta go all the way with your prediction.  What year will we see the Laggards?
@_date: 2019-03-14 15:20:30
Can. not. wait!
Lightning network is coming along so nicely, but still a long way to go.  We'll get there.
@_date: 2019-03-06 23:16:40
If it makes you feel better I can give you my BTC address.  I'll hold it for you as a security consultant. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 22:54:34
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:59:15
If you don't want to spend money and looking for something she can use on her phone Samurai is great.  If you don't want it to be in a hot wallet a standard paper wallet is free and tremendous (plus a great way to learn from a basic level of function).
If you post the way she'd like to use bitcoin and any potential wallet budget the options expand a ton.
@_date: 2019-03-06 21:08:36
You got that many dollars?  Good on you dude!
@_date: 2019-03-11 17:29:56
So how do you actually do this, even by error I'm unsure how such a thing happens
@_date: 2019-03-18 21:30:03
Oh okay, so get to 2.1 and then wait.  Target set!
@_date: 2019-03-22 14:47:42
Welcome dude.  If you have any questions about storage there are tons of wonderful resources around here.  As you get excited about crypto it will be tempting to get a bunch of shitcoins, but if you're wise you'll just increase that BTC. :)
@_date: 2019-03-18 21:57:41
It means they'll use JPM Coin
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:39:42
It wasn't me who downvoted.  I don't know how to prove that, but I upvote every tip I see.
@_date: 2019-03-08 22:01:29
Nearly 2 BTC on your phone.  Hot damn homie!
@_date: 2019-03-12 17:39:56
Well there's a link I'm definitely not clicking.
@_date: 2019-03-08 18:53:11
Daaaaaaaang!  Do you ever think about how you'll look back at the satoshi's donated and think about how much it is in the year 2035? :)
@_date: 2019-03-15 18:45:41
The amount of hatred I have for /s as it compares to my hatred for Bcash.  It might just surpass the Bcash hatred!
Also, that's not my name.
@_date: 2019-03-18 21:14:09
...and then!?
@_date: 2019-03-02 19:36:56
@_date: 2019-03-08 22:21:07
We are so close!  Agreed that we aren't there yet though.
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:02:58
Paypal-to-paypal can be done just as fast.  It's not just that it's speed as a measurement, it's that you can take a premier asset like Bitcoin and send it just as fast and cheap as you can your shitcoin or the paypal trash.  It's absolutely game changing.
@_date: 2019-03-06 22:53:01
Holy shit.  That's big league.  Nice!
@_date: 2019-03-19 21:14:42
Price prediction for the end of 2021?
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:08:11
Okie doke.
@_date: 2019-03-11 21:54:56
wtf, get out
@_date: 2019-03-12 22:12:48


Seems to me you'd owe this sucker 30-50

TFTC podcast
@_date: 2019-03-18 21:46:00
I just got a chill down my spine.  Would LOVE that!  That's too ambitious to even be a goal of mine, but good on all of those that strive for that today.
@_date: 2019-03-06 23:58:42
Wait, what?
@_date: 2019-03-09 02:01:26
I'm very bad with language and it's clear my intention wasn't received well (see the other conversation).  It was meant as an atta-boy.  Thank you for what you're doing! 
@_date: 2019-03-08 19:03:05
He runs publicly traded platforms, why would he open source that?
@_date: 2019-03-08 20:30:45
I'll pass on the bait.  Have a great weekend bud!
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:15:55
Ah, that's the Andreas I know and love! ♥
@_date: 2019-03-12 17:36:13
HODL them or spend them
@_date: 2019-03-14 16:30:40
I don't hate /s as much as I hate Bcash, but it's getting closer and closer by the day.
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:01:21
I have sent lightning, but did my first peer-to-peer today.  Unbelievable experience.  Instant and was 'free'.
@_date: 2019-03-11 17:31:35
Sure you can.  r/pmsforsale - great community.
@_date: 2019-03-05 20:54:29
Tales from the Crypt.  Great podcast.
@_date: 2019-03-08 22:02:44
There isn't a more fun way to gift bitcoin than on an opendime
@_date: 2019-03-04 18:45:58
You just pass those satoshis over here and I'll click it for you!
@_date: 2019-03-06 23:18:06
What the heck?
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:24:56
You misunderstand, I'm just pointing to the generosity.  It was meant to be a statement of support.  I use and buy more all the time.  
Having said that, good on people like u/binarygold - I'm just always taken aback by the tremendous generosity 
@_date: 2019-11-25 02:16:19
Which update is supposed to add hardware wallet compatibility to the bitcoin core client directly?
@_date: 2018-10-03 17:13:42
I'll take the under.
@_date: 2018-10-21 20:50:32
393 more days
@_date: 2018-10-23 22:51:42
What account were you posting from?  It wasn't this one from what I can see.  I think they'd love it.
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:02:39
where do you apply for one of these shill jobs?  I'd be great at it!
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:22:25
How could I have not prepared for the rib dip!  I never learn.  
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:18:59
cha ching!  and here i thought i was doing well because i have 2 robinhood referrals.  stepping up to the big leagues now!
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:44:33
Yeah I've been on that plan for some time now, definitely a great way to proceed!  
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:43:10
Keep at it!  But once you get one, you just want to get to 2...
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:23:07
I've been exposed!
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:02:01
No, I fear it's not.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:45:43
Difficulty adjusts. If it drops low enough I get to start mining myself!
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:06:03
Spend it all on Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-19 22:23:18
Makes for a fun background!
@_date: 2019-08-26 03:44:19
I put in an order right around that time.  Thank you for your satoshis sir!
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:22:45
True that, this one really surprised me in terms of how many people it has shaken out.  I just really wish I had more capital available, this would be such a great time to pick up a whole coin but I wasn't ready for that big of a purchase.  Ah well, I grabbed a few hundred bucks worth and will be doing about 300-400 bucks more after I see how we do around the 6k mark.
@_date: 2019-08-26 14:11:10
I never snared any at 3k.  3.4 was as good as I ever did.  Good job!
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:43:22
ayyy sell to me direct.  i'll make things out of toothpicks for you or somethin
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:24:32
Fiat styled money isn't leaving, period.  We might transition back to a gold backed currency, which would be incredibly disruptive - but the current system isn't going away for a sudden leap to cryptos.  Having said that, there is DEFINITELY room for crypto to eat into that market share (for my sake I certainly hope that's the case).
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:15:03
I've been trying to get an idea of what my ideal ratio is between the two and I keep changing my mind.  BTC/Gold/Silver/Stonks .... I am not totally sure what the best percentages would be for me.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:40:43
I've been accumulating as much as I can for way too long.  Bitcoin and Gold/Silver have been taking a shit for so long that I have no more money to put into my favorite things!
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:04:07
First of the month is around the corner, don't forget to thank mom for the rent money!
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:18:41
Lol, fair
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:09:29
Ah to be at zero....it's a beautiful thought
@_date: 2018-06-13 04:01:29
I bought 6% of 1 today, is that enough??
@_date: 2018-06-25 23:59:10
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:05:57
We'll see.  I'm cautiously optimistic. 
@_date: 2019-08-26 03:45:02
I've never sold bitcoin.  When the day comes I'm going to feel very mixed about it.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:06:20
You will next month when we go up all the way to 7200
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:24:26
Solve X. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 15:40:04
I think it's resolved now. It's time traveling quantum AI, obviously. 
@_date: 2019-10-19 19:57:30
Look at a chart.  If you bought gold 2 years ago you'd be up quite a bit over your $100.  Gold is awesome (bitcoin is too).
@_date: 2019-10-20 02:11:06
Very well said.  I feel the exact same way.
@_date: 2018-06-22 02:05:42
Could be. I heard a conspiracy that he was actually making about 100k per tweet, and the dick offer isn't a true offer but instead a clever marketing trick. Obviously this isn't the case, tho. Obviously. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:42:10
Interesting. Thanks for the reply!
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:56:19
Dollars.  It was a joke.
@_date: 2019-02-22 18:58:30
Appreciate the reply, haven't deep dived on a couple of these - will do so today.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:20:19
I thought that too, but I'm getting texts from friends who don't follow this day-by-day like I do and they're selling today.  That's never happened before.  Kinda surprised me.
@_date: 2019-02-25 05:15:59
That's the spirit!
@_date: 2019-02-28 23:05:02
Well selling $10k key services was supposed to sustain them, yeah?  Gooood luck.
This feels more realistic.
@_date: 2019-02-22 18:30:05
Can you name your favorite 5 alts, and the purpose you envision they serve?  (not a trap/troll, curious as to which you see carving out a role)
@_date: 2019-02-22 18:38:01
No, you can't make your own copy and fulfill the same role.  You can copy the code, many do.  You might get rich off of it, many have.  But it won't have the hash power, it won't have the innovators, and it won't have the strength.  The only thing you can do is clone a shitcoin and attempt to rob people of their money in the short term (as many have done).
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:11:29
What's your goal?  Whatever it is, you have enough ... you just might have to wait longer than somebody who has more bitcoin.  It feels weirder buying in the high levels, but do it.  And keep doing it.  Buy it consistently and HODL.  On a long enough timeline you're guaranteed to win.
@_date: 2019-02-20 20:36:25
I'd say short term you're fine, but start saving up for a Ledger or Trezor so moving forward you purchase and move it all on to your own device.  If you are wanting to actively use your coins on a daily basis move your coins over to something like Samurai wallet right away.
@_date: 2019-10-22 22:58:17
I like an 85/15 split
@_date: 2019-02-21 02:42:11
My understanding is they are striving to hit full capacity in a channel and then whoever has it last is to donate it to BTC Venezuela
@_date: 2019-02-28 21:07:54
Okay, I hear what you're saying..but when moon?
@_date: 2019-02-21 15:39:56
There were certainly better times.  In December 2025 one may still be happy with getting involved (and would have learned a great deal over the experience).
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:10:17
Exactly.  Quark would LOVE bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-02-20 21:01:20
One step ahead of you.  Now I want more on a lightning wallet for usage!
@_date: 2019-02-21 17:56:42
I love a juicy prediction, mind sharing what you foresee? 
@_date: 2019-02-20 20:52:41
The torch is nearing its end!  What a great early use of Lightning.
@_date: 2019-02-20 20:20:39
I hope he does.  I've been dabbling with nodes and lightning for a while, but this got me to sign up for tippin and I've officially had a real Lightning transaction.  I can't even refresh my browser without it being completed.  So game changing it's unreal!
@_date: 2019-02-22 18:40:03
I LOVE YOU
@_date: 2019-02-22 18:43:45


That's somehow worse, actually.
@_date: 2019-02-22 18:30:45
I need to get some reddit satoshi's so I can tip myself in this way, i love it lol
@_date: 2019-02-21 15:41:16
I've had so much fun tipping satoshi's on twitter now that I know how.  I am hesitant to spend my bitcoin, and yet the light tipping is incredibly fun.
@_date: 2019-02-20 20:49:03
This is very promising, can't wait to learn more
@_date: 2019-02-21 20:35:04
Don't just stop using coinbase, fully delete your account.
@_date: 2019-02-20 20:35:14
I've picked up that soap so many times it doesn't even hurt any more!
@_date: 2019-02-21 17:59:36

Not even close yet.  When the masses keep saying we're at capitulation, we are not at capitulation.  I've seen plenty here and on twitter "rage quitting" crypto, but nobody of import that I've found ... and several of them have short term accounts.  I'm going to keep my DCA going, but I think we still have a stretch before capitulation.

Cool, appreciate the feedback!  I've had the casa node and out of my cart all week and just don't know if I want to spend the cash.  I mean, if it's useful to put $100 USD to sit on the node I'd be down but I've been wondering if there's even a point to it (other than learning a bunch..which is nice, but not I dunno). Anywho, appreciate the knowledge!
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:49:35
Is that really what this is?  If that's the case the pain could be quite long standing, no?
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:57:20
Do you have to store your own BTC on the node, or is simply routing other payments okay?

@_date: 2018-11-20 19:39:22
So when you set that up do you need to move your own BTC onto lightning to run the node?  I'm beginning to research lightning a bit more and see these pop up (with great reviews).

Yeah i'm thrilled in that I didn't buy in that range, but I can't say I'm doing well.  I really misjudged the numbers Sunday.  Ah well.  Sit back and watch the show.  It really is much better if I get out of this sub and just live my life, but for some reason I force myself to watch the train wreck.

If I'm seeing this correctly, running a Windows device one only needs to keep the GUI running to be operating a full node?  Is that right?  If so I'll definitely skip over to a windows build on whatever I do because that's pretty darn sweet.

Let's see how you feel when we hit 4k.
@_date: 2019-01-08 18:24:57
I'm so on the fence.  I really don't want to drop $300 on a casa node, but I also want a GUI interface on a node I plan to use for some time.  Good luck with this build, please post a follow up on how you like it in a month or two!
@_date: 2019-01-25 16:55:02
Ha, true that!  How long did your pi take to download the bitcoind?  The guide said to run it overnight and it'll be done in a few hours but mine took much longer.  That was my only hiccup.
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:10:52
$250 cheaper?  Please send me a parts list, as I'd respectfully like to call bullshit on your claim.
@_date: 2019-01-23 23:14:00
excellent! I'm building one this week.  Are you interfacing it with a mobile or desktop wallet, or just doing everything off of the pi directly?
@_date: 2018-11-23 04:59:35
Where's the best place to start learning about Lightning? I have all the parts to build the Raspberry Pi lightning node, but still need to learn about it (and kinda don't want to park my own BTC there without knowing more about the safety and whatnot).
@_date: 2019-01-09 03:28:59
Did you find any good deals on external hard drives?  Went to build a node tonight and have all the parts...but my old external was puttered out.  Most are around $50 it seems, but would love to save a few bucks and get this done cheaper...
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:45:32

@_date: 2019-01-09 16:25:22
There we go, now the numbers look correct.  I posted that as somebody trying to get the parts to build my own node but haven't found a hard drive cheaper than around $50. :)

Well, it takes more TIME than anticipated (in my experience).  It's pretty easy because the guide is so helpful, but if you think "I'm setting aside a night or two to get this done" then you'll be a bit surprised.
@_date: 2019-01-08 18:56:11
Interesting!  I'll keep the trick in mind. :)

What qualifies as a "larger amount" these days?  
@_date: 2019-01-07 02:45:17
Yep - but I think more important would be to make sure you're buying from Ledger directly.
@_date: 2018-11-13 02:37:05
I'm already paying for unlimited internet, so figured that's another perk to getting set up! :)
Right now I've found a cool Raspiblitz project too, but not sure if it's actually worth pushing to a raspberry pi.  If it is actually worthwhile I have all the parts except an extra screen and a hard drive though, so that'd be super rad.
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:40:49
Not if you're in a hurry.
@_date: 2019-01-30 18:57:19
That's what I'm wondering too.  If I invest in 1 BTC through Fidelity, is it literally 1 BTC that is held and tied up until retirement time - or is it a fractional "investment" type of deal.  Big difference between the two.
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:55:49
Not sure what type of help you can receive, but I'd check with whoever sent you the BTC.  If this was done properly you'd have several confirmations by now.
@_date: 2019-01-29 23:15:50
Boy what I wouldn't do to hold as many coins as you.  
@_date: 2019-01-04 22:06:22
Very logical, and I see it the same way.  I think Lightning is a huge step in that direction, but I don't think it'll get the job done alone.  Great things are happening, and I think the 1 in 10 number is quite feasible (eventually).
@_date: 2019-01-04 22:07:08
I'm not planning on it happening in 5 years, no.  But hey, how neat would that be!
@_date: 2018-11-29 19:01:23
Ah, interesting!  I've been spending the last week or so trying to figure it out and am really excited about it.  If a person set up a casa node to try to learn this stuff how much BTC would you think a person needs to keep on the node to be used (generally speaking)?
@_date: 2018-11-12 23:35:17
That does look neat!  I kinda dig the idea of putting everything together.  I didn't really understand mining until I built a little rig, so was kinda looking to get into the same with a node.  Will poke around on this one a bit more tho and check it out.
@_date: 2019-01-04 19:21:00
No chance.  Not at 20k.
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:12:42
Oh, Kevin.  Good luck bud.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:10:46
Bummer dude.  I've made plenty today and had no issue.  Did a little one after reading your message and was fine.
@_date: 2018-11-29 05:00:56
This is so perfect, thank you!
@_date: 2018-11-13 13:24:41
Well, it was a pleasure while it lasted.  Thanks again!
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:53:51
Oh totally.  I know I'd never recoop the money in the node itself, but that's fine.  I just didn't know if me holding a couple BTC on a channel HELPS people.  It's sounding like it does, so I think I am going to give it a go!  I already run a full node on the PC, but moving it over to run on a dedicated device with lightning sounds super nifty.
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:28:59
How do you take your Lightning satoshi's off lightning network and send back to a regular segwit address?
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:03:22

Will have to look at Bitstamp, thanks for the heads up.  Many others I've not seen so I will do more research.  I tried to use Kraken but after submitting several documents, photo ID, etc. they kicked it back and asked for me to rotate images.  So I did, and they kicked it back asking for a bunch of documents.  I then closed my Kraken account.
@_date: 2018-04-11 19:12:20

@_date: 2018-04-06 22:29:16
No problem on the hodl front.  Accumulation is a struggle, but a bit better each week/month.  I really wish I knew of a side gig I could fit into my life that I could either be paid in BTC or just put 100% of the side gig into BTC holdings.  Would like to open something up, but am already working around 80+ hours a week.

Doesn't matter what happens with crypto, he's bankrolled in marketing right now.  And the more we talk about the wager and keep that in our minds the more money we allow him to generate off the foolishness.  More power to him, I think it is incredibly clever.

@_date: 2018-04-17 14:26:22
I agree.  But until change is met one must pay their taxes (or face consequences).  I'm unwilling to face the consequences of not paying my taxes, so I will pay them in full and I won't even think of doing otherwise.  I don't judge those that do differently, but I do dismiss those that criticize my approach as unethical.  
How to go about changing tax structure, how taxes are utilized, et cetera....well that's an entirely different conversation, and I suspect we'd have a lot of agreements in *that* conversation.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:54:52

Hey that's exactly where I bought BTC!  Wanna trade holdings?
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:03:39
Yeah I definitely want to check it out.  If anybody knows of any basic tutorial vids I'd love to check it out.  It's on my to-do list for Saturday.
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:45:44
Interesting, I'll take a look at that! Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:21:43
months?  No way, really?  I'm with you that it's coming but I really don't feel it being so close.
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:56:39
I haven't received a PM, but I hope it's got a picture of a sphynx kitten!

I hear ya.  I do have a small amount of stocks--but I have a dream of someday having one full bitcoin and the longer I wait to make that happen the harder it is going to be.  
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:32:45
Not remotely.  Love my nation (and my crypto).
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:40:09
Anybody have a quick note on if/how much it pays?
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:36:57
I'm right there with you.  In fact I only just finally bit the bullet and got in on Litecoin this week.  I did it for two poor reasons.  One, if they hit it with their push for payment platforms they could be considered for a quick on ramp into crypto and therefore rise.  Secondly, my only IRL friend into crypto bought a fair amount of LTC and that's all he owns (God only knows why).  If it takes off and I miss on projects I love I wouldn't be able to live after hearing him go on and on about it.  It's like an insurance "investment".
The other projects I legitimately love.  Bitcoin is my main holding, though I don't have nearly enough and am afraid I won't hit my goal before the next rise.  Monero is my favorite privacy coin, which I see having real legs in the future, Stellar is my favorite industry coin for a number of reasons, and Digibyte is great because you can actually use the damn thing now.
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:04:59
I hope they do.  Paying taxes is just a part of the game, on all levels.  
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:19:58
I don't know how I could possibly fit trucking in on the side, that'd be a full time proposition in its own right.  Thanks for the brainstorming though!
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:13:26
Yes!  A really fun read for anybody that doesn't know about this.
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:06:36
Litecoin UltraCash (Classic) is Satoshi Lite's true vision.
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:04:49
Wow.  TIL.
@_date: 2018-04-02 20:13:40
Would love to, but then who the heck do I buy BTC from?
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:20:16
I'd happily buy more here, if only I had money!
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:41:03
Don't forget about me down here!  I'm buying as much as I can, but on low wages I'm not making much traction.  Still doing as best I can to get in the game!
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:28:48
Agreed.  I wish I could look into the crystal ball to see just how much one would need to put in to BTC today to have a million bucks in 5 years.   Silly, I know.
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:52:03
Kinda neat to see you here, and thanks for reaching out!  I might give it a try in the future, but the whole thing seems like a huge pain in the rear right now (with not enough clear reason why it's worth the hassle).  On your note of "I do not think that should be an issue," I totally agree with you.  Really had me flummoxed.  I emailed support too and a day later got some template garbage.  Aint nobody got time for that.
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:34:08
As far as I can tell this is the first time you've asserted a point.  This conversation started by you asking questions, which were answered at face value.  How was I to know you intended to hide a point within your open question?  
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:16:43


@_date: 2018-04-12 14:37:56
Better hope that's not the single reason behind this bump, because if so it'll drop just as fast very soon.
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:44:36
Is this insider information?  Surely I would have seen this posted if true!
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:48:57
I'm in the same boat.  It's hard right now because silver prices are pretty good, but I just can't bring myself to not put new funds into crypto at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:50:52
Helluva good point.  Admittedly, I'm too heavy into crypto from a percentage standpoint (and it's not close).  If I can somehow reach a full bitcoin my plan is to start balancing out with stocks.  That's the plan anyways.  Thanks for the chat, gave me some great food for thought today.
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:07:15
Based on what is being presented I've successfully determined you do not work in the financial industry.  
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:39:09
2012!  Oh man, how I envy your vision.  To be in the game in 2012 is one thing.  To hold through it?  Bravo, bravo!  I'm working 2 jobs and won't be able to sniff the amount of BTC you could come by back then! :)
@_date: 2018-07-25 17:44:13
My goal is to hold it until my mortgage lender accepts it.  If/when I can pay off my house directly with BTC I'll know it's time to get rid of *that amount* of BTC.

^^...oh ^^wait
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:14:13
Ha, I don't play in that sand box.  I buy when I can, try to time it right.  Short term I'm wrong most of the time.  If I buy today, we're destined to have a 3 day down turn.  My hodl game is strong, though.

I actually downloaded Bisq this past weekend because I read it can exchange a couple smaller cryptos I own.  When I pulled it up I had no idea where to send my crypto, and no idea where to view the exchange options.  I need to pry into it further, but I'll be darned if it was easy and straight forward to me.

I can't wait to be a noob!

Doesn't add up.  We'll go D. Trump again in 2020, then 2024 goes to I. Trump.  Why re-elect Ivanka virtually in 2028?  Silly logic.

Tell that to Russia and China.  They've been buying heavy for a few years now.  I'm in the camp that wishes their country was doing the same.
@_date: 2018-04-11 20:53:59
They'll be back this summer
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:35:14
Possible, maybe....but how much BTC would one need to be holding to do that?  I'm always striving for more, and my target always feels impossibly far away.
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:09:54
Should such an eruption occur, where are you placing your assets? 
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:36:34
This is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:24:02
I fully agree.  What are some of your favorite "quality projects"?
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:24:26
Okay, I like that trivia.  How do we go about getting a satoshi up to a penny?  Because that'd really help me out.

Doesn't Trezor only give you 12 words though?

The guy making these is doing some really, really neat stuff.  I wish the files were a touch bigger to use on a digital posterboard, because they're really great.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:29:22
This is the metric that has had me the most excited this past week.  Sanity flocking back into the market (for now).
@_date: 2018-12-25 00:32:53
I'd lose my shit if it was a penny, and you're shooting for a buck!?
