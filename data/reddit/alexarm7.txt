I am very saddened by this crash because I know so many teenagers who invested into crypto with their college funds during december/january rush and now they have nothing left.
My advice to you, please get out of crypto if you have families and children to feed. this is the game of whales and greediness and they will steal all your money and unless you are a very early investor, they will send you onto the streets. Cryptocurrency can be compared to religion. religion for centuries was used to control population and enslave them. Cryptocurrency is used by few hundred people who own half of btc that manipulate the market in a way where regular people have a delusional hope that one day they will get rich so you put money into crypto using loans, credit cards, mortgaging houses. Banks overseen it and now they try to ban it. Dont excluse the odds of that whales know each other are high and together they can easily nullify  the market to take all your money leaving you broke. Once the market becomes worthless the cycle repeats. people please get out now the market CAN crash to 3k or below and it is inevitable because it is not decided by the world, its decided by few people.  I was a victim of bitcoin scam too. i invested 10k into trx  when it was 24 cents and 2k into ela at 90$ and icx 35k satoshi and now I am broke. I just have 1500$ left from 12k and I will aknowledge my losses and get into real regulated market. there are much better markets out there where you are fully protected. my wife invested into shopify last year her stocks went from 35$ to 190$ and it will only grow. no market manipulation whatsoever. stop feeding the whales please. blockchain is the future, I agree. however i believe when institutions step in, it will be regulated but they will use  their own network rather than the corrupted btc and this is why btc can one day just disappear.

Thank you for taking your valuable time to give your descriptive analysis. I really appreciate that :)

what about going from trade to trade between alt coin and bitcoin? for example today trx went from 440 to 680. unfortunately i sold too early at 540 thinking it wont go any higher. now I am waiting for trx to go back to 440 to accumulate more.

I mean to be able to withdraw 10 000$ i lost in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:18:26
what do you mean by use? also do you suggest swing trading in crypto?
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:42:00
Dear sir, can you tell me how come people pay big money for TA signals if swing trading can hurt your wallet? 
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:53:00
how would you know which month to avoid? 
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:41:47
I truly believe once I sell, the market will sstart to recover
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:12:50
I am a serious investor. I am not here as a "joke". I made a risky investment, you dont know how it feels to lose all your savings in a matter of 2 months because you probably got into the game a year ago so you have absolutely no clue about financial losses. and no, reduction in profits doesnt count.

You are very rude especially because you were completely off describing me. I don't put anyone down. I always try to help people on telegram any way I can. I can troll here and there but I truly believe in good intentions rewarding you some day.

Dear sir, can you tell me how come people pay big money for TA signals if swing trading can hurt your wallet if you are unavailable? There are groups that charge 100-500 dollars a month and they have a lot of subscribers. I know once you have 50k members pump and dump will take place. But prior to that, What do they do to be able to build from 0 such strong following? People must have had confidence in them for a reason

thank you. actually I took myself out of verge and trx and reinvested in zilliqa at 450 satoshi. I hope you are right

Not even close.. I'm probably 50% down
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:31:54
I have another job. I am a seasonal bar owner. I plan to put 10% of my income into crypto. I am in canada so our summer season starts around may 24 long weekend so I was feeling a little impatient and try to get ahead of myself and take out large loan since crypto is down so low because everyone is saying that by end of may crypto will recover and I dont want to invest at the peak of another bull run.
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:51:58
can you explain why. arent some cryptocurrency made as an upgrade to a bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:45:41
Thank you very much. I will take that advice. I do believe the market has extremely low odds to get any lower because mining is now becoming unprofittable and if I sell now I will regret it for the rest of my life.

WUSA WUSA WUSA!!! MY WIFE ALWAYS LAUGHED AT ME INVESTING INTO BTC, BUT THEN I SHOWED HER MY WALLET. AND SHE WAS LIKE WAHHHHH?? AND IM LIKE YAH YAH YAH!! BITCOINEEEEEEEEEEEEECT!
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:46:56
do you think cryptocurrency one day will recover though? I saw so many endless article prognosing bitcoin to reach 25k by end of the year but it is for certainty. I want a certainty. I want assurance that lending my money into crypto will yield me high gains. It sure worked for early investors who borrowed companies thousands and made millions. How is it fair that I trust and feed an ico and in return they just use my money with no return. Even banks give annual return of 2% sometimes!
