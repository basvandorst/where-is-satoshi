Trying to reset my password to log into gox, but their password reset module is broken returning an error page. Hopefully they'll have some time to answer support issues even though they're spending all their time on implementing this "fix."

I think mainly because it was a mycelium backup; you needed that app specifically to restore the funds

Correct me if I'm wrong, but if they had used Bitcoin, they likely would have already sent the the money and would have likely been scammed.

I just have a short bash script to run it and prompt me to enter my mint password, so it's not stored in my bash history.

Glyde allows you to actually sell the phone though and cut out a lot of the middleman fees; I would get about $270 in pocket from my HTC One on Glyde whereas I would get $190 on Mintspare.
