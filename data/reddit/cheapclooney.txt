Is Bitcoin QT still a secure/acceptable offline wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:21:50
Thanks! Sorry in advance, I've been out of the game a while as you can tell and am trying to get caught up.


I backed up the wallet.dat file a couple months ago, I don't need to sync the wallet for that right? I simply have the wallet.dat file saved on a separate device.


Do you have a link to where I can download this? Then it would be as simple as importing the dat file and my balance would be transferred to my new fully synced offline wallet?


I did consider that. Once I have the private key(and public key) I could also just use physical storage too correct?

lol at people thinking it will be at 100k when it has no current utility

Thanks again for the response.
The wallet is probably going to take a few weeks to sync unfortunately. 
I'm still not seeing how to get my private key from my wallet. But I'll do some googling.
I guess this is what I get for not opening my wallet for over a year!

Thank you. That does help!
A few follow ups
1.) Is bitoin core the newer version if bitcoin qt? I see it tells me to upgrade when I open my bitcoin qt wallet, but I don't see an updated version of bitcoin qt?
2.) My wallet is going to take forever to sync. Is there a way around this?
3.) How would I import my private key? I don't know where/how to find it?

What do you mean by forked coins and what does that mean I'll need to do differently?

Would likely take months of leaving my computer on at this point. Do I need to let it sync to transfer to a different wallet?

Christ, is everything really a conspiracy with you guys? He's Satoshi. A lot of evidence points to it and people with more knowledge than you confirmed it. Just relax, the world isn't out to get you.

I know my address, but not my private key. Thank you for the link, that is helpful for the paper wallet portion.
Would the DAT file I saved to a USB include my private key?
So if my laptop gets run over by a bus tomorrow, how do I take that dat file and find what I need to have access to my btc?
