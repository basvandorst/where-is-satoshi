If you actually do your homework thoroughly on each one, and find reasons why you believe it's a good thing to buy, then I say there's nothing wrong with buying coins that are not Bitcoin.
But...how many investors in the "coin space" do you think actually do that?  My guess is less than 2%.
Personally, I don't have time to do thorough homework on even a small subset of the thousands of coins, tokens, etc that I could buy.  I already found Bitcoin, did my homework, and found my reasons to believe.

Should they be so inclined (to fund a war or something), your government can seize any and all of your wealth that you store in banks, brokerages, etc.  Those places are centralized, and make easy targets.

It's all of the things.  Network speed (to download the blocks), CPU speed (to verify them), and storage speed (to read blocks that are not in memory for verification).
Initial synchronization will take longer with slower storage, and the penalty increases as the database size grows (less fits into memory so disk access is more likely), but it's not that terrible.
I expect in a bad case that slow storage (like a 4000 rpm laptop drive) could make initial synchronization take a week instead of a day.

Many altcoins have tried messing with the difficulty adjustment algorithm.  Sometimes this leads to unintended results.
Back in the day there was this one called Terracoin, whose difficulty was determined by a rolling average of the times between the last 300 blocks, or something like that.
I had a script that would query my TRC node every few seconds asking for the currently difficulty.  If it was below a certain threshold, it would have my miners stop mining BTC and switch over to TRC while the difficulty was low.  They would mine a series low difficulty blocks in a big hurry (a few minutes), and then when the difficulty got high again (because of all the blocks mined in such a short period), the script would flop my miners back over to BTC, and let the TRC chain stagnate until the whole process could be repeated.

The real win when it comes to EVs is how they decouple the point of generation from the point of consumption.
Suppose the burning of petroleum becomes unviable for some reason.  With an EV, all you have to do to switch to a new generation technology is change out the powerplants that feed the grid.  The vehicle can remain unchanged.
If instead you've got a vehicle equipped with an ICE, well, you've pretty much gotta replace the vehicle.

According to [this site]( pure gold has a specific gravity of 19.32, where tungsten is 19.22.  That's a difference of 0.5176%.  I don't think I would notice such a difference easily at all.
A counterfeiter wouldn't need to use pure tungsten either.  They could add a bit of a heavier material (like platinum) to make up the difference.

Forwarding to multiple IPs is not possible.  You need to choose only one.  If you had multiple entries, the router was probably using the first one.

Actually you can.  The exchange will try to liquidate the position before this happens, but when the market moves fast they might not be able to.
That’s why a traditional brokerage requires a margin account with a credit agreement before they will let you take a short position.

I don’t know the precise steps, but you basically need to create a new wallet using a wallet app, import your private keys into that wallet, and then spend from it (send to a new address that you control), and set a fee higher than that used on the transaction you are competing with.

I have done it before, replacing my own transaction with a superseding one, without having explicitly enabled RBF.
It did take a while, and the original transaction was days old, so maybe that was a factor.
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:04:35
IF you can obtain the private keys for the source addresses, you can create and sign a competing transaction that spends from the same UTXOs, but sends the coins
to an address you control, include a higher fee, broadcast it and hope someone mines it, thereby invalidating the “hack” transaction.
This only has a chance of working for as long as the “hack” transaction remains unconfirmed.
However, with the funds being stored in some dodgy web wallet I don’t know if you can obtain the private keys or not.
When it comes to your keys, trust no one.
