Sounds like the post hoc rationalization and attempt at justification of an abusive status quo.
As a collection of metabolic pathways which can be described in some sense by the laws of thermodynamics, there is no magic that can save us from "working" until we die. And even then, assuming the corpse isn't molested, the gut bacteria will have a lovely field day and continue to work long after the conscious bits of us have stopped "working."

Right, but there is nothing special or exceptional about US politics.  It's a linguistically adroit ape kakistocracy.  
I'm not interested in teasing symptoms.  What is with Humans and their desperate denial of the core problem...
As for the rest of it, the usual response:  argue the arguer, avoid the argument at all costs.  
Me, my feelings, beliefs, "personhood" - species - all irrelevant to the argument.  And yet all I get is a keen interest in "me."    How do you suppose that happened?

Money is a chimp story.  
And just as I said... it goes back to the basic argumentum ad baculum, and the naturalistic fallacy.
What is actually working here?   Working to do what?


Right... maybe.  But is this how it works out for the vast majority of life?  I'm not sure how anyone can honestly say "yes."  


For a tiny few, and only for those life forms capable of being deceived by the money story.
Mindless self-replicating molecule has the entire population of so-called 'alpha apex land predator Humans' dancing to its pointless tune.  And the net result is a glut of agony, suffering, and the perpetuation of delusional dying biomass with a delusional optimism \_sampling bias\_
For what?  
Most sentient biology does this sort of thing.  99% of all known species have gone extinct.  And none of them on their own terms.    
They all danced to the same tune, and they're all gone.  Is that a smart strategy?    Short term, for a few, fuck yeah.  Long term?  All the eggs end up in a few small baskets.  
I'm not convinced by economic circularity.  I'm starting to become convinced Humans are not worth saving.

Extinction is inevitable.  What percentage of known species have gone extinct?  Go look it up if you don't believe me.  So it is not just "realistic" - it's going to happen.  I don't care about your species, either.  I care about your conscious experience and its quality, stripped of its delusions.
Again, for now the third time, the "immigrants suck" rebuttal is irrelevant.  Nowhere did I say "USA Only."  
  
So it's clear that if you read anything I wrote, you paid it no attention or cherry-picked enough to straw man it and draw the usual non-sequitur

What I don't understand is what an "alternate timeline" is in this context - and how a time-traveller remains a coherent subjective "experiencer" - especially a biological one; while "travelling to it."  There are some information processing problems with this idea that render it unintelligible to me.

Nowhere in what I have said is the abdication of the utility of a personal responsibility function in a society.

"The contrary is belief that humans do not have control over their own actions"
Seems a false dichotomy. Either total control or none at all?
Humans do have a rational veto process that is itself contingent upon antecedents. No part of us is singularly in control of anything. Everything we do is in response to some stimulus. Sometimes that stimulus is a symbolic experience - a diaphanous reification of the real world. And sometimes our rational process is a failure - but this happens as an effect of biochemistry. No part of us shapes that independent of the underlying physics.
Perhaps this helps: Want what you want before you want it if you can. Does wishing ever makes it so?
A justice system built on valid and inductively strong discourse is what would happen if people became rational about the logically possible nature of consciousness and about decision making.
But this is a form of burden-of-proof shifting. Surely you'd need to demonstrate a coherent, contra-causal yet necessarily causally active (somehow) "free will" - which is exactly what most of the retribution systems are built on - without arbitrarily ignoring the rest of any significant bits of the causal chain. 
Punishing someone with retribution for being confused about the nature of reality is not going to help them not be confused. It results in nothing more than an argumentum ad baculum writ large. The threat of punishment may deter some (and the threat is causal, their desire to not suffer, a desire which they do not cause, is also causal). Helping them understand reality to the best of our ability surely gives us rational actors, no?
If I am causal in and of myself in any way... I am more than a God.

Nope.  You have no idea what you're dealing with here, do you?
I criticized his behavior and incoherent ideas.  That is a difference.  Personhood is an illusion.
So read what I actually wrote.   Not into it with your incoherent ape delusions.


Does a mechanic not "continue society" regardless of whether or not it has children?
It presupposes society should continue, and along the non-cognitive path of slaughter it has continued down for so long.  It's not just incoherent, it's stupid.   AT the core of the claim is that an aversion state is not an aversion state.
And it is in direct contradiction with his worship of Ann Coulter's racism, via the next quote.
If you can't put this together, you're blind, and this is because your head is up Molyneaux (and Peterson's) ass.
The media you consume has destroyed your ability to think critically.  About anything on the subject.


It is the reification of "the market" as a sentient entity, and applied as rationalization for the perpetuation of suffering, pain and death via either theodicy or anthropodicy.   "God" = "nature" = "market" - and Ayn Rand's nebulous "greater good" - there you go.  Anything you do is somehow magically justified, including caging kids at a border, raping them in churches - and forcing them to happen (and suffer and die as a result) because getting your rocks off feels good.
Yet your "greater good" *never materializes - you have to lie by omission, optimism bias, count those hits and ignore the misses* 


You're beyond done, nothing of any substance will come from you on this subject - your god has been exposed for the lie that is and still you worship.
Like a dog back to its vomit.
And no, I'm no leftist.  They run in terror from me, just like the right-wing - desperate to hide from the horror of their own fragile existence, pulled inexorably toward their own death with every breath.  You worshippers of natural so-called "selection" are an abomination.  And yet you keep bringing "me" back.  Why do you do it?  You won't learn.
Until you learn, it's just going to keep getting worse - and here by your own hand.


No...  he has solved nothing but the limitations of his own bank accounts.  By exploiting Human proclivity for reproductive fitness signalling over sound reasoning.   


So how does that work?
How exactly does one "choose to understand?"
If I tell you there's a colorless green cubic sphere on the table, can you arbitrarily "choose to understand" what I have said?
When you think you're "choosing to believe and understand" things you're starting with a "conclusion"  - the usual affirming-the-consequent fallacy is invoked.   
You're either convinced a conclusion is sound, or you're not.  Adding choice to this equation *is how we lie.*


Indeed, in this case.  I've been as wrong as them.  I believed the same bullshit.  
But  I wasn't stupid enough to force the spread of suffering, pain and death via natural reproduction.  So yeah... *you are the problem.  All of you who continue this process.* 
In the only way that fundamentally matters, *I am them, I am you, and you are me:  consciousness*.  
You are consciousness falsely identifying as its contents.   You spew reproductive fitness signalling (feelings) as if it were a sound rationalization for the perpetuation of the process.
It's dumber than trying to solve a Rubik's cube by spinning one face of it one direction.  As long as possible.  And insisting it will solve the cube.  Because that's the way it's always been.

This is not what I wrote.
Nociceptive pathways regulated by pain and suffering states are the ontology of "bad."  There's no capacity for "bad" to happen absent those pathways.  This is not confined to "people."


This is also not anything I wrote.   The specific language I used was: "...shutting down that ability in any other system."   Not limited to "payment processors."
Refusing to continue facilitating pain, suffering and death is not the same thing as "payment processors to prevent."
Paypal's measures are pathetic and half-assed, corporate self-preservation.

Well this is why you are confused, your assumption is incoherent.
If I am completely alone and I know that I am averse to pain, and repeatedly slam my own face into a wall as if this will solve my aversion state, this is entirely "my fault."  I am under no duress in this situation, and the fault is the delusional expectation that behavior which continues to produce aversion states will somehow not produce aversion states.

As I said, you are too far up your gods' asses to comprehend anything I've written.  The straw manning is impossible to navigate.  This is not an honest argument, and you're beyond done.
The mountain of incoherence in your desperate denial of the reality of your situation makes conversation impossible.  All you do is spew reproductive fitness symbols.  There is no rational process in your language.


She will die as a result of his actions.
There is chronic pain, there is death.  There is no such thing as "chronic pleasure, happiness" - and there is no immortality.   The asymmetry is ontological.  No excuses.
That someone can "be happy" after being raped does not mean rape is morally intelligent, and does not obviate the harm it produces.
Another example of your dishonesty:


Wasn't a quote of anything you had written, as I had clearly already destroyed your delusional assertion that people magically "choose to understand."  The point is clearly that people use *rhetorical lies*  with the concept of  "belief" as well as that of understanding.

This is the problem with economics and market worship.
It's all based on the fallacy of relative privation.  The goal-posts for what it means for the economy to be "doing well" can be moved infinitely.   "Well' in this context is a *humptydumptyism*  just like presuppositional apologetics' use of the term "god."  
This is not to say that your comment has no use or value, nor to attack your personhood.  Quite the contrary - because I think the other things you had to say (BTC could "pop to zero")  are sound, and worth paying attention to and keeping in mind.

He's quite prolific. I first encountered his material in 2012.  In some cases he was close to sane then.
It's been downhill for him most of the time since, into complete incoherence.
One thing I learned from Molyneaux and the likes, which he does his best to hide, is that reproductive fitness signalling is not language.  It is phonation - ape noises which produce non-cognitive responses in similarly stupid life forms.  No different than the low information mating noises made by birds and other sentient, but not sapient life.

Good grief it is not alive, it doesn't have the capacity to "morality police."
It's a useful tool.  Metaphor this and that, I know - the problem is you (world) use stories as a vehicle for motte &amp; bailey lies.  
It's reasonable to worry about "who watches the watchers" - given priors, and given the Human proclivity for what amounts to sophisticated chimp behavior.  Too often in this space this is, however, used as an equivocation for "I want to get away with some abuse or other."     
Just because BTC can be used for crime and abuse doesn't mean anyone should celebrate that, nor shun anyone else for shutting down that ability in any other system - to the degree that they can do so.
Some information is objectively bad for anything sufficiently sentient and sapient which  processes it.  We can figure out what that is real damn quick - given our frailty relative to environmental stressors.

Depressive realism obtains and you are attempting to abuse someone who you think might have depression (this is how confused you are).
This is normal Human behavior, to traumatize and abuse outlier traits in an attempt to "correct" them.  That is ableism.  There is no way to equivocate your way out of it.

Assuming you're *not*  trolling - the map ain't the territory.
One of the problems with the way we idealize and worship "markets" is that they have no utility function beyond the perpetuation of the market itself.  "Capitalism has no goal" - it is a status quo apologetic.  Before any of you fools jump to the asinine non-sequitur "oh but SoCiaLisM!!!"  - the two are the same damn thing, they just shift the "ownership of the means of production."  Neither solves the fundamental problem markets are - ostensibly - an invention we're told they will solve.  Funny how the never solve it, but instead are instrumental in perpetuating it.
BTC *could*  be a pathway to fixing this problem.  I am skeptical that it will be used this way.
If a market were ever only about "means of exchange"  this would be different.  But in practice, it never is, it's about the usual Human might-makes-right fallacies, and pointless reproductive fitness noises.

Antinatalism is like atheism.  It's a single response to a single issue.  Promortalism does not necessarily follow from this.
Antinatalism is simply the recognition that birth - as it happens naturally - is a negative value.  
If you're going to argue with what someone actually believes, research it properly.  Or don't make unnecessary assumptions, and ask.


I doubt it.   I think you are engaging in ape fitness signalling.  If you could murder me and get away with it, you'd probably try.  If you could leverage social pressure to get others to do it for you, you'd probably try.
I may not be *reproductively fit* (why would I want to be?)  - but I am fit in other ways.  I see what most Humans cannot.   *Psychologically speaking, I may be  a form of speciation.*

I cannot "wake up in 2010."
Though it may be a fun thought experiment.
Even if I could, I'm not sure I could be convinced that anything I did would produce any more or less reliable results.
I have no guarantee that anything is going to be as I remembered it from 2010-2020, and I have at least one sample indicating it is different: the fact that I'm experiencing it again - and that the experience is different.
Nothing I could do would be in isolation, as I am not some atemporal empty state / classical system "collapsing" a wave-function.  I'm in a state of superposition as well as anything else I interact with.
But I would definitely buy a shit ton o BTC, just in case.

No, there's confusion from which we all suffer, and then there's an exploitation of epistemic limitations to trick fools.
The latter is the snake oil salesman's tool.
Molyneaux changing his own username in his own youtube comments, and then forgetting to change it back - just one example of his disingenuous approach.
Some reproductive fitness noise.  Even here he's incoherent.
Clearly his statement doesn't hold up, because  if it involves rationalizing the abuse of children in the name of market worship - he's fine with what you have to say:
...regardless of how many frail, suffering, dying offspring you've spewed out (in Ingram's case: 0)
It doesn't take much, because a charlatan can never be sound and sane.  He has to lie to make his way through a world like ours, and is aided by willing sycophants  who will worship him.  Because this is what the non-cognitive noise of reproductive fitness signalling does.  Propagate.  Regardless of the harm it does.  By whatever means are available.  *It is not an intelligent process*.
Tying this back in to the original point:  BTC can solve some of the problems related to banking and the abuse of government.   It's a useful tool, and I encourage those who wish to support Molyneaux' bullshit to do so with BTC, and not cry about paypal.   It would be better for them if they'd pull their heads out of Molyneaux ass, but that's probably not going to happen.
Molyneaux is like Jordan Peterson in this regard:  Cypher from the film  "The Matrix."  They've seen the horror from which  our ape brains have evolved to hide, on average.  And instead of trying to solve the problem, they've embraced the lie, thereby perpetuating it.  Because it's easy to fleece addicts.
Given the Human predicament, *it is difficult for me to blame them* \- after all none of us makes ourselves, gives ourselves our genetic composition.

I think it is irrational to have a fixed belief on this.
I do not know what it will do.  I only know it is not impossible for it to "hit $100,000 in the next 5 years" - what I do believe is that for it to do this, many other parts of the global economic mess will have to fail in ways which will produce harm.  I find focusing only on the "silver lining" is always a mistake.  Given enough space and enough time those "externalities" *will come back to get you*.
It's counterintuitive, but we need to pay more attention to the negative, to the maladapted, to the way things fail.  Otherwise, we become deluded, our map gets mistaken for the territory, and when the territory falsifies our map to such an extreme - we die (or otherwise fuck up) in a way that is potentially avoidable.

Clearly there are those who are so triggered by the *facts* that they think a downvote, a pithy response, and logical fallacies are sound, coherent thought which will somehow accomplish anything.
Do you want to change my mind?  Give me sound reasoning.  *My mind can be changed.  Generally the Libertarian cannot.  His worship is a faith, a blind question-begging fallacy.*

Can't change your mind.The whole "change my mind" thing is a shifting of the burden of proof and seems born of intellectual dishonesty, or at least confusion.  (That sounds hostile, sorry, not intended. It's not like I don't suffer from it too).
But I agree with the assessment that it (Chart/TA) is basically nonsense, only in the sense that Humans are generally apopheniacs, and (generally!) when we do use logic at all, we do it to rationalize what our non-conscious response to stimulus has already been.
TA can be part of a process that produces some kind of chaotic feedback loop. But that's it, as far as I can tell.

There seem to be ways in which the East and Africa in general tend to have been "ahead" of Western cultures WRT suffering (i.e. with a mind to recognizing it's a problem).
Western seems "ahead" (in that sense) in some practical ways, given a certain set of assumptions, but they (we) tend to exacerbate suffering (i.e. ignorance of the significance of it WRT how we do anything at all).

Now you're confused about what facts and opinions are, and how to distinguish one from the other.
And  yes, it is a straw man, when I specifically wrote:
 *past performance is simply not an absolute guarantee of any particular range of future results* \- it can be an indicator of *probable* future results. 
Key words:  "can be" and "probable" - hence  the example of an extremely strong set of Bayesian priors in our daily little 'sunrise'  which still fails to give us absolute predictive capacity. This is  why the phrase "past performance is not an indicator of future results"  is nothing more than rhetorical CYA for exploitative con-men selling "trade systems" and TA.  
Parsimony and predictive capacity are pretty much all we have when it comes to epistemology.
We helplessly accept that past performance is - given specific patterns and relevant boundary conditions - an  indicator of future results when we cross a busy street on foot.  We have no choice, and it's actually worse than this - but that's  a different discussion.
Does this mean I claimed anyone knows exactly what BTC is going to be like in 10 years?   100 years?  I'm not sure how that follows from anything I (or the OP) wrote.

Never claimed it was.  Where does this nonsense come from?  
"Statistics" and economics are soft; subsets of physics and do not suspend epistemic limitations.  They exacerbate the limitations - helplessly - because they are soft sciences.  This does not mean they yield no predictive capacity at all, merely that it is less rigorous than, say, quantum field theory.
That's the whole point.  FFS - the delirious straw-manning is *nauseating*

It is enticing to think this way, but there is a flaw.
You cannot "not play" as long as harm-detection is mediated by pain and suffering states, no matter how much if it you may be able to endure.   Decouple those two things (nociception and pain), and then there is no such political game to worry about.  But that's the only way to solve it.
Kicking over the chess board and strutting 'round like you've won *is still playing the game* \- just incoherently.
Not to say BTC is not useful, and most of the things the article claims it is.  BTC may be one of the only paths to the necessary research to achieve something like optimized approaches / valence symmetry "pleasure states" as environmental navigation models, rather than the natural mess we're born into.

The hedonic treadmill.
Yup.  Being biology is a horror show.  Consciousness is probably an evolutionary spandrel, and a maladaptive "failure" coupled to intelligence and access to enough resources to do something about it.

I'm not interested in taking power from anyone.
I just want the "boot off my throat," so to speak.  How is that "taking power from" someone or something?What is lost there, by anyone, that is worth perpetuating for anyone involved, especially long term?
In this little analogy, the person (or thing) holding the boot on the throat has to expend energy keeping it there....  Everybody loses.  Why do it at all?  Ever?

Thanks, no I've not heard of him. Will look up, thanks
(update) Wait, yes now I've looked him up, I have read "Blindsight" - several years ago.  Was excellent.

Consciousness and homeostatic or pleasure states are all I value.
And I need no toys to have them.  I need only the absence of infliction.

It's a rhetorical technique, a red herring.
Drag the conversation into semantic distinctions that make no difference, untestable speculation about unknowable things, and pretend it's a "gotcha."

May be the case
McAffee reeks of con-man to me. That's my bias showing, but when asked what his prediction is based on all I've ever seen him say is "some math" basically.  I'm skeptical.    
Maybe he's broken it down somewhere.

The psychofuck chimp kakistocracy that thinks it's not chimps because it can reify shit will always do this.
The thing that is different now is nukes.
If WW3 breaks out we are all fucked in a way no life form has ever been fucked on this planet before, not that we know of.

I'm struggling to see that this is a sane comparison.
Faith does not = abductive / probable conclusions.  Faith is...  well it's useless.
We don't model the world with faith, we do it with heuristics.

It's just too much work to "fiatize."    
It's like trying to eat shit, rather than food.  I gag and vomit and it's so exhausting.

Excellent username. I hope it is a name held to spite your accusers.

Don't know.
Seems like it represents apophenia and primitive reasoning faculties being "hijacked" by a mindless, pointless and haphazardly self-replicating molecule.  Then the apes reify their ignorance of this, call it "god" and kill each other over whose model of the delusion is "better."

Seems like it would have many advantages, especially if some kind of transhumanism and posthumanism happens.

For sure Sapolsky, though I've not managed to get through "Behave" completely - it's a huge book.
Also Sheldon Solomon as an influence, David Pearce, etc.

 Nonsense.  
To exist as a frail conscious being aware of its own impending death (and no one knows what it is like to die) is a profound horror.
Privation is relative.
No one here is denying the horrific misery of people with less access to wealth. That's the "job" of the politicians you morons keep electing to perpetuate such a kakistocracy.
