Hitbtc's problems weren't as clear or prevalent a few months ago as they are now. And as you can find FUD about any exchange out there it isn't always obvious which are the truly unreputable ones. But yeah, if you spend 20 minutes reading about hitbtc now it should be pretty clear that risk isn't worth taking.

Lawyers at Silver Miller are considering a class action against HitBTC.  I've contacted them as I have had major problems with HitBTC, too.  They were helpful telling me what my options are.

Gemini, coinbase, kraken are all US based, well financed with relatively long histories. Bittrex and cryptopia are others gaining my trust.

Yes, but major crypto media sites are plastered with hitbtc ads, so they appear legit and probably keep getting new customers who don't read the subreddit.

HitBTC lost(stole) over 70k XEM from me.  Addresses and messages completely correct.  When I open tickets about it they take 2 weeks to address them, then move them to 'next level support', then the tickets get closed without any response 2 weeks later.  There's no denying that the deposit was made correctly of course b/c it's on the blockchain for all to see, but they refuse to credit me.  
I've been fighting this for 3 months now.

No, they did not ditch me. But they did confirm that hitbtc is more difficult to sue than the vast majority of other exchanges because hitbtc intentionally hides the owners, country where incorporated, address, etc. Another good reason to avoid using hitbtc if at all possible.
