The point of bitcoin and blockchain technology is not to bring down all government.

I am already and always will be a strong advocate against violent authoritarians. If they put the whole world in danger, I am also an advocate for removing them forcibly.

Venezuela isn't the only socialist country, and I didn't claim to be 100% socialist. Are you trying to be antagonistic?
Edit: if I believed in communism as an ideal political system, would that mean by your standards I was a hypocrite if I didn't pay with Chinese yen while living in the U.S.?

I actually don't know much about altcoins because I stay out of them, so I'm not sure if there is a definite list or not. All my hodlings are in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:09:54
All of the altcoins aren't a fraction of bitcoin like OP seemed to be implying. If I buy dogecoin and bitcoin crashes to zero, dogecoin could still be worth .00001 cents or whatever the price is.

That's not how that works...

We could probably say at the "crashes" during the timeline it would have been a better opportunity but I'm not about to do the monster math.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:18:58
I'm probably closer to a socialist than a libertarian and I'm invested heavily in bitcoin. This isn't a left or right issue.

If the best time was 20 years ago, and the second best time was 19 years 364 days ago, then yesterday would have been the 7,299th best time.

In what possible way am I a violent authoritarian?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:34:16
I haven't said "I'm a socialist" but I do lean more to that end of the political spectrum than I do to the fully libertarian end. I don't necessarily see the conflict between wanting certain services to be publicly funded, and still retaining individual freedom.

I would see me having control over my own money as a difficult problem to solve for the government, but even as a left leaning person I do not think a measure that gives me control over my financial freedom is a bad one. Sure, it's more difficult to collect taxes on such a currency but I would rather deal with that problem than scrap the entire infrastructure that I would like my taxes to support. There are still services I think should be a public right and I don't think that necessarily has to be scrapped because the government no longer has a monopoly on currency.

You seem to have a lot of gold for someone who claims to focus on bitcoin /s.

Classic troll tactic. I point out your BS and you say I'm only saying that because we disagree. What I quoted was you flat out lying, not just a disagreement. What sane human being thinks bcash is "*the real*" Bitcoin?
Edit: if you believe in it so much then transfer all your funds to bcash and I'll keep mine In core bitcoin, let's see who does better.

BUT WHICH ONE HAS THE HULK THO
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:59:15
Very simply put, people with vested interest in bitcoin cash inflated the price over the weekend and caused bitcoin core to drop, but it has since recovered. I'm not an expert on the event, however.
Edit: also there were a number of astroturfing/shill accounts in favor of Bcash

20 hours ago "bought at 11,300 sold at 8,900"
19 hours ago "now that bitcoin has crashed, what next?"
I hope to see this account again after the dip has settled down.
