Anybody else disappointed he didn't try to "shill some shitcoins bro"?

Crap, good point. All in JIM!

Anybody know if the Bolivar is two ply? Or quilted? I'm cheap but I have standards.

That's exactly what "they" *would* say

Why wait? Wells Fargo probably already has a dozen or so accounts opened in their name just waiting for them to use.

This is a truly truly horrible portmanteau. And I love it so so much. Bravo.

Has any president-elect ever eaten his own dick? Probably not (Grocery Cleveland didn't eat his own dick until *after* his inauguration).

He mixes in a little Bobcat Goldthwait for good measure.

Only an idiot would sign up for a card that gives a sign-up bonus after the first $1000 spent, buy $1000 of crypto with said card, pay off the charge with cash on hand a month later when it comes due, collect the sign-up bonus and hodl the crypto. /s

I didn't say everyone is doing it, or should do it. But your calculation kind of made my point. Prior to the cash advance change (which is clearly a new development, hence why were discussing it in this post), Coinbase charged their 4% fee. If I can get 50k miles for buying some crypto that I was going to buy anyway, and all it costs me is $40? Easy enough to use another card to get another bonus just by buying groceries and everyday purchases. Clearly only an idiot would spend $40 for those extra miles.

Much like literally anybody with any sense, I take Jamie Dimon and his JPM cronies at their word. They can say whatever they like. Regardless, you stated only an idiot would buy crypto on a credit card, which is false. No biggie.

They were really energetic! (Hahahaha) Almost artificially so... (Hahahaha)

Pretty sure that saying unfunny things with an annoying voice backed by an aggressive laugh track doesn't make one a "comedian". Although props to him for applying Big Bang Theory's shtick to "news".

Can't read either without going through the pay wall so it doesn't really matter. Either way, here we go with some QE4 BS. Buckle up, boyos!
