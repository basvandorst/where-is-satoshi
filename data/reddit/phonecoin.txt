Wow - thanks for the detailed analysis.  I'll make note of all of these points and evaluate code changes for the near future.
1) Was sort of an after thought to the service that I wasn't sure would be well received.  So thank you for the feedback!
2) I agree that I could improve upon the SMS communication.  Maybe even adding a **help** command would make things easier.
3) Ok, I could take a look at that.  The default behavior is that all commands that require a confirmation are voided if they're not confirmed, but I can see how a user would like more control over that process.  This would especially be useful if you think someone is trying to spoof your phone number... you wouldn't want a pending transaction just sitting there.
4) Yeah, I wanted to start with the SMS service and then consider other ways of accessing your account.  Maybe a form to send a bitcoin address to your phone?  Or maybe a video showing how to use a QR code to obtain a bitcoin address on your phone?  But many phones don't have copy-paste?
5) Good point on the currencies, but I think only the US and Canada can access Twilio's SMS service (that I'm using).  I can always roll out the major currencies first and add more on demand.
6) So a way for you, a phoneco.in user, to lend bitcoin?  The idea is quite interesting - I almost feel like it's a separate service.  I do think that having SMS reminders would be an extra encouragement for your friends to pay you back.  After the MBC fiasco, I wasn't sure anyone would want to use an eWallet-like service again.  I was thinking that having the ability to pay with SMS would encourage people to use phoneco.in for small transactions - I wasn't imagining that people would want this service to store a large amount of btc.  Using it to lend enough btc that you'd consider it a loan worthy of collecting interest and sending reminders is something that I never imagined.  
Thanks for the great feedback!

Yeah, this is a good point.  I'm not sure there's anything that can be done to secure text messages either.  It seems like one of those "hope that you stay under the radar" types of situations.  We need to lobby for SSL SMS!
@_date: 2011-08-20 17:24:11
Yes, I was thinking I should have an application or browser based method for access one's account.  What about the people who just use SMS though?
@_date: 2011-08-20 17:40:03
This is an interesting idea.  The service I'm using for SMS doesn't allow for MMS, but maybe I could incorporate another service that does for the MMS delivery (or switch services).

Once your messages gets to the SMS service I'm using, it is securely sent from there to my server.  The service signs all of its requests, and I reject any that don't match the expected hash.  That said, I'm not sure what kind of sniffing tools there are for cell phones.  Can someone snoop on your texts as your phone is transmitting to the tower?  This is the part of the chain that is out of my control and possibly susceptible to interception.  I do require a confirmation code for Pay or Password setting commands in an attempt to eliminate spoofing.

If you're in the US or Canada, I would recommend my service, [PhoneCo.in]( - I designed it to work in such situations.  If they have an account already, their payments are instant.  If they don't you'll know if they payed you as soon as the client knows and withdrawals are possible after ~3 confirmations.

Oddly I just got a call from someone with ExchB.  I haven't called them back yet, but perhaps they'd be the code helper type you're talking about.
I know what you're saying about excessive messaging too.  The service I'm using charges me by the SMS.  I think I have a decent balance between security and minimalism right now with the confirmation codes.  It's certainly something that can be looked at more closely.
Thanks for the interest.  I should offer a command to "Pay 555-555-5555 USD 10.50" which would do an on-the-fly currency conversion and send the appropriate amount of BTC.  Then you could really pay someone who just learned about bitcoin...
@_date: 2011-08-20 18:07:57
Yeah, setting up an email auto-reply would be far easier than what I was suggesting.  I'll look into it - I like the idea of an added layer of authentication for those who want to use the service securely.
@_date: 2011-08-20 06:30:08
I've been working on developing this site for a while and feel like it's ready for people to give it a try.  Yes it is a centralize place to store bitcoin, but it also gives the convenience of paying any cell phone with a text message.  I built the service securely, and as people use it I will work in any suggestions that I get.  Let me know what you think...

The server is now pushing hourly encrypted backups to Amazon S3 using [Arq](  I will manually generate backups and save them offline as well.
@_date: 2011-08-20 17:36:14
Yes, the confirmation code is my way of preventing spoofing.  It also requires a confirmation code for setting or changing your password so that a spoofer can't try to lock you out of your account.

The server only accepts HTTPS communication with basic authentication using a 30 character password.  The SMS service I am using launches a web browser like client to my server with every SMS they receive.  They authenticate with the server to access the processing script, but also sign the data they are delivering with an agreed upon hash.  My server verifies that the hash is legit before processing any commands.  
The server itself has dual hard disks configured with mirrored RAID.  I haven't automated a backup procedure yet, but I will push an encrypted backup of the entire bitcoin data folder to Amazon S3.

Yes, I do have the ability to set a password for your account, which would prevent someone from stealing your phone and cleaning out your phonecoin account so long as you don't have old sent text messages with your password saved on your phone.

This might be the simplest way to implement what you're suggesting.  It would require sending a test email to theirnumber for every carrier and seeing which one they confirm.  There's also the added trust/complexity issue of communication coming from more than once source associated with this service (phonecoin email and the main phone number).  But I like the idea...
@_date: 2011-08-20 21:42:50
Yup, the service is built using Twilio.  I reference it on the btc-call page because their software phone uses a flash app signed by Twilio.com, and I wanted people to know they could trust it.  Thanks for letting me know about Nexmo - I'll have to take a look at it for international SMS since Twilio doesn't support it.
