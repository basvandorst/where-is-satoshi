Yes, governments can ban bitcoin.  Many people seem to focus only on the underlying protocol when this question gets asked.  Of course, governments can't ban "math" but that's missing the point.  At some point, that "math" has to make contact with physical reality.  Those areas of the economy where bitcoin is exchanged for physical goods could be easily regulated to prevent merchants from accepting it as payment.  With a US ban of bitcoin, it's very likely that every other developed nation would view bitcoin in a similar light and institute their own bans.  The smaller countries where it's still legal would be forced to cave under immense international pressure.  Venezuela is an exception to this because it's government has essentially collapsed and can't effectively enforce a ban.

Maybe.  But according to Chris Burniske on Twitter, the magic point at which that happens is around $100 a Bitcoin.  At that point, a hard fork split between the SegWit and BU communities isn't going to cause a big panic.  I don't think anyone understands this.  A BU split isn't going to cause the price of Bitcoin to plummet.  The price of Bitcoin plummeting is going to cause a BU split.  There's your moment of Zen.

This is a very intellectually dishonest article.

Bitcoin is doing just fine.  It's people's feelings that are getting hurt.

Transaction fees and transaction throughput are inversely proportional.  You can't have it both ways.  Eventually miners have to come to the realization that unless transaction fees come down and throughput goes up, they are precluding the use case for millions of new users.  Block size increases do not solve this problem but only kick the can down the road while simultaneously squeezing out the smaller mining pools and centralizing hash power.

Actually it does because there is usually a currency triangle involved such as BTC/USD, ETH/BTC, and ETH/USD where if you sold BTC for ETH, you would raise the rate on the ETH/BTC pair creating an arbitrage opportunity which would quickly cause the BTC/USD pair to fall or the ETH/USD pair to rise until equilibrium is achieved.

You're making the assumption that the point of contention is a technical one.  I feel that if the Bitcoin Core team said tomorrow, "Ok, you win. We'll help develop and deploy Bitcoin Unlimited over SegWit."  Most of the BU "supporters" would immediately claim that BU was unacceptable and switch to something else.  I feel that this whole SegWit/BU debate is merely a proxy for a wider political agenda.

If your primary concern about Bitcoin is its price then YOU are the one hurting Bitcoin.  Don't be under the mistaken impression that Bitcoin is a mature technology.  Bitcoin in its current form is not ready for global adoption.  The market cap and daily transaction of Bitcoin are barely a drop in the bucket compared to the global economy.  The issues that we are facing now with the BU vs SegWit debate are exciting times for Bitcoin and represent a hurdle that all cryptocurrencies must eventually face on their path to adoption.

SegWit is already a compromise.  It gives the miners an increase in block size while avoiding the unproven and risky features of dynamic block scaling and hard forks.  I have yet to see any technical argument for why BU proponents refuse to adopt SegWit.  SegWit is thoroughly developed, tested, reviewed, and ready to go TODAY and would alleviate many of the problems that users complain about.  Please, someone correct me if I'm wrong.

This has already been done.  It's called Litecoin.

Price is important but I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's everything.  Bitcoin is distinct in that we explicitly know the factors contributing to the health of the network because the rules of the network are stated in the protocol.  Also, the price of Bitcoin at this time is largely due to speculation.  We should keep that in mind.

What do you mean that Segwit as a soft fork is a hack?  Bitcoin has already gone through several successful soft forks.  It's a proven iteration technique.
