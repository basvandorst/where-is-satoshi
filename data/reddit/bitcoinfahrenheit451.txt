No it can't be avoided, but what can be avoided is giving them the ability to censor because of the policy on consensus. Paid and private interests shouldn't be considered as part of consensus, they should be considered paid and private interests. See the point?
Core developers taking a paycheck from a for-profit company shouldn't be able to censor discourse. That includes Gavin, Peter Todd, almost all of them. Neither should Coinbase.

The problem with your definition of "consensus":


Is that 2/5 of the individuals with commit access for core are on the blockstream payroll. Large exchanges represent industry interests, and most recognized bitcoin experts are taking payola from various companies and interest groups. 
So, what I'm saying Theymos, is you are actively encouraging and even facilitating corruption of the bitcoin protocol. What say you?

Adam Back didn't write anything about Bitcoin until 2013, regardless of what the marketing team says at blockstream. The branding of him as "the godfather of bitcoin" is a joke, and he's done far more to hurt bitcoin than to help it. Hashcash was a basic technology of bitcoin, but that wasn't its genius.
Nick Szabo, most are not even sure that's the same guy anymore. His writing style is completely different, and there's much evidence that his name is a pen name.
I'm assuming you are in the "paid by blockstream" group?
