Explain? Do you really need it explained? A guy living in poverty in the Philippines can transfer his wealth to his wallet and move between borders without inflation and fear of state control of his wealth. Nation states will lose power and the world will be forced to work together to be able to function and control wealth. We'll see less and less emphasis on borders/nations and more on globalized citizenship. Sorry if that doesn't fit into your views of ethnocentrism or nationalism but that's floodgates that we've opened and there is no going back. Keep supporting crypto though I love how you are unwittingly hastening the rise of a single Global world view ;)

It's hell on earth because one country rapes/pillages and burns down another one. When you can no longer do that the entire world is just one giant nation. When you're standing from the moon, the "borders" don't exist. Crypto is the PERFECT step in the direction of making borders disappear. In the same way the internet took away the borders for access to information. You can still live in the dinosaur age or accept that a "world" culture of peace and prosperity is what we're working towards thanks to Bitcoin a guy in Venezula can move his entire net worth to anywhere in the world and be as rich as wealthy guy in France or America. So why don't you just leave? Maybe go live in the woods in a bunker.

 "With sound money" you realize that money won't be the fiat printed US dollar anymore right? Once a global currency like Bitcoin takes over then the entire world won't be at the whim of the petro dollar.

You might want to google “How to make a mint: The cryptography of anonymous electronic cash.” This document, released in 1997 — yes, twenty years ago — detailed the overall structure and function of a possible cryptocurrency. 9 years isn't much time either. The internet was invented for 30-40 years before it was mainstream adopted. We could be seeing a slow roll at different stages or phases based on how public perception plays out. Who knows the truth I just find it hard to believe the Govt has NO idea who Satoshi is.

You really don't think the FBI/CIA doesn't know who Satoshi is/was? They traced him and figured it out ages ago to make sure he wasn't some rouge state operative. He technically did not break any laws so he's been left alone. That's if you don't believe the entire idea of crypto was created by the NSA and or funded by Darpa to push forward the mass adoption of a global internet currency replacing the dollar.

Are you kidding? The internet made borders vanish. Russian trolls can spread propaganda messages from bot farms to a country without every leaving a basement. The access to information is completely borderless. I'm optimistic that Crypto is the first step to a globalized unified planet. Once the entire world is no longer using a single fiat printed US dollar as the global reserve than entire power structures will falter. A guy living in poverty in the Philippines can transfer his wealth to his wallet and move between borders without inflation and fear of state control of his money. Nation states will lose power and the world will be forced to work together to be able to function. We'll see less and less emphasis on borders/nations and more on globalized citizenship.

No it isn't. You can't run into a building a say FIRE FIRE and call it Free Speech. You also can't use a private company service that has explicit Terms and Conditions against what they deem Hate Speech and or Discriminatory views. In Alex's case he is constantly calling for death to religious groups he hates, makes threats against Hillary/several high ranking democrats and spreads outright lies about victims of school shootings. He isn't being arrested and thrown in jail because of "free Speech" but he damn well doesn't get free access to every private company service he wants.

Cryopreservation with a company called Alcor. I **HIGHLY** recommend it. Worst case: you're dead anyways so whether your body is worm food six feet under dirt or frozen in a capsule makes no difference. Best case: you're returned from suspended animation in a couple centuries when the tech has caught up. Live again as an immortal in an advanced civilization.

First off you have it all wrong there is no flash freezing taking place. The current technology favored by Alcor is vitrification, not freezing. Vitrification is an ice-free process in which more than 60% of the water inside cells is replaced with protective chemical.

That's not exactly how it works. Costs for older members are continually covered by future members who pay to freeze themselves. It's a bit complicated to get into but Alcor has been around for several decades now if you want to research it more. Could the entire business not survive 100 years from now? Sure the whole planet could fall into Mad Max world and  your frozen body in a chamber will just thaw out and turn to worm food. But that's the risk, there's a .000001% of being brought back to life in the future. If you just cremate yourself the chance of being brought back is 0%

No he's a 100% paid Russian tool. Throughout WikiLeaks’ existence, he has very well-documented connections to the Russian state. Ranging from sharing purloined documents with a pro-Russian dictator to Assange receiving money for appearing on Russian state TV to WikiLeaks’ key involvement in NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden ending up in Russia. At this point you're either delusional or just part of the useful idiots of the Russian propaganda machine. Assange is all about self preservation. WikiLeaks—citizens of the world that they are—never seem able to leak anything damaging to the interests of the Russians. They likewise avoid antagonizing the Chinese or any other autocratic regime that might take umbrage or engage in retaliation.
WikiLeaks is a functional subsidiary of Vladimir Putin’s intelligence services and Assange—hiding in a London embassy—is on the end of a long but firm Russian string.

You're laughable alternate facts are obviously pulled from Tucker Carlson and fake Faux news.  Like I said California gained 35,500 jobs, and unemployment fell to a record-low 4.4%. 
Texas property taxes are how they offset income taxes. Basically bleeding the honest land owning population by having every state budget session end with increases in property taxes. A 250K home in texas is taxed at $5K but the same exact home is paying only $1,900 in Los angeles that's more than DOUBLE! 
And Texas has just as many infrastructure issues plaguing its freeways and rural areas. If you're not in Houston or San Antonio the freeways are crumbling dirt asphalt that hasn't been updated in ages. It is a federal issue not a state one that needs addressing by congress.
Austin is definitely turning more Blue and democratic which is great to see and hopefully it will turn the tide in Texas to a Blue state in the near future but most of the tech companies are startups rather than Apple, Intel, Sun Microsystems or tech giants that will always call Silicon Valley home. Sorry but if anything MORE money is pouring into Silicon Valley with crypto and blockchain startups in california taking off.
