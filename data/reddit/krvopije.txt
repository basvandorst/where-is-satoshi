Yeah, there are so many other good "news" Dandelion++ and so on, but could you explore more which of the implementations is targeting those things in the next release. LND, c-lightning, eclaire? All of them? I dont think they are all currently at the same point of development if I am not mistaking.

Are there any news about the next update including the ability to receive through eclair?

Thanks for the answer. Its kinda strange, I see just 2 comments and I expected to get a lot more different viewpoints and pros + cons on graphene, CTOR and blockweight increase in general. 
I am totally with you, I am not willing to increase the blockweight to levels on which I cant run my full node as a 0815 citizen, therefore I am not really willing to increase it unless we have other upgrades which keep the needed resources at the level we are currently without the increase or slightly above.

Thx, I will look up both links and reply if I have something I want to say or questions.

Well I also thought he mixed it up with MAST, but in the comments I didnt see anyone doubting it, so I thought I must have missed this news. To my knowledge it is also still in debate to integrate CT in the near future, but as I said, I am more than willing to accept being wrong on this on. :D
