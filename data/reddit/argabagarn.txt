Im not very interested in economy and banks etc. Im totally in it for the money.

yeah my wording is not the best. I'm just generally concerned about how faith in the US impacts peoples will to educate them selves. NASA has 0.5% GDP, while the military has 54%. If people were reasonable enough to vote for a person who actually understands what's important that would be switched. We would have colonised Mars and ended global warming by now.
When I remember that Donald Trump is the president of the most influential superpower in the world it makes me lose all hope in the human race.

honestly I think a big part of the problem in the US is that people(parents)are generally dumb as a consequence of your very religious culture. It feels like alot of people especially in the bible belt have no scientific education or knowledgeable which in it self leads to people not thinking logically/critically. 
I have only met a few people in Sweden who are openly religious. it is kind of shunned to believe in a supernatural entity like Jesus Christ here.
while in the US 95% believes in God.
IMO there is a pretty clear correlation.
Atheists generelly are more prone to embrace technonogical advancements and ideaologies that benefit the mass instead of individualls.

Even us swedes who have very good education system don't learn alot about economical utilities(?) in hs. I think it is for a good reason tho, partly because economy is the most boring class to teenagers which would result in no-one paying attention. Also the education system isn't made to fully cover every aspect of life, some things should be learnt from your parents; Economy, paying bills, taxes and loans etc.

I completely agree with your point. Im not saying that everyone in the US is dumb or uneducated. The most respected scientists in the world are american and you have some of the best universities in the world.
Growing up religious doens't automatically mean that you will be a e.g homophobe or uneducated.
But growing up truly believing that a 2000 year old fairy tale happened and will happen again *generally* tends to make people less prone to understand how important scientific and societal advancements really are. Today there are very few religious scientists, even in the US.
And in my experience religious people tend to be much more selfish and bigoted.
Also: *Donald Trump* is POTUS, this fact blows my mind every day. He was elected by a majority of the people and i think that says alot about the American population.

How and what transactions are spam? Can you elaborate?

I know, but im thinking of all the newbies that is still introduced to cryptos. Seeing the fees will probably scare off alot of people. Especially when its mainpurpose was/is fast easy and cheap global transactions.

Yeah.. im not buying into something that is simply a shortterm solution run by a phishing marketingteam.

Maybe its not relevant how long ive owned bitcoin, but that wasnt really the topic of the thread...
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:12:18
Yeah, i will never sell. Cryptos are for sure the future and this is just the beginning.

why is it not sustainable?
