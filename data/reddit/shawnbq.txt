Automatic withdrawals below a decent threshold is a must (like Celsius and others). Your "security concerns" argument doesn't hold water, and it's the biggest reason why I'm not moving funds from Celsius to BlockFi, despite the lower rates (plus level of transparency and engagement). You prefer paying salaries to folks to do manual labor approving withdrawals instead of investing in development of decent tech security in your website (there is no app). It took you months before you added 2fa at all and I hear withdrawals still don't require it. No wonder your customers got hacked ...

Poor handling of support and policy there. When exactly was this?
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:00:59
Noted. Thanks for your insight. What about the actual question?
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:27:25
What's on Jan 3rd 2020? You're talking about Eth 2.0?

Default treatment was uncool. When exactly was this?
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:26:30
Yeah, customer support told me it's up to 1 business day. See my P.S. though, they do not actually guarantee 1 day. In fact, they reserve the right to take as long as they wish.

\&gt;   I do imagine though that Reddit would blow up about it if they started failing to pay out collateral.
That, and the fact that they capped first at 100 then at 25 then at 5 BTC for 6% interest is actually a positive in my view (see my P.S. in the original post)

I understand it was announced (perhaps not so efficiently) but the decrease to me is actually good news, as I commented in my p.s. in the original post. Used to be 100 BTC in fact. But that's all offtopic. Did you use BlockFi, and if yes, would you care to answer to questions in the original post?

Yes, noted, but I've already stated that's besides the scope of this thread

Got it, thanks :). Coincides with the announced Eth 2.0 date.
