The [Third Key website]( actually lists Armory as a wallet they use. Even more interesting is that a top employee of a multi billion dollar company like Accenture would join Armory.

* 1. Make sure your cold storage is really cold: Always generate new wallets (or power on your offline computer) in the cold storage "sanctuary"  (add an appropriate amount of acoustic foam to prevent a "Covert Acoustical Mesh Network" AKA bad bios) 
Or just take your laptop on a hike to a remote area anytime you need to power it on and sign transactions or generate new wallets.
* 2. Use an old tape recorder and minimodem  to carry data in and out of you cold storage area and to communicate with your offline machine. DO NOT allow any other electronics into the cold storage area. This is so cool: 
* 3. Up your game with geographically separated Armory multisig using different computer hardware to generate each key.  Armory's RNG is very good (read full thread)  But if you really must mess with it generate one or two of your multisig keys with a deck of cards 
* 4. For the love of all that is good NEVER touch a windows OS computer. Also print out the Armory paper backups. Use the fragmented back feature in Armory if physical security is a concern.

[CRITICAL] Windows users: **Stop using Windows NOW!**
Seriously, if you are using a Windows computer for handling  Bitcoin you are *begging* to get robbed.

A USB is NOT REQUIRED to use Armory Cold Storage. Your moving about half a page of text/DATA from your online machine to your off-line machine. After you sign the transaction you move that data back you online machine and broadcast it to the network. You can burn the text to a CD, print it out in QR codes or even move the data through a modem using something like this:

Thanks for this Guide. It should be noted that Armory is for Bitcoin power users, not noobs. If you try to tell someone new to Bitcoin to use Armory it will confuse the hell out of them.

etotheipi, thanks for the additional info. This makes sense for business users. I'm still wrapping my head around all this..

Here is a good interview Alan just did with Jamie McCormick: 
"It’s up to users to voluntarily tell us whatever information to us they feel comfortable revealing. However, through the process of providing support for users and organizations, we’ve acknowledged at least 300,000 BTC held directly by Armory wallets of our users."
