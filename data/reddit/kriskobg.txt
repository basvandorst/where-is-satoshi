Bitcoin is a good currency for transactions guys

You are quite honestly delusional. Focus on yourself and getting a job and starting to put savings in a traditional retirement account. Having $300 of bitcoin is not going to retire you, nor is it in anyway a wise place to put money you will need in the future

Did you just assume my wallets gender you daft cunt?

Wait more. Took me 13 hours yesterday with 140 sat/byte and it was less clogged than today

You should not be investing in anything, you should be reading
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:59:03
Correct. The amount you are willing to pay for a fee dictates how fast your transaction is mined in a block. So if you have a low or even average fee right now, it will take a long time
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:04:58
It's going to take a while as the network is getting hammered. Depending on how big your fee was you can see how many blocks it would take here 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:50:14
How high are you

Prepare to wait over 30 hours

Please get a hobby and stop writing stupid shit on the internet.

They are safe, prepare to wait ~15 hours for a confirmation
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:02:25
Your transaction is going to take over 12-15 hours if it's an average to low fee
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:41:41
Better order my coffee 16 hours in advance

Lmao this sub is delusional 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:52:09
That's a low fee at the moment, it will take over 12 hours

Stop submitting this stupid image over and over. Thanks - Everbody

Not even relevant. We aren't profiting off of the collapse of the economy

Get in and HODL on or keep thinking "what if"

Because any time bitcoin drops $4.98 there is a thread about why it's crashing. Read up on this shit. It's insanely volatile

Bunch of retards
