Btc on coinbase is 400$ more expencive than worldcoinindex.com like they expect people will start buying soon. And honestly it would be crazy to bet agains bitcoin unless there is some heavy manipulation. But keep in mind bitcoin was unregulated till tomorrow. Now it is entering regulated mainstream waters. Which means if somebody manipulates the market on purpose can actually go to jail.  Also people were not investing into btc because they were not sure if it is gonn be legal or banned. In the begging people in usa were also getting arrested in some cases for getting involved with bitcoins. Now going on wall street it means bitcoin became officially  legal in USA. For example coin base could not sell btc in states of NY , Hawaii and a few others. So in tha long run bitcoin will go up like crazy now when official , big money, legal investors get into the game. So lets wait for tomorrow. But this might be just a game to scare people to sell their bitcoins for the last time before the rocket ship takes off to the sky. Any opinions on this? Do u expect big players will short or buy bitcoins tomorrow?

What do u guys think it is gonna happen? More people investing into btc because fork uncertainity is removed? Or sell off because people are not getting their free segwit2x coins? Or it is just a market manipulation, and a few days later they say “ oh we changed our mind again, there will be segwit2x?
