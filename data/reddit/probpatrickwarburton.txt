Nah. You can still squeeze a decent hashrate from a CPU running. You're certainly not going to want to only CPU mine, but it's something.

Dude fucking owns Amazon, is basically the richest person on earth, and only just now have you heard his name? Exactly how large of a rock do you live under? Also welcome to civilization,  this is the internet...
Edit: I'm wrong I get it... and I might've come off as an asshole. In my head it was more jokingly. I'm just leaving it up for context. My apologies.
@_date: 2019-07-20 03:15:58
Huh, it seems I'm the one living under the big rock here...

I think the train of thought here is that may have been the case before, but nowadays what's the point?

Bulletproofs. ~80% reduction in transaction size. Should equal about the same reduction in fees.

If Monero was forced to expand to Bitcoin volumes, it would be.
And you're right. I meant when, or if, it's done/usable it will be. I just didn't type that out because I figured it was rather self explanatory...
@_date: 2018-08-31 17:39:34
I have. But apparently you just want to make weird, nonsensical arguments.

No one said anything about disk space. And actually, the main concern with running a node at that volume of tx would be bandwidth to receive all incoming block information. Which would affect latency all over the network. 
Not that it really matters at the moment. I'll keep using it, Monero being a smaller volume cryptocurrency doesn't take away from its usefulness to me, or anyone else.
Also, grin is a tokenized asset. I want a currency. So no thanks.

A scam is a scam. Wether you call it BCH or Scientology...

Probably the best answer here. You have to use a practical buying power comparison in this instance. This is a perfect example of exactly that...

I mean, I just double checked. It's more like $132,400. However, that's within a fair margin given the price fluctuating every second.

Yeah. Who ever said fiat had real/significant value?
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:43:07
You're not wrong. But its probably Bitcoin that brought them to the 1%ers club and not vice versa

Marketing one thing as another is definitely fraud. If I agree to sell you a used Lamborghini for $500,000. You hand me the money and when I come to deliver it, I hand you a played with model Lamborghini. By your insight, I've not performed anything illegal. However, no matter what you think, it's still fraud. Knowing misrepresentation of an asset for sale is fraud, in short, calling Bitcoin Cash by anything but Bitcoin Cash is a misrepresentation.

Bit of advice I've learned over the years in this. If it has a development team with pre-mined resources, it's most likely not decentralized in any significant way. Therefore, it's hardly any different than just using a credit card and banks for your money, at least good ol government backed moolah is more accepted than whatever shitcoins you're researching.
Additionally, if it needs marketing, then it's probably not actually similar to currency in a usable form. If someone is marketing something to you, then you're just a customer. Nobody has to sell you on the idea that the USD or the Euro has value, so why is there so many hundreds of thousands of dollars spent by these useless tokens everywhere trying to assure people that what they're hawking on the side of the exchange is legit? Nobody has to sell you on the idea of Bitcoin, you're already here. Look at coins that aren't marketed and have community donated development funds. Bitcoin, Monero, and maybe even one or two others but that's about it...
Tldr: whatever shitcoins you're looking at, it's probably not worth further investigation into, and your investment would be significantly better off in any of the other legitimate cryptocurrencies.
