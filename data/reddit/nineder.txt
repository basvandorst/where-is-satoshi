Lol. No closer than two years ago? Have you tested anything? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:36:20
Sorry for the delay, wasn't at my PC for a proper response :-)


But how is this different than transaction spamming the blockchain now?


What if there are other ways to create channels cheaply so that high fees are seen as a "security feature" rather than an impediment?
Some of the ideas I currently can think of:
1. Subsidized fees to open/close channels, like how GDAX and Gemini pay for fees now.
2. Wallets or exchanges opening and closing channels as batch transactions, reducing the effective fee per channel.
3. Channel factories so that a user only needs a single on-chain fee to open unlimited channels (can also be combined with points 1 and 2)  (Read more: 


TRUE! haha


It would absolutely still handle on-demand payments. Think of it this way:
When you have 0 channels, you are 0% connected to the LN. You know you will want to transact on it in the future so you open a channel.
Now you have 1 channel and you are 87% connected to the network. In other words, there is an 87% chance you can pay whoever you want to pay. But you want better.
So your wallet software determines that if you open a certain other channel, you will be 97% connected.
Now you have 2 channels and you can pay 97% of people/businesses on the LN. You decide this is good enough and no need for more channels.
I'm just making these numbers up right now, but it should be possible for a wallet to calculate *exactly* what channels need to be opened to achieve 99.9% connectedness.
**IMPORTANT:** This sounds complex, but solving the complexity is the responsibility of app developers. It is *not* the users' job. All of this can and will happen seamlessly behind the scenes with user friendly buttons and messages.
How complex is the Reddit or Facebook code behind the scenes? But all of that is hidden to the user. Because of this, it amazes me to hear arguments that LN is too complicated while people use very complicated apps every day of their lives (not saying you are using this argument)

Maybe pool the money across channels together in the interface. Then move money between channels via LN as needed. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:39:22
That’s another solution I hadn’t thought of. Great! 
This would be “steaming money,” which is one of the example use cases in the LND tutorials 
Thanks for this comment!

Payments can be split up and sent over multiple routes.
Also payments can be sent from multiple of your channels at once. 
The net effect is the correct amount ending up at your recipient and the payment request being completed. 
Sending 2btc maybe will take 15 different routes to find enough channel capacity. But your wallet will handle all those details for you seamlessly.

End users don’t need to. Check out eclair wallet for android. It just works. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:05:01
And that is just a first gen LN wallet. We are going to see some awesome wallet features next year with this increased ability for innovation. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:42:35
A big hole in your PayPal analogy is that with PayPal they are intermediary to everyone. With LN, the shop can take payments from anywhere without the users ever interacting with the settlement company. The settlement company is not a payment processor. They are simply for the shops to cash out to fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:08:21
Download an android emulator for you pc and install the app. 
There is also a lightning desktop wallet that is cross platform and does not require any full nodes 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:06:54
Widespread segwit adoption is not a requirement for LN. Only LN wallets need to be segwit enabled. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:00:46
Haha. That’s a much loftier goal and we don’t need to get there tomorrow.
One step at a time, as more and more can be done with the chain. This is what LN is unlocking... more and more use cases. 
All existing financial services (e.g. lending) could be built as layers on top of bitcoin as the underlying security. 
But to be honest, I think that will come from the entire crypto ecosystem, probably not from a single chain.
How exactly do you see central banking becoming obsolete? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:13:29
All it requires is someone with a LN balance that is willing to sell you some BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:18:11
The final 1.0 spec was just released on Dec 6
The ecosystem needs to continue to develop and be used on the testnet. After that has gone on without ANY lost (test) funds, then it will be ready for mainnet. 
Ecosystem = LN wallets and (test) shops 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:37:54
That’s a free market choice. There doesn’t need to be only one.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:09:55
You only need to know basic Linux shell commands to set up and test a node. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:29:03
This is not a helpful discussion as many of the points in my OP refute the arguments in these links. If you would like to have a discussion, please copy paste a few specifics you believe are important that *are not* addressed in my OP... *or* tell me your arguments against my points in the OP.
Looking forward to it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:21:32
Also, it is irrelevant how technically complicated it is. That is a problem for developers to solve. The user needs to know nothing of the inner workings.
Have you tested the Eclair Android wallet? And that is only a first gen LN wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:04:23
People like you don’t seem to understand that you’ll be able to refill your LN balance from *within* LN, without an individual on-chain transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:29:35
I have only testing the LND implementation, but since the protocol is standard, I’m assuming the other two work the same way.
From what I can tell, all of this is already possible from the API. It is now up to wallet developers to build these implementations.
But I believe the incentives are there. Don’t underestimate the speed of innovation.
I realize LN has been in development for a long time now, but LND works wonderfully as it is now. I wouldn’t be surprised if these solutions are already in development by third parties. 
And once everyone agrees enough testing has been done for main net use, these use cases (and more) will be released. There is a much more compelling reason for them than there is for segwit adoption. 
Using the LN does not require any more changes to bitcoin. It only requires confidence that bugs are sufficiently squashed to be used on mainnet. 
Similarly, building apps to work on the LN requires no permission or consensus. These services can be built as freely as Wordpress plugins.

Users might not need a metaphor for which channels hold their btc within the lightning network if the wallet software can manage all that behind the scenes.
Then they only need “savings wallet” and “spending wallet (LN)”
Say the user has 300 mBTC in their spending wallet (and 4 open channels)
a) 100 mBTC
b) 75 mBTC
c) 75 mBTC
d) 50 mBTC
They want to send 200 mBTC to another user.
The wallet could calulate the best path and either:
- send 75 from a, 75 from b, 50 from d for a total of 200 (assuming a payment request can be filled from multiple sending addresses)
- send some funds from b,c,d into a, then send from a to the recipient (if the payment request must be filled from a single sender)
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:39:54
Only 2 users per channel. And you don’t need to know the people you channel up with. No need for a payment company to have 1000 channels. They only need enough to be sufficiently connected.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:38:34
Read up on LN.  This is beyond the scope of this thread as it is has been covered extensively.
There is no counterparty risk.
There are no lightning tokens. It uses real BTC (or whatever other coin a channel is on). And there is plenty of security in place. 
The risk of your LN wallet getting hacked is the same as any hot wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:31:23
You misunderstand how LN will work in the real world.
- Businesses will be able to use a settlement company (like they do with bitpay) without ever closing their channel(s) on the LN.
- Wallets will automatically (with user confirmation) create a high quality channel for the user that connects them to the graph.
- If not sufficiently connected, it can make another (with user confirmation).
- Once on the LN, users can buy BTC from an exchange on the LN to “top off” their channels without having to settle on the blockchain
- Just like GDAX currently pays transfer fees, companies will emerge to pay channel creation fees. You pay them $50 to create a channel for you. You get a channel with a $50 balance in your favor. I believe companies can make these fees insignificant by batching the on chain transactions. 
- Over time, channel factories will be introduced, allowing wallets to open, rebalance, and close channels instantly and free (no on chain settlement).
Ultimately, all it will take is a user opening a single channel to get well connected to the graph. And you can bet there will be market incentives for doing so. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:27:41
You have it backwards. Avoiding $30 fees IS an incentive.
See my points here about why fees wont matter and regarding topping up your channel —yes, of course that will be possible ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:20:10
There is no major incentive for **most users** to adopt segwit, so wallets aren’t losing users by not doing so. 
There will be huge incentives to adopt LN. Developers will see the opportunities and build the solutions. And they will siphon users from those that do not support it. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:42:43
Google Play...
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:11:43
Exactly, all solutions built *on top* of the main chain are 100% opt-in (optional). You don’t like one, don’t use it. You don’t like any, don’t use any. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:44:20
*Would need to be held in your total LN balance. 
The total amount can be sent over multiple routes and/or streamed in increments to your recipient to fill the payment request to 100%
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:23:09
Thanks for the discussion!


What manipulation tactic specifically are you thinking of? Your description seems a bit vague to me. Without an exact tactic or desired outcome, there is nothing to rebuttal. Sorry if I've missed any details. 


fees their echoes can disrupt basic economic operations.
Good point. We cannot predict what the block reward will be going into the future. Maybe fees will continue to rise, keeping the hash power there, and keeping the difficulty up. Or maybe the fees will drop, we will lose some hashing power, and the difficulty will drop.
What you are arguing is that the miners might not accept the LN? And would try manipulation to sabotage it? I guess we will have to see how this plays out and then cross that obstacle when it arrives.


It doesn't necessarily have to. The high fees ensure a larger block reward which ensures more hashing power which translates into more security. If wallets can create channels in batch transactions, than the individual channel fee can be small. Channels do not need to be created on demand, so they can be created when it is not time-critical.
And then there is my point about fee subsidizing like GDAX currently does.
And with channel factories, your on-chain transactions to enter/exit the LN could be very, very infrequent. Only when you want to move BTC to/from cold storage. But remember, you could add to your LN balance from within the LN, convert to other crypto within the LN, or convert to fiat within the LN


You don't need to know who your channels are with, and therefore it doesn't make a difference if you have a channel with a restaurant or some random person across the world.
And again, opening and closing channels does not need to happen as often as people are thinking. Once you are on, you can stay in that ecosystem as long as you want. The blockchain is only needed to secure the LN, for cold storage, etc. 


LN is perfect for time sensitive payments. They are instant.
How does it matter what the transaction is for? Does Visa have different processes for food, gasoline, televisions, etc?


Again, thank you very much for the discussion! Looking forward to more.

These centralized companies would be *using* the decentralized network. In *no way* managing it. 
BIG difference. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:40:47
Wrong. A LN wallet also works on the main chains. This is a requirement of all LN wallets by design.
