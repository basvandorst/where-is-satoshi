Of course it's confirmed...
You know it's halving every 4 years. Right now a miner gets 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes.
You could basically do the math yourself to find out the last coin will be mined around the year 2140.

If we both hold our wealth in Bitcoin and both want to hold it equally bad then we're in a tug of war of holding. But I'm also running a coffee shop selling coffee for what used to be $5 dollars which equals about 50k satoshis. Now I'm going to lower my price just enough until you reach a point where you are finally willing to pay for the coffee. If you pay in dollars it will be $5 but if you pay in bitcoin it will for example only by 35k satoshis instead of 50k (or less wherever the sweet spot is revealed to be before people start buying again).
People think deflation is a bad thing, but that's because it has only ever happened when countries have been close to economic collapse. Why else would a government let its currency deflate. A government have the power to do inflation, which means when there is a hyperdeflation in fiat currency it's because that country was already on the path for economic collapse and is choosing not to inflate.

I don't see how that proves anything though. It might only help to discourage them even further. If it was a bubble some people would still get rich for it as long as they got out before a crack.
Proving that some people got rich is in no way an argument for it not being a bubble.
A far better argument is telling them why the technology is going to be revolutionary and why banks are unneeded middlemen taking a large part of the cake.

It's said to prove that the value can only go up because you cannot inflate the price of 1 Bitcoin and therefore a good argument to buy now instead of later.

That is the stupidest thing I've read all day.
Saying "I could care less" doesn't tell anyone anything about how much you care. Your level of "care" on a scale could be anywhere from 0.00000000000001 to infinity. 
It's a nonsensical statement and should be treated as such.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:32:29
Yeah I think you're right. The banks would be able to do the same thing as they did in 2008 with bitcoin. Bitcoin can only ensure that the Federal Reserve is not messing with it, unless they print dollars to buy bitcoin in which case they will wreck the dollar way more than they will wreck bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:00:32
So what are you arguing against bitcoin for?
If the USD is unlinked to large part of the economy anyway why shouldn't we switch to a global currency not surveilled and controlled by central banks and governments.
It has lower cost, global reach, is divisible to infinity, is 100% digital, removes the administration fees that comes with banks, etc...
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:55:52
You are implying that Bitcoin never was at $2.31 which is incorrect. Bitcoin already made that jump, and then it made another and another and another. Something Dogecoin haven't done.

When trading, value only exists in the minds of intelligent beings. In other words: Value is created in the eyes of the beholder.
That also means anything people are willing to buy at a certain price has that value.
If the world was made up of clones of me, gold would have far less value. Probably under 5% of its current worth. Because all the clones of me would only deem gold valuable in production of other things. Not for its shining- nor for its store of value capabilities.

So tell me how there is a hierarchy in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:38:23
Pretty sure all the wallets from this site let you choose your own fee:
You have to understand the fee is set to encourage miners to include your transaction into a block. If you set it very low you might have to wait in the queue for a long time before a miner choose to include it.
Exchanges where you can buy Bitcoin for other currencies often set a high transaction fee for the miners to ensure your transaction goes through close to instantly.
EDIT: I would recommend Electrum, Breadwallet and Mycelium :)

@_date: 2017-12-18 20:55:47
I absolutely have no idea what people mean when they say it. I just interprete it as they wanted to say they didn't care a lot but instead said almost the exact opposite in a very unspecific way. Saying 'cold' when you wanted to say 'hot'.
I have no idea where on the "care scale" they are because it's so unspecific. Maybe they care infinitely much about some topic, which is the reason they are able to care less. That would mean they were very passionate about that topic or they could care almost nothing about the topic. I would have no idea of knowing. So you've now created a statement that tells us nothing.
'I couldn't care less' is great because it tells you exactly what a person thinks. Like saying "No one could care less than I". It tells you in what end of the scale a person is in regards to his careness level.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:02:26
Absolutely. First I would suggest you try to understand what bitcoin is and what it could become. There is no one better to explain it than Andreas:
And then go to:
To understand how to get going. Tere are a lot of exchanges on the list on that site. Most people just use coinbase or gdax.
And "hodl" is just a misspell of hold. It's some reference to a guy in a thread long ago who told he was gonna outsmart everyone by just holding his bitcoins because he is an otherwise shit investor. And to be honest if he is still holding to this day he is probably a multimillionaire.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:28:34
You're right, I should have been more specific. When you trade directly for a good this is the case. 
Stocks, bonds and other financial vehicles are a bit more special because it requires consumers that buy products from that company to believe in the value of the product that company is selling. This is what makes profit possible for that company which allows the stock to gain value.


The reason to buy bitcoin would be the same reason you would buy Tesla stocks.
By looking at Tesla stock you can see they are way overpriced in comparison to the company's profit. This is because much of the value comes from expected future potential.
That is also why you should only invest in bitcoin if you believe in it.

@_date: 2017-12-01 18:11:47

I think bitcoin will go up quickly after Christmas 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:31:37
The transaction fee is market based...
Your transaction fees will always be way lower than the amount you send whatever that amount is. Because ***you control*** the transaction fee (unless you use a badly designed wallet).
You could actually choose to pay zero bits in transaction fees but depending on the congestion on the network and what other people have paid you might have to wait a long time before your transaction goes through.
If the price of a bitcoin goes up that means the cost of mining transactions can be done for less bitcoin (power will cost less), because a bitcoin has become more valuable.
In other words, it isnt a flat fee as you are suggesting it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:48

Even so, organic material obviously deteriorates... You'd have to be a dumb fuck to think that tulips were a good investment long-term.
Also no one would be willing to buy a very small fraction of a tulip, which would start excluding people who could no longer afford to buy a whole tulip. Bitcoin has none of these problems.
The way I see it, the only way Bitcoin could crash and become worth nothing is if an altcoin comes along that is superior to bitcoin in terms of technology. And it really have to be much superior because bitcoin already has all the attention from of public.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:01:45
I see these huge centralized hubs becoming a thing at first also and it certainly is somewhat a problem since that opens a single point of weakness.
But just think about it. Through Facebook that has a global network of people it's said that through only 5 connections of friends (like a friend's friend's friend's friend's friend) you can reach every person on earth. That is the power of network growth.
In a world where everyone uses the lightning network you would probably only need between 3-5 Lightning channels and from there you could reach every other node in the world.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:40:27
The thing I don't like about lightning is that we have to create kind of a 'ligtning wallet' inside our existing wallet and deposit BTC into that.
It all seems very manual. I hope we will see wallets in the future smart enough to hide all this underlying extra wallet functionality and just use that functionality without having the user do all that stuff manually.

@_date: 2017-12-04 12:48:34
That may be so but Dogecoin has no maximum, it will keep giving 10k dogecoins per block, forever. That's still too inflationary for me. That's in comparison to the Bitcoins reward of 12,5 which will end in no rewards by 2140, and be based on transaction fees from that point on.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:41:33


It does. A promise by the state wouldn't mean anything if the people didn't believe it was worth anything and the price would plummet.
A commodity with finite supply with low demand that suddenly changes to high demand can of course increase in value rapidly. This is a sign of adoption, which is a phase. Not a permanent state even though it might last for many more years.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:55:13
Only because demand of the 'commodity' drive the price up on it. That doesn't make it a hierarchy.
Would you also call people with fiat money the boss over those without a lot of money *for the sole reason that they have more money*? If yes, then our current economy is also one big ponzi scheme and then there's no difference if we go for crypto or fiat anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:13:11
Why would it require more power over time?
Hashing sha256 is the same work in the future as it is now.
Is this some kind of estimation of more bitcoin miners entering the crypto scene to compete for the block rewards?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:50:53
Thank you for the explanation, that makes a lot of sense. Not too self-explanatory though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:42:16
I don't see why we need it "NOW". There's no rush, because there aren't any obvious competitors that have solved the scaling problem (cloest one might be IOTA but I'm still too ignorant to talk about the technology behind it and therefore don't really trust it yet). If such competitors come Bitcoin can implement similar scaling solutions based on those same ideas.

@_date: 2017-12-04 17:40:13


There are enough bitcoin for everybody. Whoever told you otherwise is lying. There's not enough *whole*
 bitcoins for everybody because we are more than 21 million people on this earth. But if the demand for bitcoins increase so will the price of each bitcoin and therefore also the fractions of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:51:27
No, because as he also explains right after, Bitcoin allows people to send almost infinitely divisable bitcoins to a recipient. When the price of Bitcoin go up people will start trading in lower decimals points with each other.
It's not like the USD where $0.01 is the lowest you can go, equal to 1 penny. And it's not just in theory. I could literally send to you 0.00000001 Bitcoin right now if I had your wallet address. And if we needed more than 8 decimal points we could start trading in even smaller.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:38:34
As far as my understanding goes, energy is spent on 2 things: mining new blocks and mining transactions.
A new block is mined by solving puzzle (running the hash function sha256 until the output starts with some amount zeros) with a difficulty of 10 minutes. This only requires 1 computer and that computer will get the reward (12.5 BTC). 
Transactions are similar in that after a certain amount of transactions has been written into the block it will also be mined for a sha256 output. All this is fairly easy to do for a normal computer. But only the fastest gets the transaction fees as rewards.
The energy consumption increase happens because more people enter this competition.
But the good thing is that the more full nodes that are running the more decentralized the whole network also gets, because those running nodes in the network will validate that the mined blocks or transactions do have a sha256 that starts with the required number of zeros.
Which means many nodes are basically trying to hash the same block until one finds the output that it needs. This is where the waste comes in. But there’s nothing to suggest that this should get worse or better over time.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:55:57

You fail to see the problem Bitcoin can solve.
It will provide banking services to the 4-6 billion people of the world outside the reach of normal banking services. 
You can send money across the world instead of having it go through all these bank intermediaries that often takes multiple days before your money arrives, unless you want to pay high transactions fees through something like western union.
On top of all this the government can not inflate Bitcoin like they can with all other currency thereby taking money from peoples savings and pensions.
It's the future of currency and that's why it has value, and it will continue up until that value is found before it will stabilize.

If you get a better understanding of what problems it has the potential of solving and you can see the use for it you might feel safer in determining whether or not you want to put money into it.
I would recommend you watch some of [these videos]( 
Once you are ready to setup a wallet I would suggest you use [Electrum]( If I recall correctly it will guide you through setting up your wallet the first time.

That's because the price of all that stuff went down together with the currency.

Right on the frontpage it describes Bitcoin with:
"Low processing fees"
I don't believe that's entirely true yet.
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:54:03
What the hell are you on about? Even bitcoin.org  - which is basically Satoshi Nakamoto's site - is recommending it. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:54:23
That is what the peasants needs to believe. Otherwise they would lose trust in the currency and the economy of the country would collapse.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:23:31
Yes it could. And it will.

He *is* a developer. And he contributes to Bitcoin core code on github. It's based on consensus of course but he is an active part of that and he has written local segwit implementations for testing on his own machines. So I would think he has a pretty good understanding of all the bitcoin code in general.

*Or*... It will become the future world currency and since there is a limited supply we will never see each bitcoin below $500k again.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:57:26
Funny as hell! Good job.
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:49:19
It only takes one crypto-currency to do something better than bitcoin or have a needed feature that bitcoin doesn't have to make the whole bitcoin economy come tumbling down and "burst the bubble" so to speak.
That being said, I do however think that Bitcoin has a very good chance of becoming the currency of choice in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:17:24
Yes :)
But you are taking this way too seriously.
Quansword's statement can still be considered correct if you think all other currencies (including everything else in the world) declined while Bitcoin stayed the same.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:39:25
Wouldn't it be better to create Electrum wallets directly so they don't have to pay the transaction fees from the bitaddress wallet to Electrum wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:41:00
If you think it's going to 100k soon that means you believe in an increase of 1000% in the future. So put in $100 now and let it become $1000.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:29:20
No, Roger Ver completely twists the words of Satoshi... Saying things like: "The longest blockchain is the real bitcoin" - when in fact it talks about the problems of forking within the same protocol. Otherwise by that reasoning some altcoin is the "real" bitcoin.
and also "the blocksize was not meant to be capped at 1MB" - when in fact it was coded in to be a special cap and only the *utilization* of the 1MB started very low, like 5MB then 10MB out of the 1MB was used, the blocksize itself never changed.
**Utilization of each block** AND **blocksize** are 2 completely different variables that you can tweak and the outcome of changing one or the other is significant.

But the debt is always growing... Once the US is not even able to pay the interest rates that the debt is generating, that's when we hit the point of no return. At that point the government will have only *one* tool they can use.
Initiating hyperinflation of the dollar to get out of debt. It's seen many times before and we will see it again unless something is fundamentally changed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:21:13
Yes, media attention happened.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:03:49
When talking about a currency that's a good thing though. It means people are flocking to it which gives great mouth to mouth PR and brings it closer to mass adoption. When everyone you know are allowed from bankers to take big real estate loans (or loans in general) where it's obvious they won't ever be able to pay it back, then you are dealing with a different kind of bubble.
I'm not saying that bitcoin can't lose value or crash. Simply that people collectively doing a good thing vs. people collectively on a large scale doing a bad thing is quite different to each other.
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:39:44


2 negatives makes a positive!
"The USD is really likely to burst any time soon."
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:08:18


Maybe eventually yes, but that might be too late. 
Bitcoin has slowed down significantly when it comes to implementing new features simply because of the massive amounts of money that is now involved. It was for example a lot easier for Litecoin to implement SegWit2x and Lightning network.
That is something that allows experimental altcoins to innovate and test easier and in doing so have the possibility of overtaking Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:09:31
Sure, I wasn't proclaiming anything to be the truth.
I was simply providing a counterpoint to the people that mentions the bubble multiple times in every bitcoin thread.
And from the upvotes and downvotes it sometimes seems like people are hoping it is a bubble that should crash which also means they hope the wonderful technology that bitcoin provides should not be utilised and that makes me sad because I think this technology can do wonders for the world especially the 4-6 billion people who does not have access to regular banking services.
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:47:13
I think it all comes down to the end result of what Bitcoin will end up being.
If Bitcoin is going to be the digital coin of choice for the general population in the future, it is not a bubble, but if there come some coin that will overtake or outperform Bitcoin a lot of people will lose interest in Bitcoin and see it as overvalued and then abandon it leaving a lot of people to lose a lot of money.
But I think there's a good chance that Bitcoin will be the future currency of choice for a big chunk of the worlds population and since Bitcoin has a limited supply I believe the value is there, and if it turns out to be the case I also believe that Bitcoins are undervalued as it is right now.

A Central bank doesn't control it's inflation and no one can stop a transaction between 2 parties.
Those things are enough to make it highly valuable.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:11:18
I can't pay through my bank because my money is stored as DKK (or Kroner), so I have to do visa transfer which means for a value of $150 it cost me about $4 in transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:42:20
Yes it won't be good for currency before the price stabilizes.
Once it has found its price amd stayed at that same price for a long time people will begin to use it as currency again.

I own 3.8% of a bitcoin, hoorah!

@_date: 2017-11-19 22:28:12
Ask stupid questions, get stupid answers. 
No one knows if it will go up or down in the future, but timing the market is generally perceived as an impossible task unless you have inside knowledge about the company you invest in.
Most people follow the "Do I want this asset? And do I believe in this asset long term?" and if you can answer yes to those it's probably a good idea to invest now. Waiting doesn't make sense when you don't know the future.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:22:18
Well... If you kept 6250 Bitcoins (25%) you are worth $50M today, so I think you are still doing ok.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:02:58
Yes increasing those 700 USD since then really took some time, but at least we arrived eventually.

Why would you buy a whole bitcoin?

Only if we ever see it below 10k again. If not they are not really "smart investors"
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:52:00
Absolutely. not necessarly bitcoin but crypto-currency. And I think Bitcoin has the biggest chance of becoming that now.
I would recommend for anyone to look at some of [Andreas Antonopulous' videos]( where he speaks of Bitcoin. It is very inspiring and motivating.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:56:21
Short it then.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:15:11
The core principle of fiat currecy is that you can control the supply. No way of doing that with Bitcoin without changing the absolute fundamentals which would be such a radical change that it would be classified as a new currency.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:49:47
I would say that is the least important one. Making sure pay all there income taxes seems like a way bigger issue.

@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:38
So you basically got it cheap and just before a large influx of money from the general population joins in you wanna sell?
Think that logic through for a moment please.
When everyone and their mother is allowed - by bankers - to take loans which they can't possibly pay back that will obviously crash the banks because all the capital will never be paid back.
When everyone and their mother suddenly want a commodity/currency in very limited supply then the price will obviously go up on that commodity.
Only when everyone or a large majority loses faith in it and withdraws their money, can it crash.

Tommy didn't deserve this. He is not unreasonable. Neither is paypal, they're a private company who can stop dealing with anyone they like, but it just goes to show the need for a independent and neutral money system. The leftists who hates individualism cannot stand the thought of not having control over everyones transactions. It's truly scary.
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:57:55
No they won't just spend as necessity, I don't buy your premise. You underestimate how much people actually want stuff, especially when they can afford it now. Gold was a currency once and despite it having deflationary properties in certain periods it didn't stop people from spending. 
When people know their government is maintaining a slow deflationary currency of 2% year, - for the rest of your lifetime - like we pretty much have with inflation now, do you think people will postpone living and spending for all eternity? Of course they won't. 
People who starts a new family will still want a house or apartment now if they have the ability to afford it. It's not useful 15 years from now when their kids are grown up. Similar with all other spending in society. If people already can afford it, even if it means loss of future profits, people are willing to spend it now. 
Why else do you also see people buy stuff with their money now instead of investing it in an Index funds that grow with approx. 10%/year? Because they would rather have stuff now than let their money grow in the fund.

You can, but only adressing a person's character is the argument of ad hominem, most often because someone doesn't want to deal with the actual substance of the argument itself. It's a weak move if it's the only thing you do.

Not the question I asked but ok.
When he was leader he didn’t advocate hate. He advocated strict immigration laws and intolerance against criminals. He left because too many members didn’t share his views. So why does PayPal ban him? Because just being anti immigration is now pretty much seen as hate speech.
