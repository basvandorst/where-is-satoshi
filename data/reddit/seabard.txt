No. 62k average viewers for WCS global final season3, wtf is wrong with SC2 fans. Stop pulling statistics out of your ass.

9? Please stop... you're embarrassing yourself.. Even WCS season 3 global final had 63k average viewers with 80k peak viewership...
WCS season 2 final and WCS season 2 EU final are the only ones that could have gotten 100k peak viewers...and none of them had gotten close to 100k average viewership...

100k viewers for SC2? We're not in 2011~2012 anymore.
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:29:15
SC2 rarely breaks 100k anymore, big tournaments getting around 50~60k while smaller ones having 10~20k viewers....DH might be able to get close to 100k, but that is about it...

Threatened? No I am just pointing out the fact that people are going as far as lying to promote their game... it is just shameful

SERIOUSLY STOP FUCKING PULLING STATS OUT OF YOUR ASS
72k viewer avearge event is not 100k event... sigh. Not to mention that you only brought up a 72k viewer event instead of 9 100k events...
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:20:59
The fact that most of them were around 50k~60k marks makes your statement incredibly misleading.....If you have no idea what you did wrong with that statement, I seriously worry for your life man... You can't be THAT STUPID. It would be like LoL players saying their weekly LCS gets ~500k viewers when it gets around 200~300k usually.

There weren't 9 SC2 100k tournaments in 2013.....That is what I have been saying all this time.....sigh
@_date: 2014-03-12 13:15:33


9 SC2 Tournaments with 100k? LOL go and look up viewer stats for events in 2013.

There weren't 9 SC2 tournaments that were close to 100k mark in 2013....This is what I pointed out from beginning of the discussion....sigh
