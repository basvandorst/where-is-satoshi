Exchanges do have a very important role. They are to exchange coins, not store them. Only keep a small amount, if any, on an exchange. They are a huge target with great returns to the attacker. Also you could be easily socially engineered to revealing or giving access to your account. Do not say it can't happen to you. Everyone who is socially engineered says the same thing. 
But yes, use 2fa but the 2fa must be on a completely different device that what you are using to access the exchange. Also no SMS for 2fa. Think about creating a different telephone number, google voice or Sudo app, that is unknown to everyone. Give that phone number to the exchange if they need one. 
If you need liquid money, use a hot wallet on your phone. Only keep as much in the hot wallet and exchange that you are comfortable with loosing. 
For any crypto that would hurt loosing, put it in a cold wallet; trezor, ledger or paper wallet.

There are many that do dispense cash as well. The issue is when getting cash you need to wait for the transaction to be fully confirmed.

The amount of coin you buy is irrelevant. 
True, normally you don't spend $1 million to protect $100 worth of something. But, feeling confident and able to sleep well also needs to be taken into consideration. Also, what ever you spent on the coins, you had to earn through hard work.
Another thing to consider is, if your keys get out there, the attacker doesn't have to take you coins right away. They can monitor the address and when there is a "substantial" amount in there, that's when they take your coins. It could be tomorrow or next year.
And on top of that, use this time, while using small amounts, to become a trezor ninja. Then you can be the go-to for cold storage/off line storage for friends.
So I think you have already answered your question. I hopefully confirmed your thoughts.
The only down side is if the $100 will break your bank and not be able to pay bills or put food on the table.
Don't discount paper wallets.
--edit-- added paper wallets comment.
