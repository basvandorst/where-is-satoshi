Were they his coins? weren't they silk road coins? I just mean they are directly tied to a definitely(?) illegal operation. Whether DPR is convicted of what he is charged is a different issue legally.

To be fair, HDMI wasn't really designed to work longer than around 15ft. If it works at 50ft it might be worth it to some strange person who insists on using HDMI rather than a professional cable for that kind of range.

he just means that for example on the front page Dell tweeted that it got a 85 ($50000) bitcoin order. Dell in all likelihood is just selling those coins immediately on an exchange, to get USD. 
Because More and more businesses are starting to accept bitcoin, but none of them can use them with other venders, those coins are being turned around immediately and sold, creating a high volume of coins available to buy on the market, driving the price down, or at the very least creating this negative pressure he is talking about.
Once businesses can keep the whole transaction loop bitcoin it would relieve some of this negative pressure, but the fact that the price is staying stable shows that demand is keeping up with the rate of sale.

i didn't say that it makes bitcoin worthless, but it cuts bitcoin out of a major, important and essential future for digital currencies.

You do realize that bitcoin is still barely used? Fees will just naturally make it less efficient for the user as a way of sending money. 
When you can use bitcoin with the same number of merchants as paypal, then fees start to be less of an issue for users.
You gotta have the utility first before you start charging for it.

Maybe you have put some market research into this, but it seems like most of the bitcoin market at this point isn't going to be interested in pointless crap (a decorative grim reaper seems like something I would find at a crazy aunts house)

Yeah, I think cheating will be rampant in any game like this. Doing aimbot with knives was always problem (speed hack).

Jesus, $4 on $20, that is no joke. Is it a percentage or just a flat fee?

I think they problem you are trying to solve (people throwing out upvotes to anything) will be offset by users doing any thing they can get to get upvotes (as they make money). The is just Karma on steroids. Maybe I am wrong, but I feel like there is a potential for even more cute cat videos than ever.

this is an important element to the bitcoin economy, people have to be paid in bit coins in order to have the interest in spending them.
@_date: 2012-06-15 20:30:19
no, a speed hack manipulates the server to allow your client to move faster than the game naturally allows. So you run fast, you can shoot (or stab) with no cool down time, all that jazz. Any one who has played an FPS for any amount of time knows there are many other types of cheats than just aim-bot.
I don't know any thing about making hacks, but the fact that the game is open source and people can make money for frags guarantees that the hackers will come running.
I mean they do it for hell of it, why wouldn't they do it for money.

so you only have to rebackup a wallet when you send coins from it? I thought I read you need to back it up after every transaction.
I am not really concerned with this too much, since at this point I don't have tonnes of bitcoins, but is there any secure way to load a wallet besides just being sure you are on a secure network and don't have a trojan loaded on your computer?
@_date: 2011-05-30 20:37:43

it seems that ntp isn't natively on knoppix? idk I did some googling, and tried some of the commands given, but haven't been able to install it. 
I am sure that it isn't really that hard, but I am pretty unfamiliar with linux right now, and installing the generic ntp package seems like it is over my head right now, not to mention, having to do it every time I load up the linux live CD seems like a lot of work is starting to pile up (installing bitcoin, true crypt, and an ntp system every time I want to withdraw from my savings?). 
Does any one know versions of linux (for live cd) that this wouldn't be a problem?
Again, I don't really know any thing about linux, I don't doubt my abilities to figure it out, it just takes a lot of time which I don't feel like investing in at the moment.
@_date: 2011-04-28 16:24:35

Except most states tax barter as well on large ticket items.

Definitely a interesting concept, although bit coins have very little to do with it. Honestly I think that exploring the economics of a situation like this without exploring the social aspects is pointless. I had a hard time relating to some of the examples because they seemed so ridiculous. The desire for status comes from the ability to have leverage, so any kind of status would be entirely imagined, and I think would very quickly dissolve.
@_date: 2011-06-18 16:32:32
yeah, it took me a while to figure out how to actually buy some, so when I finally figured out that there was that easy paypal site it was already $2.00 a coin. The next day pay pal revoked that guys ability to do that. (I don't think dwolla was set up with mt. gox yet, and it took days and real money for it to be worth it)

yeah, I feel like usability of bitcoins is  something that can hold it back right now.  It isn't intuitive, it's not like it is super hard to figure out, but if you don't have someone showing you, you have to do research to fully understand it. Definitely an intuitive bitcoin client would go a long way to help push it forward.

Well, some sites price in USD, and then take an average of the daily market value for the price in bitcoins, based on the USD price. I would say that is a good solution for the moment, while bitcoins fluctuate so much.

Not really,  thats the value of having a whole spectrum of blockchains.  In there will be many chains. Bitcoin will wake up to this, probably. Either way it doesn't really matter, this tech isn't going away.

psychologically that sentence gets people thinking whether or not bitcoin is destined to become a global currency, even if it points to the negative, it creates the idea of the positive at the same time, so really it isn't a bad thing. 
(no such thing as bad publicity)

at the same time if we create systems which make it impossible  for the government to work this way (like bitcoin for example!) then you don't have to go through the trouble of whether its google's fault or the governments.  Moving to P2P applications in all areas of our digital lives will be to everyones benefit if we are interested in individuality the way we think of it now.

I am not interested in controlling populations, I am saying that is how populations will be controlled **from** understanding bitcoins. 
It will be used to *literally give* people the thought of "bitcoin as magic" And it i can unfold that it is all a game, just something some people do on the side for fun. 
This ad works through its **repulsiveness**. People look at it, and say "What the fuck is that? Oh, its some kids screwing around". 
It works for us cause we find creativity in its shittyness, but that is something that is pretty reserved for a particular part of our generation. 
So again, in a motion to persuade nerds to come join our party, we are simultaneously creating ammunition to be used against us.
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:11:06
Ok, I don't disagree with you... In fact I also wonder how any ad is good for bitcoin. Right now we are selling it as magic and I see that is only good for a laugh for those who are on the inside. I also see it as potentially bad to represent bitcoin that way.

I get that, I think we should use playful ads.
Just seems important that as something becomes a portal to undersanding bitcoins, it's own power can be just as easily be pointed at a different audience by like say, a corprate news giant.

Bam - Dad does a google search on bitcoin magic money.  and reads "Bitcoin, magic money and boners, Haha, look how shitty it is

 Magic is also word used as something that people don't understand. And the truth is this currency planted in our laps by an anonymous symbol and has made plenty of people who don't understand it fully lots of money, just check out the troll box on one of the exchanges. 
I am not a hater, I am not worried of people feeling tricked, I am trying to minimize the ammo for those who are threatened by something like bitcoin.

what kind of performance in terms of cold storage is really necessary? It doesn't ever have to enter the blockchain, I don't see what type of processing would be required of it.
That being asked, doesn't look like a bad direction.
