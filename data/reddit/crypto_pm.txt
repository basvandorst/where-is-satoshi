We've just launched this service as a part of the Cryptography LTD portofolio (  is our primary service ), and it's the 2nd of the 4 that we currently have planned.
We'd love to hear your feedback on this.

This has nothing necessarily to do with legality. The issue with a number of UK based exchanges in the past is a lack of authorization from the FCA, and poor AML/KYC checks in tandem with that.
We've been in talks with the FCA for some time, and have engaged a number of banks on a corporate level - and we've had a lot of movement. They have not tried to actively block us at any point.
There are two sides to every story, please don't assume that the exchange is an innocent victim that has acted perfect in every way. Without FCA authorization and solid AML/KYC checks (to UK standards), any exchange setting up shop in the UK is doomed to failed.
Let's not forget, the banks also reserve the right to refuse to do business with a customer for WHATEVER REASON THEY DEEM FIT.
I'm a lawyer with a team of people setting up a UK based exchange.

A secure and stable self-scaling platform with attractive fees (0.18% flat rate) and an expansive feature set.

Doh! I'll get this looked in to, thanks for bringing it to my attention.

One of the team is personally registered with OTC, but truth be told - we didn't even consider an entity registration. We'll take care of this within the next day.

We're a UK incorporated company and as a result, our details are public. If we run away with anything, you would be free to set the bloodhounds on us.
At the end of the day, we stand to make far more money on our other ventures - and on top of our cryptocurrency exchange, we are currently trying to bring an instant BTC POS system to the UK to enable vendors to accept BTC in person in such a simplistic fashion.
To be honest, trust takes time to build - and we're hoping we can take care of that.
