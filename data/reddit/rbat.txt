Hi, I'm Rodrigo Batista, CEO of MercadoBitcoin.net, one of the companies that worked in the project.
Basically, it consisted of the following implementations:
* The app installed in the phones was indeed a simple wallet implementation
* The app worked only for people at the event (Campus Party) based on the phone location, that was sent to servers
* The phones also sent the btc address to servers
Also, there was some good UI/UX implementations in the app:
* During the rain, the app had an animation of a boy suggesting people to raise their arms (that animation was fired every time the cellphone was in horizontal position)
* After raising the arm the animation was changed to a coin dropping inside the mobile (that animation was fired every time the cellphone was in vertical position)
Finally, the event sound and illumination were setup to simulate a storm, using thunder sounds and lightning.

Hi, I´m the CEO of MercadoBitcoin.com.br
Campus Party is one of the biggest Tech events in the world and we will use the Lamassu machine to spread the news about Bitcoin in Brazil. 160,000 are expected to be there this year.
Bitcoin is still very new in Brazil, even for tech guys. Virtual currencies here don´t get big media coverage that they do in US and Europe. We are trying to change that.
After the event we will have a permanent installation at some of the financial districts in Sao Paulo. It is being hard to find a place to do it. The Businesses we have approached think it is dangerous to have an unattended machine that stores money at their locations. But we will solve that for sure.

Today, Dell branch in Brazil does not take Bitcoins. It seems they are thinking about it!!!

Kryptomena, you can buy one issue of the Super Interessante Magazine called "Why is everything so Expensive in Brazil?" and pay it with using Bitcoin:  
We, MercadoBitcoin.com.br, created the paywall for them.

I run the Brazilian exchange MercadoBitcoin.com.br. This rules are exactly what we say to our clients when they ask us about taxation. No surprises.

Hi, I'm Rodrigo Batista, ceo of the Brazilian exchange MercadoBitcoin.net
My understanding is that this project was created at a hackathon sponsored by Intel in Brazil in order to spread the "Intel IoT Developer Kit", their internet of things development framework.
The project is a prototype for a multi-product vending machine that takes Bitcoin as payment method and releases the product that was previously selected from a menu. It was created using Arduino and node.js.

Hi, my name is Rodrigo Batista and I run MercadoBitcoin.com.br since May/2013 after we bought the company. Before that, I worked as developer for the Brazilian Exchange and was an eletronic trading specialist for Morgan Stanley in Brazil and NY.
I just want to clarify the controversies about us here (I've post a similar message in other thread last year):
Mercado Bitcoin is the first Bitcoin exchange created in Brazil, in 2011, and it is one of the oldest in the world. I’m glad we are the biggest Bitcoin company in Latin America and also one of the top 20 exchanges in Bitcoincharts.
The site was indeed compromised in March/2013. Those were crazy days and it happened to many exchanges around the world. After the incident, myself and a friend invested in the website because we were already big enthusiasts of Bitcoin and the website had a good brand, a good number of clients and we could buy it cheaper than writing one from scratch.
After taking control of the company, we paid every client of the site down to the last penny. The money flew from our personal cash account directly to the clients that had any lost. The last payment was done on July 25th and almost all the users that had bitcoins with us at the time are still active clients. Some of them are huge clients now.
After the security breach we hired a security audit company  that did a great job. Today we have some other security audits. We have implemented other security measures such as EV SSL, a better cold wallet, client limits and we are improving our security every single day.
We are doing our best to make Bitcoin Brazilian market more mature and I do think we are being very successful. Initiatives like creating the first micropayment gateway for the biggest magazzines publisher in South America ( or bring the first Lamassu unit to Latin America are some of those initiatives (
However, in Brazil there is a commercial fight going on, and some of the competitors are struggling to live. Some guys have hired some slut girls, like this , to chase us wherever we go... 
We keep doing our job and we will have a lot to show to Bitcoin community in the next months.
We are very, very, proud of the work we have been doing and surely it is helping to put Brazil in the Bitcoin map!
Thanks for all the Brazilians that trust and support what we are doing.

It will be at Anhembi, in the north side of the city!

Next week, we will use it in one of the biggest tech events in the world:

Brazilian government requires people to pay taxes on Bitcoin gains only if total sales of Bitcoins in 2013 totals more than 35,000 Real (around, 15,500 dollars). 
So my view is that it really does not affect people that don’t trade a lot or people using it as payment for daily activities.
At the end I think it is very good news, because people here are still scared  to jump in the Bitcoin boat because of lack of specific virtual currency regulations.
Also, people that want to use it as an investment now have a clear guidance to pay their taxes, that is very similar to the way they already do for other assets and investments such as stocks and houses.

They wont regulate it by now, but they say they are paying attention on the matter. Also, warn about the risks and so on...

They were hired because they are really hard workers. Fortunately we had their beaty as a bonus.

Agree that smart contract would be the solution here. However, as far as I know, that would require a third party to judge who is right here. Who would be that person?

How MULTI-SIG works in this context? who would sign the transactions?

They are picking Ethereum, instead of Bitcoin. This is the reason in their paper:
"It is important to note that while BitCoin contains an escalating difficulty in the mining process to restrict the issuance of currency, no such restriction is necessary in our vision of the world. We need sufficient Proof of Stake and Proof of Work to ensure network integrity and cryptographic security but without the need to impose an arbitrarily increasing computation cost and carbon footprint on the process."
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:57:12
* "The key to this will be mobile phones. Already, in the developing countries with the right regulatory framework, people are storing money digitally on their phones and using their phones to make purchases, as if they were debit cards. By 2030, 2 billion people who don't have a bank account today will be storing money and making payment with their phones. And by then, mobile money providers will be offering the full range of financial services, from interest-bearing savings accounts to credit to insurance."
Great summary!!!

I run MercadoBitcoin.net, the Brazilian bitcoin exchange. We have seen an explosion in our user base and volumes in the last 6 months. Today we have almost 120,000 registered clients and the rate of new users registering daily is outstanding. The main reason is that we face very serious political and economic crises. In addition, the government has increased taxes on remmitances and is improving capital controls.
People are finally realizing that technology provides them many ways to set themselves free.

My name is Rodrigo Batista and I run MercadoBitcoin.com.br since May.
This is the first time I use Reddit to communicate and I just want just to clarify the controversies about us here (please ignore my English mistakes):
Mercado Bitcoin is the first Bitcoin exchange created in Brazil, in 2011, and it is one of the oldest in the world. I’m glad we are the biggest Bitcoin company in Latin America and also one of the top 25 Exchanges in Bitcoin Charts. 
Our website was indeed compromised in March in the same time that it happened with many exchanges around the world that time. After the hack I some friends invested in the webite because I do believe in Bitcoins and I had satisfactory explanations from site creator.
I and my partners have paid every client of the site to down to the last penny. The money flew from my personal cash account directly to the clients that had any lost. The last payment was done on July 25th and almost all the users that had bitcoins with us at the time are still active clients. If someone client say that we did no pay, please just give me the user name and I can send all the receipts.
After the security breach we hired a security audit company  and they have been working with us since May.  We have implemented other security measures such as EV SSL, a better cold wallet, client limits and we are improving our security every day.
We are doing our best to make bitcoin Brazilian market more mature and I do think we are being very successful. Initiatives like the doodle we launched last week  are putting Brazil in the Bitcoin map.
However, in Brazil there is a commercial fight going on, and some of the competitors are struggling to live. My only recommendation to them is start doing a good job for yourself and for Bitcoin community in Brazil, instead of trying to harm every initiative Mercado Bitcoin is doing.
We are very, very, happy to have one of the biggest communications company in the world trying bitcoins. It is time to celebrate!!!

We created this simple table just to compare Bitcoin to some American payment processing companies. Do you think this is a good way of evaluating Bitcoin?
