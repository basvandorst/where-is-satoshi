I have a guide on how to make BIP39 segwit addresses in electrum so that way older wallets/exchanges can still send to a segwit, including Coinbase.

Electrum makes bc1 segwit addresses which aren’t backwards compatible but I made a guide on how to make BIP39 addresses which are backwards compatible

I made a guide here on how to make a BIP39 segwit wallet address in Electrum (since it won’t let you generate BIP39 seeds on your own). This is handy for sending bitcoin out of exchanges that haven’t deployed segwit wallets (like Coinbase), since they won’t recognize the segwit addresses electrum generates by default:

Unfortunately you can’t avoid a segwit transaction. A lot of people were asking about this online and the overwhelming consensus was that they’re structured totally differently, so it’s not possible to convert one wallet to another.

Completely agree. It’s a cumbersome workaround anyways

Here’s a YouTube video I made a few days ago that follows the same steps

I created a guide for getting around this problem:

Use this guide I made and you can get backwards compatible segwit addresses in electrum. The bc1 addresses electrum makes aren’t good for the older wallets like Coinbase

I created a guide on how to make BIP39 backwards compatible SegWit addresses in Electrum, since their Segwit implementations will give you addresses that won't work for exchanges with older wallets, like Coinbase.

Edge works extremely well, is open source and supports segwit as well as a bunch of other cryptos like eth and xmr

Honestly I think Edge wallet is one of the best alternatives and is completely open source and dual platform.
