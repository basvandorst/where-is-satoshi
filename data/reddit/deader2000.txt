Then it's not a very wise state and it deserves it
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:41:32
That's also what i believe considering past experience. While january is usually bearish, ferbruary will bring a new Bull run. Considering all the good news this might happen

@_date: 2018-01-06 07:24:19
This guy is living, and just spreading fee fud. He just said earlier he mined btc with 1 videocard.

There's a limit to the bitcoins a group can sell... as they are beeing eaten up by buyers, their sale power is getting diminished. That was one of the points of a limited supply after all
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:38:08
I own one of them :)
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:11:47

10 years later...
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:00:14
i hope it dips or stays the same for another 18 hours till my funds arrive in the exchange wallet :))
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:38:23
Our advantage is that our internet started later than yours and they implemented fiber optics from the beginning, so when gb connections were available the infrastructure was already in place
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:55:57
Move to Romania. The irs bere just stated in a lawsuit that there is no las reglementing bitcoin and they can not tax transactions done with IT or any gains
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:47:34
A friend of mine and I gathered a group of good people and we gather funds and buy presents for poor children for Christmas in our county in Romania.  We already delivered to one school last week. Doing more would be nice
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:05:26
What's up with the price for the last 12 hours... have been waiting for a dip to get 1 btc and it keeps staying at the same price... at least it should grow and help me make my mind already... this is driving me insane
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:33:42
Unfortunately I don't have that amount on my credit card left :)) And the romanian exchange doesn't work with credit card just wallet credit or bank transfer(that takes as long as the transfer to wallet and I already initiated that one friday)
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:24:04
4th time i se this post this week

@_date: 2017-12-14 16:13:21
One can only hope right now :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:07:53
They might be trying to screw the long betters :)) Just like the short ones were on open days

@_date: 2017-12-10 14:10:41
I moved 14k Euros to the echange wallet on friday but my bank has a stupid policy that states that all amounts over 10k euro after 15:00 will be delivered on Monday... it's nerve recking
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:59:09
You can get in, I want out :))
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:11:55
Because spreading fud is what he does
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:06:44
No crash, people are not as scared about the futures after last week. If trend continues, futures launch will come with a price boom
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:20:51
Talking just for Romania, we won't do anything till Monday morning because even our exchange is closed till then and doesn't accept deposits :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:45:04
Me too since I'll get my funds 8 hours after the launch
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:04:29

@_date: 2017-12-17 11:23:57
Yep, especially when I wanted to buy when it was 5k and I had to wait for approvals from my bank and when everything was done it was 15k
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:14:42
Also Romanian exchanges are in the same situation... have been trying to get a price to buy 1 btc and I can only do 0.99 at this price...
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:35:11
My prediction was at the start of this week that a dip will start before the market opens and then a huge push to 20k USD because big increase in demand. Guess what happened in the last few days.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:31:08
:)) What do you see you were right... 19500 USD right now with already 2 pushes made for the 20k wall
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:42:11
Romania :)) and it's only about 12usd / month
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:39:35
It's parent, which predicts over years was pretty correct... But you're right... i can buy 0.01 anytime
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:12:32
Fees go to the miners that mine bitcoin and confirm your transactions
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:38:16
What is this bitcoincash you are talking about?
@_date: 2018-09-07 07:15:02

According to this it will drop on the next 2 days before it rises forever...

@_date: 2018-10-17 06:03:19
Dude change your dealer :)) the stuff is rotten. Also your chart is shit first because it's on linear and second becaus your top line touches nothing and the second one is arbitrarily put there... I could as well draw it near the 19800 top and it would mean the exact opposite thing... You stupid trolling bitch
@_date: 2018-10-04 09:00:39

It's a scam coin coordinated by a handful of chinese miners and promoted by the convicted felon Roger Ver. Their agenda is to promote their scam to the extent of replacing bitcoin and controlling the market price. For this, they are falsely advertising bitcoin cash as bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-28 05:03:00
If You are using bitcoin.com you are most likely buying bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin without knowing it
@_date: 2018-06-28 05:08:03
Also there is no bitcoin core. Bitcoin core is a lie invented by Roger Ver to justify the replacement of bitcoin with bitcoin cash. The official bitcoin website is bitcoin.org not bitcoin.com
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:45:56

Ok then post a link to that research you found leading to your supposition
@_date: 2018-11-02 07:48:33
Again? Didn't they already do that last year? :))
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:30:19
It dropped $2000 USD in the last 3 days
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:32:46
I read your first line too.
. It says "As per research"
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:23:12
So when can we see your research?
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:17:54
Counting active addresses is stupid. Between me and my friends there are about 20 addresses with balance that became inactive when the market crashed almost 1 year ago
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:28:15
It just dropped $100

BCH has 0 scalling. BCH is a scam
