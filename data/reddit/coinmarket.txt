Coindesk themself posted about it, Alan released this info in the first place, they didn't want people to know so they deleted the info, a lot of people know about this and a lot that did not got to see the deleted post from coindesk it self don't know about this.
Also Barry confirmed that he bid more than Market price.
@_date: 2014-09-27 04:44:33
I called PayPal and they opened a charge back and they filed a Fraud Complaint on him.
He has 3 different Paypal account with different name all from same IP.
I will call his parent.
@_date: 2014-07-03 19:41:57
You can buy them from me.
I have enough.
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:43:19
Didn't Barry confirmed that his bad was higher than market price on his twitter? Im pretty sure I saw it somewhere. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:30:49
I bought few games with bitcoin when Microsoft started to accept it as payment method &lt;3
From  &lt;3
@_date: 2014-11-15 04:17:17
I paid the exact amount it asked me, but a small amount was taking out because of transaction fee. I think 0.001 was taking out.
Does that mean I have to count transaction fee as well?? So I have to send the amount they ask + 0.001 ??
@_date: 2014-09-02 01:50:03
I rather convert fiat to BTC.
@_date: 2014-09-11 01:24:50
Can you link me one?
Cant seem to find any that the btc logo is not obvious...
@_date: 2014-07-08 09:02:24
That seems good for me.
How do we do this trade?
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:02:14
Anyone know how much Canadian BTC ATM fees are?
That would be a better option for me than online.
@_date: 2014-07-06 23:31:37
Sorry my fault again.
I fixed it fast enough.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:26:59
I can only buy with my bank.
I never use debit card or visa card.
@_date: 2014-07-08 08:58:23
can only buy 100-200DRK
tell me how much for them?
@_date: 2014-11-15 06:27:05
You are wrong.
I will take the most obvious example. 
When you Pay with PayPal to an online merchant, you do not pay any extra because of PayPal fees, you pay the exact amount you see on there website, anyway you cannot change the amount since its all automated with Paypal API, you just Login with your PayPal account and confirm payment.
At the end the merchant PayPal will receive a bit less because of the fee. That is how it always worked.
@_date: 2014-07-08 08:51:20
I can buy some of them.
@_date: 2014-11-15 03:40:32
Yes a refund....
Do not assume anything before knowing how they proceed and call me a liar.
Check the pic by yourself FacePalm.
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:30:03
Coindesk deleted the post.
Alan released this info about Barry Silbert bid. So my guess is that Barry did not want people to know so they deleted it. Even the tweet got deleted, the reddit post did as well.
@_date: 2014-10-20 08:48:24
Just buy under $300 and youll make profit, 100% sure.
@_date: 2014-08-27 01:47:09
I saw someplace its 3-5%, does that make sense?
Anyone ever used BTC ATM?
@_date: 2014-08-27 01:54:01
Where can I see all the ATMs Location in Canada?
@_date: 2014-10-21 07:37:24
What you mean ?
@_date: 2014-09-27 05:52:30
I am not sure, but very possible.
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:20:38
They told me via support that their newegg.ca site should accept BTC today.
@_date: 2014-09-11 04:06:33
Well my bot found all of them thanks.
@_date: 2014-11-15 02:04:43
Transaction are "instant" but confirmations takes hours for me. 
And Newegg has to receive the payment with 3 or 6 confirmation to be set as Paid under 15 mins.
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:45:45
Its called helping the community. I wasnt doing the hosting for myself but to help the coin.
And you are stupid, I was asking for advanced back end security, not how to host.
I have 10 years experience in hosting.
@_date: 2014-09-23 21:23:33
Nothing exiting about this.
Paypal is not accepting Bitcoin they are just adding other Payment processor to there hub.
@_date: 2014-08-27 01:23:14
I need to buy BTC. Anyone want to sell me 1 btc please?
I need to buy something on newegg:(
@_date: 2014-09-12 01:00:12
It found 12,78 BTC worth.
@_date: 2014-09-06 21:16:18
Newegg really?
Never buying anything from newegg ever again.
I will hold my Bitcoin and spend only 10% of it.
@_date: 2014-09-12 01:10:25
Dont worry, I will be giving half back to the community.
@_date: 2014-07-14 20:39:02
This is the best innovative coin I have ever seen.
@_date: 2014-09-11 00:28:34
Wow really?
What other background should I use then I have no idea :(
@_date: 2014-09-22 04:12:33
You probably did it and took your son as a Mascot.
Not cool.
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:18:06
Barry Silbert bid was $665, that is an average of all his bids and GOT OUTBID.
@_date: 2014-12-28 23:08:28
I am watching you right now ;)
@_date: 2014-09-02 04:50:41
Woooow really?
@_date: 2014-07-01 07:34:25
WOW NEWEGG FOR CANADA DONT ACCEPT BITCOIN WTF?
@_date: 2014-08-27 03:31:09
wow thats wayy too high man :(
@_date: 2014-09-02 01:29:51
I have 0 btc...
@_date: 2014-10-21 23:57:41
I can help you but I need payment first.
@_date: 2014-11-15 04:08:49
I have no idea how there stuff works. They told me Newegg would basically tell Bitpay to proceed the refund. And they also told me that if I contact Bitpay, Bitpay would have to have the OK from Newegg to proceed the refund.
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:28:57
You just missed the info, do not say bullshit.
I was wake up all night so I saw everything that happened.
@_date: 2014-09-21 07:13:52
It is real TA.
@_date: 2014-11-15 03:07:23
Newegg says they cant do anything but process a refund that will take up 5-7 business days.
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:36:28
My transactions always take hours to get 3 confirmations.
Being said, Bitcoin will need to speed up the process because this is ridiculous and wont work long term.
@_date: 2014-07-02 06:13:43
Im 14% of that.
@_date: 2014-08-27 22:49:58
Well you deserve to get account froze lol... You sold something and accepted payment as a gift.
What do you expect honestly? Making this thread is pathetic.
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:38:28
I am dumping my 2k BTC 
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:42:30
yeah that one and it was also posted on coindesk too.
@_date: 2014-09-26 05:13:25
They wont accept it until 2015.
Its a fact.
@_date: 2015-05-02 05:36:10
In bitcoin we trust friend!
Lets all share tips for our lovely community!
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:13:27
Barry Silbert was $665 and got outbid.
What is your conclusion on that ?
@_date: 2014-07-08 09:09:13
send me one :)?
@_date: 2014-08-27 01:34:22
How does BTC ATM works, how much fee do you pay?
@_date: 2014-08-23 05:10:42
Does not really matter if company accept BTC. They also have to hold it. If they sell it, it just push the price down mid-long term.
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:38:01
It depends what website, what wallet you use. and other factors. You should stop calling people a troll because of your lack of knowledge. This is very degrading.
@_date: 2014-09-21 07:19:46
You should probably learn before. Its extremely complex. Tell me what you can understand from my TA, it will be a start.
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:21:16
New people die, new people suffer. So please pay the fee.
@_date: 2014-07-01 07:28:29
You guys are able to buy stuff with BTC right now? I dont seem to see the option.
It is worldwide?
@_date: 2014-11-15 06:54:34
Yeah I guess, well I sent them my btc address for them to "refund" me my money. 
I dont understand why they just cant generate a new invoice, this is just wasting my time, or simply let me pay the extra 0.001... Like 7 days to perform a refund, like is this real life? We are in 2014...
@_date: 2015-05-05 23:45:12
hello friend :P
@_date: 2014-11-15 06:20:29
and what about transaction fee ? Do I have to count that in and pay extra so that newegg receive the exact amount ?
@_date: 2014-10-02 06:44:56
What about Canada? What is going on Coinbase you random.

I need something secure, fast, stable.
@_date: 2015-08-20 05:33:19
whats XT?
@_date: 2015-07-07 04:02:49
 Yes multiple times. Its been 1 week + now.
@_date: 2015-07-04 22:18:57
do you know if there ticket support is 24/7 ?
@_date: 2015-07-04 21:28:53
No I am not...cavirtex is a Canadian exchange only.
@_date: 2015-07-05 06:55:08
I did that and still didn't work.
and I e-mailed them, but they apparently don't have weekend e-mail support which is retarded.
@_date: 2015-07-06 23:21:45
After waiting for 5 days, I finally received an e-mail from support. They said they have enabled bitcoin withdrawals on my account.
Guess what? I try to withdraw and get the same error: Bitcoin Withdrawals are Temporarily Disabled
@_date: 2015-04-12 17:28:16
They never scammed anyone.
Prove otherwise.
@_date: 2015-04-12 17:16:53
What does that even mean. Cavirtex always been the most trusted exchange in the world.
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:46:29
Did you use them recently? Can you deposit and withdraw with no problem now that they re-opened?
