They will keep this going for as long as possible sucking as much money as possible until they have enough to make a run for it. I already got my refund months ago.. just before they offered super shipping for an extra 100$ to me its obvious that this is a scam. We need to eliminate BFL from bitcoin.

This business is run by a convicted fraudster's relative. It's a hard pill for you to swallow when you have money tied up with them. No one would ever admit to being a victim of a ponzi scheme, it's embarrassing and judging by how defensive you are I would say you are scared. I know because I had money tied up with them and managed to get a refund when they started charging 100$ for faster shipping I knew they were bullshit. And now you can preorder  a graphics asic card... yea right.. keep the bullshit coming

without that special number the adoption and transition to bitcoin would be too slow. My number bought me in and hopefully by the time we reach our numbers BTC will be more useful than USD
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:35:03
Seen this same post at 80$ 90$ 100$ etc... My advice would be to do it now before its too late and the price goes above 1000$
@_date: 2013-08-01 13:30:46
It honestly comes down to what the Silk Road is using as its medium of exchange. As long as it is bitcoins we are good.

i use cavirtex.com feels more secure 3% transaction fee sucks though

I think there might be a way to use satoshi dice to claim it as gambling winnings.

Ive just seen a similar post and I believe the government is not only behind bitcoins but wants them to succeed. Maybe they aren't all evil and see bitcoins as a way to save our current broken financial system. And yet  I see no evidence of a helpful government.

They are professional scam artists, they aren't gonna flash their extravagance all over the internet for me to point it out to you. Even better they just stash as much now as they can before spending it. I don't need a "horse for this race" or a "dog for this fight"(i loled) because they will dig their own graves.

I believe with Bitpay one only needs an email to sign up and remains anonymous by name. BTC is definitely the solution to micropayments because it is divisible .00000001 and yes also how about a link to your site? :)

Hoarding is the problem of deflation because bitcoins are worth more tomorrow... wait WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM? Well I guess the economy slows down and people for the time being only buy what they need?! so now there are layoffs and hour cuts because we would no longer have to work as much since people aren't buying as much. At first this sounds bad BUT actually we work less for more money... this reverses todays problem of working more and more for less n less money. Imagine being asked to work undertime this week instead of overtime. more free time to do the things that you want.

Unless the government secretly already controls bitcoin and wants it to succeed. Otherwise they would've taken it down by now.

Exactly what they should be doing so that if they haven't met their goal then everyone is refunded. The way they have it now is that they will let the few people who want refunds to go ahead knowing that will only make them look more credible as a business. Plus because bitcoin as money is a grey area they can keep this going undetected for larger gains on their part.

We have cycles because of "human nature"? Credit is dumb and by looking at these cycles they benefit generations and screw over other generations as opposed to no credit and steady growth. It's like popping MDMA to feel amazing every weekend and coming down and feeling shitty during the week instead of just gradually moving up through life. Either way you end up old and dead in the future. So would you rather have good economic times with the balance of bad economic times or steady growth? Either way we end up an older civilization down the road.

Sell little bits on the way up and buy little bits when the price goes down. The more volatile it is the more this becomes profitable as most people panic buy on the way up and panic sell on the way down.
