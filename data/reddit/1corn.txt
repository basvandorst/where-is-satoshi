To be fair, the 2017 bull run didn’t really pull in massive amounts of new people until BTC reached around 4x - 5x previous ATH and started producing the corresponding headlines.

I know this post is a month old, but I'll go ahead and comment anyway ...
Just tried [Lieferservice.de]( for the first time after finding out they accept Bitcoin. Yes, it's not cheaper - but it was definitely faster to pay using my wallet app instead of entering my credit card info and waiting for + entering my 2-way-verification code. Very convenient, extremely fast and kind of historic - my first crypto pizza. :) Will definitely do this again in the future.

LPT: You can sell many gift cards online (for 50-90% of their value). Also, check cooperations: We have a neighbor who gifts us €100-200 worth of perfume coupons a year. We learned that we can also use them at a media online shop (doesn't say so anywhere, we Googled it). So now we can at least get some movies and books for them, too

Of course there are exceptions. But in most cases it makes you look like someone who can't type correctly. (E.g. to younger and non-US readers.)
As another example, in Germany the Deutsche Rechtschreibreform was introduced in 1996 and changed German spelling rather profoundly. Many more *tradition-bound* writers and critics of the reform disregareded it entirely. For some years it was a statement to adhere to the now-obsolete rules. But today younger readers who never learned the old rules (and these *young* readers can be ~20 to ~25 today) just consider them slightly dyslexic.

First, let me say I think we have a similar opinion on the matter, just looking at it from different angles. I mostly agree with you, but still think that every development of media and technology has slowly moved society in the direction of transparency **and** decentralization - from the Luther Bible to the internet.
Transparency does always have a decentralizing effect and distributes power. You mentioned the Comcast-clusterfuck, which is awful, but there **are** repurcussions. We have petetions against the Comcast-Time Warner merger, Comcast is already branded the most hated company of the US, and Google Fiber lurks in the nooks and corners of the country, ready to capitalize on the situation.
I admit that the process often feels awfully slow looking at the disgusting things still happening in the *developed* world, but it's always two steps forward, one step back. While the emergence of the internet took away a lot of influence from former centres of power in a heartbeat, the last decade felt extremely demoralizing at times. Also, globalization radically increased the pool of potential targets for governments and monopolistic corporations to profit from, further clouding the picture.
A public ledger may not move all the obstacles out of the way towards a free and open society, but certainly a few, and I'm very optimistic that Bitcoin (or decentralized crypto currency in general) will immensely contribute to the next two steps - due to its very nature, as you concluded your comment.
(Edit for clarification)

At least in my experience and as a German it is **very** common to ask for something like *1200 grams of mince,* for example. And then there's the *2000-Meter-Lauf* or the fact that in day-to-day life you never use m³ or km³.

Compared to internet history crypto currencies are roughly  in their 1940s - Vannevar Bush just came up with the idea of hyperlinks and non-hierarchic data structures and played around with some crazy ideas about the distribution of information in the computer age. 
We have a long way to go but the blockchain is too powerful a concept to not become a global defacto standard in the long run. No idea if it has to **replace** traditional currencies for that to happen.

*That symbol is ugly* is a disrespectful and unconstructive way to give feedback to someone who (pretty much selflessly) put a lot of effort into sth.
What do you mean by *ugly?* Do you mean that you, subjectively, think it's not pleasing? In this case, while the creator has to accept your opinion, it's not very valuable in the big picture and still poorly phrased. 
Or do you think, from a more objective point of view, that it could be improved in terms of typographic implementation and/or cultural, historic, technical and branding-related aspects? Than be more specific.
@_date: 2014-07-16 11:27:55
Besides escrow implementations, another very interesting approach is **smart property.** What if, for example, a car/house/boat could stream and understand the block chain and KNOW who its owner(s) is/are?
Edit: Any kind of property could carry a unique ID which would be linked to block chain transactions. You can model any kind of business (or private interaction like lending sth. to a family member) around this idea. Renting, buying, subscribing, deferred payment, you name it.

There are endless possibilities. Systems could be implemented to fight corruption and waste by programming Satoshis as soon as they're transferred to the government so that they can only be spent for a particular thing.

So cool! There's just one thing I still struggle to understand: An implementation like this obviously means reusing a receive-address. Am I right to assume that it's considered bad practise, but "kind of ok"?

5101 so far. And no achievements after 4000... But I got all the letters, too! You receive 2000 ingame BTC for that.
Btw, you can take [screenshots]( on iOS.
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:18:53
But you set up a receive address in the settings of the game? I think tipping doesn't start before that. 
And it has nothing to do with the (fake) in-game BTC coins you collect and can buy.
@_date: 2015-01-18 12:09:58
Nothing screwy going on, it's a logarithmic scale. On a linear scale the same data would look more dramatic. So if anything, OP is lessening the effect here.
But eventhough I think it's a valid point of view and certainly funny, I'm pretty sure we'll see the first drop in 2015 (though not below the level of 2013).
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:15:41
Yeah, they get a lot of shit from this sub, but eventhough they may not be the biggest Bitcoin and decentralization idealists, their business makes many others in the space look laughably unprofessional. Their Android app is beautiful and super usable, the web interface always works, there were no hacks so far and I never had any issues with transactions.
Happy for them.
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:49:22
That's what that is :D Always passed it too quickly. Thanks.
Also, [I received 0.0009 BTC]( in ~1.5h. Bad luck? Or how long did you play?
@_date: 2015-01-18 15:05:08
No, that's a fair question. Last year's Bitcoin hype, in hindsight, was  premature. A lot of people heard about it for the first time, mainstrem media started covering it, and the price exploded very quickly. I held 3 or 4 BTC at the time and had no idea what to make of it myself.
We're now in a long phase of correction. If Bitcoin has a future, it's currently undervalued. If it doesn't (at least on a larger scale) - well, it will probably never disappear, but I think it's realistic to assume the price could (and would) drop below $1 again. 
What we're seeing now, in my opinion, is a price that's kind of justified in relation to the current actual use of Bitcoin, while hype and fear pretty much cancel each other out.
@_date: 2015-01-12 10:15:09
Well it's the game the whole post is about.
@_date: 2015-01-03 12:29:38
I first invested in Bitcoin in late 2012, without understanding most of the underlying principles.
I started to mine Dogecoin because the community seemed genuinely helpful. Very quickly I learned a lot about the idea of the blockchain, about hashrates, pools and how transactions and addresses work.
I don't see other cryptos as investment, some of them just offer interesting opportunities to play around with.
@_date: 2015-01-03 12:21:44
True. Though I'd like to argue that Dogecoin has never been a scam by any definition. It's still a fun playground to learn about crypto currency and the blockchain in an affordable way, embedded in a friendly and helpful community.
@_date: 2015-01-03 16:42:29
Well, technically you're right. But it sure was for me. When I wanted to learn about mining in early 2013, everyone on just told me it was too late. I was able to start mining Doge successfully (and almost profitably, even though that wasn't a requirement for me) on the same day I joined Also, there were still many working Doge faucets online and people tipped like crazy. An ideal situation for somebody who mainly wanted to learn and experiment.
Besides that, I used Doge to become familiar with all the different kinds of wallets. Not knowing how to transfer crypto securely, Doge was ideal as even in the worst case I'd never lose more than a few $.
In the meantime, I regularly bought BTC at bitcoin.de and, later, Kraken.

Couldn't agree more. And don't forget, in what ever way governments around the world will regulate cryptocurrencies, they can not change the fundamental mechanisms like issuance, the blockchain and the egalitarian design. Everyone will always be able to send transactions into and receive transactions from the network.

From Germany, have set my Google to English (you should do the same with every piece of software and service as you'll get many features earlier). When I come back home I just say "OK Google Bitcoin price" and Google tells me the current value over my living room speakers. Pretty futuristic.
BUT - DuckDuck.go is still cool. Everybody should try it for many reasons.
@_date: 2018-04-19 22:29:14
I’ve been using Kraken since 2013, never experienced real issues (except for downtime) and customer service always got back to me, even if it took a while sometimes (e.g. for higher verification tiers). By far (and I mean very far) the most respectable and reliable crypto exchange I have used. I really don’t get the constant bitching.
@_date: 2015-03-09 14:11:00
It's relatively private by default (arguably more so than credit card transactions, and that's what it's compared to in this example). But if you really care for privacy it will take you 2-4 hours max to properly tumble pretty much any amount of BTC. After that, it's not worth retracing you unless you're on a most wanted list.
@_date: 2015-03-12 09:17:26

Gas is difficult. But I can buy Amazon gift cards with eGifter in Germany, so groceries are possible (yet expensive and cumbersome).
@_date: 2015-03-11 22:47:42
I'm not sure. It's prohibited to destroy national currency in many countries (e.g. in the US). I think the paper on which the money is printed actually belongs to the State, while its "intrinsic" value is your property. Probably differs from country to country, too.

Or use one of the many platforms like Vodo, VHX and Humble and start selling DRM-free downloads? Or do it like Louis CK and sell it straight from their website. I'd buy it in a heartbeat.
@_date: 2017-07-24 11:08:29
Maybe. Just for everyone's interest, especially for people outside the US: I just tried it with a fraction of a fraction of my BTC. Took a few clicks and &lt;10s of my time to convert my BTC into BTC Frozen plus .2x my investment in BTC. Worst case scenario I lose .8 of my investment. The process is extremely straightforward.
I will probably leave it at that as the risk of not being able to withdraw my BTC frozen is a little too real for my liking.
@_date: 2015-02-10 09:19:46
But as far as I understand that would be a separate issue, right? Even if the supposed scammer *was* hacked, he would've had to reimburse OP first and then, in an entirely separate case in which OP would not be involved in, press charges against the hacker/unknown.
@_date: 2015-03-11 11:48:01
Developments are slower now with a bigger user base. My bet: We *are* right inside an upswing (first time I truly believe this in months). It's just slowed down by people playing save and realizing smaller profits (and nobody should blame them after last year's dramas).
In the meantime, I'm bulking up (responsibly). And whenever I'm really confident we reached a little peak, I'm buying something with Bitcoin directly instead of buying back Dollars and Euros.
But most of all, I'm more pumped than ever for upcoming news - technologies, services, etc. Most interesting time since I entered the game in 2012.

In March it also dropped more than 50%. So far the correction/crash has still been less dramatic than I expected. But let's see what happens during the next 48 hours.
My guess? Stabilization at around $300 to $500, than a steady increase until 2 mBTC over the course of half a year/a year.
