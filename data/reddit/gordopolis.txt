The hair and food embedded in your keyboard is not dust bro, please don't try to say that, you're embarrassing yourself.
Second, value is relative.  Trezor was rushed to the market to fill a demand that didn't exist even 18 months ago.  It's a first generation device, accept it for what it is and quit bitching about what it's not.

You bribed him and in the process screwed over a bunch of other people who were rightfully ahead of you in the que.  That's just incredibly self serving and shitty of you.

A bribe by definition - 


No one is saying he's a government official yet a bribe is still a bribe.  The very fact he felt the need to do so implies that he would have had to wait much longer had he not induced the owner to accelerate his boat in the que, despite others being a head of him in line.
Bribery is a negative thing because these small acts of corruption attack the fabric of our society and have a tendency to spread when not confronted and exposed for what they are.

I purchased above $800 but I'm quite content to sit on my (fraction of a)bitcoin as I'm incredibly excited about the long term potential and I use that excitement to weather downturns like the one we're currently in.

Are you mentally ill?

Dare I say, sexual napalm?

Unfortunately.   It's just another vehicle for attention.

I want to do you a favor by telling you what a cliché driven and horribly contrived pile of butt dook that is.

So you violated their TOS and they froze your account.
You're selling physical bitcoin and taking fiat via paypal.
The irony never ends.

So you're on welfare, too ill to support yourself in even the smallest of ways but you can jaunt out to steak dinners, be a cheap ass and dick around with the manager for an hour just fine?
Go fuck yourself.

You're exactly the kind of customer businesses don't want or need.  If there is an issue, a normal way to approach it is from a reasonable standpoint and with a reasonable request.  Looking at the way you talk to people shows the kind of person you are and the way you like to handle situations.  I don't blame TD for not wanting to deal with you...

Price gouging people isn't a great way to increase adoption :-\

Is this a joke?  Even if it is, the mods maybe shouldn't leave that link up...

BraveTheWorld is a joke.  It's just the immature, self important exposition of a tumblr-age armchair activist.

You're complaining about the screen?  You use that disgusting filthy keyboard in the background on a daily basis and that DOESN'T bug you?

Please don't give Julia Tourianski and her pseudo–intellectual bullshit anymore attention :-\

One issue that you admittedly didn't want to take the time to have corrected...?
Who's the douche again?

Didn't mean to jump down your throat, sorry.  Just watch some of her other videos and you'll see what I mean :-/

A 'business man' who can't even compose a letter?  Right.
Better go call the waaaaaahhhh-mbulance.

You won't be in business long with that attitude.

Alas, poor Gox! I knew him, Satoshi; an exchange of infinite wealth, of most excellent currency; it hath borne me on its back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is.

Seeing things like this really makes you realize how tenuous their position really is
@_date: 2016-09-08 19:17:48
This sounds incredibly contrived

Please don't try to dictate the kind of feedback people can give you.  
You're an adult and this is the internet.
Having said that, nice first video.  Kill the beeping, boost the gain on your mic and try to frame your shots better.
