Regular(traditional) currencies are issued by governments (they control supply) and can print as much paper as they want /feel necessary ... this creates inflation causing the bang for your buck to decrease by 2% a year. (In the us) banks usually charge fees and use your money to invest in shit like the Dakota pipeline (chase , us bank , Barclays, Bank of America ,Wells Fargo ,city bank and many more ) furthermore, in times of economic woes as seen In Greece banks have put limits on the amount of euros people could withdraw each day (60 euros) and a "haircut" was taken from people's bank accounts to help settle the debt with the e.u .
Bitcoin enters the equation in 2008 , a decentralized currency not controlled by any government or person but by a network of computers that is ever growing . It was also designed to be deflationary with the total amount of bitcoin to be created set at 21million ( this creates scarcity) but it is possible to own portions of a bitcoin .000001 bitcoins . 
One simply downloads a bitcoin wallet ( your personal account) and you can receive and send around the world pretty easy . 
At least that's just what I've heard :p

Is there a way to figure out how many of the bitcoins mined each day are sold ?

What kind of company do you have ? Do you want to keep the bitcoin or transfer it to fiat ? Do you have employees you will need to train or is it online ?

Not really , it's exactly why we use bitcoin so governments can't take our money to cover their debts and wars .
