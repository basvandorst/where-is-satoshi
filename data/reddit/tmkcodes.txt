I'm sorry. It was my mistake not to add the investment to the valuation before calculating percentage. They match that way.

Very sorry about confusing with the 3.5x valuation question. I should have just asked where that valuation comes from and who made it?
It is very true that startups have great potential, but you know that most businesses die and bitcoin is very competitive business. I don't see why bittiraha was valued so much because of possible potential when some investors might not see returns in quite a while. I think valuation of 1.5 million would have been much better, because that is just years worth of speculation. You should know to keep in mind the investors and valuation based on possible growth is some of the worst possible speculation when the business might die tomorrow. The best way is to explain where that valuation comes from and everything would be fine. 
It's not like I am saying Bittiraha does not offer good service. I love your service, but right now if I see too much stuff like this I'm ready to switch to your competitor anyday. Kickstarter campaign would have probably completed your fundraising faster than invesdor. Though that is speculation and I don't know everything you guys are planning and I hope everything goes well.

Thank you for partly answering my question. Following.. 
On your so called first round with 3 private investors how 1.5 million valuation becomes only 105k € investment, did you sell only 7% of the pie? When you could have made 300k € from accredited angel investors at that valuation by selling 20% of the pie. 
Now we see something very odd about your current round. How your maximum 500k € target is only 15.38% of the pie offered when 500k € would actually be 18.18% at 2,75 million € valuation?
Very cheeky answers about serious questions some people might want to know. I hope you can keep living your dream!

Why did you use 3.5 x valuation at invesdor?

Well someone already tried to ask at the invesdor investor forum why the company valuation is at 2.750.000,00 €. I don't see Henry answered well enough where that valuation comes from. That 2.75 million is high in my mind even when expected turnover for next year is at 1.5 million. I just took the 3.5 x valuation from Henry's own answer about Safello.
I'm registering Oy next week with two co-founders and would we valuate our service which has not made any revenue at 1.75 € share when we are going to pay just 0.5 € per share for the required capital? Great I'll sell third of my shares right away! :D
