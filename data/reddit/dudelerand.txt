I think the people who bought in last thursday are panic selling because this is the first major dip they're seeing as they agonize over whether or not to hodl.  That's might have a ripple effect, since that was a LOT of new people.

How far into the "public adoption" phase do you think we are for bitcoin (bubble or not)? Does it concern you that the media coverage is going to get a lot of investors with weak stomachs pouring into the platform and destabilize it? For a more optimistic spin: do you think there will be investment opportunities in the near future?

Guys, be careful about buying right now because the price is going up.  A lot of people are moving funds out of their alt coins and into bitcoin.  That is causing the price to go up, but (I think) they're doing that so that they can sell in anticipation of futures.  I think we'll see another correction by this evening.

Yeah, I just cashed out half of my BTC I bought in late Nov, so I'm pretty much just HODLing the rest because I believe in bitcoin/crypto, not so much because of the profits.  It's very difficult to not sell while the price is relatively stable and high-ish, but if anything this is a test of willpower.

I went in about a week ago and went 60-40 between eth and btc and I have to say I'm kicking myself right now.  It's funny because I've still made a ridiculous profit, all things considered.  Guess we're just impatient by nature.

Yep, look at that price just plummeting..oh wait.

Remember, this is just a testing period for them as well.  Picture it like two animals circling around and assessing one another.  Futures whales could strike at any moment.

The arbitrage between GDAX and bittrex was so insane for LTC.  It was like 40 dollars at one point (and obviously transferring was more practical than for ether or bitcoin).  I just made a weeks worth of wages buying and selling between the two.  Of course I used it to buy more Bitcoin.

So I bought .1 btc on friday along with about 2 eth and 5 ltc.  I initially wanted to diversify, but I'm second guessing myself.  I like the premise behind litecoin, but I've got sort of a bad feeling about ethereum.  In your opinions, was investing in something other than btc a bad idea?  Should I just sell the other two and buy btc with the money?

Cut through that resistance like butter.

Timing the dips is pretty difficult.  It's very volatile right now, and the pattern feels particularly indecisive (as does the sentiment around here).  Starting to feel more like a house of cards.

This is giving me a much bigger "scared to lose money" vibe than a big bank vibe.  That may be a good thing, as it means a lot of the new money entering the market is now leaving, thereby increasing stability tomorrow.  I really hope it drops today and stays down, not because I want to buy in, but because it's important for bitcoin to not be walking on stilts.

So do you think people are going to short right before futures open on Sunday?  Or possibly on Saturday in order to try and beat the crowd?  Also, after BTC (presumably) gets shorted, how quickly do you think it will bounce back?
