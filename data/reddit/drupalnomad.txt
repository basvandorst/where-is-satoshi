Thanks for the tip!
It's true that posters could get away with not paying the miner fee. There is a proposal on Lighthouse to add a required fee to BIP70. Also, if this technique became a standard of its own, it could have a required fee.

It needs to be a bitcoin: link so you can just tap on it to pay.

Could this might damage SEO?

Your are basically spamming yourself by requiring the dust transaction. It may not be economical to try to spend it. As mentioned in the blog post you could just generate random address for the transactions to be sent to - effectively burning the dust.

I tried it with both 5460 and 546 satoshis. Both propagated immediately and got confirmed. The schildbach wallet can send 546 satoshis, but the smallest Mycelium can send is 5460.
If a transaction wasn't getting confirmed, the website could keep rebroadcasting it, keeping all the nodes aware of it (preventing double spend) and eventually it will get confirmed.

I think support for xpubs is very close to zero at the moment and we need to be doing it a whole lot more. 
I am thinking of starting an advocacy campaign to get everyone supporting xpubs.

Using fonts in this way is really bad for accessibility. For example, if the browser font is switched to a font that aids dyslexics then the image will disappear. SVG is the technology you are looking for.

You need a debaseable currency to fund war.

Do you have a citation for that?

I think the transaction size can be bigger when spending from a multi-sig address, but sending to a P2SH address has the same size output as sending to a P2PKH.
