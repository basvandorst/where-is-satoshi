You can even do an address just with a dice, a pencil and a paper. (

That would never happen in a democratic country. Why would they ban the use of crypto? Based on what? Total nosense

This is really bad for BTC ecosystem, users should stop using Coinbase as soon as they can. What they are doing is inexcusable.  
    
As another user said: "What they're doing is dumb, wasteful, and actually somewhat harmful to other users of the network, even if you withdraw through GDAX and don't pay that confirmation fee yourself."

Really useful, gives more useful information

lol, Blackcoin is less than 1 minute payments, proven secure since 2014, POS (and so, ecofriendly), has atomic swaps and colored coins. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:30:46
Yes, any Bitcoin address can send to any Btc type address
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:34:46
Doesn't that much billions allow you to hire more developers?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:49:07
Twitter is going crazy with Bcash these days
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:24:45
"Coinbase needs to set up a better system to where THEY buy the sale orders" Do you really know what you have just said? This is fucking crazy, please don't do that kind of statements

I’m on the same situation. Sent a support ticket more than a month ago and no answer. I’ve alredy sent them mi I’d car and a picture of myself holding it. No answers
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:59:15
I have already sold a bunch, cunt. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:22:52
Greater are my profits :)
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:00:31
Can't resist. Buying more

Take a look at your computer. My MacBook pro works perfect
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:58:53
Developer has been working in the code for more than 6 months. If source code gets revealed right now it will be copied.
@_date: 2014-07-04 19:32:24
Blackcoin pump? It hasn't been announced like other coins do with their pumps. Is just another development work that tries to give something new to crypto currency world. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 06:26:03
If you have a fire insurance. Would they pay for the lost bitcoin? Does somebody know?
@_date: 2014-11-30 18:58:58
This exchange is awesome. Works really good
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:15:26
 more Blackcoin development. Right now all promises have been shown in facts. Developing new things and not copying.  :)
Have a good night
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:38:57
Of course there are a lot of shitty and copy coins. Blackcoin for example has been copied by more than 40 other alts. If you do some research you will see that development team is really competent and active.
@_date: 2014-05-18 21:05:49
Is not profitable unless you have referrals.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:10:13
Lol, silly alt coin? Do you know how much development is happening in the alt coin world? Do you believe in the centralization of virtual currencies only having bitcoin? Being Bitcoin the only one? To have Bitcoin and say that Bitcoin is the only one is quite silly.
@_date: 2014-06-18 22:08:49
Totally agree. I think that this leak is to pump the price showing big names interested in Bitcoin.

Gracias a Dios que alguien me entiende

You understood nothing, of course the market dump happened and was affected partialy by those Mt Gox coins being sold for paying creditors, with my post, I'm saying that is really improbable that the 170.000BTC left are gonna be sold directly in the market causing it a massive dump. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:32:03
In Spain, and I suppose in many countries, there is a legal figure called "**illicit enrichment**". That's what Mark Karpless would be doing by getting those coins, therefore, those coins shouldn't go to his hands.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:58:35
Yes, of course, thats clear. What I'm explaining is that there is no basis for the trustee to continue dumping coins. It can't be done like that and It would go against creditors best interest
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:03:24
Which exchanges or merchants use Bitcoin instead of Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:24:15
It’s funny how you Americans think your shitty laws can be applied worldwide independently of where the company is located. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:42:30
lol, "stop loss" it's just its name but it´s set at whichever price you want.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:16:38
That's what I though. Looking at his comments, IDK if is trolling or just stupid.
@_date: 2015-04-27 11:00:15
A week ago it happened the same to me. By using Bit2me, here in Spain, I was able to buy cigarettes and continue drinking. Thank you Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:27:52
Hate this kind of advices. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 14:35:55
That tv Programm is called "Ratones coloraos" it was the first spanish program to start interviewing what we call now as "freaks". 
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:40:55
It's not working for me
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:23:04
Just a Bitcoin address and a QR code. Nothing else.
