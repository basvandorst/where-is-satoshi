No, but it's an unfortunately reality of the domain you've established yourself in.  I'm a web developer myself, and I've experienced it first hand more than once, so I know the feeling -- it sucks but that's just how it goes.
This site did manage to one up you guys with the layout.  Yours has always bugged me, mainly because the content is centered but the header is flush left leaving a margin on the right.  It just looks bizarre, and I never would have tried your service if it hadn't been from the recommendations of some of your past customers. So I could see someone who's never heard of either of you leaning in InstaBT's favour just because it looks more crisp and professional.
What this site doesn't have is the history and reputation that your site has. I've already developed a trust from working with you guys and I'm not looking to rebuild that somewhere else. However don't let your past success blind you, you guys have a lot of room for improvement in both your layout and user experience.  Take this as an opportunity to be critical of your own product and making it even better so that your site is the obvious choice.

Is there no way to just get an overview of my entire balance in both mBTC and my local currency?  I have stuff split up over several accounts but like to keep an eye on my overall value.
Overall I'm quite happy with it.  Just switched from BlockChain's app and it was driving me nuts. Was getting so many SSL errors and failed PIN attempts, just couldn't get it working.  Mycelium just works and it's much nicer on the eyes :)

Not always, depends on the bank, depends on the card. 
Besides, your point really has nothing to do with mine.  I was just pointing out that bitcoin itself wasn't hacked here, not about which system was better.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:28:32
We just broke $1015 Canadian.  That was pretty exciting for me. Now it's back down to $996 but that was the highest I've seen yet. I smoked a bowl then shed a tear for all the bitcoins I didn't buy last year.

Nope, definitely not the case. IF it happened once or twice I'd be inclined to agree.  But when you sit there for 20 minutes entering it over and over with the utmost care then it's obviously on their end.

I've actually gotten very good at predicting what the market will do.  I've discovered an event that reliably predicts a drop in gold price. It always, without question, happens the day after I buy some.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:16:05
Yeah I was debating something like that.  But I've already got some fractional gold, including a 1/10 krug.  Was really hoping for the 1oz.

Thanks for the info, already have one of those US accounts, had no clue I could use it. Also was not aware of QuickBT, just did a small transaction and it was a breeze.  Easiest one I've done so far. I will probably be using that from now on but I'll look into your CaVirtex trick for anything larger. Actually, I have a few hundred USD sitting in that account right now... hmmm....
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:14:00
Yeah they're pretty decent, I've made a few buys off them and had the money in my wallet within seconds.  They keep lowering the limit though. It was 0.05 yesterday, then 0.04 later that day and now it's 0.03.  
They're also reporting that 1 BTC = $980.00CAD when in reality it's $653.28 at the moment.  So just be mindful that they're slow to update their prices. I'm currently waiting for that to be corrected before I buy more.

Tried all of those, most of them over complicate the buying process.  Besides, I figured it out long ago, no need to tell me shit I already know.

You're welcome.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:06:40


Nothing is 100%.  In any case, this wasn't an issue with the bitcoin protocol being hacked. It was either a buggy or malicious app.
It's like if your computer got hacked and someone stole your credit card info.  Your credit card company didn't get hacked, you did. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:27:05
Do you actually get $1000 USD though?  Or is it minus 3% in credit card fees?

You're a long hike from me or else I'd offer to buy some off of you.  My only other suggestion would be Vault of Satoshi.

That's good to hear, QuickBT is mainly what I use right. Not loving their daily limits though.

I tried two email addresses last night, still no response. Not in my spam box either.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:25:58
I use paypal daily and I don't agree with that. Every time I transfer money out of my paypal I'm stuck waiting days for it to clear, which is partially due to me being Canada.  I also pay a hefty conversion fee from USD.  On top of that the buyer  protection is just that, it does nothing *to protect* the seller.  There are a lot of well known scams that take advantage of the fact that paypal almost always sides with the buyer, which makes me hesitant to sell anything through them.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:12:59
What about  It was my understanding that they were the US version?  I can't vouch for them though, as I'm Canadian.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:08:36
I spent half my day fighting in there yesterday then gave up. Even if you prove to them that every concern they have is unjustified they will still believe what they want to believe.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:14:15
So how's that work then?  You send the BTC and have to wait an hour for your money? How does the machine know it's you again when the money is ready? (I'm assuming others can use it while you wait for confirmation)
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:25:25
It's easy to buy BTC with cash, at least in larger cities.  Find someone on localbitcoins, meet up with them, hand them cash, they send you BTC.  Voila, no banks involved.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:12:27
Not true at all, with a service such as Bitpay it's converted into USD and deposited into his bank account all for a 1% fee.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:25:09


No, quite the opposite.  Being "part of the problem" is if you panic sell the moment it dips.  Buy when it's down, sell when it's up.  It sounds easy but so many people panic and end up doing the opposite.

@_date: 2013-11-29 00:20:35


Not really when you consider that most of the exchanges use US dollars. 95% of your bitcoin news will also be reporting in US dollars. So it's an extra step with an added cost, but no biggy.  Do a deposit at BMO and tell them it needs to go in as USD and they will do it all in one step.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:27:38
Sounds good, I have some US cash so I'm set there. But yeah I was worried it would be $15 like the bank wire which is too steep unless you're putting on a thousand or more, which I dont have.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:34:26
Perhaps this will be a lesson to elaborate on your posts so people know what the fuck you're trying to say.

Nah, spending it is easy enough.  Unless you want to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:14:48
Another one not mentioned here is QuickBT.com.  Small daily limits, but you can order online with Interac.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:10:48
Your twisting my words, I was referring specifically to buyer/sell protection, though I can see how you made that mistake so I have added a word to my original comment for clarity. 
All you've done is further illustrated that buyer protection = buyer protection and not seller protection. That's great that it may make a buyer more inclined to buy from a seller, which might increase their sales, but in no way equates to seller protection.
Also, keep in mind we're comparing apples to oranges here. Paypal is not a currency, it's an escrow service. There are many escrow services out there for bitcoin, I haven't used any myself but there's certainly nothing stopping people from creating one that offers buyer and seller protection.

I personally don't hear it in my area, but North America is a big place.  I doubt too many people would be confused if you said everyone was "queued up" or "in queue." So while it may not be a common expression, people do know what it means.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:05:42
No, they're not afraid of it. It has nothing to do with bitcoin. It's resource intensive, and you're not the only one on the VPS so it's effecting other users. Get an actual private server if you want to run intensive software, as you'll have a hard time finding a shared server that will let you.

Two main issues I've been having are:
1) Constantly rejects my pin, even though it's correct.  Seems to happen more over my Wifi, not sure what the reason is. Eventually it asks for your full password, and even that it rejects half the time.
2) Constant SSL errors when it's updating. So often the price is wrong because it's using one that's a day or more old.
3) Lack of configuration options.  You go into settings but it takes you to the website which has no config options for the app. All I can seem to do is unpair and repair the phone.  Haven't yet found a way to reset my pin to see if that fixes the issue.
