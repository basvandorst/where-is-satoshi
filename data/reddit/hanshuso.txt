is this utilizing xcp in any significant way?
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:35:03
but if it is all obvious - why doesn't want of the core developers/ founders stand up and say: yes we are planning to use xcp as the fuel for running smart contracts on the counterparty/symbiont hybrid?

I think cheap or zero-cost international transfers.
I have to admit that I also do not fully understand why they need bitcoin in this system

it is the best we have at this point isn't it?
the fees are only for withdrawals - the sidechain project needs at least another year
the reason why changetip is great because it INCLUDES a new group of users which are not forced to buy nor to mine bitcoins.
they get bitcoins for quality content - that is nothing but a great idea

the argument for transparency &lt;3
they do not have 5 minutes to find out that bitcoin is a decentralized transparent ledger?
I hope he provides a link where I can follow all transactions mastercard was doing since its inception :)

thanks for clarification  
just to make clear I understood it properly, taken your example, the 1000 sidechaincoins are initially pegged by 1 BTC, it can never fall below 1BTC, because I can always change them back to 1 BTC. Due to sidechaincoins scarcity and the great functionality the price of 1000 sidechaincoins, can at a later point be greater than 1BTC?
can someone verify this?
@_date: 2014-11-17 15:04:39
is there another reliable source for that - or other investigations regarding that?
or maybe even the original draft?
changetip is waiting ;)
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:24:48
do not get me wrong i like the general idea of sidechains, but why shouldn't someone inventing something beautiful not be monetarily rewarded by it? Why didn't Satoshi fix the Bitcoin Price? Next question is who fixes the prices for the alts on sidechains? For me demand and supply do the best at setting prices. Fixing prices is and always will be under every circumstances horrible - it never works. The idea of using sidechains and establishing Bitcoin Protocol as TCP/IP is brilliant. 
Where these guys are completely wrong is their idea of FORCING digital scarcity towards bitcoins, this will not work.

wtf is this shit
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:02:08
I am generally pro sidechains, it will take cryptoeconomics on a higher level and I really like to see this in the most secure and most mature network. 
BUT from economical non-technical perspective pegging and fixing sidechain-tokens prices is on so many levels horrible.
 
Please convince me that particularily this implementation is neccessary, because for me it is a major drawback and very likely to fail

if something is scarce and has a unique utility or function it cannot be stupid to think it has no value

what is so great on changetip is that it includes new bitcoiners without mining as well as buying.
they produce quality content they get a tip - I spread love on youtube now :)

I also assumed it be here in the end of november.
@_date: 2014-10-30 11:48:12
exactly, you can take this graph in every bubble bitcoin has seen before.
you can see this development in almost every altcoin
the big difference to altcoins is that bitcoin has several bubbles where the userbase grew massively - and every time it reached a new all time high
if the governments do not rule btc dead this development will go on up to a point where bitcoin reaches every days life.
if you guys really think this point is reached, when the best place to buy bitcoins is an unregulated exchange somewhere in slovenia or maybe russia, you have not seen anything yet

@_date: 2014-04-21 22:44:59
he is nothing but right - a currency is by definition something the state controls
cash or money and that is what bitcoin is can none the less play a great role in everyones life 
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:41:21


the future is uncertain - especially long term. 
what is your safe investment over a period of ~35 years?
if he says he believes that bitcoin plays a role greater than the role now in a few years what is wrong with putting it in the system? show me one investment which has a higher expected value...
the argument obviously only works for young people - if you are in the mid fifties and put almost all of your savings into bitcoin, I would not say it is great idea
@_date: 2014-11-26 22:33:52
well it could be the case that two persons have at different times basically the same idea.
that said this post is an incredibly accurate description of the current system of bitcoin - I assume it was created by satoshi
@_date: 2014-11-17 10:16:38
good points,
from a logical point of view there will be one dominant decentralized transparent ledger - which I think will be with a close to 100% certainty bitcoin, also the systems you pointed out would do much better if they would use bitcoin in the future.
I assume that there will be a second a dominant ledger, the decentralized privated ledger - I think this will be a ledger, which is due to political reasons not bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-11-18 14:40:54
what I never understood regarding bubbles is the core underlying. if people assume that bitcoin can be a store of value in the future, which is due to its design definitely not a bad idea and start speculating that it will be - is that a bubble?
maybe in my mother tongue bubble is to negatively or better more negatively connoted than in english. 
but even his conclusion that the main value of bitcoin will be for central banks regarding electronic cash is quite funny. the value of bitcoin derives by its decentralized consensus that the tokens are worth something outside the control of central authorities
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:08:52
the differences are 1. it is running 2. it had one of the fairest launches 3. the developers are not personally enriched by a somewhat IPO 4. it is open source 5. it has an atomistic market structure due to max burn of 1btc per adress

it will be two different products as well as markets - it will be exciting to see if there is/ will be a bridge between these permissioned ledgers and permissionless ledgers

what the bitcoin community and even satoshi failed to specify is what bitcoin actually is. the differentiation between *money* and *currency* is quite elemental.
satoshi used the term *currency* in his whitepaper - this is from an economics perspective extremely problematic.
krugmans argument (and I think most economist share this argument) is that a *currency* is backed by governments force to ask for taxes in *that specific form currency* - for more information see modern monetary theory: 
bitcoin would do better to call itself at best *cash* or maybe even better *money* - this would help to get some serious discussion with economist.
krugman at the same time would do better to inform deeper about bitcoin because some of his assumptions are at best based on misconceptions about bitcoin or at worst wrong. he definetely lacks vision and has a status quo bias. 
at the same time I feel terribly ashamed for the people calling him a clown. I assume his knowledge about *currency* not *money* is higher than the knowledge of anyone in this sub. his analysis of macroeconomics is remarkable and he belongs to the most renonwned economists of our time.

while the network could have the character of a public good (non-rivalry, non excludibility), the speed of transaction could get the character of a private good, including rivalry and excludibility. this has some serious implication on the neutrality of the network.

while I am with you that counterpartyd was hell to run (belonging to the burners I had to use it ;) ), the counterwallet is for end users quite practical and easy to manage. additionally there will be a gui in the foreseeable future.
what is confusing for me, is that other exchanges for example bter and poloniex do not seem to have the same issues as you do
