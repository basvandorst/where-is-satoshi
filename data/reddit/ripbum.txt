Please stop the FUD with gold. I get it, it's tough to use as a medium of exchange - in which bitcoin serves as a better option (BTW, how much taxes did she have to pay for that purchase?).  
She could've used a gold-backed Mastercard from [goldmoney.com]( You purchase gold and it's stored in vaults around the world - fully insured and audited.  When you're ready to spend, you go on the website, transfer from gold to fiat then you can debit it.

Not many know this but Warren Buffet is a big time insider trader.  Obviously, it's a non-crime because he ain't in jail.

Yea he tried to recover it when he found BTC at $1000 back in 2014.

A buddy of mine mined about 500 BTC back in the day.  He  forgot about it and formatted his hard drive.  This begs the question:  How many BTCs are out there "lost" forever?  I probably mined about 2 and gave up.  I'm sure there are hundreds or thousands of miners who "lost" their BTCs forever which, should make BTC even more rarer.

Hehe I like Pi. I thought about putting 314,159...

Banks don't have mining rigs.
@_date: 2019-08-01 11:43:33
But over 20% of bitcoins possibly lost forever due to mistakes, negligence, incompetence or newbies.

Read the book "Creatures from Jekyll Island" and Ron Pauls End the Fed around 09. I was like everyone else feeling the pain of the stock market crash of 08. Thats when I saw gold/silver rise like crazy. I just started reading Zerohedge articles then and saw an article on bitcoin. Instead of buying or mining then, I was watching the price and reading any news about it..
