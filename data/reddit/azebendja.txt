Good awesome... how about the energy that is needed to mine bitcoins. I bet That's not solar or wind energy.....

No they can not because you have rights (depending where you live). If a bank falls, got bankrupt. It is most likely you lost your money. But hey it is up to you where you STORE your money. 
Lets say you have 1000 bitcoins..... where would you leave it at....... Same way with fiat.....  u might devide it, 50% at home &amp; 50% in a deposit box Somewhere in a building where they might have a huge ass vault a.k.a. bank.

Good points made I was born in the late 80's. 
I have read about this all and shit it is a disaster of course. And God forbid it from happening again.. 
However, people need to stand up, and one way it is good to have btc. Extreme good invention, it makes us think twice about the conditiona of our world which is necessary. 
But spreading hate and creating "cult movement" is very bad for btc reputation imho. Instead use the power and have a leader I would say to negotiate.

I think not only a strong currency but an asset that relatively holds Its value like Gold/Silver/Diamonds etc. Yes it fluctuates but will never go away, Thats Why we need to spread our Total savings.

So now, do you acknowledge the fact that there is a lot of hate and blaming towards banks? I mean complaining is normal, but pure dark hate! Damn dude... get over it.. (in general towards btc community members who do so)
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:42:01
Absolutely not! I am a Ripple/XRP hodler and was wondering where al this hate derives from!
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:36:58
I wouldn't directly say "solved" but it is a closer step to dialogue about these laws. Because in my honest opinion there is more hate spreading instead of building towards a adult conversation.

Okay, I understand your frustrations. But, is that an actual problem that banks are creating? Or are these gouvernemental laws/rules which are prohibiting banks from executing your orders?

A leader/speaker That's to prevent chaos, but then again, If btc was made to creatie chaos, enjoy. 
It is just thinking out loud, there is a problem with gouvernements and the monetairy rules/laws and big coorporations doing whatever they want accordeons to bitcoins anarcist philosophy. 
A speaker or leader could help the community forward by using the power of btc to confront and discuss current problems.
