The minimum probability has to do with the current high transaction fees on the network.

You have to make sure that the amount you send plus the fee is equal to the amount in the paper wallet.

Oh yes, I know, you really do need lightning for a chance that algebra goes really does lead to TB blocks, which is totally impractical.

Oh, you can't transfer anything right now, the transaction fee is larger than your wallet balance.

At the same time some simple math shows that if you want north America and Europe to use bitcoin seriously then every person will have at least one open channel, there are some 700M people who need a new channel every month so that they can bank their savings, each Chanel uses 700b to establish, thus we have 490GB per month that must be stored in the blockchain. There are approximately 6 * 24 * 30=4320 blocks per month, thus optimistically if every user has one open channel and this is the only type of transaction we need at oeast 110MB per block. If the whole world uses bitcoin we will need at least 1GB per block if not more even if we use lightning.
Edit: small spelling mistakes fixes.

At the moment it kind-of depends, Transactions with fees between 200 and 1200 sat/B, have been confirmed in the last hour. So you could probably get a basic 250B transaction confirmed for a fee of about 0.00063 BTC, or about USD10. Then again if you want to ensure that a transfer will be confirmed in the next couple houts or two you probably want to pay 1.5x that. If you want to ensure the next block 2-3x that would be required.

As I mentioned before this is not strictly true as yes while the network can have millions of transactions per second, if each user creates or closes a channel each month, which is a reasonable rate for someone banking savings then it can only handle between 4 and 10 million users. This is much better than what exists right now, but is still extremely limiting.
