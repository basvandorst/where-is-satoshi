I know it's inconvenient,  but it's the only way possible with Weebly. If you pay with btc,  avoid the shopping cart and click the bitcoin button. It will take you to bitpay cart. Thank you.

I don't understand what you're saying, but I wish you'd give us a try.  If you're paying with bitcoin avoid the cart and click on the btc button. Thanks!

Gavin, I've been a farmer for 17yrs. I got interested in bitcoin in 2011. Farming has slowed and I would love to change my focus to a career that is bitcoin related. I am 42, married, and have four kids, and I see how bitcoin is changing the world. I'm not a techie, but have an entrepreneurial spirit and am willing to learn. Will anyone out there in this field take on an intern/apprentice?  Any advice??? Thanks!

We've made a note on the cart page to fix the problem. Thanks for making us aware of this! I've spent the last two days just try to figure out how to accept bitcoin on our site, so I feel your frustration.

We do take bitcoin. It's live, and we've had sales. If you use bitcoin click that button and don't use cart. It's the only way I could integrate with my site host (Weebly).

Ive' tried to make the shipping a little cheaper if you use bitcoin.
(Small order shipping bitcoin- $4.00 vs. $5.95 with PayPal order)
Give us a try!
