This phenomenon is called Schroedingers coin. The coin is in a superposition where it is simultaneously legal and illegal until it is observed

This is what this sub needs more of. Memes.  more memes. Memes bring traffic to the sub. Traffic brings price rises. 
There are no bears, there are no bulls. There is only memes

Not saying that correlation equals causation.... but there are less memes now than when it was ATH

I hope it worked! If it didn't say random internet stranger david3692 has a good feeling about this 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:34:07
There you go dude. Good luck!

Reminds me of the victim in boiler room... don't want to panic you there hahah
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:43:59
Difficult to say but just look at the last time it plummeted... a month after the mass panic my holdings were worth almost 3x as much as when people were asking if they should sell
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:39:41
Love it. Chances are no one who can get you in trouble will even understand what you are doing anyway
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:45:33

How did you come across that?

What a glorious 6 months it would be 
@_date: 2019-01-05 10:14:11
Dude it’s so easy! I’ve be buying at the top and selling at the bottom for years! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:07:55
I am still buying in more as I get paid. It’s at the least more fun to watch the Fiat amount fly around all over the place than be in a bank 
Also nothing brave about risking more than you can get away with

Bloody hell. They know their stuff! 
Best of luck with the mining! 
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:26:55
So it's based on transactions in process not ones that's been completed? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:08:10
I'll take that advice...

How quickly does it process and affect the price? 
Looking at the ticket it rocketed 30 minutes after it first hit 3000

20k a month? I'm more interested in whatever your parents do for a living. 
That's where the real money is

Bull - aggressive investor that throws their horns in the air to bring the price up 
Bear - aggressive investor that swipes its paw down and brings the price down 
FUD - fear, uncertainty and doubt. Spreading FUD in the hopes that people will panic sell and you can pick up cheap coins

If you don't mind me asking, why are you doing that? Is there a benefit to yourself or the buyer?

How exactly can the average person like me work for bitcoin or do my bit for bitcoin? 
I’m not a developer or do anything which would allow me to integrate bitcoin as an alternative currency for my service. 
If all I can do is to buy where I can with bitcoin then the majority of purchases costs extra due to fees

Carry on with my day - forget. 
Look at it again - stress out.

Just working my way through this. 
Just to check; I changed my wallet from blockchain app to bitcoin.com wallet app after the fork so now I should send them from my bitcoin.com wallet to the bread wallet? 
Am I recovering the blockchain app wallet not my bitcoin.com wallet?

Lambos was my childhood favourite car. If I had all the money in the world I would have a lambo for that reason. But then I would also get the cars I like today that are more practical and “grown up”
