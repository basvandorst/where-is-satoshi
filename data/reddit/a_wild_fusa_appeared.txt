Technically the supply is still increasing every day but at a slower rate. However as fewer coins enter the market each day you can argue miners are selling more coins average holders like you or me, which means the supply is dropping. That may qualify as an increase in rarity

I use coin base to buy my Bitcoin and move it to a personal wallet, I've never had a problem with them but I've seen a few other redditors will say their not the greatest.

I don't think that's a bad idea, as long as your willing to 'lose' (as in not have it accessible easily, but also potentially a drop in value) roughly $760. I doubt the value will drop back down to $200 but it's also hard to tell when it will hit $1000. So you should be able to flip $300-400 profit but it may not be as quick as you hope. I predict by the end of the summer but my word means nothing.

I think plenty of people are in a state where $10,000 will change their life. Sure it won't jump them up a class or make them millionaires but I know plenty of people, struggling adults, college students, ect who could do a lot with $10,000. Although I do agree if you can invest more why wouldn't you.

I think many people, including myself, see it as an investment right now. Everyone here keeps saying $10K and I've even seen a few optimistic $100Ks, turning a few hundred into a few thousand is a great investment but in the future I hope to spend it as Bitcoin and not trade to USD before buying anything. 
There is definitely some risk in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, but the idea is good enough it's worth investing in so it can grow.

I've been buying LTC lately, really good performance this year and the network is pretty fast. Of course Bitcoin is still like 75% of my holdings because it's always been steady growth in the long term I can rely on.

I have a ledger, with the private key for the wallet you can access it with another ledger USB key if the original gets damaged. Or like me you have two with a backup hidden away just Incase. So it's important to not lose the ledger or get it damaged but it's not an end of the world senecio for the coins stored on it. 
Edit: recovery phrase, not private key.
