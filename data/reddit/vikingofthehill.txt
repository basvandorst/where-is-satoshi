You are an idiot. I am actively involved in fighting against the war on drugs and I personally use drugs recreationally. See what happens when you start thinking that everyone that don't agree with you is somehow a political conservative? Yea, you get proven wrong.
He deserved to be incarcerated for the fact that he ordered people murdered as well as have no quality control on the drugs he sold. As a consequence dumb teenagers died. Just because they could also die from drug slingers on the corner does not change that fact. When drug legalization finally happens it will happen in a regulated manner where the drugs are tested. If you want ecstasy you get pure MDMA, not a random mix of methylone, mephedrone, 2cB, speed and ephedrine. Get it?No you don't, because you are a dumb shortsighted kid

What kids like yourself have to understand is that just because you watched Zeitgeist and smoke weed does not mean you are some revolutionary that see behind the veil.
Ross was a total moron, an amateur and an idiot. He used his own fucking real surname online in open forum to ask for tech details on how to run Silkroad. He was caught at a fucking public library in one of the biggest cities in the united states fully logged into Silkroad. He was a disillusioned idiot who thought he was changing the world and so taking out a few people was no big issue for him. 
Drugs have been dealt online since forever, Silkroad simply made it easier. He's no revolutionare. He deserves to be in prison.

For such deals it is much more likely that there'll be colored coins that are assigned a value and backed by governments. There is no way geopolitics will gamble on something that can lose 90% of its value overnight.

Of course it does not work. Let's say you see a HUGE red candle, so now you say "Ok the price will fall", but *everyone* else in the market also saw it, so they anticipate the same fall. Now tell me, how are you going to be able to say anything about where the fall stops from this info?
People love to talk about trendlines, support etc. but it's pure bullshit palmreading. Technical Analysis is pretty much a perfect example of selective memory. Analysts only remember the times they gambled on a long/short and hit it, but omit the misses from their memory. This leads them to think that they actually know what they are doing

Taxation without consent is robbery.... Is it?
First you postulate an underlying objective morality.
Then you posit that probabilistic causes decide what is rightfully yours.
Finally you conclude that this means that anyone that tries to morally counter random distribution of wealth(through being born into a favorable situation) is somehow amoral and robbers.

This is your new hero? 
Someone that wants to ban abortion. Reflect on this for a few seconds. He wants to strip you of your individual autonomy based on scientific-denialism.
The same guy denies anthropogenic climate change. The single biggest threat to mankind. This means he considers his own random thoughts as more important than the widest consensus ever found in academia. 
He's against sane regulatory frameworks like those put in motion in California to prevent complete drought of the entire state. 
He believes in trickle down economics. Anyone that is asking themselves: "Why is this a bad thing?" Please watch this truth talk by a billionaire capitalist plutocrat: 
He doesn't believe in jobs programs, social security or universal healthcare. We're living in an age where jobs is vanishing due to autonomous systems (robots, artificial intelligence, 3D-printing etc.). Pretty much everyone accepts that 50-80% of jobs will disappear in the coming decades. If there is no universal healthcare or universal wage, you'll see 80% of the population having no reason to even exist anymore. Even though we're already at the place in history where noone would *have* to work and we could all live in lavish luxury and abundance.

ugh... debating teenagers is really not on my priority list, but I can't sleep and it's 1:30 am
1) Decentralization != Anarchy. 
2) Replace traditional government with autonomous regulations via voting on blockchain etc for different implementations ? Sure, that's democracy, not anarchy.
3) Yes, being an anarchist is childish. 
Take 2 people. One is white, attractive, strong, born into a wealthy family, gets great education for free and live next to a goldmine. The other is  black, unattractive, got muscular dystrophy, no education and was born in a dumpster. Which of these will get a good life in an anarchy? Not the dumpsterchild that's for sure. How is this fair? It isn't. The universe does not give a fuck. It's up to society to balance out these imbalances. *THAT* is moral. This "every man for himself!" bullshit is so unfair, unjust and pathetic.
Your default stand that ANY form of government is necessarily immoral also shows that you haven't thought about this. And cute attempt to insult me with "statism". Lol, pathetic.

Listen... For Bitcoin to be adopted in a mainstream fashion globally, regulation *has* to play a role. 99% of the world does not share your childish anarchist fantasies. The majority of people prefer laws, regulations and someone who makes decisions, so they can worry about their lives.
The internet is another example, regulation didn't by default hinder the internets spread across the globe. Just because some regulations are bad doesn't mean all are.
@_date: 2015-04-17 09:56:26


What does that have to do with this debate? And to be honest this just sounds like some ego induced megalomaniac trip. You really think you are so important that you *have to live on* through other cells?


Are you really this naive ? You think that by forcing people to have a baby and then having to give it away to some unknown people, you are not putting these people through emotional turmoil that is way into the torture category ? 
What about the child ? You don't think growing up knowing that you are adopted will affect the child in anyway ? Children are not by default logical creatures, the knowledge of being adopted can lead to all sorts of insecurities and complexes. And what about all the other negatives and risks with adoption?


Again you reveal that you are extremely naive. You don't have time for all the nonsense adoption agencies want. Have you ever actually sat down and reflected on anything in your life ? Do you not think that these agencies are so goddamn invasive and thorough because there exist a lot of dangers and risks in adoption ? You don't just want to hand some random people a goddamn newborn child. There are countless examples of pedophiles adopting babies for the sole intention of sexual abuse. A lot of people who want to adopt just want children for their own sake and don't think about the actual responsibilities involved. You don't want children in the hands of just anybody, it's a living fucking being. 


Yes, let's base society on the presumption that there are charities to help out. It's not like the US is already riddled with millions of people that can't afford to get medical treatment because it would bankrupt their entire family. This idea that charities will just magically pop-up in the future is just ridiculous.
You are so naive and so dumb that I will cease this conversation here. I *really* hope you grow up one day and start reflecting on your political convictions and start basing your opinions on reality and not just religion.

There are already countless websites that cover every ailment and illness imaginable. Websites where you can get a second, third or whatever opinion from trained professionals who will give you their name, credentials as well as reputation online. 
Why would anyone choose to use this sketchy website where anyone could claim to be a doctor, google the symptoms you describe and then hand you the common sense answers for money?
Also how would the doctor prescribe medicine when it's anonymous? And if you don't mean it to be anonymous, lol you wont get a single, not one doctor to sign up. They'd lose their license FTL
@_date: 2015-04-17 09:41:07
That is so naive that I almost have to conclude that you are just trolling, but on the offchance that you are not:
Your spermcells also have DNA in them. So do stemcells in your body. We can already change skin-stemcells into braincells. So I guess you are literally worse than Hitler everytime you masturbate and waste potential 100-500million people ?
Infact according to quantum mechanics every heap of atoms has a non-zero probability of spontaneously forming a human being, so every action that you make that could lessen this probability means that you just killed some potential person. How can you live with yourself?
A fetus without brain activity is nothing but a bunch of cells. It is philosophically equivalent of a non-malignant tumor in that it's just growth. The fact that it has the *potential* to be a child means absolutely nothing. You have enough semen in your testicles right now to theoretically impregnate millions of women. Does that mean that by not forcing all of these women to be pregnant 24/7 we are indirectly murdering billions upon billions of potential people?
I suggest to you to read some rudimentary philosophy as well as basic neurology. If you do this you would quickly get some epiphanies that would stop you from thinking so shallowly and naively as this, which just **might** (*fingers crossed*) stop you from voting a lunatic into office.
I also can't help but point out the hypocrisy of wanting to force people who are unable to take care of a child, to carry a fetus to birth, at which point you guys don't give a single fuck about the baby anymore. No universal healthcare, no social security, no nothing. How will this child and it's parents fare? Bad.

Listen, your ancedotes are cute and all but the science behind diseases is readily available for everyone with an objective mindset that is actually searching for reality. Rand Paul is against the vast mandatory vaccines that is arguably the single biggest achievement of any species ever. That is just batshit crazy.
Re: Abortion. I am assuming that you are alluding to Peter Singer's controversial claims that killing an infant is not morally wrong because it hasn't developed personhood yet? That is not what this debate is about. VERY Few people support Singer in that controverisal argument. It's mainly philosophical in nature. 
What we're talking about in regards to the Paulians is standard abortion that is already solved by science.
The idea that the world should go back to some archaic anarchist economy where you are just dealt whatever hand you are dealt and we should gamble morality on charities, is just pathetic. Everyone that supports it should be forced to move to the North Pole, not reap any of the benefits from the infrastructure and systems put in place by government.
