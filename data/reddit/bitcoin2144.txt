You are helping fund future development. The first desktop PC cost over $10k in inflation adjusted dollars. What if no one bought it?
Be thankful early adopters exist 'bro'.

Anyone smart enough to see the big picture is buying bitcoin.

But you want others to work and make you rich right? This subreddit has become a spawning ground for nihilism and it's killing this space. Go back to litecoin troll.

Gavin Andresen has been outclassed and his incompetence is beyond evident
1) Gavin involved in scam organization Bitcoin Foundation.
2) Gavin clueless to bitcoin economics.
3) Answers questions with "I feel good using it".
4) Nearly ended bitcoin in 2013.
5) Aligned himself with sleazebag Mike Hearn.
Gavin's libertarian utopian philosophy completely blinds him from using practical reason. This is precisely why he is unable to solve any problems. Gavin also has zero financial bearing on the ecosystem. How much money has Gavin raised in this space? zero. He was reliant on donations from criminals like Mark Karpeles through the 'Bitcoin Foundation'.
Gavin is bitter that he is no longer relevant in bitcoin.

People are becoming more aware of what is going on and are piling into bitcoin by the droves.

Bitcoin from a consumer payment point of view is a failure. Why are we still wasting time talking about it?
Bitpay falling apart sealed the deal with the viability of bitcoin as a consumer payment technology.
Let's move on and start improving real features like privacy.

One step towards over taking Paypal.

There is plenty of bitcoin to go around, people just need to pay for it. I'm sorry this isn't a get together of the poor.
