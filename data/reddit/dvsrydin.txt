Great idea!  A little bit of criticism if you don't mind.  It starts off strong, but then I think it gets a little unnecessarily fuzzy.  You can simplify it more by leaving out things such as mining.  Move that to a BTC 102 chart

Yeah I'd say if you had 350 of em, you could retire.

Lol yup this is me

Send them my way and I'll check it out. Pm for address

I think this is based on the USDT / bitfinex news and not related
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:51:05
You know there are other places in the world besides where you live right?
@_date: 2019-04-20 06:55:20
Well count yourself lucky they didn't take any funds

One time purchase of $100-200 for a wallet, or monthly fee of $5-25 forever for a bank account.   What makes more sense?
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:18:13
I'd say once hardware wallets are more mainstream the cost can be reduced to $10-20.  They really aren't very tech heavy

Fair enough, however, I'm willing to bet that most people aren't using totally free accounts. 
Next question ...you support banks or crypto?
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:00:29
I truly view this as being at the same point of the 'here is how to use email from 1980', or whatever it was.  Private keys will become an abstract concept vastly improving the usability of crypto in daily lives. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:34:10
I think there will be ways that the private key is improved on and easier to keep safe.  
As far as theft goes, there could be smart contracts where to keep your funds etc, multiple Walets and other methods to disperse, secure, hide , all of your funds.

Do you actually think posting this in 3+ subreddits is useful for anyone? 
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:25:51
Little confused. If I bought BTC at 9k, and it dropped 20%, I get that it needs to go up by 25% to be even back at 9k.  Why is there the 3rd column? What does BTC going up to 11250 have to do with anything
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:48:48
That wasn't really funny
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:29:23
Gotcha.  Ok thanks.  Good chart! 
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:43:56
These same words were spoken mid-2017.
How do you avoid thinking that BTC will never drop below 3k again?
