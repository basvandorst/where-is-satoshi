$30 in BTC when transactions cost $20. Feels bad man.

Invest in Lamborghini and Tesla. They're fueled by crypto money.

Unless you want traders to trade against it, and then do the exact opposite.

Big if true.

If you ever used the bot that tags t_d posters, you'll see *a lot* of them coming to the crypto subreddits and posting there. And as soon as politics come up in a thread, you'll see it going down with mindboggling crazy viewpoints.

You've opened my eyes. Looking back, it seems silly not a use a 3D pyramid moving into the 4th dimension as a BTC price indicator.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:46:00
I'm rather new as well. But of all the dozen exchanges mentioned, BitFlyer never crossed my radar. Guess the only asian exchanges you hear about on reddit are binance and kucoin.

The "oligarchy" isn't limited to one group. Are the Clintons part of an oligarchy? Sure. Are most of the Senators and people in Congress part of the oligarchy? Sure. Is Trump and his entourage part of an oligarchy. Duh.  
  
The world isn't black and white. Just because one side is bad doesn't make the other good. Get money out of politics and drain the swamp for real.
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:24:21


  
That's not true. I have never touched USDT. Maybe on Bitfinex and other platforms, but I'm either buying coins with fiat or trading them on binance.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:55:03
Could be, but if that were the case, then *lots* of other orders would've been canceled as well. Besides, they profit from people holding and dealing with bitcoins on their platform. Not selling them bitcoins is the last thing they want to happen.

Or we can drop the whataboutism and just call America a shitty oligarchy.

Wait, at which step did I expose my private key?
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:35:40
I have literally never heard of them. Not even on reddit...
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:24:04
So I guess it's more around $10 to $15. Still way too high for a $30 order.  
  
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:19:02
Well, I can't, but Americans should. Americans should also get off their asses and get Trump out of office.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:14:21
So around 3.2 * 10^12 dogeactions per second?!

That's just one aspect of it. There's so much more possible, though. One of my favorite features is the trust less aspects of contracts... and the concept of zero-knowledge proofs.  
  
Too tired to go into them atm, but look them up. Very cool concepts with a lot of potential for various applications.

Or a humble person that can reflect on himself.

ITT people gullible enough to not recognize this as satire.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:04:16
Oh, ok. So it's more of a wallet issue than a blockchain issue. If I used a hardware or paper wallet, I should be fine keeping my original wallet / private key, though, right?
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:02:38
You should familiarize yourself with the terms and concepts of a wallet, a public key, and private key. The Ledger is nothing more than a private key generator. The private key is used to generate a public key and to sign transactions. Send bitcoin and other towns to the public key of your ledger nano.   
  
Here's a quick video about connecting the ledger...

Yeah, I can't wait to get hacked by quantum computers!
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:46:14
Wut? They just canceled and refunded a transaction. That can happen at any store, at any time.
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:48:47
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:57:50
Of course it's the wallet. It's the address to your mailbox. Your private key (or word seed) unlocks the mailbox.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:36:44
It's not a peak until it goes down. Buying at $8k back at the start of December would've been an ATH as well...
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:46:43
Yeah  passphrases are universal. They're just a fancy way of encoding a private key.

Ugh, free money, how annoying...  
  
Move your coins to coinbase if you don't want forked coins.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:59:57
You can buy coins on the street with cash and then trade them anonymously.
