Yeah, let's ban alcohol as well.  Let's make everything that has ever enabled people with poor decision making skills to ruin their life illegal while we're at it.
Life is what you make it.  If someone wants to sit around stoned all day with no drive to their life, people as a whole should not suffer.  If someone has so little drive in life that smoking pot is ruining their lives, I don't think it's the pot they need to worry about.
We need to stop banning things because people can't get their lives together.  There's over 7 billion people on earth and the harsh truth is that nobody cares about anyone's addiction unless they are involved in their lives directly - and nobody should.  Why should you or I bear the burden of someone's life drama because they decide to drink all day, smoke meth or do anything else harmful to their bodies? We shouldn't.  Pump yourself full of garbage and waste your life and/or die - I have my own issues to deal with and my own choices to make.  If you can't stop putting bullshit into your body, you die, and that's the path you choose - too fucking bad for you.  If society doesn't feel the positives from your achievements, why in the hell should we suffer from your negatives?
Mankind as a whole should not suffer the consequences of an individual too stupid to realize moderation.
And before people start jumping at me calling me a pothead, I can't stand marijuana - it's never even remotely enjoyable.  But at the same time I think other people should be given both the access and responsibility to assess if it is for them or not.

I'm Canadian so my opinion is based of a different financial structure.  I don't believe it should be any different for these people. Those services are there for all in the time of health needs regardless and should treat people even if their own poor decision making causes them to be there.   Those people pay into the system when applicable so should reap the benefits offered.  Does it tip the scale overall in their favor financially?  Probably, but it's what is fair.
tl;dr - Don't expect me to care that you destroyed your life random stranger, but you should be entitled to the same health care benefits the rest of us have.

Where does one draw the line between 'victim' and 'bad business venture'.  As soon as shit goes south you're now a victim?
Uber offers a platform with many users to connect to someone who is willing to drive.  They take a 20% cut of fees for being a contractor under their name and having full benefit of their infrastructure.  If there is not enough popularity in the area to guarantee a driver (who is not obligated to drive for Uber at any time) profit for their time, how is Uber victimizing them.  They are free to stop and never continue again if they identify that they are not making money.  If you continue to drive for Uber at a knowing loss, you're a victim of your own lack of common sense.
Hell, apply that to bitcoin.  When popularity surged and the price went over $1k people flocked to buy mining rigs that they likely took a net loss on because the market became saturated and block hashrates went through the roof.  Who's victimizing them, the bitcoin community?
You can't step into a supply and demand based free business model and start whining when the variables don't stack in your favor.  Shit happens, and I feel bad if drivers cannot make money in certain markets, but nobody is victimizing anyone here.
@_date: 2015-07-26 00:17:00
Uber should not be looked at as a full time job.  It's always been a part time gig unless you live in a population dense area.
They **are** independent contractors.  If someone is making a loss driving for Uber, they should stop driving.  It's not like it's a full time job where they're expected to show up.
@_date: 2015-07-25 19:49:26
These drivers are on the fast track to getting fired. They're undermining the very principles that keep Uber as a strong market player.

Coinbase has some serious issues to work out.  I signed up and verified and was credited, had someone from a forum or from sign up under me and verify and was credited for that.  Less than 2 hours later the referral .10btc disappeared for no reason.  After that I went to send the remaining .10btc to a wallet, the website wouldn't process the transaction, sent me a message about how the transaction never entered the blockchain and to try again.  This time the initial .10 was gone also.
Wouldn't trust these guys with wallet storage in current form... at all.

I called him out for stating what he did on the basis that he has no facebook therefore bitcoin users don't have facebook accounts.

I never said it was anonymous.  I said involving the FBI with bitcoin related issues is an empty threat.  I applaud your reading skills, they are of a second grade level.
There's also quite a few holes in your theory that you could trace someone to cashout.  Have you thought about laundering it through poker sites?  If I were to steal bitcoins, upload them to a poker site and make a withdrawl with another set of accounts in smaller increments, you would have no idea without a subpoena against the site to release the information for the individual transactions.  Laundering bitcoin is incredibly easy since you can create wallets with no base ID behind them.  I'm not exactly sure you know what you're talking about.

How am I being petty?  You're under the assumption that people who use bitcoin on average are worried about privacy and anonymity to the point where they don't have facebook accounts?  Most users of bitcoin are average people who have adopted it as an alternative payment for some services they use online.
Sure maybe the people who directly go to bitcoin for the anonymity of it, but at the same time I'm not quite sure all people who use bitcoin are using it for silkroad or other things they want to keep hidden.

6850 will do about 255mh/s - that's roughly 0.17 BTC in a full 24h.
With bitcoin being at about 4.30USD/BTC right now give or take, you'd be making the equivalent of about 73 cents per 24 hours a consistently full load is put on your GPU.  Then there's the power draw and cost from that.  It's fun to play poker with or whatever, and you can make gains, but long term that's a lot of stress on your system and you're almost guaranteed to come out with a loss over power consumption.
It would honestly be worth your time to do an hour's work for a friend/family member/anyone for 5-10 bucks and use that to purchase bitcoin, it would also help the community much more than mining at this point.
@_date: 2012-01-04 12:02:28
It's either get the bitcoin money deposited into your bank and claim it on your taxes, which at the end of the year is more taxes paid ... Or do it my way and you save being taxed on that income since you buy essential items with the gift cards, saving the cash you would have spent on those items anyway, leaving you with leftover cash that you don't have to pay tax on.
Either way you're being taxed on your income.  This just avoids you being taxed on the bitcoin income.

Before you get into bitcoin, you need to be 100% cool with having your money disappear if the price plummets as it regularly does.  You also need to take everything overly positive that people say with a grain of salt because these people have investments in bitcoin and are always trying to rally up publicity and get people investing to get their investments back, allowing them to dump them at cost and fuck over everyone else.
@_date: 2012-08-08 21:17:49
This is the best answer.  Do not listen to anyone who tries to convince you that Bitcoin is some all powerful currency that's gaining massive momentum and is going to take over the world.  It's a semi-popular alternative online currency with a lot of enemies.  People tend to get too invested and excited about bitcoin and their comments are usually fuelled by greed and the hope for their investments to gain popularity, so they try to hype bitcoin at every turn.  I tried to tell people last summer when they were dumping their life savings into bitcoin when it peaked, but some people just don't listen and I saw people lose insane amounts of money when it plummeted.

Just avoid paypal altogether.  They always rule in favor of the buyer with the sob story and no proof, and expect the seller to cough up insane amounts of proof.
No solid proof of delivery = chargeback complete.  People do it daily to people who sell high end goods and forget to get delivery confirmation.  eBay has turned into a joke.
The one time I got screwed by a seller on eBay, after fighting with paypal to win the dispute, I got this in my email:










All this from a company with ads plastered everywhere on eBay offering 100% guaranteed consumer protection.

Paypal did not abuse them.  If they had read the actual agreement when they started taking donations, they wouldn't be in this mess.   I dislike paypal as much as the next guy, but this shit is getting ridiculous.

Because everyone's getting sick of bitcoin being mentioned when anything goes wrong with anything.  Nobody is willing to put money into a new currency that's seen insane high/lows this year.
People need to start mentioning it where its needed, and to stop spamming it as an end-all solution to all issues.  Hell the paypal issue was because they used a donate button, which *clearly states *when you generate it it has to be for a non-profit organization.

That's different, that's legal tender in a centralized system.  Bitcoin and US banks are nothing alike.
Bitcoing is decentralized, why is everyone so happy to use bitcoin because it's decentralized (yeah fuck the man! etc) but as soon as they make an irreversible mistake, they seem to want everything that comes with centralization?

They *have* made dubstep tracks, but their focus is not dubstep.  You can't call them a dubstep group, nor can you call them drumstep because of one remix they've done.
