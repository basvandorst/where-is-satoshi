Thank you for the constructive reply. That hard fork is raising those Block sizes from 1MB to 2MB (the 2X part of the Segwit2X), am I right?

Please, read the whole post once again. You are obviously missing the point.

I am posting things that a related to the real time problem. I know, as a BTC holder it can easily trigger you when someone is poiting out negative things.
In this post I am looking for answers to my question and not for a 6 lines long post from a douche acting like he has all the intelligence of the universe.
Some people pointed out the facts about fees and their reduction in the future by upcoming forks &amp; lightning network. And that is what I was looking for, not for some kind of your personal outbursts written in 6 lines (which are completely worthless to me and won´t help anybody). Maybe you have a fucked up day, but I don´t, so please, don´t ruin it for me...

Thank you for your reply. I haven´t heard about the Lightning Network yet, but I have seen some posts now. I was also reading about the 2X part of the Segwit2X. Is there going the be a new hard fork again? :O
