Why is it to late?  AIPAC successfully lobbies all congress on behalf of Israel with only $100 million a year.. and a lot of passionate volunteers.  How big is the bitcoin community?  We could all pitch in and start donating to law makers and come up with policy..

Buying congress would be a good start, the problem would be you would likely have banks lobbying against all our bills, depends how much we paid.
I still see no technology that will allow bitcoin to overcome the gun of the state.
They can say the exchange of btc is a felony punishable by $100k fine and up to 25 years in prison.  Who on earth is going to risk exchanging bitcoin then?  Or what if they just forbid the banks to exchange it under a revised BSA.
So then you start borrowing and lending dollars using bitcoin as collateral and they ban that, or don't allow the banks to transact in it.
I feel like it's just being toyed with around the edges, we should unite and build relationships with our law makers before they drop the hammer.  Get them on the bitcoin train and we can make a satoshi par with a dollar ��!

Can't download money for free, very different.  Songs and movies are a few billion a year in business.  Bitcoin is rivaling the state and hundreds of trillions in currency backed by the most guns on earth.

Grease the wheels, hard to pass up sizable donations with reasonable and legitimate policy recommendations.  It would have to be completely bipartisan.  Could start a committee, solicit donations from bitcoin investors and hire a few savvy k street lobbyists to help make the introductions.  Even hire a political director and have an annual D.C. conference.  At the end of he conference we can over etiquette, and discuss new bills we want passed to all the conference members who then go out to all the congressmen asking them to sign onto the bills.  Far more effective than paying people to do it.  We have to frame all the good it is doing for the world and for America.  Everyone in suites, keep it professional and on the talking points.  
I realize it's very off putting to engage governments for some in this space but I see it as an absolute necessity in order for btc to grow out of obscurity.
We could force regulators to accurately define what bitcoin is, we could have a say in that choice.  We could make bitcoin money that we could pay taxes on.  We could build tools for blochain analysis available for regulators with a warrant.  We could have cooperation with law enforcement catching bitcoin thieves.  We could get mainstream acceptance for bitcoin for products and labor.  We could define money transmitting and get banks to work with bitcoin.  laws that define what is required and what isn't to keep the unfortunate from being made examples of with laws that are not accurately defined.  We could have a satoshi worth a dollar one day!

It doesn't, dollars are difficult to get into Venezuela, bitcoin is easy.  Instead of Americans sending dollars they can send bitcoin and they can use bitcoin as currency instead.

What wallets do you use or suggest?  Archbit, Mycelium, Electrum?  And why do you recommend them?  I'm still using a few and would like to settle on one.  Haven't tried Electrum or Mycelium yet.

I don't know why people are not more concerned about regulation.  Maybe I'm missing something but I've put a lot of thought into this and come up with the same conclusions.  If bitcoin starts getting a sizable market share I don't see how BIS, IMF, and the G20 nations don't hold conferences and coordinate legislation in multiple nations banning the exchanges using anti terrorism and money laundering as the excuse (spare me the comments of the dollar being used for those things, in not saying it's a legitimate excuse).
The other avenue for governments or banks (agents of governments) to take would be to buy up large sums of bitcoins on the OTC markets and sell them on the exchanges during illiquid trading hours as it has been proven banks to do with the silver market.
Either way if governments have succeeded in suppressing the global gold and silver markets to prop up currencies I don't see why they can't do the same to our tiny market.
I'm not sure if anyone is doing it at the moment but I think our community should be engaging law makers in the US congress as with other countries and donating to them in bitcoin.  Get law makers invested in the system and they will be championing its success.

This is totally off topic but I think that aid isn't for Israel to protect just against Palestine, I think it's also to protect a friendly in he area against unfriendlies like Syria, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, etc, etc.

That's what I said, regulate the exchange, make it illegal or impossible and you prevent people from going in and out of currencies, reducing the value of bitcoin.  They can also regulate or ban the use of bitcoin of purchasing, if the penalty is steep enough it would drive bitcoin way underground and reduce its value.
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:07:41
Except that governments have a gun to our heads forcing us to pay our taxes in their currencies.  Not to mention there is no serious acceptance of bitcoin for goods and services.

The effort of implementing ideas is almost always more valuable than the ideas themselves.  The market pays for results.
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:28:38
They can't stop the blockchain or the idea of a blockchain but they could hurt bitcoin, its growth, its development.  If you can't use an exchange and you can't use bitcoin for real purchases it will slow the growth.
