It's the fault of Congress, essentially.
Companies are worried about getting pinched by the government. If \*customers use Bitcoin (\* in transactions involving their bank accounts) to evade taxes the banks will get fined. JP Morgan faced fines unrelated to Bitcoin, but related to money laundering, a few weeks ago. It's a real thing, and it's a real problem for banks.
Fines derive, ultimately, from legislation. And such legislation comes from Congress. Want something done? Contact your US Congressmen.

We, the intellectuals, will reserve judgment, and will investigate whether or not it is indeed malice.
Out of the woodwork, so many? What are the odds. How many emerge to defend suspect actions - why? Why not just look into it. Nothing is more suspicious than highly suspicious actions being met with a call to ignore them. Very creepy. That's a really creepy thing.

Describe what fraud is.
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:06:55
The JP Morgan document itself offers as an alternative to Bitcoin gold. They are connected, according to their experts. Others will also connect them. When people are hedging against inflation they have choices to make, and both Bitcoin and gold are options. This means that actual investors (many) make a choice between, and regarding a mix of, Bitcoin and gold.
This suffices.
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:04:08
He said Bitcoin is a "fraud."
    the requisite elements of fraud as a tort generally are the intentional misrepresentation or concealment of an important fact upon which the victim is meant to rely, and in fact does rely, to the harm of the victim.
Needless to say, that's 100% false. All of the facts are readily accessed, the code, the whole blockchain. Bitcoin is not a "fraud." Therefore Dimon DID make a false statement.
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:45:57

This is exceptional information!
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:09:19
He falsely claimed Bitcoin is a "fraud." The legal definition of a fraud includes the idea of some crucial information which is withheld from the investor. No information is withheld from the investor in Bitcoin. That is the meaning of alleging "fraud," withheld critical info. I guarantee you Dimon knows what "fraud" means, and he would be expected to know this, and so the real question is "will the CFTC be brave enough to take on Mr. Moneybags?"
@_date: 2017-09-24 09:15:35
It's not about correlation. It's about a connection. Connection = trouble zone. Obviously, it's because someone might think to cause an effect. But the effect need not actually exist. There's a very good reason for this, which you are illustrating in spades, which is that this argument could continue for ages. Therefore, the standard is connection, not causation. See the cfr.

Don't let that shill get you down. We've got Mr. Dimon on the hook for this one, and we can't stop yappin' for him to get nailed by the CFTC on it. We must set a precedent that you cannot LIE about Bitcoin. Dimon LIED and said Bitcoin is a fraud. Fraud=crucial info withheld from investors. No info is withheld from investors. Even if the CFTC doesn't want to protect Bitcoin, they will want to protect gold from manipulation, and lying about Bitcoin would manipulate gold (gold and bitcoin are "connect[ed]" somewhat, and that's enough for this to apply, for certain).

Well, Bitcoin certainly tends to affect gold prices, and JPMorgan is certainly involved in gold. More is said about gold, in the JPMorgan screed that followed up Dimon's comments. If Dimon was wrong, and did not make the error in good faith, then he's afoul of the regulation. But is the CFTC really an honest agency? This seems doubtful...

Respect for property rights doesn't exist among Democrats or their equivalent Communist-by-another-name parties in various countries. They believe they know best, and seek to redistribute. Communism is rising in popularity, and the foreigner is the first to be targeted. For an example of how this is playing out, look at how Australians are eyeing Chinese property as a potential source of homeless housing. When those sickos want something they'll steal it, and Communism is growing by leaps and bounds.

That may be true, but that would not constitute fraud:

It wouldn't constitute an intentional misrepresentation, and it is definitely not concealment (the code is published). Furthermore, that's not something on which one relies.

Yep, it is. It might not be a causal relationship, but the rule doesn't require it. Gold being traded by JPMorgan is sufficient. He's run afoul of the rule. (Explaining: Gold has a relationship which could be measured, interacting with Bitcoin, if you could know all other variables. Its impact is not routinely seen. It doesn't even matter if it would have been practical to cause an effect on gold via attacking Bitcoin. Alone is it sufficient that among the things connected to gold is Bitcoin.)
