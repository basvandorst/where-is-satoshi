Does nobody see the shocking similarity between now and *exactly* 4 years ago. At the end of the year there was a big spike, a drop, a nearly complete rebound before falling off. 
Everybody is so incredibly absolutely sure that the only possible outcome from this is back up. So damn sure it must be a "correction" because that's what it looks like, even though the last time this exact thing happened it died and took 4 years of stagnation to recover.

While the other guy is clearly pushing terrible investing advice, I happen to know a successful bitcoin day trader. His full time job is to predict higher and lows. Nobody can do it perfectly, but if you get it right 51% of the time then you can make a lot of money.

That's fine, no argument there, but why is everyone acting like we're almost guaranteed to see 20k in a month when the best historical example of this kind of movement took 48 times longer?

I have a feeling that enough people in the government know that "banning" it isn't really possible. 4chan alone has had enough brain power behind it to organize against major institutions. And look at torrents. Literally illegal file sharing that could never have been stopped.
Banning cryptocurrency is going to hurt the US economy much more than it's going to hurt the cryptocurrency long term. Especially since banning it will require efforts beyond what failed to eliminate torrents and child porn. They would have to go full China with it, making all sorts of services illegal and locking the people out of the free internet. A blatant violation of the constitution.

Your opinion will be very underrated here. Bitcoin has rocketed up from nothing against the intuition and expectations of so many "wise investors" since its birth. It is a perfect example of how emerging technologies cannot be so easily understood and predicted, and how the status quo can turn inside out in a hurry.
Still you will have a bunch of "wise investors" here explaining how altcoins couldn't end up on top of bitcoin; how bitcoin failing or hitting a permanent ceiling this low simply isn't possible; how holding on tight with your eyes closed guarantees success long-term.
And what's the chance that they're wrong? What's the chance that a surge in cryptocurrency provides more diverse trading in altcoins, ultimately subtracting value from bitcoin (permanently)? Well, probably as likely as bitcoin becoming an asset in the first place.

I don't think SpongeBob is a good source of financial advice. If we're just talking about changing technologies and being optimistic about the future innovation, then "IMAGINATION" is good fun. But please, try to keep economics grounded in more cautiously realistic ideas.

As far as I am concerned, cryptocurrencies are just like cash currencies in the sense that they are for whatever the hell I want to do with them.
There's lots of people who trade foreign exchange, and I could preach all day about how Fiat currencies aren't for investing or trading. But they are if you do it and so is bitcoin.

Sounds like semantics. Let's just start from the beginning but replace "internet" with "web" in my argument. I don't think we fundamentally disagree. I think it's in the logic that leads to our conclusions. 
In any case, the revolutionary effects of the internet are immeasurable. The number of technologies and the globalization of information that it allowed as well as the access to the most important and influential thing in human civilization - education - all combine to put it up there with fire and the wheel.
Money is in everything, but changing how it works doesn't change what we do with it. We buy things and sell things and trade it. Even making money electronic was just a convenience factor for the majority of people, and that's probably the most significant change in money to ever happen since it was created by the first mints.

Whoa, bro! You were doing great here until you implied that bitcoin isn't the permanent, eternal ruler of all trade and bartering for the remainder of human existence.
You need to be more careful, unless you're looking for downvotes.

Damn right. Even as a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is a first iteration and isn't really ideal. Don't get me wrong, Bitcoin is awesome and works great, but the variables chosen for how it works didn't matter as much when it was created as a hobby project. Now we have coins that seem a lot more sane as a real currency. Even Dogecoin has strong arguments for why it's a better choice for large scale adoption (although I'm not drawing that conclusion here).

The log scale isn't inappropriate for analysis. It is, however, being misused to make bitcoin's history look different to people who aren't willing to examine the chart more closely. In other words, people on reddit who will see this.
This is classic misinformation tactics. Used all the time, especially in politics, to deliver facts that teach people lies. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:23:34
I think it's incredibly unfair to call the beginning of the internet when the concept was first designed. Are we going to call the beginning of the automobile when the first steam locomotive was built? You're picking convenient logic, not appropriate logic.
Note that I gave bitcoin a good, what, two year head start? That's because I don't consider the obscure hobby program invented by some anonymous guy to be a relevant technology. Just like some wires and a simple means of transferring data over them isn't the internet.

I don't think an emergency fund needs to afford home additions or other large purchases. A few months pay and a pricey ER visit seems fine for "emergency".
What class of wealth are you in when you're expected to have thousands of dollars on hand to pay for things like home additions and hot tubs?

This is so depressing. I'm going back to where it doesn't matter what happens.

Let's ignore the idealogical points, because people tend to project their importance onto way too many other people who actually don't care. Let's stick with practical benefits and list what bitcoin will change about people's lives:
* Faster money transfers
* No need to change foreign currencies
* Maybe I am missing something else?
I love bitcoin and I want everyone else to also, but it's not going to change my life on any level that resembles the internet and the digital revolution that came with it. By internet standards, Bitcoin is a bust so far. It's been 5 years and it's barely even showing up in our day to day economy.
Let's say 2013 was the start of bitcoin as more than a hobby, and 1985 was the start of the internet as a service available to ordinary people. By 1990 the internet had blown up to connect a hundred differe countries and was already in place as a standard means of communication in the professional world. Online shopping already existed. I could, without a single word spoken or written, pay for a product and have it brought to my house for me in just five years after AOL was founded.
Let's not pretend that bitcoin could *ever* be in the same league as the internet or cell phones, which sparked a technology revolution that includes bitcoin itself. It's just a means of transferring money.

Whatever you do, don't use market data to predict the bottom of a fall, then sell, and finally buy back when nearing said bottom. Doing this has never benefitted anyone, ever. You need to just hodl until everything is better.
