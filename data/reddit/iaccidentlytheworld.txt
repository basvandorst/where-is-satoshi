True, but the timing lag is what people have the biggest issue with.  "Oh it's over 10k now?  yea we'll refund at 800/coin"

He doesn't need to.  He has spoken on it before, and i don't get why people pin it on him.  Karpeles was the one who downed it

Yea i mean it was completely new territory.  Whoever's fault it was lost me 2BTC back then so I'm not absolving everyone, just pointing out that it's not all on Jed

Losing exchange liquidity sucks in the short-term, but if the ultimate "long" play for a crypto-based economy comes to fruition, you'd just exchange your crypto for goods/services either way.  I know that people / places accepting BTC today typically exchange it to USD relatively quickly, however it might not always be that way. 
And yeah anecdotally I have used crypto for freelance services abroad at a discount.

Better look at 12/10 then too

That's idiotic man, most bitcoin guys I know still work in their careers and live simply off their bitcoin wealth.  Low profile people.  The loudest ones usually have the least.

Good call, there's not enough bitcoin money floating around the bay area!
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:52:32
There's nothing concrete. But if the BCH is available to sell on coinbase, then the answer obviously is that it will go down. The thing is that it's gonna down, it always goes down…because of the implication.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:34:06
I could make you a very very happy person :)

Liquidity perhaps?  I'm not sure how the volumes currently stack, but XMR is a larger base

Yea but the average joseph sure would
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:45:05
People here fundamentally just don't understand that "sell walls" aren't fixed points, they are adjusted on the fly by traders.  We get past that and wow people take note and set their own at 17.5, then 18, etc.  The 20s sit out there because people want to catch a lofty spike up to an astronomical price.  
@_date: 2018-05-04 19:54:32

@_date: 2018-03-16 14:52:43
It's almost impossible to nail down the top, but mania is pretty easy to recognize and if you sell in intervals along the way up, you typically end up being able to buy back the original amounts with profit to spare.

Fair point actually.  I guess we need to figure out what the gov and banks want to call digital assets and coins.

It sounds like you lack executive function.  You should really work on your mindset and set goals for yourself or your life will go off the rails.

People watch the gox trustee address and sell with it as well
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:51:11
I suppose

It literally could act as a cash advance.  I could buy 1000 worth of BTC on my card and have it sold and transferred to my bank in like a day

I bought myself a Maserati when I was 22.  It was stupid.
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:31:02
I remember when it jumped 12-17 in like 30 minutes.  Sold 50% of my BTC between 16-17 on the way up.  Bought the original coins back at 8ish, and pocketed the profits.  Any growth like that is frenzy.  Did similar when XLM ran to .95

That's not what i implied at all... there would be a lot of USDT bag holders, but their coins would then be worthless.  How does that affect the price of BTC?  
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:11:49
If tether went insolvent, an exchange like bittrex would probably just suspend USDT to USD trading...

If he isn't able to quantify it via statistics, what would you prefer he says?  
"I believe that Nick Szabo is Satoshi."
If he said that you'd probably say "Why do you think that?  What empirical evidence do you have?  You're being intellectually misleading."
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:25:16
Why would anyone need to do that?

This is spot on.  I know people who have bought and sold luxury vehicles for nearly the same price.  I did it with a gsxr1000 which is a smaller scale but same principle.
Plus, if you have enough for a lambo, it's not like you don't also have traditional investments...  For millionaires, it's really not a big deal...

Everyone here so far is wrong.  They are reading it as the 165,000 being dumped to the market.  
If they were burned, the price would pop up (not sure %s).

I get where you're coming from with this.... but seriously?  Seriously?  Like really?  
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:14:26
I think there are several valuable alts that haven't been performing as well as BTC.  I think it's a lag, and they'll surge again, but nobody really knows.  That's why you hold the majority in BTC/ETH and "diversify" into a few riskier picks
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:40:36
Completely agree, if he was serious about buying back in a big way he could ramp up some momentum with strategic buys and fake buy orders (posturing) but it is very risky.

Most tourists savvy enough to use BTC also currently "churn" to get the most possible value out of the current credit ecosystem.

And plenty of people have lost their private keys, what's your point?
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:26:57
I can't blame them because investing is fundamentally different from speculation (which is what stage we're still in). 
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:31:48
It's all relative.  To an average joe, losing ~1M ($3M at peak) is insane.  If you're making 100k/year it would take you 30 years to gross that much money.  
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:53:13
Do current mining predictions take into account advancements in computing and popularity of crypto?  
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:40:23
Most people used dat files on external hard drives and paper and things.  There were wallets.  A lot of early miners foolishly didn't treat it as real money back then (myself included), and didn't mind storing it on "the exchange."  I only lost 22BTC, I know guys who lost 10x that much through gox and just plain negligence.

Nothing about that means Jed isn't trustworthy, it just means that the risk was being exploited before Mark took over. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:45:10
If he spent $15000 on BTC at $100 that's 150 coins... That's a lot.  That's $1M today.
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:42:45
Aka if the mining benefit stops outweighing the cost.  I don't see it happening because the mining consortiums still have plenty of money they can squeeze out of this
