HODLers are the exact opposite to a traders dream. Weak baby hands are what they want, which unfortunately accounts for around half of crypto ‘investors’

Why is this constantly posted when it’s absolutely false. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:29:02
No surprise

Out of interest, which coins do you have faith in for the future of cryptocurrency?

He was actually up to 300. I feel for the kid, must have felt invincible at the time.

You’ve instantly lost the arguement when you get that emotional. Both seem like complete morons, nothing to see.

My opinion is that slowly BTC will drop and the deserving ‘2.0’ projects will rise and become independent of bitcoin in the markets. Not to raise FUD, but I sold all BTC and haven’t looked back.

This has the makings of a Looper-style sci-fi, with IRS accountants hunting down time travelling nerds trying to invest. IMDB 9.4/10
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:19:39
To the point haha
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:05:02
Can’t wait for that bottom right now...
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:02:27
Use GDAX?...

No way would a major media outlet get anyone in that actually knows about crypto. That’d be ridiculous of course.

All in

Get read to HODL the door boys!

Another weak hand, nothing to see here. And to be honest for people like you, I genuinely recommend selling it all too. 
P.S. your stance isn’t uncommon, it’s mundanely common. But you’ll all be back at the tip of the next bull, so until then.

Goodbye. Hope you enjoyed your 4 full weeks of trading.

Pump and dump back to normality. Ask yourself why else would Btrash take off against the grain. Be warned.

We’ve got eachother

It’s actually the same poster over, and over again. Seriously.
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:39:41
Time stamps would be great...
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:01:30
How many times are you going to post this, and for what purpose? Where the hell are the mods?!
