I disagree.  If we can absorb 20k+ coins then rebound, we shouldn't need to worry about the impact of 1 holder dumping all their coins.  Which for me, was a concern previously.  We can see that the demand for these coins is there and people will buy them.  I think this makes the coins undervalued overall, because people were too busy panicking about the price drop to see that it was actually an awesome thing that 20k coins would be bought so quickly.  20k coins is a huge amount btw, you are talking about more than 1/1000th of the total number of coins.  To be able to move all that in 1 day is crazy.

Well, its not truly digitizing DNA.  Its like all the other services like 23andme, where they only sample genes that we know/think actually do something, where the vast majority of DNA is ignored.  Its not even close to a complete picture of what is you.  This is why they only charge 99 dollars, and based on what they say they offer in their tagline, it does sound a bit scammy if you don't understand how it works.
edit: Actually reading through the site they don't make it clear if its whole sequencing or sampling, but they link to a wiki article on complete sequencing.  Which at 1350 dollars+more for genecoins cut for a full sequence, seems kind of pointless and I don't see many people going for it... but whatever.

Yes, I bought 5 last year while everyone was panicking and sold a few months later for 1000ish profit.  I will wait for the "top" of the next hype wave before I sell these 5 I just picked up.  I am thinking the beginning of january bitcoin will peak again, maybe not as high as last year, but way higher than the 300 each I paid. I won't ever sell at a loss though.  I consider it money gone at that point and hope it recovers in months/years.

I remember like 3-4 years ago someone was leaving bitcoin wallets lying around in my city.  I remember seeing one and just thought it was trash/a joke.  It makes me wonder how much was on them = (

Yes, but can't say when it might reach this.  I bought 5 coins when it hit rock bottom and will be holding until at least 500-600 which I expect it to hit again come the holidays, when people are talking about bitcoin with relatives.  Someone just dumped 20k coins and the price is trending back upwards.. amazing and have high hopes for the price.

Bought 5 more coins when everyone else was panicking already up 350 bucks.  Same thing every time, price dives, I buy more and it rebounds.  Don't buy after hype, buy after panic.  If you want to sell, do it when the hype is strong and don't sell when everyone else is panicking. 
 Long term (a few years) the value is much likely to be more than what you paid for it.  Even if a very superior crypto comes a long it would take so much energy to get people hooked, implement it into merchants, etc. that bitcoin would still hold out, just because it has so much advantage of being the center of attention for so long.  Plus any new crypto would be much more unstable because it wouldn't have the trust that people have in bitcoin.  People need to get away from the day to day prices and not let it affect them emotionally and force them to sell their coins.

Makes me wonder how many backend dev positions they will have though, indeed only says 1, because that seems like a lot of work for 1.5 devs (including dev lead).  You would basically be making your own cryptsy/coinbase backend for hot wallet/cold wallet management.  I definitely have the experience they ask but it makes me a little nervous not knowing the team size, and they are making the dev lead the scrum master and the product owner as well, so, yea.  To me all I see is "I'm going to run you as hard as a startup employee with no equity and pay you salary. It doesn't matter if you work 40 hours a week or 80+ hours a week, we pay you the same."

This was his plan all along. It sounds like a Southpark episode.

Ya this thread is full of the technically illerate. Hilarious considering the subreddit.

Scrypt based hashing moved to asics long ago, and no anyway. Speed of the memory wasn't the limiting factor, the size of the memory itself was.

So the article is full of shit because you still need a VPN and most decent ones aren't free.
