The basis of the value of the fiat currency is the use as a tax credit. There is a lot of use of the currency in the market because people work to get US Dollar to pay their taxes.
My argument is the difference between the US dollar land bitcoin is that the US dollar has a value in tax credits. Bitcoin has value because we give it value, the people. Is that not a shared reality? A shared illusion?

How about the new tax token currency. Would you see that it has value?
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:05:01
This is what gives a fiat currency created by a sovereign value. It always has been. Look at the British creating a hut tax.  the money is given value because of the hut tax.
If you disagree, maybe try to make a point instead of calling me an idiot.
If you can't make a point disputing my claims then, well, who is the idiot?

I was talking about taxes in what brings value to the US Dollar. The fact that you must pay your taxes in US Dollar gives the currency value. Whereas bitcoin has speculative value.
The transaction paying for the tax, is irrelevant, the end result is that US Currency has value because the US demands that currency in taxes.
@_date: 2019-07-14 06:03:56
Right, so the only difference between US Dollar and Bitcoin is the value that US dollar gets from acting as a tax credit where bitcoin does not.
@_date: 2019-07-14 05:34:27
I was speaking of what gives US Dollar value. It's a tax credit.
And converting bitcoin to USD to use to pay taxes isn't paying taxes in Bitcoin. It's converting and bitcoin into USD. After that you aren't using bitcoin.

If you live in the US I think the advantage would be clear. You can pay your tax!
If the government suddenly required taxes be paid in a new ABC fiat currency then the US Dollar would drop its value pretty fast, while everyone worked very hard to get some of the new ABC Currency. And the Dollar would die quickly.
Bitcoin has no value like this. That's a MASSIVE advantage for the Fiat currency.
@_date: 2019-07-14 02:54:01
Well, fiat US currency is made by the government, and is valued as tax credits. You can pay taxes owed to the US government in US Dollars. Bitcoin, no.

Again, if you disagree with me, make an argument and not an ad hominem attack.

Actually, an interesting quirk in the law.  Once you deposit the money with the bank, it's technically their money.  And they do with it what they please, like loaning it out to another customer.

Very misleading title.  The money wasn't "created out of thin air".  The money was stolen from NAB.  Their system may have not identified it correctly, however on the GL side of their business, they would have this debit entry, or if unable to trace it, a write off.

The article didn't say that it was un-noticed.  It said that the person committing the fraud was not found out.  ATM's do not create money, they dispense money.

How is public debt slavery? Public debt is the accounting record of money in your pocket. Public debt it private savings.

I am referring to a government that issues it's own currency. Like the USD, CAD, GBP, AUD, JPY, but obviously not something like the Euro. 
Also not talking about "printing" money. I am talking about governments that spend in their own currency, and require taxes to be paid in their own currency. I am referring to how government spending works. Governments (meeting the above condition of sovereignty over the currency) spend money into existence. They don't collect taxes to be able to spend, they simply spend by crediting an account with the amount of money.
International trade is a different thing, including floating your currency on international markets. IE, not like Hong Kong who pegs to the USD, creating a cost for themselves in another currency. 
The North Korean Won is a currency, without access to OPEC or SWIFT, but it is undeniably a currency. The DPRK has taxes (I believe mostly hidden sales taxes) to create some demand for / value in the currency, and the government can spend. But why would the government need to tax TO spend. 
What you reference in terms of inflation (dilute the value of each dollar) is a constraint of spending, IE you don't want to spend so much that the government pulls resources away from the private economy in any large way. For example if the US government was to start buying rebar and concrete to build a wall across the border with mexico I would assume the price of rebar and concrete would be going up dramatically for the private sector. That would be inflationary. The spending constraint is the risk of inflation, and not the tax that is "collected".
@_date: 2019-09-30 19:14:37
Exactly this!  So many people think governments need to tax so they have revenue to spend. Sigh.
@_date: 2019-09-30 20:18:19
Kinda proving my point here.
@_date: 2019-09-30 20:07:52
Taxes create demand for a sovereign's currency, and provide a way to control for inflation. But it's not like a government taxes to be able to have the money to spend. That's not how money works.

That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works. 
Who do you think gets that $220 billion dollars? Owners of the bonds. Those bond owners save or use those "interest" payments so that money is then used in the overall market. The only thing that makes money disappear is federal taxation, as that takes money out of the private economy and destroys it. 
If the central bank wanted to it could simply start purchasing bonds (see Japan), pushing the bond market lower and dramatically reducing interest "payments". My point is if you see the problem as the "interest" on the bonds is too high, then just lower the interest rate being paid. What are the owners of the bonds going to do? Move the money out of bonds and into reserve accounts? OK. Move the money out of bonds and into investments in businesses? Well that would be a pretty good thing.
The government debt is an accounting identity. A debt to offset the credit of money in the economy. The comparable way of talking about bitcoin is that the "Bitcoin" debt is currently at 17,700,000BTC. That's the accumulated debit entries for all the accumulated credit entries that occurred as a result of mining operations, yet nobody is saying that "Bitcoin" is going bankrupt.

Care to expand on that? I can plausibly see that in a deflationary currency people would only spend on absolute necessity and not frivolous items. Perhaps more accurately things that maintain their value in comparison to the currency? Or just things that are used in that instance, like food?
Regardless if a currency is inflationary or deflationary I think people would spend the currency on things they value. The iphone that lasts for 2 years is obviously something of value to many people so I find it hard to say that's a shit product. 
I think it's a false choice between spending money on a shit product or saving money and loosing value slowly over time as a result of inflation, but not really cause it's in a term deposit that pays higher than inflation. Are people really thinking in those terms? Or thinking about the comparison between spending money on an iphone vs some other thing of value at the time? 
A deflationary currency would also increase the real value of debts. So that mortgage you got to buy a house would cost more and more in real value over the life of the mortgage. This would limit the ability of new business to take on credit to expand their business. Would that not restrict the growth of the marketplace?

But one of the big values in Bitcoin is the transaction network. This is actually my problem trying to understand the value of the currency. If it's just a store of value then much of the benefits of the transaction network is lost. If the value in the transaction network is lost, will it retain it's worth as a store of value?
Forget the 2% per year loss on value of inflation, the visa or mastercard payment networks already cost something like 2%! I love that part of bitcoin but honestly think that attacking USD in comparison to BTC for inflation misses the best value of BTC as a transaction network.
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:46:25
I am a bit confused here. You start out saying that people have spent in deflationary currency through history and it's not an issue to the market, and end by saying that with inflationary currency people spend freely on goods. So if a currency is inflationary or deflationary it is irrelevant to the market?
Bank term deposits are currently paying a higher rate of return than the inflation rate which means your savings in the form of a bond will maintain it's value.
A small level of inflation also eases credit operations. If I buy a house now and take out a $1,000,000 30 year loan to pay for it, then the cumulative inflation over that time is about 80%. Assuming my wages increase at pace with inflation (admittedly not always a strong assumption), then the real cost of that mortgage over time is decreasing as my wages increase. 
I also don't understand why inflation would cause people to buy poor quality goods. If we were experiencing a high level of inflation I would try to purchase goods that retained their value so I could resell them in the future. Can you explain your thinking on this?

The first path would likely bring about a recession. The second path would not lead to rampant inflation, if you dispute this, please show your work.
The reality is this isn't a binary choice. The path I would select is this:
Let the debt continue to grow bigger, but have the central bank purchase the bonds at 0% interest or let private institutions purchase the bonds at a negative interest rate. Continue taxation at current rates, and if inflation starts to grow higher than 2% then start increasing taxation to reduce the money supply.
You say that the first path would be better for the value of the USD, what is your thinking there? 6 out of 7 of the last periods the government ran a surplus was followed by a depression. The last time was the Clinton years, which preceded the 2001 recession and ultimately contributing to the 2008-2009 "Great Recession".
Part of the value of the USD comes from it being used extensively as a medium of exchange, if there is less USD in the market, it becomes less able to be used as that medium.  Why not start using some Yuan then?  
Let's imagine a marketplace, with 10 stalls. The people who walk into the market place have a combined USD value of $500 in their pockets. The market can easily start transacting because there is lots of money available as a medium of exchange. Now let's say we increase taxes overnight and tax out half of the money. Now there is $250 in people's pockets and maybe the market still operates, but fewer transactions take place. Now repeat the taxation and open for the next day, and the next. The market will start grinding to a halt as nobody has the medium of exchange. 
A small amount of inflation is a good thing, because that pushes users of the currency to actually use the currency as a medium of exchange. In the above example, if the currency was worth more and more every day (deflationary) then why would the people in the market want to spend the money today, it will be worth more tomorrow. I would just hold onto the money. If there is some inflation then there is value in spending the money in my pocket. The currency is used as a medium of exchange.

It's unclear to me that 1 would be good in the long term, what are the long term negative effects of running a deficit if inflation is maintained at a lower levels?  Inflation should be the constraint on deficit spending not the size of the debt. 
And with 2 I repeat the question, what are the long term negative effects of running a deficit? The "debt" grows and that money is used in the economy to keep the economy moving effectively. 
When these bonds come due, and China or other US debt holders want to do something else with that money what are they going to do? They have a pile of USD. They have store credit in the US. All they can do is purchase goods made in the US, or re-purchase the bonds, or sell the bonds to others for some different asset. Either way, somebody has this USD, what are they going to do with it?

Yes, in the short term. But why would I buy it today? It will be cheaper tomorrow. And yet even cheaper the next day! Why spend money today that is worth more tomorrow, unless it is a necessity. Maybe instead of buying that orange with currency I will trade a banana for it. Now you need to have a double coincidence of wants to be able to have the market function. The usefulness of the currency as a medium of exchange is dramatically reduced. 
That lunch I bought in 2013 with bitcoin seemed cheap at the time, and I spent the bitcoin because the value to me was not in the lunch, but in the uniqueness of the activity. If I was looking out for my future I would not have bought that lunch because today I could by 100 lunches! 
Just as in hyperinflation, why keep the money if it's worth less tomorrow? Spend it on something else that I could then trade for what I might need tomorrow.
Predictable low levels of inflation help to lubricate the markets and keep them moving.
