Dude I'm not gonna get in a pissing match on income that you'll certainly lose (if all you've saved is 600k for where you are in your life). Yes, if you spend your entire life riding on your parents dime with "no marketable skills", you are pretty much the definition of welfare queen -- you just happen to be mooching off your parents instead of the government.
@_date: 2012-10-21 03:18:21
So troll confirmed then? I can't imagine a welfare queen would be this monumentally dense
@_date: 2012-10-21 04:23:46
Why do you think I'm trying to have a legitimate argument with you?
@_date: 2012-10-21 02:35:27
Dude from the description in the OP you are literally a welfare queen, what's with all the self-loathing?

Just because an accomplished scientist uses that phrase in one context doesn't mean you are right when you use it in this context.

Since you're a filmmaker, let me give you an analogy: Trading on an exchange written by a programmer who asks questions like in the OP is like investing money into a film and then hearing him ask "well, I took a bunch of pictures, how do I make them move?"
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:50:45
I don't know who you meant to reply but thats interesting i guess

Mt Gox isn't one person, and that's fucking pennies. Those capable work at actual professional exchanges. NASDAQ regularly makes more than half a million in fees from *me* personally (I work in HFT),  much less the rest of the trading world. Of course, NASDAQ isn't one person either, but if you're going to build an exchange you don't care what it trades, so you'd rather make in whatever will make you the most money, and that ain't BTC.
Edit: Also, lol, do you seriously think Bill Gates is the *only* programmer that gets paid 6m+ per year? Really?

The first result for googling "confounding".

Nothing is stopping you from starting another equity exchange, the only thing that might be stopping more exchanges from opening is the inability to generate enough volume to pay infrastructure costs. Nothing is stopping you from exchanging your stocks with someone else personally off-exchange, either. Do you not know anything about financial markets outside bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:03:46
What people are trying to say is that with someone with this level of skill, there will *always* be an unacceptable amount of risk in trading on an exchange written by this person.
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:46:19
and so is the compensation you can receive. I simply don't see much or any incentive for someone capable of doing that sort of thing to create a bitcoin exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:02:10
Nearly every exchange (every one I've traded on) uses a binary protocol (look up ITCH, FIX, OUCH protocols), and the extra cost of translation between different languages from the "brain" to the feed and order submission data is too costly for true hft.if this guy was actually in HFT, which I doubt, he would be using c or c for all that stuff

But PHP sure tries way harder than any other language.

What violence is there trading on NASDAQ or CME or FWB?
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:50:02
They make money on trading volume, what incentive do they have to not invite bots?

This is what the US government tried to do with Reg NMS -- it's not clear that this actually accomplishes what it's meant to do, or really beneficial at all.
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:57:09
sure, but if that doesn't outweigh the $$ they make on commish, then they have no reason to care
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:14:48
So where do you think I'm wrong?
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:30:54


This is about as useful an argument as "It's difficult to trade bitcoin because your power could go out". Are you going to actually respond to anything I ask or should I quit trying?
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:19:00
uoxKSdbhp7op didn't mention cryptocurrency.

open source doesn't mean that people who are wildly underqualified should be contributing. In fact, it's usually the opposite.

Donald Knuth isn't the one here repeatedly bringing up premature optimization. You are.
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:57:56
Because it's a lot of work and the people capable enough to do that sort of thing correctly are already getting paid more than they could make trying to set up an exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:22:23
Seriously, I work in HFT in Chicago and know a couple buddies at different firms, no one is seriously going to spend time developing a strategy for BTC when theres a million other thicker products with cleaner data on more reliable exchanges to work on.
@_date: 2013-08-02 00:02:30
do you have trouble reading the subreddit rules or something? SRS is a circlejerk, no one gives a shit about trying to get into an argument with you about why bitcoins are good or bad.
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:47:40
Woah, how did you get all the way to that when the only thing we've been talking about is the difficulty of being able to trade financial products? Are you mistaking me for another poster or something? Can you address at least one of my points? Any one of them at all would be nice.
@_date: 2013-04-13 09:37:18
In a price-time priority order book, you would have to sync up every core handling the order book on every order entry/cancel/trade. This is slower and more complicated than simply building the order book on a single core quickly.
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:29:00
What is this "unless you're given permission" shit?
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:37:37
That's called a bid-ask spread, it means no one is submitting bids above $120 or offers below $170.
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:00:03
Well, first of all, opening an exchange is a totally different thing than trying to trade an instrument on an exchange, which is what your original comment was referring to as far as I could tell. Second, what real life examples are there of people being violently prevented from opening another exchange? There's already thirteen equity exchanges in the US.

What percentile do you have to be in in terms of net worth for you to consider yourself upper class?
@_date: 2013-04-17 01:20:05


What's stopping *you* from doing the same thing? The risk of your wall getting blown through and the price not coming back before you have to puke your position.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:27:44
What's the point of using a different language for each new exchange? That's like, one of the points of having an API.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:21:56
Okay, how would you ensure it without requiring a full sync? Let's say we have 5 CPU's, A-E. CPU A receives an order to post bid at 100.01 -- It *cannot* post that bid to the order book until it verifies with every other cpu that there does not exist a bid with 100.01 with an earlier timestamp that hasn't yet been posted to the order book (because, say, CPU B is currently processing it). The whole process from the moment you receive the order to when you post it to the order book has to be atomic. In *any* case, it's simply easier to write an efficient, fast single core matching engine to manage all order processing than to do some sort of distributed parallel system.

Is there any proof that people are switching in significant numbers because MTG ox released an API?

bitcoin-24? Is that the exhange written by the guy who doesn't know what a transaction in a database is?
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:46:34
? No, I mean, why do you think you need some special permission to be able to trade things outside of bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:27:01


Yes, because I asked a specific question, not for your whole fucking political ideology, christ. Thanks for *finally* answering my question.
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:49:38
You'd declare it as capital gains, what are the cops going to do about it? Itemize your trades and file.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:37:44
Yes. No offense, do you not know how price-time priority works? Or do you not actually trade on mtgox and you're just wondering?
