You weren't listening.  Not surprising if you were at the gym though.
As CNN often does, they have two viewpoints on for a segment to debate.  One guy was bullish and the other bearish.  The guy not buying in did call it a scam etc but CNN was not saying that is the case.
Smerconish had Ron Paul on, who although he has difficulty grasping the fact you can't touch bitcoin, is an advocate of a decentralized currency and against fiat currency.

That word does not mean what you think it means.

Alot of this sub really needs to graduate high school and college.  For fuck's sake this is absolutely pathetic.

I think you missed his /s.

I appreciate the info.  Is there an actual protocol for something like this?

Hello bcash shill.

Please let me add this is not FUD and BTC makes up a substantial portion of my crypto portfolio.  Just trying to understand if there is a scenario where my coins are stuck in limbo for the long term.

There seems to be more and more troll accounts spreading dis-information to stoke fear about BTC and your bank account.

Holy shit, this guy tweeted a link to the wired article that was posted here sometime last month about someone who recovered their money from a trezor... but tells his followers he lost it all.

Who the fuck cares what "the moon" is?

Good idea but still too risky.  I've replayed the 24 word recovery seed in my mind so many times that it is now part of my genetic make up...literally.  I had my blood drawn last week by Dr. Ver to confirm.  It's there.

That's how I felt in September and don't regret it now.

There need to be post quality rules that are moderated.  There also should be several stickied threads where you can post shitty memes, just bought xyz amount, and other stuff.  It will never be removed but it should be moderated in some capacity.  For the influence this subreddit has, it is full of a ton of horrible and awful shit posts.  I agree with OP 100%.

Subbed.  Thank you.

I use Coinbase (yes I know the fees).  My BTC is available 10/21.  If I transfer to my Trezor immediately will it be there by 10/25?  I can't recall from my last transfer at 3800 how long coinbase takes to send externally. I remember it being fast.

The interface looks preferable to me on the trezor.

Thank you.

This is a terrible, shitty meme.

Yanno, it is really high.
