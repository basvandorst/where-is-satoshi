Yep, but not just trying to withdraw, I received an email that my account just needs futher verification so instead  I opted not to use them anymore.
Too bad, they were great

Heh actually i have 3 bank accounts and none have that ludicrous kyc procedures as btc exchanges do
First acc I had to show up, sign in and they verified my name and details with my ID. Did not scan it.
Second and third account I opened online using first one and that was enough of verification, that first bank did.

@_date: 2017-12-06 23:17:37
I don't need excuses. I have access to all top torrent sites and I have enough money to buy any game I want. I torrent when it's easier and I pay when it's easier.
I just chose to buy games when they had bitcoin enabled because its easier and safer for me. I now choose to stop doing that because I no longer can buy games like I used to. I will never ever support paypal and i don't really want to give steam my credit card or even my name.
I probably won't torrent any game soon since I have huge backlog anyway, but now that's what I'd do.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:34:25
Why do they care if they used bitpay anyway? Bitpay gave them exact requested $$ no? Or with current pump, even more.
Anyways looks like steam no longer is easier to use than torrents so back to torrents it is.

Pepper spray is illegal in UK? It's probably the best self-defense tool you can have, its safe to use, causes no permanent damage and can disarm someone three times your size, even if he's on drugs.
Here pepper spray is legal, but there is chemical spray type that isn't. This one can actually cause permanent damage and is also less effective, because some drugs make you resistant to it to a degree..

No, it's altcoin that just starts with your current BTC balance.
1. after split, move all BTC to new addresses (if using seeded wallet like electrum, generate new seeds). All your BTC will be safe at new addresses now.
2. start BCC wallet with your old wallet files - now with 0 BTC
3. BCC will see your old amount that you can spend again
4. exchange BCC to BTC if you find some suckers

@_date: 2016-11-28 18:06:08
Sorry if I come across that way. But seeing the influx of people spamming "assange is dead, wikileaks is a honeypot" is annoying and I just treat them as shills. Not very friendly to shills I guess :P
Parent comment went all ahead and discouraged people from donating. That is just harmful. And he's basing it off conspiracy theories and/or 3-letter-agencies dream.
The *if you* line wasn't specifically targetted at you, just people who say such things..
@_date: 2016-11-28 18:50:31
If $agency gained access to all their servers, emails, twitter, facebook, bitcoin wallet, killed all techs, killed Assange... what makes PGP so uniquely secure that it would stand irrefutable proof? Why wouldn't $agency just use it?
@_date: 2016-11-28 18:30:36
I am not being paid to post on reddit, sadly. I want people to believe in wikileaks, in assange and I want people to support them.
You on the other hand want to discourage people from that.
Who's the shill?
@_date: 2016-11-28 18:01:07
Because it's getting tiresome. There is no proof to satisfy those people, live feed is fake, and i Assange came to their house they would scream its a clone or a robot. Furthermore, wikileaks still operates like it did before. Leaks are coming through. What else do you need? 
On the other hand MASS of people spamming bullshit about wikileaks being now CIA op DOES sound like actual CIA op to discredit wikileaks, prevent people from donating, make it seem untrustworthy to whistleblowers etc. So if you repeat the "assange is dead, stop contributing, its all honeypot" you're actually working for the enemy. Good job.
@_date: 2016-11-28 18:28:08
How much are they paying you to spread these lies?
Because right now you're really playing into whatever script feds would LOVE people to believe. 
Fact: feds hate wikileaks. They will stop at nothing to discourage people from supporting it. 
They framed assange for sex abuse, for being russian spy, for being pedophile and now that he's dead. And you're supporting that.

Can you separately spend litecoins and bitcoins? Yes, because those are separate coins. Same with BCC and BTC. It just starts with your current bitcoin balance.

Uh but bitpay is used by a lot of vendors, including eg. Steam. It's a payment processor. With BitPay I can comfortably pay in bitcoin at a lot of places.
Alternative as in exchange + bank account to move money to + pay in $$ ? Fuck that
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:48:03
Be realistic. BitPay's service is really good and enabled a lot, A LOT of services to be paid for in Bitcoin. They wouldn't have accepted it if they had to make their own trading bot or deal with exchanges. Steam could switch platforms to like Coinpay or others, but doubt they'll care to switch for Segwit2x. 
If not for such service 99% of current merchants wouldn't give two shits. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 06:00:36
You greatly underestimate amount of work needed to make this right. And then hiring more accountants to do the trading. And the fact that they'd be getting completely different amounts at the end of the day - something a 3rd party service has to deal with and is part of their business

Oh right... 6800 per miner, and you want to buy 1000 miners that's 6.8 million dollars. For a 300 usd profit per miner? Or a little over 4.4% return? And are you sure you'll be able to sell 1000 miners with any sort of profit later?
Pretty sure if you invested 7 million in buying and selling btc you'd make more, even on small price fluctuations. Also stock market, investment, saving account etc
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:33:14
So I have bitcoins right now. Using electrum and trezor to manage them.
Do I have to do anything special? Aside from new features Segwit brings, can I still use old software?
And then, after the fork, I'll be able to import same seed to BCC client and operate it independently of BTC? So if I found some sucker to exchange BCC to BTC, I would get double BTC out of the fork?
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:07:50


That is total net from buying new, mining on it and then selling for less than you bought?
$18 per day or $300 profit in the lifetime of miner seems low, almost as waste of time. With hundreds of thousands invested at all times.
