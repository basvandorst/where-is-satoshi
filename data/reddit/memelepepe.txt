I am so honest and say I do not claim the sendings. But I will hold them. Its my first walled since I downloaded the software 2011 and forget that walled 2012.
It says 0.00 BTC on the old software, still updating.
I had for a week on that days 1200 BTC! Could still cry every day. That sucks so hard. Now I think that Bug comes direct from God or something.

best timing will be the must-coming hardfork, its Bitcoin than still Bitcoin Core?

Because it is unique, reasons: 1. For the real gold coins I am just to the need personally adhering. Clarname, address, you can already recognize it at the domain. Later, a community-based SE is supposed to watch over it. 2. of course, the other cryptocurrenys or ETFs are based on USD or just fake (like Goldcoin) = none of this can be traded for real gold coins. 3. Bitcoin will be very unstable because of this reasons: a) like the must-coming hardfork in timeline. At this time I will force to bring my created cryptocurrency in. Real U.S. 0.9 gold coins, published before 1907, I own already today. I would like to share this with Blockchain to start mining new, real gold coins.

We bring the old gold standard back and make paper money like worthless. USDGOLDCOIN.COM -   coupled on start to one, end on thousand real .9 OZ Gold Coins - will come on 2018   because of    in future. The  made by Bitcoins over 3,000 USD would be in short worth 3,000 UGC, comes as with   mark my words. (And since I checked out: the currently on working  is a   =  White Paper (idea, stats) would be like: One USDGOLDCOIN would be worth 1/100 from 0.9 OZ Gold. We had than 100,000 coins in circulation with currently 1 UGC = 1.26 $ or 1.13 € worth, a relatively stable cryptocoin. Gold would be saved in a community based SE (a company in the EU). Started with 1,000 Coins, in future each month will be 1,000+ UGC to mines. According to certification, everyone can pay off an original 0.9 GOLD OZ with 1,000 UGC before/at or after the end of mining. In this case, on each payout one real 0.9 OZ gold coin is bought, because the 1,000,000.00000 UGC will remain. The number in circulation can neither be reduced nor increased. It could have an impact on old oz gold coins, the gold price and the Dollar/Euro itself. A dream or hell for a cryptotrader. Safety, Speed, Anonymity in the Blockchain and it could begin after a bit marketing. In summary: 1. Idea [X] 2. Website [ ] 3. Blockchain [ ] 4. Safety, Speed, Anonymity checks [ ] 5. Marketing [ ] ... start sometime from 2018. And I really do not need to profit with the project, already have real 10,000 UGC, lol (10x old 0.9 gold oz's). Project made in Germany, where Bitcoin is still not really known here.
