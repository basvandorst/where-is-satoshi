I don't know what his convictions are other than being vehemently opposed to BIP101. There's a big difference between "here is my position, tell me where I'm wrong" and "here is my position, and here are the rules that prevent you promoting competing ideas." The former demonstrates confidence in your ideas and convictions. The latter indicates the defense of dogma, where dissent is blasphemy and can lead to excommunication.
There is no other discussion that I've followed that has been as poorly managed as the block size debate on and I think a lot of that is due to No sub should talk about its mods as much as this one does.

I do think they should have returned your money more quickly, but I don't see how they could refund the exact BTC. They probably never held BTC, so they are just sending and receiving funds in USD via their BTC processor.

Let's see how well Cunningham's Law works :)
My understanding is that wallets that have only received BTC would be safe. The wallet address is a hash of the public key. You have to to publish the public key to send BTC, so if you've sent BTC a quantum computer could more easily derive the private key than a classical computer could. Quantum computers wouldn't be able to do this instantaneously, so the attack would still take some effort. How much effort is the big unknown, and that will depend on how quickly quantum computing scales.
There might be ways to secure the wallet by signing a new, quantum-safe private and public keys with the old private and public key before the original public key is published (at which point the original private key would be considered useless).

Yes, you alone know how the world and every business should work and it's everyone else's fault for not acting accordingly.


So you don't like ads in general (due to, you know, morals and stuff), but you like the services that ads allow, but that's ok because HTTP is a pull protocol (what?), and businesses that use ads for revenue are shitty and deserve to die. It's your computer, but it's not your content.


Not everyone is a huge content provider trying to scam people. And blocking tracking cookies I don't have a problem with.
@_date: 2014-06-02 04:22:40
There is no such thing as an acceptable ad? How about there's no such thing as a free lunch? Plenty of websites don't ask for a thing to view their content and expect to offset some of the hosting and bandwidth costs serving up ads. I'd much prefer unobstrusive ads to micro transactions for viewing content on websites.
I get that you don't like ads, but don't pretend that ABP trying to find a balance is, in your words, "completely unacceptable".  I find it less acceptable to knowingly access a website that you use or enjoy without providing anything in return, in a manner contrary to the website's design.
The best way to not see ads is to not visit websites that show ads.  If this isn't possible, filtering out the really bad ads and leaving in a few non-distracting ones to pay the bills is reasonable.

Do people run full wallets on Android devices?  Just curious since the full blockchain would take a huge amount of the device's storage, and staying in sync would kill battery.  Do people run light wallets? 
I have a Nexus 7, but I don't see what the major practical advantage in terms of capability a native app could provide.  The implementation could be better, but what is the added capability?

It tends to go the other direction, and that in 3 months there might be more wallet apps approved for iOS. If you followed the whole Google Voice app fiasco, they eventually relented and allowed the app in the store.  Smart workarounds like this app has just make the prohibition seem sillier.
The reason I think they don't want to allow Bitcoin apps is more than just them wanting their cut of each Bitcoin bought or sold.  A Bitcoin wallet app would make it possible to circumvent payment through the app store.  It's similar to why they didn't want a Flash player in the browser.  Why buy through the app store when the Flash version is just as good or cheaper?  In the case for a Bitcoin wallet, why accept 70% payment through the app store when I can get 100% of the payment via some Bitcoin app?

How do we know you aren't trying to force your definition of certain words for political and financial gain? I instinctively assume that aggressive linguistic prescriptivism is malicious. Your attempt to control the contexts words are allowed to be used should be discouraged.
If I install the Bitcoin Core wallet and start it up for the first time, it would need to synchronize with the network. How would you describe the manner in which this is accomplished? Centralized or decentralized? Similarly, when I send Bitcoin to someone, does it go through a central verification server at Bitcoin.org, or is it relayed through a decentralized network?

What issues do people have with Gavin? I've never had a reason to question his motives or sincerity. I get that some people don't like what he's done after stepping down from Core, but ultimately if he were going to have some secret, malicious agenda why would he have stepped down in the first place? Nothing he's done since stepping down from Core leads me to believe that he's anything but a person who wants Bitcoin to continue to become more and more viable.
I think that the Bitcoin that captured everyone's imagination a few years ago is not the Bitcoin that is currently being developed. Or maybe it is, but the messaging has been so bad that it's hard to get a read on what's really happening.

Do you really not know that this is a reasonably common position? Sometimes words have a different meaning separately than they do together. A quick Google search would have shown that it's not some crazy made up title.

Saying that the Bitcoin network is decentralized is an absolutely correct and proper usage of the word "[decentralized]( You are either new to Bitcoin or have a tenuous grasp of the terms you're using. Let me educate you a little bit. 
If you download a file from a specific website, that transfer is centralized. If the web server goes down, you can't download the file and any in-progress downloads will fail. If you download a torrent, the transfer of data is decentralized. If one of the peers you are connected to disconnects, you can connect to another peer or request the data from an existing peer and the process can continue without failing. The Bitcoin Core wallet acts as a full node. When it is running you can see the other nodes you are connected to. Should you exit the software, other nodes will continue to operate and propagate transactions through the network.
Decentralization doesn't mean alt-coins would be able to use the Bitcoin blockchain. Decentralization means that there is no master/alpha/super node that the rest of the network depends on to operate. Nodes can go offline and due to the decentralized nature of the network transactions will continue to propagate through the network.
You are aggressively and baselessly saying that the only correct way to use the word "decentralized" is in the context of miners. Mining (de)centralization is certainly an aspect of Bitcoin, but it doesn't preclude the correct usage of the word "decentralized" in other contexts.
[Here's a good starting point if you want to learn more about the nature of Bitcoin's network]( Hint: search for the word "decentralized".
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:14:09
But that's not what OP claimed. You just approximated OP's argument and rounded up to the nearest counter-argument you had available.
Throughout the thread the word "miner" is used ambiguously to mean either "someone who runs Bitcoin mining software" or the software itself. This allows you to "reliably say that they don't know how bitcoin works" when you constrain the meaning to be software only. I took OP's comments to mean people who mine Bitcoin.
But that's fine, keep reliably dismissing people and pushing for some super-duper-UASF, because clearly anyone who disagrees just doesn't understand Bitcoin.

Putting some flavor of this sentiment in every one of your replies most likely has the opposite effect you're hoping it does. Whenever I see someone pulling the old "you don't understand Bitcoin" line (the implication being that they alone are the bestest and wisest understanders of Bitcoin), I immediately think "Dunning–Kruger effect."

Many organizations have this role. I think you'd either not need to know this or not understand what this role is to have a negative reaction to it. Nobody would assume that the chief science officer of NASA is a self-important title, or that the title implies  dominion over all of space.
Also, I think your reaction is related to your view of Gavin. Would you similarly object to Satoshi being the Chief Scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation? For me, Gavin has always been an authority in the development of Bitcoin. Honestly until the block size debate, I didn't know any other programmer's name who was involved with Bitcoin. When there was an accidental hard fork a few years ago, he wrote the the explanation of what happened and how it would be fixed, and lo and behold, he was correct.

Can we stop with this slavery analogy? Slavery was way fucking worse. If governments start restricting travel en masses and compelling physical labor with the immediate threat of violence en masse we can talk about using the term.

Yes, but this isn't a law. You can't be charged with violating an EO, there has to be an underlying law that they claim you violated. I know laws can be stretched to do all sorts of things not in the letter or spirit of the law, but this isn't a law.

Am I the only one who has a totally different read on this? I don't think this Executive Order is what OP thinks it is.
Here's an article summarizing the EO on Ars Technica: [Obama signs executive order imposing sanctions on overseas hackers.
President: "From now on, we have the power to freeze their assets."](
Here are the first two paragraphs of that article:




I tend to trust Ars Technica.
And I'm not at all saying this is a good EO, I'm saying I really don't think this applies if you donate to Snowden  "they can take all your stuff without due process instantly..." Ex post facto laws (or retroactive laws) are not allowed by the constitution (Article 1, section 9, clause 3: "No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.") Unless the government can make a convincing argument that Snowden is still actively engaged in malicious hacking from Russia, this wouldn't apply. Moreover, all of Snowden's information that I'm aware of came from things he had access to from within the NSA, not from things he got through hacking from the outside.
EOs are a different beast from laws. Bush signed the controversial EO 13233 and Obama revoked it January 2009. Laws rarely get that type of rapid removal.
And, just to maximize my comment's downvote potential, [here's what the president said on Medium.](

Honestly curious, where should he (or his staffers) have posted this? Your comment had me thinking about this. For instance, .gov sites probably shouldn't host editorial content, any social media site would draw complaints from people who don't use the site out of protest, a custom or separate blog site would require some upkeep.
The only alternative I could think of was Github. It's not necessarily the best site for reading, but it would be an interesting choice considering their very recent (and I believe ongoing) DDOSing for hosting anti-censorship projects, specifically anti-great firewall projects intended for Chinese users (China or Chinese interests appear to be facilitating the DDOSing).

I'm sure with the right amount of untethered cynicism and speculation you could come up with an even bolder claim than InfoWars: 
**New Executive Order: Obama Takes Total Control of Internet: Declares ‘National Cyber Security Emergency’**
And that's the problem with speculation. This EO is based on a similar one that specifically targeted North Korea. I'm sure if you look hard enough you'll find similar speculation about any number of EOs from any number of presidents. Snowden wasn't changed with violating an EO, he was (wrongly and unjustly) charged with violating the Espionage Act. You can't be charged and found guilty in court of violating this EO, that's not how it works. You would have to violate an existing law. What law does using Bitcoin violate?
Saying that using Bitcoin puts you at risk based on this EO is like saying people who use an ATM on the Plus or STAR interbank networks are at risk for the same reasons. It's too big an assumption for me to accept without some evidence that the government is moving in that direction. It's something to pay attention to, absolutely, but saying that it's illegal to donate to Snowden full-stop without anything besides a highly-speculative interpretation based on a chain of what-ifs (and a very probable misreading of some of the text) doesn't cut it for me. I'm not at all saying that the worst-case scenarios in this thread can't happen, I'm saying there isn't enough evidence to say that it WILL happen, which is what OP did.

I disagree. Well, with the first part, not the second part. I don't think anyone is claiming that today's Bitcoin protocol is scaling optimally, so it's reasonable to regard this as a flaw with the protocol. At some point in the future we might be able to claim that expectations are the problem, but right now you are likely defending what will eventually look like the dial-up connection of scaling implementations. I don't mean that as a slight on Bitcoin, just that I don't think we're anywhere close to optimal.
@_date: 2016-10-26 04:08:28
Having transactions confirm within a reasonable time frame is pretty important. Surely you don't think that it's a good thing for transactions to take so long to confirm?
This is more than just having to wait longer for confirmation. This makes it impossible / much more difficult to buy things using many Bitcoin payment processors. Several of the ones I've used have a 15 minute window during which they have to see a confirmation at the receiving address they've provided, after that they float the exchange rate used for the transaction. Now you've either over or underpaid. You can deal with this with a several emails and a few more transactions, but it's a PITA. This is even worse if you were demoing Bitcoin to someone when this happens.
If I can FedEx someone a check more quickly than I can send someone Bitcoin, that's a problem. The frequency isn't a reason to dismiss posts like this, it substantiates the problem. A lot of posts here are about shortcomings with fiat currency and flaws with the banking system. I consider this to be a flaw with the Bitcoin network as it stands today, and it should be addressed.
Posts like this also serve an informational purpose. I was going to buy something with Bitcoin tonight. Now I will wait until the backlog clears.
@_date: 2016-10-26 09:38:52
There's a 0.03% chance a block will take over 60 minutes, and a 5% chance over 30. Surely you've bought something online with Bitcoin where you see they show you a receiving address, the amount to pay and a timer. It could be that the payment processor isn't waiting for a confirmation but waiting to see the transaction on one of their nodes, I honestly don't know. Even if that's the case, a backlog causing the mempool to freeze new transactions or set a higher minimal fee threshold would delay your transaction.
The 15 minute window is how long they lock the exchange rate for your purchase. The store wants $50, payment processor says "I'll agree to accept X Bitcoin for $50".
