LOL. It's a hot take on a 2014 meme - welcome to crypto, enjoy your stay.

Perhaps a flippant question, but seriously: I think they'd be more likely to accept the bitcoin system backed by universal laws over anything else we use as a store of value. They'd also likely be of sufficient technology level to exceed humankind mining, unfortunately.

You should be very careful. A person you can trust to help you with nearly half a million USD is rare. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 07:26:46
This is the right call. I applaud you for being the first at taking the harder, values based decision here. Just like BTC. This is how we start changing the way people think. 
@_date: 2019-08-27 18:55:27
that's a bcash site, not bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-17 18:33:42
seems like right now it's mostly a maybe pick 1 scenario..

Good writeup - the only thing I'd add is: there still exists a sizable (imo) group of people in that sub who essentially got conned during the block size debate. I think it's easy to write them off as paid shills, but a disappointing portion are also just suckers that got scammed. People in that situation (marks) tend to dig in and stick passionately to the scammed-side mentality because their ego won't let them admit what happened. It's hard to have sympathy or empathy for them, but they are victims - they were robbed of massive amounts of potentially the most scarce asset and best opportunity they or their offspring will see for many generations.
On the flip side, I'm quite thankful that we had a culling and the weaker people all went off to battle their own dramas with ABC versus SV etc. Those chain(s) will survive as honeypots helping Bitcoin. It's just unfortunate that innocent new users will fall prey to  and bitcoin.com.
@_date: 2019-08-06 15:46:49
Empathizing with the Bitcoins eh? lol
@_date: 2019-10-08 14:57:23
Appreciate the hard work on the software and UX, but shouldn't we be incentivizing these? Ignoring philosophy and just thinking pragmatically from a business owner's perspective, the competitor (card payment devices for mobiles) is free. 
I guess my disconnect is that the company's target demographic is probably wealthy adopters rather than average people/shops with low skills wanting to get into/accept Bitcoin. Sad to see the already high price go up and global likelyhood of someone adding btc+ln nodes go down. Nodl is same. IM[H]O the time for chasing high margins is later. ��‍♂️

Ah, that's too bad. There is a small risk the block gets rejected as a result, I guess. I figured he'd be flexible, but the time frames and low block count makes it a bit riskier for that size pool. Curious, did you offer like 1 BTC fee to do it?
@_date: 2019-08-06 16:00:30
Same man, same.
@_date: 2019-08-03 02:58:06
Flip the question to the other side of the pair - do you think the USD will deflate in the extreme to make BTC zero in relation to it? That idea seems pretty absurd at this point...
@_date: 2019-10-10 07:58:32
"excess" is the key word in their description...
@_date: 2019-10-10 04:35:42
the KFC colonel is behind it all!
@_date: 2019-08-27 17:14:28
Agree he gets blame. Just don't think he gets credit for the initial scam both times. He just copied (forged? lol) the bch scam.
@_date: 2019-06-16 12:17:31
hard to represent, but since there aren't that many btc, perhaps also a metric accounting for that?
@_date: 2019-06-20 20:05:36
ROMO is coming. Reality of Missing Out.
@_date: 2019-10-08 15:42:19
Agree, though IMO security on that level isn't a concept that will get through to average users/shop owners. I'd just love to see Casa POS terminals and such. Maybe that's where Square lands and I'm just conflating the two hoping Casa does it to get us there quicker. 
Specific demographics aside, I think ln adds the actual financial incentive to running a node we've needed, even if potentially small. 
Also appreciate the incentive program and its goal. I throw sats into the lightning faucets every week trying to do my small part along the same lines.
@_date: 2019-06-16 13:03:38
I agree in the long term of course, but it'd be nice to represent somehow now for people who don't understand the math doesn't even work.
@_date: 2019-06-16 13:52:45
Just that the btc needed to represent the market cap doesn't exist. Not sure the metric that makes most sense. Probably a similar concept to  driving the value of the fiat down.
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:49:26
bsv sure, he doesn't get credit for bch (not that credit for bch is a good thing)
@_date: 2019-10-05 06:30:46
did you try kano? maybe include/offer large fee for doing it?
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:23:05
My thoughts exactly. Given the benefit of the doubt that this isn't just FUDing, it's clearly naive based on the C comment. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:17:30
If you think *this* is a negative perspective of bitcoin, boy you should have been here before the past 12 months. the current opinion is practically angelic - volatile sure, but long gone is the primary belief it's fake or **only** for scammers and criminals. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:49:20
The concern is that valuable time is spent supporting production users.. and that the devs will be restrained from certain choices because of real money (mainnet) users. I agree with both, though I'd have agreed much more vehemently 2 years ago.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:45:52
I'm not advocating production use. You missed the point: the opposition lost the initiative (on one front, at least). 
@_date: 2019-09-15 16:40:02
@_date: 2019-09-12 03:44:05
If you're talking about UX, why would you even mention core? Consider the state of wallets in the ecosystem 4 years ago. We're eons past what we had.
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:59:16
The branding is always first to mind, but that ship obviously sailed a long time ago.
UI/UX isn't as bad as it used to be, lots of cool stuff out there. I'd almost not call it a problem, aside from addresses, which is maybe not something we ever want to simplify (introduce risk). 
I really just wish we could fast forward to better general understanding. Every time I pay with lightning, I'm almost in awe at what just happened on a metaphysical level... a laws of the universe backed value transfer near instantly completed for sub-1sat. It takes 1-4 hours with a smart person (depending on base level knowledge) to explain it. To most, it looks no different than PayPal or Venmo payments. It's just like early Internet days though, I know understanding comes with time.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:14:45
I do think the spamming was happening (for a few discrete outcomes) and they now want to slow down lightning more than other goals, but you're of course welcome to be skeptical. :)
