I asume that as of now it´s cheaper to send it throigh remittance company since with Bitcoin you would need to buy in circle, send btc and then withdraw through a banck transfer(which is still more expensive).
In the following weeks/months we will be enabling cash-out which will reduce significantly the cost. I recomend you check mondome.com to for the cheaper remittance cost. cheers

You can get pesos from Bitcoin using Bitex.la. The only limitation right now is that it should be a banck deposit. We are working on allowing the cash-out also through our offices.

on the other hand +80% of people have access to internet which is good since this will become their alphabetism for the future. Either way when time comes that we don´t have restrictions bitcoin will flourish.
