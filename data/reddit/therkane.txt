No, the Blockchain is incidental. The whole point was to have a decentralized system by which people could hold and transfer value, without the need for banks, *or the billionaires that run them.*
If you think the only takeaway from Bitcoin is its Blockchain, you're sadly mistaken.

So, by this logic, you could claim that, if someone said anything, anywhere within someone else's property lines, the property owner could simply silence them for an "offensive" or otherwise "objectionable" statement? I'm sorry, but how is this not [censorship] ( 
Private property or no, in most governments (and corporations, like Reddit, since you brought it up) that exist in so-called "free states" don't simply "remove" the offender from their property immediately, nor do they force exile for speaking one's mind. It's against the very principle of free speech to do so. That doesn't mean there won't be consequences later, but it still goes against that person's right to speak their mind.
Or did you forget how this concept is supposed to work?

Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you specifically were pushing it. We can both agree completely on readiness, though.

But why "punish" miners if they're not behaving badly? You can have powerful FGPA-or ASIC-based miners and simultaneously *not* be malicious. What about the Regular Joe who has (or more likely, had) miners chugging along in his basement? 
It always sounds like bad policy to me to attack those upon whom the network is built (miners).

Maybe I'm crazy, but it seems unwise and borders on foolish to push this hard for a PoW shift, or *any* untested change, without first evaluating its effects on the network. It's all well and good to claim that another algorithm could greatly benefit Bitcoin, but unless there's some kind of research done on the subject of both how it could specifically do so and why we'd do it, I'll remain a skeptic.
After all, it's not often the case that something like this can just be "dropped in" like people seem to imagine. Unless there's a specific feature of Bitcoin which I'm not immediately aware of?

I can see it being almost as contentious as a fork. Especially when (from the article) it:
- Introduces new PoW algorithm(s)
- Uses anything less than 100% continuous hashing power (possibly most contentious of all)
- With each PoW added requires a number, n, of 10(n)-minute blocks, *each.*  
- Probably does more (in an actual implementation) than either the author or myself have considered. 
From the article: 




 
Emphasis mine.
The point is that I agree, that this definitely needs more scrutiny, and though I think it's a great idea in theory, a lot more work needs to be done to get it working (and working correctly) in code.

Yes, but that doesn't really help with the increase in the total number of transactions overall. How does more precise fee calculation reduce the amount of transactions per block?

Depends on how you view Coinbase. Lots of people hate it.

I've been hearing this for years and read all about its promise, but still no LN outside of testnet. What's the hold up?


I'm sorry, layer-2? I think we're using different terminology here. What do you mean by this?

This sentiment seems to reflect behavior from *both sides* of the scaling debate right now, which is problematic because both sides think they're right, creating deadlock and hindering the progress of this thing we all love called Bitcoin. 
Go ahead and downvote if you must, just my $0.02.

Yet by changing/adding only one line in a bitcoin.conf file, users could easily become miners. This frames the argument in such a way that makes it seem like a false dichotomy. At the very least it seems disingenuous.
Without users, there would be no transactions (or very few, since miners are profit-driven and eventually might need or want to convert to local currency). Similarly, without miners, transactions would never verify, and no new coins are ever produced. See the problem here? You need both.
Also, why would it be at all necessary to achieve a 95% hash rate for SW consensus if miners don't actually have a say? The only real answer to this is: because everyone (or as close to everyone as possible in this case) needs to be on board, *users and miners alike.*

ID required for any amount? Seems dumb for a one-way machine. I get the compliance part, but really? Who would want to launder $20, let alone seriously consider it? Maybe the operator is just doing some CYA? Still, seems ridiculous.
KYC/AML laws, while well-meaning, are ultimately stupid. It's still not going to prevent a sufficiently wealthy individual from using other means to successfully launder money. In my mind, it's really a lot like claiming you shouldn't use fiat because terrorists do, and it certainly won't stop that either.

Cover Your Ass(ets). I've seen/heard both. It's just an expression.

For some reason, I thought there was some kind of a lower limit that you could get away with before those rules kicked in, or that you didn't necessarily need to worry about it if you were running a one-way machine.
Thanks for the link.
