There's 140,000 coins in just three addresses that haven't moved since 2010/2011.
Are the keys lost? I don't know.  But they very well might be.   That's just the tip of coins that have been sitting places potentially lost.

You should try reaching out bitaccess, I know they have been secretly working on some cool things behind the scenes.

The best way to hold bitcoin is the same for the best practices with all things security related.   Have backups, don't keep everything in one place, use multi-factor authentication, and continually audit and review your security.   
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:17:16
I think at some point you have to be the adoption.  As a professional person living in the US, I have access to every banking feature available.   But I still use bitcoin on a weekly basis.
Half the time I use it because I should use it, the other half it really is easier.  Paying friends is infinitely easier with bitcoin.  Traveling abroad is easier with bitcoin. Paying for hosting or domain names is very easy too.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:34:50
Sure, it's a bit of a crap shoot.  But it's higher probability of  either getting coins returned or denying the attackers coins, which reduces the incentive for these kind of attacks. 
To be fair, the CORRECT strategy is to secure you're shit. I don't want to be misconstrued as condoning the reliance on miners as a corporate security measure.  
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:52:05
I'm sorry you feel that way.  I'm not an idealist and I enjoy using it when I use it.
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:43:02
If you've ever had to build a high volume bitcoin wallet, it almost demands using a third party service OR hiring dedicated developers in house.  It's not a trivial thing.   
I would, and have, chosen to outsource that particular part of the business myself especially when the best solution is a company with leadership and quality such as Bitgo's.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:44:10

We've already been through this before and people did get sued and people did go to jail. I don't know why you would think otherwise.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:50:17
Your's too.  The long term disruption could very well outweigh the immediate return.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:44:08
You yourself are probably the weakest link in that scenario. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:50:47
Mark Kappeles was just released from jail... 
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:34:56
everyone should contact law enforcement if you had money in bitfinex.  If only to increase the transparency of the investigation. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:56:16
Lots of people would disagree with you.  40% of the United States have used alternative financial services and that number is growing.  
Have you ever had a security hold placed on your debit/credit card, leaving you stuck at a store without access to your money? Or maybe stranded at a gas station unable to refuel your car?  Have you ever needed to send money to someone but it was outside banking hours?
There are endless stream of scenarios that warrant being in full control of your own money, especially when its only a portion of your own money.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:16:05
You are mostly correct. However, the the correct strategy is to position the coins in the hands of the known mining pools which can be then intercepted by law enforcement accordingly.   You stand a significantly better chance of recovering of some coins in this scenario as opposed to a nearly binary outcome in the scenario of an unknown attacker. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:50:06
You also don't have the resources to manage security the way a larger organization does.  I'm certain that more bitcoins have been lost/stolen from personal computers than in any bitcoin theft. 
But I'm not advocating keeping it all with bitgo, or all on an exchange.   There are costs, everyone needs to assess them individually. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:50:25
when you say he dismissed the possibility of it, can you reference that please?
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:44:44
That might be the case, or at least a contributing factor.   However it still should have been caught. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:34:01
Of course they are there for a reason, to protect Coinbase.

Look man, bitcoin is bitcoin.   You can keep it in an exchange and that exchange might get hacked. You can keep it in paper wallet and your house can burn down.  You can keep it in your own wallet and lose your phone/forget the password. 
One of the most powerful features of bitcoin is that you can move money without a bank double checking your transaction.  We all know that the reward far outweighs the risk.  But there isn't any one solution.  Be smart, don't keep your life savings in one place, and continually revisit/reassess your risk position.

or maybe some people should consider the implications of starting a MTG trading platform that accepts bitcoins when there is already an embattled MTG trading platform that uses bitcoin and is called... MTGOX... 
just an idea tho. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:14:39
Sure!  
We have a letter from our home state saying we are cleared to operate, and we are pursuing letters/licenses in each of the other US states.  We are also cleared to operate in Canada and are working on the UK.
So we are actively working on things and are in good standing currently.  What I mean is that all of bitcoin companies are in a really strange area, and either things are going to go well for us (as a community) or they are going to go bad here in the US.  
Does that make sense?

@_date: 2014-02-18 06:51:30
No idea.  I would **EXPECT** your money to be safe, and your bitcoins to be withdraw-able,   but we should all be cautious when leaving a balance in ANY exchange.

Damnit man! you want bitcoins and proper english?!?
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:04:56
Yeah,  standard.   sorry man, the banks don't want to deal with any part of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 22:48:49
I run CashIntoCoins, this is what it looks like to us.
Someone counterfeited checks from our main receiving accounts, this isn't new, it has been happening for a few months.  This guy's girlfriend's mom or someone close to him was scammed out of money with a 'cash-this-check-and-western-union-me-the-money' scam.    So whoever accepted the fake check, then just wired the money money to the scammer (who she met online) without waiting for the check to clear. 
It wasn't us, it had nothing to do with us, and I have asked OP to alter the text but he's not really doing much about it.  
Note, you, or anyone else, WILL NEVER RECEIVE A CHECK FROM CASHINTOCOINS publicly listed accounts, they are all locked and do not even allow debits. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 23:53:28
you don't actually keep all of your money at a bank... you know that right?
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:40:02
don't do it.
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:50:58
Yeah... this was bad timing.    We are no longer accepting cash payments for AML reasons.   Just wire, personal checks, and money orders.    I will have an update up shortly. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:38:36
It's not that easy to just jump into.   But more competition is always a good thing. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 01:46:37
You are missing one point, if bitcoin can help these type of marginal companies become more profitable by reduction of processing fees and fraud, then that only serves to increase the value of bitcoin.    
This becomes a test case for other companies, we want this to go well.

damn.  that was quick.

something may be wrong with your email account, but whats up?
@_date: 2014-01-11 06:13:40
pro tip,  you can't earn trust in 3 days.    the law requires merchant services to be able to reverse transactions up to 45 days later,  it takes MONTHS to build up trust.
sorry to hear you got scammed, hope it wasn't too brutal.
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:31:04
Yeah we had to stop doing that this last week.
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:22:56
ZipZap is not really a bitcoin company, they are a payment processor.  They work by acting as a middle man in between exchanges.
They take 3.99% + $5 per transactions plus exchange fees.
I don't think thier send money feature is live but it might be,
They used to have $500 per transaction limit,
yes they require an id and full KYC from the exchange and the user. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:48:26

this is what I am torn on.  Technically any corporation / business as the right to refuse service to any person or other business.   But banking is so ingrained in our day to day lives, its become nearly a necessity.
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:29:55
it depends more on what you what you are trying to implement.  
The Receive payments API makes me nervous because you have to use a third party to accept then transfer the bitcoins, that third party happens to be blockchain, who seems legit, but you never know. Their support is much MUCH better than it used to be.   
The My Wallet api...   works as intended and it goes straight to your wallet, but then you do need to do address management. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:11:15

what they are doing is even shadier.  bitquick.co doesn't actually have people deposit to its own accounts, instead, it gives out the bank accounts of its customers who sell btc to its customers who buy btc. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 07:54:40
i think you mean that they are not synonymous, but they do go hand in hand.  
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:52:07
It probably doesn't matter if you are buying or selling, but if you are doing it for business reasons, ie, buying 20 to spend online vs buying $20 because you are going long, then you might (probably are) an msb.   
Also, there have been a number of prosecutions,  just in the last 6 months there have been at least two that I am aware of but they have been very quiet.    The feds got convictions from a guy in Indiana and are targeting another guy from Colorado.  Both were buying and selling on local bitcoins.

It's not a secret.  It's called the OFAC Specially Designated Nationals List and it's publcily available and searchable.    it's also  a requirement that every Financial Instituionin the United States has to be aware of and are restricted from doing business with.   All of the names on the list have been linked to terrorism.

@_date: 2015-01-27 17:58:17
yes absolutely.    Silicon Valley Bank gives them access to ACH (or at least they were the original provider) however Silicon Valley Bank wont work with any other bitcoin companies and neither will most other banks.  All of the majors banks won't even talk to you and the smaller banks don't have the resources required to handle compliance.
If we were ever able to look hard, I am sure we would see some kind of behind the scene deal that was made.

the government has definitely plaid a role when it comes to the banking side of bitcoin.    Banks just don't know what the feds are going to decide on so they are playing it safe.

you couldn't have enough opsec.  Shutting down an entire operation consists entirely of two steps:

it just shows the value of each economy/market and some arrows pointing to btc.    Which to me would indicate that each of these markets will be moving towards btc.   Even if just a fraction.  But people in those markets aren't necessarily going to move to btc.   Many of those people don't even know what btc is.   But what percentage of those markets and why would they come over to btc.   Basically, I have heard all the hype and i believe that btc is a player and will continue to grow.  but there is nothing to support that btc will actually hit $1000 a coin.

i think its pretty significant that it is already trading in such a large volume.  It is a pretty crazy thing.  I asked a similar question a few days ago and was greeted by a variety of non-factual responses.  The truth is no one really knows whats going to happen but a lot of people are buying into bitcoin and that seems promising.  
That site will give you a bitcoin market estimate.  Its total market cap is somewhere in the 100m range and that seems to say a lot for a made up currency.

this could be a lot of things.  the last two weeks have been pretty unstable.   I am going with the "I am in it for the long haul right now".  There have been a few scams, pirate, and BGSE shutting down.   I am guessing it is just a bit of a sell off.    who knows though.

This is the right answer.  BitAccess manufactures bitcoin ATMs, they have to build in a lot of functionality so that independent operators can run the machines in their own jurisdictions.  The problem is that in the US operators have to abide by the same laws that banks do and if BitAccess or Genesis wants to sell machines in the US, they have to offer the tools needed for US operators. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:22:45

It inherently protects you from it IF you run it locally on a secure environment.  If you use third party services then that protection is nullified and you expose yourself to additional attacks, right?
I just want to be clear so that when some researcher pulls this up in five years they aren't mistaken in thinking that using Bitcoin thoughtlessly on TOR is inherently secure.   What makes it safe, you are suggesting, is the self issued SSL cert by CoinKite. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 00:18:06
BItAccess is just an ATM manufacturer, they don't actually operate the ATMs, you were probably calling the owner of the ATM.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:20:20
Im not questing CoinKite, im questing TOR, you are relaying data through insecure connections.
It's being monitored and sniffed by every 3 letter agency and malicious hackers.  You should never transmit potentially expensive data through tor.

You are completely and utterly wrong.  You are putting your legitimate  sellers in massive danger. 
With just a name and account number, I can look up a banks routing number and print fraudulent checks.   I can use those same pieces of information to set up ACH withdraws, and I can also deposit illegal funds into legitimate sellers accounts and use your service for money laundering including laundering cash gained illegally or using your account as proxies for defrauding other people from their funds. 
Bitquick.co might have potential outside of the US, but inside, holy fuck, you have no idea what you are getting into and you are going to cause a lot of damage.  I feel incredibly bad for any sellers you are duping into a false sense of security. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:50:45
Using Tor for anything bitcoin wallet related is a notoriously danagerous idea.     There are really only a few times one should consider it, and it never involves and api.

Using bitcoin as a currency is a bit like using gold as a currency.  Yes, technically you can pay for things in gold in some places.  But the real value of BTC is the ability to separate your money from governments.  We avoid inflation, arbitrary border checks, send money around the world.  
Yeah it can be used as a currency, yes it WILL be used a currency, but its real value is much higher than day to day spending.

@_date: 2013-06-08 15:20:37
The short answer is, that is already built into the merchant services package. 
The long answer is, anti money laundering laws don't have as big an effect on customer-to-business sales and when a merchant service provider makes a payment to its business customers, it is just that, a payment, usually a check or bank transfer, and is documented by the sending/recieving bank.
It is important to remember that while bitcoin is a new technology, a lot of the things we use it for have been around for decades, or even longer and solutions are already in place for a lot of the issues people are worried about, this being one of them,

the difference, is that in an exchange system, you are buying from pools, not necessary a specific party.  so it can't really be used for money laundering.    but if you have just an otc cash transaction, it can definitely be used for money laundering.

well your merchant service rates are going to vary on a lot of things, credit, business type, provider, card, types card, how the fee was transacted.  Here in the states a 2% merchant service fee is on the low side of average, so unless you are from another country and I do not know your laws, I doubt you will end up with .5%.  
Additionaly, bitcoin offers a wide gambit of benefits over merchant services such as mastercard and visa.    Just some of them include lower transaction fees, higher security with no chargebacks, increased cashflow due to reduced wait time on receipt of funds, security in that they can't be stolen as easily. 
I don't have links handy but the jist of it is that your banker is biased towards merchant services and does not give a fuck about btc or your business's profit.  He/she also does not know what he/she is talking about.

@_date: 2013-10-27 10:09:26
all of them.   most certainly Chase, US Bank, Union Bank, and Citi bank.
WF and Bank of America seem to be the most lenient,  but really if you trade to much it will set off alarms.
I also have reason to believe that both Union Bank and Chase are sharing information about customers and shuttering bitcoin users accounts intentionally.

they do have the capacity. easily.  this was demonstrated a while ago.  A few international universities turned on their super computers and got up to i think 30%? and that was just 7 schools for a limited time.  the us govt alone should be able to pull that off.
the government could also add its capacity to a pool such as btcguild which is already close and hijack the pool to execute its own calculations.

Its basically a one - time use bitcoin gift card.  which is cool, but also not as cool.

thats one of those awkward insider trading events that we really don't want to see.  
I mean if the meeting was something along the lines of..."hey bitcoin is good, we don't really need any extra regulation" and then one of the attendees who had privileged information goes and buys half a million worth of bitcoin and pockets a cool $50k over night, that won't make us look good.  that will just piss people off and bring down more regulation....
Unless it was a member of congress.. in which case its totally cool.

@_date: 2013-10-10 23:26:06
its too much effort working with bitcoiners.  Shitty people complain and businesses don't manage their regulations and it leaves dwolla exposed and then when customers lose out they want Dwolla to handle the hassle of reversing the funds.  It's not Dwolla's job to police the regulations but the Btcoin community demands that they do that.  
So they just said.. fuck it.  I don't blame them.
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:03:13

if you cancel and refresh the page you can get lower fees.  but i tried 10+ times and my 5k order always had 150+ in fees.  I don't really mind, its fast, but its a hefty fee when you have to pay another 1% to buy coins.

That's not how that works. As a US citizen you are required to report all income.  The only way around that is if you have a foreign owned company and you never take any profit out of it but you still have to pay local taxes where the company is held.

There is no way to code a p2p exchange.  The closest we are going to get is ripple.   Which is questionable at best.  Money collection has to be centralized for it to be digitized.  Sure can use services like dwolla or paypal or cash deposits but then you have localbitcoins.com facilitating the actual exchange.

Start small, focus on one key area, and build a small following.   
Building trust takes time, don't be offended when people call you a scammer.  The truth is that some people are early adopters and are more willing to take chances, while others aren't.  Go after the early adopters, make sure they leave happy.   
Handling customer's funds involves regulations, avoid it if at all possible.
Worry about maintaining customer information first.  if you have to ask this kind of questions you should not be involved in that business.  find a way to simplify it.  Again, holding customer data involves regulations, avoid it.
There are a lot of mistakes to avoid.

That is a fair point.  It may be that, but I have had bankers tell me they were not interested in working with bitcoin companies because there was no money in it for the banks.  I hope its a risk/compliance issue because those are eeasy to mitigate.  If it is just some guy upstairs with an opinion, that is more tricky.
As far as the ideas go, I am indeed working on all three.  Multiple banks, multiple accounts as each bank, Working directly with local bankers and corporate bankers, and working to exchange bitcoins other ways.   So we will see what happens.

We are definitely not operating illegally, just some states we are not explicitly legal yet.  We are working on licenses in all of the states and have some locked in already.   It is a bit of a grey area and that kind of bites.
As you mentioned we do run out of coins, that is because if I don't have money in the exchange, I shut the website down.  The idea is that if the banks decide to change their mind, it would be the business that is out of money not the customer, we could still cover all of the customer orders because they money is already in the exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-27 21:13:40
Theft is a problem that every person and business has to deal with, and is mitigated through proper procedures, security measures, and insurance.  
Bitcoin is a sort-off new idea, but everything else that we are working with has been dealt with for a long time.  Bitcoin businesses need to understand that this and not waste time and energy trying to reinvent the wheel just to expose themselves to unnecessary risks in the long run.

Im on my phone but  .the law is pretty clear on transaction size.  If you do less than 1000 per day per person and you only act as a cuurency buyer/seller and not as a money transmitter then you do not need to register with FinCEN.  If you transmit money in any amount or if you sell 1001 worth of btc to.a single person in a 24 hour period...  shit gets weird.    If i recall its chapter 31 of the us cfr subsection 1022...  ill try and look it up tomorrow if you cant find it.

I have a proposal for you.  We seem to have a lot of these incidents where it takes a few weeks to get the ball rolling.  For future cases, how would you feel about being the point person, for a fee, to make sure action is taken sooner rather than later while still protecting the companies ability to make things right.
Something along the lines of, "something went wrong, better start organizing just in case things go sideways."  it might save some people in the future.

I think you mean to say that it failed to happen overnight.  I don't think anyone can argue that communication is more difficult now than it was 40 years ago.  We are much more open as a society because of the internet, and will continue to open up with time.


overnight.  you can't solve problems overnight.  it takes time.  just because there are not flying cars and people living on mars does not mean the internet was a failure.  
but you can use technology to improve the world.   What you seem to misunderstand is the balance of power and how as these tools and technologies become cheaper, it removes the power from the people with the money, and gives it to the people with time and the desire to effect change.  Bitcoin will be the same.  It is an amazing and powerful tool that WILL shape the future and hopefully for the better.  But it takes time and effort.  
I think the argument you are trying to make is that we need better polices in addition/or in place of better technology.  No one will disagree with you, but no one presumes the govt is really fighting for humanity, and so with the proper tools we can fight for it on our own without the use of policies.

I bet if that was your concern, all you had to do was sell it back to your brother.     I don't condone giving paper-wallets as gifts to just anyone, but if you were a decent person, you would have stood there next to him helping him out instead of trash talking him on the internet.

I run cashintocoins.com but I charge 4.5% and give market rates and you can get your btc within minutes.   I do offer a slower service that is 48 hours, for 1.5%.  
If you are patient, I think dwolla -&gt; campbx is the best option.  it will end up costing you about .6% + 25c  but you have to do a lot of extra work because camp bx does not really have the market depth to always support $4000 buys at great prices. 
The third option, i think is localbitcoins.  This is a little risky... but it has worked for lots of people too.   If you do this, just do several smaller transactions in a public place with a well rated person/company.
@_date: 2013-05-06 02:51:37
not dumb, and no I don't believe there is.   i believe its called taint, and has to do with bitcoins being divisible so one part of a coin can be stole and the other legit, and if it were marked as stolen or blacklisted, the whole coin might not be spendable.
I am not an expert, but I recently saw an explanation here on reddit and that is what I remember from it.

There is a lot of money out there to just cut our losses.  one person might lose a few hundred dollars, but collectively the community it out several million.   
It may be prudent for some people to not want to come forward, but there are lots of people who may have just had bitcoins there for legitimate reasons and are entitled to have their property returned.

the thing about mass adoption is that it generally requires the average person to not have to do anything but pay money.  for example, 3d tv's that require glasses will struggle to gain ground, but without glasses and consumers are more inclined to buy. 
Every major adoption has allowed consumers to eliminate some other aspect of their life. credit cards replaced cash, cell phones replaced land lines, cars replaced horse-drawn carriages.  etc.
bitcoin is the same.  the more simple the process is, the better it will be.   So if you want mass adoption for bitcoin...  it has to be more secure and that can't include additional hardware.  mobile apps and web wallets are whats needed and we need to make them as safe and secure as possible.

.onion and tor in general has its purpose.  I use it regularly, as do most of my colleagues and associates.  
just as bitcoin has its purposse.
While the two of them work well together, I don't consider them to be necessary for each others coexistence.    I would use .onion more if it were a) faster and b) more searchable but most of the time I just weigh my need for certain parts of the internet against my impatience and then decide accordingly.
I would run an exit node, if I had any faith in my local pd to know wtf is actually going on.

Great question.   When you deposit into the Wells Fargo account you get a receipt.  Keep that until you get your bitcoins and it is just like any other retail transaction.

Do you have any idea how difficult it is to move money around safely in the united states?   we could have REALLY used an instant transfer service.   In fact, how amazing was it when dwolla was accepted at Mt Gox?  and now the response is 'fuck you dwolla'  ???
@_date: 2013-07-06 03:16:16
Yeah.  The scoop is they changed the way they are handling wire deposits.  Totally messed me up.      
What they were doing was confirming when the transfer was still in pending, now they are switching to a system where they wait until the funds are actually received.  The really awful part about it is that they didn't tell anyone.  They just decided to switch so it is really boning a lot of people.
Expect really long delays from now on.

I don't think you understand the amount of volume that bitcoin moves daily.  $50k is not really that much.

I mean you should know what your sales are. currently or in the future.   dont use grandiose claims like,  "our market potential is virtually limitless"
I try and use realistic expectations, say, .1% of daily trades or 5% of transactions. etc etc. 
its good to know your KYC stuff, but always end with, "I have looked into it, and I believe that we are within guidelines, however I am engaging a lawyer to look it over as we move through the process."

@_date: 2013-09-15 21:59:15
it does two things:
1) feeler bids, when I had my bots running I would use little bids like this to predict movement before I was notified by api. 
2) to drive the price in one direction.  if the highest buy price is 125, and I want to move the price to 126, i might list 100 of these .01's so that the next person who places a  buy order, will list it at 126, despite the depth to 125 is incredibly small.  then I can do it again on top of 126, close the gap and move the price up.

not true.  Banks never take a loss.  the person who deposited the fake bills's account is debited for the amount of fake bills and it is immediately reported to the proper authorities.


This is as illegal as it comes.  If any bitcoiner is doing this, you will get caught, you will have to pay restitution, and it will suck for the rest of your life.

I only serve US residents right now.   I may or may not be in compliance with other governments, however I am in compliance with WA state and federal laws.
I am not a MSB, and do not have to comply with those reporting laws because I only act as an exchange for you specifically.   If I were to send your money to a third party, hold your money in an account, or otherwise trade money for you (series 3 license required for the last part) then I would have to.  But because you are purchasing bitcoins from me, and I am sending them back directly to you, I am only acting as a currency exchange and not a money transmitter.
Now, that being said.  I am working to expand the business in that direction so I am bringing everything into compliance there, but it is a ways off right now.  Maybe mid summer-ish?

yes, external hardware will help for people who want to hold bitcoins. but my prediction, is that most people won;t hold bitcoin.  most people will buy it and immediately spend it.  ie, sr, gambling, online purchases.  people might hold for a few days or weeks at a time, but in the near future (5-10 years) people will use it to buy things online. 
So security is an issue, but only for limited amounts of time.  minutes -&gt; hours.  people wont want to carry around a hardware wallet just so they can use bitcoins.  
That is just my prediction.    I think the hardware wallets are great for hard core bitcoiners, but probably not going to do much for adoption.

I am a btc business looking for a loan.   I think its tricky right now to invest with btc since the GBSE went down.  Most businesses need liquid cash to operate and with BTC's volatility, expectations and profits are really difficult to manage.   But their are companies out there, if you see a business you like, send an email and make an offer or at least open up dialogue with the owner.   Even if you don't get to make the investment you end up learning more about the people and problems they are having.

Man, that totally sucks.  They spent all that money on lawyers and still got it wrong.  
Bitcoins are not a currency the govt is worried about.  They are worried about USD movemtn, the transmission of money for the purpose of buying/selling bitcoin that is money transmission.  
That is the tricky part.   Their only defense is they are not a California business.

your incorrect, let me explain why.  
in your example, the ledger is the blockchain, and the accountant is bitcoin. the accountant just writes numbers into a ledger to reconcile accounts.   he does not accept money into the accounts, or send money from the accounts. he simply tracks the accounts. 
MSBs, actually take and send money. we hire accountants to watch and reconcile our accounts, but we do the work of sending and receiving.

This is just speculation(if anyone knows more than me let me know), but I think bitfloor probably got closed down because of LocalTill.    I don't think they were seperate entities entirely.  I suspect, that your order will PROBABLY be sorted at the same time the rest of the BitFloor stuff is.   Try communicating with the BitFloor company and see what happens.

Link your site.  
three points: 1) if your customers are waiting on payment receipt to activate their product then use bitpay.
2) you could consider giving everyone who signs up 24 hours free while you activate their account.  that way they can set it up and not see any interruption/delay in service.
3) from a business operations point of view.   you can create a default profile for the customer, who can then modify that once they are activated.  
If I were in your position I would opt for some combination of the above to speed up customer access, plus it positions you to take more advantage of the impulse buyers.
@_date: 2013-04-28 06:04:20
but they would have to keep it up indefinitely.  because every vendor would quickly learn not to accept bitcoins during a 51% attack and then miners would move to other pools to stabalize.  a 51% attack is only worthwhile for short bursts, ie, 6 blocks or so.

I agree about all of the companies you have listed, while i think Mt Gox and BTC-e are probably just overwhelmed or at the very least are not custom to english/american civilities, BFL has no excuse for the way they PUBLICLY treat customers.

The exchange is a transmitter, not the trader.  
The gist of it, if you are sending money from one person to another person to effect a bona fide purchase, you are not a transmitter, but the minute a third party comes into play, you are transmitting.  
also calling this a report on bitcoins is a bit egotistical.  Bitcoin is mentioned once in the entire article.

You contact a guy like me, who knows how to do that.  And then I do it, then send you the bitcoins.
I don't know why this is getting downvotes, this is literally how it happens.  If you have a lot of money to move into any currency you contact someone or some company to do it for you that knows the regulations and knows how to navigate the terrain. it's one thing to do it yourself when you are moving a couple hundred or even a few thousand, but more than that there are issues that need be addressed.

god damnit. no your not.  your using tax evasion to evade taxes.   the currency you accept doesnt do shit for your ability to evade taxes.   you choose to pay your taxes.  or you dont.  you can accept credit cards and not pay your taxes.  you can accept gold plated bentleys and not pay your taxes.  you could accept fucking twizzler candy and PAY YOUR TAXES.  the govt doesn't care what you accept as currency, it only cares how much you profit of accepting that currency.
does accepting  bitcoin make it easier to evade taxes, maybe.  assuming that you spend your coins wisely.  just like cash.. even if you accept only cash... they can still bust your for tax evasion.

@_date: 2013-04-09 02:40:57
no one said bitcoin was a certainty.  most of us know the risk, the rest of us should have done more research.
But to to put it bluntly, those of us who know why we are doing this, are doing this *because* of all the reasons you listed.  Bitcoin may very well be one of our last tickets to independence and we are putting it all in, not because of chance of financial freedom in a world that government and corporations own, but because we don't have any other choice.  A few years ago wikileaks announced one of the largest diplomatic cable leaks in global history and at a critical moment, when the whistleblower needed our support, MasterCard and Visa shut down your ability to fund hosting and legal costs.  Global corporations, who you trusted with your money, told you what you couldn't do with it.
Currently, every major money printing government on the planet is in a race to DEVALUE their own currency, because they can no longer agree with each other.   Corporations are stealing your retirement savings, border agents are confiscating funds, banks are being bailed out while the people are getting fucked.
We see that bitcoin has its flaws, that there is risk.  Some people may lose every last dollar they currently have, but dollars can be remade.   We can go to work hard for another few decades, live lite, save where we can, maybe read a few books and get some state sponsored medicare.   But if bitcoin works, if the idea is validated and proves to be useful for the people, the people of the the world.  The whole world.  Every last human being on this planet will have the ability to be free.  We won't have to wage slave, or be told what causes we can support.  You see,  in most of our minds, bitcoin is already at $0, if this fails, we are all kinda fucked.  Because bitcoin is our revolution.

of course.  
imagine on exchange A, you have btc at 120 and 118, and on exchange B, you have btc at 119 and 117.  
So you can buy 1 btc at 117 from exchange b, sell with existing funds on exchange A for 120, and then rebuy 1.01 BTC at 119, for a net increase of ~1%.

I run a business based on that method.    [CashIntoCoins.com](
It is a perfectly legitimate method so long as the person you are buying btc from is licensed and reporting to the proper authorities.  Just be warned, bank transfers can take some time, so some sellers may way until the transfer clears to send bitcoins.   
some questions to ask up front:
*is the person licensed through finCEN
*does the person have a business license in the state they operate
*how quickly will they send coins after you send the transfer
*are their any additional fees that the bank takes.
*what are the limits when sending money.  ie, 750 once a day, 5000 a week, etc
If they are not reporting to FinCEN or the proper state authorities, you run the risk of having the bank account seized and temporarily losing your money.

it is my understand that inflation has 0 effect on debt as long as the debtor/creditor hold debt in the same currency.  If i have 2000 in debt, then it is still 2000 in debt whether the fed prints out no more money or if the presses never stop. 
However, inflation affects purchasing power of the dollar locally as well, so the CPI goes up, and low income people already suffer from their reduced ability to buy bulk so inflation may hurt them more.

I believe bitinstant oversells their position, and while it can be a valid business move, it has it's consequences.  I don't do that, I only take cash for what I have to sell, you can check it out at CashIntoCoins.com
That being said, I believe that bitinstant is well intentioned as well, but demand has really blown up in the last 90 days and most businesses cannot cope with it.

Using other exchanges is good, but if they get to popular, they will be targeted just as heavily as mt gox.   What we need is more exchanges, you have to spread everything out as much as possible.

the uncertainty is the same, because its a percentage and not a fixed cost.   if i have 50 btc of orders left unfilled, then it doesn't matter if its  200 small orders or 20 large ones, its still 50 BTC.

I think its a great experiment for a novice. The point is that anyone can do this, its not easy, but it is valid. And if one random girl from the internet can do it while blogging about it, other people will see that it is feasible and you don't have to be a giant d-bag geek to participate.

Check out CashIntoCoins.com  It is a service I run.  It uses Well's Fargo instead of BoA.  I have served a bunch of redditors already since my launch, over $5,000 USD converted in the first two weeks. I give you the market price at the time of deposit.
Can't fund your account though, only bitcoins, due to Anti Money Laundering laws.

I've had a few meetings with VCs over the last few weeks and while I have not locked anything in, I can share my experience. 
1) they all worried about the legal aspects, now and in the future
2) they wanted to know wtf bitcoins were good for, I made the assumption that because they met with me they valued bitcoins as much as I did, but really my early sales numbers is what had caught their attention.
3) how does this scale, where is the capital going, are they investing in operations or technology
4) back to legal.
I did not prepare any awesome slideshow, but I did make sure I had a firm grasp of my numbers and the ecosystem so I was able to discuss that.

Mt gox'es reputation is shot, people will naturally migrate in and out of the preferred exchanges. 
At this point, I don't think i can hurt to encourage the use of multiple exchanges, but I also think its up to the free market now.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:37:41
I think it uses the mt gox weighted average.   There have been a few horror stories of poorly priced buys from bitinstant during the last few days, but as a general rule, they have been doing pretty well.
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:44:51
awesome!   i laughed my ass off.   I the only moment i cringed was "don't buy bitcoin" and that is really a reasonable assertion at this point for people who would otherwise expect a sure thing.  
He qualifies it with the next sentence, "if you have money to lose and are willing to see what happens, then it is a reasonable *INVESTMENT*"  followed up with the gold comment, people are already equating btc with gold, which is the PERFECT THING IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

You are making an assumption.  Libertarians are not big on paying excessive taxes, but no where in the libertarian party do they say "no taxes."   Most conservative groups don't mind paying for defense or roads, just not social welfare.

d) all of the above.  
spend some some time watching bitcoin and other currencies and you will see what is possible, likely to happen but you will never get it right 100% of the time.
that specific chart, yes there is currently a big wall at 150, yes, if nothing changes, it will be easier to climb after 150, and no, none of that really means anything as at any moment someone can drop their sell order, place a huge market buy order or the market may just not have enough to tear down the wall.
anything can happen,  what has happened in the past, is that this is either going to flounder back and forth just shy of  150 until it breaks, or it will blow off some steam and drop back down a little bit until it regains momentum.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:53:27

you need a bank account to live in this society unless  you want everything to be a little bit more difficult.  Here in the states, you can go cash a check directly from the issuing bank.  usually they charge a fee, 5-15$ but you can do it. 
I live with out credit cards, and I could cut out my debit card, but I need a place to hold my cash, get my paychecks, etc.  its just kind of the way we live now.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:10:05

That's what they all say, everytime.    "there will be another dip right?"  There are always two dips, the first major one and then a second smaller one.  Then its all up.  If you guys did not hit it while it was below 166, you won't.

I tried to find other people who are suing mt gox but i didn't turn up anything with a quick search.
ideally you partner with someone who is already suing.    other than that, get a laywer, file a claim, and settle in for a long process.  You can also file a police report with your local law enforcement so that they can put pressure on the banks and mt gox.

@_date: 2013-05-08 04:55:22
This is a really cool idea!  I like it a lot.   
One question, so I open/download the xls, do i have to send it back to you or does it just autosave in the broswer?    I don't really like downloading things from people I don't know so I haven't tried it yet.
edit to say:  fuck the haters.  Don't listen to the downvotes, you are doing something to improve bitcoin and are learning a lot in the process.  Which is way more than 90% of the other people here.  keep it up.

I can live with that interpretation for now.  I am working on locking in the exchange rate more predictably. I should have a good fix out this month.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:23:11
I charge the market rate for btc.  There is no markup, only the initial deposit.  I am also working on just getting you money into mt gox so you can execute the trades yourself whenever you feel like it.
 
As far as deciding whether its a scam...  you are depositing cash into a bank account and getting a receipt.  If I don't deliver you can always call the cops and they will have my name and information.  I can't think of a safer way to buy btc.
the checkboxes,  yeah I am being overparanoid.  I will work on it being more fluid in the future but at least everyone knows what they are getting before depositing.
@_date: 2013-07-25 05:11:58
thanks,  but how long does it take for them to get the money.  Are we talking over night or 10 days?
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:43:31
No need to apologize, its a fair question.  So you fill out the form, include your personal bitcoin address, and then when you deposit cash into my account, I send that amount in BTC back to you.  Simple conversion, takes less than an hour usually.  
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:53:00
yeah totally riad how they lock your account right?  email support and tell them you need to be able to move your coins to another exchange.

I try to do it first come first serve, but in the event of a huge rush, like monday, where we just flat out run out of coins or in the event of the government stepping in and seizing funds (lets face it, we can play by the rules but Uncle Sam is still Uncle Sam) I wanted people to know how they were going to get paid..   I pay out the smaller orders first then the larger ones...
the reason I do that is because it's easier to manage/refund 3 pissed off customers than 30-40.  It kind of sucks, but I have only had to do it twice,  once this week, and then once back in July when Mt Gox decided to change their polices. 
edit:  I just realized that I should be more clear.  I do smallest to largest in the event that I run out of coins on a single day.  However, I still do Oldest to Newest on a daily basis.  So a $2500 order on Monday will always go out before a $20 order on Tuesday.
the only reason I would even rearrange the order is if I have 200 coins in demand but only 150 available, then I start with the smallest orders and work my way up until I run out.

Check out bitpay,  it is probably the easiest.  You shouldn't really use mt gox's api for handling purchases, even though its possible.  
Depending on what you want to do and how much automation is necessary you can also handle bitcoin transactions manually if needed because the volume is probably not massive right now.

We have a different model similar to coinbase that is not expressly prohibited.  Unless there has been some kind of NY legislation that says "bitcoin is illegal in NY" that i have not seen?
We operate federally as an MSB but because our model is closer to e-commerce (like coinbase) a lot of municipalities are kind of not sure where we fall.  


I don't think there is a person in this country who has read over the rules more than I have.   Both of those companies you listed were doing things that we are not.  And Cassicus was not even ruled to be illegal, FinCEN just issued them a warning that they need to be careful and look into getting a license.  They chose to shut down until their lawyer can look into it.

I think that in the eyes of FinCEN, if you handle both Cash and BTC your are an MSB.  Unless you have something from a laywer stating otherwise.   (if you do, can I get a copy because my laywer says I am a MSB and I would like to know how to get out of that...)

Customer service is an incredibly hard thing to manage because no one will ever care about your customers or your business as much as you do.  So you have to find people with incredible people skills who also give a shit about your business AND are knowledgeable about your industry.
From an operations stand point.. Customer service is the least scalable thing you can do because it's not easy to automate it while still maintaining a high quality.
I am trying to build my business on customer service and it seems to be going well but I am still pretty small.

@_date: 2013-04-17 21:33:06
its a nice thought, but its a terrible idea.
right now btc is still in an early stage and as a result really hasn't reached its full potential.  paying for things in bitcoin is a cool option but definitely not the standard or even preferred way to do things a lot of times  Because at some point, you are going to have to convert your BTC to fiat for everyday life.  
if you have mortgage obligation I would really recommend against agreeing to any kind of contract based on bitcoin prices in the future.
If you have the time and money and resources to gamble on the price going up in the future, then sure, find a tenant who can do that and run with it if they are willing to risk their rent going from $1000 to $2500 like what would have happened if their rent was due on the 10th.  But remember, your business is renting apartments, not speculating on currency.

sure, i need a way to identify and track whose deposit is what.    bitfloor used a system that relied on you depositing a specific amount of cash, which is vulnerable to someone getting the same number.  even if you track it really well, you still run a risk.   but if you do it the way bitinstant and I do it, we can match your deposit directly to your deposit request.   There is no risk of me sending your bitcoins to the wrong person or other issues.  Until the process can be automated at the banks, I don't think it will be able to any time soon, those are the two options that exist.  My takes one more step but guarantees the btc goes to the right person.
Their is one other option that I considered, but I don't have an easy way to do it right now.  But you could write your BTC address onto the ticket and then I could send it that way, or you can write your BTC address on the deposit slip but it would take 24 hours for me to have access to the slip. 
I do encourage you to give it a shot though.  I promise excellent and prompt service and all of my customers so far have liked the service.  Most of them have come back multiple times.

so there are three numbers:
1) the amount you want to deposit
2) the 3.99% bitinstant i going to take from number 1
3) the zipzap/moneygrahm fee     ~$4-$5 on top of the deposit amount.
@_date: 2013-05-01 04:13:15
The simple part is "do you know of any place where I can see this"
I know the analysis part is more complicated, i have made up some numbers based on what I do know but I was hoping to site sources.  Can you think of a clever way to do that with the information we do have? 
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:11:40
bitfloor is closed. sooooooo I wouldnt fuck with anything until you have no money or btc left in your account.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:31:18
File a police report.  Contact the fraud department back.  File a claim.  Send transaction details, a link to the trans, any email correspondance.  You need to fight this, this is a currency exchange and the industry, local coins, bitinstant, and my own service depend on reliability.   
Give me some more info, lets push back here and see what we can do to prevent this in the future.  This is very important.
On a lighter note, if you can get the $500 back you can buy 5 BTC!

a moderate interest rate  of 4%  that gives me just over 40k a year to survive on...  your right, that's not enough.  I mean 300,000 per coin!
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:59:42
seems pretty straight forward. what are you trying to ask?
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:49:44
absolutely none.  However I suspect that Bitfloor and LocalTill were the same company and were not following all the laws.   Because I don't act as an exchange for other people to trade, I only act as currency exchanger, ie you dont have an account with me, you just make a purchase, the laws and reporting I have to adhere to are different and less stringent.

@_date: 2013-09-04 22:26:44
this is the problem with that mentality, your numbers are skewed towards what you want them to be skewed towards.  you are intentionally leaving out mt goxes other currencies and you need to include them if you average is going to be even close to accurate.   
there is nothing wrong with using an average for general curiosity, its a bit like using an index, the only problem is that you can't buy at the average and you can't sell at the average.  it is a useless number for curious people.

it is definitely required if your business is US based.  however the US has no jurisdiction on a company that is located internationally and has no state side presence.  ie, they were able to hit mt gox's subsidiary company but not mt gox directly.

I run a service where you can buy BTC and then fund your mt gox account with those but generally moving cash is rather time consuming and expensive.
If you can be patient, coinbase or campbx are your best options.  Otherwise if you want bitcoins the same day its me, bitinstant, or localbitcoins.com

Your going to need to present a better case than that.  Satoshi squares are not facilitating money transfer, they aren't taking a cut, paying staff, or forming an organized business.  Do any of those things and you are a target, do all of them and no bank will work with you until your registered with AML. 
Your *best* bet is to become a software company whose encryption **CAN** be used for bitcoin trades.  But the minute you touch a transaction its off.

Hey, 
Just wanted to let you know that yesterday I withdrew my available balance from Chase before they were able to lock it, then they went and over drafted that amount from my account... 
and then they charged me the over draft fee.. AND a suspicious funds fee.  
I laughed.  Thought you might too.
@_date: 2013-04-27 00:56:07
I think you are mostly correct.  At least about the transparancy.  I know this is early stage for bitcoin and people understand that there will be problems, but they don't want to be kept in the dark.
About the constantly relocating, maybe.  I do have some safe guards in place that will help me if a bank decides to ultra-risk-adverse on me and I am following some pretty strict laws to prevent having to report as a money transmitter.  
Thanks for the input, we will see what happens.

Yeah i hate to be the guy that says this and I don't want it to be misconstrued as being ungrateful towards the people who put in a lot of time and energy into makeing btc work early on.  
But if you are in the U.S. or in an area supported by gyft, they really are the best option.  They are going to have better service (probably not definitely), better security, and you are going to feel more comfortable with handing them your BTC.
I really do appreciate all the work put in but a better service is here now and a lot of people are going to find their work outmoded.  Myself included if I fail to innovate.
@_date: 2013-05-04 22:23:01

That's the problem with the way a lot of bitcoiners think.  You cant change the whole system at once, you have to bring it along slowly and in bite-sized pieces.  Yes you can do most of the work on linux, but that may come later. 
if you want bitcoin to bite, it needs to be safely usable by a larger demographic than linux users.

Great questions,  there is a lot going on so don't feel bad if you don't understand the full picture right away.
First you want to have your wallet set up.   an easy way to start is at blockchain.info.
Then you buy coins from an exchanger, and give him your wallet address.   The exchanger or BTC seller will send coins to your wallet.
From there, you find a merchant who accepts bitcoin, and then send them bitcoins to their wallet.
Bitcoin is still in the early stages so its cumbersome but its getting better.

from your plan, which i keep quoting, so that you see you need to put more thought into this, if you want to stand out from everyone else who wants bitcoin investments:  


how do you intend to pay for this without taking a cut of the transaction?


all this without a bank?   you will have investors and owners, do you understand how corporations work?  you will have to account for where your money came from.


your going to brand a payment processing solution without touching any transactions?  maybe just throw your 'coinsigner' seal of approval on it?

hey man, if you are interested I run a service getting people bitcoins for cash.  You can check out cashintocoins.com.    basically you just deposit cash or transfer it if you have a wells fargo account and you are set to go.     Only takes 30-60 minutes until you have your coins.
Aside from that, I totally agree that it is forcing people to be more aware.  it also means that we are seeing fewer impulse buys which to me, means that this is less of a bubble and actually legitimate demand.  I mean, if it takes two weeks to buy something, you have to really want it.

I kind of doubt it.  I mean, this is nothing new to anyone who has been around for a while.    the 2011 drop was pretty rough.  But we have been watching these weekly fluctuations for months now.   I bet there is a bit of an uneasy feeling, but no one who has millions of USD in BTC has such little faith in BTC that days like this are any more scary than other days in BTC history.    
Tomorrow this will be over.  And the mt gox queue will grow, with every dreamer who thinks they are smart enough to double their money in the next valley.

Don't buy it for the sake of buying money, you probably wont get you btc back anytime soon as more and more bigger ASICs released make it less competitive.

I thought so too.  I started cashintocoins.com with the exact idea that the process should be much easier.   You can currently deposit cash or transfer money directly to a Wells Fargo account and have bitcoins in just a few minutes.

@_date: 2013-04-15 22:39:02
its pretty simple, 
1)fill out the form on the website
2)you deposit cash into any wells fargo bank
3)send me a copy of the receipt and ill send the coins.
fees are a flat fee depending on the deposit amount.   you can check it out here:  [CashIntoCoin Fees](
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:18:50
All the tickets from yesterday were already sent out.  Did you buddy send in the receipt?
Also, the price in btc is locked at the time you make the deposit, not the time I send the coins.  So if he made a deposit yesterday, then he has coins at yesterdays prices.  Have him email me directly if he has any questions,

its one of my favorite things about bitcoin.   It like the thesis statement for open and free markets, that we don't need nearl as much regulation as we believe we do, and that it IS possible to navigate the terrain intelligently without being taken as a sucker.

they still move more btc than all the other exchanges combined. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 04:25:14
Hey, that sucks.  But you make a very valid point.  Mt Gox does need to step up and decrease their support times.  it is really horrendous for a company that operates 24/7 that they can't provide even same day support.

The same thing that stops most people from paying cash under the table now
... its illegal.  If your numbers don't look right, you get audited, if you get audited and your books don't match, you get fined, have to back taxes,  go to jail or some combination of the two.    
The only reason most people don't pay under the table is the consequences.    Bitcoin doesnt.change that.

What a lot of people don't understand about Warren Buffet is that he doesn't buy stocks or speculate on currencies.  
He buys companies.  That's what he has done his entire career.  He looks for deals or companies that can be maneuvered strategically to perform better than they currently are and then he hires/promotes/retains good managers to run those companies.  
If he had decided to speculate on bitcoin it would be like Bill Gates attempting to run Chevrolet, it's just not his field.

again, you live and play in the bitcoin community, what do you expect?
dwolla is used all over the us, lots of small businesses, apartment and rental agencies, bigger businesses use it for pay bills, a few states allow taxes to be paid with dwolla, and they are rebuilding the ACH system used in the US with a new technology called FiSync which allows instant transfers between banks...  ie, no more 3 day waiting.  Its pretty cool but definitely not going to hurt BTC not having dwolla on board.  if anything, they could have taken advatange of bitcoin.  But still... we are small potatoes compared to dwolla at the moment.

@_date: 2013-05-16 01:16:05
They could have done a lot more, and just because I don't use dwolla doesn't mean I am not personally affected.

hahah yeah, ♥ federal government.   I think you are correct and there is still validity in calling my service a MSB, I know I am walking a fine line, and the goal is err ont he side of caution in the future, but if i had waited to get MSB registered and report on BSA, it is a lot of work for one guy to do so if i dont ABSOLUTELY have too, then I will avoid it for right now.

so if you put in an order to buy 10 btc @ 65 and it takes 2 days to execute your order. and in that two days the buy price is now at 54 and theres lots of movement so your not sure its a good deal.   mt gox will attempt to buy 10 btc at a price UP TO 65, when it has the funds availallb.e  I am not aware of a time limit on that but maybe there is.
however, if the price is 75 instead of the 65 you wanted, mt gox will place a valid buy order at 65 for 10 btc and it wont be executed until the price reaches that level if it does.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:11:43

mt gox is the one doing the buying and selling, if you trade on an exchange your not sending directly to any person.  but mt gox touches it all, so they are the msb.
the problem arises because of the US's interpretation of money transmission.  a lot of people are trying to fight it, but its not getting very far.

i might be able to help out.   but i think you are going to have to trust someone.  there are bunch of things that sound like what you are describing.  
the one with multiple dashes may be a blockchain identifier.  you would need a password as well.
the pneumonic  may be a way to recreate the address.   which also lends me to think this is blockchain.info wallet as they give you both, an identifier and a pneumonic.  
that is where I would start.

why don't you try running an exchange that handles 40 TPS and thousands of other puts and calls that change every other second on top of the individual transactions.  And then, why don't you see how well your exchange holds up to a 50,000 btc being traded 24/7 with peaks up to 500,000 all the while  people are placing and removing orders during that trading.  
And then get ddosed, while activating 20,000 accounts a day, verifying up to 1000 others, handling support, regulatory reporting requirements, multinational banking concerns, and running a good place that does not burn your employees out.  And lets not forget how much money mt gox made last year, hint, it was less than 1 million usd. 
They have made numerous mistakes over the last few months, but dismissing it entirely because their code is bad is a gross misunderstanding of scope of their business.

you hold someone in contempt of court until they release the information.
it would be pretty easy to analyze if someone is a bitcoin user, income, savings, spending levels can be matched up to find that there is missing money.   the same way people analyze that someone is hiding cash.
@_date: 2013-04-30 02:22:28
Hey, yeah, i use the market price to determine a sell value.  I actually don't have any more btc of my own because they are all in my business.
The problem with Bitfloor and localtill is that moving cash from one person to another person via a third party is against the law for Anti Money Laundering laws.  it can be done, but there are a lot of reporting and due diligence issues that need to be managed.
However, If you buy BTC from me, then fund your account with them, everything is on the up and up.
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:16:11

yes, i do. with btc and on mt gox.  the problem is that if you use that as your only form of trading, that bid-ask spread can get pretty narrow.  Only yesterday and today have we seen such huge gaps.   
Now when you do the opposite, sell high then buy low, thats called shorting.  Its a pretty popular term that garnered a lot of attention at the height of the 2008 recension.

Every so often someone brings this up and it gets shot down.  There is no need or use in reclaiming old coins. If we need units smaller than a satoshi we can add that feature into the bitcoin client.   It's not a big deal if people are losing them.  We certainly don't want to reclaim coins accidently.

A story about me being naive:   I was barely 21, super sheltered as a kid.  My first time in vegas.  I saw some guys playing this cup-and-ball game on the side of a street with a HUGE crowd gathered around.  I saw a couple guys play, one lost, one won.   I was pretty clever, I had up until that point made a living out of gambling because online poker was still accessible in the states.  
So i step up, throw $200 down, because when you are gambling $200 is not a lot of money, and attempt to to play.   Craziest thing, I lost!  Holy cow, well whatever, I'll get it the next time.  $300 more on the table, and I get schooled again.  Damnit I think.  Wtf, I never lose twice on these kind of games.  
As I was walking away I realized what had happened, I just got scammed.  On one of the busiest streets in the United States, with US Dollars. And no one was going to help me because no one knew who those guys where.    Fuck, oh well.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:10:24
people know it happens on the major exchanges, what is usually debated is the effect.   there are pros and cons, the majority of the banks and traders say its a great thing, while people who don't participate actively, generally say its bad.
No one one really knows the true effects though because there have not been any real proper test scenarios.  Bitcoin would be a great place to test it, but it would require setting up a control group and no exchange is really willing to take the first step in limiting bots.

Those rigs are so cool....
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:21:57
I don't get the point you are trying to make?  
1) there are plenty of coins, forever and ever.   a satoshi is the smallest unit of coin currently.  But we can alter the code to be divisibile even further if needed. 
2) we dont need a hole coin to make a trasnaction. we can send half a coin or a quarter or bitcent. or whatever.   Instead of thinking about in terms of 1 btc or .5 btc, think about it as 100b satoshi, or 100 bit cents or whatever.

I run a currency exchange, CashIntoCoins.com.  you should check it out.  I can do trades very fast and offer great customer service but my fees are 4.5%.  
But just as a little bit of perspective, calling them extortion fees is hardly accurate.   This month I exchanged just over 16,000 USD into btc, and even with my new higher rates (4.5% with a 40$ cap), I will have only have a net gross profit profit of about $450.  That does not include any business expenses, banking fees, or time that I have to spend dealing with regulations.   There are still a lot of things to work out, but its not like business operators are getting rich off btc.  Its just one more avenue of working with a customer.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:46:04
you can offer, it certainly can't hurt.  Talk to an accountant, make sure you account for volatility, etc etc.
I was thinking about this earlier, unless you are a consumer facing business with lots of transactions, bitcoins doesn't really offer a lot of benefit for b2b transactions.  I mean, a bitcoin payment will never bounce, so there is that guess.

Different mechanism.   debit cards\credit cards use merchant processing.  It actually takes days for it to clear but the banks have a system worked out the card companies.
internal bank transfers are simple and just money moving behind the scenes.  ACH and Wire Transfers actually require approval from different departments and sometimes even require physical cash to be moved to different banks.

I run a service, for people to get cash into bitcoins.   You can either go to a Wells Fargo and deposit cash or do a bank transfer.   I was actually curious if the bank transfer portion will work during out of busines hours, it should as far as I am aware.  i have had several customers do it during regular business hours, but none at night. 
if you have a Wells Fargo account, we could give it a try.  Are you interested?  I would be willing to wave my normal fees and even kick in a little extra btc for letting me use you as a guinea pig.  If not, thats cool too, I just wanted to throw it out there.
if not, the only other thing i could recommend is maybe using bit instant and finding a 7-11 that is open 24 hours that has a Money-gram station in it.

@_date: 2013-04-29 21:45:54
Hey, good question.
I do the exchange based on mt gox's current spot price at the time of deposit.  I am working on getting established to the point where I have a daily/hourly exchange rate but everything is really volatile and if I want to stick around for any length of time I can't hold btc.  I can basically guarantee a price for 15 minutes right now, but that does not mean anything to someone who is going to deposit tomorrow morning or after they got off work anyways.
As far as fees, I just raised them quite a bit over the weekend but my goal is to be competitive.  I feel like I can charge a little bit more because its easier, faster, and I offer better customer service than the other guys.

what is the real value of debt?  
edit:  if inflation increases (ie, the buying power of a single dollar decreases) then it would seem that the real value of debt decreases as well.  my grandfathers $2,000 debt 50 yeas ago is worth significantly less today than it was in 1960 due to inflation.

Thanks for the quick follow up!  lets go line by line:
1) yes, you do not need an account at any of the banks I service because you will be using my accounts with them.
2) no extra fee on top of mine, unless you deposit a check, in which case.. don't.
3) Yes and no, the bank MAY choose to card you for identification purposes but it is up to the discretion of the teller, but the KYC burden falls on me.  If you decide you want to buy outside of our unverified limits ($2,500USD a day), then I can't release btc to you until I have verified you as a customer.  good news is, I have a streamlined process for verifying you that only takes a few minutes.
Let me know if that explains the situation and don't hesitate to ask more questions if you have them.

3) were holding coins there because SR provided a safe and reputable bitcoin wallet

1% of 28b is .028b.   0.28b*20 = 5.6b,  if we invested proportionately the same amount of money into bitcoin as we do into startups,   bitcoins would be worth (5.6b / 11,619,550)  ~$481.91 each.

That is a pretty accurate point.    At some point one of three things will happen:

2) The banks/state regulators decide they don't like our model and force us to shut down. All funds are protected, and we simple cease to exist in the U.S.
3) The banks and state regulators decide that we are not required to get a license and as such we can grow and be merry like every other e-commerce company.  (yay)

according to the CEO of dwolla, bitcoin transactions make up a a fraction of dwolla users, something like 300 users out of every 10,000 are there for bitcoin.   They were doing $1m in transactions a week back in 2012 when bitcoin's total market cap was a fraction of what it is now. 
Not to mention they work with financial institutions to replace ACH with their own tech called FiSync.  Something like 30,000 people in Iowa and Michigan alone use dwolla for paying bills and taxes.  If you stopped a moment to examine what dwolla really is, you would be hard pressed to make statements like that. 
Maybe all the data I am seeing is wrong, but as I read it bitcoin is a fraction of dwolla's business and its a fraction they really don't care to deal with.

they move over $1m a week in general transactions...  as of MARCH 2011.  You might remember, when bitcoin was first valued at a dollar?
@_date: 2013-08-07 16:06:40
That's the only plausible scenario I can see. 
However, I would be fine with taking that risk, but they reversed the other transactions, effectively scamming me out of more money.  I had received yesterday and are now holding all of my funds. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:26:28
yeah it did.  thanks.  I started trying to sell at 45, got out out 41.02  and now it looks like its about to rebound up past that.  :\

@_date: 2013-04-22 17:03:41
I was just reading through that.    What I am thinking of is slightly different.  I would not have access to your bitcoins at all, however, you would choose how many bitcoins you want converted to whichever fiat you chose and then send the coins.  I don't yet have a way to use bitcoins like a bank ( i feel like we should avoid that anyways) but I can help people move coins in and out of fiat easily.  How do you feel about as an initial stepping stone?

You can see the fees @ cashintocoins.com  Its based on the amount of deposit, I try to keep it low and it caps out @ $30 for orders more than 1500.
I don't charge for the exchange itself, I just give you the current market rate at the time of deposit.

as tempting as that may be, it doesn't make sense for this to be an inside job.   Mt gox makes money every time there is a trade, so it doesn't make sense for them to slow things down. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 23:59:12

edit:  its one thing that you logged into mt gox with 2fa and left it open leaving yourself open to xss, but if you had  2fa on withdrawal as well, how the fuck did they get passed that?

Incentive for the businesses is access to a growing customer base for now.  You can add additional incentive later on.


The adoption COULD be large, but just because you build something doesn't mean anything.  I think if you can make this work, it would be really cool.  There is also a demand for micro transactions, for one-read articles behind paywalls and what not.  I think that would make an easy horizontal move that could increase adoption.  ie, they buy to see the article, then get to tip in the comments as well.
@_date: 2013-11-01 04:08:54
I am fairly certain that in the US.  parts of the web are already being censored we just don't know it yet.

@_date: 2013-12-09 18:01:15


services like localbitcoin in the US are dangerous and operate under the radar.  there are no guarantees that you will get your bitcoins except a an anonymous rating system, and what happens if the bank locks the account before you your bitcoins?  Not only is there no guarantee that you will get your coins, but you have no one to contact.
It's a bad idea. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:35:10

You can use my service as well, CashIntoCoins.com.    Let me worry about the laws between the exchanges and the governments and you just get to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-15 22:26:17
Well,  you have to be licensed to do business in the US, tibanne or mutum sigillum doesn't really matter.   The us government is basically demonstrating its reach here, and while impressive, I don't think its overbearing.  have they released a statement on whats happening to customer funds that got stuck in process?
What is interesting is that the US government basically put a kibash on mt gox and we still see that bitcoin, while turbulent, continues to be relatively stable.  Overall, I dig it.    
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:39:04
Of course, I am glad you are taking a responsible interest and not foolhardily jumping in.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:15:46
these are not a potential factor at all.    If mt gox cant handle 200-300 transactions it has bigger problems.  That .02 bot that ran the price up $30 in a matter of minutes was a huge factor of the price making it back up to 170 at all.

@_date: 2013-04-18 05:53:48
great question, sorry for the delay. 
right now, $300 is a flat $7.50 fee.  there is no markup on the coins, i get you the market rate at the time of deposit.   I watch the market pretty close so I am able to get decent deals.  With the relaunch the fees are going up a little bit to accommodate some of the costs new costs, they are all going to a 3.5% fee up to a max of $50.   so basically everything up to $1500 is 3.5%, everything on top of that is free. 
I will also be increasing my free deposit limit from $5 to $10 for people who just want to try out btc, the service, or are looking for tipping money.
I am also looking at adding banks, my intention is to keep offering the cash deposit option at more locations, but a lot of people are enjoying the internal transfer option
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:27:19
Thats not true.  It takes time for things to post to an account, even cash doesn't post instantly.

@_date: 2013-05-09 15:02:23
Also, they just see a wall of text with dollar signs underneath it so its natural for them to skip the important stuff.    You can edit it with headings like **Security** or **Prices** and draw people into the right areas but as whole...  your just going to get hammered.  Sorry!

maybe we can try and send btc to his superpac or something?  is that still around.
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:46:49
One customer at a time.  I have a bit of a reputation her on reddit already, last week I exchanged over $4,000 USD for btc for reddditors.  But ultimately, those savings accounts are linked directly to me, through multiple forms of id, a business license, and my web host, and google.  If I did decide to scam someone, it would be very easy for the law to track and find me.  
I will spring for a more consumer friendly site later on but I wanted to get something up and running in the course of a week while still working a full time job.
PS.  You are the first person who called it minimalist, which is exactly what I was going for given the time constraints.   I can sleep a happy man tonight.    Thank you!

This has bothered me for a while.  And with most things that are magic, I tend to shy away from them.

His assertions have no backing and he has offered no evidence.   Furthermore, even if his statements are 100% true, that does not make bitcoin a scam, it makes Satoshi a smart business man at best and a market manipulator at worst.  But his points are against satoshi, not bitcoin.

It's a great question actually.    yes, you can send bitcoins to a paper wallet.  So you can keep them stored offline but still add to the amount in the wallet.    Just don't lose the piece of paper.

@_date: 2013-04-18 04:11:48
this.  if anyone was really watching the walls over appear and disappear over the last two days they would know it.  
For example, there was over 20k BTC buy wall at 50 less than 48 hours ago. and there has consistenly been 6k+ sell on the upper limits that have been cancelled last second or been utterly demolished in upward movement.  I don't think things are really predicatble right now, aside from in the long run BTC are going up, but its going to be a bumpy road.

that's the point,  they have jurisdiction on us soil, but not everywhere.  will the us allow the rest of leap ahead in the potential future of currency or will they jump on board and let it develop.  
the us could lock it down, shutting down all us bitcoin much like the war on drugs/terrorism (it would be easy enough to make the link), but it would only be the US.  the rest of the world will move forward and bitcoin businesses (and taxes and jobs) will just move out of the country.

If you have a Chase or Wells Fargo account you can transfer my business money directly and then receive bitcoins at the current mt gox rate.  There are no limits like coinbase and it doesnt take 3-4 days, it takes minutes, or at the most 1 business day.
Check it out and feel free to ask me questions.

it makes no sense for businesses to diversify into bitcoin, only for them to accept bitcoin as an alternative payment source provided they can get enough liquidity.  
Bitcoins, as units of currency, don't really offer domestic businesses any real benefit over fiat.  At least if you are a good business manager.  You are only going to keep enough cash to maintain stability and meet current liabilities, the rest is going into dividends, r&amp;d, or other long term investments.  Now, if you are operating internationally then sure, bitcoins offer some other advantages and you may or may not see a company like Berkshire Hathaway using them for purposes such as sending money overseas, but i suspect that if any of warren buffets companies use such a system for funding over seas purchases or investment that Mr. Buffet himself would likely be unaware.
But yes, we do have a long and bumpy road, and it will be interesting to see what happens.  I don't expect any major companies to 'buy into' bitcoin but some may offer additional support for btc users.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:45:12
While I don't deny that is a threat to them...ish.   It really is illegal if not done properly.  Money Service Businesses are highly regulated, which is any business that sends money between people or places.

That is in an interesting observation.  If they are not registered as a money transmitter it could be the cause.  There is a significant difference in what a company does once they get the money.
If you hold a customers cash and create an account for them, you are no longer an exchanger and are a trasmitter subject to more strict laws and reporting.

PM Me or mail me at will and I can get you started.

Hey Ademan,
I run CashIntoCoins.  I started several months ago and the prices have changed a lot, mostly for the best.  I used to charge 4.5% with a minimum of $5 fee.  Orders under $10 used to be free.
But as it's evolved I raised the limit on free orders so that more people can experiment with buying btc, so now its free up to $40.
Let me know if you have any more questions,
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:45:45
Sure it does.  my company is way easier.  and faster.  my fees are higher right now, but that will change soon i think.
CashIntoCoins.com and you can have $1000 worth of btc in an hour, not days.

minimal right now.   Less than 10.  I work full time and spend 2-3 hours a night.  That amount of time is about to go up because now that I have a few more banks I expect more customers.  
But I don't count the amount of time I spend on reddit talking about bitcoin....  because that's for fun.. right??!

It's a real service I launched less than a week ago and have had several happy customers already.   One thing I don't understand is how people believe this is a scam.  Putting money into a regulated FDIC insured bank, where I have to put up several forms of id jsut to open it,  and you get a receipt for the deposit that very clearly links your cash to my bitcoin transaction.    
I would have to be the worlds worst scammer to come up with that plan.

yeah the problem is that it is very difficult, at least here in the united states, for small businesses or individual merchants to do that and be in compliance with the law.

you are left with few other options.  I am sure its an honest mistake, but that does not change the fact that your money, as currently stands, is missing.  
edit-&gt; send another email with something like !!URGENT!! as the firstpart of the subject, it may get more traction.  or !!IM CALLING THE COPS!!. 
really do your best because once the police come in, you may not see your money for a while if they find other cases.

I think its a cool idea.  There is a lot of talk aroudn needing some kind of organized long term storage solution.  Banks, online or otherwise, paperwallets. etc  very cool.

I have been meaning to ask, why are you not using a service such as bitpay instead of handling of coinbase?  Certainly that reduce time and energy necessary to reconcile btc transactions?
In other news, thank you to you and Deimorz for taking the time to give us more information about how its going.  If it helps, I am working on a side project that may help increase btc transactions.

Why do we need a bank in panama, what can we do to work with banks in our own countries to make this work.  if we can account for each deposit and transfer, shouldn't that be okay?
An international bank was my first impression as well, but its not really feasible right now.

400 is small enough :).   go set up a blockchain wallet   bitcoin is made to be used in really small increments, like in the dollars and cents.   in fact, go make two accounts, and send some money back and forth so you can see how the block chain, transactions, confirmations all work together.

I can't be a 100% certain but what I am guessing the trades are referring to are possibly 1) misleading accounting (ie, he really bought at 169, not 178, but you cant see that because it already happend and his accounting method (FIFO) tracks individual trades, not using pool accounting which is the method I use.
or 2) the panic sell triggered an emergency response in the bots failsafe and hes liquidating his holdings without first cancelling his previous buy orders.
Just an educated guess, but like someone else said, without being the bot owner or having a biggger picture view, we can't be certain.

You don't have many choices.  get verified or try another exchange.
It seems a lot of people don't understand what an currency exchange is.  This isn't a fun side project with moderate utility for people to use.  Its a heavily regulated industry that has to comply with multiple federal laws.

don't mean to downvote, but you are very wrong and giving bad advice.   as it stands, anyone who buys and sells (exchanges) btc for cash who is not an end consumer could face severe legal reprocussions if they are not a registered MSB and abiding by all laws.   penalties include fines of up to $100,000 per incident and 5 years jail time.
anyone who uses localbitcoins.com or bitcoin-brokers.org are really risking themselves.

Thanks for stopping by.   I have worked with two people today, and I am working on a way to make past transactions more transparent directly from my sites status page. 
@_date: 2013-08-21 17:48:26
don't do it.   its a pain in the ass and is not worth it for one transaction.  to be honest, its probably not worth it for 100 transactions either.
this is not legal advice and should not be used as legal advice:
but if you were to register with finCEN as an MSB, and the go to section 1010-3X of Chapter 31 of US UCR, you would see that an MSB would need to collect their name, drivers license, ssn, date of birth, address and then verify that information and determine according to the MSBs preexisting and audited company policies that the customer is low risk, the MSB could then exchange the bitcoins, and promptly file a cash transaction report with fincen, assuming of course it was not suspicious, in which case the MSB would also have to file a suspicious activity report, and then the MSB would just have to keep the document for 5 years.
Of course, this is not limited to orders over $10,000, its actually required for all orders starting at $3,000.
again, not legal advice, but you might see something like that if you read through the MSB section of the UCR.

Not to be a downer on localbitcoins,  but if you are in the US, you can use my service, CashIntoCoins.com
Its safe, legal, and fast.  You don't have to worry about getting scammed because all of my transactions are tracked and audited, I am federally regulated,  and I beat the average localbitcoin price by a huge margin. (they have trades up to 200 per btc, I average 133-135.
Either way, I hope your transaction went well and if you decide to buy again in the future I hope you consider CashIntoCoins.

there is a pretty big difference between bitcoin supply and transaction volume.  the sr may have transactions of 1b in USD value in two years, but because bitcoins can be bought/sold /traded several times that does not directly correlate to total supply.
for example, the money supply of the united states is around 3 trillion dollars, but our GDP is about 14 trillion dollars, so on average,  each dollar gets spent just over 4 times a year

Volume and price matter. mt gox gets paid in bitcoins, they make more money when the price of bitcoin is higher, so if they can avoid a massive price drop they make more money.

Hey, 
try r/bitinstant.  You might get some more help over there.  It is important to remember that bitcoins are new and there are a lot of growing pains.  They should be able to at least communicate any issues with you though. 
In the future, if you and your boyfriend are looking for more bitcoins, you can try my service, CashIntoCoins.com.   I am a smaller guy but I serve all of the US, am completely legal, and offer excellent customer service.
