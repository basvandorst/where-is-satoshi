in the US we only go to banks when the buyer is getting a loan for the car and the bank is giving the cashiers check to the seller.

Nah, Teamviewer is just trying to force free users to pay by having this "glitch" occur.

Team Viewer started doing this crap to me the other day too (clearly a massive glitch as dozens upon dozens of people have been hit by this "ban hammer" in the last week based on their Twitter support page) so I said screw them and AnyDesk is the first one I am looking at, I do like that I didn't have to setup an account, but I'm having trouble getting one of my rigs to display on Anydesk, it says it's connected but it never loads the screen, Teamviewer would also regularly load a BLACK screen and it could take several tries or simply waiting long enough for Team Viewer to eventually load the desktop, this is the only thing keeping me from doing the full swap to AnyDesk.

gotta love how people just assume once a criminal always a criminal and you are guilty for everything bad that happens around you. Such an enlightened world we live in, Guilty until proven Innocent.

what did Nicehash need "bailing out" from? the Repayment program has been coming from a percentage of the profits Nicehash makes each month.
