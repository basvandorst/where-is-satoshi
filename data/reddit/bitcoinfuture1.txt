Hmm, I think someone is doing a lot of buying at a certain level and dropping them big time. I think this is being manipulated. I'm wary because A huge crash can happen because of this. 
Now remember i'm not saying bitcoin is dead because it's not, it's the future, but be wary short term. it's not long ago we were below $4000
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:07:43
I'm an early investor in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-04 21:13:15
Well done dude. Ignore all the negative comments. This is a good thing in your life and you should be proud that an investment got you this car. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:43:18
Lets be honest now to the big players, bitcoin is so cheap that they could buy the whole lot and then control bitcoin's price etc. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 21:44:01
Bitcoin is so volatile that I think many financial advisers would stay away from advising to put money on this market. Personally I think we'll heading low, and no we haven't hit desperation yet. Desperation will hit when we hit $4000, that's when we start seeing the bulls on youtube start talking desperately and even advising to sell. That's when we hit desperation. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 22:29:46
Quite bias, it seems only guys over 6 foot had success with bitcoin, and us short guys all missed out and are now delivering food LMAO.
@_date: 2019-03-17 12:38:13
I know what my understanding is, i'm just wondering what the characters mindset is. I'm intrigued. I want to know more about what made him different to others that made him want to invest in something that many laughed at. What potential did he see? I know the potential I saw, but as a movie, I want to know more about him. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 11:33:33
Early investors never got into bitcoin because of how much money it would make them, they got into bitcoin because they disliked how fiat money works, and they were excited how this new technology actually works.
The people that got into bitcoin for money mostly got burnt, and are still getting burnt to this day. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 20:33:37
Didn't like it. I felt it was all just about money. How does a man in the street even afford so many bitcoin? He talks about potential, what potential? He just screams he's now rich, but what was the potential? What did he see in bitcoin for him to invest such money? I think it would of been a better short movie where he's debating with someone the potential of bitcoin, and then invests. This doesn't teach no one nothing apart from bitcoin making early investors rich.
@_date: 2019-03-18 13:06:48
Is asking questions wrong on this forum? Is being intrigued wrong? I asked what potential did the character see, and all I get is flack.  Quite shocked as I expected most of you guys to be visionaries, the type of people that observe and predict how they see the future to be. Some of you might not of liked banks. Some of you might of been computer programmers that saw hos sophisticated the blockchain was. Some of you might of heard from a friend and just went in because it seemed fun and cheap. Lots of people got into bitcoin for a various reasons, and i'm just wondering as a viewer what did that character see as a potential in bitcoin. Why such hatred for an intriguing question?
@_date: 2019-03-16 17:11:53
As a film, I would like to know what was the thinking behind the man that saw the potential in something that many didn't. It's not a documentary i'm looking for, it's curiosity. You talk about potential, well as a viewer, I want to know what is that potential, and personally I thought the investment was the fundamental basis in this short movie. 
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:00:05
First thing I would do is see my late family members and spend some great family time. I would invest in bitcoin, but they'll be more important things to do than that first. Money is not everything, well to me it's not.
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:23:12
For me personally, it would be an important part of the movie. The movie is about an investment, that's the main part of the movie, therefore regarding why a person chose to make that investment is also a very important part of the movie. A person can not make their own assumption of why a person makes an investment, because the knowledge on that investment might be very limited to that person. 
@_date: 2019-06-04 11:14:19
I would never tell a friend to invest. I would just say i'm buying and it's up to him to buy, and would tell him the risks etc. Shit otherwise could get nasty if it went down in price and money can cause breakups.
@_date: 2019-02-03 01:21:45
Well it all comes down to confidence. confidence in banks etc decline and people start investing in new form of money. You got to remember of why was bitcoin invented in the first place, because that's what will take it off again.
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:05:48
Just explain it in a way that you would explain it to a child. Make it simple. The question is how knowledgeable are you on bitcoin because he could come up with questions that make you look stupid if you don't really know what you're talking about. 
I personally just said to my family that I'm interested in crypto because I don't like the way the money system is due to it's debt. I didn't really go into detail about bitcoin, because I personally don't want people to invest in bitcoin because of what I said as if they lose money it'll come back onto me. Be careful.

People are greedy. 1) Only invest if you believe in the project. 2) only invest what you can afford to lose. 
The problem is you got greedy individuals who see the rise and fomo to try and make quick money. I have no sympathy. Just buy when you can. No need to go all in.
@_date: 2019-04-10 23:42:10
Why does it bother you what others think? This is your investment not theres. Be careful who you advice to buy bitcoin, because when it goes downhill you'll be the scapegoat, and if it goes well, then they'll be the genius. Just concentrate on your own investment, and only buy what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-12-28 14:45:18
A load of rubbish.
@_date: 2019-12-28 15:05:55
Well bitcoin was created by the last recession. Are we heading for a recession or a total depression? The federal reserve have been pumping money like crazy, such as the repo market, and even banks now are getting worried about loaning money to other banks. The deautche bank is the bank I'm keeping my eye on. The last recession started in america, this one could start in europe. I would keep cash. Already have gold and bitcoin. The main key is dont go low on cash. Cash is king in a recession so you dont want to put yourself in a situation where you have to sell. I think the price of bitcoin will go down at the beginning. You're going to have a lot of individuals who'll have to sell. Itll be after that the price goes a lot higher after the "normal" folks have to sell.
@_date: 2019-04-10 23:46:16
I wouldn't of bought it in bitcoin, but congratulations. A pretty ring for a pretty women. ;)
@_date: 2019-04-15 10:31:29
The truth is though is that it's not that easy to deal with bitcoin yet, but it's a lot easier than it used to be. For a person to make an account, you got to give a lot of security details on websites, details that people are wary to give out. You then hear about wallets etc to keep your money safe, while banks are insured to keep your money safe by the government. While I do believe crypto is the future of money, you still have to realise it's still in it's early days.
@_date: 2019-04-12 16:41:46
The technology is still new, but in the end it is my opinion that the world will start adapting to bitcoin, because they will have to. You can only deny it for so long, and it'll get to the point where even the banks etc will start adopting crypto currency. First was denial, then became the realisation and next will be acceptance.
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:21:07
Wow, you lot really miss the point don't you. This video is showing the mindset and mentality of bitcoin 7 years ago. People were saying that bitcoin would never be accepted by the government etc, which was my opinion at the time as well, and look what bitcoin has done since.  We are heading for a crash, but guess what? This crash is needed and bitcoin has been through many crashes in the past, but has always done better on the bull runs. 
Stop talking about the movie and start focusing on your investments. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:16:09
The big problem is money printing. I mean we all would love to just print money when we're a bit low, but we know we can't, and if we could, we would just spend. Oh, well that's what the problem is, the fed etc are printing, and therefore are just spending. When you print money out of nothing, you really lose focus of all the money. For example, a day before the disaster with the twin towers, Rumsfield spoke about his disgust of 1 trillion dollars that the pentagon couldn't account for. Basically 1 trillion dollars just went missing. Next day the pentagon was hit and we're at war. I'm not saying that's the reason, but when you print money out of nothing, you get careless, eventually carelessness will get to you.
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:09:43
Government will have no choice in the end but to accept when there's anarchy on the streets. Maybe even a political leader might even win by ridiculing the banks. Donald Trump won the election because of people's anger towards immigration. Can't see why another leader can't win an election because of people's future hatred towards banks.
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:24:39
Very possible. So you're looking for a coin that can do high demands with low energy consumption. Any ideas? 
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:49:45
It's a situation that certainly gives crypto trouble, but it's early stages. It's only ten years old and as technology improves, it could provide the amount of energy needed for us to adapt. I'm sure bitcoin won't be the coin that'll be used in years to come, but it will be the forefather that'll allowed the of evolution of crypto to take place.
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:53:05
Have the banks worked out what happens when the interest rates go up? How many can afford their mortgage then? Look the whole system is going under, it's not if, it's a question of when.
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:13:46
Look guys and girls, I know we don't know for certain what the future will be like, what i'm asking is for you to picture how the future will be like. Think outside the box. For example I can tell you we're heading for a huge financial crash. The signs are there. People are living way out of their means. Bankers are still gambling and drugs addicts. The signs I think show there's going to have to be a huge shift in how finance works. Money is worth what people are willing to pay for it. When people find out that banks don't really have their money, faith in that economy sinks down the drain. This is a vision. It might not happen, but I believe chances are it can happen. 
What's your vision? How will bitcoin be that saviour? Will it be a saviour? Will finance never change, meaning bitcoin will just decline?

You need a bank to buy the bitcoin. How else do you buy bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:26:33
Well i'm just saying that the first bank no longer has it's cashiers, and told me to go to another branch. This is all because I want to give them a few coins. I basically interrogated the poor women of why they seem reluctant in taking coins. She just said that a lot of coins don't get circulated any more because a lot of people now use cards and not cash. I said well you need coins for change for notes, which she said change is in low demand. This is when I said i'm getting the impression that you're telling me we're heading for a cashless system, which she said, i'm not saying that. It's only when I carried on communicating to the women about coins that she said it seems that theres going to be big changes in the future of how we work.  I took her word for big changes because the cashiers in my local bank are gone, which in itself is a big change of how the staff work.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:30:22
Money is easy to get, paying it back is the hard part, and something I would never get into. It's a great thought to be able to take out cash loans, invest in something that can make you a ton of money, but truth is, if I can't afford to do that investment with my own money, then I can't afford to invest in the first place. I'm not going to be like the others and be " owned" by a bank. My lifestyle is very cheap. i don't drive. I don't smoke. I don't drink alcohol. I have no need for the latest phone or TV, and what this allows me to do is not having to rely on others to give me a lifestyle that is beyond my means. Unfortunately I am part of the very few, which is why the whole show will be over in the near distant future. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:07:03
If you believe the technology is flawed and can never reach it's height because of those flaws, then you're not over reacting, hat's an educated decision, but a lot of people are basing their opinions on price alone. This crypto world we're putting money into is still really early in it's life. You got to ask yourselves, where we be in 10 years time. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 11:23:01
She could be bullshitting me, I don't know. All I do know is one branch got rid of it's cashiers, and i'm also noticing a lot more people today are using cards, not cash. So that part of what she is saying is most certainly true, because i've also noticed that pattern.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:34:55
What has changed so much in bitcoin for the value to drop so much? The answer is nothing. The fundamentals are still there. You needed this shake up to happen to get rid a lot of the weak coins that are just not good enough to progress through the evolution of crypto. The financial situation around the world is even worse today than it was 5 years ago. Debt is still increasing to a unsustainable amount. The foundation of why bitcoin existed still exists today.

Don't feel sorry for me, feel sorry for all the individuals who's life are going to be totally destroyed in the near future. The replies on this Reddit unfortunately just makes me more confident of how big this crash can be. Too many people are turning a blind eye on these problems, and this is a huge problem that will eventually hit everyone. No point screaming when it happens, you have to prepare yourself before it happens. You have to save yourself, the banks are not going to save you.

The problem with most of this is that the Americans keep thinking of their own economy etc when talking about a financial crash. The next huge financial crash might not even be triggered in America. It could be Europe that triggers it and eventually you'll feel the ripple affects, like we in England felt it last time. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:37:22
To everyone that says don't take her seriously because she's just a cashier. Look, you don't have to be at the top position of a job to notice patterns. For example, a burger king cashier could tell you what burger is more popular etc, because in their experience they've noticed a pattern. This cashier lady could be telling me a lot of rubbish, but considering the other branch has stopped it's cashiers tells me that the bank has fully well noticed that people in general are not using cash, and the lady has most likely very well noticed how the financial system is playing out because she's dealing with people's finances every day and therefore noticing a pattern.

Bitcoin never went to $1000 in 2015. Time traveller was correct on all other accounts though, which is impressive if no details were edited in those 5 years.
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:16:55
Because a large percentage of people are already naturally using their money digitally with their online accounts etc, getting used to not actually holding cash visually. Also paying by cards increases chances of people getting into debt, as it's easier going into debt when you're not actually holding cash, not visually keeping an eye on what is available to spend. It's most likely why the next financial crash will change the financial world as we know it. Basically more people paying by cards increases the chances of mass adoption to bitcoin IMO. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:47:46
if the price keeps going up and down like it has been, then I can't really see no business accepting bitcoin because every second it seems to change price. Imagine going to a shop to buy a £1 drink, and the shop keeper goes, "oh that'll be 90p, oh no sorry that'll be 95p, oh sorry that'll be 80p".. You can't have these fluctuations if it's going to be a real currency.
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:30:20
Like everything has been said. Once interest rates goes up, then people with credit card debt, car finances, well they're paying more in debt, and it'll get to the point it'll affect mortgage payments. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:02:34
You're not alone. I don't have no debt, but the higher percentage of people do, which is why the economy is going to fall. Economy falling is what could make bitcoin go to the moon if people start not trusting the banks.

What the hell are you doing putting your half your wife savings into something she didn't give you permission for you to do. I would be fuming if my wife did that. I would be fuming even if she made money on it, because how can I trust her with the money if she just uses it whenever she wants? 
Look, in the future if you're looking to invest, then a joint account is no good. Invest your money only, then your wife can't say nothing. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:34:02
Well There will be some big changes to how the world deals with finance, because the fiat way doesn't work. When the financial world collapses, which it will because the banks are gambling addicts, and the regular person lives way beyond their means. I'm just trying to picture that future before it happens. How will bitcoin be part of that future when the bank will just say our new crypto is the answer to the problems, and that you're insured for a certain amount if it gets stolen etc.
I do believe crypto is the answer to the problem, because the reason we're in this mess is because we're able to print cash out of nothing, which is just not sustainable, eventually enough is enough. Debt can't keep going up and up. A crypto or a financial system where money can't just be made is the answer, but how will that happen when the banks will not profit out of it. 
What is the future in your head?
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:51:16
The author doesn't really explain what is " The Great Reset".. I've just read a couple of his articles, and he just goes on about debt increasing to an unsustainable amount and that big changes will have to happen. Well we all know that.  When he says big reset, it kind of implies that the debt will just be resetted, but he admits that this can't happen because that won't be allowed. 
In my eyes the only way a reset can happen is if fiat is overtaken by a currency that can not be manipulated and printed out of nothing. Do any of you know a currency like that? I'm trying to get my head around it.
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:33:03
Well You kinda can. Some actually made a lot of money on the 2008 financial crash by pinpointing what was going to cause the crash " before it happened". 
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:51:04
No, because bitcoin might be one of those 99% of coins that eventually dies for a more efficient technology to take over. Remember this is technology and technology evolves. Just because bitcoin was the first doesn't mean it's the best coin. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:16:44
There is one problem.. people. You see we're very selfish people. People on average only care about themselves. They don't think about the future, they think about now, and only what benefits them now. The transactions fees being higher is something that will most certainly slow the progress of bitcoin, possibly even allow another coin to take over, because people, no matter how good something is, they don't want to pay more money in transaction fees and therefore would prefer to use a bank, or maybe even another coin. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:10:02
People would benefit from bitcoin, but governments are controlled by banks. Why will banks adopt to bitcoin without profiteering like they're able to do with fiat money? The only way I see an adoption is if the whole financial system crashes to the point where banks no longer have trust and that people demand something different. Bankers go to jail and finance as we know it has to evolve where it can't be manipulated to prevent the mistake from ever happening again. Governments won't want to do it, but could be forced to do it to prevent total chaos, where even the governments are threatened.
@_date: 2018-11-26 10:42:23
Of course this is going to happen. like any business, if the funds stop coming in, then companies have to make cut backs and maybe even face bankruptcies if the price does not get any better. The problem with bitcoin is the amount of electricity it consumes to mine. 
The truth is though is that we're heading more into an electrical world. Cars will be powered by electricity, same as our homes, internet, banks, so you might as well include our total economy on that list. As a technology we just have to get better at being able to enhance electricity to be able to consume more, because that's where the future is heading. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:50:47
Well i think Crypto currencies are the future, but not sure if bitcoin is that future. There are huge flaws in bitcoin at the moment. It's transactions are too slow. The price of transactions are way too high, and the price of mining is too expensive due to the amount of power it consumes. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 11:10:49
What i'm saying is shop keepers are going to be wary of dealing in bitcoin if the price changes so much. They just want to make profit, how can they make a profit if in one day bitcoin can drop say 8% in value. The fluctuations are a big problem at the moment in the sense of businesses adopting bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:55:30
What you have to remember is that bitcoin was created as a result of the financial crash of 2008. A lot of angry people in 2008 that felt wronged by the financial situation caused by banks and wall street. People are happier today because they're allowed to live their extreme lifestyle that is given to them by finance from banks. When the money comes crashing down, which it will, then people will come rushing back to crypto, especially as the next financial crash will make 2008 look like a baby. Faith in banks will come to an extreme low.

Is it? Vision is most likely the best tool you can have when it comes to investing. A vision of what you believe will work, a vision of the potential on whatever you're investing in. Some of the greatest minds had a vision way beyond your regular person, and profited on that vision. Warren buffet only invests in stuff he knows, but he still had a vision of why he believed certain companies were better than others. 
We know from the past that our economy has high's and collapses. This time though with the internet people are more connected than ever before, which increases problems for the government when problems arise. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:42:23
He makes some very good points. He's talking about what the possible block chain technology is capable of. There's a lot of things in the past that we were capable of achieving, but never did because of money. For example, Tesla could of given us all free electricity, including the very poor, but this was prevented because of money and power. Bitcoin can achieve so much, but unfortunately it can also be destroyed. At this very moment of time people only seem to care about the price of bitcoin, and this is where bitcoin can be destroyed. It costs a lot of money to mine, and lets be honest bitcoin is not that expensive for the very rich to buy in lets say late 2017, and then just dump it to manipulate the bitcoin market. This is one easy market to manipulate.

The problem with fiat is that it produces money out of nothing, where the money can't be traced. For example the pentagon have lost trillions of dollars. Trillions of dollars over time that would of been enough to pay of the US debt. At least with crypto currency is that only a certain mount of coins can be produced, which means we can't spend what we don't have. The money is going because the dodgy people at the governments are not telling us the truth of where the money is going. The fed is privately owned, and they have the power to buckle the whole government, even the whole world. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:41:33
Well my advice for anyone watching this. This is very basic but so important. 1st step would be to obviously have no debt. If you are in debt, then get that debt down. Lower your lifestyle. You don't need the latest phone. You don't need the latest car. You don't need to showoff your accessories. You don't need to keep eating out. The ones who like their lavish lifestyle, who live way beyond their means will be first to drown. I spoke to one of my friends who just got a loan to buy a brand new car. He's also just got this " best phone" as he calls it. He'll be in big trouble. He calls me a cheap skate. 
Step 2.. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Meaning don;t be stupid. Don't invest 90% on an investment, because you first must accept that you can be wrong. 
In regards to Cyber currency. I do believe Cyber currency is the future, but not certain if it's bitcoin. Bitcoin seems too slow and transaction fees seem too high for it to be a currency. It is still in it's early stages though.

The big problem is how can sellers trade with a currency like bitcoin. How can amazon trade their items in bitcoin when the price is so volatile? Amazon and ebay sellers would continuously every hour have to change the price of their item because bitcoins price can drastically change in half an hour. It's a great technology that's still in it's early days that I believe will be adopted, but we're way off that mark because of the volatility that surrounds bitcoin, and the chances are it's going to increase in it's volatility in the near future because fiat is in a very dangerous position at this current time.

A stupid thing to do. Some people like to brag they have some bitcoin, and it's those people that in the end will have problems.

Fiat won't die just yet, it's just that debt will once again increase for the inevitable to eventually happen.

Yeah, that's what I heard, which is a huge problem in itself.

That's a huge problem. I heard that mining costs will go down as the price of bitcoin decreases, but problem is it takes longer for the miners to see the difference, especially when the cost of bitcoin decreases by a huge amount so quickly.

He's shorting. It's the opposite of what we're doing LOL

Trust is the main obstacle. Trust is basically everything when it comes to currency. You have dollars that you trust the next day you could spend in the shop and spend that same amount the next day. If the price varied too drastically, you most likely wouldn't want dollars, you just wouldn't trust it. At the moment bitcoin is in it's early technology days. The price varies too much for it to be adopted at this current time. I thin it takes another decade before it's more adopted.

While I love the technology of bitcoin, the thought of the rich not dominating it is a bit naive. Of course the rich can dictate the price of bitcoin even more comfortably than they could the stock market due to the lack of regulations etc at the moment, and also because it's limitation. The reason you should buy now is because it'll be near impossible for the working class people to afford an actual whole bitcoin. It's  getting hard for the working class to afford one now, in just one year time it'll be so much harder.
