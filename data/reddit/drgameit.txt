Oiga amigos! Oiga amigos! Paco! Enrique! 
 Last words of Hassan Sabbah, 
 The Old man of the Mountain! 
 Listen to my last words, anywhere! 
 Listen all you boards, governments, syndicates, nations of the world,
 And you, powers behind what filth deals consummated in what lavatory,
 To take what is not yours , 
 To sell out your sons forever! To sell the ground from unborn feet 
 for ever? for Eve-R
 Listen to my last words any world! Listen if you value the bodies
 for which you would sell all souls forever! ... 
 I bear no sick words junk words love words forgive words from Jesus
 I have not come to explain or tidy up
 What am I doing over here with the workers, the gooks, the apes, the
 dogs, the errand boys, the human animals? 
 Why don't I come over with the board, and drink coca-cola and make it?
" now for God's sake, do not let that Coca-Cola thing out! "
 Thing is right, Mr Whoever is responsible for that who done it! 
 Explain how the blood, and bones, and brains of a hundred million
 more or less gooks went down the drain in green piss! 
 So you on the boards could use bodies, and minds, and souls that
 were not yours, are not yours, and never will be yours. 
 You want Hassan Sabbah to explain that? To tidy that up! 
 You have the wrong name and the wrong number! 
 Mr Luce Getty Lee Rockafeller
"Don't let them see us, don't tell them what we are doing! "
 Are these the words of the all powerful boards and syndicates of
 the earth? 
"- Don't let them see us, don't tell them what we are doing!
Not the cancer deal with the Venusians, not the green deal!
Don't let that out!
Disaster, disaster, unevaluable disaster!
Don't show them out, these things take time and that's my business."
 As usual, Mr Luce! Short time to go. Minutes to go! 
 Blue heavy metal people. 
"- Don't let that out! Don't show them the blues!"
 Are these the words of the all powerful boards and syndicates of the earth? 
"and don't whatever you do let them see us. "
 Crab men! Tape worms! Intestinal parasites! 
 Squeezing the air you did not shit it out and eat it again, forever! 
"Don't let them see us! Don't tell them what we are doing!"
"Don't let us pay"
 Are these the words of the all powerful boards, syndicates, 
 cartels of the  earth? 
 The great banking families of the world 
 French, English, American? 
 Like Burroughs, that proud American name? 
 Proud of what exactly? Would you all like to see exactly what
 Burroughs has to be proud of? 
 The Mayan Caper, the centipede hype,
 Short time racket, the heavy metal gimmick? 
 All right, Mister Burroughs, who bears my name and my words burried
 all the way 
 For all to see, in Time Square, in Picadilly, 
 Play it all, play it all, play it all back! 
 Pay it all, pay it all, pay it all back! ... 
 Listen : the word comes before English American German French,
 and pain and live are arsenic for all
 now the bones went - use never you have light
 all of you all all all green people crab people blue heavy metal people,
 compliments of mr burroughs for the heavy metal gimmick
"'don't let them see us don't tell them what we are doing
Premature premature reconversion reconversion blues"
 Shall I show them the blues? 
" No! Now! No! "
"Premature! Premature! Premature!"
 Are these the words of the all powerful boards and syndicates of the earth?
 I say to all : these words are not premature . These words may be
 too late. 
 Minutes to go. Minutes to go. Minutes to goo ; Minutes to green goo.
 What I have to say is everywhere now
 Rub out the word two and you rub out the word Hitler
 The answer comes before the question
 my words are for all - for all, 
 I repeat for all! 
 No one is excluded! 
 Free to all who pay , free to all who pain pay for all to see
 for all to see! 
 In Picadilly, in Time Square, Place de la Concorde, 
 In all the streets and plazas of the world! 
 Pay, pay, pay! 
 Play it all, play it all , play it all back! 
 Pay it all, pay it all, pay it all back! 
 See my writing the silent -  across all your skies, 
 The silent writing of Brion Gysin - Hassan Sabbah. 
 All out of time! All into space! Forever! 
 Take what is not yours to skies squeezing the eye bodies forever
 All out of time! All into space! Forever! 
 you cannot take words into space
 that is all all all Hassan Sabbah
 you cannot take woman into space
 I repeat you cannot take woman into space
 that is all all all Hassan Sabbah
 See my writing silent -  across all your skies, 
 The silent writing of Brion Gysin - Hassan Sabbah. 
 The silent writing of space, the writing of Hassan Sabbah 
 Look Look Look!
"Don't let them see us! Don't tell them what we are doing!"
 Are these the words of the great nations, the all powerful boards
 and syndicates of the earth? 
 These are the words of liars, and cowards, and collaboraters and
 traitors 
 Collaborators with insect people, 
 With any people anywhere who offer you a body forever, to shit
 forever. 
 For this you have sold your sons forever, 
 The ground under unborn feet forever! 
 Traitors to all souls everywhere! 
 You on the board, who want others to pay for you, 
 With your deals to take what is not yours! 
 And leave your human animals to be eaten alive by the crab ppl
 to go down the drain in green shit and piss. the green deal
"Don't let them see us! Don't tell them what we are doing!"
 You on the board, who now say : 
"Protect us from our our gooks
Protect us from our human animals."
 Are these the words of the all powerful boards and syndicates of the
 earth? 
 And you want the name of Hassan Sabbah on your filth deals 
 To sell out the unborn? 
"Protect us from our gooks, our dogs, our dogs our human animals!"
 Are these the words of the all powerful boards, the all powerful
 syndicates 
 the all  powerful governments and nations of the earth? 
 Liars! Liars! Liars! Cowards! Cowards! Cowards! 
 Who cannot even face your own dogs! 
 Traitors to all souls everywhere! Sold out to shit forever : 
 You, miserable collaborators, 
 Now ask protection of Hassan Sabbah? 
 Are these the words of the all powerful board?
"Protect us from our gooks, our human animals?"
 No, no, no, I will not protect you, 
 And you will never use the name of Hassan Sabbah - William Burroughs
 to cover your green shit deals with crab-men. With the Elders of Minraud.
 Listen listen listen:
 I rub out all the words and reports of the board forever
 I rub out your thin glees for ever for eve - r
 I rub out the words of marx lenin einstein freud fraud forever
 I rub out the formulaes of einstein oppenheimer forever
 I rub out their words forever
 I rub out the Qabalah forever
 I rub out the Talmud forever
 I rub out all the formulaes and directives of the Elders of Minraud forever
 I rub out the word forever
 listen all all all
 if you I cancel all your words forever
 you cannot take words with you into space
 it is all all all Hassan Sabbah.

FINALLY a realistic incentive for merchants to accept Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-07-26 21:14:19


SEEMS LEGIT
@_date: 2014-07-12 16:51:37
Really interesting idea!
@_date: 2014-08-10 01:03:28
I think at this point are just trolling @_date: 2014-09-22 11:13:38
Yes that's a great way to philosophise away the fact that bitcoin is somehow still 'in beta' 5 years on whereas most successful companies/phenomena on the internet have shot from obscurity to ubiquity, and millions more users that bitcoin, within a few months at most
@_date: 2014-02-06 09:56:14
Nuke it from orbit
@_date: 2014-03-03 05:05:50
Just use bitcoin for the things that would work well if it's a currency/investment and not the things that would work well if its a pyramid scheme or religion.
@_date: 2014-07-12 16:51:05


How fast are you expecting this packet radio thing to be ?
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:05:22
Extremely well said.
@_date: 2014-09-12 10:13:00
Nice! :) I might actually buy one if/when bitcoin goes up :)
@_date: 2014-09-23 09:45:21


@_date: 2014-02-10 17:05:42
Even if bitcoin becomes the one world currency in some libertarian dystopian future it will NEVER STOP being funny
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:35:25
YEAH i mean theres no way they could have registered a new .com for like $10 and named it something more suited to the main exchange of what's supposed to be an entire currency that'd be ridiculous
@_date: 2014-09-19 09:14:45
The next two ~~weeks~~ years will be critical
@_date: 2014-07-06 20:50:38
...unless you ever read any reddit thread ever.
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:33:55

...it's still a joke.
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:01:22
Has there been any explanation who this nakamotodragon guy is supposed to even be, apart from a way for some reddit youth to avoid the effort of having to pretend to be a specific middle aged guy for *too* many posts?
@_date: 2014-09-07 02:38:52
I'm sure in the very unlikely event that bitcoin becomes mainstream popular, unregulared bitcoin middleman companies will NEVER try to upsell  
@_date: 2014-09-12 08:35:24
Then evidently there's a powerful interest in not downvoting me for pointing it out. Who's paying you?
@_date: 2014-08-13 15:28:48
Then wikipedia would have EVEN MORE money they basically don't actually need at all.

you can buy any amount but you have to deal with absurd numbers like 0.00001213252534 or whatever
furthermore despite the hype you've probably heard it's not anonymous (tho kind of can be used anonymously in some specific circumstances), is not instant to send, and does have fees.

It doesn't surprise me, anyone who newly visits the sub (or pretends to be new) can easily see that if you post a 'WOW THIS IS COOL HOW DO I GET STARTED BITCOIN" thread you get showered with tips.

yet again i can't tell standard bitcoin seriousposting from truely genius, subtle, complex trolling. badly/well done good sir

So Dorian really IS Satoshi!
@_date: 2014-01-28 13:27:40
Sorry I don't agree. By that logic if I buy something from amazon with my credit card I bought it with credit and not dollars. However, anyone will agree that the actual currency both amazon and myself are using is dollars and not 'credit'.
To me it seems more like 'arguing over semantics' to say that Overstock accepted Bitcoin if they in fact didn't receive a single satoshi.
@_date: 2014-09-23 14:29:51
But while there's moonlight and music and love and romance,
@_date: 2014-09-23 14:07:50
and for it to be legal, and for it to be a remotely feasible let alone good idea...
@_date: 2014-10-02 15:32:16
whaaaat there's an app for nagging merchants into accepting bitcoin now!?
@_date: 2014-09-01 23:23:41
The point is for to be able to post like 20 threads about x company "accepting bitcoin" and then the next week onwards nobody buys anything from them with bitcoin again
@_date: 2014-06-28 22:56:06
MAY ACTUALLY BE LEGITIMATE. haha NO
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:12:43
• The last bitcoin app still available on the apple store got banned for flagrantly breaking the TOC 
• Bitcoiners went off the deep end with paranoid rants and apple boycotts
• Guy promised new Nexus phones to anyone smashing their iphone on camera, sadly turned out to not be a piece of next-level trolling. :(

yeah that would do it
@_date: 2014-09-23 09:25:39
sounds so efficient, stores will surely welcome a steady trickle of neckbeards and internet drug dealers tying up the cashiers' time with awkward chat about bitcoin then getting mugged outside the door, much easier than just writing into the business the modest and simple cost of getting money securely taken to the bank by a professional insured company
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:42:33

I bought low and sold high and still hodl some and am not mad at anyone and am not paid by MasterCard so what possible explanation could there be?!? Maybe it's just that Bitcoin isn't the second coming, and this particular subreddit has become filled with people with risible options who other people with a little time to kill on the internet find amusement from winding up?
@_date: 2014-05-06 01:11:08

@_date: 2014-08-21 11:10:38
Some goldbug site making an empty distant promise as a sales gimmick to entice bitcoiners is hardly "economic terrorism"

Not only do you not need to but you pretty much can't at this point. 
At best you could do it as a money-losing hobby, and a small help to the overall system, if you get seriously into the technical side of it.

Exactly, he's a Bitcoin holder who wants to pump the value and he's in the position to make it a news event that someone's selling a luxury villa for Bitcoin, adding to the impression that this sort of sale actually happens.
@_date: 2014-12-24 10:16:53


That doesn't contradict the OP's point at all tho does it? AOL were spamming the Internet to people in order to get them to sign up to AOL and make money for AOL. Overzealous Bitcoin evangelists are spamming Bitcoin to get more people to buy Bitcoin and thus pump the price. In both cases it's spammy and annoying to a lot of people and is a different approach to normal honest word of mouth about the technology

AKA like what, 2% of the number of transactions the bitcoin network would have to handle to get anything like mainstream acceptance for payments?
(total out of the air rhetorical number I fully admit haha, feel free to give me a real figure for more successful sarcasm in future)
@_date: 2014-02-05 15:13:42
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:51:14
I wasn't wrong tho so
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:28:06
OK yes you're right better just pump some rounds into that thing and have done with it
@_date: 2014-01-03 11:44:40

Apple removing some app that breaks their TOS from the app store as they have done with many other bitcoin and non-bitcoin apps in the past without this much drama occurring is one of the LEAST political bitcoin-related events of recent times.

But those are all examples of things that work perfectly well already and there's no reason to make less efficient by requiring everyone to use their phone to do them.
Why would every drink token at a festival need the security overkill of being a coloured coin? You get as many plastic tokens as you need, you sell them, people hand then over the bar. There's no double spend issue, there's nobody counterfeiting them in a field :D And people at a festival living in tents for 3 days are liable to not be able to charge their mobile devices, have lost them, be too wrecked to use them etc etc. introducing coloured coins into this scenario has no benefit to anyone.

Even if they were super successful people would still find it funny and would use it to mock them, it's just not a very professional way to come up with a business name/domain name. I accept tho that the whole operation it was probably started in an organic and non-marketing-driven way and they didn't really know how things would turn out. 
Anyway it will never stop being amusing and absurd, and it will never inspire confidence in bitcoin. It simply wasn't a good idea.

@_date: 2014-10-26 19:30:05
I think you've misunderstood: if two options are available, Bitcoin and credit card, people who want to do chargebacks can and will still use credit cards. A few or even a lot of honest customers switching to Bitcoin makes zero difference to the number of chargebacks.

The reason for getting paid monthly is not that it's too hard to send people money every day in terms of transferring it from one account to, another but because companies don't want to do it for many reasons including the cost of accounting/payroll admin, the need for a cashflow, tax, employment laws, etc.

Guys there aren't enough threads handwringing over what to call bits or whatever, could you all post some more please? We need to sort this out because people are really ever going to actually be pricing things in bitcoin and not the current value of it in usd
@_date: 2014-04-17 10:10:52
No you don't understand, all bitcoin problems are instantly 'solved' by knowing that they could happen but claiming that, because they would be a bad thing for bitcoin, nobody would ever do them. 
has a meltdown every time someone suggests using a different unicode B as the bitcoin symbol on forums. Actually making important innovations and improvements to bitcoin is RIGHT out.

Of all the "killer app" ideas that are springing up this week for some reason, I think this is the most feasible simply because I don't understand it in the slightest and therefore it must be some hardcore computer nerd stuff which bitcoin might actually even be useful for and not useless and/or illegal like all the other 'killer apps' i've been reading about :D

To be fair international tranfers is a different matter (but, evil as it is, paypal has always done the job for me buying things online around the world without what i'd consider excessive charges) and I was mostly being sarcastic/trolling... but here in the UK I can transfer money to anyone else's bank account with no charge, EVERYWHERE accepts debit cards and they can be used much easier than any in-person implimentation of bitcoin payment I've heard about, online banking with near-instant transfers and full access to statements etc is near-universal, and I've just never run into a consumer-side situation where i've thought "you know what, bitcoin would really make this so much easier"

@_date: 2014-09-23 15:32:11
I know bitcoin is all about having Schrödinger's wealth which exists so long as you only HODL and never use it but what would be the point of having a credit card if you never give the credit card details to anyone? It's not the world's best system but it works.
and credit is not the wisest financial move I admit but then again neither is 'investing' in bitcoin for many people
Plus i don't actually have a credit card :D

A little bit of additional business (assuming it's even additional at all and not just people who would have previously paid by CC using bitcoin instead for the 5% discount) does not make less fraud (ie "avoid charge-backs, fraud") happen. 
You have a slight point in that of course if they earn more money overall (and history has shown that's a BIG 'if' when it comes to people actually buying much with bitcoin, vs saying they would while nagging companies to accept it) then the percentage of legit to fraudulent business improves on paper, but earning more money is not at all the same thing as "avoiding fraud". It doesn't stop them losing the money they lose, and anyway the whole premise of this thread is the notion that they can afford a 5% discount because they are losing *less* money on fraud
How on earth does that add up or benefit the merchant in any way? If they're paying 5% for fraud prevention and losses why not just live with that rather than also paying 5% for people to use bitcoin? If 30% of their customers change to bitcoin how does that affect the &lt;1% who commit credit card fraud?

Don't forget the followup steps once they do decide to accept it:
2. don't ever buy anything with bitcoin there ever
3. start a whining reddit thread about it when they stop accepting bitcoin because nobody paid using it and yet still have the logo sticker on their window

Yes but we're not actually tying to help poor people here but rather to pump Bitcoin, so it works too (or maybe even better) if they are relatively rich
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:40:45
yeah ok bitcoin is better because you can bribe people into saying it's 'easy' ?
@_date: 2014-03-02 15:57:52
Over here we now have a contactless system where for small purchases (coffee places etc) you have to do almost literally nothing to pay, just wave your card at the thing.
If using a fast and easy phone payment system really is a killer app for a lot of people then I personally feel like it's more likely the banks will start offering such services than people will turn to bitcoin en masse.
Anyway I get the point, I just don't see that much consumer benefit to spending bitcoin, even aside from the fact that most bitcoin folks seem to be more about hanging on to it for the hypothetical day when it's worth millions of $ rather than any kind of spending at all.

Weird that, if is to be believed, the two most important things about bitcoin are:
1. No chargebacks!
2. Making a big show of "giving" people a tiny amount of money but being sure to be able to stingily claw it back if they don't consider hours of their time trying to figure out nerdy computer stuff worth a few cents of some Internet currency they don't understand

Not really, the banking/traditional transaction just moves from being between business and customer to being between business and bitcoin payment business. 
Plus also the customer most likely bought the bitcoin at some point so that's an addition banking to bitcoin exchange transaction. So bitcoin has doubled the business for the bank/CC.

I'll give my credit card info to any imaginable number of companies because that's the *entire reason for having the thing*!! and the minor risk of the minor inconvenience of having to cancel the card and get some fraudulent payments reversed/refunded by my bank (which has touch wood never happened to me anyway) outweighs the convenience of being able to buy stuff online, even with money I don't actually have :D
Certainly a more secure and faster or easier payment method would be nice, bitcoin isn't it.

taking actual bitcoin as a currency doesn't necessarily mean 'hoarding' them and is more like what would actually happen if it were to become anything like a real currency. Businesses would accept bitcoin, save some and spend some

Sorry, I don't understand your reply.
I'm asking how merchants could save any money on chargebacks unless they *only* accepted bitcoin. Why would the sort of people who make chargebacks (ie scammers or unreasonable/dishonest 'normal' customers) choose to use a payment method which doesn't allow them to make chargebacks?

Yeah, all that, serious as it is for bitcoin and the people involved with it obviously, is a drop in the ocean in terms of disruption to the economy overall.
Furthermore the thread title's implication is that banning it would be MORE disruptive than allowing it, which doesn't make much sense around here since most bitcoin believers think it's going to revolutionise the world and replace the USD or whateverr...

Sarcasm/arguing aside, my point was just that 'accepting bitcoin' is not much of a metric of freedom of a country on it's own. I wasn't really trying to get into specifics but tho what you quoted is of course an improvement on their recent history it's still much less 'free' re:LGBT rights than many countries who only accept filthy fiat for their taxes.
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:06:45
so why did you even post it if there's no connection to bitcoin? Congrats on buying a big silver horse coin I guess. Should everyone now start threads about the supposed value in bitcoin of arbitrary objects purchased with dollars?

It's because of an astroturfing and brigading campaign from this sub.

@_date: 2014-06-18 15:16:16
most likely the usual happened, ie this sub leading a campaign of hype and astroturfing to convince them that they'd get more custom if they accepted bitcoin, followed by near-zero bitcoin business for them as soon as the hype threads drifted off the front page.

I'm absolutely not some dogecoin True Believer or part of any campaign, i'm just finding the whole thing an amusing diversion at the moment. I'm somewhat interested in bitcoin and own a bit of one, but these days I'm pretty sceptical of the whole thing and find very very large sections of the fanbase and their actions utterly risible.
I'm not very serious about reddit in general either so maybe i upvote things more frivolously than some. :3

yeah a small flat plastic object with which you touch a thing with and maybe type 4 digits is SO much more complicated than typing 4 digits to unlock your phone (hope you weren't away from a charger for too long!),  open an app, point camera at a QR code, hope it scans, wait for confirmation if it's anything actually expensive you're buying...
anyway this is hypothetical because almost nowhere irl accepts bitcoin so you have to have the TERRIBLE DOUBLE INCONVENIENCE  of carrying your phone AND a small flat piece of plastic for the forseeable future :(

It's really weird, they seems to have kept bumbling on under the radar, likewise I was suprised there was no big reveal/cut and run but then again they did get and presumably spend a tonne of research money and they still seem to have some true believers. Also they subsequently came out with some non-overunity water heater thing...

Maybe the problem is that most of the 'good news' isn't actually good. eg 'X BIG COMPANY ACCEPT BITCOINS!' actually means that more people effectively cash out bitcoins to USD via coinbase/bitpay payment and that of course doesn't help the price however much awareness of bitcoin is raised

Because people have been using it despite the ongoing various terrible things they did/didn't do for years, and above all because they had an unnaturally inflated value for bitcoin so everyone could feel like they were even more of a millionaire and TO THE MOON! so that became the official value of bitcoin even tho it was absurdly higher than average.

Probably, but they are apparently problems that nobody needs or wants to overcome.  In any case they aren't inherently solved by bitcoin, and they definitely won't be solved just in order to pay people in bitcoin by the day.
Plus I doubt workers will be exactly clamouring for their employers to have the ability to easily pay them by the second instead of a daily wage :D

small corner stores having a minimum on cards because it's unprofitable or inconvenient to take them for small amounts is nothing to do with the age of the technology and will still happen with new payment methods such as bitcoin if the fees and the sales technology surrounding the payment method also make it unprofitable or inconvenient.

1. In the checkout, it showed they accepted PayPal. Awesome.
2. I googled "promo codes" for the website, and found there was a 40% discount today. Double awesome.
3. I paid with US dollars using paypal in 15 seconds. (Sweet, but nothing new there.)
4. When the transaction was done, I didn't need to "buy back" anything because i was just buying a thing with money. Triple awesome.

Or just dropped entirely, there's nothing about changetip which inherently requires Bitcoin, they could hypothetically operate the exact same service but with tipping accounts charged and withdrawn via PayPal or card instead of Bitcoin

QR codes work fine and it makes sense at the moment to use them for bitcoin stuff in many cases but it's so weird that people on here insist that it's 'faster' than other forms of payment when it's really just obviously not.

A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, known atheist
 ”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!”
 At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.
 ”How old is this rock, pinhead?”
 The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied “4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian”
 ”Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now”
 The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the “poor” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!
 The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.
 The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.
 Semper Fi.

@_date: 2014-10-27 00:07:51
I can already get 10% or more off all sorts of things I might want to buy at any number of online or IRL stores, and that's not necessarily incentive for me to actually shop there with the convenient payment methods i already use, let alone try some confusing new one. And if I do buy them from those stores I have consumer protection, it'd have to be a pretty unique and special product for me to risk getting ripped off for the sake of saving a few percent. 
I think just don't think it's that spectacular a reason for people to try bitcoin. plus as others have pointed out, 10% is simply not sustainable as an ongoing thing rather than a one-off sale.

Nice that they can afford to make 3 days loss at one store for a good publicity stunt (assuming they're even really going 'bitcoin only' which i guess is just hype/bad journalism). Might work out well for them and bitcoin I guess probably but it's purely a gimmick in my opinion.

Deceiving the customer is good for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-02-18 16:09:05
No, the point is not that he's 'holding' it, it's that he's ACTUALLY accepting bitcoin as currency, as opposed to using coinbase or whatever in order to be able to 'accept bitcoin' as a publicity stunt while receiving USD not bitcoin himself. That's clearly good for it as a currency.
