How does one take a part of a decentralized anonymous untrackable cryptocurrency 'public'? Can't access the article currently, it sounds ridiculous...

So at 5k is it time to buy in? What do you guys think? 
This is following the same pattern as each record high in previous years no? This is the crash and low that will remain for a long while before the next boom

that's super fascinating. no successors to his fortune even?

That's the funny thing too. I'm thinking, well, if I am feeling like buying soon, as someone not eager to jump in without careful consideration, then I have to wonder if the FOMO that is creeping up on me is happening to others. And if that's the case it will go up soon.
But the FOMO isn't too strong yet. I'm thinking 3k is where it will be unBEARable (i'll see myself out)

I also don't understand the core concept of "buying Bitcoin". Who am I buying it from exactly?
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:45:25
Doesn't none of any of this shit matter? 
If more people buy into BTC, price will go up, and mining activity will go up because it's more profitable. That's it. There's nothing to glean from this

Fucking lol

Now this is a speculative graph I can get behind
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:16:26
I think if price is too low to profit, then no mining will happen, ...but doesn't that mean hashes aren't being solved, so transactions aren't being completed/verified/whatever on the block chain?
Must be wrong because that sounds like a system failure

thank you, I really didn't know about the dynamic difficulty adjustment. good to know!

Funny I asked if I should buy when it was at $5k, that was a few days ago? Oof

Regardless of the accuracy in the minutia of this graphic, the main point holds pretty true, in that we are some time away from another big rise but that historically it is likely that it will come in about the same increasing ratios as before no?
I'll probably buy in soon

@_date: 2017-06-20 19:35:24
most contracts IIRC now specifically say 'if any one part of this contract is breached, it does not in any way void or alter any other term within the contract' or something to that effect.
which makes sense, especially if you've done complicated projects with details included in the contract, this is just a more realistic agreement. and you still have every legal right you would normally to any part of the contract that is breached.
