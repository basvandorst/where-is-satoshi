Could you ELI4?
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:27:20
How about that in an ELI3 format?
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:08:13
But what do peeledMLGbananas have to do with my apple booth. ELI2 por favor.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:21:42
Honestly, it is very simple math. And I suck at math.  
  
You buy an apple for a dollar. You wait a week and now all apples on earth can be sold for 2$. Your apple is now worth 2$. The price has doubled. It has increased 100%. If the price goes from 5000$ to 10000$ and you had initially bought 2500$ of btc, it would be the equivalent of having purchased half of a 1$ apple for 50cents and now the half apple is worth twice as much as it used to. So it's now a buck.

To answer your question:  
  
"What happens to my 500.00USD if BTC increases in value"  
  
Nothing. You do not have 500.00USD. As soon as you exchanged it for Bitcoin, all you have is the Bitcoin. And if Bitcoin goes up 100% then your Bitcoin (being Bitcoin itself) goes up 100%.   
  
If you trade your banana for an apple. You no longer have a banana. If the value of an apple goes up, your apples' value goes up.  
  
I'm no med student, but I'm a Bioanthropology major and know a fair bit about biology and feel pretty confident in saying that fairly recent and specific Alzheimer phenomena does not share a difficulty level with exchange and value mathematics.

Well he did use the word "when" which he then followed with "do I have to pay taxes".
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:34:19


   
Let's not kid ourselves guys. We have an objective where Bitcoin will serve as a currency, but as of right now we are still in an adoption phase where Bitcoin exists much more prevalently as a commodity.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:36:12
You literally asked people what would happen if something you bought became worth more. Now for some reason you compare the complexity of that kind of subject matter to Amyloid plaques in Alzheimer patients.   
  
The understanding of Amyloid plaques in Alzheimer patients is conditional to the understanding of university level medical and biological subject matter.  
  
The understanding of how an item, once subject to a raise in value, can be sold for a higher cost and create wealth proportionally based on how much you own, is not conditional to the understanding of any university level mathematics or economics program. It is logically in line with what we used to do in the schoolyard with trading cards.   
  
I understand that you asked a basic question and got laughed at for it. I understand that you take pride in what you know and are proud of your achievements as a pre-med student. Kudos. But just take the hit, admit you asked a fairly dumb question that we all know you could have solved had you taken a minute to think it through. Don't get rilled up about it, you might start developing some of those amyloid plaques there.

Why don't you just pay your damn taxes?

 Probably not really talking about shorting but more so about just selling high and buying back low. Unless they have a friend who is loaning them BTC.

I'm no investment specialist but IMO it depends on your disposable income when talking about such a volatile investment.  
  
If you are looking for the best long term reward and have a fair amount of disposable income. Wait for a dip then invest as a lump sum. If you have a small amount of disposable income or a very variable amount of disposable income, are less inclined to follow the charts and are not worried about risk, go for constant periodic purchases. If you have a small amount of disposable income or a very variable amount of disposable income, are willing to follow the graphs closely and/or want to manage risk, go for periodic lump investments during dips.  
  
I go for the lump sum investment and are hodling for the long term. I have yet to find a way to buy small amounts of BTC without getting embarrassed by the fees. That being said I know other on here can help you out if you opt for the constant periodic investment of smaller amounts.

Wish I could help, but there are much more tech savy people on here than I.   
  
Good luck ;)

Let's say you buy 2 LTC  each (142$) and the value of LTC doubles in value over X period. You now have 2 LTC valued at 284$. 
If you spend your initial 142$ on Bitcoin at 4500$ (0.03155BTC) and the price of Bitcoin doubles you still have 284$. 
Now seeing as nothing obliges you to buy whole BTC or whole LTC in that you can buy decimal values, nothing really changes and it all depends on which coin you see taking on more value AND/OR being of more use as a currency in the future.
That being said, one could gamble on LTC following suit with BTC and hitting 1000x values in only a few years, in which case you are damn right and LTC is the way to go. The thing is, no one knows or can know if LTC, ETH, BCC/BCH will follow in BTC's steps. So it's a bit of a gamble there.

Trump could be the best thing to ever happen to Bitcoin just as much as he could be the absolute worst.  
  
Let's just hope he stays out of it so we don't need to find out, cause chances are he's pretty high on fiat currency seeing as he owns a ton of the stuff

@_date: 2017-09-08 03:31:42
That's a tough one to answer. It's all speculative for sure. Wait for "bad news" that doesn't really affect bitcoin but can be perceived as bad for bitcoin, wait for the dip and invest during the dip. Otherwise it's being aware of what kind of run we are in and trying to take a shot at the sweet spot before it rises back up.

Are people really buying gold with their cryptocurrency returns? I'd imagine with the way things are going they are buying more crypto.

Read the Bitcoin white paper for a fairly detailed look at the objectives and concept behind Btc
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:48:59
I would not feel comfortable taking out a loan or using a line of credit to invest in bitcoin. Use your disposable income ($2000) and add in your additional saved up $1500s all while making sure you look at diversification options. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:58:09
Yeah, I can throw out a percentage or whatnot but I can guarantee that a lot of people who invest in crypto are investing in more than just BTC. That being said BTC is most likely their main investment at around 70-80%, with the other 20% being ETH, BCC/BCH, LTC or some other altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:53:00
Just want to remind you that you are taking a massive risk in trusting some person on the internet with 400$ worth of BTC. I'd at least try to work in a split payment type of thing where you send maybe 50% of the BTC and receive 50% of the payment before going ahead with the other 50%. 
Up to you though. Good luck getting to a safe spot this week.

I'll speak for Canada here, but I'm confident it applies elsewhere.  
  
One of the biggest things Bitcoin needs is for it to be viewed as a legitimate option by a vast majority of people. Now although we here on Reddit very much appreciate the decentralized benefits of Bitcoin and some of us seem to also really like it as some form of anti-establishment tool, this is not a sentiment that will garner much credibility in the eyes of the vast majority of the population. The Canadian pirate party is viewed as a joke on the Canadian political spectrum, it represents a message but offers itself as a very poor champion in the fight for popularity. Don't get me wrong, Bitcoin being supported by the Canadian Pirate party is a good thing, but I wouldn't go brandishing signs about how people should buy into Bitcoin with a CPP logo on it.

@_date: 2017-09-09 03:22:05
Yeah. And with 100$ I'd go full in with Bitcoin. The altcoins are really following Bitcoin's trend right now and none of them seem poised to really shoot up like Bitcoin did. 
Either way, whichever path you chose, best of luck to ya! ;)

This. It's climbing like nuts right now, but a dip is inevitable. If you're going long term, who cares, buy it now and hold. If you really want to get the best buck for btc value, wait for the expected dip. That being said, if the crazy best scenario does happen and there is no dip, you will miss out if you wait.
@_date: 2017-09-07 05:52:20
I would not recommend investing 100% of your 40k into BTC. Investment professionals disagree all the time in regards to what type of investment is the best investment, but they are nearly unanimous in promoting the diversification of assets. For cryptocurrency that can mean going after altcoins, but in the overall scheme of investment, exploring investment opportunities outside of cryptocurrency is not a bad idea. That being said the choice (and risk) is yours.  
  
As for getting paid in BTC, for individuals there are many websites where people do contractual work in exchange for bitcoin. For businesses there are platforms that can be useful, though I wouldn't want to pretend to know how applicable in regards to the financial accountability of a business.
