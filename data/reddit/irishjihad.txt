I wouldn't have minded if they had notified me.  But a  week and a half of "pending", and only a form letter response when I contact them is not good financial business practice.  If they don't want my money, fine, but let me know so I'm not tying up money for no reason.

Will do.

If you read it, you'd know that I already did.  Quit fucking commenting without reading . . .

Trying to start out with Bitcoins is certainly not "instant", and there are fees everywhere unless you're willing to meet a stranger with a large amount of cash.  And unless you're tech-savvy and borderline paranoid, your money can be stolen while you're sitting in your living room, and you have very, very little recourse when that happens.

If it is more than a week, contact them.  I've had two transactions canceled, and the only way I found out was by emailing them.  Even though they had taken the money out of my bank account.  And even though I have verified all possible information about myself.  The first was never resolved, and I'm still waiting to hear about the second.  
Unless they really hop on things for you, you're probably SOL.

From their FAQ: "When you buy or sell bitcoin, you receive the price listed the moment you click either Buy or Sell.
If we've reached our daily limit for purchases, sometimes you will be notified that this is different than usual. You can read more about purchasing after we've reached our daily limit here."  
And "When we’ve reached our daily limits, for purchases there is an option to execute it at a “future market price”—with this option, you will receive your bitcoin at the price that exists at payout, approximately four business days from clicking Buy. If you’re unsure which purchase you made, you can look up the transaction on the Buy/Sell page under the History tab—you will see either a concrete number of bitcoin, meaning that is the fixed amount you will receive, or the message "You purchased bitcoin at the market rate," meaning the amount you receive will vary based on the market rate that exists at the moment of payout."
By their own supposed rules, either they should have given him the price noted when he "clicked", or they should have notified him.  They appear to have done neither.  I would say that is bad business practice at best.

Why Peercoin versus Litecoin or any of the others?

And this is where user adoption will have issues.  I researched it for too long (from $35 or so to $210), and still have a shaky handle on what the hell I'm doing.

Both of my emails have been polite and professional.  The two responses I've gotten so far had no details.  As I said, I'll try to work it out, but for a tech-based company I'd expect at least an automatic notice when an order is canceled. At least then I wouldn't have had money tied up for no reason.

Compared to my experience with starting Bitstamp and Coinbase accounts, starting a Fidelity account was a breeze, and MUCH faster.  I have a solid financial record, but had issues with both of the Bitcoin companies.  I don't have a problem with IDing myself, but if I have issues getting "verified" then the average Joe is going to have a brick wall in front of him.  Yes, anecdotal information is anecdotal, but given how many of us had issues with Coinbase in the last month, I am hardly alone.

If the argument FOR bitcoin is that it is the future, you need to accept that the vast majority of people are not tech savvy.  And, by definition' 50% of people are of below average intelligence.  I would bet that well over 80% of Americans has never heard the words Ubuntu or Linux.  Most home computers I've dealt with for friends, family, etc., are so laden with malware that they operate at a small fraction of their potential.
