Short term trends have little meaning in Economics.
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:43:44
That's an incorrect way of looking at it.
The idea is whether 1 BTC today is worth more or less than 1 BTC tomorrow, not whether you want to buy 1 BTC today or 1 BTC tomorrow.
Your final statement is true, but it misses the point.

Gox is seen by many (read: the media) as the central exchange. To people that don't know a whole lot about bitcoin, trouble with Gox means trouble with the entire system. Whether you agree with it or not, this is how many bitcoin users see it, and this is why the price is plummeting.

This is an incredibly simplified conclusion that frankly doesn't work in the real world.
The Fed doesn't simply print money like you insinuate that they do. The reason the Fed prints money is simply supply and demand; they need to keep interest rates above inflation in order to keep the value of the dollar. If interest rates get too low, the Fed actually BUYS money back from the system. The money supply does not constantly expand, in fact it is often cut down to keep the value of the dollar steady.
Your example is more along the lines of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe kept printing money, and that's why they are experiencing hyperinflation.

I believe that if bitcoin is to establish itself as a true currency, it needs to be regulated in some fashion. Unregulated economies are too easy to game, and way too easy to fall into traps similar to those of the Great Depression. 
Although to be fair, I have no idea who those regulators could possibly be.

Depends a lot on how you convert it, but that is a viable point.
@_date: 2013-05-11 16:08:14
Exactly my point. Many people (especially people who like to post about it) know nothing about how the Fed actually works, and therefore it isn't a factor in their decision making.
@_date: 2013-05-19 15:41:06
Being 100% honest here, (which may make me seem like a bit of a dick) but frankly that is not how either the Fed or economics works.

I'm very familiar with bitcoin, I want to discuss the merits of it as a currency rather than a commodity. I find the market fun and fascinating. I constantly hear people saying bitcoin will replace the dollar, and quite frankly I just want to hear their reasoning.
Long story short, I'm an Econ student looking for some differing opinions on bitcoin's validity as a currency for your average person
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:06:15
All of that is very true, which is one of my reservations about bitcoin. I very much believe that the bubble will raise the value high above the actual worth, which will cause the prices to plummet.
It's a dangerous situation for the early adapters.
@_date: 2013-05-10 23:41:01
I see that as bitcoin's goal, but is that really how it works at the moment?
I feel like many of the new vendors accepting bitcoin are doing so through what is essentially a conversion service, so when you look at it from outside the box that sort of complicates the process. Why not just use dollars instead of converting to bitcoin and converting back?
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:44:00
You can't base long term success off of short term success, that's all there is to it. Nobody knows what is going to happen for the next few years, there should be no speaking in absolutes.

Comparing anything to gasoline or housing is, quite frankly, foolish.  Land constantly increases in value, it has absolutely nothing to do with the value of the dollar. Housing is always in high demand.
Likewise, gasoline is an entirely different animal and I could talk about that market for hours. The gasoline market is incredibly complex, and varies wildly from country to country.  Gasoline is getting more expensive, that doesn't mean the dollar is getting weaker.
In fact, that's the fault in your argument. Price levels rise. That's just a law of the economy. I can't buy the same bundle of goods today for the same price as it was 20 years ago. That's going to happen, whether I'm paying for it with dollars, bitcoins, shells, euros, gold, or paintings of Kevin Costner. 
When I said there is a lot of stability in purchasing power, I meant among global currencies. You don't see yen losing or gaining 50% of its value in one day. 
Finally, I agree with you about Bitcoin stabilizing. It will stabilize eventually. However, I do not believe that stabilization will last. Bitcoin, besides the idea that it is scarce, really has nothing behind it. (I'll preemptively defend the idea that the dollar has nothing behind it, it has the backing of the US Government which is a conversation for another day.) Back to the Great Depression example, a major cause of it was stock prices rising to points much, much higher than they were worth. When people finally realized that, they crashed and a whole lot of people got a whole lot poorer. The government (once again, I'm not saying the US Gov't should be the ones to regulate this) stepped in, and put regulations on stocks to make sure this didn't happen again. That is what I believe needs to happen, before there is a market crash and the bitcoin is rendered worthless.

This article jumps to conclusions, but it raises an important point. A person isn't necessarily "stupid" because they don't understand internet security.
A common argument is "well so-and-so should have known that they needed to...". That's the problem, they don't. If bitcoin is going to have widespread adoption, this needs to be simplified so that the average person can easily protect their money. Most people that have bitcoin now claim that it's easy, but keep in mind most early adopters are more computer-savvy than your average person.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:37:50
The fear is that exponential growth is usually unsustainable. Bitcoins have a value, but it is already likely that their real value has been exceeded by speculation
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:16:12
I don't quite see how bitcoin is a "threat" to the Fed, this seems to be really common rhetoric around here but it doesn't really make sense. If you use American Money to buy bitcoins, it doesn't just disappear, it goes to whoever you bought it from. That person then goes on to consume goods using that money, or saving it. Bitcoin is no more a threat than anything else you would buy, it is simply a currency that can be accepted widely
@_date: 2013-08-14 16:59:23
A hit to the US bitcoin market would be a hit to the global bitcoin market. A shutdown of the US bitcoin market would do very serious damage to the global market

This is a poor comparison though; if someone robs my local bank, I don't actually lose any money.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:53:29
That is assuming that bitcoin becomes THE universal currency. While it has a lot of potential, I simply don't see that occurring. 
I realize that many people here are classical economists in that they want as little regulation as possible, but for something to become global there needs to be control. As seen in the Great Depression, an economy left to its own devices will spiral out of control. Bitcoin, in its current form, seeks to be totally unregulated, which is not sustainable
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:33:09
I'm happy to see something like this posted, because it isn't a joke. As an Econ student fascinated by the bitcoin market, I see many parallels between this market and that of the months leading into the Great Depression. There were barely any controls on stocks then, so everyone just kept buying until the value of the stocks was so overinflated that they meant nothing. There were a series of crashes, then the prices rose again, and then there was the final crash. Bitcoin is an incredibly risky investment. 
I see a lot of the same optimism here that was felt during the 20's, and I am nervous that it will meet with a similar outcome.
@_date: 2013-05-11 16:09:55
Makes sense. Do you see it as becoming THE singular form of payment in the future, as many in this sub do?

Are there fees associated with converting USD to bitcoin through services like MTGox?
As for the second, Paypal serves a similar, more widely accepted function. Why bitcoin over Paypal?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:15:09
While this is a valid point, bitcoin cannot even be considered to be on the scale of world currency at the moment. There is no insurance with bitcoin, it isn't a national currency (and will never be, based on its decentralized demeanor), and it has barely been adopted as a currency. I do believe bitcoin can become a currency powerhouse, but not in the state it is in today, and not the way it is being used today, as an investment, not a currency.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:59:11
Currently, bitcoin is deflating though, which is encouraging saving. Eventually, bitcoin is going to outpace its actual value, if it hasn't done that already. That will lead to a massive bubble burst, which could be likened to the stock market crashing during the Great Depression.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:48:54
Some inflation is necessary for economic growth though, so while that may sound like a drain it is a necessary evil.
@_date: 2013-04-17 05:19:46
His main argument seems to be that it can't be considered a bubble simply because bitcoin isn't a large enough part of the market. However, it's obvious that within the bitcoin market itself, there was a rapid loss of wealth. 
His secondary argument is whether the bitcoin exceeded its intrinsic value enough to be considered a bubble. While I would argue that it had, only time will tell. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:15:20
Inflation occurs when an economy is growing. That's as simple as I can explain it to you. If there is no inflation, then the economy cannot grow. Many people believe inflation is a bad thing; in moderation it is extremely healthy.
As for what regulations can be put into place, I cannot say specifically because it would very much depend on who is doing it. I would like to see bitcoin be backed by a moderately sized nation (economically speaking). From there, some trade restrictions would likely occur, similar to those of other recognized currencies
@_date: 2013-05-11 04:03:50
Specifically mentioned don't discuss the Fed, because that's a whole different can of worms. Every argument comes down to whether the Fed should be involved or not, and that is simply a fundamental disagreement. Every time I start a discussion on this subreddit this comes up, and it won't go anywhere. It's a fundamental difference between classical and Keynesian economics.
@_date: 2013-05-04 01:01:56
From a scholastic viewpoint, bitcoin is a hotbed for study. I intend to begin research in the fall with one of my professors on it.
From a personal viewpoint, I would like to see bitcoin succeed. I just do not believe it can both succeed and thrive in the state it is in today
@_date: 2013-05-11 00:50:58
That has to do with bitcoin's infancy though, prices will rise and fall a lot before they finally  stabilize. If they don't stabilize, bitcoin will never be an attractive currency. The current fluctuation makes it more interesting (if not attractive) as a commodity, but bitcoin intends to be a currency
@_date: 2013-05-02 13:41:41
I wasn't taught, I researched. I am an Econ major, I have come to my own conclusions.
I should have been more clear, I never said there should be no inflation, just that it needs to be somewhat manageable.
As for the rest of your argument, comparing the dollar to the dollar would be completely foolish, but when you look at the world economy as a whole there is generally a lot of stability in purchasing power, with notable exceptions. Those notable exceptions have become or began to become worthless because they have devalued out of control. Bitcoin needs to stabilize so it won't be looked at like those currencies

This is one of the things that is very frustrating for me in this subreddit, there is this massive "us vs. them" idea. Here we have the "True Believers" vs. the "Trolls". 
How about people like me, who love economics and see bitcoin as a test of the economic theory that I've been studying. Or people who read about bitcoin in the news and just want to understand how it works. Or people who see uses for bitcoin, but aren't convinced. Or people that don't quite believe in bitcoin, but are willing to give it thought.
If you want to be able to have any conversation in the subreddit that isn't "To the moon!", "BTC is dead", or "BTC IS THE FUTURE OF EVERYTHING", then you need to be willing to talk to people. It's incredibly easy to lump everyone who doesn't agree into the "stupid troll" category and ignore what they say, when they may actually have good points.
I enjoyed the conversations that I used to have in this subreddit a few months ago, but it's been dead to conversation for a while now. Nobody is willing to be civil because everyone that disagrees is a troll.

This is very true. Deflation is often a more terrifying situation than inflation due to its tendency to spiral out of control. It is a breeze to reign in inflation compared to deflation

I'm sick of both sides here, the "bitcoin religious" and the "haters".  Neither side has any idea what will happen, so stop shoving any change in the other side's face. 
Every time there's a spike or a dip, all polite discourse goes flying out the window. This subreddit as a whole needs to listen to both sides, as well as the moderates. This currency needs help being established, and blind faith in either direction does not help.

Honestly, this is an awful, awful representation of Keynesian economics. 
First off, the author needs to work on their tone, there's a difference between an "ironic" critique and what they are doing; this reeks of self-righteousness. This is the "YOU'RE WRONG HAHA" school of argument, and it doesn't work. You aren't going to convince anyone of anything by writing like that, the only people that will be impressed are those that already agree with you.
Besides that, wow. This is why discussing economics on the subreddit can be a nightmare. There's a reason why you can spend years getting a degree focusing on either classical or Keynesian economics; they are complicated. Anything can sound stupid when it is boiled down to nothing, like in this article.
@_date: 2013-05-02 11:45:23
No need to talk down to me. I get that the popular opinion is no regulation, but that doesn't mean there can't be civil discourse.
As I've said, I don't have all the answers, but a currency needs to be stable to be viable to the masses. Central banks do a lot of work behind the scenes of the economy to do this to our current currencies, and quite frankly, it works. Central banks are key to stopping both inflation and deflation.
While its a subject that many people think they really know a lot about, I would recommend giving a second look at information from the Great Depression. Essentially, that is what occurs to an unregulated economy.
@_date: 2013-05-11 18:31:13
This is among the more frustrating aspects of this "article". The money multiplier (and the government spending multiplier, which the author mistakenly calls the money multiplier) are simply numbers. The gov't spending multiplier is simply change in government spending divided by change in output, that's it. Denying its existence is like denying the existence of the number 5. 
A proper argument against it is that it doesn't mean anything, or that it there are other factors. Not that it "doesn't exist."
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:00:50
Whoever I traded with to get the bitcoins will just go and put those dollars back into the market though.
I'm not arguing against the evolution of currency, I do believe that eventually it will occur. I just don't believe that bitcoins will be it, or that any internet currency will become stable enough to use or do any damage to real currency in the immediate future.
