I've read a lot of articles on this particular subject, I thought this one was interesting because of the source.
@_date: 2013-07-10 19:33:34
The chart is looking toward the future.  I suggest not buying from a company that you don't like the policies of.  Sounds like you have done research.  Either wait for a company to make a working product and try to order it then, or put in a preorder now.
What's the problem?
@_date: 2013-07-08 17:12:58
A couple weeks ago people were saying this was coming, great to see it moving so fast.
@_date: 2013-06-17 18:09:26
Exactly :)  if you saw the picture on the article...

That is Inaba from BFL, talking about his equipment on the GLBSE thread.  BFLS.RIG is just the name of the security.
@_date: 2013-07-12 14:33:17
It's because of the price.  With this high of a difficulty you're making no return so the higher cost system is just throwing more money down the hole.  Lower difficulty and the higher priced machines do great.
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:08:47
Yeah that's a good point, eventually the cryptography will have to be updated to meet the demands of a new system.
Also, yes, the price will fluctuate for a bit, and typically numbers like 500 have caused the market to cap, because it looks like a good number.  The renminbi is a driving force right now.  If the Chinese market decides that 3000(CNY is at 2764 today) is a good price, that would be close enough to 500 for the fluctuation you mention to happen.

USD would sink so fast if it wasn't the world reserve currency, though.  They are able to manipulate it a lot more without effect since so many people in the world use it.

Oh interesting.  KnCMiner looks like a pretty safe bet too.
@_date: 2013-07-07 00:38:37
Right, I think they are implying that the expectation of this should have a positive effect on price.
@_date: 2013-08-03 03:44:58
lol, have fun.
Yeah they are acting strangely.  I haven't received confirmation on their link to Uniquify, but if I do I'll be more on board with it.  It's all silly marketing stuff that has been a problem, not the fundamental tech credentials.
@_date: 2013-06-18 19:08:18
I posted this not so much to show everyone here how KnCMiner is on the scene, but to show that the WSJ is paying attention to MINING EQUIPMENT??  wow!
@_date: 2013-05-25 05:46:50
I'm taking cost of machine and power into consideration.  The problem here is a lead time of January, if you could get it sooner you would be able to make it back and more.  This chart doesn't mean that none of these will make money, but that some of them may not be a better investment than just buying bitcoins if you can't get them soon.
There is a link to the spreadsheet if you want to see how everything is put together.
@_date: 2013-07-12 16:00:30
Exactly.  We need to respond to this new technology by supporting companies that are trying to keep the decentralized quality.  ASIC's naturally centralize power.
@_date: 2013-07-10 17:01:11
@_date: 2013-09-06 05:21:02
Yeah, if you were buying in the smartest way you may not notice a large group getting into the mix.  Usually large investments are broken into chunks and buys happen on the low point in each period.  There is a name for this but I can't seem to remember it atm..

@_date: 2013-11-16 17:13:10
That would be great, and I agree that it is quite possible to drop into the 300's for a few days.  My best guess, though, is by the end of the year 500 will look pretty good :)
@_date: 2013-08-06 21:41:13
Faster Gox?  great!  That should stabilize the price a little.  So this will make each transaction faster, but will it cause any slowdown in the market as a whole, as the information won't be aggregated as instantly?  Probably a small effect.  Interesting one though, as the NYSE having all it's traders hosted in house, I figured bitcoin would go that route eventually.  Maybe this will be a more robust system they can copy :P
@_date: 2013-09-06 05:22:17
Not too much really.  That's why I said good luck sign.  If you had a few in a row you could conclude that the market was stabilizing, though.
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:09:45

There could be many other factors not covered here, but the basic premise that bitcoin has the potential to become monumental, and societies reaction will elevate or chain down, seems pretty solid.

Too complicated?  Nah, there would only need to be a couple applications translated and off they go. 
Many sub economies use their own price standard at the moment.  This can be dangerous in the long term, but as far as starting up it's worked for others.

Trojan infected software on the site, they sent messages to all bitcointalk.org users with a false address.
@_date: 2013-07-12 15:07:04
Check out the table below the one you are referencing, this  shows how the BFL 500 does quite amazingly vs everything else at 40% difficulty rise.  The negative return you are seeing is mostly from the cost of the miner.  You are spending more for bigger machines, but all machines get less than 10% return with 500% difficulty rise.  This means it barely matters what the hashing power is, you are still losing the initial investment.  The higher that is the more the loss.
@_date: 2013-09-05 04:56:52
He said whole coins.  I think he was saying that at some point the value of a bitcoin will just be the value of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-07-12 16:03:07
It won't matter at 500%.  If one machine is making .00001 per day and the other is making .0000001 neither will ever add up to anything.

There isn't really anything to call scam on at this point.  They are only taking orders through escrow.  If that changes, and they don't give the information on their manufacturing facility, chip design, etc., I'll pick up a pitchfork too.  :)

I wouldn't say to keep everything tied up in bitcoin, as you say.  The sentiment here, though, seems to be common on both sides.
When something happens in the bitcoin market, regulation, price fluctuation, whatever it is..  people tend to react depending on experience.  As you stay with it longer you realize that it's much more resilient than it seems.
@_date: 2013-06-29 00:36:57
It's half as fast, for about half the price, so they are almost equal value.  Buy two Saturns and your ROI will be just a little lower than if you bought a Jupiter.

I'm notoriously bearish on bitcoin. Part of my argument comes from the fact that this is a new technology, and nothing else exists quite like it. There are altcoins, of course, but unless bitcoin drops out of existence it would be very difficult for them to gain traction. I have recommended to everyone I know to put a little in. We don't know what is going to happen, and I wouldn't want to see anyone hurt by unforeseen circumstances. Nobody knows the future. This is just my best guess based on everything I've seen. My usual advice is to put what you can in, without risking your livelihood. That goes for any investment.
At the end of the day, don't take anyone's word on it. Do the research until you feel compelled to invest.
@_date: 2013-09-12 20:05:44

Gold is fool's gold in those terms.  Currency has no need of intrinsic value.  It has to have some of these properties: rarity, divisibility, fungibility, durability, portability, not consumable
Bitcoin has more of those properties in greater quality than any currency that has existed.

We just need a good connection to download it.  Think of all the new users that could jump on at the next big wave.  My worry is that I have already known people who can't have their own copy of it.  Blockchain address works fine, but it's not the whole process that allows you to do the checks yourself.  I suppose as it grows you won't need that nearly as much though.

Alrighty then.  You're ignoring the math. 356*.00001 = .00356
$22k = 218 btc
$274 = 3.11 btc

So there are a lot of things in your article that I'd like to talk about, but gold based currency?  That's not USD, what currency do you mean?
If by "the site" you mean bitcointalk.org you must be reading the Society and Politics section, because that is moderated from the other sections.  Besides bitcointalk.org, for how great a resource is, is not bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-30 19:57:41
I think that it's a natural fit for bitcoin, not necessarily that it will happen.
"One of the big long term goals is to have bitcoin become the world reserve currency.  At the moment this prestigious position is taken by the USD.  Any currency bold enough to make such a challenge will need to have the backing of a large part of the world.  This is bitcoin’s natural place in the world, and will happen gradually and automatically.  Unless, of course, there is pushback."
This is what I said in the article, not quite, "bitcoin will become the world reserve currency".  :)
@_date: 2013-09-08 15:47:05
I thought that maybe they wrote that a couple weeks ago and were a bit late in their release.  I just checked their site, and it still says August too.  This info was released yesterday so it's a typo.  There is another spot where they say they are going to start selling on Monday the 9th of Sept.
@_date: 2013-09-06 21:00:03
True, they may be waiting.  The latest round of "invitations" to bitcoin business owners does give the impression that we are getting closer to an understanding with the regulators.

The market hasn’t caught up with the price change over the past few days.  With only 80k in bitcoin traded, this will be considered a “Volumeless Rally”.  The idea is that if there is a large amount of trading that the price sits more stably because there is more pressure from both sides holding it in place.  This is often how the price rises, though.
@_date: 2013-07-04 02:58:15
This definitely does look like a miner dump.

I must have had both versions of my table up when I did that.  The price change wasn't intentional, and had nothing to do with my point.
You started out quite reasonable, why get like this?  I'm trying to go through your numbers to see where you got everything, which table, which difficulty were you pulling numbers?  I made those tables from a fork so I don't have the original data, but this is what I'm seeing from what I have is this,
400GH	243%	165%	110%	70%	38%
5GH	        172%	108%	 63%	30%	 4%
I don't see anywhere in any table that I have or have posted that shows the percentages that you quote in the original post.  If you direct me to that data and there is something wrong with it I would love to fix it.

Bad reddit!  I certainly did not want an advertisement that has out of date pricing as my pic for this article.

Each percentage on the top of the chart is a constant rise in difficulty expressed per 2016 blocks added to the block chain.  This increase happens about every 12 days.  The percentage in the miner row is a comparison of how much you pay for the unit vs how much you would get back.

Just the next month?  There are manufacturers that haven't even gotten their machines out the door yet.  And BTW we haven't seen anything yet.  These companies have spent all their R&amp;D costs to make their chips.  Now it's basically free for them to mass produce.  You think the difficulty is just going to stop here?

I know, don't you hate it when people risk their life to bring you information that the government is spying on you and lying to your face about it?  God it's annoying, happens every few years and people just won't stop talking about it.
