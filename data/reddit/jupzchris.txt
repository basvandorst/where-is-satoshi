i was getting my lunch today at a food truck - the owner and I are friends on facebook so he seems me talk about bitcoin from time to time
His comment to me - so i heard the ceo of bitcoin killed herself. Are you going to get out of it now that the company is going out of business?

all you need is country + cell phone number and authy will send an email out with a link that will authorize the change.

So you think if you used a processor for bitcoin it would not align with your philosophical views even tho you guys posted on "the board" asking ppl to hit you up if anyone wanted to beta test the processor you guys built? 
@_date: 2013-05-21 02:24:21
Lol that is indeed backwards. Do you have skype? If so add me lets talk jupzchris
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:41:11
Why didnt you guys go with bitpay like everyone else did so you would avoid the currency fluctuations and you would never hold bitcoin.
You guys did it backwards. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:38:20
There has been a handful of sites that have and all of them said it was lackluster at best. 
IMO bitcoin is hoarded and exchanged for USD and a very VERY small fraction is looking to spend it online as their everyday currency. 
maybe once bitcoin became REALLY easy to obtain ( ie purchase a card at the store ) it could be used as a way for men to buy sites without their wifes finding out - sort of like how vanilla cards used to work.

It was Amella who posted it 
"If anyone is looking for a Bitcoin gateway, feel free to contact me via the SpookyCash contact form once we are done with beta-testing. Bitcoin is only available on non-affiliate tours right now."  for the thread bitcoins for porn joins?
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:56:19
Isnt that sort of the beauty in bitcoin? there is not an unlimited number of coins. Demand sets the value 
@_date: 2013-05-20 01:33:52
Final update: Game came with no issues.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:46:26
okay then skip the middle man and get a programmer to do what bitpay is doing? 
What is so wrong with adjusting the amount of BTC you charge based on the current value versus the USD?

I work in the adult industry. More financial side of it 
bitcoin will be more widely accepted if some sort of recurring billing can be setup. A few sites did jump on it a few months back using places like bitpay to handle the transactions but it died off again.
The largest adult webmaster board has atleast 3-4 post on the main page about bitcoin but no one really wants to pioneer it. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 19:21:41
I went with wordpress with woocommerce. Woocommerce seems really easy to setup aswell. I liked that. Waiting for bitpay to approve me now :-)
@_date: 2013-05-19 17:35:37
that is what i figured. Thanks man :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:15:01
im working with ripple directly to see what happened 
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:23:23
Two months ago they changed their policy to try to comply with government regulations and KYC laws
Any transaction on their system they need to know exactly who you are.

FUCKFUCKFUCK I WAS HAVING THIS MADE :( 
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:41:55
There is NOTHING wrong with setting your price point within a processor so that it keeps your price point in Usd - &gt; btc on an even level so you dont run the risk of undercharging or overcharge a surfer.  If anything it is wrong that you DONT do that. 
Stop reading what too much into what I said. Ive been in this business just as long as you have. Hell we even had drinks together back in the day so stop reading what too much into what I say. 
You may of been one of the first in our industry to adapt bitcoin but that does not automatically mean you are doing it 100% right or the most logical way. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:54:39
There is no secret 
it literally is just buy and hold. 
Some guys treat it is a stock and watch the charts and try to guess when the best time is to buy or watch for large sell orders or buy orders to come in to decide what to do 
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:25:53
im looking for someone who wants to sell me like $30 in coin via paypal 
ill pay fees and over market value - i just want to get my dick wet lol
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:35:47
where are you guys trading? 
Is it as simple as 
Set a buy order at X.XX ( low ) for X amount and then willing to sell X amount of your stash if it hits  XX ( high ) amount?
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:54:27
I am not mad. If anything i'm glad you guys have adopted it. I just dont see how you can really think using a middle man is a bad thing? All they do is keep your price point the same as you charge your non-bitcoin clients. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 13:34:30
Another step in the right direction for the adult industry to accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 19:22:20
Does anyone know if woocommerce you can make btc the ONLY currency and when adding new content doe it auto convert the USD price to bitcoin based on the current rate if that is my only currency?

I saw a post on here not that long ago and a guy showed a picture of a bunch of plastic cards that said bitcoin and just said coming soon. 
I assume it was a POS bitcoin credit
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:15:22
automated or push/approval?
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:56:20
Wait - i'm REALLY confused now. You guys ARE using bitpay?
