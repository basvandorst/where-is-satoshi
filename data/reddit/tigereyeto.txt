Most Bitcoin clients resend the transaction periodically until it gets confirmed. 
Miners choose the transactions to include in their blocks. Most rational miners choose the ones with the highest fees first and if they have room, they grab free ones. 
Depending on the miner's settings they MAY allocate a portion of their blocks to free transactions as a gesture of goodwill. 
So... In a transaction flood, the ones with the lowest fees will likely remain unconfirmed for a while, possibly forever until it is resent with higher fees.

Entropy seems neat.
I see you have stretch goals for adding different coins...
May I suggest a cheaper and more universal option?
As I'm sure your devs know, the only difference between Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc. addresses is the version byte.
* 00 = Bitcoin. (Address starts with a 1)
* 48 = Litecoin. (starts with an L)
* 31 = Dogecoin and DEFCOIN (starts with a D)
Since the Entropy device already interfaces like a USB storage device with a JPG/PNG on it, it would be awesome if it also had a single VERSION.TXT file that the user could open, edit and save. From then on, all generated addresses will use that version number.
This way the same Entropy device can create Bitcoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, Defcoin, and any other paper wallet by simply changing this 1 number in the textfile. Put it back to "0" for Bitcoin.
Other than that, I'm looking forward to it. Cool device!

A PRNG was used in both scenarios, yes, but they were used in different ways for different uses.
With respect to the Android bug, significant amounts of funds were lost that way. Many people sent funds to their phones after generating a wallet only to find it disappear moments later.
Others generated a brand new wallet and magically saw bitcoins already present there, so they sent them to another address offline until they could figure out what was going on.

The main media topic about the Internet was how child pornographers were using it, and how children were accessing porn, and how you can download "The Anarchist's Cookbook" with recipes for bombs/etc.
Those arguments were truthful, but only a small piece of the overall story that is the Internet. It's so much more than a few bad people using it to do bad things. It enables instant communication across the globe, access to information at any time, anywhere, it's helped businesses, it's helped people cope with disease... there are 1,000,000+ good uses of the Internet for every bad use.
Bitcoin is no different. People will highlight the few bad uses and blame the technology for the crimes committed by the criminals. It's up to us to highlight every other use case just like us geeks did in the 1990s about the Internet. It is so. much. more.

P2Pool is just-as-friendly as any pool. It has the same things:
1. Pool address. Instead of your existing pool, use any public P2Pool node's address
2. username. Type your Bitcoin address here.
3. password. Ignore this. It's not needed
4. Monitor your hashrate online at ANY node's address and view your balance in your existing Bitcoin wallet.
It's technically MORE user-friendly than existing pools because you don't need to create accounts, you don't need to add worker passwords, you don't need to configure payout thresholds, and you don't need to confirm an email address.
Just use your existing cgminer/bfgminer/whateverminer and swap out the server/username. Done.

The Internet is a decentralized network, and many people made the same arguments RE: child porn when it first became popular in the '90s.
"That guy got child porn from the Internet! It's promoting illegal behaviour!"
The fact is, both the Internet and the Bitcoin network are tools, and it's up to the user to use it appropriately and follow applicable laws. We all have the freedom to break them if we want, but we're also subject to the consequences of our actions.
Despite being able to trade child porn on the Internet, it's proven to be an extremely valuable tool for millions of other uses, and Bitcoin is used daily for many more uses than committing crimes too. People who did use the Internet to trade child porn have been caught, just like people have been caught for committing crimes with Bitcoin.

So they looked up the guy's account and confirmed the name matched the account holder. 
At my datacenter, after confirming the name they would ask for the PIN/passphrase if one was configured on the account. 
So either: the agent ignored/forgot this step and failed to follow authentication procedures...
OR the exchange had no PIN configured on the account, so the call proceeded.

I find it easiest to compare it with email. Email was difficult for people at first but now is ubiquitous.
Email is letters-over-IP. Bitcoin is money-over-IP.
Bitcoin addresses are analogous to Email addresses. You create it and give it out to everyone so they can send you bitcoin. They work like email addresses that you give out to everyone so they can send you mail.
Bitcoin private keys are analogous to Email passwords. You keep it secret and it allows you to read/send bitcoin from your bitcoin account.
You can create as many bitcoin addresses as you want - just like you can create as many email addresses as you want. The main difference being we choose the passwords for our email accounts, whereas with bitcoin the passwords/private keys are created by the system and can't be changed...you still need to keep it private like your email password.

It's similar, but different.
The Android wallet bug you're (probably?) talking about involved using a bad Java RNG to generate a bitcoin address. This lead to many people generating the same bitcoin address on many phones.
This bug involves a bad RNG when applying a signature, not when generating a key. If you can predict the unguessable number used during signing then you can use the public key to derive the original private key.

You make a valid point that we've spent a LOT of time thinking about.
It seems impossible to decentralize a certification/validation process. If you use a web-of-trust model (which is the closest we could think of when forming C4), the entire validation process is subject to a sybil attack. If existing experts certify other experts, the entire web will fall as people create infinite sock-puppet accounts to vote someone as an expert so they can bestow that privilege on anyone they choose.
This is why we built C4 as a centralized non-profit entity with a network of advisors from many different industries - technical, business, HR/recruiting, etc. We distribute the question creation/validation process across our advisors who all agree/assert the questions measure competency in the 32 topics required for certification.
At that point, a central testing service can issue and grade the exams.
If you are able to come up with a way to COMPLETELY decentralize this process, I'd love to hear it. If it works, we will gladly transition C4 to a purely decentralized model.

Addresses that start with a 3 are P2SH addresses.
Once they generated the private and public keys, they used the same private key for both networks.
Normally with single key addresses the "version byte" is different for each network, which results in Bitcoin addresses starting with a 1, Litecoin addresses with an L, etc. In this case, both Bitcoin and Litecoin P2SH addresses have the same version byte and start with a 3.
You can do this on your own too!

Think of mining as "curating the ledger". 
The blockchain stores every address and balance for every user. Once every (roughly) 10 minutes a miner adds a page to the end of the ledger book that lists all of the updates people have made to the ledger. Bob sent 5btc to sue. You sent 0.29btc to Frank. 
All of these transactions are collected by a miner and put in a new block that's added to the end of the chain. As a reward, that miner can add a special transaction at the top of the page that says "25 new Bitcoin were just created out of thin air, and they now belong to my address."
So mining is the process of adding these blocks of everyone's transactions from around the world into the global ledger, the blockchain.

Just use Electrum's TxQR system.
It's built-in.
Create an unsigned tx on your online machine and display it as a QR code.
Your offline machine scans it with its built-in webcam, you sign it, and display the signed tx as a QR code.
Your online machine scans this and then you click "broadcast"
No more risk of infectable USB media.

Unfortunately journalism USED TO BE about credibility because newspaper readers would buy the paper that they felt had the most accurate information. Newspaper companies would in turn hire the most credible authors. 
Now that news is delivered over the Internet, news/media companies earn their profit from page views and clickthroughs, not the discerning choices of their readers. This has reorganized priorities so that credibility is now well below sensationalism. 
The sad thing is, I welcomed the Internet revolution to news discovery with open arms to embrace the free flow of information. It hurts when I realize that those same desires has ruined not only the delivery mechanism of the information, but the information itself.

The blockchain was started in January 2009, so it's almost 6 years old.
It only became publicly known in the last couple of years though as the tech was too difficult for people to use until maybe 2012...and it didn't get publicity until 2013.
I wish there were easy ways to gather metrics of bitcoin adoption in America. How long since January 2009 did/will it take for 25% of americans to adopt it?

A digital signature is actually an encryption of a hash. 
If I want to sign a message I start by taking a digital hash of the message. 
When I have that hash, I encrypt the hash...but instead of using a public key to encrypt it, I instead use my private key. That means that in order to decrypt it, I will use the PUBLIC key instead. 
So to verify the digital signature on a message, I will calculate the hash of that message. I'll then compare that hash I computed with whatever i decrypt from your "encrypted" hash by using your public key. If it matches I know that the message hasn't been altered and you got the same hash when you "encrypted"(signed) it. So I know it's the same. 
TL;DR: a digital signature of a message is just the hash of that message that's been encrypted using the PRIVATE key instead of the public one.

You may want to choose a different difficulty for your shares. By default it auto-chooses a difficulty it thinks is best for you, but you can override this by adding an underscore after your address.
Try 1abcyouraddress_64 or 1abcyouraddress_32 or 1abcyouraddress_128.
The most efficient option all depends on the hashrate of your miner.

That's exactly it, but moreso.
Each 'small pool in itself' is just one piece of the entire overall pool. You can hop between 100 nodes putting in 1min of mining at each and the overall payout will be equivalent to a single payout for 100min of hashing.
Each node in P2Pool shares the same work and issues the same collective payments. This makes it awesome for failover. Configure your miners with 10 different nodes and all of your work is coalesced as if you're mining on a single pool. Well, you ARE mining on a single pool :)

Yeah you could, but as thariam says, this is a crappy way to do it.
You're better off forgetting the blockchain on the offline computer and viewing balance(s) from any connected machine using blockchain.info, blockexplorer.com, or similar public site.
To spend from the offline machine, you can either craft manual transactions with the default bitcoin/litecoin clients and sign them, but it's far easier to use a system designed for watch/spend separated machines like Mycelium, Electrum, or Armory.
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:51:55
They didn't authenticate the chatter. 
That means that either the technician failed to ask the chatter for the PIN/passphrase on the account, OR there was no PIN/passphrase configured on the account. 
Which begs the question: did the exchange configure an authentication PIN/passphrase with their datacenter for remote support requests?

You were doing it right!
Stick with it.
Another thing that's 'different' about P2Pool is the payout rate. You won't notice anything for a bit, but that's also normal.
Starting tomorrow you'll get regular payouts and if you check at that time you'll be getting about the same or even slightly more than you averaged on a centralized pool.
When you stop mining you'll even notice the payments will continue to trickle in for about a day afterwards.
The way P2Pool does its payouts is a bit delayed, so don't think your mining isn't working if you don't get immediate payouts. You need to wait a day!

You're right - all transactions on the bitcoin network are public and readable by all. If someone learns that you own a particular address, they can trace all funds you spend from that address to any address where those coins flow.
The key to privacy with bitcoin is to prevent someone making that first link between one of your addresses and you.
To maximize privacy, never make a transaction that is tied to an identity on a system - for example, any system where you register your name.
You can make use of many privacy-enhancing technologies to increase the chances of keeping your identity private, including using TOR to issue all payments to the Bitcoin network.
You may wish to also read up on "stealth transactions" and darkwallet as these technologies make it even more difficult to identify the sources of funds, however they have a fairly steep learning curve above-and-beyond the already-steep curve of using Bitcoin itself.
Happy reading!

Tumbling isn't anonymization, it's just plausible deniability. It can be thought of like a bag of coins. 
Let's say you have 10 coins and want them obfuscated. You bring them into a room with a bunch of other people who bring their coins. You all put your coins in a bag and shake them all around together. 
At the end of the session you remove 10 coins from the bag and everyone else removes the same amount of coins they put in. 
If you were to look at your coins there's a good chance you're holding a mix of everyone else's coins. There's a slim chance you're holding some of the same coins you put into the bag. Either way, you have plausible deniability because tracing the coins would show they came from that bag. After that it's easy for you to say "I'm not the thief. I just used the bag; one of the other guys is your thief"

Thanks, bitcoin123112, for your thoughts. 
My opinion differs slightly. 
Forks happen all the time, but the trunk is always the strongest branch. 
This has happened with bitcoin's forks hundreds of times, and with Linux thousands of times. 
The trunk leads development and the branches follow. The people who write forks of Ethereum will never understand it as well as the authors do. 
As for your pre-sale comments, people bought thousands of Bitcoin when they were less than a penny under the same conditions. Saying it won't rise is equally as fallacious as me saying it will rise. 
Evaluate the tech and put your money where your mouth is. Either with Ethereum or against it.

The password doesn't add any security to the memorized seed. 
The seed is your password. 
While you could add encryption on top of your seed and force yourself to use the decryption password to recover the seed, your attackers don't have this restriction. If they have the seed they don't need a password. 
In short: your quest for a password is one that forces you to do more work without any benefit for security whatsoever. 
Be happy that you've memorized your keys.

I hear ya. 
I was there too. The Ponzi-ish nature you're talking about is the tip of the truth. 
What you're seeing is the realization that the only reason bitcoin has value at all is because we say it does. The part I was missing at your stage was that this is actually how ALL value works - not just bitcoin. We just never thought of it that way. 
Why is that $20 bill worth $20?
Why is gold worth gold?
This is the hardest hurdle to climb. The concept of "Value" isn't intrinsic at all and it doesn't exist in the gold or the $20 bill or the chicken you're buying. Value actually exists in your head. Or rather - in our collective heads. 
We all agree to exchange these bills and treat them at whatever value we agree to, therefore they are worth that value. Bitcoin is no different; it has value only because we all agree it does.
The true novelty of Bitcoin is that it's the first system that doesn't need someone to decree it has value like a king or a government. It's a collective decree voiced by everyone who uses it. 
Once you understand that, you realize the current trade price really doesn't matter in the long run.

Old addresses with minuscule balances have absolutely no costs for miners. 
Mining processes transactions that just occurred. Not addresses that haven't been used in ages. 
And if the addresses are used now and their minuscule balances are used in a transaction, if it is computationally expensive to process then it will need a fee. Now the miner gets paid for working with it.

I think you misunderstand the purpose of the blockchain.
It's designed to have a verifiable history of your coins since their coinbase transaction. If you "move your coins to a new address" and "removing them from the blockchain" then you no longer have any proof that those coins are legitimate.
The full chain from birth to current is required for anyone to be able to verify that the coins and the transactions amongst them are both valid.
Storage space gets cheaper every month. Currently the blockchain requires less than 6GB which costs just a few dollars. Calculations of blockchain size based on transaction volume estimates have been performed and show that this will remain negligible in the future.

So I'm fairly certain I understand how this service works, but I don't understand where the author comes in.
I AES-encrypt my wallet and upload it to his service, along with thousands of other Bitcoin enthusiasts. Every time I make a transaction, I log into his app, retrieve my encrypted wallet from his server, decrypt it locally, and can use my private keys to sign my coins to other people (aka: send money)
Blockchain.info will store thousands of encrypted wallets and host a beautiful web interface to access them. They also wrote apps for iOS and Android to facilitate this access to the wallets on their server.
Why is he doing this? Where's his profit?
Is a bitcent being taken from all transactions? I don't see how that can happen if he doesn't have access to our private keys.
Do the apps display ads? I couldn't find ads in the free app I downloaded, nor could I find ads on the website itself.

The best way to safely store and use your bitcoins. Ever.
I love having Armory on my home/work machines so I can see my wallet contents, but can't spend the coin since the private keys are on an old laptop that has 0 net connectivity.
It takes extra time to spend my coins, but the peace of mind knowing that NOBODY can steal my coins if they hack my connected machines is awesome. And it's not that hard either:
* Create a new transaction
* Save the unsigned transaction to a USB key
* Sign the transaction using my disconnected PC
* Use the connected machine to relay the signed transaction to the network.

Every transaction in the Bitcoin network is built on two things: inputs and outputs.
If you want to send 1BTC to someone, your client will look at the funds you currently have that are associated with various addresses you own. It'll chose one that has &gt;1BTC if it can and use that as the solitary input. There will be two outputs: your recipient's address (to receive the 1BTC) and another address that you control to receive the "change"
This is a simple transaction that would be only a few hundred bytes large.
A complex transaction would happen if you have 10BTC total made up of 1000 little 0.01BTC transactions. Now the transaction needs to compute 1000 inputs for 1 output of 1BTC. This will likely be large (multiple kilobytes) and take more time for miners to hash than other simple transactions. Most miners would refuse to spend work on this...unless they receive a fee for hashing it.
The fee is recommended whenever a transaction's size is large in order to incentivize miners to hash it instead of ignoring it.

As block-finding bonuses decrease over time (currently 50, will be 25 sometime in 2012, and will continue halving until the last bitcoin is dealt out), the incentive to mine bitcoin will also decrease over time.
There will be a point in the future where the block-finding bonus is not enough incentive to keep computing power on the network. In order to compensate for this, transaction fees will rise to ensure the block-finders continue having an incentive to find the hash for the next block.

How easy is it to get USD? You need to prepare a resume and hunt for a job, get through interviews and maybe background checks. Then you need to put in time and effort and wait a few weeks or a paycheque. 
What about getting credit? Applications, credit checks, ID, etc. 
Obtaining ANY currency is difficult.
You are 100% right that exchanges are the most difficult way of obtaining BTC. Thankfully it is NOT your only option. LocalBitcoins.com will show you BTC sellers in your area. You can meet at a local mcDonalds and swap cash and BTC at a mutually-agreeable price. 
Once you have cash it is easy to buy goods in person. Once you have credit it is easy to buy goods online. However once you have Bitcoin it is even easier to buy goods online. The difficult part of all 3 is obtaining that medium of exchange.

Bitcoin can easily address the deflation issue by using all 8 decimal places. In the event one Bitcoin becomes so expensive that the smallest unit (1 Satoshi = 1/10Millionth of a Bitcoin) is no longer small enough to represent a micropayment, the Bitcoin protocol supports "moving the decimal place."
The developers (with direction from the Bitcoin foundation) can plan a "split date" well in advance so that what was once 1BTC is now 0.01BTC, restoring our ability to have microtransactions.
In short: Bitcoin already addresses the deflation "issue" by being extremely divisible, AND supporting further divisibility in the event it ever becomes necessary.

I think you misunderstood. It isn't an opinion; Bitcoin truly is far more traceable than cash.
Given any transaction, anyone can trace where the funds came from before being used in that transaction. From there they can be traced back further and further until the coinbase transaction that initially minted them. This is possible because Bitcoin's ledger exists in the public blockchain that's downloaded on every node within the Bitcoin network.
While it's true that you may not always know the entity who owns each address in this chain, you can still trace the coins through each of these addresses in the chain. If any address has been reused, that information can then be used to assist in identification of the entity that owns it.
One very common misconception about Bitcoin is that it is anonymous. That is a fallacy. While Bitcoin can be used anonymously, care must be taken by the user to protect their anonymity through the use of other tools such as Tor, careful Bitcoin address/key creation, careful transaction creation, the use of 'change' addresses, etc. On its own, Bitcoin is not anonymous.
Bitcoin really is extremely traceable, and that is not an opinion.

Double-spending against SatoshiDice won't cheat any money out of the system.
SD always uses the bet's transaction as input when sending your win/loss. This means that if you successfully doublespend your coin to your own wallet instead of to SD, it's like you never made a bet in the first place.

@_date: 2013-03-31 17:57:42
Well, it could be considered a flaw of either the client that was used or a flaw in the way the user chose to move his funds.
Years ago, the original client did not pre-generate 100 addresses the first time the client was opened. Back then, whenever you sent funds the client would generate a new address immediately that was used for the 'change'. This was fine until someone made a backup of their wallet, sent 1btc to a friend, and went to restore his backup. All of his funds were lost because the 'change' was sent to a brand new address that did not exist in his backup.
Satoshi fixed this by making the default client pre-compute 100 addresses before any transactions occur. Every time funds are sent, the change goes to the oldest address and a brand new one is added at the end of the queue. By doing this, your backups are good as long as you haven't sent 100 transactions since your last backup.
I wouldn't consider this a flaw in the Bitcoin protocol because sending funds is designed to take inputs (the btc you hold) and send it to outputs (some btc to your recipient, the rest are sent back to yourself).
When dealing with digital cash like this it's super important to maintain regular backups, and to keep those backups secure. The original poster chose to perform manual edits of wallet files and he failed to create a backup after a transaction. These were his choices, and unfortunately it was an expensive lesson.
Finally, to address your last question: these weren't the first coins to become inaccessible, and they won't be the last. For each coin that is lost permanently, the remainder of the coins become that-much-more valuable. With each coin being divisible to 8 decimal places, there's more-than-enough room to accommodate a very high price.

I never mentioned a court. Not sure where that leap came from. 
Visa and Paypal serve as an escrow service for sales. 
Escrow services exist with Bitcoin which provide an honest mechanism for chargebacks if necessary. 
These services deter fraudulent shipments (or fraudulent claims of undelivered goods) through the use of a trusted third party. This protects honest buyers and honest sellers. 
Only dishonest people would incur losses as a result of their fraudulent actions.

Transaction fees within the Bitcoin network are based on the size (in KB) of your transaction.
The size of a transaction depends on the number of inputs that need to be spent in order to send money to your intended outputs.
Let's say three people each send you 1BTC. You have a total of 3BTC in your wallet that is made up of three 1BTC transactions.
If you want to send 0.5BTC to someone it's an easy transaction. One of your three 1BTC transactions will be used as a single input, and there will be two outputs: one sending 0.5BTC to your destination, and the remainder (change) will be sent to another address you control. 1 input, 2 outputs.
However if you want to send 2.9BTC to someone it takes more work. You need to create a transaction with 3 inputs (each of the 1BTC transactions) and two outputs (2.9BTC to your destination, and the change to yourself). This transaction will take up more bytes on the blockchain because it is using more inputs.
When you deal with SatoshiDice you get a lot of tiny transactions sent to you for your lost rolls. If you want to send 1BTC to someone you may need to sign 20 different 0.05BTC inputs which can lead to a rather large transaction.
I don't know the thresholds off the top of my head for when a higher fee is required but I hope I've illustrated the concept well enough.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:40:55
Do research yourself. Don't listen to opinion, rather read facts and form your own opinion.
Seek other opinions only after you've formed your own, and always Always ALWAYS ask what facts they base THEIR opinion on.
Ultimately: once your opinion feels "complete" and you no longer question whether it's based on facts or emotion, act on it. Even if you turn out to be wrong and you lose money, you will be able to look back and say "given all of the facts available at the time, I know I made the right decision"

Bitcoins cannot be destroyed. If you have 5btc and you want to send 1btc to somewhere else, most clients generate a new address for the 4btc "change". Many wallets pre-generate a list of 100 addresses to be used for 'change' so that they can be backed up early before they're ever used. 
In this case the poster used a non-standard client and did not back up the address where his 'change' was sent causing him to lose the remainder of his funds.

Unless you specifically changed WinRAR's settings, the passwords.txt file existed unencrypted within C:\Users\jamey2244\Local Settings\Temp

Yes it's secure, but there are weaknesses:
* Deleting armory won't permanently delete the private keys. They can be recovered with "undelete" software and forensic analysis. To mitigate this risk, you should wipe the wallet with disk wiping software instead of just deleting it
* You didn't test the recovery of your keys to confirm they're printed OK on the paper. I would run through recovering the wallet just to give yourself peace of mind that your funds are indeed safe.
Other than that, yes you've got a pretty secure electronic safe in your safety deposit box.
One of the benefits of Armory is the ability to create "watch only" wallets which allow you to see the balance without having the keys to spend it. For your peace of mind, I would create a watch-only copy of the wallet after you create it so that once you wipe/destroy the wallet you can still see how much is in it... and you'll see the funds grow with your dividends.
As an aside, Electrum offers similar features (offline wallets, watch-only copies, etc.) without the necessity to download the entire blockchain which currently sits at 8GB. In a few years when you decide to spend your funds, the blockchain may be 16GB or larger which may or may not make for an annoying recovery experience.

This would require a significant amount of work to pull off, and would only be used in a very small amount of circumstances.
For most transactions, 4296 characters are more than enough. Even 'large' transactions won't take up 2500 characters.
You'd only go over 4296 characters if your transaction is made up of 100s of dust inputs that were being sent to 100s of dust outputs. Yes this is possible, but not likely.
And in the few cases where this actually occurs, and the transaction to be signed is larger than 4296 characters, the transaction can still be signed offline using the existing "save to file" functionality.

If your server had full disk encryption, how did the attacker write a file to /etc/bitcoin.sh ?
Once the KVM was attached to your server, they can try to log in but they don't have the root password. How would they log in?
My guess from what you've written is:
* They couldn't log in once they connected to the RKVM
* They rebooted the machine to get into single-user mode
* Once in single-user mode they wrote /etc/bitcoin.sh because you misspoke: you don't have full disk encryption. You have an encrypted partition on a plain disk, and /etc is part of the plain disk.

Yes, Blockchain.info presents the technical details of what's occurring inside the block in a format that makes it easy for non-technical people to understand. It's a great site, but it glosses over the internals.
Please look into what a [coinbase]( transaction is, and how traditional [transactions]( specify their [outputs](
The two batches of coins are distinct from each other, and are represented differently within the actual Bitcoin blockchain. blockchain.info displays them as a combined reward to simplify the layout for visual consumption. After all, they are both given to the miner, so it's simpler to think of them all as coming from the same place despite how the blockchain actually works under the hood.

Biometric authentication is the most inferior method of authentication, yet movies glamorize it and make it seem futuristic and secure. 
1. Key revocation. If someone learns your password, just change it and they can't get in. If someone copies your key, change the lock. If someone copies your thumbprint, what do you do? Cut off your thumb? Sure you can switch to another finger but not many times. A compromised biometric authenticator prevents you from EVER using it again, and you only have a scarce few. 
2. Public nature. Every biometric authenticator exists in the public domain by default. Every glass you hold copies your fingerprints. Every photograph captures an angle of your facial geometry. High res photos can capture your retina from the right angle. It's the equivalent to wearing your password on a sticker on your forehead while walking in public. Why would you do that?
3. Margin of error. Human bodies change over time, requiring biometric authentication to accept a margin of leeway. What if you cut your finger? Play more guitar than usual? Get a swollen eye? Biometric devices need to accept signatures that are slightly off to authenticate you. It's like typing your password a little wrong. "Well, he got the first 3 characters right so it must be him! Let him in anyways."  You wouldn't accept an unmatched password for login so why accept a dodgy biometric read?
In short: biometrics are the least secure form of authentication. Stick to knowledge-based and possession-based authentication. Mix the two to maximize security.

That's a valid opinion, but mine is different. 
It offers irreversibility which PayPal and credit cards do not. This gives me peace of mind knowing that a buyer can't lie to PayPal and claim he didn't receive an item causing PayPal to return my money to a scammer. 
Bitcoin also offers the ability to transact with negligible fees. I don't have to pay large %s of the cash I want to send to someone online. The same is offered to merchants who want to accept electronic payments without paying 3% fees to Visa. 
Third, Bitcoin offers verifiability without any reliance on buyer or seller. A merchant can lose his copy of a receipt casting doubt on whether or not you really did buy that thing with cash. With Bitcoin, we can both refer to the blockchain as irrefutable evidence that this transaction truly did occur and the purchase is legitimate. 
You're entitled to your opinions, but for my own I believe Bitcoin offers much more value than traditional methodologies.

The hashes aren't useless. The hashes prove that someone completed work in order to persist these transactions onto the end of the blockchain.
It's a proof of work.
If the work wasn't hashing, but was instead gene folding, SETI processing, or any other kind of "useful" work, that work could then be gamed. Someone could figure out how to fold a particular gene successfully in advance and then write the solution in the blockchain, granting themselves 25BTC. Someone could preprocess some SETI noise and write their solution on the blockchain, granting themselves 25BTC.
The proof of work needs to also contain proof that the work was done "right now" on these very transactions that are being added to the chain to ensure the system isn't being gamed for someone's monetary gain.
Hope that helps,

I'm sorry, but you misunderstand how Bitcoin works. This isn't a "terminology argument."
Bitcoins are immutable; they cannot be destroyed.
The fees that are given to miners come from inputs to transactions. These are not clean and are not new. They could have passed through thousands of transactions, and passed through thousands of hands before being spent in a transaction that did not specify them as an output.
I will agree with you that these old coins are combined with new coins (defined in the coinbase transaction) and paid as specified by the miner, but even you had to use the terms "old coins" and "new coins" when describing what happens. They're distinct and different.

38 BTC for 20x1oz. Silver coins
Each coin holds 1BTC.
That means (38 - 20) = 18BTC spent per 20 coins. 
(18BTC / 20coins) = 0.9BTC extra per coin. 
(0.9BTC x $100USD) = $90USD 'extra' per coin. 
Current spot price ov Silver is less than $19USD. 
($90USD -$19USD) = $71USD. 
So the real cost of each 1oz silver 1BTC coin is $71USD.

The word sequence Electrum uses to seed its wallets has 128bits of entropy in contrast with the 256bits of entropy given with raw Bitcoin addresses.
I use Electrum and like it. However it's important to stress that **ANYTHING** that makes a passphrase easier to remember reduces entropy *by definition*. 
Our brains are wired for pattern matching. Our limbic systems do this without our conscious thought so we can identify food better, hunt it more effectively, and even reproduce better. This knack for recognizing and making patterns is completely opposed to the randomization required for making a good key.
Even if you smash your keyboard "randomly" your brain will naturally try to effect some form of order on your smashes.
Because of this, **NOTHING** that is "easier to remember" will **EVER** be equally as secure as something that is not. 
Security is composed of three competing goals: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
If you want to increase availability (by making a key easier to remember) that will simultaneously reduce either integrity, confidentiality, or both.

Another point that took me a bit to figure out...
At the bottom of the graph there are "Period" links: W1 D3 D1 H4 H1 M15 M5 M3 M1
These links change the width of the candle bars.
By default each candle represents 1 minute (M1) of time; a green bar represents that minute closed higher than the previous. Red means it closed lower.
M5 makes the bars represent 5 Minutes;
H1 makes them represent 1 Hour;
D1 = 1 Day;
W1 = 1 Week;
So as you click these links your graph compresses more time so you can see further into the past.

Bitcoin transactions are built from a set of inputs and a set of outputs.
When you first received your 100BTC, you likely received it in smaller batches. Perhaps one transfer of 25BTC, another transfer of 50BTC, and a third transfer of 25BTC. Combined this adds up to the 100BTC signed to that address, but it's still made up of the original 3 inputs that put the funds there.
When you send funds, your client grabs some of these original transactions as inputs to a new transaction. For example, if you want to send 30BTC to someone, your client has only three transactions to use as input: 1x25, 1x50, and 1x25. Your client will likely choose the 50btc input, send 30btc to your destination, and the remaining 20btc as change to a new address you control. 
This is why some funds remain (those two 25BTC inputs were not used) and why some funds went to a new address (the change from the 50-30).

The coins spent as a fee of a transaction are not in the coinbase transaction of a new block.
A coinbase transaction creates new coins that enter the Bitcoin economy from the creation of that block. Currently, this amounts to exactly 25 bitcoins - no more, no less. This transaction is independent from the fees attached to the transactions included in that block.
Take a closer look at the protocol for more information. There is no "forging" or "recasting" of any of the bitcoins used in transactions included in that block. Those bitcoins are not "new coinage" and it is nothing like "salting gold."

I think you misunderstood. You didn't give proof that an easier-to-remember key is equally secure as one that is completely random.
You are correct that it is easier to remember words than it is to remember a long string of random characters. Following along, if you were to map easy-to-remember words to discrete parts of a 256-bit private key, yes it will be easier to remember. However this will still decrease the security of the information.
Consider this...
You have a super-difficult password that can't easily be remembered, so you write it down. By writing it down, you compromise the confidentiality of that information while increasing the availability of it.
Now let's look at your scenario.
Take a 52-character private key, but instead of remembering 52 individual characters, split it into 13 "words" of 4 characters each. It's the same key, but remembered in 13 pieces instead of 52.
Now make a lookup table so that:
* "dF8Z" maps to the word "pumpkin"
* "A98d" maps to the word "stapler"
* "d1kdP" maps to the word "teapot"
* etc.
So in the end you remember 13 easy-to-remember words like "pumpkin stapler teapot wallet card dock light pin bowl picture red hair"
Yes, this is much easier to remember, however it comes at the expense of either integrity or availability.
You now need to remember each of the 13 words ***as well as*** each of the mappings. This increases the likelihood that you will forget something, compromising the integrity of the original information.
Or you need to write down all of the mappings for everything and keep this "codebook" somewhere secure. Writing this down compromises the confidentiality of the information.
Or write/find a computer program to consult a lookup table on your behalf. This means you need to share your 13 words with this program, still compromising the confidentiality.
And, since this lookup table/dictionary of English words map to 4-character sections of a key, you'll run into a problem: there are not enough words in the English language to cover all possible 4character combinations of a private key. So you will have to leave out a large number of 4character combinations that simply don't have an English-word mapping. This decreases the entropy of your lookup-table system from the original 2^256 to (NumEnglishWordsInDictionary)^NumberOfPieces where NumberOfPieces is 13 in this example. That keyspace is smaller than 2^256.
No matter which way you skin it, if you choose to increase any point of the C-I-A triangle, you **WILL** decrease one/both of the other points.
You cannot gain availability without sacrificing confidentiality, integrity, or both.

Buying a car with cash would involve a lot of counting of bills to make sure the correct amount is in the suitcase. With Bitcoin you'd see the total appear in your wallet immediately. 
As for credit cards, have you ever accepted payment from someone else via credit card? You need to register as a merchant, sign a merchant agreement, purchase equipment to swipe the card or read the chip, then retain the records of the sale for years while complying with PCI regulations.

You could keep the transaction private by only broadcasting it to your node so it ends up in the next block you successfully mine...

I'm not treating the brain as a storage device that bases ease-of-memory on entropy.
What I'm saying is, security is a 3-point balance between Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Any effort to increase the availability of information will simultaneously decrease either/both of Integrity and Availability. Because of this, anything that is "easier to remember" cannot simultaneously offer equal confidentiality and integrity.
Hope I've clarified.
@_date: 2013-01-23 23:23:56
Yes and no.
SatoshiDice doesn't increase your fees, but larger transactions do.
The requirement to attach a higher fee is a result of using a large amount of inputs that can cover your output. If you're regularly re-betting your SatoshiDice losses then yes, your client will suggest you attach higher fees to the larger transactions. For more info see 
Now it's possible to override the suggestion and attach 0btc fees for all of your transactions. When your transaction is broadcast to the network, many nodes will ignore it because it's too much work for no reward, but there are still quite a few nodes out there who process all transactions for the good of the network.
On average your transactions may take a lot longer to finally make it into the blockchain if you have no fee attached. It's possible for the transaction to never be included in a block and sit there as "unconfirmed" forever.
To ensure your transactions are picked up and added to the next found block, always add a fee and you won't have to wait.

I wrote this patch so am able to comment.
1st, the link you posted was to a discussion about Armory, not Electrum.
2nd, regarding the encoding of data, the QR code displays the JSON output of the mktx command already in Electrum. An example of this output looks like this:
    {
        "complete": false, 
        "hex": "010000000296f054a6eccd3051444aec20e9c5c9b58739e70c7d958e4eb03587acf99d02e70000000000ffffffffdf350752fe6e27534633bb59327d9feb347756fe8d6e5b0b56312aca57df0eb30000000000ffffffff02f4345c35000000001976a914aaf437e25805f288141bfcdc27887ee5492bd13188ac80969800000000001976a91481acc8b7f9ec7cbf45a02dd8b758c6ac6a1481ca88ac00000000", 
        "input_info": "[{'scriptPubKey':'76a91411bbdc6e3a27c44644d83f783ca7df3bdc2778e688ac','electrumKeyID':(15,False),'vout':0,'txid':u'e7029df9ac8735b04e8e957d0ce73987b5c9c5e920ec4a445130cdeca654f096'},{'scriptPubKey':'76a914aaf437e25805f288141bfcdc27887ee5492bd13188ac','electrumKeyID':(112,True),'vout':0,'txid':u'b30edf57ca2a31560b5b6e8dfe567734eb9f7d3259bb334653276efe520735df'}]"
    }
The type of QR code I chose has a maximum capacity of 4296 characters of data. This should be enough for the vast majority of transactions that use a reasonable number of inputs and specify a reasonable number of outputs. But you're right, there is still a limitation of 4296 characters.
The example I posted above has about 550 characters, so we're good for 4x the standard transaction size.
In the event the text is too large and cannot be displayed properly in a QRcode, the window will be white/blank. At this point, the existing "Save transaction to file" method will of course still work so you can still get your transaction signed that way.
Now that I think about it, perhaps I should display an error to the user if it's too large: "The transaction you're trying to sign is too large to display as a QR code. You will need to save the transaction to a file instead."

This ensures that only the holder of your yubikey can take money out.
You can still log in and execute trades with only your password so you'll be able to buy/sell at any price as the market booms/crashes.
If you lose your yubikey you can still trade but won't be able to withdraw your funds until the replacement arrives.
Hope that helps,

Bitcoin can't survive off of any form of medical research.
Let's say it's searching for a cure for HIV. Once HIV has a cure, what happens to the monetary system?
If it's gene folding... what happens if a bright doctor comes up with a way to identify folded genes without brute force? Then they can apply this research to solving blocks immediately with a single stroke of a pen. Bam Bam Bam Bam: +25 +25 +25 +25.
The work needs to be "useless" and be based off of the "current" transactions that must be added to the end of the chain.

The last Wednesday meetup had about 50 people.
This meetup there wasn't a Reddit announcement until the morning of the meet, so I expect there to be less, but who knows. Maybe attendees from last meeting told their friends :)

I'd totally use p2pool instead.
Centralized pools are regularly targeted by DDOS attacks, and/or are subject to going down because there is 1 central point of failure.
P2pool is like having thousands of pool servers that all coordinate together. The payouts to your wallet are coinbase transactions just like Eligius' payouts, but you don't have to worry about failure.
Also, P2pool takes 0 fees from you and passes all block transaction fees to you as well. Most centralized pools take a cut of your work, including Eligius.
If you don't know how to set up p2pool on your own, there are hundreds of public nodes available. Each public node is part of the exact same network so it doesn't matter which node you use, or if you hop between 10 different nodes. You'll get the same payouts.
My public node:

I bought when Bitcoin was at an all-time high of $34.20.
I did it because I feel Bitcoin is worth so much more than that. 
So far I am not regretting that decision

Bitcoin doesn't need to be stabilized to be used as a medium of exchange. 
Check out BitPay. They remove 100% of the risk associated with a fluctuating USD/BTC trade price for merchants. 
Merchants accept BTC payments from customers and USD is seamlessly deposited into their bank account whether the price of BTC rose or fell after the transaction.

Simple oneliner rebuttal: Ponzi schemes take fees from late-joiners to pay off early-joiners, requiring exponential growth to sustain itself.
Bitcoin does not require a buy-in fee that goes to any early-adopter, nor does it require new-joiners to find x newer-joiners in order to break even.

You are the bank, and your wallets are your bank accounts. 
Your chequing account is your hot wallet, accessible from your mobile phone. 
Your interest-bearing savings account is your cold wallet where your coins appreciate over time. 
Neither accounts require fees to keep open, and nobody closes them due to inactivity. 
Welcome to the future.

You're safe, Miracle.
Armory uses a deterministic wallet unlike the standard reference client and multibit. Every keypair generated by Armory is recoverable from the initial seed that was used to create the wallet.
Whenever your offline computer signs a transaction, it sends the change to a new address created by that wallet. This address is automatically recoverable from the wallet seed.
In short: By default, Armory prevents the situation encountered by the original poster. However, it does have the option to manually import keys which are NOT generated by the wallet seed. This is a manual operation and would need to be backed up separately. As long as you're not doing any manual import/export/etc. operations, Armory will protect every address it ever creates by default.

Bitcoin is the name of the reference software originally written by Satoshi.
Bitcoin is also the name of the protocol used by this software to communicate with other nodes on the network.
Bitcoin is also the name of the unit of account used by this protocol and software.

Yes you are improving ;)
These 'Canadians' forgot the golden rule: always proofread ANYTHING PUBLIC before posting!
@_date: 2013-03-31 18:28:30
You misunderstood.
The new addresses are created and place into your wallet. They're just like any other address in your wallet. You have full control to back these up any time you like, export them, import them elsewhere...whatever you want to do.
They're completely within your control.

of course they are.

This would create a cold hardware wallet from an android phone, but I wouldn't recommend it.
A smartphone is designed as a communication device and has a lot of antennas to help it do this.
I would always be worried that whatever software hacks I applied don't completely disable the antennas. A physical modification of the smartphone would be better, but each of the tranceivers are built right onto the board making it difficult to disable. It's not like a laptop where you can physically remove the bluetooth/wifi module.
I'd sooner recommend an old netbook/eeePC for this purpose since you can easily open 'em up to rip out the wireless modules.

How does he know it's a hot wallet?
It's an address with many coins signed to it. It could very well be cold.

The compromised coin still had tool marks that were visible. They gave the attack a 6/10 because although the hologram wasn't damaged when it was removed/replaced, it was still evident that it was tampered with. 
Before we could the coin if the sticker was whole.
Now we have to inspect the sticker too. 
No big deal

Just mount the chips on the circuitboard you designed, then use the controller code you wrote for your controller to feed work to the chip so it can hash for you.
Take the result and if it meets the current target/difficulty, broadcast it to the network.
So simple!!
@_date: 2013-05-28 02:52:41
That's it. 
Aim the offline laptop at the online screen. Sign. Aim the online laptop at the offline one. Broadcast. 
Offline transaction complete.

You cannot get rid of an address... and you shouldn't want to either.
Bitcoin is designed so that one person will have thousands++ of addresses through normal use. This is perfectly normal.
Every time you use one address in your list, Electrum will create a new one in the background for you. Remember when you first started Electrum it asked you for the "Gap limit" and you likely left it at 5?
This means that Electrum will always try to keep 5 unused addresses in your wallet. As you use them up, more will be created so you always have 5 unused ones.
With Electrum you don't need to create brand new addresses manually. The client does this for you in the background as you use the existing ones.
In short: don't worry about it, and expect to see many many more get created for you!

Bitcoin's value is determined by two things:
1. Supply and demand
2. Perception of utility. 
The perception of utility is the more dominant force. The more useful it is as a medium of exchange between consumers and merchants, the higher the price Bitcoin commands.

The effect on difficulty will be the same whether the units are mining on their premises or in your home.
