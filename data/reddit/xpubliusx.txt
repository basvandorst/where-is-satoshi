Whatever, snowflake.

Please, never say “okay boomer.”  It makes you sound like a dumb kid without any substantive arguments.  
You aren’t responding to the argument when you say “okay boomer.”  You are arrogantly dismissing it.  If I were a baby boomer and somebody said that to me, I’d think the appropriate response would be “whatever, snowflake”.
@_date: 2019-11-11 02:16:48
Look at what a great debate “whatever snowflake” and “okay boomer” engenders!  
We are really speaking to each other here.  And while I might disagree with what you say, I will defend to the death your right to say it....

Even so, Bitcoin has still managed to butt fuck me.

50%?   That’s a bit high.  What countries are you I including in that?  This is not the 18th century.

A 2% daily increase doesn’t qualify for a vertical rollercoaster gif.

Find a bitcoin ATM and buy it from there.  Some do not require ID.

Not really.  There is no reason to doubt that the gospels were written by the eponymous authors.  And you can tell who wrote the epistles because they identify themselves, mostly Paul.   I’m not as sure about the Old Testament authorship.   
But at any rate, this post was not about the authorship of the Bible in general—it was about the specific claim that the Bible was “written by God.”   My point is, nobody is claiming that it was written by God.   
@_date: 2019-02-27 05:38:29
Christians have never said that the Bible was written by God.  Maybe you’re confusing that with the Koran, which is said to be the literal word of God.

No way this could have been created after the fact.

I don’t know what that means.

So I don’t mean to be a kill joy, but it looks like his selling the Bitcoins was part of a court order to pay off Mt Gox’s creditor.   They are required to do this legally.  A trustee can’t just act willy nilly— he is only doing this because he has an obligation to the beneficiaries of the trust.  
He does not have an obligation to the market.  And nobody involved in ANY market should assume that everybody else is going to hold their coins and never sell.  
Bitcoins price will be healthy when it’s based on the demand for bitcoins themselves. Whether it is so that they can be used as a currency or a store of value.  
If a whale decides to sell for whatever reason, that’s just part of the market.  There is really no sense in whining about it.

Funny video.  Ridiculously inaccurate history though.  Gold had been recognized as a currency for millennia prior to this period.   Also, the western empire had collapsed 200 years prior, nobody would be wearing togas in Europe.

This is how I’ll be spending it!  Minus the sparkler.  Fire hazard.

I read it.  Still don’t know how it gets to a loan.  Or an interest rate on a stable currency for that matter.  
@_date: 2019-01-28 02:48:57
Yeah..... ummm. Pretty certain weed is the thing that bitcoin has been used for buying the most of anything....
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:22:07
Yes, the video is dumb and, from a technical standpoint, completely inaccurate.  The comparison of a bitcoin to the goat is entirely inaccurate.  While a digital representation of a goat could be replicated infinitely (and therefore is the epitome of the "double spending" problem) Bitcoin solved the double spending problem.  Other things could be said.  
Still, this is the kind that is necessary to mass adoption.  It might be geared towards idiots, but by definition approximately 3.5 billion people in this world are in the lower 50 percentile of intelligence.

You're welcome.  It was a well thought out piece.  I definitely appreciated it, and you're right--psychologically goes hand in hand.  It's interesting from the point of view of behavior economics.  And its a combo you see so frequently in the cypto markets.  There are some major inefficiencies here that I think an experienced trader who understands them can currently exploit to his benefit.  
Would be interested in analysis you on buying the dip vs. HODL, too.  Especially to compare it with the FOMO/weak hands combo.

Many miners will leave.  But if many leave then that will decrease the difficulty of the mining algorithms for the other miners that remain.  This will make it more profitable to mine bitcoin using the same hashing power.  The most efficient miners will remain and continue to mine.  Bitcoin might be worth 50% less but they will be able to mine 50% more of it.  (Not the actual projection, but just by way of example).   This is why it will never go to “zero.”
If your point is that the cost can go down a lot, then yes.   That is possible.  And you’re also correct that a lot of mining operations would go belly up.  But that’s not what Vanguard’s economist is saying.

Glad to see this.  I'd certainly want to use that.

Hey guys, welcome to capitalism. Where good intentions are not necessary for an economically beneficial outcome.   
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:49:42
Chief FUD-onomist.  If he thinks Bitcoin goes to zero, then he clearly does not even understand the basics of it.  No miner is going to give away his bitcoins for zero.   
And to say it’s a probability rather than a possibility?  Stick with index funds Vanguard.  I don’t think they have this whole “predicting the future” thing perfected yet.
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:58:59
Curious to know how this works out.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:57:21
Where are you going? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:35:24
Interesting analysis.  FOMO and weak hands are definitely the worst combination.  It's helpful to see data to back up this claim.  
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:12:31
Thing is, Bitcoin serves many of the same purposes as gold and its value is based on similar arguments.  Most notably limited supply making it deflationary and a store of value.

I’m sorry. I didn’t know you were an eye witness.  Tell us what you saw about McAfee’s alleged crimes.   
And yes, I’ve seen what flimsy innuendo and half truths or outright falsity will sucker the public.  I’m not interested in the low standards “modern society” has for truth.  These are people who think the Kardashians are credible just because they are famous.
