Sometimes you need to do an experiment in real life to get the real answers to questions. Bitcoin is an experiment to find the answer to these questions, as its founder(s) clearly stated.

Bitcoin is not really a currency, more a payment system - a way to transfer value around the globe instantly and at almost zero cost.
Email is to letters, Fedex and faxes; as Bitcoin is to credit cards, bank transfers and Western Union.
So I would use Bitcoin to buy a $2,500 PC say 3% cheaper, because the vendor is not paying credit card fees and does not have to allow for chargeback costs.
Or maybe I use Bitcoin to transfer money back home to my family in India. Instead of using the bank or Western Union and paying a big amount in fees and bad exchange rates, I can just use Bitcoin which is instant.
If I ran a company selling water pumps in the USA, I may be wary about accepting orders from many areas in Africa and Asia due to fraud. I really would not trust credit cards or PayPal, and even bank transfers can be reversed after months (a little known fact); plus they can take days or weeks. But I would have no problem with Bitcoin.
So in many, many ways, a large Bitcoin market would make doing business easier and quicker and would help expand the economy.
Now Bitcoin can allow people to evade taxes in certain situations - but so can cash. And folks can use it for money laundering and other stuff - but the banks have been helping with this so far!
So the US government would only start to become really worried if the use of Bitcoin was depressing their tax revenue to a degree that out-weighed its advantages. Just the same as with cash. I'm not sure that's ever going to happen in my view, as I think Bitcoin will become too useful.
And I don't believe that Bitcoin is going to threaten the dollar. The US government will always require tax in USD; they will only increase the money supply with USD; US bonds will only ever be in USD; and banks and such like will only every make loans in USD.
So to answer your questions: on the grounds that it effects their ability to collect taxes easily, fairly and equitably.

Hi - take a look at this great video here from a Bitcoin conference. Basically, it explains why the price of Bitcoins is irrelevant (if you want it to be) when you are buying &amp; selling goods and services.
Also note that for many users: those wanting anonymity and/or those wanting to transfer funds out of the control of local banks and government, some fluctuation in the price of BTC is not an issue.
@_date: 2013-03-23 16:51:10
 is your best bet. They have tied-in with a French bank, so your EURO deposits with them are fully insured should they disappear. Note that any Bitcoins you hold with them will NOT be covered. They have a fairly high volume. And they have very responsive technical support.
Have a look here to see all the exchanges: 
Select the filter symbol at the top left, and then select only Euros. Now you will see all the Euro exchanges listed by volume.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:20:47
YAWN! The price of Bitcoin doesn't matter - it's a way of transferring value globally. So the price is irrelevant, and the talk of it being a currency in the classic sense in just silly.
I can show you another gem by your beloved Krugman from 1998:
"The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in 'Metcalfe’s law' – which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants–becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s".

You make a very valid point. Think of it this way: if Bitcoins explodes, and is adopted widely around the world, then you may indeed find what you think becoming true. People's "reference" currency will be Bitcoins and not EUR or USD.
Does the average user of USD today care how many BTC they could get for their money? No. So in the future, the reverse may happen - users of BTC will not care how many USD they will get for their money.
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:52:19
It's partly to do with the number of buyers and sellers, and also partly to do with the simple prices they enter as orders. There is nothing to stop you entering a buy price at Bitcoin-24 that is lower than the current ask prices to see if someone takes you up on your offer.
You will also find arbitrage dealers who buy and sell between the different exchanges to make money on the price differences; but as the Bitcoin market is not so big, and as the exchanges are slow and charge quite high fees often, the market is not very "liquid" and thus there can be large prices differences.
In the main FOREX world a difference of 2 EUR would be unheard of, as the arbitrage is so vast and fast.
Interestingly, you will see that there is often a gap between the current highest ask and bid prices - the "spread". In FOREX, and in stocks, the exchanges will pay certain brokers and dealers to keep this spread low (tight), to encourage more business through the exchange.

Sorry, I think you are living in La La land.
The only thing that will set the price and stability of Bitcoin is market forces.

@_date: 2013-04-02 16:15:23
"Money laundering" means that you have got the money from some illegal activity such as drug manufacturing or dealing, and you have the money in a foreign bank account in say Columbia, or you have a huge stash of dollar bills.
Or perhaps you have stolen the money from a company, or you are a corrupt politician.
Now you want to move the funds to a nice safe place like London and then spend it on a big house, cars, paintings etc. The problem is that the UK banks will say "where did you get all that money from", take a copy of your passport and other ID and then report you to the authorities.
Even if you manage to get round all this, if you start buying big houses and legit companies and the like, the tax authorities will start asking where you got the money from. This is actually how they get most tax cheats and money launderers.
Your issue is a bit different in that you have a huge stash of Bitcoins. If you just keep them as Bitcoins there should not really be an issue. But if you convert them into currency at an exchange, then not only would the exchange log the deal with the authorities, but you would have to put the funds into a bank account, and they would also ask questions. The question is how would the tax authorities treat this. Would it be taxable as a capital gain?
Another interesting issue arises. Some capital gains tax is calculated not when you "realise" the asset - such as when you sell the house; but on what it's worth at the end of the tax year. This has caught many folks out during the crash. e.g.: you company gives you shares, and at the end of the tax year, those have risen in value by say $100 each (they went from $75 to $175), but by the time you come to have to pay the tax on that capital gain, they have LOST say $50 in value from the start (then are now only worth $25). But the tax folks will tax you on the $100 gain and you have to pay! You will only be able to backclaim the loss in the next tax year. How will Bitcoins be treated?
But however you deal with the situation, if you end up with a load of stuff that you can't explain where it came from the tax folks will get you.
It's going to be interesting to see how this all pans out. For instance, in the future will you be able to exchange Bitcoins in some tax haven and then by a villa in that tax have with the proceeds? Or indeed by a villa direct just in Bitcoins? Already you can by stuff fairly untraceable via 
My advice would be that there is no such thing as "tax" and "governments". Instead I think of "invoices for services" and "we, the people". You have made lots of money, and if it was not for the facilities (schools, hospitals, research), services (police, army, firefighters) and property (bridges, roads, airports) of "the people", this would never have happened. So now you need to pay your "invoice" from "the people" for these services. What is wrong with that?
The endless moaning about "tax" the "government", is just Orwellian double-speak created by rich people to steal money from ordinary folks.
Remember that it was government military (and other) research that invented (effectively) the internet, computers and encryption.
Just pay the capital gains tax (heck, it's not that much!) and then sleep easy that you are a moral, good and just human. You will be able to hold your head up high and your children will look up to you.

Sounds great. Make a big deal of the fact that you will not have to pay via credit card or PayPal. Thus you save the 2/3% the credit cards charge and the 4/5% PayPal charge. Plus, you need to let folks know that they will not have to utilise the terribly bad credit card and PayPal exchange rates; nor the fee they may charge. Nor will you have to allow for chargebacks.

This is way I traded from the UK: I used  to convert GBP to EUR and send to  via SEPA. Bitcoin Central have a tie-in with a French bank, and so are reasonably safe; but their prices are not the best, and they charge a fee. 
You could try  as they have much bigger volume, and they charge NO fee - just a small deposit &amp; withdrawal fee. But I can't seem to see who owns and runs them, and so I would only trade small amounts there. What is to stop them just running off with your money and BTC?
SEPA is the Euro area bank transfer system, and has low or zero fees. Plus it is very fast - next day most of the time. So if you use  you DON'T need to pay extra for a "fast" transfer. Note that  will give you a much better exchange rate than your bank, and will charge a smaller fee.
I think that mtGox have issues with their Barclays UK bank account at the moment; and possibly also SEPA issues.
If you are going to start trading and having funds going in and out, then you may consider opening a Euro bank account with your UK bank.

Seeing these drops is excellent and understandable. It's obvious that many of those with thousands of BTC are going to start selling some of them to by that fancy car etc. But then notice how fairly quickly the slack in taken-up and the price starts to go up again because so many folks want to buy.
This is a good think, as if there were too few BTC to sell, the price would rocket and be viewed as huge bubble.

We are offering a 5% discount if you pay with Bitcoin - this is to get folks interested and started. Plus we have run a workshop to explain BTC to everyone and show them how to buy BTC and run a safe wallet etc.

Wow, you're back. That was quick :-) Want some more of that "abuse" eh?


It's a very good example of how a very large and powerful corporation was unable to use its political power to avoid its destruction by a new technology. That's the point.


You claim to have spend "multiple months living on each continent". So maybe you noticed on your travels that other countries have "police forces", "governments", "regulations", "laws", and such like? The USA is not the only country with such things!


Granted, it's a half-example. In the broken window fallacy, no one gains anything by the window being broken, apart from the guy who comes to fix it. But in the drug world, you have to remember that *people buy drugs because it's a product they want and like*. Just like ice-cream or iPhones. So there is a seller and a buyer - it's business. And maybe the solution to the waste of resources is less regulation; not more?


Sorry, it is not even an example - never mind a "perfect one". People evading taxes is illegal; it's just theft from others. There is no overall depletion of a resource.


True, but that's not the point. The point is that those who run all those corporations: prisons, private security, armaments, drug rehabilitation etc., don't care about any of the stuff you list - schools, healthcare All they care about is making big $$$. As long as there are lots of jobs created - to keep folks quiet - then the powers-that-be are happy. This is why Bitcoin **may** not be seen **on balance** as a threat to them - if it smooths the drug trade, then great.


It's not meaningless; actually, it gets to the heart of the matter. You are making the arguments that governments are somehow at their heart about doing "good" and fighting "illegal" stuff. But at their heart, they are about being re-elected and ensuring the continuity and security of the state; eg: keeping power for a small cabal of rich and influential people. This is what directs their thinking. And if the international drug trade supports this, then they will at the very least tolerate it, whilst of course making lots of noises to the public that it's bad etc.

@_date: 2013-04-05 23:52:28
Bitcoin has the code for an escrow service already built in. Someone needs to develop it. Here is how it could work:
The buyer sends their BTC to an agreed escrow address. Then either the buyer can release the BTC to the seller when they receive the goods; or the seller can refund the buyer if they need to. But neither can take the BTC.
When the purchaser receives the goods, they click on an email or account link, and the BTC get released to the seller.
If there is a dispute, a human has to step in and adjudicate. They have a 3rd key. They cannot access the BTC themselves; but they can release the BTC one way or the other, together with the key of that party.
There is a small fee for the use of the service, as 99.9% of the time no human is required.
An improvement would be to link in with UPS or such like, so that the delivery label has a QR code on it, and that must be scanned by the buyer before the delivery guy hands it over. At that point, the funds are auto-released.

My overall view is this: Like most things in life, there are upsides and downsides: Cars are great, but they can kill people. Cash is useful, but folks kill for it and deal drugs with it. The internet has vastly increased commerce, trade and innovation; but terrorists use it to plot attacks.
So it's a question of balance and utility. Things don't get banned unless there is overwhelming evidence that they are a force for bad/evil; and/or are undermining the state/security etc. Which is the same thing.


I'm concerned with the government's balanced view and assessment, not whether something being used in an illegal manner. Bitcoin is not legal tender. Yes, you can move value around with it, but at some point (if you are going to buy anything of substance) you have to convert it in to fiat. The question is how big of a threat is it to the state?


Again, that would be illegal, but I'm concerned with the government's balanced view of the advantages and disadvantages. It may sound strange, but for instance, the drug trade does not seem to bother governments that much. Hundreds of thousands of people are employed in the drug war, prisons, law enforcement, hospitals etc. It's just a business like any other. Just because some folks don't pay some tax at some point, doesn't necessarily effect the security of the state. And if drug lords can easily (with Bitcoin) transfer their funds from around the world to invest/spend in the USA, that why would that really bother the authorities?
And note that this is NOT an example of the tragedy of the commons at all! Take a look at the definition of that a bit closer.


That is correct. And I have seen a meme to that effect!  But the authorities (esp. the tax folks) are not totally daft; and when it comes to big, illegal targets, they will soon start asking the right questions. Remember, **you** need to prove where your money has come from; the government does **not** not have to prove you got it illegally. So **you** would need to show that you had purchased computers, and when. And/or your membership of a mining pool. Then they would ask which Bitcoin addresses your mined coins were first sent to? Then which address were they transferred to after that? They can check the blockchain. They could ask you technical questions about setting up the software and how it all worked to see if you understood it. And you had an asset - did you declare that asset each year on your tax return - the year you mined them? Did you value that asset correctly as it appreciated? How come you claim you are mining in 2013 when it was so difficult then?
And of course, you would then be subject to capital gains tax at least!
Not easy eh?


Please, you have to know a bit about Bitcoin! No credit card or PayPal charges, no chargebacks, instant, global, fantastic for 3rd world countries with poor banking infrastructure, enables USA companies to sell around the world to folks with no credit cards, PayPal or banks etc etc.




Here's an **exact** example. You are based in the USA and sell water pump parts. You are happy to take credit cards and/or PayPal from the USA and Canada. But if someone orders from Uganda in Africa, or a small town in Vietnam, are you going to take their credit card or PayPal even if they had those!! NOPE. But FedEx and UPS deliver there. But are you happy to take Bitcoins? Yep. Instant and none reversible.
I could list examples all day, there are thousands. How about keeping the 2% credit card companies charge you as a merchant and the 3.9% PayPal charge you for yourself! Or give a discount to your customers for paying via Bitcoin. Business increases all round and the GDP goes up.


Exactly. Say you have $100,000 in BTC. Why not stick it with a bank, who will insure the BTC if they get stolen or lost. And they will give you interest?
I think you make some valid points, but you don't really understand how governments and organisations come to decisions. And I think you need to understand Bitcoin a bit better.

...eh, I think it's you who needs to do some of that hard stuff called "thinking".
Suppose his employer paid him via check? or bank transfer? or cash? - then what recourse would he have? Just the same as if he was paid in Bitcoin.
If your friend had complained to PayPal, then nothing would have happened, as PayPal don't care two hoots about this sort of thing. The only time they would have helped, is if he had paid for an item and the seller had no signed proof of delivery.
Paying via PayPal is throwing 3.9% of the invoice down the drain - as that is what the PayPal fee would have been. And remember, the 3.9% is on the gross total including any VAT/Sales Tax etc.
Next time your friend should be asked to be paid in Bitcoin, and request a 2% extra (thus splitting the PayPal fee). There is only a tiny fee, if any, with Bitcoin.
If your friend has a true "contract" with the company, then if he does not get paid it's easy to just start an action in the small claims court (at least in the UK).

One of the great things about Bitcoin, is that loads of folks who are "libertarians", want small government and less regulation, and want each State to be free of overall Federal regulation - suddenly come up against the reality of that. eg:
**They lose all their money at unregulated Bitcoin exchanges!**
It's the funnest thing to watch, as the mad reality of their crazy dreams hits home.
Handling millions of dollars of other folks money is a serious business, and huge hurdles need to be put in the way of anyone attempting it. You need to prove you really know what you are doing and you have large funds and long-term commitment.

I was involved in the film business a few years back, and I can say that your comments are the most accurate and concise I've every seen. Well done - you have hit the nail on the head.
Most art costs very little, if anything to produce: painting, drawing, sculpture, writing, installations. A true artist will do these things because they love to do them, and/or even feel compelled. If you are bad - no problem. If you are good - no problem, perhaps folks will pay $$$ for your work.
But with film, if your movie sucks, $$$ are just thrown down the drain. It's hard to estimate how many full length movies are made each year, just in the USA, but it could be 10,000 or more.
EVERYBODY wants to make a movie, but it's incredibly difficult to pull all the strands together, and every experienced film makers who have made wonderful movies, can often turn out a stinker.
That said, a good movie can be made for very, very little money today. Digital equipment is so cheap, and you can edit it on your Mac in your bedroom. And there are thousands of great actors who will work for peanuts as they are broke. If you are any good, your movies should shine through.

Excellent analysis.
But I'm not sure about: *FinCEN elected to define "virtual currency" - which means it very likely will find itself recognized as such in law sometime soon*
There is a good analysis of this situation here:
I am not sure it what what way Bitcoin could or would be "recognised" in law. In most of the world, something that is not illegal is legal. And I'm not sure what context it could be recognised, and what (if anything) that would mean.
But I think this is fascinating, and goes to the heart of the debate.

I have been thinking about this - governments around the world will LOVE crypto currency. Except they will make a few "tweaks":
You will be assigned an address when you are born, possible linked to your DNA signature. You will only legally be able to use this address to receive and send funds.
The government will have a master key to see all balances and extract money for taxes, fines etc. Same goes for banks, to ensure you repay loans etc.
Same goes for companies - they will have registered and designated addresses.
The blockchain will be tweaked so that funds are fully traceable around the world for eternity. No mixing or anonymous addresses.
There will be a national/international accepted protocol for crypto currencies - just like ethernet, SNMP, SIP etc. So funds can easily be exchanged and moved.
The government will be able to print money at the touch of a button.
The drug business, tax avoidance, black markets etc. will all be suppressed.
There will be no more cash.
Welcome to the future!

Simple: This is the IPO of Bitcoin. Imagine that "email" had an IPO - what do you think the price of that would be?!
IMHO the price rise is fundamentally caused by smart Silicon Valley tech investors and dot.com millionaires/billionaires who can see how big it's going to be. And they have lots of insider knowledge about all the apps and sw that is being developed for the BTC world.
Remember that FB brought Instagram for $1B. The current market cap of Bitcoin is **Nothing** to these people. There could easily be 500 of them each investing $10m **easy**. That is a market cap of $5B. Now add on all the financial folks and general investors, plus Joe public, plus those who need BTC to actually use; and you get a vast market cap.
Now the race is on: the price is going to go up and up. At the same time the practical up-take of Bitcoin is going to go up and up. The latter needs to catch-up with the former within 2 or 3 years, or it will be a bubble. Hold on to your hats!

You should buy some Bitcoins as a long-term investment; and make those coins grow by spreading the word about Bitcoin, and using Bitcoins to buy and sell with. Don't forget to ask the vendors for a small discount as there are no Credit Card or PayPal fees!
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose, and keep it a small percentage of your overall portfolio. Bitcoin is indeed highly speculative, but the upside could be huge, with Bitcoins worth $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, $100,000, who knows? If you buy 10 BTC now, and they are worth say $3,000 each in 3 years, you have done very well.

1.  Systems are already in place where you can pay in Bitcoins from a "green address". This an address which is known to be safe, and payments in Bitcoins from it can be accepted safely with no confirmations.
2.   will accept payments with no confirmations (under a certain value), and then pay the merchant direct in USD or BTC, or indeed most currencies. So solving both issues at once: time delay for confirmations and the possible variance in the exchange rates for BTC.
3.   allow you to buy almost anything worldwide with BTC.
3.  There are new mobile apps that allow you to store USD, then when you are ready to pay in BTC, convert your USD and make the payment. So again, no currency fluctuations.
So lot's of exciting stuff happening to make it all easy and quick!
But if you want to continue paying via credit card, and the gas station charging you extra for that (which happens in many parts of the world), then be my guest :-)

I made the BIG mistake of panicking a week or so ago as a saw a big dip. I sold all my BTC at an exchange with shallow market depth (=bad price), and then had to buy them all back again at the same exchange a day later (due to withdrawal limits).
Now I have learnt my lesson, and I will take the long view and ride the dips, troughs and humps.

Interesting, there has been discussion of this elsewhere. Some traders seem to think that this is not trying to create lag, rather that they are trying to make inexperienced trader think that the price is higher than it is, because such folks don't understand market depth. They see lots of orders, and they assign weight to that rather than their price.
Not sure though.

Sorry, but if you need to ask a question like this, and worse, are prepared to listen to the answers and maybe even act upon them, then you should not be investing in anything.
In order to make a good investment, you need to do a huge amount of research, often hours, days or weeks, so YOU can make a good judgement and assessment.
Every single person on this forum (well, almost) owns many many Bitcoins, and has a vested interest in the price going up. Me included! But again, most of them genuinely believe that it is a good investment - or rather they believe that Bitcoin is an excellent idea and product that will go mainstream.
So naturally, they will tell you the truth - which most of the time will be yes, invest.
What other sort of person do you expect you will find on these forums?
Try reddit.comand see what they say there!
You certainly have missed the boat to some extent. A few year ago you could have brought Bitcoins for 5 US cents. Today they hit $157 USD. That's a 3,100% increase. Unless Bitcoin hits $500,000, you will never see that again.

You should be OK. They have a GBP bank account in Japan. MTGox will charge you a fee, and your bank will do the same.
But I use this way. It's cheaper overall, and it means you trade in EUR, where the market is deeper and the prices often better:
Use  to change GBP to EUR and send via SEPA to the MTGox EUR bank account in Poland. Much, much better than using your bank, and fee is very low from MTGox. Also faster - can be next day sometimes.
Only bummer, is you need to be verified by MTGox to do a SEPA transfer.

The FinCEN guidelines are just that; they are "guidance", and not law. You can read more about it on the net. Technically, you are most likely breaking numerous laws everyday and don't realise it. eg: Gawd knows how many folks are running business on eBay and are not complying with health and safety laws in their home as a result.
In practice I doubt very, very much that the law is going to come after you dealing in Bitcoins, unless you set up a physical shop or office somewhere and start having a queue outside.

I think the OP just doesn't understand what Bitcoin is. You are just seeing it through the "lens" of your previous experience - but you need to take those glasses off.
Bitcoin is unique, because it's not a currency, stock nor investment. Rather it's some weird hybrid of all of these, PLUS (and more importantly) it has function, value and utility in its own right.
Bitcoin is to PayPal, credit cards &amp; bank transfers, as Email is to letters, faxes and FedEx. Bitcoin allows you to transfer value around the globe almost instantly and at virtually zero cost. When you purchase Bitcoins now, it's as if you are buying a share in the company that owns the rights and technology to this product.
Imagine that you could have purchased shares in "Email" years ago. Same thing.
It's so 100% totally wrong to see it as a currency, even though there are lot's of Bitcoin enthusiasts around that push that angle.
In a nutshell, this is what is happening: many folks are buying Bitcoins as a speculative investment, but one of the results in doing so, is that they will become familiar with it's usage, and appreciative of it's functions and advantages. So they will start to use it. Vendors and service providers will start to take Bitcoins to win this market segment, and thus folks will buy more Bitcoins etc. And then many folks will just buy Bitcoins because they are so useful and save themselves so much money - such as people remitting monies to their home country. This will all happen very fast, as the internet facilitates global awareness very quickly these days.
But if all this happens out-of-sync; then a huge bubble could form, and then a crash. But I think there would be a recovery.
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:32:43

Taking more than $10,000 out of the country at any one time is not banned. It's just that you have to declare it and prove you have paid tax on the income.
I agree that things are banned for economic reasons. eg: on the overall balance of the evidence, somethings are found to be detrimental to the economic well-being of the country and are thus banned.
So for instance, the pesticide DDT is banned. It is fantastically effective and killing pests and increases crop yields massively, and makes food cheaper - it's a great economic benefit at that point. But it's effect of the food chain and other wildlife ("collateral damage") is so great that it is overall considered to be of detriment to the well-being of the country, and so is banned. The chemical companies lobbied hard to keep DDT, but the government said no.
Kodak was worth $31 billion 15 years ago. Then came the onslaught of digital cameras and systems. Did Kodak manage to lobby the US government to declare digital camera illegal? Nope. Now Kodak is bankrupt.
Did the USPS manage to get emailed banned? Or taxed? Nope.


Operating a cab is not banned, it's just that you have to get a permit. Government tend to regulate things and tax them. Same will go for Bitcoin.


As I have pointed out before, it's not as easy as you make-out. If you are a drug lord with $50 million (small change to those guys), you will have to convert that in to bitcoin at one-end, and then back to the local currency at the other. Hard to do on the street I would imagine, you need an exchange, who are already regulated by the US gov. and must conform with AML regs.
Plus, where do you think the investment money from drug productions ends up? It ends up in the USA and is invested in legitimate business that pay tax etc. Do you think that the proceeds from the sale of Afghan heroin are "invested" in businesses in Afghanistan? Or do you think the proceeds are invested in stable countries like the USA that give good, solid, high returns? 
Once again, a balanced view has to be taken. Why is US cash not banned? That is used by drug lords is it not? Why are international bank transfers banned? They are used by drug lords and tax-evaders are they not?: Because their positive aspects outweigh their negative.


I'm a rational, thinking human being, who knows people personally in government, including politicians and civil servants. It's possible to study the decision-making process of governments and other entities with power, and deduce their modus operandi.
Elected officials want to stay that way (elected), and one of the ways they can ensure that is to bring continued wealth and financial stability to the electorate; whilst ensuring that they and their cronies rake off big sums for themselves. So as I have said above, they balance good and bad to come to an overall decision. Just because something may be used for illegal purposes, does not automatically mean that it will be banned. That is just silly. Think of: guns (murder), cash (drug deals), bank accounts (laundering money), credit cards (fraud), internet (child porn), cars (bank robbery escapes).


This is not the broken window fallacy. This is the 2nd time you have used a wrong analogy. Drugs are produced and sold to folks who want to use them, because they get pleasure from it (even if they are addicts). So it's just a business like any other.


Yep. That's right. And most of it is privatised to their crony friends, who make millions off it. That's why they have no real incentive to stop it.


True. And that's a good reason to legalise it!


The worldwide drug trade was $321.6 billion USD in 2003. That's about 1% of total global commerce. That business in not run by a couple of dealers in Harlem my friend!
The drug trade has society and human costs; but economy-wise, it's very profitable and good business. Indeed, it may have saved the banks from collapse:
*In December 2009, the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Antonio Maria Costa, claimed that illegal drug money saved the banking industry from collapse. He claimed he had seen evidence that the proceeds of organised crime were "the only liquid investment capital" available to some banks on the brink of collapse during 2008. He said that a majority of the US$352bn (£216bn) of drugs profits was absorbed into the economic system as a result. "In many instances, the money from drugs was the only liquid investment capital. In the second half of 2008, liquidity was the banking system's main problem and hence liquid capital became an important factor...Inter-bank loans were funded by money that originated from the drugs trade and other illegal activities... There were signs that some banks were rescued that way".*

Buying BTC: the scammers descend on anyone selling BTC via PayPal, so your account will get shut down.
In general: they are a slow-moving corporate monolith now, so they most likely have not heard of it, or think it's cute. As far as the average buyer of stuff on the internet is concerned, PayPal is good, because they are (much of the time) covered if the seller is a scam artist. Also, the customers doesn't really grasp that they are giving up to 4.9% of their money to PayPal in fees.
So two things will have to happen for Bitcoin to get bigger and threaten PayPal: 
1. Sellers need to start giving discounts to Bitcoin users. So: "buy with Bitcoin and get a 2% discount!". Or "buy with Bitcoin and get instant 2% cash back!" This will totally win the public over to Bitcoin.
2. Reliable and trusted escrow services need to become available using the Bitcoin escrow code that already exists. This is very clever, and you can read about it elsewhere on the web.

SEPA is only for EUR to EUR transfers (I am pretty sure). Which means you would need a UK EUR bank account - which is possible if you ask your bank. Transferwise are fantastic, but you can only transfer funds from your bank account to another bank account - not the other way around.

You would not need notes.
You would start a "Bitcoin Bank" with a capital of say 100BTC. You would lend out 80BTC at an interest rate of say 15%. Leaving you with 20%/20BTC capital.
Now you put a sign on your bank offering a savings rate of 7% for BTC. Then 80BTC you lent out would then come back to you as a savings deposit. (After the person you lent it to had paid it to someone for something - such as a van for their business).
Now you can lend out 80% of that 80BTC again, and so on and so on. You always need to keep 20% as capital - for when a saver turns-up at the bank to take their savings out.
That my friends is how the world turns, and it's called fractional reserve banking.
There are three problems:
1.  Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, so it get's more valuable (in it's own right) over time, as there is a limited supply. So the person who borrowed the 80BTC is going to find it harder and harder to earn that BTC back PLUS the interest they owe.
2.  The money supply is fixed, and so where is the interest going to come from?
3.  What happens if there is a bank run and all the depositors turn up at the same time to take their money out. No FED to bail you then eh?
That's why capitalism needs inflation and the FED to constantly put more money into the system. Plus the FED needs to be the "lender of last resort".
Which is why (or one of the reasons why) BTC will never be a threat to the dollar.
But BTC is great for many other things.
Here endith the lesson.

Related to your question:
I'm not an expert at all. But I think that if you back-up your wallet.dat file, and then move a copy of it somewhere, and then encrypt your current wallet.dat, not only will all of your previous wallet.dat files be valid, but THEY WILL NOT NEED A PASSWORD TO ACCESS THEM. Folks have been caught out this way big time and lost all their BTC as a hacker has found an old, unencrypted copy on the HD somewhere.
PLUS - and some other kind more experienced poster will explain this better - your wallet will have had 100 address at it's creation, and if you use more than this and try and go back to a backup before you used the 100 addresses, you will lose all your addresses over the 100 and thus the BTC associated with them.
Bottom line:
Alway encrypt your wallet.dat file with a very strong password indeed - long and complex. Because if a hacker gets hold of it they can run a dictionary attack day and night and may crack it.
Backup your wallet regularly, not only to your HD, but also to an external HD, and consider using Armory to make paper wallets.
If you have EVER made a copy of your wallet to your HD (or anywhere else) without a good, strong, password; then ensure you delete it with a security app.
Check that there is no key logger on your computer or other app that could mean a hacker is watching you enter your password!

Folks will only really buy with Bitcoin for three reasons:
1.  They are trying to evade tax etc., and so don't want to change their BTC into USD/GBP/EUR
2.  It's cheaper then paying in USD/GBP/EUR with a CC/PayPal.
3.  It's easier, or only possible in BTC. eg: you live in Africa and want to buy a part for your water pump from USA. The seller will not accept CC/PayPal etc due to fraud.
So unless your sales offer one or more of these advantages, you are unlikely to get any takers.
And there is ZERO point in listing BTC prices. What will work is this:
You have a website selling stuff. Folks can pay with a CC/PayPal. Your prices are very low - if not the lowest on the web - and folks are buying regularly in USD/GBP/EUR. You list your prices in those currencies.
Now you put a button on your website: "Pay with Bitcoin and save 1.5%". Or "Pay with Bitcoin and get instant 1.5% Bitcoin cash back". You can afford to do this as you are not paying the CC or PayPal fees (which can be 3.4%!!). If they buy in BTC, you give them the latest rate at MTGOX.
NOW folks will sit-up and pay attention!
But if you are just listing stuff for sale in BTC in the vain hope that that will make folks buy - you are barking up the wrong tree.

Interesting, as I know a bit about this. The worldwide total for "remittances" (folks sending money back home) is around $500B per year.
If you use a current system - bank transfer, Western Union etc.; it can take a few days, you will get hit with fees, you will get a bad exchange rate AND that bad exchange rate will be based on the bad official exchange rate!
Plus the receiver may have to visit a special shop or bank to receive their money - they may travel miles.
But if you use Bitcoins, your transfer will happen instantly, and the fees will be almost zero. Then you just change your Bitcoins for the local currency with a street dealer - and you will get an excellent, unofficial rate.
Just see how many dealers there are in India all ready!
But of course your family/friend in India could just keep them and start to spend them directly in India.
Now not only that, but there is a huge demand for folks who want to BUY Bitcoins in India, so they can transfer their funds outside to a foreign country and avoid transfer restrictions and MLR etc. Or because they just want to invest in Bitcoins. So the rate you will get for your Bitcoins will be even better, because they are a commodity.
WOW! Bitcoin is going to take over the world!

Correct. e-gold became a cess-pit of fraud and money laundering, with hardly any positive upside. If Bitcoin ends up in the same place, it will be shut down. I agree.


I can tell you have never been the subject of an IRS tax investigation :-) You are naive about the powers of the government. When it comes to collecting taxes they are ruthless, and silly excuses like you put forward would be swept aside.


This is enough for the IRS and/or the FEDS I assure you. Technically, your bitcoins are a foreign asset, as the blockchain is held on foreign computers.


My 32 companies have filed tax returns in 11 international jurisdictions. I personally pay taxes in 3 different countries!!


Bitcoin can increase GDP by facilitating frictionless transfer of value/money. It makes it easier and quicker to do business. Overall, it (may) be of benefit to the economy. Bitcoin is just a technological advance, like the internet, email, Skype, digital photography, e-commerce etc.
It thus increases productivity and trade, which increase the tax revenue whilst keeping the tax percentage the same. This keeps the government, their cronies and the electorate happy.


The exact opposite is true.
I can tell you have never run a business, let alone one exporting from the USA! And it's obvious you've never had a chargeback from a credit card or PayPal! Read a bit about Africa for example. How many people have credit cards? PayPal does not even operate in most of Africa. How many people even have a bank account? Or are near a bank? You need to start living in the real world my friend.
Have you any idea how much fraud emanates from Africa and other countries? Bitcoin is instant and non-reversible.
Getting stuff there is not the issue. Just take a look at  for starters, they ship to almost every country in the world.


Perfect sense. You could pay a small fee to the bank, just like you pay to insure your home.


When you deposit your fiat in a bank, you are not giving them your money to look after. You are investing in the bank as a business. If it goes bust, you could lose all you money. Take a look at what has happened in Cyprus.
And why **on earth** do you believe or trust the government to keep their word you silly thing. They may **say** that you are insured, but they can change their mind.
If Bitcoin becomes more stable that fiat currencies, then folks may well find it preferable to keep at least some of their wealth in Bitcoins, and thus they will want to earn interest on it.
So overall, I think you ask some good questions. But I think you knowledge and understanding of economics, business, human behaviour, the structure and behaviour of governments and people in power, is limited.
I suspect you have little experience of real life, and you are not in a position or job of power or any real importance. You most likely spend far too much time on the internet reading about conspiracies and how evil everyone is apart from yourself.
I suggest you study the above subjects more closely, and maybe do some international travel for a few months to broaden your horizons.
That's all from me on this subject! I have to get back to the real world of running my businesses.

Bitcoin is unique, because it's not a currency, stock nor investment. Rather it's some weird hybrid of all of these, PLUS it has function, value and utility in its own right.
In a nutshell, this is what is happening: many folks are buying Bitcoins as a speculative investment, but one of the results in doing so, is that they will become familiar with it's usage, and appreciative of it's functions and advantages. So they will start to use it. Vendors and service providers will start to take Bitcoins to win this market segment, and thus folks will buy more Bitcoins etc. And then many folks will just buy Bitcoins because they are so useful and save themselves so much money - such as people remitting monies to their home country. This will all happen very fast, as the internet facilitates global awareness very quickly these days.
But if all this happens out-of-sync; then a huge bubble could form, and then a crash. But I think there would be a recovery.
Buying Bitcoins for investment/speculation is just like gambling: you need to look at the odds of the event happening, and then the odds you are being offered. My thinking is something like this:
You can buy a Bitcoin now for say $100. I think that there is a 75% chance (3 in 4) chance that Bitcoin will take off massively, and that in say 18 months that Bitcoin will be worth say $5,000. So the odds the "house" is offering me are: 5,000:100 or 50:1. And the chance of it happening is 3:4. Any gambler would JUMP at such odds - and that's what I am doing.
I am pretty sure that todays value is a total give-away, and that in years to come folks will be in awe that you could have purchased a Bitcoin for only $100. Indeed I think the price for one Bitcoin could reach $100,000 or even $1M.
So the main reason I am putting my money into Bitcoin (no more than I can afford to loose), is that I think the upside could easily be so huge.
But "fool-proof"? Absolutely not. But will that stop fools investing? Nope.

This is how I would imagine they would do it if they had any sense - which a lot of them don't.
What you see in your account, and how all the trading is done, is just a big database, and no money or BTC get's moved around.
The BTC cold wallets are held on a pristine PC that have never been on the web and never will be.
All incoming BTC payments go straight to the cold wallet.
Then they would schedule batch of outgoing BTC payments every two hours say. They would create all the payments in on batch, and put them onto a USB, stick that in the cold wallet PC and sign the payments. The back on the live PC to process them.

Good point! What I think is significant though, is that Bitcoin is a protocol and not really just a single app or idea. It's more like email for money. Or the concept of digital photography. So it's a new ecosystem, with so much possibility - that could spawn a whole new world of apps, web ideas, hardware &amp; software. It could revolutionise finance &amp; money transfer in many ways.
So when a large part of the tech community start to see the possibility and put hard cash in, I think that's significant.

I don't think what is happening is alarming at all. The smart folk - Silicon Valley tech investors etc., can see that Bitcoin is going to be huge. They see all the advantages, and the have insider info on all the apps and sw that is being developed. Plus you have some smart financial folk who can also see the potential, and are just treating the whole thing like an IPO.
On the other side you have lots of (relatively) young people who are mainly male and have no really financial or investing experience. They have made a very large amount of money indeed from mining or buying BTC when they were cheap. They want to cash in now, at least in part. Plus they are frightened they are going to loose out with a big crash.
Also, there is a very limited supply of BTC on the markets.
All this makes for a very volatile mix, with wild price swings. Simple as that.
But the price, overall, will keep going up for a long, long time.

What they say is true. The hackers were able to access the *encrypted* private keys and the user password *hints*.
If you follow **standard, basic** internet security, you would have used a very long and complex password that cannot be cracked with a dictionary attack (the only way of cracking such passwords). Plus, you would never have used a password hint, as your password should have been so complex that you could not have a hint for it.
And what on earth made you think that your Bitcoins would be safe with an online wallet? I mean your EUR, GBP and USD are not even safe in a bank!
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:13:13
I think it's pretty simple. Thousand of mainly young, techie type men, have millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins they have mined or purchased. Suddenly they are faced with great wealth, and are worried, excited, shocked, panicked etc.
They have no experience in trading currencies, stock or shares. The price is going up and up. Then down and down. They have already suffered one crash a couple of years ago.
So in staccato fashion, different volumes of Bitcoins flood the market when it's either going too well, or going too bad, or even just ticking along.
Then on the other side, there a group of speculators/investors, who don't really understand Bitcoin, but they are seeing an opportunity to make a lot of money. So they too see the market going up and up and down and down, and the grab anything they can, and almost any price.
Then there are a few sharks hanging around, jumping in to make money on the spreads and by arbitrage. And a lot of bots posting hundreds of small bets to try and manipulate the market.
Result: a graph that looks like a roller-coaster ride: which is exactly what it is.

*"Confidential, secure, and instant money transactions make things such as tax evasion, money laundering, and large illegal transactions more difficult to police"*
When you transfer bitcoins you are not transferring money [USD/EUR/GBP]. You have to convert money to bitcoins and vice-versa. For large amounts, this can only be done at an exchange, and they are easy to police and ensure they are using anti-money laundering IDs and procedures.
If you don't use an exchange, then you are left with dealing in large amounts of cash as always. And Bitcoin is not 100% confidential, especially at the exchange points.
In any event, most tax evasion &amp; avoidance is done via clever accounting and offshore bank accounts etc. It involves large banks and corporations - nothing to do with Bitcoin. And remember, that tax evasion it itself does not damage the economy or business as such; it just means that the government has to make-up the tax elsewhere. In the EU we have sales tax (VAT) at 20%, and this together with other taxes at the point of sale (insurance, air travel etc) effectively taxes previously untaxed income.
Moving value with Bitcoin is not money laundering. Money laundering is disguising the origin of the money, so you have a viable reason for holding the money and assets you do. Most tax evaders are caught because they have 4 houses, a large boat, 10 cars etc., but they cannot prove that they received their funds legally. This is why for instance drug lords like to invest in very expensive clubs and bars. They can claim that they have received vast amounts of cash for drinks and entrance fees, and that is how they came up with their wealth.
Countries with good, free markets and a healthy capitalism based economy do not fear movements of large sums of money in and out of their countries. It's countries with bad economies that want to impose capital controls. So the USA would be very happy to have folks from around the world moving funds to the USA - no matter how they do it, bitcoin included.
And by far the majority of companies and people do not involve themselves in day-to-day tax evasion at any scale. They could and do take cash, but most of this is declared. Most folks are honest and don't want the hassle. Using bitcoin is no different, it's just like taking a foreign currency.
*"Governments currently have the power to regulate their own currencies as they see fit, which isn't possible if they cede control to Bitcoin".*
Government control - both political and economic - is rooted in the requirement to pay taxes in legal tender. Whatever happens with Bitcoin, you will still have to pay your taxes in USD/EUR/GPB. And government bonds will always be issued in fiat. And the government will always pay its workers in fiat. Same goes for the banks; if you want to borrow $50m to open 5 new power stations, they are not going to lend you the money in Bitcoin!
So the idea that Bitcoin is somehow going to challenge existing currencies is just a non-starter IMHO.
*"Banks, which also stand to lose a lot of financial control, have a lot of political sway"*
That's true. But they are not omnipotent. And governments are not totally daft, despite them doing a very good impression of it! If Bitcoin gets big, it will be really helping the economy in many ways. And the banks will just jump on board: Folks will want secure, insured storage and apps for their bitcoin. They will want their bitcoin to be lent out so they can gain interest. Good, effective and secure exchanges are required etc. etc.
Remember, that bank don't really make that much money, if any, from ordinary folks and small businesses having bank accounts. It's a small slice of their income. And bank transfer fees are not some huge income generator. Overall, they will see more business, not less, with Bitcoin.
*"There's a lot of tax revenue and control threatened by Bitcoin"*
I don't think that's true for the reasons I've outlined.
What I think **will** happen, is that governments will think that crypto-currencies are a great idea, and over time will convert USD/EUR/GBP to crypto-currency, with no cash etc.
Here's why: every key will have to be registered with a person or company. The government will hold a master key. So now they can see all the money you have! And they can use their master key to go into your "wallet" and take out money for tax, fines etc. The will be able to track all transactions and see where all the crooks and tax evaders are. And measuring and control the money supply, money velocity, etc. will be easy. No more printing and handling cash, and moving and storing value will be so much easier.
That my friends, is the fate of this Bitcoin project! You think you are loosing your chains; but you are simply making a noose for your own necks.
**TL;DNR:** Don't worry, be happy!

I can comment on num 3, as I live in the UK and know lots of financial and banking folks. I can assure you that they hardly know anything about Bitcoin, and if they do, they just think it's a silly Ponzi scheme. And I think the idea that Bitcoin could ever threaten the banks or a sovereign currency is just silly.
If you have lived in "Bitcoin land" for too long (e.g.: Reddit &amp; the Bitcoin Forum), then you are just living in a giant echo chamber, and all you think, eat and breathe is Bitcoin. Do you really think the banks give a s**t? Or even really know Bitcoin "exists"?
The reason that the UK banks have stopped transfers to the Bitcoin exchanges, is because there has been for years, and still is, rampant fraud with UK bank accounts. Numerous accounts are hacked, bank accounts are set-up just to apply for loans with fraudulent documentation, and fraudulent applications are made for social security and tax rebates. And there are many, many scams on eBay and via email. ALL these scams need a bank account to transfer the funds into; and then from there to transfer abroad or take cash out.
The result is this: if any UK bank account is used, or suspected of being used, by a scammer, they shut the account down, no questions asked and no appeal. This is partly because the banks are forced to reinstate any customer loses by the consumer protection rules.
And there is no way they are going to make an "announcement". They don't know or care what you are up to - only that your account was used for fraud.
And don't even get me started on how heavy they are with money laundering rules.
Now how many times do you think that a scammer has tried to move funds, or trick someone into moving funds, into a Bitcoin exchange UK bank account, so they can then get their hands on Bitcoins??? **That's** why the accounts have been shut down.
Actually, there is a really easy way to transfer funds from the UK to MTGOX et al: that is to use a service like  They will convert your GBP into EUR at at market rate, and they charge either nothing or a small fee. That means you are doing a SEPA transfer which is very quick; and you can trade in EUR where the market is much deeper than GBP. So quick, cheap and you get a better rate at MTGOX!
I have done this numerous times, and they have told me they have transferred hundreds of thousands of GBP to MTGOX. If you want to transfer more than a certain amount, then they want AML ID. And you can even pay with a debit card up to £3K.
So please don't come-up with this conspiracy stuff. It's just silly. But thanks for an interesting article.

You are absolutely right to be super-cautious. Remember - just because you are paranoid it doesn't mean that they're not out to get you.
I am a Mac user. You are so much safer than on a Windows machine. But I utilise all of the following:
Install anti-virus on your Mac. Update the database and run it on your whole Mac. It's not perfect, but better than nothing.
Use Little Snitch to check that there is no key logger or such spying on you:
Create strong passwords here. A really good read!
Use Armory - the best BTC wallet. You can make paper wallets and import keys amongst many other things:
You can create off-line keys here:
There is a Mac version coming soon:
Good info here:
For *uc* sake don't use an online wallet. And whip your BTC out of the exchanges the minute they land in your exchange's wallet.
Make sure you backup your wallet.dat encrypted file to a USB and store that OFF SITE. Make paper wallets and store them in a safe or such like.
If you backup your wallet.dat file without a password, and then use a password and don't delete (securely) your backup, if someone finds that backup they can access all your keys! Same goes for when you change your password; if there is a backup around with a un secure password that could be a disaster.
Many clients have issues once you use over 100 address, the backup will NOT contain those address once you go over 100 - so you must backup when that happens. Armory does not have that problem as it saves a key for your whole wallet and every key it will ever produce. UNLESS you import a key, it which case you must back that up separately. But please read the Armoury help file about all this - I AM NOT an expert.
Please use a cold wallet for long term storage. Don't use brain wallets unless you REALLY know what you are doing.
Good luck! Or rather don't rely on luck at all :-)

There is a fair amount of fraud that goes on with PayPal - hackers getting usernames and passwords and taking over accounts. There are sites on the dark net that sell these etc. If there is ONE thing that these hackers would like to do, it's the ability to transfer the funds from those PayPal accounts to Bitcoin so they can run off with the money, and it's all untraceable!
If they couldn't do this, then they have to buy stuff and have it shipped to them; or have funds sent to another PayPal account (which all now have to be validated with a credit card etc). This is a pain for them.
So this is why PayPal limit what you can do with they system. They basically don't like you selling stuff that is: valuable, easily transportable, can be sent over the internet, small etc. Because this stuff attracts the hackers.
There have been so many cases of hackers using stolen PayPal accounts to buy BTC, that it's understandable that PayPal have stopped this. Same goes for sellers on eBay offering payment by BTC - it's so often used for fraud.

This is exactly how I have been doing it for a few weeks. I have been using MTGOX and Bitcoin-Central.
The only thing that I would point-out is that your are converting GBP &gt; EUR &gt; USD. This is not very efficient, and I have been sending EUR to MTGOX with a SEPA transfer and they have got in next day sometimes.
Of course you need account for exchange fees, deposit/withdrawal fees, and market depth. eg: I use MTGOX because I have been buying quite a few coins, and that is the best deal for me.
If you click on my invite link, you will get your first transfer FREE, which is mostly likely better than the £5 from QuidCo. PLUS if 3 folks sign-up I get £50 and in the spirit of Bitcoin-Love I will send you £10 in BTC :-)

Why is Bitcoin any threat to "the government"? It will decrease the cost of doing business and encourage international trade. A huge IT business will grow-up around it. Foreigners will find it easy to get their money out of rubbish countries and into the USA to invest. Plus it will allow folks in suppressive states to purchase virtual goods to help them fight their dictators. eg: Wordpress add ons.
Don't forget that the TOR network was indirectly funded by the US government to enable internet freedom.
Taxes will still be collected in USD. Banks will still issue vast loans in USD and take big pay-packets. The FED will continue to print money.
Bitcoin will most likely INCREASE the tax take of the US government; and in no time at all you will start to see the banks and others jumping on the bandwagon and opening Bitcoin exchanges and "safe" wallets etc.
Don't worry.

errr... well why are MTGOX doing it then? As I keep asking you. 
I transferred a large amount to MTGOX last week, and how the Bitcoins are sitting in my (cold) wallet. That is the third time I have done that, and I have an email from MTGOX saying that they have accepted many deposits from Transferwise and that confirms with MLR; and I have a second email from Transferwise saying the same thing.
MLR regulations require you to "know your client" and to ensure that there is a clear and identifiable financial trail. e.g.: where did the money come from exactly and where is it going. If the money is coming from a FSA and HMRC licensed money transfer agent such as Transferwise, who have required my photo ID, evidence of address, and a bank account that matches my name on those items; AND Transferwise ONLY accept my funds from that bank account, AND MTGOX have that same ID and evidence of address, AND Trasferwise append my transfer reference number with the same name that I have registered with MTGOX, then that my friend, is an acceptable financial trail.
Why would I want to read their TOS? Their TOS may say they will only do one thing, but there is nothing to stop the company actually doing something else. I may have a TOS saying I only serve coffee to men wearing red coats, but that does not stop me serving coffee to men in brown coats.

Transferring your USD from USA to your mum in India in INR (Rupees):
Western Union: go to local WU office, or via internet. Transfer cash/funds. They will charge you a big fee, give you the (bad) official exchange rate - and then make that exchange rate even worse!
You mum will have to go to the Western Union office to collect, show ID etc.
Bitcoin: Transfer USD funds to exchange for BTC. In-country bank transfer normally free. 0.5% exchange fee. This fee will come down a great deal over time. Send BTC to your mum in India in an instant for like 5 cents.
You mum looks at  and finds a local trader. She gets a much, much, much, better rate than WU, or even her government would give her. And no fee.
As time goes one, the BTC exchange rate will become stable (or at least slowly go up over time). So now folks are keeping their BTC and using them to buy stuff with, so no need to exchange for local currency at either end.
You will certainly find that in many African and Asian countries folks will use BTC for local biz, and their currency is so bad.

By trading, do you mean day trading? eg: you dip in and out of the market, buying and selling depending on whether you think the price will go up or down that day, hour, minute?
If that's what you mean, then I would not do that. There are many professional day-traders on MTGOX in particular. These guys work in the financial markets, and are making a killing manipulating the price on a short-term basis. Lots of amateurs are playing the Bitcoin market, and these **professionals** know what they are doing and clean up with them.
There are even hundreds of trading robots on the exchanges. Look at this one, and they even say how many robots are online at anyone time! These robots act lightning fast, and use clever algorithms to make $$$. *YOUR* $$$
But if you mean should you buy some Bitcoins as a long-term investment, as part of a balanced portfolio, and not put in more than you can afford to loose. Then **YES**. Go ahead.
I think the Bitcoin market will do one of these things:
1. Keep rising fast, possibly for 2 or 3 years. The Bitcoin currency will be well-established by then. Then there will be a big crash with all the crazy speculation. But it will recover (to its true value, which will be below the peak), as folks need Bitcoins to conduct business and transfer value worldwide instantly at no cost. Bitcoins will become part of the global internet landscape.
  Note that folks are saying *it's a bubble*. But bubbles often last years, and this has only started. eg: 1st internet tech bubble; the property bubble. Heck, even the Tulip bubble lasted 2.5 years!
2.  As above, but there is never a crash.
3.  There will be a huge bubble that will last say 6 months, then it will crash and Bitcoin will disappear.
What I don't think will happen: Bitcoin will just go up and down and cruise along for a couple of years with a small steady gentle upward slope of the graph.
My bet is on num 1. 
...or maybe num 2.
...could be num 3.
I would buy right now, the max you want to invest. But don't buy at the top of the crazy upswing we have seen in the last couple of days. Today is a good, steady price.
Good luck!

This is great news - especially when the TV gold pundits say forget Bitcoin and buy gold. At least we can say you can buy the gold with Bitcoins!
A couple of points: 
You charge a 1.021% processing fee for Bitcoin. Maybe you are using Bitpay or such like? Why not just do the exchange to USD yourselves each day? One of the beauties of Bitcoin is that it should cost so little to use - then you could say there was a zero fee.
Also you give a clearing time of 1 Business Day for Bitcoin. But you could change that to say 1 hour (if a transaction fee is paid).
On the plus side, Bitcoin allows folks to purchase unlimited amounts, which is great
I'm just pointing all this out, because folks will be attracted to buy from you because they can pay by Bitcoin, but this really needs to have lots of advantages for them so they sit-up and pay attention.
So your "Type of Payment" listing should say:
Amount: Any
Processing Fee: No
Clearing Time: 1 business hour
That would make Bitcoin top dog for every buyer!

This is why bank accounts are shut down that are linked to Bitcoin exchanges. It's certainly why it's happen in the UK:
Imagine you are a hacker, and have access to hacked bank accounts, or you have brought a list of such accounts. You need to transfer the funds somewhere right? To which account? It's tricky. You may open an account yourself; but you need ID, and the banks in the EU are very strict. You transfer the funds, and then go to collect the cash - the police may be waiting for you.
You may withdraw via ATM, but the bank account owner will have been alerted by then and the money frozen. You could do a foreign transfer, but this will often alert the bank's anti-fraud system, and the owner will be called for confirmation.
So you transfer the funds to a Bitcoin exchange bank account.
Imagine you are doing this common eBay scam - you buy say a car at a high price. You do a bank transfer and add an extra £500. You tell the seller this is for the transport of the car to Morocco say. You ask them to pay it direct to the transport company bank account - which is actually a Bitcoin exchange bank account. A week after this happens, the original purchase transfer is cancelled and a chargeback applied to the sellers bank account.
Now most of the exchanges don't have any AML (anti money laundering) requirements etc. So how many fraudsters targeted their bank accounts do you think?
In the UK, you only need to have ONE fraudster target your bank account ONCE and the banks will freeze your account instantly, no questions asked.
And don't forget, that financial institutions around the world are subject to very strict AML laws. If they see large sums of money going from ordinary folks bank accounts in to a local or foreign bank account, this is going to ring big alarms bells. At that point, the banks simply shut the exchanges account down. What do they care? They don't make that much money (if any profit really), by making simple transfers - and they are risking criminal charges.
This is why the accounts have been shut down. Not because the Banks don't like the idea of Bitcoin etc. They don't even have a clue what it is, and it's never going to be any real threat to them.
Note that in the UK, it's easy to transfer your funds to any Bitcoin exchange around the world using  This is a money transfer service, and it's actually cheaper than using your bank. They have done thousands of transfers to Bitcoin exchanges, and they even take debit cards!! The banks don't stop you transferring from your bank account to Transferwise, because Transferwise are more like a bank in their own right (sort-of) and not just another "bank account". Plus they may ask you for ID etc., and have anti-fraud and AML procedures.

Totally agree. This is early, early days for Bitcoin. The Bitcoin baby has only just been born today, after a gestation of 4 years. It's got many, many, many years of rapid and solid growth ahead of it. Who knows where the price may end? But one thing is for sure, in the not too distant future, folks will look back in AWE that you could have purchased a Bitcoin for "only" $100.
@_date: 2013-03-29 17:28:54
I don't think that BTC are being "dumped". Rather I think that there are many miners with tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of BTC who are now selling part of their stash to buy cars, holidays even houses.
2,000 BTC is nothing to some of these miners, but that equates to nearly half-a-million dollars at the moment. Who would not want to cash-in part of their investment and start having fun?
But just imagine if no one was selling their BTC. Then no one would be able to buy them would they? Then everyone would loose interest and there would be no liquidity in the market.
It's all basic capitalistic economics and market forces.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:59:48
There is no such thing as a dumb questions. You are smart to ask. I had to learn all this when I started as well.
Take a look at the "market depth" on the charts. You will see that folks are placing buy orders and lower, and lower prices. This is how a market works.
So if I wanted to cash out 10,000 BTC now, the top price may be say $244, but I could only sell say 2,000 BTC at that price. The next 3,000 someone would buy at $243 and so on and so on.
Here is a good chart to see market depth:
Set "group by price" at the TRHC to 10.00 to make it clearer.

 is fab. But could be overkill if all you are doing is selling BTC.
You don't need it to have BTC designated as a currency - you could just chose any currency to represent it.

Agree 100% - spot on. I thought this from the day in early 2011 I first read about Bitcoin. But did I buy any? Nope. DOH!

With Amazon, you have to first chose a payment method. eg: which credit or debit card. And then the relevant currencies are shown (if any, depending on your location and the cc types/denomination etc).
So the screen shot does not make sense, you can't use a cc to pay in BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:00:27
Totally spot-on. If I want to order say a boat engine part from the USA (I'm in the UK), I have to:
(A) Use my credit card which will give me a really bad USD/GBP exchange rate, and charge me a "fee", and the seller will get charged say 2-3%. Plus the seller will have to factor in that some percentage of their credit card transactions suffer a "chargeback" for fraudulent use. Or...
(B) I have to make an international bank transfer, and again, I will get a terrible rate and BOTH me and the seller will be charged huge "fees". PLUS my money will disappear into the banking system for at least 3 days - who get's the interest on it then?
The seller needs to just have a Bitcoin button on their website, showing that I effectively get say a 3% discount for using Bitcoin. So I'm going to use my Bitcoins aren't I?
Now what if the seller get's an order from someone in a distant foreign country know for fraud? Normally, they could never take a credit card or PayPal order. And even bank transfers can be reversed! But with Bitcoin NO PROBLEM. And remember, in Africa and many other countries, most payments are done by mobile phone systems. So it is zero hassle and just a small learning curve for them to move over to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:54:23
I don't think it will every really "stabilise" in the same way that you could say that currencies like the dollar and the euro are stable - BTC is a totally different animal.
I think you should just get used to it; and assume that the value will lie in a large range.
The best way to "stabilise" your situation and be able to stop worrying about what your BTC are worth is to sell them. The you will have the dollar/euro etc in your hand.
But of course with inflation - always understated by governments - your currency is worth less and less each day. And imagine if you are in Cypress where your euro has just lost 40% of it's value!

There was no "bubble fiasco". Any new currency such as Bitcoin is going to have a rough ride when it first starts to gain traction. And this has been said repeatedly by those closely involved with running it. It may take a few years before it settles down.

It seems that lots of countries - France included - held Dollars, and were demanding to cash them in for Gold, as promised by the USA. So they didn't actually hold Gold.
The mistake they made was trusting (hoping?) that the USA would not at all times act in it's best perceived interests. When it came down to the wire, the USA pulled the plug, knowing they could get away with it as the world economic super-power.

Ha! It's a little known fact, but in the UK (and possibly other countries), when money is transferred to your account, or you deposit a cheque, the money is **NEVER** 100% yours. Legally, the bank can come back X years later and claim that the money was fraud and take the funds back!!

Bitcoin is not really a currency or stock. Think of it more like a new technology.
Was or will there be an email bubble? Skype bubble? iPhone bubble? Twitter bubble?
As more folks buy Bitcoin, the more they will use it, and indeed the more they will demand it from suppliers and shops. And the more they will want to use it amongst themselves to move funds and pay debts.
Bitcoins have function and utility.
In any case, as you can see from articles on the web, bubbles often last years - how long did the last property bubble last? How long did the first tech bubble last?
Heck, even Tulip Mania lasted three years!

@_date: 2013-03-31 11:54:57
I have used Transferwise 3 times, and numerous folk use them to transfer to MTGOX and others. You have to supply AML docs to Transferwise, and this, together with their registration with the UK FSA and HMRC etc., means that they are an acceptable part of the "chain" from your bank account. MTGOX will accept funds from them for this reason - and so everyone is safe!
*TransferWise is registered with the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) as a fully authorized payments institution (reference 571669) which gives us a license for collecting money and for making international payments.*

Yes - it took me a while to grasp this concept. If you were on a FOREX changing $1m USD to EUR you would not really have this issue as the market is so "deep". On most of the BTC exchanges, you can see all the orders lined-up, and the running totals, so you can work-out the deal.

One of the other big benefits, is that you can accept orders from around the world. (But I accept this may not apply to you).
Example: you sell parts for water pumps. Folks in Africa and Asia would love to order from you, and UPS/Fedex have no problems delivering. But would you accept credit cards from those areas? Heck, most don't even have credit cards, let alone PayPal. How long would an international bank transfer take? Do these folks even have bank account? And even a bank transfer can be reversed (a little known fact). The bank and credit card companies will charge a big fee and give the buyer a terrible exchange rate.
But with bitcoin you can take **instant** and **irreversible** payment from anywhere and anyone on the globe - and for virtually zero fee. Now the whole world is your market.
That's bitcoin!

@_date: 2013-04-05 22:45:52
That is just illogical. You should have BTC stored away in a cold wallet for long-term investment.
Then you have your $$ spending money as normal. Now there is ZERO difference between spending that in $$ and spending it in BTC.
So just transfer you spending money into BTC and spend away. You will be increasing the value of your investment BTC, because you are driving adoption.
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:04:40
This is terrible news, and makes me start to think (unlike my earlier posts elsewhere) that there is some sort of conspiracy involving the banks against Bitcoin.
Transferwise adhere to AML rules; and so do MTGOX. So what is the problem? What else is there that they are supposed to do?
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:16:46

I would think you need to add on that many, many Silicon Valley tech investors &amp; million/billionaires must be investing because they can see the potential.

I think you're a nut :-) What on earth makes you think that "large financial organisations" care two hoots about Bitcoin. We all live in the Bitcoin echo chamber; but in the real world, it's just a silly news story.
Bitcoin has the potential to make changes to the financial landscape, but banks, credit card companies and PayPal are not going anywhere.
What is to stop PayPal using their vast network to "verify" Bitcoin users, so folks can buy from merchants using Bitcoin with confidence? Why can't PayPal buy  and charge 1% for processing? Why can't PayPal and/or the credit card companies guarantee your Bitcoin purchases for a small fee?
If Bitcoin ever becomes so big it's taken that seriously, then the banks will see your Bitcoin stash as an asset, and you will be able to borrow against it. Or you can "bank" your Bitcoins and they will pay you interest.
This will all come about!

@_date: 2013-03-31 22:26:30
I'm not sure it what way you would think they would or could adopt it? PayPal is a payment system that allows merchants (inc. eBay sellers) to take credit and debit cards easily. PayPal take a cut of each transaction, and this is how they make their money.
The other thing that PayPal offers, is a certain degree of protection for the purchaser. In certain circumstances, if the merchant does not deliver the goods, PayPal will refund the purchaser their money. This means that the merchant must be known and verified by PayPal.
It works the other way as well; if a purchase was made using a hacked or fraudulent PayPal account, the merchant may have a chargeback forced upon them.
I guess they could copy  and maybe someday they will. But in order to offer the security to folks purchasing with Bitcoins, they would have to be able to verify the merchant. They would not need to worry about the purchaser, as Bitcoin transactions are irreversible - unless someone had their Bitcoins stolen, and they were transferred to an address that was then used to purchase goods etc., then there could be trouble for the purchaser.
But none of this is any concern to them at the moment. All they are concerned about is that fraudsters are using hacked PayPal accounts to buy Bitcoins - and so they are blocking this use of PayPal.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:14:28
This is why bank accounts are shut down that are linked to Bitcoin exchanges. It's certainly why it's happen in the UK:
1.  Imagine you are a hacker, and have access to hacked bank accounts, or you have brought a list of such accounts. You need to transfer the funds somewhere right? To which account? It's tricky. You may open an account yourself; but you need ID, and the banks in the EU are very strict. You transfer the funds, and then go to collect the cash - the police may be waiting for you. 
   You may withdraw via ATM, but the bank account owner will have been alerted by then and the money frozen. You could do a foreign transfer, but this will often alert the bank's anti-fraud system, and the owner will be called for confirmation.
   So you transfer the funds to a Bitcoin exchange bank account.
2.  Imagine you are doing this common eBay scam - you buy say a car at a high price. You do a bank transfer and add an extra £500. You tell the seller this is for the transport of the car to Morocco say. You ask them to pay it direct to the transport company bank account - which is actually a Bitcoin exchange bank account. A week after this happens, the original purchase transfer is cancelled and a chargeback applied to the sellers bank account.
Now Bitcoin-24 required no evidence of your bank account or AML ID etc. So how many fraudsters targeted their bank accounts do you think?
In the UK, you only need to have ONE fraudster target your bank account ONCE and the banks will freeze your account instantly, no questions asked.
This is why the accounts have been shut down. Not because the Banks don't like the idea of Bitcoin etc. They don't even have a clue what it is.
Note that in the UK, it's easy to transfer your funds to any Bitcoin exchange around the world using  This is a money transfer service, and it's actually cheaper than using your bank. They have done thousands of transfers to Bitcoin exchanges, and they even take debit cards!! The banks don't stop you transferring from your bank account to Transferwise, because Transferwise are more like a bank in their own right (sort-of) and not just another "bank account". Plus they may ask you for ID etc., and have anti-fraud and AML procedures.

2. Don't invest in any "schemes". There is no such thing as a free lunch. You can't make money out of nothing. You can't get huge interest rates from normal business activity. They are all scams.
3.  You may not like government "regulation"; but just see what happens where there is none! Go-ahead and invest in "Bitcoin" companies, run via Tor and where you have no idea of the directors involved.
