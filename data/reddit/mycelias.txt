People are going to be hostile to this type of request for a few reasons:
* You don't have any significant clout with this sub (i.e., vs if Andreas A. or Jimmy S. were to ask)
* Your survey is rather long and there is no real incentive to complete (didn't your academic advisor suggest incentive based and time locked survey design?)
* It's not very clear how your dissertation will provide value for the folks in this community. I'm sure it's very interesting, but we need to know what info is valuable (i.e., key trends, technical developments, real world use cases etc.)
Maybe you should revise the original post

It attracts too many people who only care about the price and lambos. This distracts from the actual work done by developers.

Ah 3Blue1Brown - one of the best educational channels out there for sure.
He inspired me to create my own video essays. Love his editing and way of simplifying complex concepts.

It's important to understand the development philosophy behind Bitcoin to appreciate the perspective of others in this thread. This is not a "break things fast" type of developer mentality that you would see at let's say a Facebook or a Google.
Bitcoin needs to prioritize security and decentralization first before moving onto scalability in any meaningful manner. Pushing forward a scalability protocol that has not been thoroughly tested could lead to many bad outcomes. This includes users losing massive amounts of funds due to security loopholes and centralization of off-chain scaling solutions (i.e., spoke and hub topology on the second layer).
Patience is a virtue when it comes to pushing Bitcoin development forwards. The loops you have to jump through to get a pull request through for working Bitcoin implementation is levels beyond anything I've seen in my own dev work - they take it extremely seriously.
Don't worry, we'll get there - keep supporting the devs and learn why things are done this way.

First I suggest taking out the apologetic language - I don't think most recruiters would look at that favorably as they may interpret it as insecurity instead of humility. Second, you should be linking to your GitHub or website that shows your programming work related to blockchain and/or crypto. If you say you have programming skills, you need to demonstrate them and show what languages and technologies you are familiar with. Show, don't just tell.
You need to make it very explicit what you are good at (or kinda good at) and how your skills fit into the target company's business needs. This is where showing your portfolio would help greatly. Would also take out the language around losing $55,000 - not necessary.
I think it's fair to say that you're committed and deep interested in the field, but try to pick a niche and dive deeper on that.
Edit: thanks for the silver my dood :)

haha do you do this often?

1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis
Current USD / BTC price: $4,000 (assume)
4,000 US Dollars = (4,000 \* 100) = 400,000 US Cents
100,000,000 satoshis / 400,000 US cents = 250 satoshis / 1 US Cents
General formula would be (100,000,000) / ( (Current USD / BTC price) \* (100) ) = number of satoshis in 1 US cent
Think that should be correct...

Congrats - setting up a node is a big step forward :)
Just curious - what was your goal in setting up a full node?

Hahaha - green candle is brilliant
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:32:54
Yeah absolutely - happy to help. Good that you included your GitHub and detailed your experience. Best of luck in your recruiting!

I generally agree with your logic... for folks interested in context around the history of money and arguments for why Bitcoin is a store of value I suggest referring to Vijay Boyapati's excellent article:
It was written during the bull run in 2017, but most of his points are still cogent. Guess relevance in a bear market is one way to test quality writing.
