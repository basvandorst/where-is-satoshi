No, the definition of the word *stealing* does that for him.
Stealing - **take** (another person's property) without permission or legal right and **without intending to return it**. 
When you copy something, nothing is taken away, and returning does not apply. Hope this helps.

You're dragging fiat's convoluted over-engineered system of social contracts into a realm where they do not belong. 
Ownership does not apply on the blockchain, only access/control. Sorry if that seems pedantic but it's an important distinction. All blockchain transactions are final, permanent, non-reversible, one-way tickets. Think of it like a clock that is also a permanent public record. **You can never turn back time** without destroying the [value of the] system.
Bruce is correct, this is violence-backed extortion and little else.  The ethical imperative here is disobedience - public resistance and outrage at any violence imposed on people for **sharing information with one another**. If I read you a poem, has a transaction occurred? Because in today's world, [knowing a poem could well mean having access to a sum of wealth]( Money == Information now. Who will police such things?

The impact of centralized money printing has a velocity of propagation through the economic pipeline. This puts at a predefined competitive disadvantage entities that are furthest away from the center of the money supply. The centralized printing discriminates with a higher burden those who are further away from the center of the money supply on the chain of economic activity. One must wonder: “Is this a designed feature, or is it an unintended economic consequence?”
When comparing the central bank driven system with a decentralized cryptocurrency alternative, it becomes apparent that centralized system sets the framework where the order of access to freshly printed cash in the chain of economic activities make significant, if not primary, the difference in the formula of competitive advantage. Businesses with a spot “closest to the king” get rewarded with greater economic rents. The last spot in the order carries the full burden of devaluation.
This becomes an especially detrimental trend over a statistically significant period of time. The competition for creating better economic value eventually gets replaced with the competition for the “seat higher up on the ladder.” Direct evidence of this is the latest surge of crony-capitalism business models in all corners of the world.
The decentralized principle of Bitcoin is poised to end this advantage and restore equilibrium to market relationships with its re-emphasis on value creation. When the shift to a decentralized cryptocurrency network gains critical mass, the hierarchical order of access to cash will be replaced with the principles of a mesh network and thus, reflects the principles of social and democratic co-existence to a far greater degree.
This change will trigger the transformation of the socio-economic structure of society in many ways – some aspects of this change are difficult to envision.

People who are thinking of fiat &lt;-&gt; crypto exchange rates as a way to measure Bitcoin in terms of fiat wealth have made a fundamental mistake in crafting their mental model for what is happening here.
 The exchange rate is a measure of how quickly or slowly the river of fiat wealth is melting into the blockchain's event horizon at any given time.

Okay Let's get something straight: *there is no Nobel Prize for economics!* The five real Nobel Prizes—physics, chemistry, literature, peace, and medicine/physiology—were set up in the will left by the dynamite magnate when he died in 1895. 
By contrast, **the economics "prize" was created by Sweden’s Central Bank in 1969, nearly 75 years later.** The award’s real name is the “*Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel*.” It was not established by Nobel, but supposedly in memory of Nobel. 
Getting back to Bitcoin, it is Computer Science in the first place, and this field is much closer to pure mathematics and therefore much closer to objective measurable truth. **Truth** is ultimately the source of Bitcoin's power to change our world.
Those claiming Bitcoin is economics are unintentionally slandering Bitcoin.

Creator of Litecoin is smart enough to know it's a reinvention of wthe wheel: Earth only needs one immutable tamper-proof global public ledger and that's Bitcoin. Litecoin has marketed itself cleverly, riding on the 'environmentally-friendly' cheap bullshit trend that corporations have spent the past two decades abusing to make idiots feel good about doing basically nothing but brand themselves green.
Litecoin's entire value is premised on the fallacious implication that Bitcoin (heavy coin) is somehow environmentally unfriendly. Mass Bitcoin adoption would in fact represent a massive reduction in greenhouse gas production, since the sunset of traditional fiat scrip means no more armored trucks moving cash all over the place. That alone more than makes up for whatever megawatts the network eats.
Storing wealth on the Litecoin network is tantamount to paying $2.50 for bottled water at a Starbucks in NYC, even though NYC tap water is among the best in the nation and Starbucks will provide it to you free (with ice) if you ask.

I'm saying Bitcoin's economics are little more than an emergent property of Bitcoin's computer science (mathematics). [Read Satoshi's whitepaper]( then compare it to any written economic theory. You will quickly notice the telltales of real science here: clear and concise explanations of mechanics and functions, and the presence of robust mathematics.
I'm saying Bitcoin is an organism built of the purest/hardest of the sciences, rather than an organism evolved from one of the least pure/softest sciences (economic theories).
@_date: 2015-06-19 15:53:01


This is your "immutable law" of economics? You make my point for me. One wouldn't have to search far to find examples of situations where demand grows and supply doesn't, but price does not rise. 
Food, shelter, and healthcare in many nations around the globe have price caps that work to mute this unmutable economic "law" of yours.
Bitcoin is a useful and valuable public ledger because the blockchain [decentralized mathematics] is not subject to the whims of governments or any other central authority. *Crypto is the only realm in which economics can be truly scientific.* Fiat money sails by the winds of politics, these can never be accounted for in a mathematical model designed to predict future events. By contrast Bitcoin swims deep in the ocean of mathematical truth, and is hardened by the "water pressure" at this depth.

4. If there was a bug that could potentially destroy bitcoin in this way it would've been discovered by now. Only 31,000 lines of code, it's been 5 years. Even if this happened, bitcoin can be rolled back and patched. It's software, it's organic and adaptive (see TED talk linked above).
5. I'd be interested in hearing an elaboration on "economic reasons" could make bitcoin unfeasible. Only a catastrophic collapse of capitalism seems even remotely possible at this juncture, which would fall into this category. We'll have much bigger worries than crypto if that's coming, though. Like food and water.
6. If he's been buying for two years, it's very possible that he bought many/most of his coins for half of what they are worth today. Remember two years is before the China spike happened. Ergo, coin liquidation would still represent net gain over the two years.

"Nationalism is our form of incest, is our idolatry, is our insanity. "Patriotism" is its cult. It should hardly be necessary to say, that by "patriotism” I mean that attitude which puts the own nation above humanity, above the principles of truth and justice; not the loving interest in one’s own nation, which is the concern with the nation’s spiritual as much as with its material welfare — never with its power over other nations.

That's correct. A lot of people don't understand how early we are in this transition still. Remember, Coinbase is a company that does business transactions directly to your BANK. Coinbase is an exception in that regard, they have been given special permissions and trust by the bankers. These people are not oblivious to the bitcoin witchhunts going on in the halls of power right now. We all saw what happened to Charlie Shrem. 
Nobody wants to be made an example of. They're being obedient as fuck so they can keep their profits. Don't worry, this will change in time as the bitcoin ecosystem matures. Because with that maturation, power will continue to devolve from the state down to the individual. 
Eventually no one will give a fuck what Uncle Sam thinks about Tor, or Bitcoin, or marijuana, or culture sharing, because Uncle Sam won't have any (real) money to pay his armed thugs to come get you with.

Innovations like this do work in most cases most of the time.  But can we make a replacement for the air, the ocean, the trees, the bees, the endangered and soon to be extinct species?  The earth provides us with so many natural services that it would be economically unfeasible if not outright impossible to replace. 
When it comes to fossil fuels, the problem is **net energy**. For most other resources, scarcity doesn't necessarily matter as much as technology and our ingenuity will allow us access to deposits that previously were not profitable.
For oil however, even if the price is $1,000,000 per barrel, it's still pointless on a large scale to pursue it when you have to use more than a barrel of oil to get it. 
**It requires ever more energy use to extract a barrel of oil from this planet**, and that's what I'm worried about.

First of all, despite those sugar-coated criticisms, there is still a mile-wide gap between Bitpay's position, and [the one I share with Mr. Fenton]( 
Perhaps worst of all, Bitpay had the audacity to endorse the LEGAL MINIMUM 45-day window!
Lawsky took a year to write those regs, and most others in the space have called for the full year (legal max) to review and comment on these proposed regulations.


No, you don't **have** to. There is **always** a choice between maintaining one's principles and dropping them for the sake of smooth profit. This goes way beyond "kissing ass". This is more like **selling out**!
Bitpay has the advantage of being one of the most established companies in the space, they seem prepared to let all the newcomers fall by the wayside if it means smooth sailing for them.

But **real** capitalism. This World, now, today, this is what it looks like. Yes, it's a fucking nightmare dystopia for most humans on this planet.
You need to **accept reality** before you can change it for the better. If you start from a place of denial such as "no it's only federalism", or "no it's only corporatism", you will be useless for helping this planet and its inhabitants.

Bitcoin isn't cash, my private keys aren't something that even needs to exist in the physical world.
For example:
No one can steal my private keys without the use of tremendous violence, as my bitcoins are stored in a brain wallet and other of my BTC are  multisig and stored in 3 separate safety deposit boxes, all of which have human beings guarding them.

I bought my first 15 coins when the price was around 140. After I bought, there was a period of pricedrop followed by a long stagnation. A few months later, China went in and the price boomed to over 1,000.
I sold 5 coins at 1,000 and held 10. 
My initial investment of $2,100 yielded $5,000 return (that's $2,900 straight profit) PLUS the 10 remaining BTC I still have, currently valued at ~$5,600. In retrospect I wish I'd bought more, but hindsight in always 20/20.
All that, in less than one year.
The lesson? Hold and be patient.

You don't have to extrapolate anything, though.

You are thinking, "omg if they had held that'd be worth 13 grand today!". That's true, but this is a flawed comparison. Let me explain. Those numbers are all the way from March 2011.

No, there is no concept of ownership.  Bitcoin keys enable **control**. That is all. 
1 key can be copied infinite number of times and given to as many people as you choose. That is not possible with any form of **property**. Ownership is a concept you bring to the conversation. It's not inherent to the protocol in any way. No more than property is inherent the Earth.

@_date: 2014-08-27 14:06:56
Right. On the blockchain, the concept of "ownership" doesn't really apply.
Think of the blockchain as a huge series of glass safety deposit boxes, transparent but impenetrable. Anyone on the planet can go visit these boxes, see what's inside, and even make a deposit to any box (blockchain address) they choose. However, the glass itself is invulnerable to attack.
You either have the (private) keys to a particular box (address) or you don't. The vast majority of boxes (addresses) has only one or two sets of keys, privately held. The keys to some of the boxes have been destroyed, which means you can put money in, but never take it out, sort of like a black hole for wealth.
Some of these boxes (addresses) may have publicly known "private" keys, which is the same as saying they are always "unlocked" for public use.

Civilization is based on a clearly defined and widely accepted yet often unarticulated hierarchy. Violence done by those higher on the hierarchy to those lower is nearly always invisible, that is, unnoticed. When it is noticed, it is fully rationalized.

No, the difference between us is that I have observation and deduction on my side, where as you seem to lack these skills entirely. 
If Satoshi was interested in wealth, logic dictates that he would've already spend at least some portion of his 600 million. Why, you ask? Because there is no conceivable reason why he **wouldn't** do so, unless he never intended to touch any of the money in the first place.
5 years and not a penny spent. Would you have me believe he won't spend $10,000 or $100,000 out of $6,000,000, just so he can have some more wealth later when Bitcoin gains value? I find that improbable in the extreme. 
Sooner or later you're going to have to face it: **the creation of Bitcoin was a gift to the world**.
And consider this: even in your worst case scenario where in Satoshi is just one more greedy asshole hoarding wealth for himself, wouldn't the fact that not a penny of it has been touched be an extremely bullish indication?
So your worst case scenario is a strong argument that Bitcoin will continue gain value logarithmically.
Tell me again how that is even remotely bad? ??
@_date: 2014-07-21 11:47:08


Bitcoin's value proposition is not merely rooted in the intrinsic value of its utility (the blockchain), it's also deeply rooted in the (ever-growing) scope of its network, which is several orders of magnitude larger than any of its competitors.


If some other crypto adds a feature that most of the world decides we like, that feature can (and will) be added to the Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin is adaptive, organic. 
I recommend watching this talk, [Bitcoin the organism]( to understand what I mean when I say that.

But we'll get through the transition just as we have many times before.

Actually, no one owns them. 
On the blockchain, the concept of "ownership" doesn't really apply. There is only the question of **control**.
Think of the blockchain as a huge series of glass safety deposit boxes, transparent but impenetrable. Anyone on the planet can go visit these boxes, see what's inside, and even make a deposit to any box (blockchain address) they choose. However, the glass itself is invulnerable to attack.
You either have the (private) keys to a particular box (address) or you don't. The vast majority of boxes (addresses) has only one or two sets of keys, privately held. The keys to some of the boxes have been destroyed, which means you can put money in, but never take it out, sort of like a black hole for wealth.
Some of these boxes (addresses) may have publicly known "private" keys, which is the same as saying they are always "unlocked" for public use. 
With the advent of cryptocurrency, math - public information, became a form of currency. I think a lot of people miss how monumental an innovation this is. This is why it is fundamentally insane to treat bitcoin like you would some "foreign currency" that needs to be strictly regulated. This changes everything. You don't add Bitcoin to the legal books, you throw away the books and write new ones. 
Bitcoin changed the rules. You can't legislate while pretending that didn't happen. That's why the NY Bitlicense is piss-poor lawmaking. Bitcoin isn't foreign anywhere on Earth. Because it's free to everyone, anywhere there's internet.

I think you are underestimating the financial incentive to exploit said bugs by about 8 billion US dollars. Again, if it were possible to profit from exploiting bugs currently in the protocol, it would already have happened. There are MANY, many hackers targeting this thing, for good reason. It is literally money.


Nope, and I don't have to since not of my BTC is stored with them.


I agree. **Upward volatility** with bitcoin rocketing toward 2000 + USD as we move from the innovation/infancy phase into early adoption.


White/blacklists would not destroy bitcoin. It would be a fork, one half would survive and the other would not. Anyone with coins already on the chain before the fork would be unaffected.


Something tells me you haven't been paying attention to [inequality in the fiat realm](


Satoshi has over 500 million USD in bitcoin, yet he has not used 1 penny of it. What possible reasoning could he have to continue leaving his stash untouched at this late hour, other than "he is leading by example and never had any intention of trading a single coin for fiat?"

Quite the opposite. I'm telling you to accept the inevitability of human social progress. I'm telling you to face reality:
*"Before capitalism, there were other ways. Feudalism was what existed in Europe for a thousand years before we had modern capitalism. And before that, slavery - yet another system - another way of organizing who does the work and who gets the profits and so on. And the interesting thing is that every other system that we have a record of in the human race, was born, evolved over time, and eventually passed away.* 
*What always has intrigued me, is the need for those people living in capitalism today, to think it's going to be the great exception. It was born, basically in England 300 years ago, it has evolved over the last three centuries. But when you say, "yes, but that means it will also pass away and give rise to another system", people get all kinds of strange worries because they don't want to think about that.* 
**And so they begin to imagine that this system [capitalism] will be forever, in a way no other system in history has proved itself to be."**

As one waxes, the other diminishes. Our children deserve better than to inherit the same violent, coercive, deceptive neo-feudal planet of empires that we did.

I would encourage you to explore intellectual material outside of what your teachers have assigned you, such as:
An excerpt:
"...Capitalism: A Structural Genocide. In essence, he argues cogently in this work that the devastating structural violence experienced by societies subjected to the rule of capital since its historical emergence - and that particularly felt by the world's presently impoverished social majorities - is, instead of being an aberration or distortion of market imperatives, central and inherent to the division of society along class lines and the enthronement of private property. Even a cursory examination of the depth of human suffering perpetuated historically and contemporarily by the hegemony of capital should lead disinterested observers to agree with Leech that the catastrophic scale of violence for which this system is responsible can be considered nothing less than genocidal, however shocking such a conclusion might prove to be."

Fiat exchange price matters for bitcoin until the time when you can buy food and pay rent with your BTC.

You have no way of knowing what they'll do with their coins, nor is it any of your business. This is a free market, no one is stealing from anyone, or everyone is stealing from everyone all the time. One or the other. Either way, Bitcoin will be fine. Week to week value is chaotic like the weather, the year over year trends are what matters.
The only meaningful definition of theft IS property, anyway. Go read some Proudhon.

No, it does not cause price fluctuations. Once again, [*hoarding does nothing other than CEMENT INCREASED VALUE*]( Panic buying and selling causes price fluctuations. If the IQ distrubtion of the population was something other than a bell curve, Bitcoin may not have any price fluctuations at all, and fiat currency would've been worthless and obsolete by midyear 2010. But that's not the world we live in.


I am perfectly comfortable with **my** Bitcoin "not doing anything" **right now** because 99.9% of the world hasn't figured out what they're dealing with yet, and it's uses are still fairly limited. In 2-3 years that will no longer be the case.

Will you? Truly?
"Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth – more than ruin, more even than death. Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible; thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habits; thought is anarchic and lawless, indifferent to authority, careless of the well-tried wisdom of the ages. 
Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. It sees man, a feeble speck, surrounded by unfathomable depths of silence; yet it bears itself proudly, as unmoved as if it were lord of the universe. Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man."

**Tim Byun, BitPay’s Chief Compliance Officer offered the following thoughts**:
I.  It is commendable that NY DFS and Ben Lawsky are supporting innovation while ensuring balanced regulations.
II. The proposed framework reflects DFS’:
·         Strong understanding of the bitcoin ecosystem, including valuable services to consumers that would benefit from an emerging, efficient and cheaper payment system
·         Strong understanding of Anti-Money Laundering/Anti-Terrorist Financing and Trade Sanction obligations, including existing Virtual Currency regulations and exemptions at the Federal level.
·         Ability to leverage the Bank Secrecy Act and the significant resources that are already expended by the bitcoin ecosystem to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing requirements.
·         Openness in setting a standard in the next 45 days that will likely be followed by other states.

"Rising empathy will vanquish violence in the 21st century **or humanity will wipe itself out**."
I'm sure Stephen Hawking thinks your opinions are naive too.


"Always" is a lot longer than you think it is. Ten thousand years isn't even the blink of an eye, as far as Always is concerned. Consider how much humanity has progressed in the last century alone. What evidence do you have to support the theory that civilization will suddenly cease social evolution at a point when it is accelerating faster than ever before?


I make no such proposal, and regard it as hideously unethical. The [non-aggression principle]( must be the singular core upon which any rational system of ethics is built. In modern civilization, the non-aggression principle orbits the sovereignty of the nation state, that usurper. This is barbaric and the worst kind of primitive. 
The fact that even a single person alive today - to say nothing of the millions of millennials with anti-authoritarian leanings - recognizes this reality means the shift to a new civilization has been underway for quite a long time. The internet is doing to present civilization the same thing the printing press did to feudal society. It's an update, a major patch that will cause a storm of change that only comes around once every few generations. We haven't seen one like this in over three hundred years.
“Whoever lays his hand on me to govern me is a usurper and a tyrant: I declare him my enemy.”
“The strategic adversary is fascism... the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us.”
“We feel free because we lack the very language to articulate our unfreedom.”
Feudal serfs probably thought they were free folk too, comparing themselves to outright slaves. Most humans alive today are closer to feudal serfs than they are to free people, but perceptions are relative so they feel free. In reality we are human-cows on the big farm managed by the violence of the nation state, and increasingly corporations.

"Novus Ordo Seclorum" is [printed on US dollars]( and it means "New order of the ages" --&gt; AKA New world Order
The second one refers to [Freigeld]( a form of currency that existed briefly created by Silvio Gesell. 
The properties of this special money were as follows:
-It is maintained by a monetary authority to be spending power stable (no inflation or deflation) by means of printing more money or withdrawing money from circulation
-It is cash flow safe (a scheme is put in place to ensure that the money is returned into the cash flow - for example, by demurrage - requiring stamps to be purchased and periodically attached to the money to keep it valid)
-It is convertible into other currencies
-It is localized to a certain area (it is a local currency)
In other words, an early form of libertarian money sharing the values of Bitcoin, a hundred years before the internet.

Premise 4: "Civilization is based on a clearly defined and widely accepted yet often unarticulated hierarchy. Violence done by those higher on the hierarchy to those lower is nearly always invisible, that is, unnoticed. When it is noticed, it is fully rationalized. Violence done by those lower on the hierarchy to those higher is unthinkable, and when it does occur is regarded with shock, horror, and the fetishization of the victims."
Our world is governed by violence today just as it was in medieval europe. Sure, we dress our violence up real nice these days, we justify it all sorts of ways, but when it comes down to it, nations govern primarily by violence and use reason mostly to justify their actions.
The historians of the distant future will probably not see much distinction between modern life and the "dark ages" as we call them, rather they will define history by the rule of violence vs. the rule of reason. That is, if our species survives long enough to socially evolve into a civilization governed by reason rather than by violence.

The problem with your point of view is that you live in a culture which systematically indoctrinates 99% of children into becoming adult infants. There's a reason classrooms have 1 authority figure kids must compete to impress, and are age-segregated as they are. There's a reason American classrooms are rife with anti - intellectual sentiment and bullying.  The last thing they need is kids learning to question authority during their formative years! So this is what that social engineering gets us... generations of obedient but selfish assholes.
 And you assume people are born that way. They're not, as it turns out. Cretins like us are created deliberately because it serves the interests of those pulling the strings in education.  Check out a book called The Underground History of American Education and you'll see what I'm talking about, it's free to read online. 
Or are you just yet another American idiot who has never visited a place on this earth not dominated by western colonialism? Another fool who has never bothered to study history or prehistory and place your nation's economy culture is its context geographically and historically? Have you ever tried learning about alternative economy cultures of the past or present, or dared to imagine new possibilities for the future? 
I'm not a libertarian,  I can't stand those folks, they are intellectually shallow in that they fail to form any critique of capitalism. I'm a post-capitalist thinker.

People are often incredulous when I explain to them that ownership is a legal concept arising from a set of social contracts ultimately backed by threat of violence,  and why this doesn't apply in Bitcoin. The fact of the blockchain's legal agnosticism is vital to fungibility. It's code as law, this makes obsolete the entire system of financial adjudication.
 A decentralized transparent tamper-proof public ledger does not need adjudication, it does not need censorship or licensure, it does not need "regulation". To even use this term in the context of bitcoin is farcical! It is fiat that is unregulated, with its arbitrary expansion of the money supply (inflation), bitcoin by contrast has controlled, mathematically provable deflation rate.  Like any decentralized network organismn bitcoin will regard any such resistance as damage and route around it effortlessly, like a river around stones. In the end even the most hostile poltiical environments will be overwhelmed by the sheer usefulness of this technology.

It's not arbitrary AT ALL. Nothing like this has ever happened before,  and the fact that this network existed - functionally - for a time while being worth nothing in exchange terms is critical to understanding how and why there is no upper limit to how much wealth Bitcoin can (will) absorb. 
You see, Bitcoin doesn't create wealth the way fiat does. Bitcoin *can't* create wealth,  **it can only absorb existing wealth already in the economy.** That's precisely how it went from 0$ to 6bil $, and that's how it will get from 6 billion to All the Rest. 
In the ancient world they had no concept of zero. Coreectly adding this concept to our vision of the laws of the universe (which we call mathematics) changed everything for humanity,  just as Nakamoto Consensus and the financial singularity it has created will change everything once again.

And my point is no, that's not how economics works at all. Satoshi doesn't set anything,  the market determines value *based on demand for Bitcoin*.
Satoshi **has** clearly indicated what he thinks btc is worth in fiat terms - he has never melted btc for a single dollar. Meaning Satoshi has not yet found an exchange rate to be even remotely acceptable - despite having a million btc even $1100 / btc wasn't a good enough offer to get him to part with a single bitcoin. It may be that no amount of fiat will ever be good enough for Satoshi to exchange btc for it.
So you see it is only *despite* Satoshi's total unwillingness to accept fiat scrip in exchange for bitcoin under his/her/their control that the market continues to find an exchange rate.
This is because other, lesser minds like mine are often perfectly willing to settle for 2-3x the value in fiat scrip that we originally paid for our coins.
@_date: 2016-01-11 01:14:10


No. Satoshi can't give any coins value by himself. It takes at least two people to establish an exchange rate - one of which must offer goods and services in *exchange* for btc. The rate at which the first person(s) accepted bitcoin in exchange for fiat is established at the moment the first bitcoin transaction is completed.
Satoshi didn't point to the blockchain one day and proclaim, "this is worth ten dollars now". Someone accepted bitcoin as payment, thus giving btc an exchange rate.

Personally, I haven't seen any compelling evidence that Satoshi Nakamoto is an individual. I believe it's a group. 




Long run it doesn't really matter which crypto wins, the important thing is that this financial singularity is a storm which our mortally-wounded capitalism will not survive. 
This breakthrough - Nakamoto Consensus - marks the beginning of the end of this neo-feudal era, this dark age in which we live. It marks the beginning of the information age proper, as we now have a modern tool for record keeping unlike anything that has come before.
 All that said, Ethereum is an asinine reinvention of the Bitcoin wheel designed for the same worthless, hallow reason all other altcoins are: greed. If that hurts to hear,  it means you're emotionally invested in your belief.


You sound desperately unsure of yourself. The difference between Satoshi Nakamoto and all the pathetic imitators is that the shitcoiners wouldn't hold. They'd happily murder their own baby and burn all the investors if it made them rich personally.
Don't you get it?  That's why Ethereum can never win. Bitcoin has something you'll never have, an ideology so powerful nothing can resist it. This isn't just a war of technology,  it's a war of ideas, and in that field Bitcoin has no competition. It will sweep over this world first ideologically,  and *then* financially. Resistance is futile.

Yes, the democratization of money creation is all well and good, but it's more than that. The seemingly arbitrary redistribution of wealth from one set of financial elite to another should be a system shock too damning for capitalism to survive in its current weakened state.

Start with all wealth on Earth. Now set aside whatever amount of wealth is required to provide decent food, water, shelter, healthcare and non-indoctrinative education (with non-aggression as core ethical principle) **all ~~human~~ sentient beings as a birthright**. Regardless of birth nation, current geographic location, race, ethnicity, religion, creed, gender, sexual-orientation, nobody asked to be here, so everybody gets the basics of  survival. Everybody lives life without fear of the terrible sufferings of starvation and death by exposure. 
Once that's done. I don't give a damn what happens with the rest of the wealth. You can play capitalism with luxuries to your hearts content, comrade. I'd prefer from each what they can offer, to each what they need, and leave desires for after. I'll add that I don't believe it's an accident that there's 2,100,000,000,000,000 units in BTC and 7,000,000 humans alive today. I think that choice is a message.

There is no reason to be found there, because there can be no justification for aggression. The non-aggression principle is now moving to the center of ethics where it rightfully belongs.

Capitalism is a dead thing walking already, there's no possible future in which we continue the path we're on (and survive).  We just need to figure out a sane and egalitarian means to transcend it. 
Nakamoto consensus offers a way forward that was previously impossible: a potentially peaceful exit path that national government power cannot interfere with.

Great read, thanks for sharing.  


The problem of a shrinking node ecosysyem is illusory, temporary. A problem of chronomyopia. I've said it before and I'll say it again, understanding Bitcoin is made far more difficult when your predictions fail to **assume** an exponential increase in demand. Mining will become far more profitable just after any price boom, a mining economy [= many new nodes] can spring up out of thin air as real value is "created" (read: siphoned from fiat) from suddenly surging demand. 
This is precisely what I mean when I say Bitcoin is a financial singularity - in this analogy national fiat currencies are massive and ancient stars - full of mass (wealth) waiting to be extracted by a network that has already siphoned 6 billion USD from them in the first six years of existence.


Bitcoin is a software protocol, organic, adaptive. [In a way, very much alive]( My premise is a simple one: As humanity gets better at computer science, mathematics, cryptography, network engineering, and so on - Bitcoin also gets better as a currency - because *we'll be better at engineering it*. In retrospect it seems to me that there was a tremendous lack of focus on "civil cryptography" before Bitcoin created this new financial incentive.

Fast / Secure / Cheap (pick two)
This is like complaining that storing gold at Fort Knox is more expensive than storing cash under your mattress. Good security costs money. They wouldn't be dedicating all that security protecting ~$5.25 worth of gold at Fort Knox. 
We probably do have to be more expensive than credit cards. Credit cards have shit-tier security, that's why they don't just go giving them out to anyone. That's also why, instead of the end-user, a 3rd party (bank) is financially responsible in the (constant) fraud cases involving credit cards.
That's also why all new credit card systems are moving from a metallic-strip swipe-system to a noticeably *slower* chip-based system. For the user this feels like a big step backwards technologically as the chip authorization takes 2-3 times longer.

There isn't room for you in the upper echelons of the pyramid, and there never will be. This is by design, not accident.


Even putting aside the fact that a fifth of continental U.S. landmass was stolen from Mexico, the United States prospers today only by taking from the rest of the world, especially from the global south which includes Mexico.

"The moment one thinks in the terms of "yes, the WTC collapse was a tragedy, but one should not fully solidarize with the victims, since this would mean supporting US imperialism," the ethical catastrophy is already here: the only appropriate stance is the unconditional solidarity will ALL victims. The ethical stance proper is here replaced with the moralizing mathematics of guilt and horror which misses the key point: **the terrifying death of each individual is absolute and incomparable.**"

The answer is still no. Even if you had a paper wallet or brain wallet with 10 mil,  you are not **carrying** ANY bitcoin. It's a decentralized ledger, you are carrying key(s). Think of the blockchain like an infinitely large set of safety deposit boxes. A bitcoin "wallet" is a actually a keychain for some of those.

There will be many orders of magnitude more miners securing the network than there are now, because the network will be much more valuable and important.

Yes, and those people are correct. Bitcoin **is** going to devour all the fiat scrip wealth on this planet because it is a baby black hole, a financial singularity. It is incomparable to any form of currency that has ever existed on this planet, completely in a league of its own.
What most bitcoiners don't realize, is that the chaotic nature of this transition from national fiat scrip - "full faith and credit of ___" money - to denational (provable AKA scientific) money is going to be a **major** system shock for capitalism. This has never happened before. This major computer science breakthrough wasn't supposed to happen. The High Priests of capitalism don't have any contingency plan for an event like this, the game has changed, they are fish out of water now. 
**Capitalism is a very old man lying on a hospital bed**. In Greece, he's dying and moaning out in pain with no medicine to be found. Here in the USA, he is on life support since 1963 (gold standard dropped) and on a nonstop heroin drop (0% interest rates) since 2008. **The transition from fiat to crypto is a full blood transfusion**.

I wasn't saying there was any reason to be afraid, at least not for anyone storing their wealth in bitcoin. Fiat (faithnote scrip) and gold (pet rock) bagholders are the ones who should be terrified of losing their wealth.
Death and violence are nature's drama - there's a ton of churn in Earth's ecosystem. This churn, this drama, is a sign of the vitality of our planet, not the opposite. The same applies to information age money. I'm only saying that we should **expect** drama, **not** that we fear it, *because bitcoin is such an important invention*, and today it is hugely undervalued both politically and financially.

Sure, but that requires the attackers knowing who the person is associated with a particular address. OpSec does matter when storing wealth of any kind, I can't deny that. It's one of the reasons you're supposed to do cold storage stuff offline. 
Even then it's a huge risk to be taking for whoever is thinking of kidnapping and/or torturing a person for money. Not my area of expertise but I'd bet it's not a very easy crime to get away with. To say nothing of multi-sig or time locked transaction.

No Theymos, you've got it backwards. A hard fork is not a death knell for bitcoin, just the opposite. Some combination of fear and greed have blinded you. Forks are a sign of vitality - a normal and healthy part of the maturation of this protocol, and ultimately the democratic means through which the community makes decisions.
We're now faced with the first real hard fork and everyone is shitting their pants like it's the end of the world, when in reality it is only the beginning. Forks are biodiversity in the ecology of money. 
**Mark my words, as this technology matures we will see MORE drama and MORE forks, not less**, and this is normal and probably totally unavoidable. Money is WAY too contentious for it to go down any other way!  If you think it's bad now, when we're dealing with a tiny ~4 billion market cap, [you ain't seen nothing yet]( 
As the old saying goes, if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.

Doing this helps provide some meaning to an otherwise mostly miserable existence.

Unsuccessful people who resent themselves for their unhappiness love to imagine other people losing big. It makes them feel slightly less awful about their own misery. 
That's why Buttcoin is a thing, it's a form of catharsis for people who desperately want to liberate themselves from their wageslave existence, but are too terrified to invest in something as risky as bitcoin and/or don't have any money to invest. The tragedy is that they're going to resent themselves a hundred fold more intensely after bitcoin's next moonboom. Pity them.

Keys = keys
Wallet = keychain
Blockchain = Publicly accessible set of totally transparent but totally indestructible safety deposit boxes (many times over more than we'll ever need; effectively infinite). 
Bitcoin = digital cash stored in those boxes
You can't take the cash out of the boxes, only transfer the wealth between one box or another and buy/sell keys. You can, however, lose or destroy your key, which effectively "destroys" whatever wealth was stored in the box(es) your key(s) unlocked. 
Each box has a tiny slit in the top where you or anyone else can drop money in. But you can't move money to another box without the correct key(s). 
Ownership does not apply on the blockchain, only access/control. Keys can easily be transferred between Individuals (or nations) without anyone knowing. 
Pseudonymous money, not anonymous money. Bitcoin is actually extremely transparent money. Imagine those boxes are surrounded by cameras, but everyone who uses them is wearing a mask and costume. Everything that happens with the wealth is recorded permanently on the blockchain for all to see.
Hope this helps.

Legal ownership, access, and control are three different things. Legal ownership is one of many possible routes to access and/or control of wealth - be it crypto or fiat. 
For example, I have both legal ownership of and access to bitcoin wealth on my Coinbase account, but I don't truly have control over those coins.
For the inverse, secretly digging a hole in the ground and burying a safe with a paper wallet or harddrive inside ensures almost total control, but makes access extremely inconvenient and provides no legal protection whatsoever, since only you know about it.
Point is, Bitcoin provides an ever-expanding array of options,  whilst also becoming cumulatively more user-friendly as time progresses. The legacy banking system, by contrast,  offers no real innovation since the credit card - and we all know how *that* turned out.

“America touts itself as the land of the free, but the number one freedom that you and I have is the freedom to enter into a subservient role in the workplace. Once you exercise this freedom you’ve lost all control over what you do, what is produced, and how it is produced. And in the end, the product doesn’t belong to you. The only way you can avoid bosses and jobs is if you don’t care about making a living. Which leads to the second freedom: the freedom to starve.”

“That's libertarians for you — ~~anarchists~~ capitalists who want police protection from their slaves.” 
― Kim Stanley Robinson, Green Mars
“If democracy and self-rule are the fundamentals, then why should people give up these rights when they enter their workplace? In politics we fight like tigers for freedom, for the right to elect our leaders, for freedom of movement, choice of residence, choice of what work to pursue—control of our lives, in short. And then we wake up in the morning and go to work, and all those rights disappear. We no longer insist on them. And so for most of the day we return to feudalism. That is what capitalism is—a version of feudalism in which capital replaces land, and business leaders replace kings. But the hierarchy remains. And so we still hand over our lives’ labor, under duress, to feed rulers who do no real work.”
― Kim Stanley Robinson, Blue Mars
“We will go out into the world and plant gardens and orchards to the horizons, we will build roads through the mountains and across the deserts, and terrace the mountains and irrigate the deserts until there will be garden everywhere, and plenty for all, and there will be no more empires or kingdoms, no more caliphs, sultans, emirs, khans, or zamindars, no more kings or queens or princes, no more quadis or mullahs or ulema, no more slavery and no more usury, no more property and no more taxes, no more rich and no more poor, no killing or maiming or torture or execution, no more jailers and no more prisoners, no more generals, soldiers, armies or navies, no more patriarchy, no more caste, no more hunger, no more suffering than what life brings us for being born and having to die, and then we will see for the first time what kind of creatures we really are.” 
― Kim Stanley Robinson, The Years of Rice and Salt
“We were outside the world, we didn't even own things -- some clothes. . . . This arrangement resembles the prehistoric way to live, and it therefore feels right to us, because our brains recognize it from 3 millions of years practicing it. In essence our brains grew to their current configuration in response to the realities of that life. So as a result people grow powerfully attached to that kind of life, when they get the chance to live it. It allows you to concentrate your attention on the real work, which means everything that is done to stay alive, to make things, or satisfy one's curiosity, or play. That is utopia.”

“To a very great extent human history has been the story of the unequal accumulation of harvested wealth, shifting from one centre of power to another, while always expanding the four great inequalities. This is history. 
**Nowhere, as far as I know, has there ever been a civilization or moment when the wealth of the harvests, created by all, has been equitably distributed**. 
Power has been exerted wherever it can be, and each successful coercion has done its part to add to the general inequality, which has risen in direct proportion to the wealth gathered; for wealth and power are much the same. The possessors of the wealth in effect buy the armed power they need to enforce the growing inequality. And so the cycle continues.”

Bitcoin's code is Bitcoin's regulation. You don't legally regulate code after it's already been written, that's over-engineering. Any such regulation would be local (read: irrelevant) and would be disregarded as damage and routed around by the network.
In other words, it's not even that no regulation is needed, it's that *no (enforceable) legal regulation is even possible* in this system. **Bitcoin is sovereign**. It will take some time for the governments of most nation states to adjust to their new (rightful) place as subservient entities existing only by the will of the people they serve - this has never happened before.

Couldn't help but notice you didn't [adjust for inflation]( friend.
[I'll just leave this here](


I get that you guys are [new to this](  whole anarchist thing but here's the basics: **it's about ethics. Compassion is the heart of ethics. It really is that simple.**
 Capitalism is not a compassionate system,  and for this reason compassionate intelligent people rightfully want to smash it in the fucking face with a nuclear baseball bat. **And we will, because more like us will be born with each new generation**.  There's nothing that can stop this now. It's the internet effect.
**Are "anarcho"-capitalists really anarchists?**
In a word, no. While "anarcho"-capitalists obviously try to associate themselves with the anarchist tradition by using the word "anarcho" or by calling themselves "anarchists" their ideas are distinctly at odds with those associated with anarchism. As a result, any claims that their ideas are anarchist or that they are part of the anarchist tradition or movement are false.
"Anarcho"-capitalists claim to be anarchists because they say that they oppose government. As noted in the last section, they use a dictionary definition of anarchism. However, this fails to appreciate that anarchism is a political theory. As dictionaries are rarely politically sophisticated things, this means that they fail to recognise that anarchism is more than just opposition to government, it is also marked a opposition to capitalism (i.e. exploitation and private property). Thus, opposition to government is a necessary but not sufficient condition for being an anarchist -- you also need to be opposed to exploitation and capitalist private property. As "anarcho"-capitalists do not consider interest, rent and profits (i.e. capitalism) to be exploitative nor oppose capitalist property rights, they are not anarchists.
Part of the problem is that Marxists, like many academics, also tend to assert that anarchists are simply against the state. It is significant that both Marxists and "anarcho"-capitalists tend to define anarchism as purely opposition to government. This is no co-incidence, as both seek to exclude anarchism from its place in the wider socialist movement. This makes perfect sense from the Marxist perspective as it allows them to present their ideology as the only serious anti-capitalist one around (not to mention associating anarchism with "anarcho"-capitalism is an excellent way of discrediting our ideas in the wider radical movement). It should go without saying that this is an obvious and serious misrepresentation of the anarchist position as even a superficial glance at anarchist theory and history shows that no anarchist limited their critique of society simply at the state. So while academics and Marxists seem aware of the anarchist opposition to the state, they usually fail to grasp the anarchist critique applies to all other authoritarian social institutions and how it fits into the overall anarchist analysis and struggle. They seem to think the anarchist condemnation of capitalist private property, patriarchy and so forth are somehow superfluous additions rather than a logical position which reflects the core of anarchism:
 
"Critics have sometimes contended that anarchist thought, and classical anarchist theory in particular, has emphasised opposition to the state to the point of neglecting the real hegemony of economic power. This interpretation arises, perhaps, from a simplistic and overdrawn distinction between the anarchist focus on political domination and the Marxist focus on economic exploitation . . . there is abundant evidence against such a thesis throughout the history of anarchist thought." [John P. Clark and Camille Martin, Anarchy, Geography, Modernity, p. 95]
So Reclus simply stated the obvious when he wrote that "the anti-authoritarian critique to which the state is subjected applies equally to all social institutions." [quoted by Clark and Martin, Op. Cit., p. 140] Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, Goldman and so on would all agree with that. While they all stressed that anarchism was against the state they quickly moved on to present a critique of private property and other forms of hierarchical authority. So while anarchism obviously opposes the state, "sophisticated and developed anarchist theory proceeds further. It does not stop with a criticism of political organisation, but goes on to investigate the authoritarian nature of economic inequality and private property, hierarchical economic structures, traditional education, the patriarchal family, class and racial discrimination, and rigid sex- and age-roles, to mention just a few of the more important topics." For the "essence of anarchism is, after all, not the theoretical opposition to the state, but the practical and theoretical struggle against domination." [John Clark, The Anarchist Moment, p. 128 and p. 70]
This is also the case with individualist anarchists whose defence of certain forms of property did stop them criticising key aspects of capitalist property rights. As Jeremy Jennings notes, the "point to stress is that all anarchists, and not only those wedded to the predominant twentieth-century strain of anarchist communism have been critical of private property to the extent that it was a source of hierarchy and privilege." He goes on to state that anarchists like Tucker and Spooner "agreed with the proposition that property was legitimate only insofar as it embraced no more than the total product of individual labour." ["Anarchism", Contemporary Political Ideologies, Roger Eatwell and Anthony Wright (eds.), p. 132] This is acknowledged by the likes of Rothbard who had to explicitly point how that his position on such subjects was fundamentally different (i.e., at odds) with individualist anarchism.
As such, it would be fair to say that most "anarcho"-capitalists are capitalists first and foremost. If aspects of anarchism do not fit with some element of capitalism, they will reject that element of anarchism rather than question capitalism (Rothbard's selective appropriation of the individualist anarchist tradition is the most obvious example of this). This means that right-"libertarians" attach the "anarcho" prefix to their ideology because they believe that being against government intervention is equivalent to being an anarchist (which flows into their use of the dictionary definition of anarchism). That they ignore the bulk of the anarchist tradition should prove that there is hardly anything anarchistic about them at all. They are not against authority, hierarchy or the state -- they simply want to privatise them.

[**Credit score is modern slavery**]( 
Capitalism is an over-engineered and very racist neo-feudal system. Capitalism is about 350 years old. It is a system of resource distribution that is premised on a set of myths (read: bad assumptions) that have since been debunked. It's a system engineered in the late 1600s - early 1700s. Newtonian physics was still a radical new idea. All of the people (read: wealthy caucasian male elders) who designed the framework of this system owned slaves. Think about that. This is a century and a half before electricity was invented. **The scientific method itself was only just becoming vogue!** They weren't anywhere near as good at systems engineering as we are today.

Yes, because **rights** are a thing that one must claim and defend for oneself, unlike privileges which are granted by central authority (e.g. bank access, which 2.5 bil humans don't have). 
Using bitcoin is a now a de facto birthright for every person on earth. Bitcoin is usable with 2005 SMS dumbphone. Bitcoin changes (read: improves) financial sovereignty - gives it back to the individual where it belongs. This new definition of sovereignty and the old one can't coexist, at least not for very long. Ten or fifteen years max I'd guess.
**There can only be one source of financial sovereignty** - state power (violence) or decentralized transparent mathematics (reason). It's that oldest of zero-sum games: **reason vs violence**. The question is, which wins in the 21st century? Will it be the old faith and credit based system that survives this interaction, or the new provably sound  transparent tamper-proof ledger? **Information wants to be free...**  The cracks in the dam are growing... soon it will break.

I agree, but it's not about them being bad or good. It's about them being obsolete.


No, because the US dollar is local scrip money, like every other national fiat. Only Bitcoin is global, ergo only Bitcoin is sovereign. This really is a "there can only be one" scenario, not because local money is bad or whatever other emotional argument you think I'm making, but because *we only need one* public global ledger of account. All the rest is fluff / trimmings / chaff / over-engineered useless parts now. As this technology matures, all the parts of the unnecessary gears of the global financial system will be stripped away. 
Why? The same reason we don't have the pony express anymore, or vast networks of carrier pigeons or fax machines. It's the same reason we move almost no information on the [legacy telecommunications network]( these days.  These things are obsolete now - worthless fluff in the new economy. The source of intrinsic value of money itself has been changed - it's not longer faith and credit that matters now - it's observable mathematics that has the real substance. This is a self-evident truth which can only be denied for so long.


No, it won't. Bitcoin isn't anything like gold or silver - **Bitcoin is a financial singularity that renders Gold into a *relatively* worthless pet rock** just as easily as it renders a $100 bill into toilet paper. This is a monster which will eat **all wealth on this planet** with the cold indifference of a black hole. There are no exceptions and there is no escaping this Armageddon Clock of money.


Bitcoin is censorship-resistance. The financially sovereignty Bitcoin empowers individuals with has literally changed my life (in ways I unfortunately cannot fully discuss at this time). I believe Bitcoin is how humanity transcends capitalism and the concept of wealth as we know it. I think capitalism has ~15 years left on this planet maximum.

That's because violence is a very poor leveraging tool on the blockchain, and for the first time in history governments will have to accept serving (notice I didn't say ruling) at the mercy of the people.

Ownership doesn't apply on the blockchain. It's a protocol,  a distributed ledger of account, ~~addresses not bound to any single human identity. Keys to locks, that's all we hold, but the keys are just information,  you can make infinite copies at zero cost! Don't forget the golden rule: **information wants to be free!** Fee diddly dee, bitcoin kills capitalism. Hey diddly oh, Cryptosocialism is coming~~. 
Legal ownership, access, and control are three different things. Legal ownership is one of many possible routes to access and/or control of wealth - be it crypto or fiat.
For example, I have both legal ownership of and access to bitcoin wealth on my Coinbase account, but I don't truly have control over those coins.
For the inverse, secretly digging a hole in the ground and burying a safe with a paper wallet or harddrive inside ensures almost total control, but makes access extremely inconvenient and provides no legal protection whatsoever, since only you know about it.
Bitcoin provides an ever-expanding array of options, whilst also becoming cumulatively more user-friendly as time progresses. The legacy banking system, by contrast, offers no real innovation since the credit card - and we all know how that turned out.

That's not how a foundation functions. The original job is to support everything built atop and to act as the settlement layer. You don't weaken a foundation for the sake of building something on it. That's how you get a collapse.

Enforcement of such laws is contingent on provability. Sending money to an offshore bank account is not pseudonymous - even if you do it in person there's a record of your flight, big brother (bankster's best friend) knows where you went and who you talked to. Anyway offshore bank accounts are a privilege enjoyed exclusively by the very wealthy, unlike bitcoin. The example scales down. 
Bitcoin breaks the whole process because ownership fundamentally doesn't apply on the blockchain - only raw access/control, which is not anywhere near close to the same thing as legal ownership. The paradigm is shifted but people haven't realized it so almost everyone is still playing the game by the old rules. 
It'sjust  a matter of time until the bitter wageslaves of the world discover how powerful a tool financial sovereignty is, and when they do it will be the end of this system as we know it, and the birth of something entirely new.

In my example it's more about bitcoin's invisible/ethereal nature. Think about an in-person transaction. For the sake of argument, let's say you're a property-owning debtor in default who is trying to defeat a bank which is suing you attempting to seize your property. A modest suburban house in the USA will go for ~$150,000 USD. 
If you want to conduct an invisible transaction to turn that capturable asset into an uncapturable and secret asset, which would you choose - gold, cash, or bitcoin? Gold's mass makes it completely impractical for this purpose, so that's out. Cash could work, but you better have damn good operational security if you're doing 100k+ private cash deals. Average joe debtor isn't a criminal mastermind, so that's impractical too. There's only bitcoin.

Ironically, this limited definition of "anarchism" ensures that "anarcho"-capitalism is inherently self-refuting. This can be seen from leading "anarcho"-capitalist Murray Rothbard. He thundered against the evil of the state, arguing that it "arrogates to itself a monopoly of force, of ultimate decision-making power, over a given territorial area." In and of itself, this definition is unremarkable. That a few people (an elite of rulers) claim the right to rule others must be part of any sensible definition of the state or government. However, the problems begin for Rothbard when he notes that "[o]bviously, in a free society, Smith has the ultimate decision-making power over his own just property, Jones over his, etc." [The Ethics of Liberty, p. 170 and p. 173] The logical contradiction in this position should be obvious, but not to Rothbard. It shows the power of ideology, the ability of mere words (the expression "private property") to turn the bad ("ultimate decision-making power over a given area") into the good ("ultimate decision-making power over a given area").
Now, this contradiction can be solved in only one way -- the users of the "given area" are also its owners. In other words, a system of possession (or "occupancy and use") as favoured by anarchists. However, Rothbard is a capitalist and supports private property, non-labour income, wage labour, capitalists and landlords. This means that he supports a divergence between ownership and use and this means that this "ultimate decision-making power" extends to those who use, but do not own, such property (i.e. tenants and workers). The statist nature of private property is clearly indicated by Rothbard's words -- the property owner in an "anarcho"-capitalist society possesses the "ultimate decision-making power" over a given area, which is also what the state has currently. Rothbard has, ironically, proved by his own definition that "anarcho"-capitalism is not anarchist.
Of course, it would be churlish to point out that the usual name for a political system in which the owner of a territory is also its ruler is, in fact, monarchy. Which suggests that while "anarcho"-capitalism may be called "anarcho-statism" a far better term could be "anarcho-monarchism." In fact, some "anarcho"-capitalists have made explicit this obvious implication of Rothbard's argument. Hans-Hermann Hoppe is one.
Hoppe prefers monarchy to democracy, considering it the superior system. He argues that the monarch is the private owner of the government -- all the land and other resources are owned by him. Basing himself on Austrian economics (what else?) and its notion of time preference, he concludes that the monarch will, therefore, work to maximise both current income and the total capital value of his estate. Assuming self-interest, his planning horizon will be farsighted and exploitation be far more limited. Democracy, in contrast, is a publicly-owned government and the elected rulers have use of resources for a short period only and not their capital value. In other words, they do not own the country and so will seek to maximise their short-term interests (and the interests of those they think will elect them into office). In contrast, Bakunin stressed that if anarchism rejects democracy it was "hardly in order to reverse it but rather to advance it," in particular to extend it via "the great economic revolution without which every right is but an empty phrase and a trick." He rejected wholeheartedly "the camp of aristocratic . . . reaction." [The Basic Bakunin, p. 87]
However, Hoppe is not a traditional monarchist. His ideal system is one of competing monarchies, a society which is led by a "voluntarily acknowledged 'natural' elite -- a nobilitas naturalis" comprised of "families with long-established records of superior achievement, farsightedness, and exemplary personal conduct." This is because "a few individuals quickly acquire the status of an elite" and their inherent qualities will "more likely than not [be] passed on within a few -- noble -- families." The sole "problem" with traditional monarchies was "with monopoly, not with elites or nobility," in other words the King monopolised the role of judge and their subjects could not turn to other members of the noble class for services. ["The Political Economy of Monarchy and Democracy and the Idea of a Natural Order," pp. 94-121, Journal of Libertarian Studies, vol. 11, no. 2, p. 118 and p. 119]
Which simply confirms the anarchist critique of "anarcho"-capitalism, namely that it is not anarchist. This becomes even more obvious when Hoppe helpfully expands on the reality of "anarcho"-capitalism:
 
"In a covenant concluded among proprietor and community tenants for the purpose of protecting their private property, no such thing as a right to free (unlimited) speech exists, not even to unlimited speech on one's own tenant-property. One may say innumerable things and promote almost any idea under the sun, but naturally no one is permitted to advocate ideas contrary to the very purpose of the covenant of preserving private property, such as democracy and communism. There can be no tolerance towards democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and expelled from society. Likewise in a covenant founded for the purpose of protecting family and kin, there can be no tolerance toward those habitually promoting lifestyles incompatible with this goal. They -- the advocates of alternative, non-family and kin-centred lifestyles such as, for instance, individual hedonism, parasitism, nature-environment worship, homosexuality, or communism -- will have to be physically removed from society, too, if one is to maintain a libertarian order." [Democracy: the God that Failed, p. 218]
Thus the proprietor has power/authority over his tenants and can decree what they can and cannot do, excluding anyone whom they consider as being subversive (in the tenants' own interests, of course). In other words, the autocratic powers of the boss are extended into all aspects of society -- all under the mask of advocating liberty. Sadly, the preservation of property rights destroys liberty for the many (Hoppe states clearly that for the "anarcho"-capitalist the "natural outcome of the voluntary transactions between various private property owners is decidedly non-egalitarian, hierarchical and elitist." ["The Political Economy of Monarchy and Democracy and the Idea of a Natural Order," Op. Cit., p. 118]). Unsurprisingly, Chomsky argued that right-wing "libertarianism" has "no objection to tyranny as long as it is private tyranny." In fact it (like other contemporary ideologies) "reduce[s] to advocacy of one or another form of illegitimate authority, quite often real tyranny." [Chomsky on Anarchism, p. 235 and p. 181] As such, it is hard not to conclude that "anarcho"-capitalism is little more than a play with words. It is not anarchism but a cleverly designed and worded surrogate for elitist, autocratic conservatism. Nor is too difficult to conclude that genuine anarchists and libertarians (of all types) would not be tolerated in this so-called "libertarian social order."

Ownership means the ability to leverage the powers of the state on your behalf to protect your property. You can't always do that on the blockchain, since there isn't always a clear point of attack upon which the violence of the state can be leveraged. For example, if you are duped and you send your btc to the wrong address, held by an pseudonymous agent, you are shit outta luck. All the armies of the world can't help you.

True, but it's mainly Germany (read: German Bankers) and the IMF calling the shots. Scotland has oil so they'll be an important-ish trading partner if/when they drop out of the UK. It's anybody's guess how this could play out, interesting times ahead that's for sure.

Fun fact: No one "owns" any bitcoins, not even Satoshi. 
This is not simply a matter of semantics, either, it's a matter of understanding the fundamentals of blockchain technology. With bitcoin there is only access / non-access, or control / non-control.

That's not ironic at all. The same mentality that has one selfishly printing money at this scale (thereby stealing wealth from all other holders of your currency) seeks to preserve that stolen wealth by discouraging others from doing the same (counterfeiting).
Ironic would be if there *hadn't been any anti-counterfeit measures at all* because they knew it didn't matter anymore. One would expect anti-counterfeit measures, that is the normal state of affairs.
**Ironic** - a state of affairs or an event that seems *deliberately contrary to what one expects* and is often amusing as a result. The hyperinflated currency was not deliberate, but a side-effect of their actions to create wealth for themselves by stealing it from everyone else in their nation.

It's not. Ownership is a legal distinction, backed by an elaborate system of laws, which are in turn backed by legitimized violence, kidnapping, and dungeons.
Control of keys on the blockchain is not connected to that system directly in the same way as property. 
The blockchain is not backed by violence, and bitcoin's value is not artificially inflated by coercion like national fiat scrip.

One more thing, of all the awful shit that governments and corporations around the world have done to the masses in the 21st century, *this* is the straw that breaks the Orwellian Camel's back? **Really** OP? 
It wasn't warrantless wiretapping, Facebook snooping on non-users, FBI cracking iPhone encryption, wikileaks many  revelations, the Panana papers, Hilary Clintons off-limits private server, the British right's hijacking of political power getting brexit vote and then promptly stepping down in disgrace, or **remote-operated murderdrones** in the skies of sovereign nations?
