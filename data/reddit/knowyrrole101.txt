will get behhcunnecked

no the btc is used to drive the price down...they sell the btc.. price crashes when heavy sell orders keep cascasing down...they use tether to buy back up on the cheap. They essentially are taking all the liquidity out of the market and running away with it.

In the document they provided it explicitly states its not an audit...it's a "memo". No fucking way would they go on record and say its a full audit they put themselves at major risk by doing so.  
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:58:54
lol this is way over your head...their fees are literally minuscule compared to the impact there tether printing has had on the overall market. 
Hey it’s cool though I’m sure they have 1.7B in the bank rofl that’s backed 1:1. Let me know when they start printing more tether per day than the US fed. Technically they around 60% there. Either way keep holding I’ll make sure to take my tinfoil hat and put it on you when your money gets completely swiped from under you. You idiots clearly don’t understand the obvious economic plunder going on here. 
I mean since crypto is going to the Moon why does it matter if I “fud” there’s entry points to profit everyday right? Guaranteed profits right? 
What would I know though I Only have been working on building products in the programmatic commodities and equity markets for 12 years. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:13:40
LOL that's good enough for you. Oh man...fuck you guys are going to get behhhconnecked so bad rofl. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:21:13
Nevermind the fact that the prices are rising 10%-15% in minutes over the course of a 15 green candles as soon as they start dropping
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:43:19
paid for? lol you dont know they were paid for 
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:09:45
or $1B since dec 20th...rofl...god damn it's like these crypto economists in here don't want to know the dick is about to be in their asses until it penetrates...even though they see it getting lubed up behind them 
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:41:38
Lol I can buy 50 million of pure BTC with usdt and drive up the market cap by more than my 50 million purchase. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:44:04
i dont believe this will destroy the market either but hurt for a while...it will stay above a few k i believe...btc is here to stay we just need to get rid of the corruption and fraud from this ecosystem
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:03:00
ideally yes but they have infected the market by pumping it so full of fake tether the prices of all coins are probably significantly overinflated
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:19:52
650 Million injections when the price is down from its previous highs? Wouldnt the price increase way over our previous highs if 650 new dollars flowed into bitcoin.  I understand the lack of liquidity is a problem and they tried to find solutions...but it turned from a solution to just straight tetheral reserve...they haven't submitted to one full audit. Get real man

doesnt everyone hhahahaha me and my buddy were trying to mine it back in 2013 but there was less available resources on how to do so and wasnt sure if it was gpu/cpu mineable back then
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:34:18
how is that....
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:13:38
yeah i get that feeling too...finex/tether situation playing out will be a good proxy for the future if it could withstand a finex collapse btc is most certainly going to moon...
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:54:41
Ah it said they plan on regulation not banning 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:52:25
dont worry bud BTC has a long way to go up...more money to be made hopefully...just hodl and forget about it. I trusted rumors and sold off btc 2 weeks ago at $10k and it rose to $13k lol granted it wasnt a loss but 30% gains that will not be realized through...rumor. Hold and trust your gut. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:36:10
to alot of people that bought high...if your worried...try dollar cost averaging down...buy on the dips down so that you can be profitable a lower target than say $16-$17k
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:39:34
crazy if we really think that show will get people to adopt btc...lol....sorry but that is just not a good thing. Now financial markets setting up etfs and futures now thats interesting
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:38:24
honestly i wouldnt recommend older people invest...not to talk shit...but when you get older your risk tolerance has to be lower to protect your nest egg...as it bitcoin matures mainstream it will gain adoption from older markets....how many people even understand what half of their retirement portfolio distribution even looks like tbh 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:51:59
the noobs gotta be freaking out feel bad...picked up some serious cash on bcc back into btc...lol fuck coinbase...glad i always keep in paper wallet or bittrex...pretty reliable overall. Coinbase is trash. Fucking treat your customers well. Downtime during a fucking crash jeez man...btc recouped a lot of losses though howevering around $9.7k on trex. You guys will be fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:23:31
lololololol we all think we're mega pros haha...im not really shit but I do hope btc hits $100k :) 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:53:00
Alt trading will be all the rage then....it will finally be feasible with a stable BTC as a baseline currency. I regularly get bagged trading alts lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:03:37
Kat I strongly recommend learning how to read charts..and only really day trading alts. If your looking for holding strategy you’re in the right positions. You can use a bot or manually find buy in points. Alts are way too risky to hold tbh especially for someone newer to crypto. Stick to eth , monero, dash, ltc, and btc In my opinion for holding.

$460k prop tax bill would equate to a $20-40 million home assuming 1-2% prop tax rate. Thats a pretty hefty bill right there. Wonder how much charlie lee made selling all his LTC rofl.
