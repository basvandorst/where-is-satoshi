I hate to break this to you but this is an obvious scam. Had it been real I would've donated in a heartbeat.

Inclined to agree, although it could be an honest mistake. But it's suspect that someone interested in Ukraine's present and future would be so ignorant of the meaning of this mistake. "The Ukraine", simply put, means "The Borderland (of Russia)" putting it inside Russia, while "Ukraine" is the actual name of the country since independence. It's a bit like asking for donations for the plight of the people of Rhodesia.
Edit: Okay yeah, no, it's been an hour since your post, no reply while they are active mentioning some hackaton ("confirmed" by new and throwaway accounts). No correction of the mistake, which they obviously don't know or care about. No one supposedly involved (from Bitcoin Foundation) is willing to back it up, and the OP uses to excuses to cover for the delays. Now I'm definitely leaning towards scam.

Don't worry, even if you donate, IT IS A SCAM, so your coins will merely go to A SCAMMER.

Of course not IT IS A SCAM.

I would just like to say that it is absolutely despicable of you to create this scam over the backs of the Ukrainian people. That is all.
PLEASE, people, do not fall for this SCAM. It is clever social engineering, and going by the specifics of how they went about it using a fake website, numerous fake accounts, dodging important questions, they even got THE NAME OF UKRAINE WRONG, it's very hard not to be left with the distinct impression that this is a blatant scam.
Of course, had it been real these fears could've easily been assuaged in the day since it's been posted, but don't hold your breath.
OBVIOUS SCAM IS OBVIOUS

So almost a day later nothing happened, you keep dodging questions, you don't even care you spelled the name of the country wrong.
Fuck you, scammer.
OBVIOUS SCAM IS OBVIOUS

How does a scam beat something real?

Claims? No, the [CIA *actually did that* to fund their paramilitary terror campaign]( against the harmless democratically elected Sandinistas in Nicaragua. They couldn't fund paramilitary terrorists (the Contras) directly, so instead they smuggled huge amounts of cocaine into the US in exchange for weapons. Then they sold more weapons to Iran so they could get more weapons for the Contras, who went on to massacre tens of thousands of civilians.
But in fairness, the CIA learned their lesson there, after the whole thing blew up in their faces. And now they leave the international drugs trade [to the banks that run it]( in the first place.

You won't give a bitcent to a single Ukrainian, BECAUSE YOU ARE A SCAMMER.

Sean please don't fall for this obvious scam, please read some of the comments and the legitimate questions people have about this SCAM, such as not even getting the name of Ukraine right, no one willing to vouch for it (except reddit accounts), all the lame excuses, etc.
@_date: 2014-03-02 11:00:52
Why is this SCAM still not deleted?
@_date: 2015-03-23 08:28:39
This is actually good news.
