So if I am understanding correctly, the Bcash protocol let you transfer funds from a bcash wallet to a bitcoin wallet? ..and thats a problem I guess.

What was the main point of the man talking in the clip? What does he thinks people will mainly use bitcoin in Venezuela?
I am a Venezuelan living abroad and use bitcoin mainly to send money to my family there. I also know that people is using bitcoin to change the local currency for bitcoin aswell so they can avoid the inflation eating their money. 
I have a hard time trying to imagine average venezuelans adopting the use of cryptocurrencies. There aren't that much people with technical knowledge for a bitcoinization to take place, I don't think is impossible but a very difficult situation to happen

Don't trust that google converter for the price relation of Bolivars and Dollars. Thats the price set by the goverment which 99% of the population don't have access to it. In the black market the price of 1 $ is 30000 Bolivars.

Someone who needs to buy a house, a car or a property. There are a lot of people selling their properties at a low value so they can move out of the country with their families and start again.

Day traders. Everybody wins on this transaction. They sell high, people get rid of their bolivars.
