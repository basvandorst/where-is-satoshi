That doesn't mean he pays 86 million less in taxes. It means when determining how much he has to pay in taxes, they will say his income was 86 million less. Put another way, if you gave away half your income to charity, you would still have to pay taxes on the first half of your income, and OP will still have to pay taxes on all the dollars he exchanges his bitcoin for that are not part of those 86 million charity bound dollars.
So if OP follows through on this, that's wonderful, and an actual sacrifice.

For sure. I only have two hundred dollars or so in coins. That's bread crumbs to most regulars on this sub, but it's all I can lose (or even lock up) for now without it affecting my life. I'll start putting in more as I can after Christmas, but I'm still very new to all this.

So I have a question. I don't have too much money in bitcoin, but it's all I feel I can put in without an expectation of getting it back soon.
But what, long term, is the reason to think Bitcoin will always dominate all the alt coins? Sure, the really high transaction fees and times may go down in time, but what sets bitcoin apart from all the new coins? Is it just that it was first and so will always win by default? I would imagine once crypto currencies become ubiquitous the ones with the most practical use would win. And right now at least, Bitcoin doesn't seem to be it.

A few weeks back I sent some BTC to myself with a very low fee attached, because I wasn't in any hurry to send it anywhere else. It may have been *too* low a fee.
I wonder if/when I'll get it. Only 0.009 BTC, but that's a significant amount of money to me.
It does make it easier to hodl, though.

Watching all my alt coins crash and burn on Binance (which measures everything in % change relative to bitcoin) is no fun... *But what if I move them all to bitcoin and then it crashes?*
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:16:09
That's temporary. I know nothing about XRB, and can't say whether it looks promising or not, but either BTC will continue to be developed until it is once again the most useful/practical of the crypto currencies, or some other coin(s) will overtake it in time. Might take a year, might take 20, but right now BTC is the giant because it was first. I'm still pretty new to all this, and mostly hold BTC, Iota and Litecoin (and not that much of any of them), but I expect the cocktail will change as I continue to learn and new coins develop and come to my attention.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:24:33
That's great. I dislike the large banks a lot, and am pleased that you have found a way to cut them out of your life. That is not the norm, however, and transaction fees are ridiculously high for bitcoin at the moment. I think crypto currency is here to stay, but so far there's a lot of unfulfilled potential.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:30:33
I bought 50 Euro's worth in October because I was curious about buying stuff on the Dark Net. Decided against it, but at that point I already had 0.009 bitcoin, and I started casually paying attention to it. Then crypto coins in general.
This may come as a great surprise to everyone who frequents this sub, but I now wish I had bought more than 0.009 in October.
That said, yeah, the usefulness of crypto coins at the moment is limited to buying illegal shit online or hiding transactions from the government. That's it. That's all it can do. All the great fancy paradigm shifty things are still decidedly in the future, and most currently popular coins may well be dead by the time that changes.

Those who 'create' wealth couldn't do shit without society. They need a customer base, they need utilities, infrastructure, an education. You don't get to reap the benefits of those things and then turn around and say that you don't owe anyone else for your success.

I've been here for two months. There's a lot to learn for new people, and I'm still very much one of the new. One of those unconfirmed transactions is mine. Three weeks ago I told myself "The fee is too high! I'm not in any hurry, so I'll set a really low fee and just wait a day or two!" Still waiting on that one. :p I guess I'll be waiting for quite a while.
It *does* make hodling a lot easier, since I can't touch my BTC on either end.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:57:51
Hah! Same here! ...Except I only got into it two months ago.
If only I had been curious about illegally buying LSD half a decade earlier!

For Europeans, if you verify your account on Pitpanda you can then pay with your debit/credit card and purchase with no delay.

Yeah, chuck sounds like a looney. I'm Swedish. Life isn't perfect, but I've been to the US for a friend's wedding, and the inequality and poverty is horrible.

Then why this comment? And couldn't someone make any number of accounts and keep only a small portion of their coins on any one account?
@_date: 2017-02-08 14:10:10
So as an outsider who hasn't looked very deeply into Bitcoin... I keep seeing comments about how it's difficult to track where bitcoins come from and how much someone has. So... they make it a lot easier for criminals to move large sums of money around, and for otherwise law abiding people to hide money from the government. Is that accurate? If so, do you think that's a good thing, and if not is that's going to change? Because it seems like a pretty big flaw to me.
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:58:41
Sure it does, but it's a little impractical to hide large stacks of cash and to make large purchases with them.
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:06:09
Kind of impractical to have huge stacks of cash lying around or use them to buy anything.
I came here looking arguments to help me understand Bitcoin better, not for some idiot to just spew insults and rail about how scary government is.
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:44:32
The people who benefit the most from the ability to hide cashflow are criminals. It also makes tax evasion much easier. Is that good too?
@_date: 2019-06-23 15:03:18
Are the wings good though? We don't have Hooters here in Sweden.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:09:50
Newbies unite! ^^In ^^^fear ^^^^and ^^^^^inaction. I have 9 milibitcoin. That's not going to do much either way, but I'm finding everything to do with cryptocurrency more interesting since I got them a few weeks back. 
@_date: 2019-12-22 07:14:13
So, help me understand something here. If you have an old seed written down with some Bitcoin on it, and only you know you have that seed, and you don't have a wallet installed on your computer or phone, and you are quite content to just hold for a long time yet... Should you still order a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:21:30
Thanks. This all sounds very interesting. I'm new to all this, and there's rather a lot to take in.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:19:47
I'm still pretty new to crypto currencies, and only have a little bitcoin. Could you explain what it is that makes bcash bad/vulnerable in a way that most crypto currencies aren't? The 'could be destroyed at any moment' part sounds like an instant deal killer.
@_date: 2018-03-03 10:11:16
Ha. I sat by and watched crypto for a while before I decided to put money into it, and you only really hear about exchanges when things go wrong, so I was expecting it all to take weeks of frustration. So 'fast and painless' is pretty high praise, I think. Although if I'd been in marketing I would probably have found a way to sneak in a referral link. :p
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:39:39
How many Bitcoin will be released? And do we know to how many people?
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:22:22
Thanks! It appears to have dropped a bit since then. :p But eh, I didn't put much money in yet. I just wanted to get in and watch it up close. I'm still learning the basics.
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:46:17
I used Bitpanda. They were very fast and painless back in October. Have not used them since then, but should still be good. Do note that you can't buy any coins until you have shown them your face and ID.

Well, I finally decided to give this a go. I got my first wallet yesterday, and today I finally managed to buy some bitcoin (milibitcoin? What even is the generic term?) from one of the recommended sites. Now I'm just waiting for the news that Equifax owns bitpanda and that all their user data has been hacked. Until then, however, I find myself cautiously optimistic and curious as to where this all is headed.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:35:59
I used bitpanda. There is an (I think) rather high fee for transferring my bitcoin from there to my wallet on Electrum. Is it standard practise that it costs 3-4 dollars to transfer funds, or is that a high cost bitpanda takes to make money, and most transfers from wallet to wallet are lower?
