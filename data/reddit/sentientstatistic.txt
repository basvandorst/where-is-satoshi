That's true but I get taxed on state lotto winnings, on penny stocks (which generally are as risky and unpredictable as most crypto out there) and I wouldn't see crypto currency being any different. You don't only claim gains when you sell stocks/buy stocks. You do it at the end of the tax year, too, on your gains--to my understanding.

Thanks for the knowledge friendo

Dividends and capital gains on stocks/funds/etc.

I get taxes sent from Fidelity for my gains, despite not selling that I *have* to claim taxes on unless it's in my IRA.

I'm not sure at all why it'd be taxed or not taxed but it seems like an investment that appreciates or depreciates and it's not a retirement account so you have to pay taxes on it right away?

Are you sure? In my tax info that I get sent yearly, my appreciation is on it, too and if I recall correctly, I enter it on my tax forms, but we have a tax preparer on payroll so idk for certain

Thanks mister straw man argument. English is my third language, and when I smoke weed I get a bit difficult to articulate my meaning. 
Great added value, though! /s

That’s stupid. Are you relatively unscathed compared to the thousands of people dying across the planet each day? Yeah you are. Do you go around describing yourself that way? Not unless you’re a moron right 
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:36:49
Lol. 
Unscathed is an understatement. Bitcoin is back at last week of Nov/ first week of Dec prices. Ethereum has doubled that. What’s up your butt bro?
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:16:44
One might say it’s even older than Bitcoin itself...

Damn, I suppose I can block you and never see your time wasting response to this post since we can all talk out of our asses and just waste each other’s unretrievable time for absolute nonsense. But I’m gonna block you and save myself from seeing such garbage. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:21:25
Any examples?
Downvoted because someone said something and I asked for one instance of it? Classic Reddit.

Literally the depth of most people’s character when their gibberish claims don’t stand 
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:04:20
Nope.

Congratulations? Bitcoin is back at the pre-mass-hysteria prices and Ethereum is cruising. Sure it went to 1,400 but look at how many shit coins have lost over 80% worth since that time. The market was over saturated. Those aggressive swings aren’t relevant for those looking at wtf is going on longer term than meme money. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:15:15
Lol. Do you even Crypto, bro?
Around early December: 
Bitcoin was around $10k. 
Ethereum around $450-$480
Bitcoin is around the same. Ethereum has doubled. 
Jk about the do you even crypto comment. I’m sure you do. But just wanted to point ETH isn’t “unscathed”, it’s been doing relatively great.

We thought better memes would get us better ATH’s ;_;

I hope if someone is that talented and up to date on the world, they don’t waste their talent away for some upvotes. Unless they like the Reddit community and want to express themselves in it but idk how many of those people make great stuff or put time into it *for* Reddit.
