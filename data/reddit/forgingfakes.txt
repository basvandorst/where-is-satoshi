Could have had AA or Richard Heart up there checking his ass. 
Kind of a big deal that the wife of a BCash group was responsible for giving Ver a podium

Errr... time to start hedging with the cheap gold?

If they blacklist addressed and then blacklist any downstream addresses as well... this essentially censors bitcoin doesnt it?
Govt threatens miners to comply with their blacklists or they freeze their fiat funds. Miners are forced to comply or are starved from fiat or are blacklisted as well.
It doesn't seem too complicated

Warn mining pools that if they include blacklisted addresses, it will put their banks in jeopardy. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:38:24
They wont need to change the protocol though right?
Just say that any wallets that transact with any of the blacklisted wallets will be blacklisted as well.
The blacklist will essentially bar your transactions from fiat gateways

I want to be clear, I'm a maximalist. But the idea that addresses can be blacklisted from fiat sources is scary.
Miners still need access to legacy systems. I think this is something to watch closely. As I believe it will become a bigger deal as the blacklists grow.
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:34:29
No, but what if blacklisted wallets and exchanges are cut off from banks via blacklists?

Also makes me wonder if it's just an Avenue for whales to sell off their huge bags at a premium price

It would just be maintaining a separate ledger no?
Also, mixers can be disseminated as well. I hear they're not really reliable for anonymity. A friend of mine said he has reliable info that mixers are actually maintained now by intelligence services. Dunno how much to put behind it, but if you can gather the inputs and outputs of mixers, it's not too difficult to track bitcoins 
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:35:31
This is assuming your wallet isnt blacklisted. Once it is, any adjoining wallets down chain will be blacklisted as well.

What's going to stop new coins from air dropping and essentially creating vulnerabilities in bitcoin?
How many wallets were available to access the airdrop? 1? How easy would it have been to make this malicious in the future?
