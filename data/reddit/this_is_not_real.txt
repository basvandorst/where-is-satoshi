So the dream of buying through paypal a dying?

Look I just need to know where I can get about $200 of BTC.  I'd prefer to do it online but whatever, if you can help me out I'll do whatever it takes.  Some kind girl did it over paypal for me the other day and it worked out perfect.

This is what I get typically when I sign up on typical pay sites: "Unfortunately we are not able to provide financial services to USA residents due to bank restrictions at the moment.

What sites can Americans use that will get me more value for my buck??  I've tried a few who do not accept American cards or currency.  It's very frustrating.

I don't mind meeting with the cash, but I wouldn't know a good bargain anymore because the prices are always fluctuation and I don't have tons of extra money.

i Really want to order some bottles of mushroom juice, but I just can't find a good BTC price.  It's driving me nuts.  Now I know I could just buy regular spores but I really want to try to the juices.  I've heard excellent things.

I'm not interested in doing a charge pack... just looking for a fair price.  I want the coins.  I don't want to screw good people over.  I just need it for my meds.

I notice both of these sites require cash locally... is the no play to buy them online?

I no longer know a damn soul in my area that can get me mushrooms or the extracts... just xanax bars and I honestly need to take a break from them,
@_date: 2016-01-30 19:37:04
