Well I can see it from one side of verification as you'd be the only one to know (if you have a good memory and can remember every singled signup you ever had in life without needing an email).
However, I cannot do that and I do not have the email anymore. But they are very persistent on this and require it from me, but I really have no idea and they are just pushy on the subject of it.
I prefer BlockChain.info at the moment since they also show you what your balance is worth but that's just a common wallet.

Go ahead, I was frustrated by the way people charge such premiums for currency. His excuse to me was that he bought them cheaper elsewhere, so thought it would be fine to overcharge them to make his money back! He never states that in his profile!

Nope, no Xapo logo. The card just says My Choice on it with this funny grey swirly image in the background of the card which is black.
@_date: 2014-07-28 10:39:55
The reason why companies go this route is because it is the cheapest option as opposed to other alternatives, when I worked in Debt Collection they always forced us to get payments via Direct Debit as it was the cheapest option and it was guaranteed to wirthdraw from the customers account.
@_date: 2014-08-12 04:02:44
I would of liked something that had Xapo on it, I originally thought the image they showed on their website was going to be the card they had sent out with the branding name, it would be a lot cooler if it actually came out that way, but sadly - it seems that idea didn't come to play. For me a card is a card, but I am all about brand awareness, if someone asked me about the card I would be like it is from Xapo, but they'd probably look at me funny!

It definitely is not other malware on my PC - I just did a fresh format so it is definitely not that. I did download several copies and main site and other sources and all are the same, or give the same results.
Malwarebytes could be detecting this as a false positive but I do use Norton Internet Security and it's not detecting anything.

Currently I am staying in L.A, I live in Melbourne though and I know or have hear in fact there is an ATM in the Melbourne CBD that I want to check out when I get back home - I doubt there is one here in L.A, not in the direct city just in the outer burbs so I would assume not.
Thank you for the links above it is helpful I will have to check them out and see, for me Credit Card transactions are just easy overall and I don't file chargebacks unless they are really necessary - though anyone could say this at the end of the day.
@_date: 2014-07-21 10:39:21
I downloaded this directly from Multi-Bit that was the thing... I will check the download that I have shortly, though I do not believe it has an exploit but Malwarebytes surely says something is going on.
Checking on these now.

Why...? 1BTC is like $654 when CoinJar is only $594, how is that better?
@_date: 2014-07-28 13:01:42
I ain't saying this is a bad thing by any means. This could be good news for some and bad news for others, I lost $900 back in the day for a lost .dat wallet file which was really bad but a good downwards spiral will help in terms of buying more in BTC - I started my journey when the value was just climbing in to the high $100's and it shot up from there - my investment turned out pretty good till I was stupid and didn't save my .dat file properly.
You could be right about the sanctions, Russia has had a tough time with these and it all be political and all, I can see this playing a part in it's volatile downwards state.
I am not a BitCoin expert but I've been following it's course over time and the coin has held up well, I just wish that places like CoinJar didn't take advantage of it's value and increase it nearly $10 more than BitStamp values.
@_date: 2014-07-31 05:52:27
Maybe wait for CoinJar's Swipe Card.

Honestly I've seen enough of MasterCard already.
@_date: 2014-07-15 21:52:26
Yes, I actually had the same type of issue. I was sending money back to CoinJar and it said there was a FEE, it never said how much. I tried low amounts and it still failed to send out but I did eventually get it to send after I had gotten all the verification done on my account (well just the phone number) but that was before the fact anyways so there was still issues even after that.
They've a good concept I agree with you on that, however, their customer support and stuff like the so aren't as good to what one would be expecting.
Funny they finally did get back to me after 7 days, but their slow support has really turned me off them now.
@_date: 2014-07-28 13:45:52
 Since the massive drop it has been fairly stable, has it's moments but it's slowly getting down there.
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:28:29
You have a point, I do work in system security as well and you should never underestimate code because it can be tricky and easily exploitable. For instance there are tools available at the moment that can exploit a database on Wordpress (I am keeping it under wraps) for the time being since it could be a very big risk. I have tested this on one of my own personal Wordpress blogs &amp; it was easily obtaining information about my users/passwords/emails/billing &amp; other related information.
Though with regards to Ryan, it is what was news back a while ago that I had read about and it got me concerned.
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:12:36

The good thing about my bank is they have a Lock n Limit feature where you can turn of INT funds at online shops and ATM's. Carding a Card usually involves the use of websites or Western Union, so I think a feature like this with your bank could of helped where you choose as the customer to allow your card to be used INT or not.

May as well start selling them online, chances are the rates would be crappy on the ATM - more than likely, I want my money worth - not some crap exchange rate value. It is a good idea on the ATM, though I don't think they will be as successful.

I just had the Bitcoin-qt wallet and an address that I sent it too. There I do not know if there was any private keys, I read online that all that we needed to do was save the wallet.dat and restore it and it would return the Bitcoin address to normal.

It is actually Windows 7, knowing me I am a little technical but don't call me genius. I tried Recuva, I even tried Tenorshare, none of which would recover any wallet.dat file from the day prior to February 4. It kept repeating the file on every single recovery. Mind you, the restore did pick up older .dat files from November last year but it held nothing but words and was damaged (as to what bitcoin-qt) was telling me. I did read that once you overwrite that file, it will make it next to impossible to recover it again since you have already overwritten it on the disk :(
@_date: 2014-07-15 21:22:03
I had the same thought myself, I questioned it in another topic sometime ago but live, learn, forget. I did read about this though so it makes you question it a little.
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:15:28
You may as well classify it that way, a sale goes through the general rig-ma-roll of the general sale/auction, I wonder if they pay agent fees on these. You would hate to sell your house and the price of bitcoin plummets 50% or more - you'd essentially be giving the house away for free.
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:33:40
I have the files but I think it was just a bunch of words like "Access Denied" and "Error setting security on machine\software\classes.", that list goes on and on and on...
I could try and recover again though I doubt I will get anywhere with it since the files are nothing but words and no real means behind them.
I think I have tried 5 different recovery applications now, from strong to weak, the wallet.dat file I saved as Sean.dat to my desktop, I recovered that at 0 bytes - though nothing I can do with a 0 byte file - the wallet was not encrypted it was simply open with no attached passwords, I thought screw it I will keep this on my PC instead as I wanted it out of the online wallet (Biggest mistake of 2014).

This is true, it is what I do. But at the end of the day it is a site of simply high premiums, people on Bitcointalk have no issue selling at rates of less than 10% but people have the hide at Localbitcoins to sell at rates of 50% and more for no real cause. 
I take you are a Localbitcoins dealer, would make sense.

Actually not quite true. You can use VirWox if you want to buy them but the downside of this is that the conversion is the part that sucks you can lose up to $30 on $100 so not really worth it - just the only one I know of but avoid.
@_date: 2014-08-12 03:43:20
Would you believe it does not mention Xapo once not even on the letter. At the top right it says My Choice, 12 Tuckneys Lane, Suite 2B - GX111AA.
Otherwise the rest of the letter just says to keep it secure, call this number and activate and then visit  to view details.
I am not sure, I think if I send money to my Xapo wallet, it will sit in the account as AUD, but will then convert using USD and then use a conversion of 3% after that.
Expensive little card, I think worse than my AMEX :D
@_date: 2014-07-21 10:43:05
I have tested the one I have from the site: 
It is safe, but then again Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit is still in Beta so it could be simply a false positive.
I just want to make sure since I have had BTC stolen before and I do not want to risk my information being captured again.

@_date: 2014-07-28 10:37:14
I will agree as of the moment the price is $576 on Bitstamp and CoinJar is $10 more... Don't get it, all other exchanges are less.

I would not trust anything  writes, they do not like truth, also deleted my comments as well, shady practices by them.
@_date: 2014-08-03 00:19:05
Localbitcoins is OK, but be careful some of the users set percentages way too high. I bought $336 USD worth and got $170 back worth of BTC - always check before dealing as some are just there with exorbitant fees.
Since I am in Australia, I use places like CoinJar, I BPAY them and my funds appear in my filler account the following day, there I can then buy my BTC. 
You can always check places like Bitcointalk.org, they have a Currency Exchange section which people buy/sell via different methods, beware though scammers galore.
@_date: 2014-07-21 22:43:20
Since having it, it is the only thing it has blocked as an exploit. I downloaded other wallets to test and it did not block any of those ones, it could be the big false positive as I said but when you use BitCoins I wouldn't want them to be compromised.

@_date: 2014-08-07 05:30:14
I do not work for them :) 
When I read the vault policy at the beginning, without reading their TOS, when I first signed up, I got the same impression about this being 100% secured, I mean, they claim to have it on cold storage with no internet access so I do not see why they are not insuring the entire balance we place in there?
@_date: 2014-07-22 22:43:16
I signed up but OF COURSE it isn't available in my area, more like information grabbing if you were to ask me.

So you are saying if I was to purchase $500 via my Credit Card that it would most definitely be in a wallet on your site or to an address I propose? (Instantly) or within minutes?
Do you have a current stock of bitcoins as I have been after something like this for a while, but I don't to waste money on buying BTC from a lunatic on a pogo stick!!

Sure, I have run my own successful businesses in the past but offering $0.03 as an incentive to refer isn't really "amazing" in a consumers eye. If you are wanting to drum up business for your new product/service then I'd look at how other businesses are operating, finding out their incentives and try and work with the competition. I've since stopped referring cause there is absolutely no incentive for me.

* Monthly service fee in comparison to my own bank is $4 AUD, reverse that if you have $2000/m hitting your bank account (FAIR).
* Add money, (FAIR)
* Get Cash, (REASONABLE) I have Neteller also and they charge $6 per withdrawal no matter where you are or what currency you use.
* Declined Transactions, the whole point of a decline. (UNFAIR)
* Spend Money (FAIR), though the conversion for INT customers is reluctantly (UNFAIR) since we have our currency already set in our accounts. If that's the case have one currency only.
* Information: (REASONABLE) but costing to check a balance is silly.
* Other: (UNFAIR) Banks don't even charge for PIN change, replacement cards vary per vendor so I think this is (FAIR), Expedited Card (OUTRAGEOUS) ... Redemption of Unused Funds??

I was in the USA for 3 months, April through to July. I was amazed at how FAR behind the USA was compared to Australia in terms of banking and technology.
One thing I noticed, the bank costs were very high, well above Australian standards, internet banking again was behind the times.
Australia is at the point where you can use mobile phones or US (cell phones) to make purchases at Eftpos machines (or terminals) where this was lacking in the USA.
We recently introduced cashless banking where you can now withdrawal cash with your mobile phone if you forgot your credit/debit cards where again the USA lacked this.
I went to Vons, there checkout's again were outdated, where Australia has touch screen technology Vons did not have this.
Australia is all about tap and pay where the USA is not seen to be heavily engaged in this, just remain behind the old schemes of swiping their cards.
I can understand why Xapo isn't ready for the US market.

I get confused, is it the COO Ryan Zhou because these Asian names always try to replicate English names and it's always confusing to who is who.
I think it is though, from this page:  to this page:  with the same Zhou I would think it is the same guy - heaps of threads on Reddit but I think it is a mystery solved without any further research.
CoinJar has survived for a while from what I've seen, there VERY VERY strict on the simplest things, well overboard in my opinion and have gone through some hurdles, some things I would like to see improved on their site and services to which are a tad confusing for consumers.
Overall, good site, little complicated, and a little too far overboard on security.

You'll find it extremely hard I am afraid, most people won't accept PayPal since the funds are easily reversible to where BTC are not.

I am not sure where about in Melbourne physically. However, I normally purchase mine via  or via  the benefit of iGot is that you can do direct transfers from Commonwealth Bank, Bank SA, and St George. I personally use the Commonwealth Bank to do mine and it's quicker than BPAY in most instances.
The thing they don't advertise or they don't tell you is that even though you are  buying at 0% you are still given less bitcoin, I spent around $2,400.00 and ended up with $50.00 less in value of the Bitcoin amount. Still, they are a good alternative and they do have a BPAY option as well.
Coinjar is nice, you should signup with them as they were a Melbourne based company and they also accept Bitcoin and they also have a Debit Card that you can obtain as well and I believe it is with the Heritage Bank, they just don't tell you that :) They have a 1% buy in and a 2% sell off, when you consider the variances with iGot there isn't much of a difference in the value you will receive.
Really depends on what options you want to take but they are my two options, iGot takes at least 7 days before you can withdraw bitcoin and you need to prove your identity with a Passport photo and what not, with Coinjar they use a more streamline process something like Green Identity where you can get verified within minutes by using your Medicare number as well as your drivers license, and/or your electoral roll details.
Happy hunting!
P.S - You could use Localbitcoins, I'd advise against it though.
P.S - I assume you live in Clayton by the username, I am out Glen Iris :)

Ah, don't be so quick to judge me boy :)
Last year I invested $200 in to BTC, the value was later at $900, then I lost my .dat file and haven't been able to retrieve the 1.19 BTC - so I have lost a small fortune in those early day investments :( It is surely going to take me years to make that back in lost Bitcoins. However, time will tell how things will eventuate and hopefully for the better.

More to Australia would be pretty slick also.... There is like 1 or 2 here in Melbourne (that I am aware of) maps says there is 7, shall check them out!!!

The torture still haunts me. It's quite annoying how it returns!

This is why I enjoy the Commonwealth Bank, I can transfer money between any account such as my parents, siblings, friends, and it goes instantly :D
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:14:17
I bought in just before it went down, hoping a rise would come to $300, I was a bit bullish and bought in too soon. Just lost $600 so far.
@_date: 2015-03-14 06:21:12
Feel the pain, I formatted my desktop last year and lost 1BTC, at the time it was worth $900 now it's worth $400, however, I lost my .dat file and could never replicate it, I can still see where my bitcoins are, I just can't access or retrieve them. As one said they are technically still there you just can't access them.
Unless you can retrieve that same .dat file then you are technically shit out of luck I'm afraid, I feel your pain of it all as I do miss my 1.19 BTC! May not seem like much as of yet but if Bitcoin was to suddenly rise I'd be kicking myself with it's good value.
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:51:00
Good Luck I suppose.

How can a "consumer" outside Bitcoin adopt it when it's a shaky market, has a lot of internet threats, and you can lose your life savings with a simple hack. There has to be some form of consumer protection before it will become as widely adopted as banks.

I did manage to get mine to work with Neteller Debit Card, however, I was locked out of my account and no other cards are working for me in Australia :(

With "anything" growth takes time, think about shares they are similar, you hold on to them as a long term investment and hope for sakes the values increase on those shares and it can take years upon years to see any real dollars come from it. Never expect exponential growth in a matter of days/weeks - however, in the case of bitcoin there could be an exception to the rule.
@_date: 2015-03-12 13:04:50
I love Bitcoin, this could be a good thing :)
@_date: 2015-03-16 07:42:34
Our Government condoned it as a Commodity so we had to pay GST on the buying of BTC which is 10% - kick in the pants, Coinjar.com moved from AUS to the UK because of the change.

Or just by typing the key words will suffice without being too technical about it. :)

I am waiting on the perfect time to spend $2,400.00 AUD on Bitcoin. Waiting on the best price before I proceed.

Yeah, no! Won't be getting my business, looks phishy enough.

Seems pointless if you ask me, I'd do anything myself to get some Satoshi's but we are all in the same vote, one thing I dislike is referrals.

Circle has a new option for a Drivers License and/or Passport, this is new to me, will it stop our accounts from being closed for review?

I never trust anyone but myself with my Bitcoins. Essentially it's money, the only person we all seem to put some trust into is the financial network (banks). I saw another thread about this service and no one had even heard of them, I never had that was for sure.

That is so generous of you hehe!!

The service is a playground for *scammers* and I've lost over $100 due to dodgy people with good ratings, I just wish they'd RIP already.
@_date: 2015-03-21 03:16:51
Agreed. I either convert it to use on my Debit Card with Coinjar.com, or I will simply withdraw it straight to my bank account and get hit with 2% - seems pointless to convert it to PayPal.

Can't say I'd trust the website at all. Domain was registered like a day or two ago, I'd be careful to everyone.

Correct, Rome was never built in a day and we neither has Bitcoin. Growth will take time, Bitcoin needs to establish itself more, I would anticipate the $300 will hit the mark soon and possibly within the next week or two.

I was attached to the game, like any game though you only ever play it for so long before you give up playing it. I think the issue with games giving out Bitcoin is that the payouts are so low it's not even worth playing - a few cents isn't anything and won't save you from starvation, homelessness, poverty, etc. I still have SaruTobi on my iPhone, however, there is no real incentive for me to play it even though you do give Bitcoin as a reward.
Perhaps one day I will start playing it again, though the game just gets boring after a while.

I quite liked the documentary, it did give some positive insight, was it a pitch to make Bitcoin mainstream and adoptable - maybe not! However, it did give insight to how it has gone from nothing to something in a matter of years, hopefully something will come from it and maybe another interesting documentary may come out at a later date, fingers crossed.

The whole bitcoin business is not trustworthy, has too many holes at the moment. I take trust in businesses that have performed or that have shown they can perform and deliver. If I was buying via an individual person, well wait it would not happen.
