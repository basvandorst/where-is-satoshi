Dude try independent reserve. Prices are pretty fair as well. You should never leave it on any exchange site though. Buy yourself a trezor or ledger and store it safely at home.

Just for the record, many Iranians had left their crypto on American exchanges due to difficulty obtaining trezors and ledgers inside the country. US has locked all accounts created from Iran until further notice. Most have lost access to their Bitcoins.
We need to find better ways to help people in these countries

The historical economic trend of BTC says this.
LN is still in its infancy. Many exciting projects are still in their development phase to solve scaling problems. Segwit has not been fully adopted yet. So much healthy news is coming in the 12 months, bolstering BTCs dominance and future. The price of BTC has always been linked to user uptake. We are still on track for $50,000 by the end of the year.

Well, since BTC is a brand new asset class based on an emerging technology, we would need an economist specialised in Blockchain technology and Bitcoin trends to provide an accurate forecast. Such an economist is still in the making and has many more years of observations before he or she can give solid advice. 
As a result, the best advice we can get is from those that have been following BTC for 5 years or more, learning from it and following its trends. These guys mostly believe the bubble is far from bursting.

Stop spreading FUD mate. Anyone that bought BTC 3 months ago is still up. Corrections are healthy. Get used to them and stay strong. Don't sell till 2020
