I’ve been doing some DCA all year and just hit my goal of stacking sats right now thanks to this dip!
@_date: 2019-08-06 19:33:41
Hey I'm new I'd love some of your 2012 bitcoin!
But really tons of new people pour in every day. The biggest influx may be happening over the past few months. Initially it was very few people, with the run up to 20k so many people jumped in but it happened so fast many missed out, and no one wanted to touch it when it hovered around 3-5k. I think access to it is easier now and people were ready to jump in during the run from 5-10k.

There is no way these ETFs would buy and hold the bitcoin associated with it. Most likely these etfs would be like buying bitcoin on robinhood...
@_date: 2019-08-21 17:04:52
Did you do the deposit on coinbase from their website or mobile app? I definitely see tons of people saying this method works and a ton that say it doesn't.
Edit: It worked. It may have been due to acct history or age of account. When I initially tried it my account was brand new.
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:51:47
I never said it would go up. Just it'll move in one direction. All a futures market is going to do is introduce more money but there will be people shorting bitcoin and betting big it'll go up. If you think you gain or lose a lot now in bitcoin, that amount of gain/loss will be a multitude higher in a futures market.
(Well maybe I'm still trying to understand how a bitcoin futures market will work)
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:45:45
I imagine a bitcoin ETF would act similar to robinhoods bitcoin. You're just trading or holding numbers on a screen. No real bitcoin will be purchased or sold on exchanges, but I imagine more exchanges will adopt something similar to robinhood.
@_date: 2019-08-19 16:28:32
Ah well mine does surpass the price of all the Trezor products. It's free to send coins to a cold storage but there's a fee to transfer the coins back to coinbase or another exchange, correct?
@_date: 2019-08-14 12:39:10
Yes but you have to use limit buys. Also, if you feel like buying that $1000 worth of bitcoin in $100 increments, 0.15%, you're still paying $1.5!
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:31:24

The company is a joke. They have nothing that another company or even smaller local competitors can't replicate. They have no exclusivity and no future long term as a large international company.
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:53:26
When does it make sense to move bitcoin to a cold storage wallet such as trezor if you're buying in small quantities regularly?
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:46:19
I always imagined the world at some point in the future will inevitable move to one world language and one world currency. It's the only thing that makes sense. Even if the one world currency is not bitcoin this currency (could be dollar, euro, BTC, etc) will become 100% a digital currency. Since bitcoin already has the strongest online network you could make a case that it would be the obvious choice. 
We are many decades away from anything close to this so it's impossible to guess at. More likely the human race just kills itself.
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:33:18
Honestly if you lived in my area I'd meet at a starbucks, buy some for you on an exchange and put it in your wallet. I'd do it for free if I knew you. So maybe find someone older into bitcoin I'm sure they'd be willing to do this for you. It wouldn't take more than half an hour.
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:37:25
This is the shit I was ready for getting into bitcoin. 4% in two minutes, pssh can't scare me away.
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:51:08
That's a great price point. I've been averaging on the last month or so and my average cost is around 10.7k and I'm pretty content with that. 
If anything I'd buy, it's showing good signs of consolidating around 9.5-11.5k for some time now. I think this fall will be huge for bitcoin. A ton of new money is getting in the game, it's positioning well for a large price increase.
@_date: 2019-08-07 12:58:32
Definitely an interesting bit of information you collected. Regardless if it stays flat or goes up/down I'm still buying and accumulating! I have a decent amount set aside and may try to buy at a larger amount for every 1,500 if drops if it does go down.
@_date: 2019-08-22 17:54:25
This was the biggest one for me. When I was in college and bitcoin was at $2000 I knew that was too much for me and decided to wait until after school. :( My average bitcoin purchase is right at 10k now

They say the first trillionaire has most likely already been born. Maybe the worlds first trillionaire will make that wealth through bitcoin. But now the highest anyone realistically predicts bitcoins market cap is close to that of gold. For bitcoin and gold to have a similar market cap bitcoin would have to pass $500,000.
Also you have to remember inflation, within a decade or two a millionaire will no longer be the impressive status it once was.
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:45:52
I use coinbase pro to buy bitcoin, the 0.15% fee is worth the wait time for funds to settle and I love the interface. With this current dip I wanted to buy instantly so I considered coinbase.
They charge a $1.5 per transaction! If I do my regular buy of $25 that's a 6% fee?!? I'll wait
Edit: It worked with in-between deposit as described below. It may have been due to acct history or age of account. When I initially tried it my account was brand new.
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:40:36
This almost has to make bitcoins price even MORE volatile! Either this time next in two weeks bitcoin will not be lazily floating around 10k

Honestly I think people should focus on the yearly low that bitcoin is hitting rather than the artificial spikes it's seeing. I doubt bitcoin will ever see 4-5k again but wouldn't be surprised if we see sub 10k again before the end of the year.

like u/theghostofdeno says this doesn't work. It may have at one point, but currently it says you have funds available on coinbase but it won't let you transfer until they fully clear around 5 days later. I tried it with USD and USDcoin. Are you currently using this method?

I hope the price will go up also. But what are you referring to you? I'm talking in general, I'm just venting in the daily thread not attacking one person.

@_date: 2019-10-03 18:09:30
I mean lets say you buy $100. The old fees it'd cost you $0.15 and now it'll cost you $0.50. While this is a substantial increase it's still fairly cheap for such a good trading platform. 
It's kinda hilarious as all major brokerages around the US slashed trading fees to $0 coinbase increases their fees by 3 times!

 When I do this in my coinbase pro it shows the following when transfer USD from coinbase to coinbase pro
Total balance $10.00

@_date: 2019-08-13 12:56:36
That would be quite the game changer. Wouldn't that drive the price up an insane amount even with just a couple midsized ETFs? 
Also, I'm not 100% sure how robinhood bitcoin works either, but I think it's all internal trading of numbers based on the price of bitcoin. I know for sure you or robinhood do not purchase any bitcoin when buying on robinhood
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:42:23
The miners mining will instead function as node and huge points of transactions will flow through them. They will then be able to earn money off of transaction fees. That's the end game for mining setups.
@_date: 2019-08-07 12:44:12
Automatic deposits. Automatic buys is possible in coinbase but comes with a huge fee. I want to do the coinbase pro to keep that fee lower.

I'd second this for coinbase pro. The need for the money to clear sucks but it's worth it. 0.15% fee allows you to buy bitcoin even with $20 and the fee is still negligible.
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:34:51
Yes my buddy uses Cash app (for non-bitcoin buying purposes). Do you know if there is an easier way to transfer my existing bitcoin to Cash app? I don't know why I'm so hesitant to move over to cash app. 
Probably because their website [cash.app]( and [cash.app/bitcoin]( comes off so cartoon-ish  and I don't want another app. I'll look into it more though

Previously, I was buying 5-10 worth of bitcoin at a time on robinhood (I knew the reasons not to do this just didn't want to open a wallett bc I was lazy) along with the rest of my individual stock portfolio. Today I finalized my coinbase pro wallet. I'm so excited to actually begin owning Bitcoin.
Any tips? I'll be buying in small $10 amounts weekly. I'll use the pro and set limit buys so I only pay a 0.15% fee on each purchase. Is this correct?
@_date: 2019-08-27 13:58:14

Definitely being able to buy right away and lock in that price point you want. I let my coins accumulate a little before moving them off CB, it doesn't really do much harm to let a few weeks of purchases sit in CB.
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:34:14
Coinbase has automatic regular deposits but I can't see to do that in coinbase pro. Is it easiest to set up automatic deposits in coinbase and transfer funds to coinbase pro immediately or just deposit weekly into coinbase pro?
I want to deposit a small amount, have it available the same day every week and buy a set amount weekly in coinbase pro to keep my expenses low (0.15% w limit buys).
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:01:20
I only have a smallish (\~1-1.5%) of my NW in bitcoin. For those of you that have bitcoin making up a larger percentage of your NW how do you handle the large swings? Only reason I stomach them easily is because my BTC is money I'm willing to lose.
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:35:38
Just made an extra DCA purchase because the bitcoin is still on sale and just cause, happy Friday everyone!
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:36:51
I'm aiming for the same! What's your average coin price right now? Mines around 8.6k which could be better but I'm happy with my decision to DCA.
@_date: 2019-08-12 17:27:18
Ah so you need a LN wallet to withdraw all those random lntips of a few satoshi? I figured there was some way to do that. I always just pay it forward.
@_date: 2019-10-04 12:55:04
I'm able to do this method and it clears immediately in coinbase, I transfer to coinbase pro. Then I buy my BTC and transfer out of CBP. I could do the whole process in less than a minute. It may be a issue due to the age of your account, the size of deposits, or you may need more money held in CB than you're trying to deposit as collateral. 
It 100% works. I only do $10-50 smaller amounts at a time to DCA.
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:29:53
What should "the little guys" that are stacking sats do? 
I'm currently with coinbase pro and have been since the limit trade fee was 0% back in early/mid 2018? Then I watched my minimal fee go up to 0.15% and now 0.5%. I mean even if I buy another few hundred on the following months it'll only be a $1 fee per $200 of BTC I buy. May not be worth the hassle of switching exchanges.
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:03:58

Buffett and Grahams strategy relates more to the stock market. So lets take a look and make some assumptions. 
Lets say the year is 2014, the market has been going crazy since crashing in 2008, and 2013 saw insane returns of 30% and you're convinced another downturn is around the corner so you start building up your cash position to buy low on the next big dip. So instead of investing 1k a month you only invest $500 and hold $500 a month in cash.
You're now holding 36k in cash in 2019 waiting for the next recession, maybe you're right and it'll happen early 2020. But so what because you already lost out on roughly $10,000 in return due to this cash drag over 5-6 years

Coinbase pro would be $0.25 for a $50 purchase, but yeah CBP still seems alright. 
And with Gemini and cashapp I assume you're talking about the price difference between what you're trying to purchase at and the real price you get? B/c cashapp charges no fee and gemini charges 0.25%? But they both have their downsides

Don't know about gemini's exchange but coinbase is garbage is scheduled buys. You can do scheduled buys but you'll be charged an arm and a leg!

Pretty much deposit cash into CB&gt;transfer into CB pro&gt; buy BTC&gt; transfer out

I'm halfway to my goal in terms of accumulated bitcoin. Currently have a average coin price of 8.7k! What's your average BTC price right now?
stacking sats!

Right?! This is just some random dude who has time in the middle of the work day, probably threw together this gif in 15 minutes just for useless internet points.

You sure you're an investor? Regardless, give it a go and get your feet wet. You can start with as little as 0.001 (\~$10) BTC on exchanges like coinbase, cashapp, etc. with fees as small as a few pennies.

I just BTFD. 9.4k
Don't worry it'll dip more now.

I've been putting off buying my hard wallet for months. I think I'll dive in now!

Question on taxes, US here. I know if you sell BTC into fiat you'll have to (legally) pay tax on the capital gains.
If you are only converting BTC into a different coin like a stable coin, USD coin/Dai, would you be able to avoid(legally) paying taxes on that?
Essentially do some swing trading but just converting from BTC to stable coin and back to BTC.
Edit: Apprently there is already a thread on this. It would work in France but not the US currently?

I don't know much about market trading but I'm 100% sure any stock or commodity will go up or down and to the right

I think we are just at the end of a bullish descending triangle. We're coming right to the end with a really tight range. I think bitcoin will hit the resistant right at 9.6k, before breaking out again.
This will all happen before the end of September. Definitely will shape up to be a crazy end of 2019 regardless of which direction it goes.

I'd suggest removing said balls from said altcoins. If you want to remain balls deep in something I'd go for the "balls deep in a squealing ₿itcoin while firing your rifle in the air"

Bitcoin price has hit 9,550 4 times in the past months and has been making lower ~~lows~~ **highs** every single spike. Getting ready for some real volatility in the next 3-4 weeks!

That's my plan. I'll never invest more than 1% of my investments in crypto. If this blows up then I retire earlier, if it goes to zero I may have tacked on an extra year until retirement

There was a post on this sub a long while back about someone who scammed the scammer. Somehow through innocence and confusion convinced the scammer to send him something like $50 in BTC to establish trust and then told her to pound sand.

Hey all just my average Monday DCA, bought at 8050 and it immediately jumps. Looking like the start to an awesome week and a huge October???

But this also gives you the ability to short bitcoin! Also, you can leverage your position in this. Plus they somehow sold it to investors that this is "safer" lol

I mean you're 100% right. I don't have have the time to day trade while trying to scalp ~0.3% per trade on a regular basis (fees on exchange I use, coinbase pro, are only 0.15%) What I'd probably attempt to do is a week long swing trade if I recognize an excellent opportunity and aim for a percent or two in a swing trade.
But ultimately it was just an idea and I won't be doing it.
