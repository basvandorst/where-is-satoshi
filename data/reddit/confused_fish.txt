I have read through a lot of the stuff on the sidebar. Most of the content is, understandably, related to buying, selling, wallets, along with the FAQ which I understand its qualitative explanations. 
The Bitcoin Wiki has a huge amount of information too I realise, but something like [this]( whilst obviously containts lots of technical info, I personally find quite inaccessible (to me, given my lack of technical understanding).
What I'm looking for is something perhaps a bit more accessible but not dumbed down. Something like a textbook level "An Elementary Introduction to Bitcoin", if such a thing exists.
Edited: Grammar.

In that case I may just change bank account, open a new one with my student address instead.
I do see how such a service would be very useful in your position though, I'll be sure to keep it in mind when I (hopefully) have something more substantial to protect :)
Again, many thanks for the reply.

Nope. It was very good though. A nice step up in detail from the beginner videos.

Wow thanks! First ever tip!

Will watch now. Many thanks.

Thanks for the information. I'll look into what you've mentioned. I'll definitely think twice before ever sending out so much information again.
Just out of interest would you're recommend signing up for a credit checking service as a student? I don't actually have very much in my bank account, so I'd be weighing the pro's and con's of paying £15 a month for something like that (that is, if my account were compromised, there isn't much they could run off with!). It may be easier for me to just close my old bank account and switch to a new one?
Thanks again.

Will do thanks.

Sorry I didn't mean to be unclear about my level of expertise. I'm quite up for a challenge, I have 4 months of summer to learn :). Thanks for the links.

Just out of interest, where do you live?
I realise a copy of a passport itself isn't all that useful, but surely a copy of bank details is just as good as the actual physical thing? And the two combined is a fairly worrying.

I enjoyed this thanks.
@_date: 2014-05-31 13:47:34
That looks spot on. Thanks!

I do understand the "it's your own fault" view, with regards to those who just left their coins on Mt. Gox, but I don't think it's a fair stance with regards to the personal data. 
You make a valid point with regards to reporting it as stolen. It seems silly that all the effort to make Bitcoin exchanges "know your customer" has backfired in such a spectacular way.
