Thanks for taking a look, but if you look closer, I think you will see that it is clearly not any sort of ponzi scheme, as everything is run clearly and transparently, with no room for fraud. Plus, it offers a tangible benefit. If you are not interested in using it, then don't, but please don't accuse it of being something fraudulent without evidence

Interesting analysis, but I wouldn't compare payments volume to market cap. What might be interesting instead is is to compare to the transaction volume of bitcoin. From this [chart]( it looks to be about 300000 btc per day, which is about USD $22 billion per year at current exchange rates. So if you consider bitcoin as a payment transaction network, we're currently about 15% of the size of paypal.

[Pixelco.in]( is collaborative distributed artwork in a bitcoin marketplace. 
What does that mean? Basically, you can buy any number of pixels you want and mark them with an image you upload. That's interesting by itself (eg, Million Dollar Homepage), and we could have stopped there.
But here's where it gets interesting, and uniquely "Bitcoin": pixel space you buy isn't necessarily yours forever. Somebody else can buy it from you, but if they do, you earn a profit! So the idea is that it isn't over when it fills up, but rather will keep being an interesting draw. And the process of signing up and buying pixels is fast, fun, and easy, thanks to our design and the magic of bitcoins!
