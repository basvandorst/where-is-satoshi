Working on trustless implementation of MiniTip right now. I see that is the only implementation of a tipbot that will be of any real value/use. Thank you for the ideas.

thanks for posting! 500 bits

is it possible that transactions never get confirmed? i remember reading about Bitcoin days and that the likelihood of transactions being confirmed increases as time wears on.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:58:46
indeed 1000 bits
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:33:42
Good PSA 500 bits :)
Is there a reason wallets don't have flat fee options (other than the delay in transaction confirmation that a wallet with too much dust could produce)? I feel like that's the most logical if users don't mind delays, no?
e.g. a 100 bit fee for every transaction? My service uses a flat 100 bit fee so that things are more deterministic, wondering whether that's the best option or not.
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:03:50
1000 bits this would remove MiniTip's custodial aspect completely, thanks for sharing! Programmability was all that was missing from Bitcoin for it to become the perfect currency imo. Well that and low fees.
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:59:02
Great ideas, I'll save this post for when I begin working on an off-chain method. It does seem like the better way. That is, unless Core develops an insanely good micropayment system lol.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:17:54
As long as your tip is &gt; ~$0.50, it sort of makes sense with a $0.10 flat miner's fee
But yeah, for smaller tips it's not great. Thinking of extending to off-chain when I have time in the summer. Makes a lot more sense for smaller amounts. On-chain was the best solution I had for a quick project at the time I began.
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:18:12
thank you very much, this helps a lot. working on a solution right now.

@_date: 2017-03-29 19:48:57
I wonder if 0 fee, 0 confirmation tips would work well... Any thoughts?
The 0 conf transaction would be sent to the recipient from the tipbot's custodial address, whose balance is only updated after a deposit has been confirmed. So there is no risk of double spending, but I guess there would be a risk of the tip never being confirmed...
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:11:28
Wow thank you, that is actually very helpful... So maybe a 100 bit flat fee isn't a good idea after all. Just wish the network was better suited for micro transactions. The only really solid options seem to be off-chain, relatively centralized solutions.
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:33:54
Yeah that was the initial plan, but doing that adds complexity as well as removes the reliability that comes with everything being stored on-chain. Then again, for small transactions the highest reliability is not strictly necessary (especially if it comes at the cost of high fees).
We'll see how this model goes and if the fee deters people too much, I can always change it.
Thanks for your input! 500 bits
And nope not a stock exchange
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:02:51
Do you have any suggestions for transparency? I know my own intentions, but you're right and making it as trustless as possible is the best way, just like with Bitcoin itself.
I've been trying to think of ways to make it 100% peer-to-peer so that no funds are stored on our end at all. Might implement something like multisig in future, as long as it's still convenient.
Once again, for anyone reading, **please do not use the service to deposit if you are not comfortable, it is a brand new, unproven service.** You can simply be a receiver of tips and not deposit anything yourself. That's a perfectly fine way to use the service.
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:36:54
Yeah, been trying to think of a way to make it non custodial without going external at all, but it just doesn't seem possible (at least without a lot of added complexity). I tried working on a few things inspired by posts here but nothing really seemed viable. Browser client side add-on seems like the way to go. I'll begin work on it when I have time.
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:00:13

It's called a quote, denoted by the weird " symbols before and after the string of combinations of characters separated by spaces.

which is why blocksize increase comes after lightning
@_date: 2017-04-22 01:51:14
yeah but this is bitcoin, not monero. so this adds more use-cases for bitcoin theoretically that previously could only be done via monero (and this way relies only on old-fashioned hand-to-hand value transfer rather than complex cryptography).

@_date: 2017-04-21 22:06:27


Not necessarily, since computers are very quick. Especially since the computer will be connected to the internet, after the malware has entered your system there's not much you can do to protect your information in the few seconds it takes for it to e.g. send your data over to the attacker.
But what they are working on with the standalone hardware device looks great.
@_date: 2017-04-17 13:19:32
paypal charges 3%, what are you talking about? also when you withdraw it costs you as well.

I think the main issue with it is that it requires being plugged into a computer, because that opens an avenue for anyone to make a visually similar device and load it with malware (most people will not examine further than a glance). Either way, I'm not plugging any foreign usb devices into my PC even if it comes from a friend.
If you guys could make it somehow independent of a PC (a tall order I'm sure) it would be a hell of a lot more useful.
@_date: 2017-04-17 02:36:47


that's exactly what lightning is for, which is being blocked for political reasons. bitcoin is not being allowed to grow into a global currency because of a few egos.
@_date: 2017-04-05 09:31:00
fixed, your tip was sent. pretty sure it had to do with really high transaction volume on the chain yesterday keeping transactions unconfirmed. i wish we could just get a scaling solution passed already. i don't want to have to create a centralized database for balances.
anyway, apologize for the trouble, 1000 bits

No, it saves on hardware costs too:


@_date: 2017-04-17 02:28:18
no, if you only want to receive tips you don't need to send any btc to the address.
all you need to do is message with your tip receival address in the message body and all future tips you receive will be sent directly there.

in a circular economy you wouldn't need to convert to fiat &amp; back. that's what I meant by "whenever the world is ready for it."
the fee was 10 cents and it got cleared in &lt; 2 hours.

kind of, it's on-chain so not great right now. waiting for lightning for it to be awesome :D
@_date: 2017-04-17 13:27:55
Didn't know that :), then the utility is relatively decreased (assuming one does not care about financial privacy or freedom, which unfortunately most don't).
Still more convenient than getting someone's email in private and them knowing your full name and address if you just want to send them some money. But not by that much.
@_date: 2017-04-17 03:02:16
if you want to send tips, message the bot (with 'deposit' in the body and it will give you instructions :)
