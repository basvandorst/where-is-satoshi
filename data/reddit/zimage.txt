Thank you for your reply. I too implemented BIP38 (in python-bitcoinlib), but you gave a much more through analysis than I was planning to.

This project looks great. I tried to connect to your github, but it seems to be gone. When are you planning to have the code and schematics online?

I'm using someone else's library for the key generation. The only crypto-ish code I've added is the base58 encoding to convert private and public keys to WIFs and addresses. I can look into it, though.

I am currently furloughed (kind of; long story), so I cash out my measly .3 BTC of mining income each week using coinbase.

The point of these wallets is for archiving. Your safety deposit box doesn't care that you have a picture of Snoop Lion on your wallet. For that reason, I want the QR codes to be as robust as possible. I have the highest setting for error correction turned on in my example.

I paid for my Jalapenos in April; 10 of them for just shy of $3000. If I would have simply spent that money on Bitcoin and held on to them, I'd have $30,000 now. As it is, I got my miners three weeks ago and am about $2000 in the hole. Mining pays, but not well.

My rig is 72 GH/s which is earning me about 38 mBTC/day at the moment.

I created a template in  so you can use these images right now and offline.

Use my python Bitcoin paper wallet library!

For python users out there, I'll plug my fork of python-bitcoin lib which has initial BIP 0038 support.
The only thing still missing is EC_Multiply encryption. EC-Multiply decrypt and intermediate generation do work.

Bandung takes Bitcoin?! I'll have to stop there when I visit home for the holidays.

python main.py *template-filename* *image-filename*
For example, if you downloaded paperwallets_pack.zip from bitcoinonpaper.net, then put the images in the same directory as main.py and type


You should find a file called bar.png in your CWD with the QR codes filled in.

OpenTSDB might be a better option instead of a traditional RDMS.

One of the first standalone hardware paper wallet printers uses an archival quality thermal printer. He says the ink is good for 30 years or something like that.

My UW advice. Join the [UPL]( I was a coordinator for a few years. You'll get to know the best minds in the CS program there.

It uses openssl for the key generation. I'm using someone else's python library for this part. I've performed several verifications with TP's Go Bitcoin Tests and all was well. My main contribution is the programmatic image composition. The code is open. If you find any problems with the correctness, I'd love for you to tell me.

Looks like someone solved it. Blockchain shows that all the funds were transferred out. Anyone know what the key is?

Because people buy them. They *are* profitable to the manufacturer.
I like the saying that, in the American gold-rush, the people who got rich weren't the ones heading west to pan for gold. The people who got rich were the ones selling the shovels.
