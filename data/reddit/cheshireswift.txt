I wouldn't go that far... That would suggest that extremists here have the ability to actually do anything.

Except that Big Bang Theory apparently doesn't use canned laughter. 
Not to mention it's not that bad. That 70's Show is worth getting over your pretensions for.

I think it was a joke.

Eh, that I can agree with.

Good point, well made.
