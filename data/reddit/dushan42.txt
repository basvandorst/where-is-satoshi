I guess that's an engineer 'trivial', not a real world trivial :)

The miners get the fees. The unfortunately named 'mining' is actually just a computationally expensive method of confirming a block of transactions. Each transaction specifies a list of inputs and outputs (both with an amount and a Bitcoin address). If the amount of input BTC exceeds the output, it is awarded to the miner that wins the race to confirm that block. Basically you're saying something like: I'm sending 3.01BTC from account X, it will credit account Y with 3BTC. This transaction has an excess of 0.01BTC that goes to the miner.
As for the block size limit - it is trivial to change the protocol to allow for bigger block sizes if this becomes an issue. If the majority of the network agrees to the change by upgrading to that protocol, it becomes the new limit.

Sour grapes perhaps?
I don't know if Bitcoin is viable but the author's arguments against it are pretty weak. The blocks are expensive to create by design - that's what secures the transactions. The coin generation is a side effect - a clever way to gradually seed the money into the system in a completely decentralized way as well as motivate people to throw their processing power into the pool.
Interestingly it looks like one of his counter example (DigiCash) is defunct exactly because it wasn't decentralized. With Bitcoin there isn't a central agency to take out. 
I also don't buy the argument against proof-of-work - the paper linked is about stopping spam. That's a completely different application of the concept - the legitimate mail and spam's POW requirements are in conflict. Bitcoin is designed so that the block generation ticks at a steady rate no matter how much processing power is involved. More is better really - it makes it that much less likely a Russian botnet wreaks havoc.
I'll read some of the other references provided later, but to me it seems like the author hasn't quite grokked what's going on here. Yes, the CPU usage seems extremely wasteful and it bugs me to. However that in no way affects the soundness of Bitcoin as an online currency.
We'll see where this crazy thing takes us...

Here are a few phone pics from the finale: 
It was a fantastic crowd with a slightly above average concentration of redditors. The tour of the Internet Archive was an unexpected bonus (I even bought some BTC there!).
Kashmir - thank you for your excellent series of articles and for organizing the Bitcoin themed flash mob - it was a blast!

Yep... it's a shame the designers seem anti-Bitcoin given that the game's setting sounds an awful lot like the Bitcoin scene a few years from now :)

Note that brainwallet and paper wallet are not mutually exclusive.

It's actually 'Android: Netrunner' and yeah, it's a reboot of the old game. It's pretty good but now I'm irked about them mocking Bitcoin :). At least they acknowledged it!

Wow, is this a widespread belief!?
Let's for the sake of demonstration assume you're picking words for your passphrase from a dictionary with 65,536 words. Each word is equivalent to 16 bits of a private key so to match the security of a 256 bit key you need 16 words picked at random. Two words in this scenario are equivalent to only a 32 bit key (only 4.2 billion combinations, which is fairly trivial to brute force).
Brainwallet passphrase is not like your typical password as the information needed to brute force it is public. In fact it can be pre-calculated (see rainbow tables) which is why weak brainwallets get cleaned out so quickly.
'Salting' your phrase with personal information helps but you absolutely need something in the range of 16 words to be safe.
Please spread the word!
