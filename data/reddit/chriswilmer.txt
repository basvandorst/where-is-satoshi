This depends a lot on how many people you imagine using Bitcoin. With the current transaction limits, you couldn't even get all of the institutions of the world (let alone people) using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:25:02
Everything was great about this except Balaji's explanation of why the price was down. The hash rate explanation makes no sense (and Bitcoin's prior price history is a simple counter example to this thesis). I think price movements are just one of those topics that don't lend themselves to simple, concise explanations.

I am a huge Trezor fan, but in general I would say the greatest peace of mind comes from using a hardware wallet (Ledger, Case, etc.).

It will definitely happen, but when it does it won't be a big deal.
@_date: 2015-06-08 14:27:43
Ah, well, perfect. I don't see the point of creating additional paper wallets or using BIP38 then. Just put your mnemonic seed in a vault, or whatever, and then enable passphrase protection on the Trezor. Even if someone steals your seed, they won't know the passphrase (very similar to encrypting paper wallets but much more usable).

Could it be possible that you *might* be wrong about BIP101 being bad for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:11:40
Well, depends how you feel about giving up 25% of your BTC to keep the other 75% safe (since a Trezor costs 0.5 BTC).
I assume we're in agreement that it's a bad idea to buy a Trezor if you only have 0.5 BTC right?

Except it's not (just) Gavin's proposal. It's a proposal that has been discussed, tweaked, and reflects the thoughts and wishes of many, many people. Just because *some* people disagree with the proposal in the end doesn't mean it's not the result of a large number of other people coming to a consensus about it.

So why don't Adam Beck et al. actually propose a concrete plan &amp; timeline for dealing with increased transaction volume then? Doing nothing is also risky.
I apologize in advance if they have, but I certainly haven't seen it published anywhere.

What about the problem Jeff Garzik mentioned, namely that Bitcoin cannot go beyond 32 MB blocks in its current form because of "other issues." (presumably something to do with data types).
@_date: 2015-06-03 15:15:27
Not that this helps you, but your story is an excellent case study for getting a Trezor. Given that a Trezor costs about 0.5 BTC and you had 120, it would have made it easy for you to keep them safe. I am really saying this for the sake of others at this point... consider getting a Trezor if you have over 10 BTC!
@_date: 2015-12-08 03:53:00
I don't know. Am I? How would I know?
@_date: 2015-06-06 19:14:37
Have you used a Trezor? We're not talking about how easy it is to use Bitcoin (which is not easy enough yet) but how to secure private keys. Trezors are idiot-proof in this respect. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:18:48
That has pretty much always been true, which is my point. It was cheaper to mine a bitcoin three years ago, but bitcoins were $5 then. It was always very close to break-even for most miners, if not for electricity costs then for capital costs.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:56:28
The gist of the idea is to assume that bitcoins are distributed among people roughly the same way wealth is distributed. Even if all 7 billion people on earth had bitcoins, 90% of them would belong to the top 1%. The poorest 3.5 billion (which would dominate the median) would have less than 5% of the 21 million bitcoins distributed among them.
I made up the the precise numbers in this example, but hopefully you get the idea.

This article makes no sense. What everyone is saying is that you can't separate a token from a blockchain... which is 100% the case. The author describes use cases where a token is indeed not needed, but neither is a blockchain. Nothing wrong with using a distributed database that requires trust... but that's not a blockchain.

I wouldn't worry about it at all. The dollars you get in change at the grocery store could have been recently transacted with in a violent drug deal. Even if the police could trace it, you wouldn't be at fault. The point is that you were actually mining for those bitcoins, and if it ever came to it, you could show people the hardware you used, when you received the coins, etc.
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:08:13
No, don't do that! There isn't a lot of evidence that this is true... rather, it seems like a self-perpetuating story that started by inaccurate media portrayals in the first place.
Does everybody on the Internet agree exactly about what Bitcoin is for? Of course not. Is there "tension between two camps"? I hardly think so.
@_date: 2014-11-25 14:36:02
Yeah it's probably less than 500 MW.
Edit: I would be very suspicious of the 6000 GH/s using 1600 watts claim. I think 1 GH/s ~ 1000 watts is the standard for a very efficient miner right now.

I am surprised how often this question comes up. Does no one do the basic arithmetic of dividing the total number of potential users by 21 million bitcoins?
Unless you think Bitcoin will only ever be used by a tiny minority of people (which is fine, many pessimists think so) there is no way the price of a bitcoin could stay below $10,000 USD per BTC.

If someone sends a spam 0.0001 btc transaction to one of those addresses, then it counts as updated.

My only qualm here is that it seems Counterparty (even in its name) is designed for use in trading assets on the blockchain. My use of the word "arguably" refers to the fact that I think that for purely trading assets, colored coins and counterparty are arguably equally sufficient for this purpose. Of course, if you have Turing-complete capabilities then you can do all sorts of crazy stuff... but I don't see why a blockchain-based stock exchange couldn't accomplish everything it needed to do with just colored coins.

Hmm... the plan seems unnecessarily complicated. If you can guarantee that once you sell it will cause a subsequent panic sell, then you don't need any other elements in your strategy to make money. You simply buy back after the panic sale and wait for the price to reequilibrate. This can be done at any time without relying on wars or other outside events.
The reason it doesn't always work is that you can't guarantee a follow up panic sale.

First of all, some people are millionaires (many, actually) and they have bank accounts and they deposit and withdraw $200,000+ all the time and the bank doesn't blink an eye. It's not THAT unusual.
If you have that money, congratulations. If it's unusual for you (from the bank's perspective) then you just have to be aware of the Bank Secrecy Act, where they will secretly flag your account shortly after your deposit. The important thing is to let your bank know ahead of time what you're doing, and then to leave that money in the account for a few weeks before withdrawing it (money launderers and terrorists try to move money between accounts very quickly). Of course, report capital gains taxes.
Way to go!

You seem confused. If you never sold any bitcoins, then you shouldn't have any earnings.
However, if you bought low, sold high, and then bought bitcoins at a lower price again, then you would owe the IRS taxes even though you don't have any USD to pay with. There's no magical solution to this... you just need to sell some of those bitcoins (in 2014) to pay for your earnings in 2013.
Also... maybe you should consult a tax professional.

I know a lot of people still don't know what colored coins are. It's just using bitcoins to track assets in a very simple and elegant way. They're not altcoins, and it's not a centralized service. Mastercoin/Counterparty are arguably more powerful, but they're also more complex. I'm a big fan of colored coins!
(you don't need to "buy" anything to use colored coins... you can convert a tiny amount of bitcoins into *any* amount of colored coins, and if you get bored of the idea, you can convert them back... no sidechains or extra tokens necessary)

It's an interesting thought process you have, but it runs counter to empirical evidence. There are already hundreds (if not thousands by now) of Bitcoin clones... and they aren't devaluing bitcoins at all (which is quite the opposite of what is typically assumed to be the consequence of inflation due to printing more of the same currency).
Sometimes I like to point out that the value of gold is completely unaffected by the existence of other metals or elements that people *could* use as a store of value.

I'm re-reading them... but they are not so easy to understand.
It seems like the data IS pruneable, but there are risks involved in doing so that you are pointing out. 
If reindexing is a somewhat rare event (let's say once a month), what is the cost-benefit of keeping the outputs (taking up precious RAM) vs. pruning them and then having some trouble when reindexing (presumably you need to redownload the whole blockchain... or just the pruned outputs, I don't know)? These details aren't in your posts.

Wouldn't it make sense, for strategic reasons, for investors who are willing to put so much money into a Bitcoin company... to also buy up some bitcoins? Your Bitcoin company risks getting dragged down if Bitcoin itself is crashing (even if the crash "only" lasts 6-12 months). I mean, maybe they have, but it hasn't felt like that kind of money has been injected into the Bitcoin market lately.

Instead correlating price and difficulty, why don't you investigate the relationship between price and "cost of producing a bitcoin"?
Too super simplify things, ignore capital costs, choose a fixed power cost (say $0.10 / KWh), and then have the energy efficiency vary from 10,000 J / GH in 2010 to 0.5 J / GH in the present day.
I bet you would see something interesting.

The network does not need to be aware of the public address prior to sending BTC to it.
As long as a Bitcoin address satisfies some simple checksum requirements, it is considered valid by most clients (and the network), and you can send bitcoins to it... independent of whether anybody knows the private key associated with that address.

It used to be so much worse... it's hard to imagine. These days the worst things people say about Bitcoin are along the lines of "it can never work."

This is a silly argument. It's like saying gold is inflationary because there are other metals. If you maintain that position then that's fine, but referring to some kind of money as inflationary starts to become meaningless.

All I am trying to say is that I think the article is wrong, because the downward pressures it's referring to have existed for much longer than the current downward price trend. Specifically, those pressures existed for many years while the price was going up. Thus the reasons brought up in this article aren't very compelling.

How is an asset that goes up in purchasing power (a lot) not a good store of value? I completely disagree with people who say that stable purchasing power makes something a good store of value... stable is OK, but increasing purchasing power is even better.

Does it really matter what it sounds like? From an individuals perspective, your needs to store value are fulfilled even if your asset has the "fault" of increasing in purchasing power over time.

I think the best thing to do is to pose to him a riddle: How would you get a group of people who don't trust each other and that can only communicate by sending messages on an unreliable network (i.e., messages can be intercepted) to come to a consensus on a particular decision (to be specific, you can say that they have to decide whether to go to a movie on Saturday or Sunday).
Let him try and try. If he gives up and says "it's not possible" then you can turn around and say that it is possible, and that's exactly what Bitcoin mining solves. Then maybe he would be interested in reading up on the details.

It's often helpful to think of your bitcoins as being "kept" or "stored" wherever your private key is stored. If you spend too long thinking carefully about this you realize that it's not well defined to speak of bitcoins as having a location (in your mind or otherwise).

I want to ask if the increasing-the-block-size-by-50%-every-year makes sense over a 50 (or 100) year timescale. I know we can't assume Bitcoin will exist for that long but surely we don't want to make design choices that assume it will be short-lived. 
my concern is that 1.5^100 is a big number, fyi
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:17:07
Are you serious? The situations in the past have been much worse. A forked blockchain? Even I thought that might be the end of Bitcoin. And the most famous crash had to do with the only real Bitcoin exchange at the time (Mt. Gox) being completely hacked.

That's not how it works. It doesn't matter whether the shares were denominated in BTC or not. If you buy shares with BTC, it's like buying a car with BTC... a barter trade for tax purposes -- and in doing so you realize the gains (or losses) on the BTC you used for the transaction.

It's a good idea, but you don't need to commit to buying anything/month to make it work. You can just pledge to buy bitcoin if it falls below X. Then, if enough people do it (and are to be believed), then X becomes the floor.
I think a billionaire like Richard Branson should pledge to buy any amount of bitcoins if they fall below $10. He could afford it, people trust him, and from that point on nobody could say "your bitcoins might go to zero!" Moreover, Sir Branson would probably never actually have to make good on his pledge.

I kind of skimmed your analysis, but consider that for a fixed price, technological innovation can lead to a dramatic rise in difficulty (because the hardware &amp; power cost per BTC gets reduced dramatically). I think the ASIC arms race tells the whole story over the past two years. If a new ASIC comes out in a few months that reduces power consumption by a factor of 4, then even if the price goes down to $150, you will see the hashrate double.
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:05:52

@_date: 2014-11-14 16:34:41
Yeah, but there are hidden orders, and that's also just one exchange. As the price went up on one exchange, people would transfer bitcoins from elsewhere because it would be an arbitrage opportunity.

The anti store of value argument is disingenuous crap. Anybody who has been storing value in bitcoin for more than a year has had a great experience. It's ridiculous to say that something is a bad store of value because the price goes up so fast.

Agree with everything you said.It seems there is a strong market demand for a cheaper hardware wallet though. I already bought six (!) Trezors, but I would have bought 20-30 probably if they were half the price. If the capital cost is $19 for you guys then maybe you would make even more in net profit if you lowered the sale price (because of increased sales volume).

It's undervalued relative to the price of Bitcoin when/if it is adopted as a mainstream digital currency. That's why it is a "good" investment (it's a very risky one though).
Today, several million people use Bitcoin... and Facebook has over a billion users. If Bitcoin was as widely adopted as Facebook, it's value would be hundreds (if not thousands) of times higher, because the same number of bitcoins would spread among a much larger amount of people.

By what logic would your txn be only on that one chain? Your txn would go in the mempool and, if it had a reasonable fee, miners on either chain would add it.

They know. They've always known this.
@_date: 2016-12-05 15:27:40
If the transaction that is relevant to you is present in all of the forks, why would it be unpredictable to you? In the 75/25 case the longest orphaned chain was 4 blocks... so waiting for 6 blocks (or 12), which for any high value transaction you should do anyway, would work just fine.

Do any of these support xpub keys for viewing balances in hierarchical deterministic wallets?
@_date: 2015-08-05 15:27:18
Transactions on the blockchain don't map neatly to user numbers (although admittedly it is a decent proxy). I'm sure you're aware of offchain transactions, which Coinbase reports (its own) on its website (and there is a considerable number of them).
Also, single blockchain transactions can have many inputs and outputs. 
In any case, do you think Coinbase is lying about its user account numbers?
@_date: 2015-08-05 16:19:54
Hmm... that's strange. It works fine for me. What happens when you try using Blockchain.info?
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:13:41
Also, yes, you're right. People should research first... helpful point!
@_date: 2015-08-26 01:52:19
Does it work with Trezor yet...?
@_date: 2015-08-05 15:10:17
Why? Also, I don't understand why people don't use Coinbase's user accounts as a starting point for this kind of estimation. They have over 2 million user accounts, and they count wallets separately (for users that have multiple wallets with them). 
I would bet on there being 3+ million Bitcoin users globally at least.
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:19:18

@_date: 2015-08-04 19:56:59
So, just so you know, Blockchain.info does this just fine (just paste in the xpubkey in the search box). Of course, after today, I wouldn't really trust them.
Goochain also does this fine... but I'm not sure if it is still being actively developed.

I don't think it's clear that this would be worse for the small guys. It would be better for some (big or small) and worse for others (big or small). In fact, people often bring up the biggest Chinese miners as those who would stand to lose the most with bigger blocks due to their poor connectivity. It would just shift the advantage (marginally) to those with access to faster Internet connections.
(Also, let's keep in mind that if bitcoins become more valuable due to a larger userbase, everyone in the ecosystem stands to benefit).

@_date: 2015-07-06 20:56:29
Yeah, I thought about that, but a miner would only recover X% of their transaction fees... where X% is their proportion of the overall hashrate. So, if you have 40% of the hashrate, you can spend $10,000 a day spamming the network and get back $4,000 of it. That's pretty much the best case scenario... you're still losing money.

@_date: 2015-08-04 16:28:45
Well, perhaps one order of magnitude at the extremes. Are block propagation times between different miners varying by orders of magnitude? How does that affect your central argument about "only the fittest" surviving? In either case, yes, of course, only the fittest miners will survive (best connected, cheapest electricity, best hardware, best security, lowest possibility of being affected by natural disasters... etc.)

Yes and yes. The transaction fees are added to the 25 btc reward and given to whoever solves that block. Regarding the second point about the number of transactions per block, the limit on block size was chosen (I believe) to be able to handle thousands (not millions or more) of transactions to help keep things small early on. It would be an uncontroversial update to the protocol when bitcoin gets bigger to allow for larger block sizes.
@_date: 2012-12-10 23:45:28
This analysis is completely off. There is no reason why the electricity costs should scale with bitcoin value growth. In the unlikely scenario that Bill Gates wanted to buy a lot of bitcoins tomorrow (say $1 billion USD worth) each bitcoin might be worth 10x as much, but the electricity costs would be unaffected (in the short term). In general I think it's hard to relate the two.

@_date: 2015-04-30 16:33:08
It's a big mistake. The odds of losing all of your money from investing in a Bitcoin company are far greater than investing in Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin companies have to grow and make money in a short time (3-5 years) before pulling the plug, while Bitcoin the protocol has *significantly* more patience (i.e., it can survive many years of low interest and adoption before finally succeeding). 
*Note*: I am not making the case that either is guaranteed to succeed.

Unfortunately, this would *dramatically* increase our costs. I hope you noticed that our journal is open-access (i.e., free to read) AND doesn't charge author fees (i.e., free to publish).

It took me a while to figure out that the SECOND public key was used to scan the blockchain and the FIRST public key was used for entropy. My quick-fix suggestion would be just to explicitly say for the first key: "Please export a public key to generate entropy (not used for tracking your bitcoins)."

Because it's only called multiplication... the actual operation has little to do with what we commonly refer to as multiplication. 
A rough analogy would be matrix multiplication. You cant "just" divide a matrix... it's a very computationally expensive process and prohibitively so for elliptic point multiplication.

Right. It was just a pedagogical example. I am not saying Bitcoin has a 1% chance of success at all.
The point is that whether or not you think a bitcoin is too expensive or not depends on two things:
1) The equilibrium value of a bitcoin is once it achieves mainstream adoption
2) Your personal, subjective feeling about the odds of the above happening
So if you think "sure, bitcoins would be a million bucks each if they were the global currency everybody used, but that's NEVER going to happen!" then you wouldn't buy bitcoins at any price.

Safest way is to create an offline transaction. It's a little complicated but here are the steps:
1) Download the tx history of your bitcoin address, you can do that here: 
2) Download Brainwallet.org so that you can run it on an offline computer.
3) Run Brainwallet.org on the offline computer. Type in your passphrase (you are safe if you are offline) to get the private key.
4) Using a USB key, copy the tx history you downloaded to the offline computer.
5) Use the transactions tab in brainwallet.org, click edit inputs, and paste the tx history.
6) Make sure the destination address for the transaction is the address of the new, safer wallet address (however you generated it).
7) Set the transaction fee, click "re-sign".
8) Copy the raw transaction and paste it here (and click send):
9) You're done. Your bitcoins have moved to a new address without ever exposing your private key to the Internet.
MAKE SURE TO TRIPLE CHECK THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT DESTINATION ADDRESS AND THAT YOU ARE SENDING THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF BITCOINS.
MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT SENDING ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS AS THE FEE. JUST INSPECT EVERY FIELD CAREFULLY AND YOU'LL BE FINE&gt;

Anyway, I think your skepticism (which is healthy) is the reason why bitcoins are "so cheap." Most people are placing very low odds on Bitcoin's success as a global, mainstream phenomenon. I think it's fairly uncontroversial to say that if Bitcoin really did become as mainstream as Facebook (i.e., a billion+ users), then each bitcoin would be worth $100,000+ USD. The fact that bitcoins are "only" $300-400 right now reflects fairly widespread skepticism about Bitcoin's future.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:41:52

However, "only transaction fees" could be a very substantial amount of bitcoins. If the whole world was using bitcoins, you could expect something like 10 billion transactions per day. If the fee for each transaction was a penny (whatever that came out to in bitcoins at the time), that would be $100 million USD in transaction fees per day!

Colored coins aren't magic that make all problems disappear. There's always going to be counter party risk when buying tokens that represent assets. Colored coins just removes one link in the chain of trust (i.e., stock exchanges). 
To answer your question directly, any individual can color coins and issue them to others. At that point it becomes a centralized, counter-party risk situation, but one that is much better than what we currently have with Bitfunder, BTCT, GLBSE, etc.

I think the price will go up. As a thought experiment, imagine that I am an irrational miner who decides to plug in my 5000 GH/s miner and just keep my bitcoins (this can approximate a collection of miners who recently receive new mining rigs). All of the other miners now receive fewer bitcoins for the same amount of electricity, and so they won't want to sell them as cheaply. 
Also, the more people mining, the more secure the bitcoin network. That also increases the value of bitcoins.

Bitcoin miners create new blocks from scratch and then add them to the existing chain of blocks (i.e., the blockchain). So, the short answer is that blocks come from miners.
Also, blocks will never run out... new blocks will get added to the blockchain forever. The 21 million bitcoin limit comes from the fact that the number of new bitcoins mined in each block gets less and less with time.

Go to "advanced" in blockhain and then there is an option to export the private key. The private key is everything, if you have the private key you can access your bitcoins from anywhere.

I don't understand why he would bother stating that bitcoins aren't money because they aren't widely adopted. It's like seeing Facebook in its infancy and saying it isn't a social media platform because it has no users. Bitcoin is clearly designed to be money just like Facebook is designed to be a social media platform and any statements about whether the design will be successful need to apply a modicum of imagination about future adoption.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:09:25
It would probably be over $1 million USD in today's dollars (although in the scenario you describe, dollars might no longer be used as much and may not be a good point of comparison).
It sounds crazy, but that is what you would expect if over a billion people used bitcoin regularly (a lot of infrastructure would need to be built to get there though and this is probably decades away).
@_date: 2013-10-07 02:40:22
I think your understanding of ECDSA is just fine, except that the brute-forcing part would take forever. The "hard" part of any elliptic curve cryptography-based scheme is figuring out the number k, given only Q and G in the following:
Q = k*G
Of course, you can start at k = 1 and go until k = 2^256 and eventually you will find the right k, but apparently even with an extremely efficient computer it would require more energy than what is contained in the entire Sun to do so (with reasonably probability, that is... you could guess on the first try in principle).

Although I agree that with an offline computer, you may as well use encrypted digital backups, if a user only has one always online computer, creating a paper wallet doesn't seem like terrible advice. To be more specific, if you are on a "live" computer you can generate a bitcoin address and copy it down on a piece of paper by hand without exposing yourself to a keylogger. Not sure what protection you would use on an online computer to prevent keylogging.

Think about the context. A lot of other exchanges have LOST their customer's BTC funds due to hackers. I would much rather have these kinds of problems (slow withdrawals) than higher risk of theft.
Frankly? I think it should be even slower. I think bitcoin currency exchanges should have a 1-week lag whenever you want to withdraw bitcoins. Once you withdraw to some other online wallet, everything can be lightening quick, but having the exchanges be super paranoid about security is fine with me.

The opposite of what you say is true. It makes no difference (as in identically zero) whether you spend bitcoin or fiat to purchase anything. The money you "lost" if bitcoin goes up in value is the same (because you could have used your fiat to buy bitcoins instead).

I would just keep in mind that bitinstant, like all bitcoin companies, is a small startup with a handful of employees, that suddenly has 100x more users than they expected to have. There are growing pains. If we all took fumbling startups to court... there would be no startups and the value of bitcoin would tank.

Here is a poorly articulated argument for you: it's one thing to argue about the benefits of 10 minute confirmation times vs. 2.5 minute confirmation times, it's another thing to experiment and see how things play out. It's hard to do this experiment when you have an "established" currency like Bitcoin and next-to-zero adoption currencies... but when you have two cryptocurrencies that both have a sufficiently large userbase, you can get a better feel for the differences.
Honestly, it's just a hunch at this point that litecoins (and other alt cryptocurrencies) will be UNEXPECTEDLY useful. Once we know precisely why they are useful, their value will probably already reflect it.
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:23:54
I think that's overstating the case. Several sites accept Litecoin for services right now, and the value of litecoins has gone up tremendously over the past week. This whole bitcoin-fork thing really does present a tangible reason for having multiple crypto-currencies.

I think focusing on Mt.Gox is missing the big picture. Mt.Gox has very serious issues right now. Back then (at $5 per BTC), you could only use Mt.Gox and a small number of other exchanges, now there are 10x as many exchanges. That alone allows one to withdraw much more significant USD per day than previously possible. Furthermore, I am sure that CoinX, Coinsetter, and other US exchanges catering to Wall Street will allow millions of dollars to move freely back and forth by the time BTC is $10,000 per coin.
If there is one thing I am very certain of, it is that if it does NOT become easy to withdraw millions of dollars per day from exchanges, then bitcoin will not go to $10,000 USD per coin.

My objection to "millies" is that it isn't specific to bitcoins. If litecoins take off... or any concept whatsoever (some future liquid drug?) that is divisible to 3 decimal places, people might want to refer to them by millies.

No, that is the opposite of true. Nobody lost their shirts who actually held because any bitcoins they bought at the peak then are worth more today! Anybody who actually held would be FINE now. That's why it is actually helpful to remind people not to panic. Nobody can be sure of the future, but it seems like Bitcoin is doing (and will continue to do) just fine.

There's a custom Bitcoin client that has "coin control" which allows you to do exactly what you're saying. By default, most bitcoin clients use some kind of logic (I'm not sure what it is) to decide which of the coins you've received to then send to other people.

Apologies that someone hasn't replied with something more in depth by now. I don't think anyone has compiled a comprehensive reference yet (I'm sure it will come in time), but for now you have:
and then there is just us redditors as sources of anecdotal information. I've been using Dwolla to move money from my US Bank account and onto Mt. Gox, the biggest online bitcoin/usd exchange. There you can easily buy/sell $100,000+ worth of USD or bitcoins without causing too large price fluctuations. Coinbase is also a great way to buy bitcoins.
There are limited ways to short bitcoins and use other sophisticated financial instruments. I've never used them but someone else might know more.

The Bitcoin address is derived from a public key, which is derived from your private key (i.e., the "solution").
The public key, A, is a point on a curve A(x1,y1) such that:
A = k*G
where k is your private key, an integer, and G(x2,y2) is another point on a curve. Here, we are not using ordinary multiplication, but a special operation called "point multiplication" that is specifc to elliptic curves.
I am being super concise and it's impossible for you to know exactly how this works from my description above, but I just wanted to give you the flavor for what the detailed answer looks like.

I think from a legal perspective, it only gets tricky when you sell $100,000+ of bitcoins.
Of course, moving around $100,000+ USD is always a headache (unless you do it all the time... I don't). 
My 2 cents: Wire them to Bitstamp. Buy bitcoins. Then put them in cold storage (i.e., a paper wallet). Look that up if you don't know what that means. When you later want to sell them, you will have to think carefully about tax strategies you may want to sell them in small quantities to avoid problems at the bank where the US dollars end up.

I think colored coins are really cool, but I think every explanation of colored coins should explain (near the top of the explanation!) that legal entities and regulatory frameworks are still required. This is a major distinction from trading bitcoins, which would appear to work in a society in a state of near anarchy. I don't think this fact detracts from colored coins, but it should be stated because otherwise it's confusing.

Obviously there are many differences, but I would like to point out something that I haven't seen mentioned too often.
Controversially, I would like to claim that if tulib bulbs were scarce, then as silly as it seems, they probably could have been used as currency for a longer time and without a huge crash. I think one reason why it crashed so terribly was that while the demand was skyrocketing, so was the supply. If there is a lag in communication between the tulip buyers/sellers and the tulip bulb growers, then the supply can grow much faster than everyone realizes. So compounding the "mania" aspect of the price crash was also the fact that there were many more tulip bulbs then buyers/sellers realized. I think to some extent the same thing made the global housing crash in 2008 so severe -- real estate properties were being constructed much faster than people realized.

Well, the recent article about "selfish-mining" was specifically based on the assumption that miners that want to make the most money would join the "selfish" pool. So, if it turns out that doing so would lower the value of bitcoin then it invalidates the assumption. Basically, you would have a few people start the selfish-mining process, but no one would join them because they wouldn't see it as profitable to destroy Bitcoin.

I find this terminology "backed by" to be strange, and a lot of the answers here reflect people's discomfort with saying "nothing" or "that doesn't apply to Bitcoin." 
Of course it doesn't apply to Bitcoin. When you have a gold certificate, or mortgage contract, it makes perfect sense to talk about it being backed by gold or a house. The only reason we even think of asking "what is X backed by?" is because of how common it is to trade certificates/contracts that are associated with a physical asset.
It is meaningless, by comparison, to ask "what is gold backed by" or "what is a house backed by" and of course, "what is a bitcoin backed by?" Nothing. The concept doesn't apply. Bitcoin doesn't need an answer for this anymore than it needs an answer for "what color is Bitcoin?"

Well, my imagination first sparked unexpectedly when I traded bitcoins for litecoins and realized how simple that was. When trading bitcoins for fiat currencies, you always need to work with some kind of cumbersome bank account to go back and forth. So, merely for the purpose of trading (and hedging), having more than one cryptocurrency is helpful. There are more benefits, I think, but those I have yet to be able to clearly articulate.

My feeling is that for a small company, it doesn't "need" Windows and Linux support, it just isn't sure what it needs. Maybe I'm being defensive here because I started a company and we hired chemists and software developers, all of whom know better than I do what my company should be doing. That was the point of hiring them.

For starters, you might want to check the blockchain to see if your transaction was confirmed. All you need to know is the destination bitcoin address, and then view that address on blockchain.info. Check to see if those 250 bitcoins arrived at the destination address.

One point where I would subtly disagree is on the importance of this point:


I think that has pretty significant value (how much, I have no idea). Also, just because Bitcoin and Litecoin might share a flaw, that doesn't mean it will trigger at the same time. The fork in the blockchain last march was caused by a problem that also existed in Litecoin, but didn't yet occur.

Nope. The USB key is actually more powerful than some GPUs. And more energy efficient! That's because it uses a computer chip specifically designed for mining bitcoins, whereas GPUs are designed for more general computation.

I'm familiar with how bitcoins function, but for this ATM to work some company/individual needs to be loading a reservoir of bitcoins on some server (and then collecting money from the machines).

They have 100,000 bitcoins. Zuckerberg has a net worth of ~$10 billion.

Incentive to spend bitcoins is based on lower transaction costs and ease of use (the latter is debatable today and depends on the merchant).
The myth is that there is a disincentive to spend bitcoins because they are going up. This doesn't make sense. First of all, you can just re-purchase your bitcoins as you spend them. Furthermore, as I've pointed out in the past, the opportunity cost is identical whether you pay with dollars or bitcoins.
If you buy a trinket with dollars, you could have used those dollars to buy bitcoins. If bitcoins go up in value, you "lose" the same amount whether you were spending bitcoins or dollars earlier.

I like what Gavin said about Bitcoin once. He said he likes it because it is simple.
I agree. Of course the cryptography and everything is fairly complicated, but from an economic/monetary-supply perspective, it's very straightforward. Central banks have some kind of algorithm that they sort of follow some of the time for printing money, and it's very complicated and hard to predict.

If you are in the US, you can invest in the ETF with your 401k and IRA's.
What's really incredible (I think) is that you can invest in bitcoins through a Roth IRA. Think about that for a second. You don't pay taxes, at all, on gains from Roth IRAs. So if bitcoins go up to millions per coin, you can legitimately cash out your riches (at retirement) without paying any taxes, legally!

Supposedly CoinLab has been helping clients with deep pockets purchase bitcoins in very large amounts.

This is a common fallacy. Let's assume you have to buy food (which is true) and you have the choice of using dollars or bitcoins. Let's assume that bitcoins are going up 100% per day (super duper fast). You should use dollars right? No. It doesn't matter at all. The opportunity cost is the same.
Whenever you buy food, with whatever currency, you could have used that money to buy bitcoins. So the rapid increase in bitcoins should have zero effect on whether you use them or another currency for buying goods.

I think merchants will increasingly give discounts for goods that are paid for in bitcoins because they would rather have them.

The use of ASICs doesn't change the number of bitcoins that are mined (except perhaps very briefly, for a week or two). It only changes who gets the bitcoins, shifting the distribution away from large numbers of GPU miners into the hands of a few ASIC miners.

I don't think the idea of taxing cryptocurrency over time is a bad one. It's an interesting idea, and other people have implemented it already (e.g., Freicoins). There are a lot of advantages of Freicoins over dollars, but of course no cryptocurrency works well until it is widely adopted.

Definitely. One of the functions of a bank is security. A 3rd party service that can keep bitcoins secure (in exchange for trust, of course) is really useful.
If bitcoins were worth $10,000 USD each, you wouldn't just need cold storage to store 10,000 BTC, you'd need armed guards and a bunch of other precautions.

There is no tax problem with buying a house (or making mortage payments) with bitcoins. You use the barter tax code. This is what is used when people occasionally use stocks (or large assets like cars or yachts) to buy houses and whatnot.

You are missing something very important, which is counter-party risk. The only way for the price of a bitcoin to follow some equation (basket of currencies-based or otherwise) is if a central party promises to honor that equation. In the long run (i.e., hundreds of years) the risk of that central party defaulting on their promise is substantial, which is why most currencies like that fail.
Bitcoins have no such central party and so their value is determined by the free market. Say what you want about stability in the short term, but in order to be a reliable currency for centuries, bitcoins need to be independent of any central party (like gold).

I haven't written my own Bitcoin mining program, so there may be inaccuracies in what I am about to say. 
Bitcoin mining on CPUs is usually slow and inefficient, compared to Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), because the CPUs are designed for general purpose computing. However, for certain very common tasks, companies like Intel have designed short-cut commands on their CPUs that run much more efficiently. So you can think of modern CPUs as being "general purpose and inefficient" at most tasks, but super efficient at a few tasks that Intel (or AMD) deemed to be important (usually graphics processing). Intel is claiming in this whitepaper that for certain Intel CPUs (I don't know which ones) there are special built-in instructions for computing the SHA-256 hash. This is the computation one does to mine bitcoins (among other uses). That means that those Intel CPUs have special short-cuts for doing Bitcoin mining.

The reason this would never actually happen is that if bitcoins take over the world... the other currencies would necessarily have to become worthless. So instead of bitcoins approaching a steady-state value of $400K USD per bitcoin (or some such high number), they would instead pass it by very quickly towards infinity USD per bitcoin, which would just be the point where nobody bothers thinking in USD anymore.

I think you are saying that setting a cap is arbitrary, and that is preventing transactions from being priced by the free market properly... right?
Well, I think setting the cap (via the blocksize) SEEMS arbitrary, but that's only because everything is super small scale now. At some point (at a much much larger scale) we will definitely rub up against limits of hard drive space and internet bandwidth. I think the bitcoin transaction cost will be a pretty real cost... unlike carbon tax, which is imposed to reflect a considerably more abstract cost.

All of Satoshi's coins would get stolen, since the public keys for his bitcoins are exposed. So that's a good "canary in the mine" so to speak to see if ECDSA has been compromised.
For the rest of us, our bitcoins are (for most people anyway) protected by additional cryptography (RIPEMD160 and SHA256). However, it would make sense to just sit tight and not use Bitcoin until a replacement for ECDSA was found.

So, I had a short-lived bad experience with Coinbase and was equally frustrated. They cancelled 5 consecutive orders for ~10 bitcoins each (so, I was 50 bitcoins down from what I expected to have after waiting).

Less a feature request and more of a marketing suggestion, it would be cool if you showed new users how your website is "provably secure". There are a lot of issues with trust in the bitcoin world, and if you had a great on-site tutorial of how and why there is no trust required to use your service (i.e., what is the worst case scenario if your site is compromised) might be very attractive.
On a totally different note, there are NO online wallets for Litecoins right now, and those are becoming more popular recently... you could be the first :)

A few points:
1) Bitcoin has produced 0 billionaires so far, but it will. It is a technology of the same category as the Internet. Think about all of the billionaires that the invention of the Internet has produced (many).
2) The userbase is growing exponentially (and there is nothing more organic than exponential growth), so it makes sense that the value of a bitcoin would grown exponentially too.
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:01:58
It's interesting to think about the very long-term, but today you can comfortably spend bitcoins and buy more at the same price you spent them. This leverages all of the transactional advantages of bitcoin (speed, security, etc.) without having to worry about losing the store of value advantage.

That's a good question. It could be a difference in encoding standards being used. For example, depending on whether you think "this is a too short brainwallet" is encoded in ASCII or UTF-8 you will get a different hash output. Also, if you type in "123" does that get interpreted as a string or as an integer? It makes a difference.
Bitaddress and my Linux terminal interpret text strings the same way.

One thing I think the paper didn't consider, which might be considered outside its scope, is a penalty function for simply becoming a monopolist miner. The paper acknowledges that once a mining pool controlled 100% of the network, the pool would still want to transact honestly otherwise they would devalue their bitcoins, but I would imagine there is also an incentive not to even attain 100% mining power for the same reasons. Simply approaching 100% control would devalue the bitcoins you were mining (not sure how one would quantify this).

The private key is different than the password that Blockchain asks you to type in to login. So, to be concrete: if you download the regular bitcoin client, you can import a private key... for example, you can import the private key that you were previously using on Blockchain. This would allow you to spend your bitcoins from your local computer without ever using Blockchain again (although you could still use Blockchain if you wanted to).
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:25:48

Right, I understand this, but maybe it's not as bad as we think. Blockchain.info will show you your bitcoin wallet private key in "plain text", but that's because you are decrypting the server's encrypted information client-side. Maybe Ripple works the same way.

There are a lot of reasons why the volume could be low. Price stability, without a doubt, leads to lower trading volumes (in the extreme, the volume spikes enormously during the big "crashes"). So, at a first glance, I would assume the stable price is the most significant factor. 
Also, a lot of other exchanges are opening up and those are taking market share from Mt. Gox. So that would reduce Mt. Gox trading volume independently of the DHS incident.
Lastly, the trading volume is not that low! Measured in dollars, the trading volume is higher this week than in any week prior to February 2013!

I'm not being particularly helpful by saying this, but if Peapod started accepting bitcoins, that would be amazing. They are an online grocery store website that delivers to your door. I've used them many times. They also have very innovative billboard ads that are simultaneously stores. That might sound strange, but the billboards look like grocery store shelves stocked with goods you want to buy and next to each one is a QR code. You can literally buy a box of cereal and have it delivered to your door by scanning the QR code with your phone at the billboard as you walk by it.

A common misconception is that there is some difference between spending bitcoins and spending dollars. There is no difference. The opportunity cost is identical.

Most security conscious people download the bitaddress.org webpage and use it on an offline computer. It is physically impossible for your private key to get leaked to anyone this way.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:39:05
A super secure method would be to generate a paper wallet on an offline computer. Write down the private key on a piece of paper by hand, and keep it safe (i.e., in a safe).
A super-duper secure variant on the above is to use Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) method. On the offline computer, generate the private key, and use PassGuardian (an in-browser implementation of SSS) to split the private key into three pieces, of which you only need two to reconstruct the key.
Link to pass guardian: 
Write out by hand, each of the three pieces on a piece of paper, and store them in three different secure places. If anything ever happens to one of the stored locations (e.g., your house where you stored one of pieces burns down), use the other two to send your bitcoins to a new address (and generate a new set of 3 pieces).

I posted a comment.
Here's my debunking comment:
"This article makes rather strong claims against bitcoin becoming widely adopted on very flimsy arguments.
1. "First, people would have to be commonly paid in Bitcoins."
If your article is about peering into the future, then why is it important whether people are paid in bitcoins today? It's a brand new currency, of course people aren't being paid wages in bitcoin today. This is like looking at the first automobile and claiming they won't revolutionize transportation because we don't have paved roads everywhere. I also disagree that being paid wages in bitcoin is necessary for widescale adoption. How many people do you know are paid in gold?
2. "The second condition poses a bigger hurdle. For Bitcoin to become a serious global currency, you'd need people willing to lend them... ...But much of Bitcoin's appeal is that it exists outside the view, or reach, of any government's legal system."
Bitcoin's appeal to criminals is simply irrelevant. If my business accepts a bitcoin loan and signs a contract with a lender entity, that contract is enforceable, period. It doesn't matter that bitcoins are involved."

I use a brain wallet. Keep in mind that you can:

Err.. memory and bandwidth are naturally finite resources, so there is no issue of imposing artificial transaction scarcity. At the current blocksize, Bitcoin only does 7 tps (transactions per second). So, without any blocksize lowering, it's an extremely tight space for transactions if bitcoin grows in adoption by just one more order of magnitude (we are just shy of 1 tps right now).
The blocksize will probably increase, I've heard, but even if it increases by two orders of magnitude, it is no stretch of the imagination to think that the tps of bitcoin may increase by 3 or 4 orders of magnitude from what it is today (if bitcoin becomes a common currency of online commerce).

Well, this might be a little pedantic, but typically not only is your private key secret, so is your public key. Your bitcoin address is a hash of a hash of a public key. However, when you spend bitcoins out of an address, you publicly reveal your public key. I suppose this makes your bitcoin address less secure, but I don't know if this is a meaningful difference (it ought to be next to impossible to find the private key from a public key unless a vulnerability in the ECDSA scheme is found).

No, that's not true. As long as you know your private key, and nobody else does, then you are not trusting anyone with your money. You can use an online wallet like the one on Blockchain.info, and that does not involve downloading the blockchain and you are not entrusting anyone with your money.

Congrats. I am super proud of you guys. I tell all of my smartest friends to apply for jobs at Coinbase!

When you paste in the encrypted private key (the number that starts with a 6) into "Wallet Details" on bitaddress.org (I really hope you used the .org address, not .com as in your post)
then it will ask you for the decryption password, which you type in, and then it will show you your real private key.

You cannot access your Coinbase address outside of Coinbase's website. That is correct. As Narmotur said, you can access your blockchain.info address from anywhere (any software) with your private key.

I'm so confused, how could this possibly happen?

Popcorn, great idea!

1) It is only a digital currency, but since "digital" is just "information" it is possible to write down the information on a piece of paper or the back of a metal coin, and this is why there are sometimes pictures of physical bitcoins. 
2) Keep an eye on the exponentially growing userbase of bitcoins. Since there is a fixed supply of bitcoins, a simplistic statement about the price is that the value is proportional to the size of the userbase. 
3) Security is very important - avoid making security mistakes when storing bitcoins.

I don't understand. Why would you need a website to check whether the payment was sent or not? Is this instead of checking the blockchain on a website like blockchain.info ?

Do I want to be in charge of managing armed guards? Do I want to be worried about being kidnapped and tortured? The bank takes on all of that risk. I'm not saying that I personally would prefer hand over my private keys to a Bitcoin bank, but I think such a business would fulfill a pretty obvious need.

Receiving coins is safe, nothing is revealed.

If you think things are going in that direction, you could trade in your bitcoins for litecoins ;)

Well, imagine buying paper cash from a bank and then giving it to a stranger in an alley. Does this stranger possess cash anonymously?
If you think the answer is yes, then you can achieve this with bitcoins by buying from Coinbase and then sending them to your own privately controlled bitcoin wallet. No one can tell whether you sent those bitcoins to a stranger or whether you still own them.

Who gets the 21 million to start with?
Basically the mining process is just a democratic way to distribute 21 million coins.

Nope, not efficient enough for you to bother. You might be able to mine some litecoins though.
@_date: 2013-03-11 04:05:57
1) No, 1 GH/s is equal to 1000 MH/s (and in general, anything with the prefix G is 1000 of anything with the prefix M [the G stands for Giga and the M for Mega])
2) I would wait on this.
3) Better to just buy bitcoins and trade them in my opinion (mining is a very specialized, challenging business).
4) Yes.
5) No.
6) Well, last week litecoins were trading for 6 cents each and today they are trading for 35, so they have gone up much faster than bitcoin recently. I would consider litecoins an even riskier investment than bitcoins (but with a potentially higher reward as well).
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:33:14
Sorry, I wasn't clear. I mean that if the price goes up to $15 before you buy in, then you wouldn't buy (i.e., you currently have 0 bitcoins and no sunk costs).
@_date: 2013-05-25 03:33:17
That's actually pretty clever. Although this suddenly makes me realize that random-acts-of-whatever can now be much easier thanks to Gyft.

I agree.

I honestly do not understand why is it that every time a service shuts down in the Bitcoin world, the reasons why are not given.  Why be so cryptic? I think it would be a great service to other people who are thinking of starting Bitcoin businesses to be more transparent about the reasons as to why you're shutting down (maybe it's just personal reasons, but the fear is always that it's somehow government pressure or banks shutting down accounts, etc.)

The the three letters for the euro,  EUR, break this convention. I think it will be broken for bitcoin too.
@_date: 2013-09-06 23:42:44
It's worth pointing out that there are products, today, that are priced at a fixed BTC rate. Many bitcoin mining products, for example, are priced in terms of bitcoins, and it doesn't make a difference if the BTC/USD rate goes up or down (the price in bitcoins remains the same).
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:25:47
I don't think this will work at all. You just can't use a Bitcoin ASIC for a Scrypt-based coin. You might be able to use it for other SHA256 based coins though (i.e., Terracoin)

The protein folding problem is not provably hard the way the cryptographic methods used in Bitcoin hashing are. Someone might have a 'eureka' moment and find out a simple way to solve the protein folding problem, which would be great for biology, but would lead to a collapse of the bitcoin-based-on-protein-folding-computations economy.
As an example of this, Prof. David Baker's group at the University of Washington recently had some success developing simple rules of thumb that predict protein folding in some cases.

Sorry to split hairs, but I think you are not quite correct here.
If I think the odds of an investment attaining a value of $1,000 is 1% (* see footnote) and  I can buy said investment for $5, that's a good deal (0.01 * $1,000 = $10). If price goes up to $15 to buy in, and in my eyes the odds haven't changed, then it is too expensive. 
(for simplicity I am neglecting net present value calculations, but that just changes the argument by degrees)
*footnote: the 99% scenario here is that the investment will go to zero.
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:37:28
Yup. You can buy 0.001 bitcoins. In fact, I'll just give you a tiny bit.

It is an investment though.  There's nothing wrong with that. Every investment could go to zero and each one carries a different risk of doing so.
