I approached the Mt Gox guys immediately when Mark became active on IRC, identified myself, and asked how I could help.
Mt Gox has not asked anything of me. I'm not touching the bitcoins that I received during this until there's some kind of resolution to the matter, and I'm trying to find a universally trusted third party to hold them in the mean time.
I came forward because I believed Mt Gox was making misleading statements in public, and refusing to reword to avoid confusion when I asked them to clear things up.

Yes I am.

I have said publicly that I would support this, going so far as to say I'd ask the arbitrator (possibly made up of neutral well respsected community members) to decide what was best for the community as a whole. I'd be wiling to rule out any solutions that would bankrupt Mt Gox, and put on the table solutions that leave me with nothing.
Mt Gox has not responded to this invitation.

Not a writer at all (despite some people trying to connect me to someone with the same name as an author who wrote a weird IT security book), I just tried to explain what was going on without making things worse.
I have made several attempts to work things through with them privately. At first I was getting a lot of brief replies that seemed like stalling tactics, and now I haven't heard from them in over 36 hours.

It's a gift, what can I say?
