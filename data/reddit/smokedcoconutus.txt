It took 3 years to recover tho. Hope the recovery will take a shorter path this time.

Same here, they have been dragging this issue with Authy for about 20 days already... I have been using coinbase since they launch their app back in 2012/2013 and now I can't access my funds for a approx. a month now. Unbelievable..

Here are few
- There are several potential ways to scale BTC and SW is just one of them (the best/safe one IMO).
- We need to test it first. SW is a new tech and new tech can be buggy. We need time and a good amount of dev help to test it first. LTC is the perfect platform for it.

One word: support. If you will face any issue with accessing you money/account, verifying your identity etc etc etc you will probably be stuck in the mud for weeks.
