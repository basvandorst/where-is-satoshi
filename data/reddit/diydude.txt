It's highly likely that this "correction" and the run up to 20K were caused by banksters. Futures are the oldest trick in the book for artificially inflating supply and bringing down prices. If you don't believe me, look at what happened to the prices of gold, silver, palladium or anything else that became a CBOE product. Within weeks of futures opening, prices tanked. 
This won't work with Bitcoin in the longer term. At some point, someone will need "physical" delivery of actual BTC to cover a contract. 
Really, we should thank them for the opportunity to continue buying cheaply.
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:27:53
Generally not. After a certain point, it hits your personal moon and you just don't GAF about the price anymore.  
Personally, I'm just hoping normal, working people are buying up the cheap coins the banksters are obviously dumping at a loss. I already have mine.

Plot twist: wrong. I care about the technology and hope as many "little people" as possible buy in before the price goes up again when the dumbshits trying to drive the price down have to cover their shorts.

BitMex accounts for over 30 percent of the volume, and not a single BTC changes hands there. That pump shows how BitMex is used to naked short the price down. 
The second biggest exchange lately is something called "Bitforex" which accounts for another 30 percent of the volume, but nobody actually uses it so it seems to be an "exchange" set up by very rich people for the purpose of wash trading the price down. 
I'm not sure what we can do about this, but BitMex is not good for Bitcoin.

You are very jeolous because you weren't smart enough to buy Bitcoin a few years ago like we were. You're making the same mistake now.
I strongly suggest you take advantage of the current bargain basement prices and buy yourself some Bitcoin so that you don't end up in a loony bin a few years from now when the dollar is worthless and Bitcoin is synonymous with money.

We're not in a bear market and have not been since the price bottomed at 5800 on June 29. We're up 20 percent since then. This dip is just a higher low at the very beginning of what will be a massive run up. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:57:17
It is parallel to the existing system. It can exist without the existing system. When the existing system fails, Bitcoin will still work.
The collapse can't be avoided. Bitcoin was invented as a response to the 2008 crisis (see genesis block) and will show that it works as intended during the next crisis, whenever that may be.
(edit) it's amazing to me that so many people seem so clueless even on this sub. Bitcoin doesn't need banks or fiat. We're not in this for worthless Monopoly bank money. We're replacing the entire stinking system or at least preparing for the next time it collapses.

Inflation makes saving economically irrational. Why save money when it loses purchasing power over time? It is forced consumerism and forced "investment" (which is often just a gigantic Ponzi scheme as we are reminded every so many years and are due to be reminded shortly). 
"Theft" isn't the right word. "Fraud" is a better word. It's a sneaky way the rich take wealth from the working classes.

Banks create money out of thin air and force normal people to slave away paying them back for their fake, backed-by-nothing paper. When this charade fails and crashes and burns, bankers get free handouts from their slaves to bail them out. 
Banks charge me fees to access my own money, pimp out my data/privacy, and pay me a pittance that doesn't even keep up with inflation on my surplus funds.
That's why people hate banks. You seem to have economic Stockholm Syndrome, or maybe you're just the house slave kissing massa's butt because you're relatively comfortable.

False analogy. Bitcoin is not a stock. 
When the markets melt down again, it will be in large part due to the explosion of *corporate* debt, not personal debt. It will be catastrophic. It will be due to the Byzantine nature of the traditional financial system, and it will result in banks having serious problems (like the UK bank that went offline for weeks recently), credit card networks going down globally (as recently happened with Mastercard), and serious challenges in carrying out day-to-day business. 
You know what will work amidst all this chaos? Bitcoin. It will no longer be a speculative play but a viable means of transmitting value.
@_date: 2018-08-06 13:10:03


So can Bitcoin. Why do you think the price tanked a week after CBOE futures were introduced? As long as naked shorting is possible, bankers can manipulate supply. This is why adoption is the key factor. You can't pay someone with a fraction of a futures contract, but you can pay them with a fraction of an actual Bitcoin. So pay somebody with Bitcoin, y'all!

They have a pretty active development community. It's a good coin for actually using -- transactions are cheap and speedy, and it's almost as secure as Bitcoin. I think they're working on privacy features as well.

Almost every company has been borrowing money for share buybacks over the past ten years, including companies like Apple. As interest rates rise, the exact same thing as happened with the mortgage market in 2008 will happen, but this time it will be companies unable to meet their debt obligations. The next crisis will make 2008 look tiny, and Bitcoin will prove itself at that time.

I'd take a 1000 percent gain on anything even after hodling for ten years. If you're in this for the long term, these little dips are just buying opportunities. That's what I've done for the past few years -- buy the dip and hodl. It works. Bitcoin is not going to zero, and at some point it will make a ferocious run up. Buy before that happens if you're smart.

I think you underestimate the need for Bitcoin in developed countries. Merchants are getting jacked by card fees.

This has been debunked. Tether is backed by dollars.
The real story is that Bitcoin price has been manipulated down this year, not that it was manipulated up last year. Mark my words: somebody owes a hell of a lot of BTC, and when they pay it back, a new all-time high will ensue.

US national debt is out of control. Sure, the government can always borrow more money. That's not so great for anyone earning a paycheck because their paycheck is worth less and less in terms of what it can buy.

I don't know if it's funny or sad that you're calling people idiots when you're the one who is wrong. The only part you got right is that they are only required to actually hold a fraction of the deposits that have been entrusted to them which is, in itself, fucked up.
Fractional reserve banking means that a bank has to keep some fraction of its loans as deposits. So if you deposit $10,000, the bank can lend out $50,000, basically pulling the money out of thin air. It's not fair, and once people begin to understand how they are enslaved by this system, cryptocurrencies will replace traditional fiat currencies. Some form of banking will still exist, but it won't be the free-money-for-bankers-slavery-for-everyone-else model of today.

It's going to take a couple years, but yes.

The craziest part is that it was less than a year ago.
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:49:28
No way it goes to zero.  No way anyone loses everything.  Zero percent probability.
I mean, of course you want to keep a little money in the old system, but don't expect much from it.  I expect my Roth to pay for a couple of nice vacations or a new car when I'm old enough to collect my money, but it will be a very small part of my portfolio in a couple of years, an afterthought. 
A hypothetical person with a million-dollar portfolio could have $100,000 in bitcoins (that they bought for $25,000 less than a year ago) and the rest in stocks and bonds.  Contribute the max to their IRA.  Not buy another coin.  And in two years, they'll have $835,000 in stocks and bonds, and $2+ million in Bitcoin if they hodl.  Or stocks and bonds may tank (more likely), and the Bitcoin will still have appreciated. 
Anybody who advocates putting your dollars in dollar-denominated assets (the biggest bubble in human history, right now) and poo-poos cryptocurrencies really, REALLY doesn't get it and is probably in for a very big and painful shot of cognitive dissonance at some point.
Or maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe bitcoin will collapse against fiat because... um... because why again?

There's been a saying around here for a number of years that I think applies: "Honeybadger don't give a fuck."
In a few years, you will be one of those kicking themselves for not seeing the value of Bitcoin now and buyihg it. This is a regret you will have for the rest of your life. So... yeah, I and honeybadger share the same assessment of your lame ripostes.
Oh, and by the way, my and many others' returns on Bitcoin are already far greater than those of the condo flippers of yore and poised to become bigger still. You think this six-month accumulation opportunity is bad? Ha! I've seen way, way worse.

You have no control, know knucklehead. You can't touch your money until you're 59.5 years of age, and even then there are strict rules about how you withdraw. It's a total scam. You pay fees for nothing (you could pick stocks and bonds better than most fund managers by throwing darts blindfolded).
I have put way more money into traditional retirement accounts than I have into Bitcoin, but I have more money in Bitcoin than in traditional accounts. Explain that one to me, genius.

RIGHT! That's exactly why shorting Bitcoin doesn't work.  Anybody who borrows Bitcoin is a moron right out of the gate.

If you sold Bitcoin for a profit, you probably owe tax. The only way you wouldn't owe tax is if you had no or very low income and had held the Bitcoin for at least one year. People in the U.S. should always hold for at least a year to take advantage of the lower capital gains rate. 
If you owe tax, you should pay it. Like my accountant says, "The fact that you pay taxes is good. It means you made money."

So, yeah his opinion matters.

Until the Chinese decide to start unloading them. You also seem unaware of how many times political brinksmanship has brought us to the precipice of default in just the past 10 years.
Oh, and it's not taxpayers paying off the bonds, it's the issuance of more debt. That's why the national debt keeps growing. Eventually, this ends with the dollar being pretty much worthless because it is, in fact, backed by nothing.

Dude, look in the mirror. 
Anyone with half a working brain can see that this is bullshit, and nobody wants WWIII except the western elite and their moronic minions.

Not sure why you were downvoted. Seems like the banksters are brigading us sometimes.

Guarantee you they will use it, and the training consists of, "Have them scan this UPC and confirm that the amount is correct."
Transactions are confirmed quickly nowadays, and LN makes them many hours faster than waiting for credit card processors to credit the money into your account (for a fee 10x greater than the customer would have paid to send BTC).
