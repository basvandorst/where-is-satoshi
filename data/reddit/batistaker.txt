Have you used any darknet markets recently? They've become pretty big and what's even better is that there's so many different markets. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 13:11:55
Don't do it. This guy clearly is just trying to benefit from choices you made.

I don't think this movie has anything to do with the darknet.

Let's see. Mdma,  truffles, and weed. Yeah I'd say Amsterdam can make a lot of money off the deepnet.

I really don't want to put down 400 dollars though. 
I was looking at a max of 100.

Also does anyone know of another bitcoin exchance that doesn't require you to link your bank with your account?

They just want to pander to a wider audience to make more money.  Nerd culture and the hipster image has become pretty popular recently so they use that popularity to their advantage.

This is pretty fucking funny. I told myself that if my mom asks me why I'm buying bitcoins online that I would tell her that games online are cheaper with digital currency. (Although I'm in college my mom checks my card bill every now and then) Now it looks like my lie can be backed up with evidence.

Was it because it was your first transaction or does each transfer take a week? I made the mistake of buying too little my first time and now it won't let me purchase more bitcoins until my first purchase is complete...

This is fucking annoying how unstable the price of bitcoins are. I'm still going to use it regardless because I like cryptocurrencies and I'm not in it for investing but rather for the actual concept of cryptocurrencies but I hate how the price keeps fluctuating.

Are the bid prices given in bitcoin? I was hoping there would be some 200-300 dollar stocks but must of those seem to be 10 bitcoin or higher. Or can you choose how much you can invest for some?
@_date: 2016-02-21 19:39:17
I think the prices listed might actually be given for USD and not bitcoin. Crude oil is listed as 29.6 on 1broker and that's the dollar amount per barrel right now (not the amount in bitcoin of course)
Thanks for the help!

Holy shit, thanks!

Damn I wish I got tipped in bitcoin lol.

Lol I can imagine a customer satisfaction review on their website that says it's by "from reddit.
