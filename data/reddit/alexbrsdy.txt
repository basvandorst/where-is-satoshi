How is smashing something you own being a man? It sounds more like being a 8 year old. Stay mad loser.  I prefer to take action in a way that actually benefits us not something that brings us down, it was cool the first time but now this is getting old. AND keeps the fact that Apple is doing this at the forefront of people's minds.  Why not just ignore them and vote with your carrier? You sound like an angsty teenager. You probably listen to Blink 182.

I dont' use paypal,  a hacked account sent me a payment then did a chargeback a few years ago, after i shipped a nikon digital camera. i took the money out then they charged me back.  even after the true owner of the account acknowledged it was hacked to me over the phone and via email they now want me to pay the $500 difference, i am banned until then. bitcoin is way easier for me to send money between friends.  there are plenty of stories like this, paypal offers no protection and will NEVER take the loss. this could have never happened with bitcoin there are no chargebacks.

It is absolutely imperative that everything on these markets relating to the harm of children or credit card theft is removed. This kind of behavior/commerce should be targeted FIRST by law enforcement.  In my opinion all resources should go there and they should leave the drug users alone.
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:49:40


You mean the opposite
@_date: 2014-04-14 02:49:27
yeah that too. but i also believe in it. my pile is actually very small though i got out at 800 and in at 200. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 11:44:17

well then I'll take Litecoin then or many other alts that do the job better, BTC is so overhyped. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:51:38
Well they did make the changes so it's still the government. Also a lot of the government work is actually give to private contractors so you need to redefine what you mean when you say "government."

Bugs will be worked out, just like other cutting-edge technologies that become standard protocols.  It's called early adoption, this is what it's like, please refer to other _*buggy*_ technologies; internet 1990's, DNS, FTP, MySQL etc.

 Bitcoin is not a currency transaction fees are too high and takes too long, it's a store of value.

We will see, won't we.
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:44:18
I would just buy eth now BTC is shit now
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:53:43
Bitcoin is a store of value, Eth will be used for this
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:36:06
that's what they said about cobol. which is still running our banking system....poorly.  bugs get fixed. old tech stays the same.  but how is eth more buggy than bitcoin, examples?

Our world has been shifting to a new paradigm of a technocracy, as a drupal.org contributor I see how the most bright and hardest working programmers, get more access to the Drupal core. Just as Wall Street "rocket scientists" are slowly taking over the more primitive type A "deciders." These people will have access to the Bitcoin core and be able to make decisions effecting the population. Similar the present "illuminati." But would get there through hard work and natural intelligence. I think this could be a slightly more balanced future. I could be wrong though.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:31:10
