Don't confuse volatility with inflation. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 14:53:03
Not at all. Expansionary means more money in the system, inflationary means prices go up. Expansionary policy often leads to inflation, but the claim that Bitcoin is deflationary is based on demand for the currency increasing, so while there are more Bitcoins in circulation (expansionary), demand for Bitcoins is outstripping supply, so prices are falling (deflationary).
Also consider the massive expansionary monetary policy of the past few years and the near-zero inflation. Or Japan in the 90's.
Expansionary and inflationary are the same thing like falling and biting the ground are the same thing: in a closed system one generally leads to the other. But add exogenous factors and the linkage can be changed.
Not the same thing.

Expansionary. Different thing.

Can’t disagree, but who was harmed? You can’t sue someone for capitalizing on an opportunity; you have to show that they violated a law or a contract and that you were harmed as a result.

Nickleback's album sales must be plummeting, I keep hearing people say they hate them.

The economy isn't synonymous with mining... but mining is what controls the money supply. If a small group of people have the power to dramatically increase/decrease money supply, they can influence everything from inflation to exchange rates for their own benefit.
Part of the promise of Bitcoin is the democratization of the economy; losing that doesn't destroy or devalue the whole thing, but it certainly changes the equation.

It may be both deflation and a bubble, but it is definitely deflation. There is a fixed rate of in increase for the money supply which is less than the rate of increase in the size of the Bitcoin economy. Therefore, bitcoins are becoming more valuable day by day, which is the definition of deflation. A lot of the increase is speculation, but that is a result of the deflationary spiral (if a Bitcoin is width more tomorrow but a dollar isn't, I should put dollars into bitcoins). There will be a crash, of course, but the engine driving the bubble is the poor currency design that built in deflation.

Welcome to deflation. You are better off holding on to your money because it will be worth more tomorrow. And then tomorrow, you're better off waiting until the next day.
This is why Bitcoin, while useful, will never replace cash. The fixed money supply is incompatible with a growing economy. It may be a great investment in the same way any scarce resource is, but the more people value the currency, the less useful it is. 
A proper next-gen currency will expand the money supply dynamically based on transaction volume to maintain a 0% - 2% *inflation* rate, making it sensible to actually spend.

With equal respect, I'm pretty sure I get it. Yes, money creation is built in to the system. However, the assumption was that money creation would be done in a distributed way not conducive to manipulation.
However, what is happening is that money creation is being consolidated among people who have capital -- a year ago, it was people who could afford to spend $5k building a mining rig. Today, it is people who can afford to spend $500k (at a guess) tooling up for ASICs. In a year or two, it may well be that the vast majority of money creation is done by a small group that can afford to spend $50m+ on the effort.
I'm not making this up, or misunderstanding the technology. In fact, here's what Avalon says:
