STEEM is very much overhyped. Its a good idea with poor execution. Nobody wants to pay to use a reddit like website, that you HAVE to sign up for with a phone number, that you also cant delete any comments/posts... ever.
BAT is a much more realistic solution with much better backing

Why are we giving bitcoin to people without phones or computers? They wont be able to do anything with it...

I see the downvotes but its mostly true... Football fans and bitcoin users don't have much crossover. I think multiple bitcoin esports events would have done better for the same amount of money they dropped on this

Dont mine bitcoin unless you are doing it for fun or on a very large scale.

I think we are seeing the bottom now still a tiny bit further to go, lots of long term holders cant resist these prices. Good time to buy regardless

It will take a LONG time to update, thats why i dont use bitcoin core. It has to download the entire 75ish GB blockchain assuming it works the same as the last time i used it

FUCK the haters, i do what i want bitches. the US economy is due to fail. I put my money where i want it to be because i believe in the tech.

I haven't looked at the code, but i thank you for putting in the effort and making an open source shop site. Very useful and important for projects like this to be released.
Maybe use a better demo site than fetish gear though haha!

Its a shame all major Canadian banks are blocking bitcoin buying currently...
