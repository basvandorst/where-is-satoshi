Right.  I and many others knew about BTC back then, AND knew how it worked.  I remember visiting free faucets and couldn't be arsed to start Bitcoin to get an address to paste into the web form.  Because my time was worth more than the fraction of a cent I'd get in return.  Years earlier I had mined hundreds of coins (got about 7 blocks) and then formatted my hard drive when Windows was getting sluggish, losing them.  They were worth nothing back then.

We understand what he's saying.  But he's completely wrong.  The only incentive to raise the 21 million coin cap comes from outside the network, from those that don't own coins.  No one who owns coins is going to vote to continue producing more coins and devalue their position.  It's a nonstarter.

I guarantee that anyone new to bitcoin is going to love signing up for Gyft to get a gift card that you could have just as easily got for them in the first place.  Rule of thumb: Gifts which require people to sign up for a service or jump through hoops aren't good gifts.
You're giving them money which:
(a) they have to sign up for a service to use/redeem
(b) may drop in value, in which case they have to go back to Uncle Dyslexic and ask for the difference (can you say "uncomfortable")

In my personal opinion, Bitcoin is still new enough that to most people, gifting them coins comes across as somewhat lame and /or evangelism.  A normal gift shouldn't require a qualifier that it might drop in value.  Imagine that crazy aunt who gifts you a set of commemorative plates of the wild west.
That said, you know your friends/family.

To be honest, it doesn't sound like you are close enough to the top if you don't spend a lot of time with the owner.  Also, what happens if someone shows up to pay in Bitcoin and you're not there (day off, sick, whatever) with your wallet?

How are you holding Bitcoin off the blockchain?
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:48:16
Coinbase locks in the price when you make a purchase.  So any changes in the exchange rate don't affect the purchase.  It takes about 5 days to get your Bitcoins.  If I recall, in my case the first purchase took much longer, possibly a few weeks.
@_date: 2014-12-19 20:39:42
Yep, pretty telling about the OP.
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:56:28

Let's also not forget that they asked users to send account passwords via email, which raises a massive red flag regarding the state of their security.  i.e. they come across as a company which plays "fast and loose" with security and prioritizes quick fixes over standard procedures.  That's not so bad if you're running a personal web site.  On a well-trafficked financial institution, however... :(
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:28:15
You can use it to buy things online on various websites, but that's probably not a big draw if you're in the U.S.
Basically it's a highly speculative investment.  Put 5% of your savings into it and forget about it.  Return in 10 years or when you start seeing headlines like "Bitcoin Passes $10,000 Per Coin."

Paper wallets are for storage, not spending.  You create one or many and just continue to dump BTC into them, all the while they're offline with no risk of being compromised (as long as only you have physical access to them, of course).
To spend the funds in a paper wallet, you need to import its private keys into a hot wallet (sweep the funds).  Then you can spend the coins, but they're also at increased risk from hackers, mistakes, etc.
For me I've found that I store larger amounts of coins (over 1 BTC) in paper wallets and store my day-to-day spending coins in my phone (Breadwallet on IOS).  I don't trust my PC at the moment for anything BTC-related.
@_date: 2015-05-12 15:18:23
LibertyX in the U.S..  You have to get verified (simple online process) and then you can buy BTC in person at thousands of locations.  It's fast and easy (if the person at the location isn't a new hire that hasn't been trained on the system).

Credit is not going away anytime soon.  There's too much profit to be had from interest.  Bitcoin is just as lendable as anything else.
Imagine a company that issues "credit card" addresses that are 2-of-3 multisig addresses (1 key held by the card holder, the other 2 keys held by the issuer).  The consumer can use an app from the issuer to sign the transactions but the issuer has the power at any moment to "turn off" the address or sweep the funds.

If you have to ask this question, neither.  Mining bitcoin solo is impossible these days.  Mining with a pool is only profitable if you have hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest, and cheap electricity.
Take your money and just convert it to bitcoin directly at an exchange.  (Coinbase, Circle, etc.)  You'll get more bitcoin that way.

There are three components:
1. Private key (never share with anyone)
2. BIP38-encrypted version of the private key (you send to the third party)
3. Public address (you send to the third party)
Generally you want the public address on the cold wallet so you can add funds to it without importing the private key into a wallet.
To answer your question, yes, the public address is derived from the private key.

BIP38 encrypted paper wallet stamped/etched into metal, multiple copies, stored in various places.  Not too hard to setup, cheap, and no electronics to stop working between now and whenever the BTC needs to be swept.

In the U.S. it's very easy to buy Bitcoin.  Coinbase, Circle, LibertyX.
Granted, there is an initial wait period of a week or so for Coinbase (and maybe Circle?).  But in LibertyX's case you set up your account online (takes just a few minutes) then pay cash at your local convenience store, go back online and enter a code in your account, and they send you the bitcoins.  Takes less than an hour from start to finish.

There are roughly 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936 possible private keys.
To check them all at 1000000000000000000 tries per second would take about 3672000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 years.
That's 270000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times the current age of the universe.
A maximum of 2100000000000000 addresses can hold bitcoins.
With a million devices each trying a trillion private keys per second, you could expect to randomly find your first non-empty address belonging to a private key in 5276217100000000000 years.
(Note that numbers are slightly off because many public addresses have multiple private keys.)

Not too risky, but I recommend just printing a paper wallet and regularly adding funds to it every now and then.  You can be as paranoid as you want to be during the private key generation, and then rest assured you'll never lose the money to some weird phone/PC hack.
Here's my ultra paranoid method:
1. Bought a Raspberry Pi 2 with Raspbian OS preinstalled on the SD card.
2. Briefly put the Raspberry Pi 2 online.
3. Downloaded a copy of [bitaddress.org]( and [bitcoinpaperwallet.com]( to the desktop.
4. Took the Raspberry Pi 2 offline (unplugged the USB wireless).
5. Rolled a 6-sided die 99 times to turn a random base 6 number into a private key using the local copy of bitaddress.org running in the default browser.
6. Imported this private key into the local copy of bitcoinpaperwallet.com running in the default browser and BIP-38 encrypted it using a password.  (This takes a LONG time on the Raspberry Pi 2.)
7. Wrote down the resulting BIP-38-encrypted private key and public address.
8. Shut down the Raspberry Pi and destroyed the SD card.
9. Done! Sent funds to the public address and made multiple copies of the encrypted private key so I won't lose it.
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:50:33
Not sure what a LibertyX card is, but I have bought BTC from LibertyX and it worked great.  From cash to BTC in an address I controlled took less than an hour.  You have to create an account online, so it's not anonymous.  The store where I handed over the cash didn't ask for any ID, however.
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:01:25
No.  Only addresses containing bitcoins have anything in them.  The rest are empty.  Imagine you have 10 boxes and 5 apples.  Since there are more boxes than apples, no matter how you arrange the apples inside of boxes there's still going to be some empty boxes.
The thing you seem to be missing about Bitcoin is that the number of "boxes" is mind-boggling vast.  The human brain can't really grasp it.  Roughly, there are more possible addresses than there are molecules of water on Earth.  2^160 is a number so large that all the computers on Earth (*all* of them, including cell phones, microwaves, digital watches, etc.) working as fast as possible can't even count to it before the Earth is enveloped by the sun.

I'm not so sure.  The appeal of the internet was that you could find/publish anything.  For the most part the closed networks were walled gardens.  Kind of like owning your own newspaper (internet) vs. submitting a classified ad to someone else's newspaper (closed network).  Plus I'm not sure the various networks had the resources to scale up globally.

You can pay in cash and have your BTC near instantly?  I tried Circle but my credit card company flagged the transaction and locked my card as "suspicious activity" until I called them.

The more characters you allow, the less likely you'll run into a collision.  But it sounds like someone could abuse your service by calculating multiple addresses with the same short form using your algorithm.
You're talking about a centralized namespace for addresses.  Why bother basing this off the address at all if users need to contact your service to convert between the two?  Just generate a unique hash for each address like bit.ly does for urls.

Probably regular format (I don't remember), but then used the drive extensively at capacity for years afterwards.  Trust me, the coins are gone.  Once BTC hit $1000 I tried everything possible to find any private keys anywhere on the drive, but they've been overwritten.

You want a vector image - not raster.  So get it in SVG as opposed to JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc.  Vector formats can be scaled up and down smoothly, while raster will look blurry or chunky because it's made of pixels.

You can't change the value of Bitcoin.  Only market forces (supply and demand) can do that.
If sometime in the future we lose a lot of Bitcoins, we can always increase the divisibility from 8 decimal places to something higher, just to increase the amount of units that can be spread around.  This won't affect the price, because there would still be the same number of Bitcoins, just divided into smaller pieces.

Your analogy is wrong.


Is possible to have many duplicates of keys, since they are in fact just numbers.  What you are saying is similar to "there is only one copy of the number 5" which is, of course, silly.  Keys can be copied directly or (even if the odds against it are astronomical) copied by chance.

Use Coinbase.com.  Connect your Coinbase account to the bank account that your debit card uses.  Takes a while for the first transaction to go through, and then about a week for each transaction thereafter.  It's not great but it's the best we've got.

1.  As deflation occurs, the remaining bitcoins become more and more valuable.  This value counters the loss of bitcoins from the system.  And if need be, everyone can just agree to divide bitcoins further even beyond 8 decimal places.
2.  In the future, when mining new coins is no longer profitable, it is expected that fees attached to transactions will support mining new blocks.

Private keys are just numbers.  Big numbers, but numbers.

I agree with your advice, but in this case it doesn't apply.  He wasn't storing bitcoin on iGot, he was trading.  You can't trade bitcoin on an exchange if it's in cold storage.

Do not use any device like a Trezor or USB flash memory stick to store money.  Devices fail over time or become difficult to access because they're outdated and modern computers can't connect to them.  Hosted wallets are of course a bad idea because who can say which companies will be around in even 5+ years?
Paper wallets (cold storage) are the best way to store BTC and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.
1.  Buy a cheap laptop that you never connect to the internet, and a USB stick.
2.  Download a local copy of bitaddress.org from their github page using a computer connected to the internet that you believe to be secure.  Put it on the USB stick and transfer it to the laptop.
3.  Buy a copy of the game Yahtzee for the dice (or just get some dice from somewhere).
4.  Open up the local copy of bitaddress.org you've saved onto the laptop (which you still haven't connected to the internet!).
5.  Click on the "wallet details" tab and read the "How do I make a wallet using dice? What is B6?" panel at the bottom of the page.
6.  Use the dice to roll 99 random numbers (remember to use 0-5, not 1-6).  Enter them into the "Enter Private Key" input at the top of the page and click "View Details".
7.  You now have a completely random bitcoin private key and address that is guaranteed secure.  Copy down both using pen and paper.  (Do not use a printer - some printers store a copy of printed documents in memory.)  The bitcoin address is beneath the text "Bitcoin Address" and QR code.  The private key is beneath the text "Private Key WIF 51 characters base58, starts with a '5'" and QR code.
8.  Store the private key in a safe place and never let anyone see it.  **If you lose it or it's compromised, your money is gone.**  Send BTC to the bitcoin address to retrieve years later using the private key.  Many wallets will let you enter a private key and sweep the funds - presumably future wallet technology will be even easier to use.
9.  Practice these steps - including retrieving your funds - a few times before attempting to store any non-negligible amount of money.

It is currently not necessary to read code or have a full understanding of cryptography.  Users can use sites like [bitaddress.org]( to generate private keys (using dice, for example) that they, and only they, know.
For safe and/or longterm cold storage, if a user is to use a paper wallet, it's paramount that they know for a fact that NO ONE ELSE has ever had access to the private key.  With exchanges and hot wallets, the advantages of liquidity mean that it's sometimes useful to sacrifice some security for ready access to your funds.  With paper wallets, there's no such excuse.
The only exception I can think of is for small amounts that can be given away, i.e. $10 in BTC that can be slipped into a birthday card.

The main problem is that the word "wallet" confuses newcomers, making them think their coins are stored inside their computer/phone/etc.  Whereas what they really have in their device are keys that control access to their coins on the Bitcoin network.

Great kneejerk advice that doesn't fit the situation - he was using the exchange.  Hard to do trading without, you know, actually having your funds on the exchange.

I don't think you understand cold storage.  Read about paper wallets.  Make a few to practice.  Once your bitcoins are on a paper wallet, the only way anyone can access them is if they can access the paper.

Back in 2011, you could have made some bitcoin doing this.  These days, specialized hardware is all but required.  If you buy 50 ASIC miners (quite an expense) and install them on the computers, and no one notices how hot they run, perhaps you can get away with mining a small amount of bitcoin.
In the long run: it's not worth it.  Unless you know what you're doing, these days its more economical to just exchange your local currency for bitcoin.

He doesn't seem to know about mixers.  If you give me a bitcoin and then it's included in a transaction with 100 bitcoins and 100 outputs, which is the original bitcoin?  You can't track it until the end of time as he says.

Ah, the irony.  Stupid indeed.

Coins are stored on a distributed public ledger, not in your computer.  All your computer stores is the password to spend the coins.  You can update your copy of the ledger to indicate that you have a million coins, but no one else will agree.

There are too many private keys for that to be a concern.  The number of possible bitcoin addresses (not to mention private keys) is mind-bogglingly huge.  It's like trying to find a specific molecule of water somewhere in all of the oceans of Earth.  Except there's even more addresses than that.
There's no way to block people from guessing numbers, which is essentially all private keys are.  Luckily there are so many that every computer on Earth (including your phone, your microwave, your car's cpu) can guess private keys 24/7 and the sun would die before a single computer found an address with any funds in it.

Bitcoin addresses are just numbers.  I'm guessing 0 is the origin and highest address is upper right.
edit: op says they're ordered by first appearance in the blockchain.

I scanned the title as Mary Tyler Moore and thought, what's she doing with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:16:18
Best ad ever.  If only all ads were as interesting.
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:14:51
Okay, what do you imagine such a visualization would look like?  The computer is doing something like what posted, except at such fast speeds that the numbers would blur into illegibility.

2 million non-existent BTC.

If this is your master's thesis, you may want to take a few days and rethink things.  I found the questions confusing and sometimes nonsensical.  What's with all the "good" and "bad" questions?  I was unable to finish the quiz because I felt like too many questions assumed I fit in one of either two buckets, when in reality things are much more complex.

You have to be trolling.  One doesn't order a hit, no matter how bad your day is or how many undercover cops infiltrate your business.  Sheesh.

Well, I'm sure you knew that reselling BTC is against Coinbase's terms of agreement.  Not sure about Circle but I imagine it's the same.

When the reward halves (in 74 weeks, not a couple days) it will go to 12.5, not 15.  The difficulty depends on the number of blocks solved per time, so the reward and it are completely separate.  Yes, the price will likely go up as supply will drop.

Nearly everyone subscribed to this subreddit would be interested.  The general public: not so much.
@_date: 2015-03-27 14:18:24
This is ridiculously complex.  How about:
1. Buy a cheap netbook, never put it online
2. Use it to generate paper wallets with a local copy of [bitaddress.org](
3. Transfer the BTC to the paper wallets
4. Keep them in a safe place.

Some good information, but some curious choices/omissions when it comes to links.

To be fair, it is annoying to have to sign up for something just to get a few cents worth of bitcoin.  I'm a bitcoin enthusiast and I've not bothered to collect a change tip in the past because I figure my time is worth more than the effort it takes to grab a few cents that I can't even transfer out of the changetip system because the amount is too small.

Just a note that Breadwallet is no longer as secure as it once was.  With the latest version, anyone can pick up your phone and open up the wallet to access your purchase history.  (Previously one had to enter a pin.)
@_date: 2015-02-24 14:14:03
This seems to me a good compromise.  Maybe have an option to force any access through a PIN for those who are really concerned about privacy?
@_date: 2015-02-27 14:47:45
I didn't.  I mentioned to some that I was exchanging USD for BTC.  They said "cool," but clearly weren't interested so I didn't push it and we talked about something else.
