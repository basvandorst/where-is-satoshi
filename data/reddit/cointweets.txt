Easy. Stop letting scams propagate and stop promoting those that allow the scams to propagate.

Have you ever personally met David Parker? Has anyone ever met him in real life, actually seen him?
If Garza bought cryptocoinsnews and Garza took over Parkers emails and what not would anyone know the difference? Would you?
@_date: 2014-12-21 04:23:00
So his name is actually David Parker and you've met David Parker in person?
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:17:51
David Parker isn't real.
@_date: 2014-12-21 04:22:27
Easy enough, Coin Desk can outright say this isn't the case. Instead they are silent.
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:18:03
Source? I know some potential buyers.
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:26:12
Outside of how would you know that David Parker someone you've never seen, talked with or heard is him now?
@_date: 2015-05-14 22:59:23
I think we all knew then. But hey, Bruce Fenton said we need light shed on the dark spaces...
@_date: 2015-05-19 06:22:30
Garza directly paid for these advertisements. They aren't from an advertising network. That means that these companies directly paid for an advertisement to a known scammer... meaning they gave him direct money.
These aren't network advertisements, these are direct purchase advertisements.
@_date: 2015-05-19 04:52:24
Go to the websites owned by Garza and you'll see they have advertisements they paid for on them. They paid him for those advertisements. Neucoin is heavily advertising on Bitcoinist.
Decentral is heavily advertising on BTC.com
In both cases they are direct advertisement purchases, not Google.

The sorry bro but "mideast bankers" are going to kill you was pretty hillarious.
@_date: 2014-12-21 08:38:50
That link is invalid?
@_date: 2015-05-14 22:56:29
Even if Bittrex accepted money from Garza in mass quantity to look the other way while he made accounts of users his personal bank account?
If everyone keeps supporting the places that enable this douche he can just keep doing exactly what he is doing.
@_date: 2015-05-14 21:18:03
Speculation: They are going after his "masters" at Cantor Fitzgerald.
@_date: 2015-05-19 04:54:24
When they directly take money from Garza it is a different story.
@_date: 2015-05-19 04:52:47
Plenty of leaks and documents are online. Search for them.
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:17:18
Whoa. Didn't see that coming.
@_date: 2015-05-19 04:51:20
You have to be invited.
@_date: 2015-05-14 22:55:20
Not written by me but based on who said it in Wechat I believe it.
When you anger the Feds that'll subpoena everything and if you are trying to hide assets to "partners" so they can't be seized you piss off even more.
I am stating I have seen someone who would know saying in Wechat. I don't know what has evidence wise but I am guessing something really compelling will be revealed soon based on the people saying things.
@_date: 2015-05-19 04:53:02
Refuse the Garza advertisements.
@_date: 2015-05-14 21:31:00
I keep hearing rumors in Wechat a bombshell is coming that proves it from a government file.
@_date: 2015-01-18 05:54:30
I think he wanted Gyft to react like this... very publicly. Notice it wasn't a news story, notice it wasn't posted via official means.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:08:26
No. Return the money and stop this madness.
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:28:39
Yes, they did:
Edit: Don't worry Josh will hype the shit out of it tomorrow at TNBC. Trust me on this.
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:04:06
Can't take the heat. Fucking bullshit is what this is.
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:37:59
It was a quick process to visit Garza owned sites and see advertisements for the places listed in the article. Direct sources and screenshots would have really driven home the piece though.
How about it @_date: 2015-01-02 16:05:13
If you don't drop XPY I won't use your services.
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:06:33
I won't be reading your site until you remove the advertisements for GAW Miners.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:27:46
Please don't share links to sites that are pumping paycoin scam via advertisements. These jerks run an advertising network that is pumping paycoin across many news sites.
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:01:00
Yes, let the site owned by Garza record the conference. Great fucking call Moe. You fucking scam. I hope to see many chargebacks and ticket cancellations. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:12:51
Because you run advertisements for Paycoin I will no longer visit your site or help promote your pieces.
@_date: 2015-01-02 02:49:34
Since it lets you spend bitcoin on Amazon.... everything.
@_date: 2015-05-19 04:54:03
The exchange took money from Garza. That makes it different.
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:56:06
Ahh yes let's all THANK for letting GAW OWNED BITCOINIST record the conference. That will be completely fair.
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:34:07
The purchase windows etc are all served from Gyft. So... they are allowing it.
@_date: 2015-05-02 20:41:13
@_date: 2015-05-14 21:36:55
Because he just doesn't give up and ropes a lot of new users in.
@_date: 2015-05-14 21:17:45
Quick check shows they are still supporting him as of today on my end.
