I’m sure merchants will be VERY interested in accepting Bitcoin as long as it’s outlook goes up, but consumers would have to be completely foolish to use it.

Do you want bitcoin to continue to skyrocket in price or do you want it to be a successful unit of account? Cause you can’t really have both.

But financial institutions won’t adopt it as a currency or anything if it doesn’t meet one of the three basic functions of a currency. It needs to become a unit of account to maximize adoption, but it needs to maximize adoption before it becomes a unit of account? How does that reconcile?

If the dollar was rapidly increasing in price I.e. if one day a candy bar was a dollar and the next it was 50 cents, it wouldn’t be a functional unit of account.

You want the value of currency to slightly decrease. If the dollar was rapidly increasing in value like Bitcoin, or even gradually increasing in value, it would discourage spending because its a better future decision to hold on to your cash. That’s why people that bought pizza for a bunch of bitcoin years ago seem foolish now, and why as long as bitcoin rises in value, not many people will want to spend it. It has to reach price stability before it should be adopted as a unit of account. If it manages that I’ve got no issue with crypto, but I think it has to prove that ability first.

I’m not going to engage with that because it has absolutely nothing to do with what I was saying. Do you want Bitcoin to be a stable currency or do you want it to continue to rapidly rise in price?
