As Themuzzman mentioned, they are good and they are indeed perfectly legitimate.

A Bitcoin wallet allows you to store your Bitcoins as well as transfer them. Its sort of like your online bank. I would recommend using something simple like the MultiBit wallet which you can download after a quick google search. To cash out your Bitcoins, you can do this numerous ways however the most popular platforms to do so are through Coinbase and LocalBitcoins. My no1 tip would be to ensure that before sending any Bitcoins you adjust the transaction fee to a much higher fee than the default on your wallet - believe me this will save you a lot of time.

Have a look at Kraken. There is also Bittylicious. And of course, LocalBitcoins. Good Luck!

I'll go through a few options for you. MultiBit and Electrum are very easy to use and you'll be ready to send and accept Bitcoin in no time. Armory is great if you are looking for extra security and i'd take a look at a few Youtube tutorials if you need help navigating it. KeepKey and Trezor are also things to look into particularly if you're looking to store a large amount. Lastly, avoid any online platform for storing your Bitcoins, that includes the Blockchain wallet, any Bitcoin exchange and even LocalBitcoins.

You'll have to credit your account with a fiat currency and it will near enough exchange instantly to your desired amount of Bitcoins/Altcoins. You may initially have to go through some identification particularly for larger amounts. Happy trading!

It could just be a matter of waiting/confirming however if this is not the case post on their official Facebook page to get their attention outlining your issues. The support at Kraken can be a little lacklustre so i understand your frustration for sure!

Its never a good idea to keep your funds on an exchange but if you remain interested in doing so Gemini have been really good to me so far. But, like i said, offline wallets are much more secure!
