This is awesome!! Great to see LN in action. Does anyone know how Fold handles opening channels/funding channels? I used my own BTC + LND node a few months ago to buy Domino's using LN.pizza (shout out to for his [raspibolt]( tutorial!). In order to buy the $20 pizza, I had to open a channel with a minimum balance of $50. To open a channel, I had to broadcast a transaction on Bitcoin's main blockchain, then wait for it to be confirmed. It basically just felt like using Bitcoin main blockchain to buy a $50 Domino's gift card, then using LN.pizza to redeem the gift card. I think my receipt even showed a "gift card remaining balance" line, with the amount left in my channel as the remaining balance. So I didn't quite get the full LN experience. The actual transaction with LN.pizza was insanely fast and unfairly cheap, once all of the setup was out of the way... Unfortunately there was a power outage in my area, which caused my node to fail before I was able to spend the remaining funds in my channel. I'm not mad, it made me feel reckless AF. I am curious though... how does Fold overcome these issues with opening channels and keeping them open? Will users have to fund a channel with every individual vendor, requiring a main chain transaction each time? Cant my funds be stolen if my device goes offline for a period of time?

I saw that, but it uses c-lightning rather than LND
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:06:17
It is admirable of you to push forward even after being laughed at. As a merchant interested in the Lightning Network, you need to look into [BTCPay]( LN finally makes Bitcoin usable for merchants, it has been in the works for many years.

Oh wow I was not expecting a response from the boss herself!! I really admire your work and your dedication to re-decentralizing the web! The community-first approach that your team seems to be taking is refreshing and inspiring. Embarrassingly, at this point, I feel like I need a much more dumbed-down version of the information that you provided haha. I will keep trying though! Thanks for the reply.

Grandma probably understood how to float checks to pay for groceries, instead of having to use a credit card
@_date: 2019-06-19 18:49:54
Here we go!!! Great stuff. You guys are kicking ass at Lightning Labs
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:08:30
Yeah just let it catch up

This should be added [to the Lightning Obituaries]( I'd like to pay my condolences
@_date: 2019-01-13 19:54:02
Is that not how that works?
@_date: 2019-01-11 04:08:55
Maybe they're also invested in securing the network? Their motivation could run deeper than simply winning the next block reward
@_date: 2019-01-09 19:49:44
That is awesome!! What kind of freelance work do you do? Did you post on a forum to find someone willing to pay you for your work in BTC? It seems tough to find people willing to pay Bitcoin. [Overstock]( is still accepting BTC payments
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:59:58
Ok sorry, in your OP you said that they stopped accepting BTC payments in 2018, not that you couldn't figure out how to use it lol! Sorry for the confusion! Did you click their link for [more help?]( Is not a lie. Is sound money... also, you never said what kind of freelance you do! Where did you post your availability to get work for BTC!?
@_date: 2019-01-11 03:53:47
Sweep keys then celebrate. What about you?

Sounds like a dangerous game there friendo
@_date: 2019-09-15 04:47:42
Interesting point, thanks for the reply. I did not consider that blockchain growth should level out. Still though, at 50gb/yr, we will hit 1tb in less than 15yrs

Actually you suggested that he trade in his hobby of looking at rare coins for painting your house. You are an asshole
@_date: 2019-09-11 04:59:32
I think it would depend on why you're buying it... If you're buying with intention to spend and reload your wallet,  then coins already on LN would have a marginal benefit (realized in fees and tx time). If you're planning to buy and HODL, no reason to not just buy and store on the main chain. LN is still under heavy development, you have to be craeful!

If this was "ridiculously easy" for everyone, then Casa Node-type plug n' play devices would not be so popular

You said "the difficulty adjusts to target once every 10 min"... That is exactly what you typed... I said "false"... because [the difficulty adjusts to target]( once every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks)... I feel like you might be making a joke that is going over my head
Edit: nevermind... after reading some of your comment history I can clearly see that you are not trying to make a joke... Let me try to break this down for you in a way that you might be able to comprehend... [Sometimes words, you no need use…but need need for talk talk]( Please read the "complete beginner's guide" that I linked before commenting on my reading comprehension skills hahaha
@_date: 2019-09-14 22:55:56
Difficulty adjustment occurs every 2,016 blocks, not every block. Roughly every 2 weeks, not every 10min

Sounds like your sister really loves you. Worth more than any amount of money imo

Coin machines in the US take almost 12% of your deposit. Would be like $96 on his $800 deposit
@_date: 2019-09-15 04:24:07
Again, please refer to this "[complete beginner's guide]( " to understand why I replied "false" to your original statement. Difficulty does not "adjust to target once every 10 minutes" no matter how many [bracketed explanations] you add to my reply
@_date: 2019-09-17 23:55:28
Nobody is making fun of you for your hobbies. You are the asshole in this situation. Also, I bet you're making less than 5 cents an hour for your video watching hobby

Depends on how they got their node running. Raspiblitz requires very little computer knowledge. Casa node requires even less
@_date: 2019-09-11 04:02:11
Sorry for any confusion, I was trying to be funny not sassy... my comment was less about the dynamics of a son-in-law/father-in-law relationship, and more about the fact that your analogy hints that 1BTC might be ~= 285oz. of gold (~$340,000 at current spot price)! That is a dangerous thing to tell anyone if you ask me! (Not saying that I necessarily disagree with you)... It's just that financial conversations like this, with people who you have a personal relationship with, can always be a dangerous game. Not trying to belittle your relationship with your father-in-law, it is great that you two have a strong relationship
@_date: 2019-09-15 12:44:35
Haha good point
@_date: 2019-09-15 04:44:23
Easier said than done for many node operators, in my opinion

Is there a way to claim a bitcoin tip given on reddit in 2013?
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:13:26
It is downright reckless

Just be craeful I guess

What happens to those coins?
