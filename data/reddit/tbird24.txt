And a new meme was born
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:54:09
Remind me! Two Years
@_date: 2015-06-11 03:23:20
Haha can't say I disagree :)
@_date: 2014-11-23 00:14:16
No, you lost me completely. WTF is your original comment talking about.
@_date: 2014-11-23 01:37:33
Thank you. I gave up on this convo because I'm just fucking confused.
@_date: 2014-11-22 21:53:29
What the hell are you talking about? I was giving an example of a common country people send money to via WU, typically from the US. Many mexican families living in the US have no way of sending money home to their family, so they use WU.
@_date: 2014-11-22 21:08:45
Nobody is sending Western Union money to the third world. They're sending it to Mexico.
@_date: 2014-11-22 16:58:02
$5 off $50 is highway robbery.

Also learn about coinbase.com. And Gemini.com. And, you know, other modern banking institutions that hold your money for you, fully insured.
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:01:29
Some people tend to be much more cautious with their bitcoin and prefer a paper/hardware wallet. Personally, I think that's a similar mindset to storing your cash under your mattress.
For context, many exchanges in the past have been fatally hacked.
@_date: 2017-02-09 01:03:45
And the same way you learn to take care of all your USD under your mattress, right? Wait... no that's not right.
@_date: 2017-02-09 01:01:41
Right right right. And if you don't hold all your USD money, it's not your money either, right?
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:28:33
And do you take issue with that? Because most of the world is just fine with this...
@_date: 2017-02-09 02:15:59
Listen, I do understand many of the benefits of bitcoin and agree with everything you're saying with one big caveat: that the user *fully* understands how to keep her own coins safely.
My problem lies with the blanket advice for anyone trying to get into bitcoin that "you MUST have your own hard wallet otherwise your bitcoin IS NOT YOURS AND ITS WORTHLESS". It's a total hyperbole.
I've worked at tech startups my whole career, am fairly technical, way more so than your average layman, and I don't trust myself to store my own coins. I've even tried to go through the process with Ether and gave up. Wasn't worth my time or the risk of me doing it incorrectly.
So, if you're knowledgeable enough to store your own coins with proper backups and you know what to do in an emergency, then great. That's some (small) percentage safer than Coinbase. But I assure you this advice scares laypeople away who become convinced they can't buy bitcoin because they don't have the knowledge to keep it safe. And that's a shame. Because Coinbase et. al. is accessible, it's easy, and it's quite safe.
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:00:00
thank you. So sick of seeing these "MUST HAVE BRAIN WALLET ONLY" posts.
@_date: 2017-02-09 01:01:06
Arguably it's less safe. Because now there are 3 points of failure instead of one. If your mom's, or your best friend's, or your google drive gets compromised, you lose.
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:21:00
Coinbase is working on a way for you to retrieve your BCH, and they estimate it'll be ready by the end of this year.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:31:13
I think this is important for the r/bitcoin community to be aware of, since this affects solely bitcoin owners before the fork. But, let me know if you disagree and I can remove.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:33:44
oh, come on. That's a gross oversimplification. Give them a break. Gemini and others are in the same boat building the necessary support for it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:58:45
yea, totally dude..
@_date: 2019-10-25 21:54:15
Is this the 4chan prediction?
@_date: 2019-10-27 03:34:14
Why is this being downvoted?
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:53:02
Downvoting myself because now it is :)
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:43:07
No. This is a required meme. To not post it would be a disservice to the internet.
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:45:55
It's not tho. You had one job.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:51:26
I. Cannot. Wait. 
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:48:45
On what exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:39:42
Most people will tell you to set up a wallet where you hold your own keys. And that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if you want to, plus you'll learn a bit more about how bitcoin works. But... with just .04BTC in my opinion you should save yourself the hassle and just keep it in coinbase. Make sure you set up two-factor authentication with your coinbase account.
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:40:21
Look more closely...
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:29:40
I'm gonna be so sad is this sub doesn't completely lose it with excitement when we go over 9,000! I want to see Vegeta memes and gifs of all varieties, all day long.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:15:31
Although in theory I agree with you, I've been waiting way too long for this moment to give a shit!
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:56:18
Standing by!
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:48:33
You know the joke is 9000 right?
@_date: 2016-02-22 12:18:19
What would it take for the fork being discussed to cause a new currency to be created, essentially making the current bitcoin currency worthless?
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:39:42
Underrated comment
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:32:32
I have many upvotes to give. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:27:53
It makes me happy that the memes on the way down are just as good as the memes on the way up.
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:42:53
Modest. Lol
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:12:24
wild guess- hold on for dear life?
