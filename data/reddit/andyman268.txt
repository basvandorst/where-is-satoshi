Death cross and bear market confirmed. Lower high after lower high. 
We are in an ABC correction from the peak in Dec 17’ and new lows will be tested.
The price action is absolutely lousy.

Lol anyone up for a game of Boomer Bingo?

ABC correct in play - a break through $3 to $1k is a possibility.
Bitcoin has never had this price action in a bull market before (death cross).

Rip the bandaid off and just get it done.
The death cross and the series of lower highs was a warning signal that the bear market wasn’t over. I’ll be happy when we find a true bottom and move on.

Talk of a potential death cross on Bitcoin. Cause for concern?

Steve is trying his best. You’re doing awesome, Steve!

Lower if it’s an ABC correction.

Back to 7k lol

Death cross forming. At least another 12 months of bear market. 
Time to find a hobby.
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:20:35
When we hit $3k in a few months time.
@_date: 2019-10-25 05:09:36
Death cross :(
The current price action has never happened in a bull market. Tough times ahead for the future of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-25 11:52:40
If we’re in a bear for another 12+ months will you still be here?
@_date: 2019-10-31 10:36:10
Yet another lower high, despite the huge rally. Doesn’t look good, TBH.
@_date: 2019-10-12 08:59:23
Unlikely with a death cross forming. It looks very bearish for the next 12 months.

He means he has invented a time travel machine and he wants us to get in.
