What app is this?
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:21:08
Bitcoin blockchain is going up on satellites so technically it will be around forever
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:50:01
All the new utilities on blockchain. This isn't a fomo pump, this is the begining of adoption. Btc might not be used daily as cash but like barer bonds or gold. If it does below 10k, I'll buy and hold, just like every dip.

It's a DNS blocker. Blocks ads and trackers on the entire local network.

Should I run the node by itself? If I had a pi on my network as a pihole could I run a node as well on it or would that defeat opsec?
@_date: 2019-07-15 21:28:13
You should have her try and trade the btc for the labor
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:46:52
Since btc is deflationary it can only go up in value. Since the dollar is inflationary, it can only go down
@_date: 2019-07-28 04:12:01
You don't think so? You think we're not in early stages still?
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:40:24
till that bubble goes POP all the coins with real world applications settle the market. get out while it's high. no 100k btc man, not after the futures. wall Street looking to fuck us and make $
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:13:39
Don't panic!
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:21:58
The one the Banks invested in. I think its the futures draining btc and every other coin is following suit. All coins are kind of tethered to Bitcoin so yeah, makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:01:57
finally an economic strategy I can get behind

Holy crap, thank you kind stranger!

Didn't he go to South America and built a lab to discover some drug to turn women into sex slaves? Mcafee is a strange guy
@_date: 2015-12-12 03:07:15
I hate to panhandle, but don't have any bitcoin, though I've been following since '10 or so. 
Spare any change?
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:05:32
All the btc ATMs in my area charge 10-18% total horsehit. Makes me want to invest in an atm machine myself
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:31:37
For sure man, I hear horror stories that people can't get their coins out of coinbase. I'm purchasing through them and am planning on moving after reaching a set amount to a hardware wallet 
@_date: 2019-11-30 20:48:20
For real. I've had to reinstall Linux a ton of times breaking it worse then I could fix it. I haven't lost any wallet keys or seeds yet *knock on wood* but I'm so clumsy with tech sometimes being responsible for my money terrifies me lol. I need a hardware wallet and a backup before too long

Thanks for the well written response, I learned a few things today
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:30:09
Say what?
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:43:39
Don't forget London kept a great deal of Venezuelan gold, bankrupting the nation.
@_date: 2019-08-12 02:19:55
You know how in old movies a steak and a whiskey cost $0.10? Or you could see a movie for a nickel? It's like that. If you bought gold back then with a dollar, it would be a nice stack of gold today. It can still buy the same amount of steak and whiskey, where as the dollar won't get you shit today
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:12:43
Why don't places like this and Zimbabwe back their currency with btc, or gold even? Why keep this "currency backed by the faith of the government" when no one has faith in the government? I hear Venezuela got their gold taken by London and America so why don't they sell national land for btc and cold storage that shit to back their money?
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:16:08
They have a crude oil backed crypto coin.  They can't trade it but when they check their bank account they can see balance in crudecoin. I assume it's used for bank transfers only. Crypto for me but not for thee
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:25:04
We're just going to ignore innocent until proven guilty in this hypothetical scenario?
@_date: 2019-08-01 11:22:30
A carbon tax you say?
@_date: 2019-08-04 01:05:15
It's the only truly decentralized crypto. Vatelik can change the eth code, the btc cash devs can change that, LTC has Central devs too. Anyone can push btc code and it needs to be voted on before it's patched in. 
That's the argument from btc maximalists anyway. I personally think other coins have their place in the world but as far as holding value, btc is king and will continue to dominate the crypto realm
@_date: 2019-10-04 10:31:57
Yeah but I can't use a hammer to get a guy to empty his whole bank account into mine. I certainly could with Bitcoin. That's the difference, most rich people have Banks to keep their money safe.

What a weird symbol, I never would have guessed that was ethereum

Why so much hate for Edison then? Just because everyone has this Tesla love going on?
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:42:31
While we're in this topic, what would happen if someone suddenly died? Someone saving btc for their kid but dies without passing down the seed words or keys? How many coins will be burned because of sudden deaths
@_date: 2019-06-24 03:39:24
10mil per for $1 sat yes
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:14:02
Fomo dog. Shits blowing up like in 17. Once it tapped 9k people started buying thinking it would moon soon. The fear is real
@_date: 2019-06-24 03:23:37
I think mcafee is a nut but I'm optimistic about a 1m btc eventually. Think about if 1sat = $1

They'll adapt when they have to. Most of them will probably use libra and have no idea what it's based on. People will use xrp to send money grams and not know it. I want to be abke to buy land with my btc. Not exchange my btc for fiat to buy property, send btc to the person selling the land straight up
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:24:36
But if he never bought those pizzas then btc might never have been used. Someone had to take the dive and I'm glad they did. Of course it's like the guy that sold his apple stock in the 80s for a lawn mower but honestly if the pizza guy had any brains he would have bought those 20k back right away. I spend my btc but I replace them immediately
@_date: 2019-06-08 15:15:52
If I tried to use an outlet and it didn't work at all I would definitely be curious enough to take it apart. And if I found a fucking lock on it, I would be very interested. I bet you could break into that thing with a Bobby pin

Herb Chambers? Is that the cars model? Or is it just a place to put your weed?
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:34:11
I didn't get any btc from coinbase. I got a bunch of shit coins recently though. Sold most for btc though
@_date: 2019-06-12 20:42:33
Bsv is a shit coin
@_date: 2019-06-12 20:41:55
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:28:09
It would be worthless though if you couldn't trade it for goods and services. I use btc to buy things as well, I just try to replace it right away. Still though
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:27:26
Well, be ready for that Dec/Jan dump and come out on top. Move to a stable coin until it bottoms and buy back in

Hey man, would it be possible to do an audio only show? And release it as a podcast? For the past 3 or 4 years I've watched very very little YouTube in favor of podcasts
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:28:27
Yeah I dropped my alts after that bianance announcement. They heald value in fiat but lost allot of Satoshi
@_date: 2019-02-04 22:42:03
Sounds legit
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:11:11
I see. Could it be exchange wallets? That's still a lot of volume for 10 mins
@_date: 2019-12-28 09:33:09
Why? Everyone uses dollars. Don't be a gate keeper

Well.... Duh. 
Were they counterfeiting BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:56:43
Ah, got the same email, thanks. Looks like people are going to pump and dump BTC for free dividend
@_date: 2019-09-04 17:38:01
Do the seed words work on any wallet?
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:20:02
That's what I'm wondering too. I was checking them all day yesterday and this is the biggest transaction I can find for 10k btc. 
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:16:46
But couldn't it be triggered by a large sell off, leading to sell orders outweighing buy orders? 
I'm very optimistic about btc but I'm very weary about market manipulation. I know as adoption and as the market cap grows, manipulation will be more difficult. There's been good news about btc this month, perhaps I'm ignorant but it seems like this drop came out of nowhere.
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:14:45
Make murder illigal, that'll stop em
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:24:30
No, coinbase is not going to support the new Bitcoin fork. 
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:16:30
Did the dollar just get stronger or something?

Why make a good coin and then fuck it up with unreasonable inflation?
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:15:02
The smart thing is to not try and time the market and buy small amounts regularly. I've been buying a little every other week and it's been working out. And I'm going to keep trading my fiat for crypto every other week until I don't need to use fiat anymore.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:09:53
I buy overy other week. Trying to time the market is going to lose in the end. This dip though, all altcoins dropped, even though link and some others was going up the past few days while btc was going down. This last dip took everything with it
@_date: 2019-09-24 13:57:20
Anyone heard of [dual core?]( If anyone knows any other hip hop artists that are into nerdy shit, let me know. The other one that comes to mind is [deltron 3030](
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:40:14
I went digging through some of those comments and am now thinking some tether fuckery could be going on. [tether volume is 8x market cap]( This seems strange to me but I'm not an economist or anything
