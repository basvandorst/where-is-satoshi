Robinhood says they are working on developing their own wallet soon.....and that you'll be able to transfer out your btc at that point....how is that possible if no one owns anything but derivatives?

I'm not scared to lose the money. Its just the opportunity cost of being in traditional stocks that bothers me. 
Even if I bet 5 bucks on something.....still wouldn't want to lose that 5 bucks if it was avoidable. I'm still hodling I'm just bitching bro don't mind me lol

What would be the sounder money though? If governments themselves move to bitcoin, how would that work with a limited supply of bitcoin? Wouldn't that mean people who got in at the beginning will always have more bitcoin than the government itself?

Maybe my understanding is wrong but.....
Even if I buy back in immediately on coinbase.....wouldn't I own a smaller fraction on a bitcoin, since it is above $8000, which is where I bought in at? Dollar-wise they'd be equivalent , but satoshi-wise id be taking a loss. Id rather wait out Robin hood creating their own wallet in that event (hoping it happens within the next 5 years lol)

Was wondering the same thing. Was waiting on one of the vets to explain

My only gripe with this is.....if everyone checks out the system....how do we keep infrastructure? How do we have public education and lights on the highways. This is an issue I've been thinking about alot lately. I believe in blockchain and obviously I wanna make some money lol but if every single person does this and no one uses the dollar, what happens to America's infrastructure?

My opinion on it is this...
Robinhood is a company that wants your business so they can make a profit. Currently only a small portion of investors on Robinhood hold crypto, but that will change over the next 2-3 years and we know that. When a large portion of investors on RH hold bitcoin eventually, what do you think RH will do? 
They will make a wallet. Because they are gonna do what it takes to keep your business. 
They already said this is in the works. I'm betting they haven't already developed it because there's just not enough investors holding crypto at the moment. I don't believe the theory of people on this sub, that something catastrophic will happen and all your money will disappear one day. I think alot of people on this sub are paranoid af lol
My plan is, as soon as they develop their wallet, ill move my satoshis to a personal hard wallet. Until then, this is where I have my bitcoin stored. If I had thousands in it, id be paranoid. But I just have a few hundred bucks in there

Lmao....what's crazy is, you'd think people who are interested in private currencies and keeping control out of governments/banks hands would also see the absolute BS being pushed by the mainstream media. The trump slander is nonsense.
