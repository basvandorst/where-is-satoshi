Actually being able to focus on self improvement, my wife, my job... the things that really matter. Cryptocurrency is fun and the future but don’t forget the important things in life.

I guarantee this is because the financial system within universities is already a shit show. They can’t complicate it further without pissing somebody off.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:03:36
Haha I'm fine. It just lasts a day or so. Some amount of anger at yourself is healthy so that you learn from your mistakes. If you grow too complacent, it becomes easier to make mistakes. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:15:53
Hi, I am your person.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:56:46
Congrats man! Glad your kiddos still come first. Haha.

I have heard that if you make under $77,000 income annually that you are exempt from capital gains tax. Is this true? If yes, are you also exempt from the crypto-to-crypto tax? Thanks!
Edit: good luck with the in laws!!

@_date: 2018-08-02 15:57:08
How in the red are you guys?
@_date: 2018-08-18 19:24:01
Hey OP if you buy double the amount and send it to my address I’ll refund you! I just need 2-5 BTC to verify that it is you. You can PM me your exact amount sent and we will be good to go!!!!!!!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:33:26
Let's start calling him Rog for short xD
@_date: 2019-03-23 22:55:01

Sent this to my dad

I'm just saying the mining is a lot more viable. Feel free to convert it to whatever you want whenever it is mined. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 23:51:55
It never mattered. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:19:46
VTC :)
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:38:18
Yeah it works great! I'm getting about 40 MH with a gtx 1070. Was getting ~35 with ccminer. 
I have heard that the CPU mining software is out of date. Never tried it though. 
I also run a local node. Really helped with the efficiency. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:00:16
Is girth a factor? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:55:19
Pretty damn close. Needs more random half assed LOTR references that don't apply to the topic, though. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:51:04
Me last night: 
I'll stay up late to see BTC hit 10k. This is a historic moment and I don't want to miss it.
Now I gotta go to fucking work like a zombie.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:50:15
I had no idea I could get this aroused 
@_date: 2019-02-22 23:54:06
Ah, the ole’ BTC should be worth $40,000,000,000,000 trick
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:42:13
Fuck yeah

And sell those bitches for $50 a petal 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:20:56
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:07:59
I would literally buy all of the bitcoins at this price. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:35:48
Welcome back you smart asshole :)
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:47:35
Don’t buy that Amazon stock... buy our AMZon. It’s wayyyy better because reasons. /s
@_date: 2019-01-25 19:26:17
It’s honestly pretty naive to not expand that first box by about 10 months. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:06:02

I got banned from r/CryptoCurrency for posting a gif. Just had to share... 
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:45:16
Thanks for the share. I’m horrible with names haha.

You won’t have to sell in 2040 
@_date: 2018-07-02 22:41:35
Looks sick man. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:16:16
Ahh, making addicts young. I like your style, OP.
@_date: 2018-07-31 05:41:38
Why is this on this sub?
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:51:38
Do you have a txt file of time vs price?

Ive started offering the tip in crypto. I’ll add an extra couple of bucks if they say yes.

I bet we are closer to the 'anger' point than the 'depression'. At least, I'm not depressed yet. I honestly think we will be in a slump for many more months. It's going to take real, proven, functional, simple use cases to get anyone excited again. 
Last year was a complete hype train. You were either on board before it started or tried to jump onto a 90 mph hunk of death metal.
