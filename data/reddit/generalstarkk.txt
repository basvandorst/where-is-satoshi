I actually dislike the majority of the republicans in the government. We should really stop putting labels on ideas, the label comes with assumptions, which most of the time arnt true. The 2 party system is bullshit

Set up small tourneys for btc, tell them they can turn it into cash, then they will do it. And prolly buy more btc in the future since they saw how easy it was. Also, somebody please invent a btc vending machine. I want to buy funoinons, and a coke. If you can do that, id buy a lot more funionions then I really need so....Good luck sir.

Sure, all drugs are not unhealthy. Opiates for example, are almost completely neutral to the body. However, if somebody uses heroin, an extremely addictive drug once, and in a reasonable dose, they would be fine afterwards. BUT if they are IVing heroin on a regular basis, THAT is unhealthy; because at that point they would be addicted. Addiction is very unhealthy because you go without food, or sleep. Your emotional health would most likely suffer due to addiction.
This is almost the case with any drug, if i take a low dose of amphetamine to help with school, the damage to the body is near nothing. If i take it everyday, eventually there is a very good chance of damaging my heart, and dopamine receptors in the brain.
Drugs can be used safety, its all about using drugs responsibly.
In order to use drugs responsibly people need education on what drugs to do the brain, and body. Throwing drug users in jail is the most unproductive way to deal with the situation that i can think of. Its literally counter-productive to both the user, and society as a whole.

I am somewhat of a noob. I don't buy btc in large amounts, nothing over 60$. Well I'm looking at cold storage wallet methods and such. Main point, I want to be as secure as possible, and that key looks like one more step to prevent your coins from getting stolen, so where do you buy these? Who makes them? Where can I buy one? 
@_date: 2014-06-10 17:43:54
It's not the Signs fault you have preconceived notions of these ideas.

I know its waay late reply sorry haha. I said i was drunk to keep things simple and short, Ate some Xanax, and muscle relaxers, now i just took a tad bit of Tramadol. Been a long night haven't slept yet so i'll be heading off to bed here very shortly. Maybe after this one more CS game.......

It's scary you work in that field if that's your educated opinion.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:19:30
I understand haha, but can't you listen to it now, then buy it when your able to buy it with btc?

No I know from you. But other people. Why would somebody steal a dollar of btc from you? If he programmed a bot of some sort to suck 1$ off of a bunch of accounts. It's more likely unless somebody you know is fucking with you.

Fun idea, in a city like New York, busiest day, somebody do that, and video tape it. Put that footage up on youtube and you got atleast a million views. Imagine all of the people on the strip just running towards these little stickers, leaping over each other like kittens to get these codes. If it worked out that way, it would probably be hilarious.

Thanks, I didn't look that hard yet, if I'm paying for a VPN I want to know everything about the company before I pull the trigger.

Haha, sometimes I feel like a crack head. Every 20 min I'll think, "Should check the price on my phone...oh...I just checked 10 min ago"

Yeah. I'm confident in my storage method; but I would love a USB 'key'. It would just be a neat novelty. Thanks for your response.

If you don't want to read a lot don't read this. I don't know if this will be long or short so warning:
The internet is by far, one of the most important inventions, ever. All of humanity and the internet. It may be more important then the wheel, spear, or even anything that was ever invented the in industrial age.
For Thousands of years, there have been fantasy books about, 'The Book of Knowledge' or something similar, now we have it.
I am amazed everytime I use my phone, there are a lot of times that I am struck by awe. I think, "Jesus, all of the knowledge is at MY fingertips....no not I, I'm no more special then you, or your family, or anybody else in the world.
The wonderful thing behind the internet is EVERYBODY has this tool.
Its honestly one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen, or experienced.
How deep is the deepest part of the ocean? The internet knows.
What was the biggest earthquake? The internet knows.
Why do I have heart problems? The internet knows.
Whats the best place to stay at in Europe? The internet knows.
What is the most high quality TV? The internet knows.
The internet knows everything that humanity does, its the collective if you will. 
I, and I believe most others take the internet for granted, we shouldn't.
We are lucky enough to be part of the FIRST generation to ever experience the internet.
It doesn't matter if you think this is the rantings of a meth head, or just a nut. However you simply cant argue that this is one of the most important and interesting times and history.
Who is experiencing this? YOU and I.
Disagree with me if you like, but you cannot say that this not one of the most important times of history.
Intresting times....I feel we are all lucky to be a part of it.
Beautiful, really.
Have a wonderful day everybody.

I see myself going completely insane for 1-2 days. Insanity that is brought on by extreme joy. I would blow 100,000$ on the BEST computer I can get my hands on first.

I saw this at 4:20, it just flashes really quick. Is this a subliminal message? I don't know what else could be, it's so strange, it took me a good min to find it so I could pause it and take a pic on youtube; that's how fast it goes by. The flash is so weird, I don't know Russian so I can't read it
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:12:13
That is strange. I have no idea haha. I'm sure it's scary as fuck though I'd be changing passwords everyday. I'm paranoid by nature though. Glad that didn't take your btc

It is pretty amazing how fast word gets out if a vendor is fucking up. Every suspicion hits forums right away. If you ever get ripped off, chances are its because you didn't do proper research.
@_date: 2015-05-30 06:55:37
Vendors reputation, and a market reputation are two different things. I don't see how you're drawing that conclusion. A vendors reputation is not just on one market, a vendors reputation is put on forums, clearnet and deep web sites. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 09:14:07

I think the majority of people who go to darknet markets already do drugs, and have connections to get drugs. The motivations for a lot of folks are that chemicals are sometimes cheaper on the darknet markets. Also, purity can be tested, and there are organizations set up go test the chemicals in a lab setting for the DNM community.
