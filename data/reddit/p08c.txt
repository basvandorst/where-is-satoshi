What you're doing is fraud. Not only are you defrauding your loan company you're most likely defrauding the tax payers that pay for those loans (unless it's a private loan). This type of investing is reckless and despicable. I hope you think twice about your actions.

Prices will stay the same, maybe dip a little. Mostly, I think prices won't change much.

I'm pretty sure futures contracts don't expire in the way people think they do. These contracts just roll over into another period. Whereas options actually do have a definite expiry date. My knowledge is very fuzzy on this, but people I think tend to misconstrue how these futures contracts actually work.

What's the matter? Did I burst your bubble? Pop pop pop

You're a bubble...

So this is the volatility I've heard so much about. I like it. Without this there would be no money to be made. 
...oh yeah...the new tech is great too.

I'm glad to see you're having such a level head with all of this.
I'm so sorry to hear about your situation. I'm glad you were able to make enough to take care of your family.
I don't know you, but be assured I will keep you and your family in my thoughts. I wish you all the best.

Just download an app like blockfolio or delta and input your transaction in the app.
I believe coinbase also has its own app you can download and log into to track your investments with them.

But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is Bitcoin; for he makes his altcoins rise on the evil and on the good, and sends crashes on the just and on the unjust.

Think in terms of percentages. If BTC rises 10% your investment grows 10%. Simple as that. Regardless of if you buy "cheap coins" or "expensive coins" it's about percentages. Seems a lot of people missed this section in math class. 
The thing is that for BTC to see a 100% gain would take a significantly larger amount of capital than for RDD to see the same growth. That's where factoring in risk vs. reward comes into play, and that has to be a personal battle for yourself. 
I can tell from your post that you may be better off investing your money in a top 10 coin and forgetting about it for a few years rather than try and play the market for quick gains. Buy yourself some BTC, put it in a secure wallet, and forget about it. Who knows... you could have $100,000 in several years. 
Sorry if that came off as condescending.

Me too! ��

 Your best bet though is to not track it and forget about it.
