I copy-pasted his script here if you want to check it ourself. It only seems to query coinmarketcap for prices. Good job OP, sheet is beautiful x)  
Edit: Tried changing the currency, Google is asking me to allow cryptoscripts to run. Isn't that a miner ?

Hi, I would like to know more about the Ledge Nano. They say that if you lose it, you can use the Recovery Sheet to retrieve your bitcoins. What if I want to retrieve my bitcoins on another device ? What if the Ledger Nano is no longer a thing in 10 years ? Do I still have access to my private keys ? Right now, everything I have is on a paper wallet.

Even if I didn't have the private keys ?

My friend asked me if he should buy some at 3.5k. I thought that the rise was dangerous and told him that I would wait it out. He now hates me.

If I owned BTC before the fork, does it mean that I can create a BCH wallet, send my bitcoins there, and dump them for around 2500$ ? Sounds like free money.

So I can create a BCH wallet, then use my BTC private key to send to it ?

I've asked that question a few times before but didn't really understand the answers. If I had BTC on a paper wallet since 2016, does it mean that I have the same amount of BCH ? Can I dump those BCH without touching my BTC ? If so, what's the safest way to transfer from an offline wallet ? I'm too scared to enter my private keys on a software (like electrum). The thought of losing my 2.05 BTC gives me anxiety.

Can someone tell me how a fork exactly works ? I had 2 BTC prior to BCH on a paper wallet. Does it mean I have 2 BCH too ?

Anyone know how I can sell my BCH that I got prefork without exposing my BTC private keys that I'm HODLing on a paper wallet ?
