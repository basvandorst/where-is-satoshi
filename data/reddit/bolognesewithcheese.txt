Good talk, especially the bit about different solutions for different problems.

You have to make sure that the perforated parts don't break or you will loose the keys, for example when it gets hot in a fire or falls down. Look at other metal wallets and checl if your idea is more secure. Thats the idea behind a metal wallet after all, it needs to be substantially better than a piece of paper.

They all pretty much start with an empty chain, they want to deploy fundamentaly different technologies after all. Exceptions are Bitcoin forks, where the btc chain splits. The tech base is pretty similar and varies only in details (more or less). Examples of this are Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.

This happens with a lot of stable coins that have low liquidity, not the fault of the coin. As soon as there is arbitrage to be made the price will change. As long as the difference is less than the fees more an arbitrage trade the price will stay stable.

They are for profit and they are definitely some exchanges doing it.Exchanges have the advantage of always makingnthe first sale,they are frontrunning their customers. Shady but what are you gonna do in this unregulated space...

Cool bot :)

Arbitrage bots will buy on binance and sell on coinbase instantly, so the prices match very closely.

You fund the bot and you can withdraw anytime. You can also fund immediately after tipping if you don't have enough balance.
@_date: 2019-08-29 20:21:44
So it may be that the last blocks in the chain are corrupted somehow, and that blocks the indexing? If that is the case how can i delete the last couple of blocks so that core can redownload them and resync?

Bluewallet is per default custodial so your funds are on their node, but the UI is nice and it also supports normal Bitcoin wallets. Electrum will also have lightning support in the future.
To withdraw from the bot just create an invoice in the app for the amount you want and give that to the bot.

I love this App, got it already connected to my own lightning node, but now i can also get onchain info from my own node. Also love the RBF features and the UI. Some of the lightning features are missing though (funding from an outside wallet and withdrawals)

Haven't tried it yet myself but it looks good and no subscription. You don't even have to get the hardware they sell.

You have to get a lightning wallet. I would recomend getting Bluewallet (iOS / Android) (esp. if you have your own lightning node) or Bitcoin lightning wallet (Runs a node on your phone) or the Lightning labs Lightning wallet (still in beta, also runs a node on your phone).
@_date: 2019-10-11 13:24:19
You can put a URL that generates a lightning request without an amount. Its unsecure though.

Haha brilliant. What an ass.

Its very early to evaluate bitcoin. At this time not very many people are having bitcoin or know how it works. So right now the fiat/BTC value is going pretty crazy because people sell/buy alot of BTC. We also have a shit ton of shitcoins (\~20% market cap total) that are just used to trade in the market.
@_date: 2019-06-11 10:39:03
Its a market price, ofc its priced in. If you think its undervalued then buy, if not don't buy.

Don't worry mate, it's going up long term. If you are not playing the get rich quick game it is always the better percentage play to buy immediately instead of "waiting for the dip".
@_date: 2019-06-01 17:39:40
Yes either make additional on-chain transactions or send coins directly via lightning to your node ([zigzag.io]( is a lightning exchange), which is better because it does not require opening or re-opening channels (more fees) but just rebalances existing channels.
@_date: 2019-09-03 09:35:57
It's good, fully decentralised. Not many users though...
@_date: 2019-09-02 16:23:01
Electrum is compatible with pretty much everything (hardware, multisig, etc.), Bluewallet has slick UI and integrates lightning (custodial and connection to own node), green wallet is pretty good and has some 3rd party multi sig as well.

You can get special hard drive recovery service to try and retrieve anything on the hdd. Costly though and not certain that they will find it.

Hashrates lags several weeks behind price. Also as long as mining is cheaper than buying (which is still is at bigger scales) you can make profits. You could even mine just for future speculation.

Privacy IS security. If you link different payments by reusing addresses someone else might know how many bitcoins you have, what and where you buy or exchange stuff -&gt; You can become a target,not only from criminals but also from government.

The mempool is distributed, nodes only transmit valid transactions if they receive one. The difficulty is adjusted roughly every 2 weeks. That basically means that nodes will only repeat blocks that meet their difficulty requirements. Blocks that don't meet that (too low difficulty) are not propagated through the network so the miner of that block won't get a reward since his block won't be in the longest chain. The difficulty is calculated so that the avg. block time stays at +- 10 minutes.
Miners have to mine blocks that the network accepts, otherwise they won't be rewarded. That's why having full nodes is so important and having bigger blocks will lead to more centralisation. Bigger blocks -&gt; fewer nodes

A bitcoin node stores its own version of the blockchain, so it verify the blocks being broadcastet and is also able to broadcast itself. To be sure no one is sending you wrong blockchain data (for example if someone has paid you in bitcoin, you want to know if that transaction was verified) you can run your own bitcoin node. That requires about 250GB of storage but not a whole lot of processing power (can run on raspberry pi).
A lightning node on the other hand is useful if you want to use and/or experiment lightning. Not having your own node means you have to trust someone else with your money and payments. A lightning node usually requires some form of bitcoin node underneith (can be truncated -&gt; stores only the end of the blockchain).

Hold your own keys and bitcoin. Get a Paper wallet if you want to hold it long term, costs nothing. For a 100 Dollars just set up a proper Password protected wallet on your phone (Write down your recovery seed and store it savely!!!!!!). Electrum wallet works well on Android and Windows (I think IOS as well) and is also compatible with various hardware wallets should you choose to buy one later.
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:53:23
Seems like lightning on the whole needs some more work to be really usable.
One bad node could actually hold many payments for many days. So far my succesfull usage is limited to sub 5$ amounts, for that it works very well though.

You can enable to not ask for 2nd factor for 30 days on a machine.Maybe you did that? You will have to enter 2nd factor for every transaction i think.
