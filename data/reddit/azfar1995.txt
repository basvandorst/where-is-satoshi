From tracking the ip the person is in Los Angeles, postal: 90014 and his isp is HostWatch. 
I doubt you will get your money back, but if you want to still pursue, the only way the Isp can reveal who the person is if they get the Feds or police knocking on their door telling them to do so, so you can try there. Good luck brother !
Edit: sorry OP, hostwatch isn't an actual ISP, so most likely the hacker spoofed his IP.

When trading crypto, if you don't want stress and believe in the tech, just buy and forget about the currency.
