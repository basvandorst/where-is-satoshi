That's a common belief where I work also! I don't know where it came from, it's almost like there was some kind of propaganda from leadership telling people that earning more will lead to losing money because of the higher tax bracket.

I only have about 10-20% of my money in crypto -- not sure if you're talking about people who invest all of their savings in it. Anyhow I would agree that wouldn't be wise.

People love to point out that earning more will lead to you paying more taxes for some reason, as if somehow you'll end up getting taxed an amount greater than the earnings. Happens all the time when people notice me working OT at work -- "Sure you might earn a little more, but TAXES!!"

I agree that LTC is currently one of the best currencies, but I'm sure a lot of people lost money because of his advice. It's like telling someone to bet on a horse and when they lose telling them that they need to understand the horse has a really great personality.

Why do you expect it to get as low as 9k? I would think after the holidays more people will be getting into or putting money back into crypto.
But if you have very good reason to believe it will get as low as 9k, then yes selling and getting back in during such a dip would be wise.

There really should be different terms for the two types of bubbles -- valueless bubbles and overvalued bubbles. 
Valueless bubbles will crash to virtually nothing, like tulip bulbs or beanie babies.
Overvalued bubbles will crash but won't stop having some value, like the housing bubble or cryptocurrencies. There will be a crash but they won't go away entirely.

That's what a stock market crash is.

I think everyone who has interest in investing in crypto casually has already heard about it back in December. When my mom was talking about Bitcoin at the dinner table I had a feeling the (mainstream) bubble was close to popping.

Seeing these posts makes me glad I got past the stage of watching crypto prices obsessively.

Cool idea, but really not what the sub should be about.
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:50:08
But the lambo expectation came from the belief that the investment would gain value, when in reality it lost value. It didn't grow 1/3 as much as expected.
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:34:09
Wouldn't the volume be high during a big drop?

Maybe should just designate a "over 9000" megathread and remove the others

I also just bought a Trezor on Amazon from a 3rd party seller, it was sealed the way you described and had to be ripped apart to be opened. 
Interestingly, the Trezor website has this question on their FAQ page:




Anyway, it seems pretty unlikely it was tampered with but I'm still wondering if I should spend another $100 to order one from the developer, given thousands could potentially be at stake.

You mean now that you know which investments turned out to be profitable, you wish you had invested in those ones more?
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:04:21
I'm very new to this myself but I think people's investment strategies are interesting. BTC is obviously the frontrunner so it seems to make sense to buy some, but it's unlikely getting in now will result in the kind of returns people who got in early saw. So it seems like many are hoping to find the "next" bitcoin by investing in newer alts -- a lot of it seems like wishful thinking powered by the remorse of not having gotten into bitcoin early. 
Again, this is the perspective of someone very new to all of this, but it seems like a lot of the trading behavior is motivated more by emotion than insight.

Where are the "this one goes up to 11" memes?

Sorry, I don't really follow what you're saying here. Can you explain?
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:04:31
I was just getting into crypto right before the segwit2x hard fork thing, initiated the money transfer into coinbase a few days before the dip...and then watched for 8 days as it went down and came back up. I had no idea it takes so long for money to transfer.

Some subs have weekly threads that are like "ask all of your stupid questions here." Given how many new users there are it might be helpful. 
Personally I've spent many hours learning about cryptocurrency in the last few weeks and still have tons of questions.

I tell everyone I wouldn't invest more than I'm willing to lose, and no more than 10% of my savings. But I keep re-negotiating in my mind what exactly 10% of my savings is. At first it was 10% of what I'm actively trading, now it's pretty much 10% of my net worth including emergency fund and retirement accounts. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:28:25
Yeah, I honestly have no idea, I'm kind of just reading the general sentiment I get from the community. Personally, my initial thought was to put about 10% of my savings into crypto and split it about 60/40 between bitcoin and lesser-known alts, but as I follow it more I'm increasingly wanting to put more into BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:59:09
I mean, the seller still has them listed for sale, and they have thousands of positive reviews on sales.
But I'm still leaning towards chucking my (likely perfectly fine) Trezor in the trash and buying a new one from the manufacturer. 
I'm almost thinking to go with ledger now -- should I trust Trezor if they say to trust 3rd party sellers on their website? I don't know what to believe anymore.

I think this comic is accurate if you consider that it's scaled up to thousands of readers. There's probably thousands of people in Robin's position who didn't know bitcoin is accepted at steam and are excited to hear about it. And there are thousands of Batmans who already knew this and are annoyed at how many times it gets posted. Hence both posts getting thousands of upvotes.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:03:48
It's funny how people love to look to the past and lament "oh if I only I had done X back then..." without realizing that right now will be looked back at as another "back then" moment. Only we don't know what it's for. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:03:15
This is a great post. It seems like so many opinions on bitcoin are either "go all in, to the moon etc." or 'it's a bubble/scam, stay away." This is a great balance of seeing potential but proceeding with caution.

If it really is that easy, why do we even have two-factor authentication?
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:02:39
Also speculative bubbles make things gain value, at least temporarily.
I mean you're right, but we're not going to see another 2017 Q3-Q4 again. Even if we did it would hurt bitcoin as a currency.

I mean it's true that money which was gained will be lost, but if it's extra money that you can afford to lose you won't go bankrupt. I'll be disappointed if I lose all of what I previously earned, but it still represents less than 20% of my net worth. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:08:41
I initially put in 10%, it rose to 30%, I took out 10%, I'm comfortable with losing that remaining 20% given  I have at least as much as I started with before I put any into crypto. Risk vs. reward.  My quality of life won't suffer if that money is gone tomorrow.
(I realize those percentages don't exactly work out but it's an approximation for the sake of simplicity.)
@_date: 2018-07-09 00:14:27
I can see your point about Shopify maybe. Anyhow my main point was that plenty of stocks have had better returns. I'm not really sure what your point is, but I'm not holding BTC FWIW.

So my sock drawer is a bank?

I'm just saying there are many stocks that have had greater gains than Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:08:52
I can't spend my bitcoin at the grocery store...
@_date: 2018-07-08 21:06:54
These are just stocks that are household names, and Bitcoin was hardly a household name in 2016. If you look at stocks that were lesser known in 2016 you'll find better gains than 200%. Just off the top of my head CRISPR is up 300% in the last year.

I don't even understand what people on here are talking about. It looks like normal volatility. Wake me when it hits 6k.
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:42:25
It's a stretch saying he was correct when it got as high as 19k. You could argue that he's technically correct but it wasn't all that accurate of a prediction, being close to 50% of what the actual value.
