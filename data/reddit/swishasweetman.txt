I told my friends I doubt we'd see under 9k again so it sounds like we have similar rationale.
I'd say nobody knows, there's like 160k~ unconfirmed txs at the time I'm typing this.  Who knows how many are going to exchanges to sell
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:56:20
Dumped most of mine between 15-18.  Still losing thousands on this downfall but I could care less because I'm way green.  I'll buy some btc or litecoin tomorrow or next day if we see more downside.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:52:52
This^. Single character off and you've sent god knows how much money to nowhere.  I've also been paranoid about extremely extravagant malware in which the "deposit" address on wallets has changed.
Needless to say getting into crypto last year has greatly made me increase my OPSEC and also understanding of data collection in mass by companies.  It's pretty crazy how naive my generation is when it comes to this sort of thing 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:00:25
It probably wasn't deleted, rather automatically put in a queque so mods can sort through what's rubbish and what can be posted.

Interesting approach, if I were dumb enough to mortgage my house for BTC I obviously wouldn't tell them...however this begs the question....
How the hell does someone buy .8 value of one's home in bitcoins unnoticed by the banks?  They don't.

Not even, it's called OP has probably purchased under 5k worth of coin so his limits are standard.  Nothing to see here, this isn't coinbase fault.

I mean yeah it's irrelevant, I've just had a history of CB/GDAX withdrawals taking much longer than any platform I've ever used.  It always shows up but...suppose to be "fast and free" ends up being the opposite.

@_date: 2017-12-26 23:38:31
I purchased both a while back.  My ledger broke, trezor is older and still in amazing condition.  I'm mainly into BTc/LTC so I could care less about alts, if I want some I can find a way.

Well that's kind of what got me back into it, I originally bought before 100 and dumped around 220.  After I noticed it was around 1,000 I started to gain interest once again.  
I personally appreciate the tech because my long-term vision is what we've already been seeing in countries like Venezuela/Zimbabwe where residents unfortunately deal with failed central banks and massive inflation.  I think this tech can be used to bring a lot of places out of the dark into the light.  Bitcoin is accessible to anyone with a web connection while the USD simply isn't.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:27:45
Yeah who really wants to read this shit.  Like I highly doubt a single soul cares.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:57:01
Because I'm telling people to stop calling 4% a correction this morning?  
You sound triggered.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:35:28
Well considering 75% of the posts are discussing how it's going to 6,000 and I have lots of trolls commenting that have karma varying from -100 to 100 on few day old accounts I would certainly call that "spreading fear."
Btw when I say "10%" I obviously don't mean exactly 10%.  Use discretion, no reason to come at each other just to do it. You know what I mean lol
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:45:42
I wish I sold more at 7500 just to buy at 6700 or lower.  But I already lost a large chunk of money  in the 1q to time the market moving funds in and out of mutual funds/etfs so I learned not to try to time the market if I don't have a crystal ball.

@_date: 2017-11-30 03:27:09
They didn't reply because it's probably a scam, I was really hoping you paid via a card just because you could dispute.  :/
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:44:45
Your 100% right negativity isn't good for anyone, however I believe accounts that are ~1 week old or negative karma posting baseless junk to scare others have a predetermined opinion.  They don't care about discussing why the dip is happening or speculating what will happen next, just posting baseless FUD posts about how it's going to 5k which is junk.

@_date: 2017-11-10 16:18:20
Classic investing definition correction is 10%.  Personally I say 15-25% for crypto and we didn't enter that.
I do know what a correction is, thank you very much.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:46:01
Since 1400 here.  I guess your starting to get my drift though, I just have a problem with people over reacting to price whether good or bad.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:38:22
Awesome, looking forward to listening to a few of these after dinner.  ����
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:04:38
I agree with what your saying but a dip has nothing to do with "the high being in."  There's still an influx of Wall Street money to come in, once CME futures start actively trading we'll see a pump as well.  
I think I've seen 3 big dips this year, I don't think ~300$ at the time of me commenting is one of them.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:45:34
It's dropped like $200 this morning.  Stop calling that a correction lol

I'm not one of those people who blabs OOH all time high every time it peaks because I know there is ups and downs it's the name of the game.  For me the price yesterday was around 7200-7300  I go by the daily average, not something  that held for a probably under an hour.  10% is basic investing definition of correction so that's what I went with
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:00:46
Maybe not done your right, but I don't care honestly. If it continues treading lower I'll probably put a few orders in.
Spikes don't make me happy and dips don't make me sad

Yeah your right ;p
If we hit 6k I'll pawn some AMD shares.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:23:12
Your right, so it probably won't have much effect at all it's already priced in.  there have been record number of sign ups recently that lead me to be extremely bullish still.  I have hopes for widespread adoption in countries with high inflation rates such as Zimbabwe/Venezuela.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:47:50
Oh Fuck off, lol I never said the price isn't going lower.  I stated people should "shut up" about a correction early this morning when it was only down 4%.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:54:00
I wouldn't be shocked if some people who bought in the past month or so have exited positions.  Crypto is a different type of investing not for everyone

Still not a smart idea.  Idc if your up 2k a coin.  This type thing also reflects horribly upon our community.  Let's all max our credit cards to buy BTC!  Man that'll help us with the already bad press we're getting, doesn't seem or look shady or all.

Don't listen to anyone's prediction of the value, their all pulling shit out of air and lying if they claim otherwise.
I feel safe that it will hold where it is and go up, however if it does dip down a little more it will go up.
If your in it, you should be because it will go up.  So buy buy buy

The ETF investors pay a premium because their public Joe who either a) doesn't want to learn how to use crypto b) too complicated c) scared of crypto, but stocks and etfs are cool...
However the ETF being sold at a premium does signify the demand for investing in such a platform.  I believe the SEC has even put out statements about them, although I'm no huge government fan that thing is a piling heap of shit.

GGG looked off the first few rounds but after that I think he looked his normal dominant self although he was a little slowed down.
He was headhunting all fight because throwing body blows opens you up more.  I still think GGG should have won easily.  The first judge had 118-110 Canelo that's an absolute joke nobody should have had that many more points in the fight

@_date: 2017-09-19 01:40:13
I don't think a lot of people share OP's viewpoint that BTC will be adopted as a major fiat currency.  It doesn't need this to thrive.  As long as it remains a popular value storage asset people will continue to pump money into it.  People will continue to manipulate it, but there are people to buy those dips to send it back up.  We just saw with all the selling last week extreme resistance around the 3k mark which helped send it back to where it needs to be.  This isn't just something that will go to 0 overnight even if it is an extremely volatile asset.
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:58:26

I think GGG won tbh.  He looked off the first 3 rounds but after that in my opinion he was dominating.  Canelo's speed was slowly withering away and he was able to walk through anything he threw to land his power punches.  That's a big indicator for me Canelo isn't hitting as hard as some think

I took a large bite at 3600 and I'm tempted to get more lower or maybe bite up a few Alts
I feel like a lot of the people here have only seen uptrends.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:44:56
It's only been what 4 days?  I'm not a fan of this either but what goes up must come down, and if it follows the history of trends it goes back up
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:48:55
I saw 2998 before almost hitting 3400

After a maxed purchase or two and verification they should give ya 10.  Call and ask

Yes, but move it to a private wallet after

Really good post.  I've thought about the same thing that people will buy up USD on the cheap.  However I think some of the larger players may throw some money into cryptos, but the mass majority of people probably USD

Two years ago one of my courses was on startups and innovation.  The professor constantly harped on not just looking for break through that make life easier, but also disruptive technology that will shake up current sectors/or ways of doing business.
Bitcoin is both, which is the beauty of it.

Hey I have a q, I stored my btc on a trezor and while advising my friend to get one he hasn't yet made the jump.  What wallet should I suggest to him for the upcoming fork?  I've been hounding him to get a hardware wallet but it doesn't seem like he'll listen 
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:48:33
Go first and I got you.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:39:13
If you feel confident (or not afraid) you could make a play or two and get it back yes, otherwise stupid as hell.
I was in a similar position a few years ago, had money from stocks/funds/family and won about 7k+ from sports bets so I had no clue what the fuck to do with it but blow it 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:41:06
As the OG Peter Lynch would say don't try to time the market.
Don't need the money at the moment, I treat it like a fund, so selling it would make no sense
Oh and third point, my ROI still has far exceeded my losses and I believe it will bounce back
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:42:46

Uhh wait what?
Why does it matter if you pay in BTC or cash?  Why would he care if his landlord made returns wouldn't that help him....? ��
The tenet isn't paying more....your paying $1000 USD worth of either BITCOIN or CASH a month so wtf is the difference.....?
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:42:49
Don't use them then?
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:24:11
I wasn't suggesting bitcoin lol but I don't think printing a large wad of cash and sending it anywhere should qualify as relief.

If your going to make some claims how about a TA chart, some numbers, hell something.  Just grab a damn chart off trading view.  Why would anyone take you seriously when your just spewing crap that's completely baseless.  They don't even have to view your horrific previous post history...
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:32:46
Honestly I moved at least 1 BTC to gambling sites to avoid the crash.  I knew I'd gamble with it eventually, will avoid fees selling, and can get back in the market whenever with the same amount of USD.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:24:36
I'm seeing $3580 down like $220 in an hour.
I'd put a few buy orders in but probably pick some up at $3400-3500 just in case it doesn't test the waters you want to swim in

It's a gift you'll or he will pay capital gains tax when he sells which he won't because you'll tell him to hold

So you used the send as gift option?
PayPal doesn't authorize such transactions so if you tell them what happened it'll be voided.

You didn't really present an argument for bitcoin killing the real estate market.

I'm not interested in the futures I'll worry about splitting later, no replay protection right now.  I'm just curious when it'd be safe to move anything.  I'd like to just scale out a small portion.  I have dividend payments upcoming and will buy back plenty

FYI if you file a claim with PayPal you'll get the money back.  Pm me if you need info, I had someone who actually pmed me looking to do the reverse (buy my btc via PayPal) and I quickly declined when I realized how quickly you can recover the money.  Your not out of luck yet
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:26:00
Asking for a friend actually, was just curious about the ledger as well myself
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:21:32
I've never once had problems besides a couple few min waits which is normal.....yeah their fees suck but if I'm buying it's to hold and hopefully make profit plus it's convenient so I don't care. 
I haven't really ever "cashed out" because I'm treating BTC is like a fund and acquiring as much as possible but I did sell $500 of gambling profits once and the fees weren't that bad I'm sure it's worse for higher amounts so unless your trading swings just hold it
@_date: 2017-09-19 01:47:44

I get it's used for payroll and accounting purposes, but I can't help but feel whenever piles of cash are sent somewhere it doesn't always end up in the right hands.  
 I'm not sure what the answer to the problem is, I'm not a world leader who has the authority to make such decisions.  All I know is that I would have been more proactive in our response than the current administration was 
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:56:16
I've seen the posts discussing how to tell if it has been used before or not but I cannot find them at the moment :/
Very appreciated, thanks for helping

Your fine I shouldn't have been so sensitive, just the "people understand" quote kinda got me.
I don't even use credit cards hardly tbh, my personal I keep a balance of probably under $100 on, I'll run my business one up but I promptly pay the balance every month.  For a lot of stuff nowadays I still use straight cash
I hope your gamble goes well, it's just not for me and I don't think it's a good option for lots of people.
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:16:59
Thanks man, I had a few small transactions I was waiting on to go through.  Will definitely use again
