Not all of Jeff bezos or even other billionaires have just money in banks tho, they invest in so many different and illiquid assets

Better of buying dogecoin

It’s the same thing, someone has to buy so someone is selling at that price.
If people think bitcoin is worth 400,000 then people will pay that much for it. ( remember also you don’t need to own a full bitcoin, so people probably won’t have a full bitcoin when it’s worth 400,000 as a lot will sell way before that)

That’s not really lost lost because you could just deposit and then withdraw all of it?

It’s probably only targeting people who already know what bitcoin is / shown a interest in it.
So not really free marketing

Tbh it all comes down to you and how much risk you want to take. No one knows bitcoin is going to do next, if you wanted you could have a sell point at 9.5k and hope that it doesn’t go beyond that and there is a dip so you can buy back at a lower price but that might never happen and i have tried to do that before and just ended up losing so for me, I’m just buying every time it dips ( so rn) and I have a some money saved up incase it drops to lower than 6k ( so I can cost average )

I would say yeah that’s one of the reasons, advertisers need to buy bat to have ads. Have you tried using the browser? It’s actually genuinely a lot faster than anything else out there and brave is one of the few crypto companies out there with a working product.

If you’re getting in to bitcoin, just buy and hold.
There’s no point trying to day trade or trying to time the market, just today btc went above 9k and then down by 500 so it’s just too speculative.
if you want to day trade or just play around then invest in some alt coins instead and you can trade them. ( I would still hold them for a little while tho)

I would say bat has utility...

Well was there a legitimate reason for the pump? Not really
