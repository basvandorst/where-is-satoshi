**Who** is behind Bitcoin?: Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, but no one is sure exactly who that is, it could be a group of people or an individual. One clue about Satoshi is that he may have a populist sense, he wrote this into the genesis block, or the first batch of bitcoins ever produced: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks." Although there may be no connection between the headline and his political beliefs the choice seems suspect. Then go on to talk about Hal and interview him.
 
**What** did he create, what is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a currency which allows merchants to avoid banks and their fees, allowing the merchants to pass the savings to consumers.
**When** did this all happen: The genesis block or first batch of bitcoins was mined, or uncovered, January 2009 and bitcoin has been roaring forward ever since. 
**Where** does bitcoin exist: Bitcoin exists in the blockchain, a very long string of numbers. Bitcoin owners have a private key and a public key. The public key is used to receive bitcoin from other users. It is useful to hand out to receive donations or exchange goods. The private key is used to send bitcoins. It gives owners access to their coins, it should be kept secret like an atm pin, but even more secret because their is no bank to refund you and because these keys aren't linked to an identity, no one knows who stole them when they are sent to a new public key.
**Why** is bitcoin still around after all this time?: Bitcoin is still around because it is useful. There is value in anonymity and transactions between users over long distances that don't require a fee.
**How** is this all being done: Miners are what sustains the bitcoin network. Miners attempt to uncover the remaining bitcoins that are yet to be found. As they attempt to find them they validate transactions that have already taken place. It's a system that's self sustaining.

It would be cool if they gave out satoshis instead.

Thank you! Very helpful!

Just pointing out that your logic is failing you .
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:43:00
Oh trust me, most of these regulations are not stupid: see no depression since 1929; see also the great recession soon after many regulations were repealed in the mid-late 90's.
@_date: 2014-03-25 00:23:30
Which state is most bitcoin exchange friendly if I wanted to start one tomorrow?
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:12:42
Strengthening of the dollar. All commodities are down. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:44:29
Coin setter?

Also, where you will have the least distractions. Distractions destroy.

In the US this is a seizure not a detainment and it's allowed jn the airport because safety and people expect it
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:22:55
Great schools. Wherever you can do better, and not get depressed. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:40:51
Puts all the risk on the buyer, not very good customer service. I'm currently sitting on a 500 dollar loss because of it, I think I'm done with their service. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 04:13:26
But at this point hasn't the code already passed to the buyer, the seller has no recourse for the *buyer using the code and lying that it didn't work.
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:16:02
Another law student here. Graduating in a month from top 30 school, no job prospects, already regret it. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:49:54
reread my post, and then think about that again.
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:32:57
dollar is improving, tapering, all commodities including bitcoin are down
@_date: 2014-03-29 05:06:48
There is only one way, get the party which accepts the code involved, but it will happen, they have no incentive to letting people resell their codes. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:15:20
Here is my thesis on making bitcoin reach its potential:
We need to start at the grassroots. We need companies to employ people to get on the ground in places like south america and india. There they can sell american products to people using bitcoin avoiding bank fees and conversion fees. 
Companies like toyota lose billions because of exchange rate, we need a toyota-like, exchange rate dependent company to go all in on bitcoin. 
If someone can make these two things happen, we got this. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 21:49:32
bye bye 500

What if the code was already spent?
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:02:31
Past performance does not guarantee future results!
@_date: 2014-04-19 17:15:34
How about actually making deposits and withdrawals within 24 hours. 
I had to wait 24 hours for a deposit from coinsetter. Now I am waiting 48 for a withdrawal.
@_date: 2016-06-26 14:58:20
Wow, you have to be a non-lawyer. Judges are the most economical thing we have in the legal world. The caseload each judge handles is enormous. Furthermore, when judges get it wrong, it isn't always a bad thing. It allows for precedent to change. Who the hell wants the same result every time. We wouldn't have gay marriage throughout the U.S. right now if it were not for judges disagreeing on the right answer. Bottom line, replacing judges is the dumbest thing I've ever read.
@_date: 2013-05-01 03:58:56
This is generally good advice as most of the things you will see on the chart are attempts at manipulation. However, there are some things to observe long term that anyone with a stake in the game should be aware of. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:52:41
You never know, but I wouldn't hold my breathe!
Edit: grammar mistake
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:16:54
actually found a better way, you can go to preferences in bitcoinity and choose for them to only show you trades over a certain number of btc. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 03:56:15
Just speculation, but I have a feeling this will all end with bitcoins near 140 again. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 05:19:31
Minimum bet is .1 bitcoin? That's over 11 US dollars. You can get lower at live casinos. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:37:07
Hey guys, I'm looking to possibly open a store what are some things that people around the world are looking to buy from the US that would be worth the cost of international shipping?

Would play but I don't own minecraft :(
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:09:35
yeah, I have a sell order in that I cancelled, but I hope it went through first, the lag in combination with the cancel button getting disabled in unbearable. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:48:08
This would be a great way to kill it forever
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:08:14
so how it works is... create wall... entice tons of buyers by making them think that the price is going to go up....sell off massive amounts?
Since this sounds very conceivable I assume you know a little about forex, any books you can suggest, I'm interested. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 02:01:25
Also avoid Playtin
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:22:36
Start here: 
and congrats I'm hoping my bitcoin investment will get me a few hundred.
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:11:48
Too risky, even if you create a limit, I assume a botnet would be able to exploit. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:16:29
No but I'm sure that will be a reality in the future.
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:03:23
So if I put in a sell order of 4k right now those wouldn't be my bitcoins?
edit: my dollars
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:38:31
Hahaha this is very true!
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:34:31
This sounds really cool
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:04:43
So people are just trading blindly? That does not make sense. How are the big players deciding their moves right now?
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:44:10
Buy wall at 100 is now 4k buddy
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:59:36
If you see infrastructure developing, like bitcoin atms, apps, stores accepting bitcoin, that's a good sign. If not, that's a bad sign. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:42:18
when you have millionares and billionares talking about putting a percentage of their portfolio in bitcoins, thats what you are going to get. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:50:54
Now is the time for the media to create another bubble...fyi I'm long on bitcoin, but here we go again with the media
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:51:20
Yup that guy is right! Listen to him
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:12:19
I agree, I remember the 18 year old me being pissed that my parents would see my credit card statement like that, always stopped me. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 00:54:19
Awesome designs, I have a big project planned. When i get the funds together in a few years I will keep you in mind. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 03:18:55
I expect that people are already working on ways to get bitcoin into this demographic's hands safely. However, I imagine it's a long way off, so maybe it's a little premature to start accepting them. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:15:23
oh, my mistake, I apologize 
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:58:45

yes sir, could see 300 tonight
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:36:12
yup, I sold, waiting for the inevitable collapse when this news spreads. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:30:37
I am aware, and it was a joke. You can go to a local starbucks and see the difficulty in keeping up with transactions. They are lucky to get 10 transactions done in a minute. 
I'm waiting for the day when you order off your phone while connected to their network, while waiting in line and it is immediately withdrawn from your starbucks card.

Of course, there can be long term manipulation as well.

You have to understand that bitcoins are released at a certain rate no matter how many people are "mining"
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:36:16
Beyond that the source is incredibly biased. These people make their money in silver.
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:16:48
Mine isn't going through either, I'm guessing they are backed up

You were right, even Colbert's negativity had little effect on price. I am surprised, and I must give credit where it is due, you were right.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:02:57
So you think that this will give more people confidence in bitcoin. Ok, I'll take the opposite stance we'll see where it is in the morning.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:58:01
wow I wish I had watched this before deciding to spend over 200 on less than one bitcoin. At least I have my lessons learned.

jesus dude, sorry
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:51:13
it's sad that people on fox business knew much more than him the day before the crash, but comedy central couldn't get them on. It's probably a network thing.

hmmm when was the last time i saw this...

Yeah I've been seeing way to many of these posts.
@_date: 2013-04-20 06:19:22
My strategy was to play on the news surrounding bitcoin. I lost on the bitfloor closing. I thought that would drive down the price, so I sold. Then    the Western Union thing came out and boom, before I have a chance to buy I had lost all my gains.
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:57:17
I think that's exactly what it is. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 07:20:28
This is true for everything surrounding bitcoin. Make it easier and safer and everyone will be doing it. Right now people of modest intelligence can't even wrap their head around it. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 04:27:52
I went this route for bitstamp, and it worked.
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:09:29
I wish I knew what the demand was for this because I am relatively close to someone high up in a wine distributing company. I would need real info to bring something as wild as bitcoin to him as he is older and would laugh at this idea without real numbers.

I'm also looking for a place watch live. Anyone know of one?
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:57:39
3k appeared pretty much instantly the rest filled in. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:58:46
I know someone who would be interested in doing this as well.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:22:06
Interesting, I was just reading about a local lawyer who hated the practice of law, she read a book on investing, and opened a money management firm, managing million dollar accounts. Since I enjoyed this whole bitcoin run so much, I can honestly see myself doing that if the book sparks my interest. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:59:21
Nice Source!

That site seems down
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:47:25
Now if we can ban the spammers and the manipulators(buy buy buy, hold hold hold, sell sell sell bs)
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:05:26
A good way to improve would be offer promotions and incentives, along with a really strong pr campaign that attempts to show that everything is legit. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:23:28
Please do this!
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:22:59
I read the bitcointalk forum, this site seems sketchy at them moment. Seems that they might not have all the functions working and that they might be insolvent.

Still holding, and yes it is very early, and I'm excited that a lot of VC types are starting to buy in. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:24:52
and I agree it will happen again with bitcoin, maybe tonight even. I see a lot of utility. I think it's completely undervalued right now because people are scared. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 02:56:51

@_date: 2013-04-12 00:37:01
Yup, and I bet you think that mt.gox opening could be a disaster, or could just prop it up to the 160 zone where you would contemplate selling again. I think we are twins.

I actually think it is really cool. The people benefiting from mining are young and ambitious. People being held back by mega corporations in the US. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 01:49:47
Thanks for confirming this. Many people have offered to help mtgox, it's almost as if they want to keep it this way as a method of controlling price. Can't go up too fast, and it can't go down too fast. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:37:44
Yup, personally I bought and sold 6 times last night in order to make .2 bitcoins. Doesn't seem like a lot but if/when it goes back to 100 that's 20 bucks.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:17:17
why buy when it seems like it will go lower?
@_date: 2013-05-01 03:32:48
If it really is you, you are making someone very rich with bitcoins, and someone is buying just as much as you are selling.

Mt.gox volume is 206,019 BTC right now. Wasn't it 56,000 1 day ago?
Isn't that a huge change in volume?

@_date: 2013-04-16 03:20:49
don't trust buy walls, this is a lesson I've learned very fast, they are usually the same people selling later, hoping the price will jump. I'm going to start thinking of them as bye, walls. Meaning get out when you see them. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:37:46
it rounds
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:23:56
arbitrage in my opinion
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:02:18
Oh wow then this website is actually much worse than I thought. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:04:45
I assume it's people who bought in yesterday when it was at 60 looking to double their money before another huge negative media blitz. 
And I think they will come down if 15 sticks for another 12 hours. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 04:07:09
Of course it would, but it's going to take feet on the ground. An organization needs to be put in place, we need meetings, volunteers, awareness drives, media solicitation. I have skills to help accomplish this. These are all skills I've attained by being involved in American politics. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:30:02
30 seconds? I lost 20 bucks because it lagged for 11 minutes
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:58:58
I'll upvote that was a bad mistake, I appreciate the constructive criticism. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:45:28
I was making a point about how fast it was going down. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:21:37
thanks, but for the second part of my post, what do the lines mean? the red and yellow
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:03:05
Down is my guess but seriously, it's only a guess, seems like mtgox might go down soon also. Please make your own decision ignore this subreddit advice.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:12:57
would have bought more but dwalla takes forever to authorize

@_date: 2013-04-15 00:30:00
Hahaha I have been to one in NYC that has an employee at the register that really gets the line moving. I was going to put 25, but I felt like no one would believe me. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:05:27
25, student, bought in with 200 dollars when it was above 200. I still hold the currency, it's just worth 1/4 of the value.
However, wouldn't trade the experience for the world.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:10:54
It pretty much determines the market price you would be stupid not to.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:03:54
It's more than that,  but that's beside the point, there is less of a wall to get down to 100.
@_date: 2013-04-23 02:00:55
my problem with this is that I am essentially paying the bitspend fee and the credit card fee as the credit card fee is already included in the price. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:23:17
Thanks so much, I agree 1000%. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:15:53
yeah I don't know why anyone is buying right now shit is about to drop fast. yet I'm still seeing big buy orders.

@_date: 2013-04-14 04:16:19
To me it just seems a little risky when the price is 101.00 and the 4k wall is at 100. We've seen people sell off very quickly.
