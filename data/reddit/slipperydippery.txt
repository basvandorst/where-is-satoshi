Yeah, I would have Wallstreet / Big banks as the sabertooth, and maybe the spear as BTC.

I thought the dude with the spear would be BTC

**Don't keep your Bitcoin in a Mycelium wallet!**
You shouldn't keep more money in a hot wallet than you would paper cash in a regular wallet. At the very least get a paper wallet, but I would recommend getting a hardware wallet. It's a small investment to make to keep a lot of value safe.

A killer app is generally an app that promotes huge success of the underlying technology through mass adoption. e.g.: The digital spreadsheet (like Excel) was the killer app for early PC's since companies would buy PC's just to run that software. 
I don't think that Ransomware or Darknet markets are going to ever by a reason why the mainstream will want to start converting currency to Bitcoin. 
Capital controls could be a reason why some people make the switch, but I doubt that many people think about capital controls that much, and I don't think that capital controls are always a bad thing.

I think it's better to spend your time researching crypto's and markets and approaching it like a focus investor than trying to approach it as day trading (and needing to time the market). 
For focus investing, you just need a reasonable entry, not the best entry. After that, you can make adjustments in your portfolio as you go along, and won't take huge chunks of your day.
