You can dispute chargebacks. Customer then has to initiate a second chargeback. You have to respond. Then it goes to arbitration. Would cost 500 bucks to your processing company. Your processing company simply does not care about your money.

Credit card fraud is a problem for merchants, not for consumers.

VISA and Mastercard don't care about any of this.
Those are the guys who fuck you over within the guidelines of VISA and Mastercard. But there is a 1000 page guideline for each of them. Do you think your processing company cares about your 1k?

Just to give you a heads up.
Kraken required the ID selfie because a lot of german bank accounts were illegally created and filled with stolen money. 
I saw german and other european bank accounts listed on the special website for 500-3000€ or whatever it was. Idiots will use this method to launder their money into bitcoin.

They simply don't want chargebacks with their shady business model. They say some files are available only through premium. You pay it, file is gone.

The hassle is not worth the fear.
Some idiot in Italy once added a zero on his transcript. Did he get it? No.
I would put getting murdered on top.

I have proof that Btc-e either got hacked, lost coins because they are stupid or simply scams customers. 
And no, I'm not doxxing myself. 
edit: obvious downvote idiots. Theres's a police investigation you nerds.

I didn't know Sofortüberweisung can be reversed by the bank. It is very strange. But ze Sparkassen are owned by local godvernments in Germany so it's not a surprise they don't like Bitcoin.

Greece will probably switch to some sort of GDP repayment system for the next 30-40 years. 
But Greece isn't big enough to cause a hiccup. China is the most likely candidate with all their ghost cities.
