i have to think about it some more, and perhaps someone that knows more about cryptography than me can help. 
I know Euler's theorem has been used for RSA encryption before so it is not a completely random starting point. 
basically my idea would be based on some proof of communication (encrypted ping/hash/handshake) between all operating nodes. 
Of course this means that all operating noes must be visible and that non-visible ones are at a disadvantage, and the firewall of china may cause issues if communication out of it is faster than communication in - but i am sure the differences could be dynamically coded into any proof of node system. 
Haven't really thought it through too much, to be honest.

Perhaps i should have been clearer - bandwidth speed would be one (not necessarily hardware, i know) - and also disk read and write speed  - certainly as miners would be optimising these (have already).


essentially i don't - but i have read that there was a large concern with block sizes above 4MB - so, for instance, i assumed that BU's protocol would have meant increased complexity with regards security, and that Classic would have also had to deal with security issues if they continued down their increased block size development road map.
Again, i reiterate - i am not an expert on Bitcoin protocol - but i do understand that changes in the protocol at the base network layer have knock on effects. 
I also understand that the protocol from Core is getting more and more complex - which is why they want to roll out the last few features (Compact Blocks and SegWit) before moving development to the second network layer. 
Whether or not this road map is the correct one - i cannot say for sure - but it is a roadmap, and i have yet to be convinced that there is somebody out there with a better alternative.

I don't think its about complexity of code. It about complexity of the network layer.
But yes, from what i understand doubling transaction capacity for every block, increasing hardware requirements for the operative nodes on that layer, and decreasing (if however slightly) the security of that layer has the cumulative effect of adding complexity to the layer - and I am sure there are other complexities that I haven't mentioned. I am not an expert in the bitcoin protocol, but I do know a few things about network theory.

Indeed. There is no way I could explain it to my mother for example, or a number of her friends. I would even have doubts about my sister and my gf, and they are far from stupid.

The whole design is for microtransactions. Routing will be far more difficult for large transactions, as there won't be that type of liquidity in the system. 


I am talking about privacy as a factor of security, not hash rate (though with the recent discoveries of browser based mining, Monero is looking pretty secure)


I am talking about node decentralisation, not developer decentralisation. Ether has nearly four times the amount of full nodes compared to Bitcoin, as their incentives are far more widespread. 
I am a LN believer, you don't need to convince me. I am just being realistic about things in the cryptospace.

Bitcoin microtransactions? Bitcoin has a lot of good things about it, but it can't, and won't ever be all things to all people. It's why altcoins exist in the first place.

You do know that LN will be used for microtransactions? It won't be safe for large transactions. 
You are talking as if other altcoins aren't secure (Monero is arguably more secure), decentralised (ETH has more full nodes and doesn't have centralised mining), first moved advantage (doesn't really apply in a industry as agile as crypto/digital), not to mention that LN isn't even here yet.

Well of course, it's a case that probably hasn't been tested in any jurisdiction. However, if a good is always sold in Bitcoin. That is the market value. The person who is actually making the conversion to fiat, will be the seller of the good, as they convert Bitcoin to fiat to pay their supplier. 
The problem is that most goods for sale will advertise a fiat value alongside a Bitcoin value.

ETH is the bedrock for a substantial amount of companies in Blockchain tech, and stands as the pinnacle of  permissionless tech in the space.

You are correct. However, if goods are only being advertised and sold at Bitcoin price, there is no literal conversion back to fiat at any stage.

Yes, but your argument about first mover advantage then applies to the other cryptos that Bitcoin is trying to replicate. 
As I said, development moves so fast in crypto, and in a multitude of directions. 
Bitcoin cannot be all things to all people, and it would be foolish even trying. It should concentrate on what it does best, and develop from that base.

Yes, ok, but why do you think they have to be unencrypted? That was what I was saying. That they don't need to be. They could be easily hashed, as the node does not need them to relay/rebalance. It uses the deterministically generated keys to do this autonomously. 
Thank you for educating all of us, honestly. It is obvious you know your security (much better than I), but I don't think it's fair to say, and certainly less fair to create fear in the community surrounding where keys are stored on LN, or who has access to them at any given time, especially when the white paper does address (to more or less degrees) these concerns, and explains how it is dealt with.

The problem wasnt that it was a hard fork, it was that it would have been a contentious hard fork. If they had executed a plan as you describe, there is no way of knowing if the market would have accepted it and that could have potentially been a worse problem. 
It was obvious that people felt, for whatever reason, that SW as a soft fork was the way to go. The market wasn't sure. It was actually the market that was co-opted into accepting SW2X, and that is where the blame should lay, in my opinion. 
If it hadn't of been accepted/signed, SW wouldn't have gone through, and alternative plans would have been put in place. Whether you should blame the market for being duped, or the dupers for the sham that was pulled, I am not sure anymore.

@_date: 2017-12-22 20:49:34


This may well be the case - as i am no expert. 


Yes, i agree with this. 


Yes - this is done when a channel is opened. I imagine a series of DKs (deterministically generated keys) are generated against the Master Key - these are then stored somewhere. The Master Key can then be re-encrypted (or the encrypted version deleted). 


The node has access to the DKs. Any other node also has access to them (for replay and rebalance). No node except my own has access to my encrypted Master Key - and only i know the password that this is encrypted against. 
If this is a completely failed understanding, then i am truly sorry. 
but yes - the attack vector is when i decrypt my Master Key when opening a channel to another user. As i have to be online - this is an obvious target for malicious actors.

you really need to read the whitepaper. 
"To update the balance, both parties create a new spend from the 2-of-2 multisignature address, for example 0.07 to Alice and 0.03 to Bob. Without proper design, though, there is the timestamping problem of not knowing which spend is correct: the new spend or the original refund.
The restriction on timestamping and dates, however, is not as complex as full ordering of all transactions as in the bitcoin blockchain. In the case of micropayment channels, only two states are required: the current correct balance, and any old deprecated balances. There would only be a single correct current balance, and possibly many old balances which are deprecated.
Therefore, it is possible in bitcoin to devise a bitcoin script whereby all old transactions are invalidated, and only the new transaction is valid. Invalidation is enforced by a bitcoin output script and dependent trans- actions which force the other party to give all their funds to the channel counterparty. By taking all funds as a penalty to give to the other, all old transactions are thereby invalidated.
This invalidation process can exist through a process of channel consensus where if both parties agree on current ledger states (and building new states), then the real balance gets updated. The balance is reflected on the blockchain only when a single party disagrees. Conceptually, this system is not an independent overlay network; it is more a deferral of state on the current system, as the enforcement is still occurring on the blockchain itself (albeit deferred to future dates and transactions)."

No it doesn't. A channel is a set in stone commitment between two users, of a certain value. The amount cannot be varied on an ongoing basis. That does not make sense. Relaying payments and rebalancing is done in the LN, not on chain.

@_date: 2017-12-07 23:28:53
Look, I don't know if you are taking the piss or what. 
In theory, with LN you could open one channel (one transaction) and in that channel transact numerous times with peers (let's just say 10 for arguments sake). 
That would be cheaper (I would hazard a guess) than 11 separate on chain transactions. 
Do you not think?

I am no technical expert, but the keys are generated deterministically, from one master key. They can be checked and confirmed by the LN node, but they cannot be reverse engineered. Of course, the fact that the LN node knows its own Private Master Key, is an attack vector.

literally the next paragraph in the paper talks of how this is mitigated. Yes there is a hot wallet - and this is a risk - as are all hot wallets. However, the paper addresses the risk, and even offers a solution - with a two tier system. 
"A Funding Transaction may have multiple outputs with multiple Commitment Transactions, with the Funding Transaction key and some Commitment Transactions keys stored offline. It is possible to create an equivalent of a “Checking Account” and “Savings Account” by moving funds between outputs from a Funding Transaction, with the “Savings Account” stored offline and requiring additional signatures from security services."

Any digital currency that charges fees to transact will never replace cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:34:43
no you are not correct. from page 5 of the whitepaper
"Instead, both parties can commit to signing a transaction and not broadcasting this transaction. So if Alice and Bob commit funds into a 2- of-2 multisignature address (where it requires consent from both parties to create spends), they can agree on the current balance state. Alice and Bob can agree to create a refund from that 2-of-2 transaction to themselves, 0.05 BTC to each. This refund is not broadcast on the blockchain. Either party may do so, but they may elect to instead hold onto that transaction, knowing that they are able to redeem funds whenever they feel comfortable doing so. By deferring broadcast of this transaction, they may elect to change this balance at a future date."
You see - so they sign one transaction - to which they are committed. All other rebalancing and relaying is done within the LN, on the back of this signed commitment. The balance of the channel is then forward as the refund amounts when the channel is broadcast to main chain. They swap signed relays and rebalances - but they are signed with deterministically generated keys from the master key. 
edit: added last sentence.

It's far from ideal, but people attempting to rationalise it with utter tripe makes it even worse. 
It's obvious a problem exists, and as yet no solution is on the table, ready for use. 
Having said that, the more people that leave Bitcoin, the lower the mempool will get, so it will self regulate. However there are enough currencies that can absorb the transaction volume that leaves, and to be honest they may never come back, LN or no LN, due to the shitshow that has gone on.

No it's not. As I have said before, a deterministically generated key is used to sign/relay/replay. As the white paper states, you can safely keep your Master Private Key locked away.

ETH has a substantial advantage/differentiation at the moment as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:07:05
Decetralisation is a function of the amount of nodes, and their geographical distribution. ETH has three times as many nodes. 
The rollback was done with majority consensus. Those that didn't agree, forked. This does not matter an iota to the term decentralisation and it's representation in a network.

As far as i am aware and understand - but i am no expert on cryptography - the Master Key is used to generate deterministic 'spend' keys. Whether a set of these is created at the opening of a channel and then subsequently verified as and when needed - i don't know. I am not the technical expert. I am just saying that the whitepaper does address these issues. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:26:57
No, I was talking about the htlc website. Though just realised that if I create a payment request, that can be used by another wallet (and the route through Starblocks if that route is available). Am I correct?

Seriously, get some sense into yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:08:29
Ah seriously. Stop.
I have outlined my understanding of it, and have given you quotes from the actual paper. 
The next section actually goes on to describe how the final balance of the channel as given by the LN is the one commited to the chain. The whole concept revolves around this. 
If you don't see it, then don't see it, but don't troll me. 
The answer to the question is literally the next section of the paper, but i am not going to go and copy and paste that whole section. 
In short, the private keys are not broadcast or shared to all nodes. It's a ludicrous accusation, and one borne from misunderstanding of the protocol.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:26:52

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:14:24
That centralised layer you talk about will always be there, regardless. It's a natural tendency of emergent networks, in nature, practice and in theory - with a few exceptions, of course. 
LN is actually the only tech out there which affords a gradual movement away from, and an overall reduction in the interfacing with, these centralisd layers.
If the network emerges as hoped (and don't forget there will be choice with respect to routing), you may find that the LN creates a truly decentralised P2P network. One that may even reward remaining p2p if they code in incentives (which there has been talk of). 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:28:42

The real question is when is the ICO.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:48:23
To be honest, I would imagine the public statements are the demos of LN that are starting to appear, as well as the open source github of the logged issues with the pre release software. 
If you sell BTC now and use BCH (if everyone does), BTC won't have any problems , so in theory, the network has self regulated. 
Of course it should never ever have come to this, but it has, I am afraid. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:44:16

My advice is stay in school. Use the time to research and learn about what you love (this may be learning how to trade, or learning more about crypto in general) while doing what the Uni wants you to do for the piece of paper.
After the Masters, maybe look at doing a paid PhD in something you love, or finding a job/project/idea that you love. 
This advice come from someone who has a BSc, MSc, and PhD, and is now going back to do a paid research MSc in something I love....
And yes, crypto has helped all of the above. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:48:13
Yes, ok, you can look at it like that, but with Cash there is also a physiological fee; handing cash over to another person. If you had to go and meet them at a designated spot, this would be even greater. 
The argument still stands though, as you and I could pass $10 worth of IOTA between us, without it losing any value due to transaction fees. This is not that same for most other cryptos. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:25:04
If this is the case, the fight is going to get pretty damn messy I would think. Heavy government regulation incoming I would imagine. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:16:04
Yes, a dip is a reduction in price from a previous price level, that the market feels is a slight correction. The market classifies this correction as inevitable/natural, as they feel price will revert back to original position within a short term time period. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:25:07
Right, but you do realise that pretty much rules out 99% of cryptos. As far as I know, it's IOTA's tangle you would want to bet on, but that's centralised.

There is a happy medium, and I think the problem is that Core have been 'attacked' and 'vilified' so much (and they have, some of the accusation, threats, and behaviour has been dispicable), they have resorted back into a defensive shell, where they resent giving out any information at all, lest they be hated any more. It is really sad. 
If everyone stood back for a moment and judged their code and nothing more, they would see that Core, as a team, have done as much, if not more, for Bitcoin that anybody else in the space.

I don't think there is a single 'judge', a single set of characteristics to judge against, nor a single specific answer to the question. 
The spectrum of what is 'best' is broad. It's like asking what the best country in the world is, the best house, or the best food.

yeah, Electrum is good that way, but i am setting a dynamic fee, which is 110% of the suggested fee. Would i not run into the same problems as with Ledger if the average fee is extraordinarily high at the time i am trying to make the transaction?
@_date: 2017-02-02 20:36:34
to be honest, this sounds a tad like conspiracy theory to me. I didn't think i would see this here to be honest. I am quite surprised. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 20:35:58
yes, this may be true, of course - but i doubt it. 
If SW support was so strong, it would be close to activating by now - at least getting close to 75%. 
The fact remains that it will not activate as alternative implementations control more than 5% of the network. People who support SW (of which i am one) should get real, and realise that it will be a long wait for SW activation. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 13:42:35
I put through a transaction at 120% dynamic fees, and i have been waiting for nearly 24 hours. I think there is just a quite a lot of traffic at the moment. Obviously there is nothing that can be done by users - its up to developers, miners, and node operators to sort it out. At the moment, their indecision and inaction is causing an issue - in my personal opinion.

There are a couple of other pools that have said they will not signal segwit, as far as i know. I haven't been keeping completely up to date with it. I just know that the rate of signalling for SW seems to be slowing, while BU seems to keep increasing. Of course, this may change in the next 10 months (a long time in bitcoin land), but i am not so sure.

On a completely irrelevant side note, the BBC (state television and radio broadcaster) in the UK have a weekly NFL programme. 
The two US pundits (ex players, above average intelligence) keep complaining that they have to learn so many new words. As an example they didn't know the plural of stadium was stadia (though to be fair, that got me as well). 
Quite amusing. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 12:55:55
Its doable, but from my experience, you have to change the bet odds to 1.8, as apposed to 2, and also change the losing bet multiplier ti 120%. The way the game works is similar to a Roulette table. The 0 on the table is represented by a range of numbers that are neither hi or lo, and eventually this will mean you lose, if you don't change the betting odds and the bet multiplier.

@_date: 2017-02-02 13:52:47
there may be things that people do not agree with discussed there, and indeed some of it seems a bit over the top, but i have been quite surprised at the rate of adoption of BU - especially when SW is on the table as an alternative/pre fork option. 
I didn't think BU would get so much support. If i was betting on which would be adopted first, my hunch at this stage is actually on BU. 
edit: grammar
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:34:02
yeah, i am not so sure. i think a lot of people underestimate how much support BU actually has. It also has the support of quite a lot of influential voices, respected voices, and some very educated ones as well. I know the default setting here is to hide heads in the sand in denial, but BU seems to be well on the way to full adoption - whether it is liked here or not. 
My opinion stands that SW should be adopted first - but it doesn't look like that is going to happen, so people should prepare for a BU fork in the near future. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 21:17:39
I am not saying SW is bad, I am saying that it won't reach 95% consensus before the expiration date. It probably won't even reach 75% consensus. People need to get real.

but how can one know if its the right moment, or the wrong moment to send bitcoin? It seems quite arbitrary, no? 
It would be good to get an approval screen on the ledger chrome app that calculates the estimated fee, and then warns/asks for approval from the user before they apply the transaction. 
At this stage of proceedings, this would be good to have on every wallet application.

Technically he used the incorrect term, yes. 
It is a flattening of the supply curve, as it approaches an aggregate fixed amount. The general gist was correct. 
If you factor in the slowly increasing demand curve (which is not fixed), it equates to a rise in price.

You are correct, except in theory BTC value in USD will rise to compensate, as USD/fiat is worth less in relative terms.

as far as i know you can put them in a personal wallet [electrum]( for example - and then give them the 12-word seed address that you are given when creating your wallet. It is a string of twelve words that allow you to recover your wallet if you lose your computer. 
there may be better ways - [Satori]( i think do a tangible bitcoin as well, so you could go down that route.

You are making the conclusion that people that used to buy legal highs, haven't since tried to find a secondary avenue to get said highs or alternatives. What was once available online ot at a local legal highs shop is not any longer. Bitcoin is undoubtedly used for this kind of trade, so a small increase in demand from these new buyers could certainly cause a mini price increase.
The correlation between the date of legislation change and the price curves is pretty clear, though of course this does not immediately imply causation, admittedly. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 11:51:17
do they actually have any plans for this. That is the main concern for me as well - as transactions do seem to take an absolute age to confirm these days, which is worrying. The halving might indeed cause many miners to shut up shop (if price does not go up toward a double of todays) which will lead to even slower transaction times. 
Has there been any official discussion of how they are going to solve this problem, as i doubt slow transaction speeds were ever a designed, and embedded feature!
@_date: 2016-06-28 12:44:32

pretty much this! nobody knows anything :) its completely new, one second at a time. Fancy that - life teaching us a lesson once again. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 21:06:35
Is this true? I know its probably simplified, but are the figures correct? 
If it is, it does sound like very basic economics that as long as demand stays about the same (given some fluctuations, of course) that the price will start a steady and sustained increase. The only issue is probably what will happen to transaction speed if miners start to drop away. The system could really slow down - which may cause more problems, that we can even imagine. 
All i do know, is that i am pretty sure there is a designed and coded reason why my wallet can represent my balance in BTC, mBTC and bits (well i am hoping its because it will be easier to mentally calculate their value in the medium term future!)
@_date: 2016-06-23 10:42:19
though i actually do find this comment quite funny, as undeniably there is an iota of truth in it, i think you will find that bitcoin is becoming the back end monetary transaction medium for a number of peer-to-peer applications.

this makes sense to me. The underlying growth curve is there for all to see. The underlying technology is scheduled to improve, and the halving is still coming. There are still far more reasons to be positive than negative, and i have already lost a bit in this little blippedy blip time.

@_date: 2016-06-22 11:43:12
I have a feeling things are only getting warmed up as well. 
Once the halving happens - and lets say the price starts going up relatively fast, and sustained - you don't think there is good copy for journalists there? This will, of course lead to a greater expansion of said bubble. 
Of course, if the halving has no effect (or a detrimental effect due to increased transaction times as miners decide it time to call quits), we will see a drop and a return to a 'mean', coupled with a slow, but sustained increase in price due to the basic supply and demand issues that will be faced by the bitcoin infrastructure. Don't be fooled into thinking that people won't want bitcoin. They will want bitcoin. Even the fact that more and more companies are appearing that use bitcoin as their backend monetary transfer system tends to this impression.  
tl;dr there will either be a fast, massive increase leading to a bursting bubble - or a return to slow, gradual, but sustained price increase.
Either way you look at it, there will be profits made. 
The only thing that could mess it up is a hacking of the infrastructure. That would obviously be very bad indeed.

Have you heard of [this company]( called BitSewa. I only found out about them recently. My mother is trying to educate her friends and family about Bitcoin at the moment so they can use it for remittance from Ireland/UK. BitSewa are a bitcoin exchange based in Nepal. They may have the backend infrastructure to help you set up something which is purely remittance based. Have you had any progress, or talked to anybody? Would love to be kept in the loop about this, and may also have some time to help you from this side UK/Ireland.

No, i am not implying that SegWit will affect price movements, i am inferring that once the medium term roadmap of Bitcoin is decided (whether SegWit, BU, or HF) the ecosystem will again begin to grow healthily and steadily - and this will be reflected in an upward trajectory of price.

I signed up to circle, and they are stating that there is no fee when lodging to a UK or US Debit Card, but it says little about the conversion rate they use for calculating your balances - which makes me think that is where they are making their profit this way - which is probably quite a lot as well, given their non-committal attitude to divulging exchange rates.

This is pretty much how i see it as well. Its basic economics - and i am pretty sure that everyone on this forum knows it. A lot of the wider public know it as well - hence the recent bubble. The bitfinix spooked a load of people, given history of exchanges going tits up, as did the ethereum hacking crap. Other than that, i am pretty certain price will keep on rising. 
We would be foolish to think that basic demand and supply laws do not apply to bitcoin.
Perhaps though, i am in the denial stage. I doubt it though. ;-)

@_date: 2017-08-14 00:59:45
Ok, so what if the cryptography gets broken and someone manages to corrupt enough copies of the chain, the block order, the signatures, the timestamps, etc so it is no longer obvious which copy of the chain is untampered with? 
If only 20% of the nodes, for arguments sake, can agree on a state of the blockchain at time T, how will anybody know if that chain is actually the true chain, or just part of a complex plot, or collusion, as part of the attack vector. 
I understand the likelihood is slim to none, but I am just wondering if this doomsday scenario is accounted for in anyway, other than trusting the combined affordances of encryption and decentralisation. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:39:29
Yes. As with most things in life, the more you pay, the better quality you get. 
For me, as I dont really access the cold storage coins that much, the HW1 was fine. If you are accessing them frequently, then it may be worth spending more. 
Having said that, if the HW1 were to break, I could just use the master seed to recreate the wallet on another device. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:17:01
Because exchanges, wallets, and all bitcoin services will all have to deal with a chain split, and be completely ready for a chain split. 
You don't think there is a chance of users transacting on the wrong chain, services developing transaction issues regarding incorrect chains, errors in code causing wallets to not sync properly? They are just a few problems that may arise. 
The ethereum fork showed some if these happening, on an ecosystem far, far smaller than Bitcoin. Bitcoin also has a huge amount of users that are not completely educated about the network. Even the damage it could cause to their trust in Bitcoin is something to think about. 
Yes, a hardfork can happen smoothly, but you are naive to think it will pass through without causing a fair amount of disruption to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

@_date: 2017-01-02 11:47:09
The technical mechanics do not, you are correct - but the overall mechanism does. 
One of the main big block arguments is that the market wants lmore on chain capacity. Why would you then disrupt the market by pursuing a hard fork? 
By all means, you have every right to, but you are foolish or naive to think that it will not cause damage (admittedly probably fixable in the medium term) to the ecosystem. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 11:20:26

That doesn't tell us anything we don't know before. 
I do wish someone would link to an informed article about the bitcoin halvening - even if it is just speculation. 
My guess is that $600 is the mean price at the moment (this is the current real value of bitcoin, taking into account the expected effect of the halvening). 
The actual halvening will cause volatility in the market (as has been happening the last week or so), that will continue up until the end of July, start of August. (day traders will be making good money here as 10-20% fluctuations will be the norm for 24-48 hour periods)
After that, there will be a return to the slow but sustained price increase. 
Will be well into 2017 until we see $1000+ a btc. But that is just my two sense. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 08:58:52
As far as I know that master seed allows you to recreate the wallet on another device if the original device gets damaged/lost.
The device contains the private key for signing bitcoin transactions, and is protected by your your own four sogot pin, and also by the pass key card that comes with the device. 
Both are attack vectors, but in reality, if someone were to get hold of the master seed, they could easily create a new wallet on a new device. Most people would keep the master seed hidden away/in a safety deposit box, etc.

That's because in reality most people are interested in bitcoin because they want it to make themselves rich. The political, social, technological, and economic benefits for society are merely a secondary, used for the most part as markering material. 
Sad, but its true. 
At least the recent rocket in price and incoming new users has quietened down the arguing about blocksize, and if all works well, the increased transaction volume is going to cause the system to have to sort outs its protocol issues...

Looking at Bitstamp, i reckon we are going to be bubbling in the $1100s for a while. There is also serious resistance building at $1200 on the order books, which makes me think there is a load of profit takers at that price and above. 
I would keep an eye on the transaction volume levels - if that starts dropping, then the demand is not going to there to support the transient state, and we will start retracing down - who knows to where. 
If we can hover in the $1100s for a day, i think that would be a very good sign.

it doesn't have to just be adopted by nodes. This is ridiculous, it has to be adopted by wallets, exchanges and all bitcoin services. How can you not see this?


yes, there is a chance. in fact it happened with the Ethereum hardfork. At first, the two chains will contain the same data - but as transactions happen, the chains will diverge - which raises the potential for problems within the ecosystem. 


Ethereum did split in two. Did you not realise this? You have two Ethereum coins now being traded, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. 
I am not saying that a hardfork cannot happen without causing any issues - of course it can, but the fact that the hardfork is contentious means that there is much much greater chance of the ecosystem suffering because of it.

I dont think is necessarily true to be honest. I can think of one major standout case when miners decide block size.
Eg. There are three miners. They decide to cap blocks at 1MB, increasing mempool. Transaction fees rise as a result. After mempool is high, the three miners increase block size to 2MB, clearing mempool and taking with it the inflated fees. 
Please explain how this scenario is possible with a capped block size?

Hang on. Please divulge some more information for us. 
Are you helping the underprivileged use Bitcoin in your business, and these people are complaining about the fees?   Or is your business linked to some form of trading platform?
The desire to lower fees is quite different from these two perspectives if you are attempting to justify a block size increase on moral grounds. 
While i agree, transaction fees should be relatively low enough for the underprivileged to be able to benefit from bitcoin, but to be honest I couldn't care less about traders and/or gamblers wanting lower transaction fees.

The Bitcoin Podcast is great, so well done. But you guys need to spend some bits on your sound/mixing setup. It is getting better, but some of the older podcasts were woeful in terms of balanced levels between the guests. Might be worth getting a compressor in the signal chain as well. Anybody doing radio should really read up on the benefits of having a compressor in their audio signal chain - even if its just a digital one on the master bus...

I was under the impression that the block reward was for ledging transactions, but I suppose the way it is defined means it is for solving the block. The fees become the incentive for pledging transactions. 
Either way empty blocks being mined, and rewarded is something that should be stopped with a BIP, surely?

As far as i know, but i can ask her as i am home for xmas - the cost involved in the transfer, the exchange rates, and the fact that most of her extended family do not have bank accounts. This means that until recently Western Union was the only method. 
It has changed recently, as her bank Allied Irish Bank now charges a flat rate of €15 - but again the exchange rates are not that great, and her extended family do not all have bank accounts. So, she send it to a friend that has one, and then the intended recipient collects the Rupees from her friend.

I understand what wasted energy means. 
What you failing to consider is that mining as an industry utilising surplus electricity may be incentive enough to stop the creation of some other footloose industry that would be more "worthwhile".

The whole $1,000,000 per bitcoin is a bit misleading. If Bitcoin were to get that high, people wouldn't cash out, they would just keep their Bitcoin and be happy with that.

i just tried blockchain.info for the UK. seemed pretty straightforward for a debit card purchase (plus 3% fee).

You know, I do get what you are saying, but traditional banking services come in handy sometimes. For instance, I lost my wallet in the airport once. Arrived at destination with nothing. Phoned my bank and they set up for money to come out of an ATM for me with a pin code. Am not sure how that would work with bitcoin if I lost my phone with my wallet on it for instance. Also, just the other day, my bank sent me a refund on overcharged loan repayments - from like 15 years ago. Thought that was quite good of them. I would have known no different. Again, am not sure that would happen it bitcoin world - unless the services around bitcoin develop, of course.

Or, for example, you could use the surplus electricity to solve specific computer intensive problems such as protein folding, genetic decoding, or aid in projects such as SETI. 
Of course, whether or not these examples are more worthwhile are somewhat subjective, but you get the basic idea.
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:42:33

Surely the numbers dont need to be so large. The same gaming could happen at 2 and 4 MB, or indeed at 1 and 2 MB block sizes.

@_date: 2016-12-29 09:37:08
To be fair though, a lot of this growth is from people buying Bitcoin as a store of value. They will buy Bitcoin and make one, two, or at most three transactions. If all these new users were transacting on a daily, hourly, or minute by minute basis, I am pretty sure the mempool would raise substantially.

They are by far the easiest way to buy instant bitcoin in the UK with debit card at the moment (since circle). 3% fee which isn't cheap, but probably about the same as Circle was.

There is no proof it is not a spam attack, and their is no proof it is a spam attack. You shouldn't get downvoted for realising that. It could just as easily be a wallet glitch/malfunction, but with the size of the transaction, that is a questionable theory.

@_date: 2018-06-10 08:24:35


excuse me? completely misplaced? Have some respect.
I am not fear mongering, i am merely stating some misgivings i have about a completely fixed supply. It is wholly worthy of a debate, especially given that other notable cryptos have had the debate already, and included a tailed emission rate in their protocol. 
It is a valid concern, that people just hand wave away. Much like you are now - attacking what you think i represent, rather than what i am actually discussing. 


intellectually honest? what are you on about? 'sound money' (do you mean Nash's Ideal Money?) doesn't (as as far as i know) infer that you have a fixed supply. 
Please point to the place that Nash states that it should have fixed supply if he does. 
He states that the global reserve currency should be stable. 
You can also infer from his writings that there should not be a disincentive to spend within the economy. This would lead to numerous problems. Having a fixed supply would cause this indirectly, and directly. 
Inflation is artificially managed by states - as an disincentive to hoarding; hoarding leads directly to both economic and social issues (the main ones being unemployment and lack of investment). 
Your answer to this problem is to hope that sellers periodically reduce prices (or wages, i assume) to counter this problem. 
You really think that this will be possible to enforce? 
At least with centralised economic planning, one entity can make decisions to ensure that inflation rate stays at a healthy 1-2%. 
In your economy, who is going to ensure that prices and wages decrease? Answer that please.

@_date: 2017-11-12 04:09:32
It doesn't always, though sometimes will, depending on the makeup of the transaction. In fact there may well be numerous cases where a lowering value of transaction costs far more than a much higher value transaction. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:32:05
A week to sort out the transaction backlog and the fees? Seriously? It shouldn't have to take a week when the majority of bitcoin transactions have moved to BCH already.

I don't know. At the moment remittance is a bit more expensive through traditional means. 
Ever seen the lines at Western Union in developing countries? And that's not cheap at all. 
Of course that is not to say that it should not be cheaper to transact. We all know it should, but in fairness, SW is making it cheaper.

Ah come on, get real. BCH isn't going anywhere, otherwise it would have folded already. 
As long as people value it, people can make money from it. As long as people can make money from it, it will be mined. As long as there are miners mining it, it will be used. It isn't going anywhere.

People are in denial if they think the rise on BCH is a pump. It's gaining traction, and for valid reasons. The sooner people realise this, the better - especially if BTC and BCH are supposed to have similar utilities.

Not very well. 
Your first reply to the question posed was more apt. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:22:33
That's great, but obviously not the case for a fair section of the world. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:44:40
What are you on about? no it is not. I sent a significant amount (more than the examples below) of BTC from a legacy address to a SW address today. It cost me $8 USD. 
To send £4000 GBP to a developing nation (Nepal for instance, other examples such as Peru, Bolivia, and Suriname) costs me £60 GBP. Papua New Guinea costs £85 GBP. 
You can check for yourself [here]( 
Admittedly there are differences in fees for Western Union for different countries, but even to send GBP to Ireland costs me about $12 USD (£9.90 GBP) through Western Union. 
edit: ok i see you said a few hundred dollars. Remittance is usually more than that in dollar terms, and anyway is still more expensive than BTC at the moment.

thats interesting. When did you get it? I am just wondering how the phishers managed to get my everyday used email (which i rarely use to sign up for accounts with), and also know that i had accounts on local bitcoins and blockchain (signed up with other other email addresses). Seems strange to me. Might be that a bitcoin company has leaked email addresses somewhere - as someone suggests as being btce

yes, this is quite a well trodden quote, but you it says nothing about a company he wishes to control, and in my view is talking about the utilities that PayPal provides, rather than the ownership or organisation model.

It's funny you should mention this. I found a fairly serious bug with one of the major wallets just the other day. Sent it to the company and they are investigating. They seemed to be very surprised that a bug of this nature was found. 
@_date: 2016-09-08 16:00:46
Lol. 
Yeah, would be hard to disprove that they weren't Roomies in the first place - as there must have been a password on the online wallet and he knew that and was able to send the bitcoin somewhere. 
@_date: 2016-09-20 17:01:30
I was wondering about this as well, but in respect to the ledger nano - and buying them from a 3rd party. In theory they could just create an indentical unit, packaging, and software, but with malicious purposes...

That's a pretty interesting website.
We should have seen this coming. It was only a few days ago that Russia 'legalised' bitcoin, and there is a LOT of money in Russia.
If you factor in the countries that deal with Russia, and the fact they would want a monetary exchange system that ia quicker/cheaper/safer than FIAT, the price rise is actually a no brainer.

Will think about the other options as well.
@_date: 2016-09-08 16:04:33
No, you obviously can't, but the wallet must have had a password, and the roommate obviously knew it. If he knew the password, he could easily say, they were my bitcoins...

@_date: 2016-09-25 19:07:18
To be fair, the research has been done, and discussed.
A 2-4MB size is probably doable, and wouldn't alter things drastically.
I think its more setting the precedent for block size increase that I would be weary about, as larger blocks definitely favours those that can afford and maintain the latest specifications for full node systems. 
Most that want big blocks "NOW" don't actually care for precedents, and concerns for network centralisation that much, as far as I can tell. 
@_date: 2016-09-08 16:03:07
Solid advice. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:16:55
Grin will definitely be its own token.
It is an independent implementation of the MimbleWimble protocol. 
Blockstream's Andrew Polestra did a lot of the gorundwork for MimbleWimble, and is interested on it being a sidechain for BTC. 
Monero are interested on it being a sidechain on Monero. 
The Grin project is a ground up implementation of MimbleWimble.

They don't care about the rate of growth of the blockchain. That much became obvious a long time ago. They say to just buy a bigger hard drive - as the increase in cost is almost negligible.

You seem to know about this stuff, so can I ask one last question? 
I have uploaded the pgp encrypted file with my seed and other information to a cloud server. the private keys to decrypt this info is on my personal computer - gpg keychain tools osx
Should I backup these keys as well?
Still getting my head around encryption, as you can tell! 
@_date: 2016-09-08 22:53:34
Yes, of course, but if he can prove he knew the password, then legally it is difficult to disprove that he owns portions of it.

that's debatable.

what are you on about? 
A user going onto an interface (of their own free will) and facing the choice of buying two tokens, one named BCH and one named BTC, but not understanding which is which and this buying the incorrect one is in no way comparable to being raped, or tempting thieves.

Hagan Homes is a Northern Irish company (still viewed by some as Ireland, but legally part of the UK). 
They are not the largest home builder in the South. 
However this is a very interesting stance, and will impact both North and South. If it's accepted in the North and brings in foreign investment it will be applauded. It is accepted in the South and brings in foreign investment it will be raise alarms (as the South is going through a housing crisis, with a paucity of affordable housing for the younger generation available).

Was wondering why this took so long to get posted. Ireland native here (personally I don't distinguish between North and South, others do). 
This is an interesting stance, and will be watched closely by the UK (Northern Ireland is the jurisdiction of the UK) and South (who are in the midst of a housing crisis). 
If houses in the south are sold to foreign investors looking to safe haven their Bitcoin, there will be serious uproar. If houses in the North are sold to foreign investors, this would pique interest. If either houses are bought by local/native investors, this legitimises BTC and raises tax and legislation concerns immediately. 
Interesting space to watch, as it has implications for either Europe, or the UK.

It's the choice of words to describe the motive and the context. Personally, I don't like the word 'attack', but if the majority of the network (I haven't a clue which is the correct measure for this) decide the miners are changing the consensus rules to suit themselves, as apposed to the network in totality, then it may be called an 'attack'.


Is this a rhetorical question? They are allowed to run whatever they like on their hardware. Did you think they weren't? 


As far as I am aware, distributed consensus is reached when a decision is made, and agreed upon, by +50% of the network. 


Because bitcoin, through its protocol design, leverages profit making motives to activate a set of game theory enactions. These enactions are carefully balanced and lead to an incentive driven equilibrium to be reached in most cases - apart from when there are contentious issues. We have found that in these instances, a fork becomes the optimum outcome. Sadly, in my opinion. 


Yes, of course they are. Did you think otherwise? Perhaps this was another rhetorical question?


What? Whoever talked of unamity? Of course there will be greedy agents. It's money after all.

@_date: 2017-10-08 02:30:35
Seriously, this is just plain lies. 
There is nobody stealing your bitcoin.
There is going to be a HF, meaning that you will receive b2x tokens to the same amount of BTC that you own. 
What happens to the chains after the fork is totally down to the market, and in my opinion, is the way it should be. If no miners are willing to secure the legacy chain, then the legacy chain is not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:54:42
It's not a random number, it was the number that was arrived at, with respect to a very definite  and defined inflation schedule, with respect to block height.

Again, another true statement that people seem to prefer not to believe. I am not sure why this is the case.

@_date: 2018-07-24 19:11:03
As far as I was aware that is a valid attack vector. 
As masternodes ultimately have leveraged access to information, if they collude their leverage is increased, and thus potentially they have the ability to gain access to 'private' information. 
Is this not correct?

This is not true, and was never true. If you have a source for this claim, then please do let me know. This paper here, which came from an external audit of DarkSend (the precursor to PrivateSend) details the weaknesses [Paper here]( There is also a response from Dash, [here]( The most up to date information that i coudl find is found [here]( and it still shows an attack vector. Indeed, the more nodes you have control of, the higher the chances you have of obtaining information. 


there are always economic implications to any gamet theory attack on a monetary system. That doesn't mean that the attack vector is not valid. it just costs more.

Well let's say there are 3 users and each user splits their PS into 100 pieces as per the protocol. there are 100 MNs that each receive one part of the first send/mux (as you described it). 
If the MNs collude, they can share information about the source of each of their bits of information, thereby building up a model of who owns what segment. 
Of course, the odds of this happening are extremely small, but it still shows that it's an attack vector, as MNs do have leveraged information even for just that initial distribution of PS segments. 
If the MNs collude at that point, they can begin to understand the network, and its users in a way that is more detailed then any one MN or user can in isolation, hence the term trusted privacy. 
You are trusting there is not collusion by the MNs.

You aren't even realising that the statement came from me saying that America bastardised dance music into the genre that is EDM - which is still essentially true, with references in the same article further on that you link to. 






The term EDM isn't even used in Europe, and the artists that are listed  in the section of the wikipedia article that you quoted would never in a million years be seen as EDM artists in their homelands. The Prodigy - electroclash, Chemical Brothers - Big Beat, Fatboy Slim - Big Beat, Underworld - House/Trance. Madonne (!?) - Pop. Tiesto - Trance, etc etc. 
The whole term 'EDM' is a commercial fabrication. You may have been there, and lived through it, but obviously you did not recognise that the commercial capitalist hype machine is what gave you your genre - not the artists, or even their artistic ethos.

well done! 
i wish i had the courage to trade properly. I just really invest in projects/coins i believe in - diversifying out my portfolio. 
I know there is a lot more money to be made day trading - especially in the current climate, but just doing due diligence and looking at current values/potential values has done alright for me so far.

To be fair, a Punto is a shit car. 
My first car was a Fiat Tipo. 1.6 petrol 88 reg. Had a fully digital dash. I miss it sometimes. 
I am in a similar boat to you. My portfolio has gone up immensely over the last while (as has most people's I would imagine). I am going on a three month trip to South America soon. I have the money for it anyway, but am thinking of cashing out some of the profits I currently hold to get a free extended holiday. Will be sad to lose the coins, but have pretty much made the decision at this stage, and it's only a small portion of my portfolio anyway...
What's the purpose of having money if you don't enjoy it?

i am sure that everyone agrees that a 200,000 transaction backlog, coupled with glitching fee estimations on some of the most trusted and popular wallets is not how anybody imagined Bitcoin would be in the year 2017. 
Bitcoin has to grow up, have some conviction, make a choice on the scaling debate, and then implement it.

its not really elitist. 
EDM represents, as i have said elsewhere in this post, the American bastardisation of electronic music - which is actually really sad, as the US pretty much invented dance music with New York disco, Chicago house and Detroit techno. 
As a nation, the US spurned those three - foregoing dance music entirely - while the rest of the world vibed off US artists and those they inspired - only to pick up dance music again with the horrible mashup of pop-trance and bro-step. It is laughable really.

You can't see the wood for the trees.
The transaction fees are a symptom of scaling solutions either not being ready or not being implemented. They are not a symptom of the desire to ensure that node costs are kept down so that a federated server system does not ever emerge (which incidentally we are already very close to happening already). 
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:45:24
I hear you, but in my opinion - and this can get downvoted as much as people please. Bitcoin shouldn't be in a situation where all the veryfying nodes are run by developed countries. It would be a digitally dependent two tier system - which just reeks of elitism - and that is NOT what Bitcoin was ever about. 
However, given technological development, i know this will change in the short to medium term future. Yet, it is certainly not the case now.

Fair enough. I was just offering context.  
What I am trying to say is that not all currencies compete with each other, and indeed there is rarely perfect competition between currencies. 
There are a number of cases where competition is restricted (trade not possible due to regulations or illiquidity) or where currencies act as complementary currencies (English and Northern Irish pounds for arguments sake). 
At the moment ETH and BTC can act as substitutes, in value transfer for example, but they also act to complement each other in other ways. 
BTC as an on ramp to ETH in some countries (quite a few). 
In other ways they cannot compete at all, like ETH as a platform for sophisticated Dapps.

@_date: 2017-07-06 07:35:10


As i have explained above in response to another poster - no they are not. 
In the real world - and in crypto, you have situations in which competition is not perfect, situations where regulation enforce a non-competitive environment, situations where currencies are tied or pegged to each other and, in a number of cases, situations where currencies are complementary to each other (English pounds and Northern Irish pounds).

Blockstream does not have a conflict of interests - as far as anybody can tell. They were always a capitalist enterprise. The developers involved with Blockstream do, however. The crux of the matter is whether you think Axa (supposed funders of Blockstream) are playing the cypherpunks, or the cypherpunks are playing Axa. 
Personally, i believe the second scenario, as i cannot see how the cypherpunks benefit from being controlled by Axa.

i think the general consensus is that the price is not going to change that much at all. 
i would even say that once all the excitement of the halving dies away, price will go down. I would imagine that quite a few miners have been storing coins, seeing which way the price was going, and seeing how the market reacted to the halving. Once they realise that we are at the peak, price will start to fall, as miners start flooding the market with their saved coins. 
It will only be a few months after this downturn, that we will start to see the steady, but slow rise upwards in price.

@_date: 2017-05-18 08:47:54


to be honest, FX currency exchange cards are pretty damn good these days - Revolut being an extremely good example. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:43:34
shit man, feel sorry for you. All going to be ok?
@_date: 2016-07-07 18:35:13
That's what I thought as well. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 08:55:45
yes, shouldn't charge you anything - though your bank may have a fee for incoming transactions on your debit card. You should check this - as banks can be extremely cheeky with fees sometimes (who would have known!). 
@_date: 2017-07-05 00:11:39
Short answer: yes. 
Long answer: who the fuck knows at this point. 
Proper answer: get some popcorn, hodl, and enjoy the ride.

Have Ledger announced anything yet? 
This is really a complete mess isn't it. Ah well.

Any chance you can get the customer support team to get back to me about the bug i found about 2 months ago that appears to not have been fixed yet (sent another email just today for a status update). 
And yes, the bug seems to be quite a big one. 
@_date: 2016-07-24 09:39:02
Was an interesting listen. What I thought was most interesting was that there seems to be a general hesitance with people publicly discussing their opinions of the block size debate.
Andreas talked eloquently about the fact that people should remember the desired use cases/ideologies for cryptocurrencies. I thought that quite pertinent. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:40:04
This is a great read. Thanks for sharing the link. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:31:27
This is true, but do the mooners think it will go up 3x current value by December then? Just wondering. I am not convinced...
@_date: 2016-07-12 23:32:07
Unless all the miners have been hoarding coins waiting for price to rise. For all we know they could be hoarding quite a fair few over the last while....
@_date: 2016-07-14 15:23:24
still a load of optimists here then. i still reckon there will be a big price drop, as the short termers, just get bored, and want their money back. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:38:43
Revolut and btc. This is big news for me. 
The onramp could become as simple as Circle was! 
@_date: 2016-07-10 22:31:35
Agree with this....though at the moment a massive sell off is more likely than a massive surge in buy.
Unless of course everyone has finally the fuck figured out if the majority HODL, we will see a consistent upward surge in price. And yes, I know the miners still have to pay their bills, but surely they are already rich as fuck?!

@_date: 2016-07-06 09:14:42
I still haven't really gotten my head around Electrum though. Obviously those that coded the wallet could easily (unbeknownst to me) have full access to my wallet - as long as i am online. That is the first threat. 
The second threat is that a hacker could place a worm/trojan on my computer that could gain access to my wallet
The third threat is that a hacker to gain access to my computer either locally or remotely, find out my password and thus gain access to my wallet.
Of most concern to me - manly as i am trusting an unknown - is that Electrum themselves could easily have all the information they need to take all my bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 14:04:03

I am very surprised there hasn't been a crash to be honest. Was exoectng it to be very volatile indeed, and it's not.

Lol. I have faith in humanity, and say he can at least trust his wife.
As regards the original post. I actually thought it made things needlessly complicated. Could you not have just said, these are boxes, they have money in them. Here are the passwords to these boxes. To cash them in, you will need to move them to a wallet that allows you to convert btc to USD/GBP/EUR. Surely that would sum it up?
@_date: 2016-07-07 09:44:48
Well yes, but I assume the option is there if you want to send to a different bank account other than the one the debit card is linked to. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 10:39:51
do you mean the highest possible fee for a ten minute transaction?

No problems :-) if you are buying loads, you can always tip me :-p
@_date: 2016-07-11 13:14:20
Possibly yes. If they were just moved from one wallet to another, there would be uproar as people realise that someone is out there controlling the coins. It may have a positive reaction, or a negative one, but the fact that everyone would know that the coins (i think about 1 million of them or something) are available to be sold at any time would cause a shift in the market price. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 08:57:58

@_date: 2018-12-30 00:23:34
Yes, because UX people are capitalist scum and won't work on open source. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:46:29


It's really not. There is of course a chance that he will end up with one coin, that is worth less. This may be through a fault in the code, a fault of himself, a fault in his wallet provider, a fault in an exchange, etc. 
There is definitely some chance he will end up with one coin that is worth less. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:30:24

Any each way to spread the word. :-)

I don't get the first analogy to be honest. You can still have a vegan diet, and work in a slaughterhouse. I am not sure there would be many that would do it, but it would be possible. 
And of course all the things he pays for have a fiat value - as i said, he did not state that the whole of economics has shifted to bitcoin - just that his own personal monetary system has shifted to bitcoin - from his own perspective. From the perspective of both his creditors and his debtors, their monetary system is bitcoin when dealing with him. When they engage in their own monetary system they can use whatever currency they need to. Again, as i said before, it is not his concern what currency they use outside of their dealings with him. Only the bitcoin value of his own incomings and outgoings is his concern - which is what you doubted in the first place - and hence this long winded, and ultimately purposeless discussion. He lives his life on bitcoin - you doubted that. Simple really. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 08:58:22
Yeah found these last night, will have a listen.
@_date: 2016-07-04 22:36:00
yeah, this sounds about right - though it seems so simple, i am sure it has been done before. I mean, surely?
The more i think about it, circle is pretty much it - except that, as far as i know, if i were to give you my email address for circle (which is by default my username - much like paypal) you would also have to sign up to circle, then deposit money/btc to send it to me - which means quite a few steps. 
The way you describe, and what i envisioned, is that there wouldn't have to be a sign up for the sender. 
My public keys are available to everybody - attached to my username (i guess it could almost be a massive database of usernames, and their public addresses)
My public keys would then also be identified by a QR code (as is the norm now) so they could pay through the wallet of their choice without having to sign up to anywhere new.
@_date: 2016-07-06 09:19:12
As far as i know you can make a wallet that is stored on a computer that is kept offline (i.e not connected to the internet). This is also called cold storage. There are instructions on how to do this on the [Electrum FAQ](
This means that the computer stores the bitcoin in this wallet - and cannot be updated on blockchain with movements and changes unless it is connected to the network (the internet). So this makes it very difficult for a remote hacker to get to your wallet (impossible really). You are at risk from local hackers taking your computer, connecting to a network, getting your password and stealing your bitcoins. 
Of course with cold storage, you cannot make any transactions on the wallet, either in or out. 
That is as much as i know, i am sure others will chime in. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 12:52:04
oh come on then, how many have you got!

@_date: 2017-07-05 00:09:20
Realistically, it won't. 
Other altcoins might, and they may well be pegged to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 16:09:22
i wonder what this would be like to own, maintain and run - and whether it would make money (!?) 
My guess is that it would!
the design looks relatively clean as well, to be fair. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 12:26:06
i was more talking about the fact that there is a concentration of miners in one country - leading to a reduction in decentralisation. The worry is for the system as a whole, rather than the miners themselves. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 23:22:11
To be honest, there are few voices in bitcoin that I listen, respect and trust wholly. Andreas is one of them. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 08:39:46
can someone link to the cheapest, relative cost effective method for implementing a node. Preferably a step by step guide that is known to work. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 17:46:52
Never underestimate the purchasing power of under 15s
@_date: 2016-07-07 10:45:16
yes, there is a lot they have invested both now and for the future.
It is not like the halving was a surprise to them - they knew all along. he bitcoin system also compensates with an adjustment of the difficulty rating - from which i understand - affects profits that miners can obtain. 
I wouldn't worry too much about miners dropping out (though a few will, and a few will 'cash out' as you say).  
I would, however worry about a very large proportion of the mining pools being located in China - but that is a separate matter. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 14:17:41
The last paragraph! Lol. Is that was is actually happening in China?

@_date: 2016-07-02 21:23:36
How it worked for me was that you can either a) change the account to a btc account - done in settings, or b) send btc to a bitcoin address and circle will automatically convert USD to btc for you. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:04:51
bitcoin will always have value as currency for illegal purchases, money laundering, and transactions away from centralised banking systems. 
So until something comes along to serve all those needs, either separately or conjointly, bitcoin will always be used as a currency. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 14:00:52
Does seem very good. Thanks! Is there an upper limit on the transaction value?
@_date: 2018-12-28 09:35:57
Probably, depending on the politics of the implementation. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 14:12:22
Indeed. I didn't see the data, but read this over on @_date: 2016-07-14 20:38:10

Congrats though, we all deserve to be happy. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 22:01:02
I was thinking (but i swear if you run with this, and it hasn't been done before you so owe me a tip) that it would be nice to have a platform/interface/application that automatically assigns my username to a bitcoin receipt address that i own.
that way, if someone wants to send me bitcoin, i can just say sure, send it to 'myusername'
i know [Circle]( is very close to this ideal - and works very well - but i think the whole thing can just be simplified again if everybody had an identifiable username that was automatically associated across all platforms with recipient addresses. 
Of course, this may have been done before - and if it has, ah well. Also, if i am just talking nonsense, then of course i apologise. It is late where i am. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 13:07:10

Do you really have 10,000 bitcoins? Come one now, you can tell us ..
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:06:51
He still waiting for it to be delivered sure! 
Seriously though, there are a massive amount of bitcoins still unspent and nobody knows what the plans are/were for them. For all we know they are owned and being held.
If they were ever to be released to the market, prices would plummet. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:41:07
oh yes, you are correct. sorry. 
for some reason i forgot that the transaction is still stored on the blockchain, regardless of whether the wallet is online or offline. Once the wallet comes online - the wallet will be updated and any ins and out on the wallet will be processed - thus showing up as the balance in the wallet as per the blockchain information.
that is more correct, no?
@_date: 2018-12-28 09:32:53
Yes you are right, silly me. 
JP fully understands the nuances of merkle trees, the differences between soft and hard forks, as well as the politics of the segwit bitcoin fork. In fact it's why he chose Bitcoin as his default crypto donation coin, and not some of the alternatives on offer. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:22:54

yes, i understand this, but why do you think it plays out still in a realm that is quite divorced from hereditary DNA, or the survival of the race. 
I can understand why it manifests in sports, for example, but in cryptos, i don't really understand. Having said that, i suppose it manifests in Apple vs Microsoft, or BMW vs Mercedes wars, so perhaps you are correct. Though in crypto it does seem quite heated, and i can only see it getting more heated as we move forward with all this.

@_date: 2017-07-05 00:03:54


No it doesn't. There are the same amount of people in bitcoin. 
If there are 100 people involved with bitcoin now, after a split, there will be 50 people on each chain, but 42m coin supply. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 13:15:59
yes, was says. 
There is not situation where 'everybody' just holds. 
If the vast majority held, then there would be a dramatic rise in price, but at the moment it is probably about 50/50 (a guess really) split of holders and users. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 14:29:54
The main coherent argument is questioning who a bigger block size is ultimately serving. I think that the fundamental answer that the non-core developers attempt to offer is that a bigger block size is beneficial to the 'desired' end user of bitcoin, even though they do not define anywhere that their 'desired' end user is the trader, miner, or profiteer. 
Of course, i may be wrong here - as it seems the core developers seem to understand that the 'desired' user for bitcoin ideologically is the ordinary world citizen (especially those trapped in the damaged and corrupt capitalist system). 
But, please, correct me if i am wrong on this one. 
This is just my, admittedly under-educated, perception of the situation. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:25:05

@_date: 2016-07-07 23:33:49
Someone suggested to me once to use the dynamic fee setting ( which I assume adgusts automatically to transaction volume on the network) and to use the fee multiplier set to either 100 or 110%. 
That should be fine, no?
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:20:23
To deflect panic.
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:48:32
He didn't say the whole supply chain he needs for his goods and services are dependent on bitcoin, he stated that all his own personal transactions are done in bitcoin, so by default his only monetary concern is bitcoin. What others in his supply chain do with the bitcoin they receive from him is their business, not his. You are merely changing the terms of the discussion to suit your needs. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 22:55:50
This definitely makes me feel better. Unless of course you were one of those developers that couldn't do the 'fizz, buzz' problem. ;-)
@_date: 2016-07-06 08:47:54
do you think that personal wallets such as Electrum are safe, or do you think it is in my interest to move them to an offline version of the electrum wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:34:33

I went over there arguing this exact point. it has gone on for two days. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:42:19


If the protocol bends to the whim of a few, or the mob, or the many - it has bent. Once it bends, it will bend again, and again, and again, back and forth, back and forth. You will be left with nothing but two. Ready and waiting to be bent again. 


I have to admit that is a sentence. So let us both applaud the ensuring maths; it is sound. Those throttling the energy of space and time into digital bits of distributed money through consensus mechanisms, game theory, cryptography, process and proof, forks, both hard and soft, and layers upon layers of cream in between - for they are working on freshly iced crystal clear lake. They move slowly, and tenderly for fear - each slight creek and crackle underneath the treaded path may signal the lady to start up on the shore. 


 
No. 
For what you see before you is an apparatus of such magnitudinal change it is but sweeping a chorus of re/evolutionaries along with its tide. The chorus reach far, and wide; some guided, some mis - but we are not to judge. But do not, no matter the guise you walk as the sun begins to set over the hills of the legacy left behind, measure social change through percentage market cap. Do not dare bring that economics through this door. shame. 


Now, we settle on a point. A point as valid as any here before. For i know not these people - unsure of their truth, unknown to the eyes or face - they could be the capitalist incarnate for all i know. For this, i have no response that can sway you, i admit - for our ignorance is our pride. One side may, one side may not. Both sides may, both sides may not. All i can judge is what i read and hear before me. So i ask you, strip away everything, down to the barest of bones - standing before you speckled with fresh crimson: one side seems loyal to the market, 'for the market', i hear them cry. Their libertarian swansong echoing from the walls of their fair chamber, drowning out the vicious vitriol that lurks beneath their bated breath. The other urges calm and caution, for they know that change should not bow at the alter of profit, greed, demand, or supply - no matter the pressure, or squeeze. Perhaps i am blinded by the light, and so be it if i am - time will teach me my own lesson.  


Perhaps. Perhaps not. We will never know. In reality, to postulate that they new 'all', is as wild and carefree as saying they had no idea at all.

I would keep doing it over and over until you have enough bitcoin to make you rich. Then get in touch with both your bank and circle and say you only ever authorised the initial $50 deposit.
If you choose to do this, ensure you delete this thread, and perhaps think of spreading out the btc amongst a number of wallets. 
Just saying... ;-)

@_date: 2017-06-03 13:30:04
The Bitcoin bubble is going to correct?
@_date: 2016-07-06 20:43:36
It really is quite funny the amount of varying predictions there are about this, all from seemingly informed positions. 
Ultimately nobody has a clue. Though if it is true that people are viewing
Bitcoin as a safe haven until global economics settles down a bit, then the fact that the halving is happening at exactly the same time can only be a positive. 
All I know is that I am hoping for a slow and steady price increase for the next 12 to 18 months. Less drama, even if its less fun. 
Having said that, I am ready for a violent crash - as I have seen it happen before and have no real reason to believe it won't happen again.

To be fair, these analytics have been pretty much bang on for a while now. Especially the markers for market resistance. Even though its a lot of gobbledygook in the grand scheme of things, I do enjoy the read. So, thanks :-)

the original comment is only two days old. i know there has been an update in the compatibility, but as far as i am aware, it has not been tested as of yet.

Cheers. Have added to my podcatcher...

to be honest i was really just playing devil's advocate. 
I do trust open source software and have no reason to believe that there is a great conspiracy or developer collusion behind Electrum (or any open source software wallet for that matter). 
I was really just stating that, in theory, it would be possible for the open source developers of a software like Electrum to collude, coding in a method to access online wallets. I am not at all saying that they have done so - but that it could be done. 
I am not a technical expert (obviously) - but you have described a couple of ways in which they could do it, and a couple of ways to mitigate against that risk. Really that discussion is all i was asking for, and i am sorry if i offended anybody working on the Electrum project - it was not my intention at all!

JP does not have the intelligence to understand segwit, let alone his supporters. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:08:23
yes, i know this. I am aware there are issues with the way the network exists at the moment. However, i completely agree that having a protocol that is robust to change from external pressure is paramount to its survival long term. You could have 32MB full blocks and you wouldn't have close to capacity for servicing the developing world, so i think it is more important to ensure that Bitcoin is secure, stable, robust, and resistant to pressure and change first. 
All networks (both theoretical and practical) are built on fundamentally sound base layers - don't forget this, please. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:32:41
would be much easier if DNMs/vendors just stopped accepting bitcoin and demanded payment in properly anonymous currencies. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:32:08
I don't think so. 
If they were to expand the list, let's say to 4096 words (double the current number), i am sure they would try and pick a set of new 2048 words that did not break this ideal list characteristic. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:30:08


Nice. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:03:37
Stock up on the blankets and candles till then. I am sure you can get them online for bitcoin at this stage. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:24:07
But the transaction volume $ is still just as high in Bitcoin as it was then, no?

The HODL strategy outlines the process for ICN holders (though I think it was unintentional). 
@_date: 2016-07-15 21:09:20
that is what i thought! i am selling half way up, just to make sure i am not getting an almighty come down on the way back down.

To be fair, driving these days is pretty damn risky.
But yeah, respect where it's due to the guy. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:54:06


I assume you are talking about the cap being implemented? 
Tell me, was it pressure from outside agents that forced this pressure? Was it market forces that demanded it? 
As as far as i am aware it was a self defence mechanism, as the protocol had not been thought through as perfectly as could have been in the first place


The previous two paragraphs to the quote above, i am not going to comment on at length. You write clearly and politely, but it was just waffle (no offence meant). However, the analogy to a fax machine you made stirred me a little. 
We are in the birth of the digital currency age i am sure you will agree. And there is a chance that it will develop and last into the age. If you were to make an analogy, i would actually think we are at about the telegram stage - we have such a way to go. But of course, i may be wrong. 


Time will tell if I'm right.
Yes, you may well be correct. Time will indeed tell. If what you see manifests, you will have a market driven and controlled coin - successful, no doubt. But don't so easily forget the power of the idiocracy - for if we are all honest and looked long and hard at the shit show that is the market of digital currencies, we might well be alarmed. 
Personally, I have not ever seen so many pigs feeding at the troughs.

because i think tribalism and crypto go hand in hand. I haven't figured out why yet. probably something to do with ego. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 21:11:31
make sure you transfer a few bitcoins back and forth to different wallets on different exchanges as well, just to cover your ass with all the withdrawal/transfer fees. you wouldn't want to miss out on those. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:23:58
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-07-01 10:18:12
It was an exchange that offered that future though, wasn't it?

hi, can i just ask - and this is something that the main critics refer to about LN a great deal - how you can determine that a route will/can be found from one user to another containing the necessary funding levels all the way through. 
I assume the maths is based on some small-world network model, but it would be good to actually see some of that logic - or even know who is working on it, if there is even someone?!
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:19:22
May the HODL be with you. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 10:33:02
I wish someone would come here/there and discuss it properly.
I have been arguing against this paper on since the first paper was published. 
I am not a mathematician, nor a specialist in graph theory, but it would certainly help if somebody who was, got off their ass and put up a decent counter argument to the 'proof'.
I can see flaws in the theory, but cannot prove them...
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:43:49
isn't it four letters? As per [BIP39](
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:53:41
Nah, enjoy the ride and hope for the best. It'll be fine. 
I think we all can see quite clearly that Bitcoin is bigger than any manipulative party, agent, or group. Enjoy the rollercoaster and bring the popcorn. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:35:45
I have just realised that this is a HODL t-shirt for ICN, not for Bitcoin (unintended I assume). 
Bitcoin is the reverse, as you say, whereas ICN is definitely to HODL when price is rising (if you know how the buyback program works in Iconomi). 
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:07:34
yeah, i dread to think about it. At the moment, there hasn't really been any serious inter-coin warfare, but i am not sure that will always be the case. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 12:51:22
the halving will dampen the decline.
you heard it here first. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 12:31:04


Thats actually very well speculated. I am getting my big book of contacts out. Where is that guy i knew that lived in Madagascar?

That white paper did set out the technical roadmap, to a certain degree, we all know that - though it is simplified and, sadly, extremely naive in some respects. You quote bandwidth figures and costs, but do so from the confines of the developed world. While I agree the infrastructural hierarchy will not exist forever, it does now, lest we so quickly forget. That $18 quoted with such gay abandon is almost non-existant in 70% of the country where I live. Yes, the 30% could secure the network for me, of course. Let the developed secure the finances of the less. Oh my, what a creation we have built. 
Secondly, and I am sure you will agree to this, if you can divorce yourself from the pretty engineering posturing that took place just now - that paper did not even start to grasp the political ramifications of a world wide digital currency divorced from state/central authority. You will be lessened should  I you forget the central dogma of the cypherpunk argument for keeping Bitcoin resistant to any market driven, centralised agent, and/or political pressure. 
You may not understand this all now, as you pine for 2MB and sub 10c transactions​, but once that pressure really starts to squeeze, pinch and tingle, by god you will. By god you will.

I am surprised there hasn't been a big drop already. Waiting till we get back to $400 or less, then buy back in I would say.
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:47:16
This is great. Thank you very much. Routing is the hard problem - especially when the network gets extremely complex. I was reading [this paper]( just this morning. Seemed quite interesting in the context of LN.

Of course it is, but we don't see this level of tribalism in most brand wars (even though branding holds such importance these days). We don't see this type of tribalism within universities, geographical segmentation, or even Esports (from what i know). There seems something inherently tribal about crypto. It is actually quite interesting. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:56:01


Well, if you take what has been said here as genuine, you may find that in ten years time the two chains are attacked by actors who attempt to change the protocol to suit their needs. 
The chain that stubbornly refused change when faced with external pressure, in my eyes, would stand a far greater chance of surviving than the one that had already done so in the past.
