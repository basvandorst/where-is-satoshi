Bitcoin was $1000 way back in 2013? Wow, it must be over $20,000 by now, yeah?
@_date: 2017-03-26 05:03:39
Wow, so many experts predicted $2000, $5000, even $100,000 by 24 February 2015 (actual price was $239.65).
Interestingly, this survey was published the day *after* Mt Gox closed and the price was in the middle of a 10-day slide.

It begs the question, why has Bitcoin not lived up to the expert's expectations?
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:59:06
Heres my take: Given the trouble on Fiday with TheDAO hack on investor's minds, when Bitfinex halted trading, some investors freaked out and sold because they thought the situation at Bitfinex, a usually reliable exchange, may undermine confidence and cause mass sells. Investors are nervous and some wanted to offload first. By the time Bitfinex came back online, the BTC/USD price on other exchanges had dropped about $40. Naturally, the Bitfinex price adjusted to the same as the other exchanges very quickly.
Maybe the wool is over my eyes, but that's how I saw it.

The cab driver will not be pleased to wait 45 minutes for 3 confirmations.

Ahgh, this is a disaster in the making. People will make typos and send money to the wrong ID. The longer ID forces a 'copy &amp; paste'. Even typing out the long version and getting a wrong character will not go to someone else's account. Bring on the typo-squatters!
@_date: 2016-06-28 00:08:04
Unlikely as it might be, if someone ever bothers to double-spend $5, I don't want it to be mine! :-)

Bitpay is no faster than wallet to wallet. The payment block still needs to be picked up before the first confirmation, and that alone takes a good while.
To answer your question, it depends entirely on the level of risk you are happy to take. I wont accept anything less than 2 confirmations - even 5 bucks.

I'm talking about typos. Typo mistakes happen all the time, so my concern is that if people *type* in the wrong recipient address and there's no other verification in place (the banks require bank ID + account number), the money can be lost forever. I know, we type simple IDs all the time with email addresses and domain names, but the penalty for typing the wrong ID when sending cryptocurrencies is far more serious than mistakenly going to gooogle.com.
@_date: 2016-06-09 13:15:04
Yes, this would work. Similar to Bank ID + Account ID for bank transfers. But is this in place?
@_date: 2016-06-28 00:11:36
It's just an example.
@_date: 2016-11-10 08:40:03
Thank you, but there doesn't appear to be a PLN pairing in bitcoin.de. Also, I can't find their fees anywhere.
@_date: 2016-11-10 13:51:08
Wow! Again, amazing list!!
I totally agree with Satoshi's vision. My Polish client pays for servers each month with the payments from me, but I don't know if they accept crypto (I did ask him today, but no reply yet).
I agree, bypassing fiat is ideal and things are moving along quite fast. Hopefully it won't be too long until ALL countries have access to all those services you are lucky enough to have in Europe. I am in Australia and there's fuck all available to buy with crypto here.
@_date: 2016-11-10 08:24:05
Thank you! I'll check it out.
Fees look very reasonable and BTC/PLN volume is ok. Just unsure about it's reputation. 2FA authentication available too, which is always a good thing.
Anyone else use Bitmarket?
@_date: 2016-11-10 13:07:17
Awesome! Thank you so much for refining the list for me! The first list is still a very useful resource.
I'm curious to know why bitmarket isn't included in your list.
My aim is to send my Polish client BTC. He would use a BTC/PLN paired exchange to sell BTC and withdraw the PLN to his bank account.
@_date: 2016-11-10 12:38:06
That's a huge list of exchanges! Thanks! Which of them support Poland withdrawls?
@_date: 2016-02-22 21:12:17
Yep, bitcoin xfers are much cheaper. International wire xfers are still an expensive option though, but that's due to bank charges. Be glad you and your friend know how to use bitcoin - many don't, so Paypal can set their rates quite high.

Even the latest version of 'Bitcon Core' is labelled as 'Bitcoin-qt' in windows, hence OP's description.
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:56:49
Bitcoin Core wallet has an option to choose how much you want to pay, so I chose to pay 0.00000BTC. Takes under an hour for 3 confirmations.

Yes, the executable's shortcut label was what I was referring to, which is inherited from the executable filename.
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:22:17
Ok, that's a good idea. Thanks!
The bitpay app is far from intuitive, which may explain why only 0.0011% of my revenue comes from Bitpay payments :-/

Going to be a bit tricky if Satoshi is Dave Klieman (RIP).
@_date: 2016-05-10 13:51:24
Yes, I too have that card and it works great! My life is now much better and just holding it cured my carpal tunnel.
@_date: 2016-05-09 14:16:45
Please, no. All interest in Satoshi would then be lost.

Since formatted posts just don't exist for day one noobs, let's safely assume OP is hiding his identity.
Why would be baited by an annonymous account? If he accepts, he will be accused of staging the entire thing. If he doesn't accept, OP will appear to have achieved his point (to those not privy to wisdom).
This is just a cowardly "hit and run" which shouldn't be given oxygen.
I restate my claim, OP is a dickless coward.
