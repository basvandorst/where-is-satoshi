We all know why tho.. To monetize. I think someone needs to get creative with these things, like a pay per bandwidth model?
But then no body uses it?
Or distribute the load across user devices, p2p style?? Hmm...
I don't know but this comment brings up an interesting problem I'm sure more creative minds then mine can solve here.

Taking 20% of profits? That does equal a loan on percentage, it's a floating percentage. Does that religion allow for floating percentages but not fixed?
Say company one needs 10k to start up... then it starts pulling in 20k a year in profit. That's 4k a year back to the islamic bank for let's say 5 years. That's $20k, that's 100% interest.
Do they think God's not going to notice that loophole? I really don't understand the logic. It's like when rich christians say they're going to heaven because they put God's money to work in their lives to make it more productive to do God's work.... huh?
It's nice that bitcoin is mentioned but I don't really see how this has much to do with bitcoin specifically, but is more geared towards talking about finance in general.
I'd be interested if they gave out loans say... 1BTC and expected 1BTC to be returned, no matter the price.

But the market instrument itself isn’t a government entity, it’s only that it falls under regulation of the sec revelatory body bound by US govt jurisdiction.
Hopefully regulation opens to “high risk” entireties with proper for warning and information to properly inform investors of risk factors.

That wasn’t me you just replied to... and second, did I say it was going to 0? Go back and read what I said, there is always a possibility to go to 0.
What if someone finds a fatal flaw in the code or system and exploits it to make it worthless... what if one person through economics gathers all the bitcoins in existence and everyone says “fuck this” and moves to another currency.
There are infinite ways to go to 0 as there are infinite ways to go to lambo.
Also I’ve been in crypto for at least 6 years now, all predictions are delusional. Past performances never dictate future results. Don’t look for patterns look for truths.

ALSO, make sure to keep his phone activated and stable... he may have 2 factor authentication and use some online wallet service like coinbase...
FML... it's almost like there needs to be some sort of sworn support for this... MAYBE those dudes over at that place that do wallet recovery for a 20% fee would like to take on the case personally and do teamviewer sessions, phone calls, etc... to help on the case??

It would defeat the "I can't afford a bitcoin" and tendency to not want to break down a whole bitcoin into smaller units problem. "Man I only have one, I don't wanna spend any of it"
I hear it all the time and that doesn't happen with doge which is a great live data example of why the change would be positive.

Correct, and many people don't understand that Bitcoin closely follows the characteristics of:
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:12:11
That's to say the same if they purchased Bitcoins from Coinbase and purchased an item from a store that uses BitPay as a merchant processor. Of course there will be variation. This is not unique to Circle.
@_date: 2014-10-01 15:39:44

Righhhtt... I'll put money this doesn't happen.
@_date: 2014-05-05 04:58:30
Because we're in a hoarding phase... No one wants to break down their 1 bitcoin, no one wants to buy another because they say it's expensive...
And the community is too stubborn to move the decimal to make it more fun like dogecoin.
It honestly worries me about this currency long term. I love that it's the first, but some other things are pissing me off.
@_date: 2014-10-12 02:45:19
I really don't like the term bits.
But yeah... I'm essentially wishing that today you could buy 1,000 bitcoins for $0.35
Or 100 bitcoins for $0.04
It makes sense, but currently we're trapped in this model that scares everyone away... and the only failed solution I keep hearing is "bits" which just makes another level of learning for new users that sucks so bad, us seasoned vets don't use it enough for mass adoption!

Never said the portfolio value was different... dont be so stupid.
@_date: 2014-06-05 23:50:47
Coinbase... could you throw around the idea of building in a full blown processor... kinda like a combo of square and bitcoin.
With the option to pass the CC fee to the customer if they choose to pay with that option.
So we could essentially turn our business into 100% bitcoin... buttttt if you want to pay with USD using your CC you're going to have to pay 3% or whatever it is.
It would honestly take away the headache of thinking "how much do I have to mark up my product to cover my overhead from CC transactions" essentially it would allow people to provide the lowest price possible to the market.

But to be honest... my second opinion would be the first time selling short became popular there would a panic sell off in the market dropping price... Then everyone would try to jump on the short selling train and get burned the second time around with a short squeeze.
@_date: 2014-01-13 03:25:57
There would be a short squeeze most likely and the price would go up if the short side was larger then the realized price of bitcoin.
I'm absolutely an amateur, so that's just my best guess.
All I know is that allowing you to go short or long helps stabilize markets.

@_date: 2014-04-07 22:15:48
Not really... but they're trying to make it sound fancier then it really is.
It could work the same way... I post a $ value and tell you what I'll pay for your bitcoin at that moment... Deal? Ok, I pay you with a visa gift card and take a % for my own profit.
There's no risk, they're just linking up with bitstamp to offload bitcoin instantly.
Now... we've establised that this possibly isn't a scam... is it safe? Who freakin knows. This shit startups never do proper security audits because they're too damn cheap to spend the money on a proper outside auditing firm.
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:47:21
I suggest they create a 10 level credit system in which they could verify and have more in depth look at your financial history and habits... Not saying everyone would be comfortable with that, but I honestly don't give a shit if they see my net worth and financial history if it gives me fast low fee entry and exit points.
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:43:00
I have a feeling they'll dominate it... That's how all dominate aggressive forces work over time. They'll move to assets and commodities, dump the debt on citizens who will pay insanely high taxes in Bitcoins, then laugh as they control supply chains for goods and utilities. Those will be the popular money makers for the rich... Water, electricity, and "robotics" aka, any automated system.

But remember... there are risks with these methods too!
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:33:39
Yup, charge backs are seen as a consumer protection method.
Here is an idea to mitigate charge backs... pool of $100,000 investor money to start... super high risk investment.
Sell $100k worth of bitcoin at 50% markup.
Cross your fingers you dont get charge backs... hope you dont go bankrupt. Increase your sales 10% each month while you pay back investors.
Done... at some point you'll have enough capital to float the monthly risk, and be able to lower your margin.

That would be beautifully simple, easy to understand, and help others get into the currency... To be honest if that was the case if tell my employer to pay me in bitcoin.

That still leaves the problem of leaving 1 Bitcoin = 1,000,000 bits. So essentially again you have people still holding on to the term bitcoin and thinking... I don't want to spend my bitcoin or buy another because they're so expensive.
And bits... again, the 1 to 1 million conversion problem.

And lack of transparency. People can't riot if they can't see the bookkeeping.
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:27:07
I've noticed that happens to people that go too "all in" with bitcoin. I've got my savings pile and at times it was in the red. What I did was buy a small amount of spending bitcoin while prices were low. Like $100 worth. With a small gain in price I dont feel bad about spending those, but still held my coins that were in the red until they cleared value. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2014-09-22 04:06:23

@_date: 2014-10-01 06:18:41
You're missing  do they want investors that are part owners. Most small time outfits don't.
Plus, if you think about it, the IPO price would be soooooo speculative and not set professionally. The owner of the company could essentially make it IMPOSSIBLE to profit from the stock.... or give away WAYYYYY too much for near NOTHING and damage the company financially.
The set price of an IPO is done VERY carefully.
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:29:02
In a way.. yeah.. almost everyone I talk to is in it for "speculation"
I on the other hand buy coins cheap, then spend them when they're up in value... it's always a win, and I actually get and do things I want.
I dont understand this simpleton mentality of "one pile of coins"... split your bitcoins into savings and spending.

That's really interesting, I had the same thought. He would just drop the hammer, fork his company and move in the new direction with no lag, no bitching, nothing. You were happy, onboard with his team or direction, or you weren't and it was time for you to move on to a new project somewhere else.
From a business leadership perspective it was exactly what drove success.
Unfortunately we don't have that with this project.

Why is this downvoted? Of course a system could be put in place. The only thing we need to is step away from the small mindedness of working directly with the commodity or currency (whichever you define it)
Building a separate controlled ledger and implementing time and other security standards is possible.

Its very close... few guesses and someone will have it
This is a fun game... what we can tell for sure is that you only use your index finger, and it appears you start with 1, then drop down slightly, double tap a number without moving your index finger, then end on 4... I'll guess again at 1664.

You just said it yourself... "fine" There's the nail in the coffin.
Anytime someone says something is "fine" in marketing... that is the equivalent of crap.
In this life we don't settle for fine, we settle for great. Image is so important, so critical. There are countless examples of projects, products, and services that have died on their name alone and clones that have taken market share just because their name was perfect.

You are absolutely wrong. Saying there is a 0% chance is already defeated because there are others in this thread that feel similarly.

To keep it short you have a controlled ledger, escrow services, security controls, everything a bank would normally have. This layer would in NO way have any access to the true financial layer (bitcoin public and private keys)
There would be a physical check in and check out system. After building a fully complaint account for the customer you would move their bitcoin into a vault. Your bank ledger would then be a representation of your balance. Any mediation would happen through the escrow services, the bank would take margins.
Yes the bank could F you over. I'd like to hear any monetary system with 0 fruad risk.

Also I think it's funny the title of this post is "Stock Split" when the action in no way mirrors a stock split... Creating a new term for a fraction of a stock would never win over the market. That's why after about 4 months (I'd guestimate) "bits" has not naturally worked its way into normal everyday use.
1) it's too scary to jump that many units without worrying about fucking up your 1 million division or multiplication
2) a true stock split for bitcoin would be MOVING THE FUCKING DECIMAL
Today I have 53 Bitcoin, tomorrow I have 53 million... and still .00 decimal to use later down the road as deflation comes around.
Will it happen? Nope... the problem with decentralized systems is that we have no skilled leadership at the top to drop the hammer and force a change. We'll all bicker and argue and nothing will get done. Because of that nature, that is one reason this crypto scares me long term.

It's not happening... so now what?
Create an update and move the decimal point 6 places to the right... wow... look at that. Everything is now right in the world and people can buy bitcoin for "cheap".
And more importantly, the value of everyone else's wallets are now multiplied by 1,000,000
And finally, there's still .00 which is nice and comfortable for all parties.

For the right price I'm pretty sure they'd drop their jobs, and move into bitcoin marketing full time.

"at the retail level" I think your terminology is off. This is an exchange, not retail.
So your graph is from April 2013 to Aug 2014... What exactly are you asking us about? That scope is massive, the only thing I can tell you is that between those periods of time there has been a median increase in the volume and price of bitcoins on that exchange.
Implications of this? There are no implications. You're looking at data over the course of a year. Are you looking for projections for the next year?
Sorry, can't give you that, you'll have to go on your own market analysis. Do you feel the trend will continue? Why? When will you set time markers to validate your predictions. What will you do if your projections are off?
So many questions you need to ask besides "the implications of steadily rising... bla bla bla bla bla" on a historical chart.

Because the news really translates to:
"XYZ signs up with coinbase/bitpay"
Which means.
"They signed up to LIQUIDATE to USD"
Increase in supply, and also we've all learned, sell on the news. So a combination of things.

The alternative is great and all, but it's interesting to know why 1800flowers dropped bitcoin.
This may not be the reason, but I know a small business that decided to take it... they had maybe 1 or 2 transactions then dropped the payment system after the end of year. It just wasn't worth the accounting for those rare transactions.
To top that they also felt jaded by the community since they first asked if there would be interested customers, everyone shouted "YES, you'll have my business immediatly"... then no one showed up.

Hey guys... From a UI standpoint, is as best constructive criticism as possible, have you studied other major market place layouts and color schemes?
I just gotta say, in my opinion as a regular user... And my family as novice. They all agree it's very dark and feels confusing to navigate.
Just saying, other major community driven store fronts have really nailed that as a key component of success.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:48:54
Seems to be the case. 
I think some people don't understand how damaging misinformation can be to this community when you set the wrong expectations and people get burned in reality.
You have to talk about the pros and the cons that how you build trust. Just like we talk about pros and cons of fiat, nothing is perfect. And if you pretend it is you will alienate part of your audience just like we have been alienated away from fiat as we are lied to about inflation rates.

In the short term. Correct, it's not a store of wealth. I keep saying it over and over. Put in $1 and see what you have in a week. Is it still $1 ?
@_date: 2017-01-24 06:20:01
Gold doesn't really qualify as money nor does Bitcoin (at the moment)
Edit: what the fuck are the downvotes for? My information is accurate and correct.
I pay all my employees in Bitcoin so don't say I have a bias against it.
Bitcoin is too volatile so it's not a good store of wealth, and gold is not easily divisible.
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:19:54
Huh? We're talking about money.
Money ABSOLUTELY is for short term use. You can't argue with that. Any observation of reality shows money being short term. Give 100 people $20 and come back in a week and tell me if they're all still holding.
So you're saying it's not money, it's a long term asset, similar to another financial instrument, a bond.
I feel like I'm teaching economics 101 to 1st graders, holy crap.
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:01:27
It's not money, it's a commodity, just like Bitcoin.
Why would you label gold money? It's absolutely not. I think people forget the definition of money just because the word feels good to hear echoed

Right, thank you, it's not money, stop calling it that.

Dude, wtf it doesn't pass the short term test, what more info do you want?
It's done, at this point it's disqualified, have a nice day.
If you feel like it's a good idea to tell your family to buy today and use it in a week, good luck when they are either pissy that it dropped... or happy it went up and later pissy when it drops when they try it again.
Ask anyone who's not an emotional holder who's studied economic systems, Bitcoin is not money.
@_date: 2017-01-24 06:44:00
Correct that's why I said ATM I didn't want anyone thinking that status is static or permanent

We make payouts manually end of week from time sheets and people's submitted wallet address.

We just explain that it's like PayPal but probably cheaper.
It's pretty much a prequalified to work here but for any candidate we'll let them test it out. After their first test transaction they all really like it.
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:22:28
Awesome! If only customers would pay us in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:25:47
Yes, it's our primary reasoning. All other systems have interrupt processes built into them, we never want our payment to workers to be delayed for any reason. They show up to work on time, we pay them on time, that's the deal.
@_date: 2016-12-23 03:32:54
We don't currently have anyone working in Ukraine. I'd be curious to know if there is a Ukraine exchange. If not that would be a ripe opportunity to open one!

I'm not sure. Each week they submit hours and an address. I don't pay attention if the address is the same or new.

I think most exchange them for fiat immediately. I've had to warn many of them against investing in lending scams. I also recommend they stay away from mining for profit but encourage it as a hobby if they budget to absolutely lose money doing it.

On our next round of hiring we'll be posting to look for us there!
@_date: 2016-12-23 04:33:10
Yeah, you'd definitely want to cash out in your local currency. All my workers don't cash out to usd, they cash to local currency.
@_date: 2016-12-23 02:25:11
I think they all use third party and exchange for their local currency. I never thought about the privacy concern. When you deal in the volumes we do it would be massively boring to watch the finances after they leave our wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:24:09
We don't buy to speculate on price changes, nor do we hold or wait because of market variation. Our net result is a dollar cost average essentially.
Those are called missed opportunity margins I believe. We don't care about that because at the time of transaction a debt is to be paid to employees regardless of future movements, that's on them to decide how to risk or handle. Most cash out to their local currency instantly.
Other than that I could speculate on company money but we're not really that interested in that area.
In the grand scheme of things there's no value to us to wonder what value our workers possessions have, it's theirs so it's their business at that point.
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:08:52
Most of our workers are in the Philippines and they can withdraw instantly from atms.
Other then that yes they would need a normal clearing process. But that's much easier since the Bitcoin is their property at that point.
@_date: 2016-12-23 06:17:36
Correct, now I see what you mean! Yeah that would be impossible!
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:14:30
When do you buy your coins?
Couldn't you for instance. Buy coins at the beginning of the month and if the average is higher usd value you'll have left over Bitcoin in your account after paying staff and if usd value is lower you could buy more coins end of month to make sure you don't lose out?
Sounds like there's no way you can't win, but sounds like they front some risk of gain or loss.
@_date: 2016-12-23 02:56:38
Every position, from the backend normal administrative workers to the front end project managers and sales people.
We're a tech brokerage. We help companies stop paying an arm and a leg for service they've paid blindly for years and haven't updated those relationships. Like paying too much for their internet or phone service or IT services.
We also help C level executives by doing quote aggravation and explaining new IT technology to them, like SDwan.
We're the top company globally delivering SDwan to customers and we're proud of that since it's so new!
Our sales people get monthly commissions for the life of the client.
We are 2 years old. Our first year we did 50k, this year we did 1m, next year we hope to hit 5-10m so we're still really small but enjoy the rapid growth!
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:11:45
Ohhh I understand. Those situations are tragic, the corruption is disgusting. If I was in those countries I'd rather just ride the Bitcoin roller coaster and cash out the minimal possible. At least with Bitcoin you have a chance of surviving financially.
@_date: 2016-12-23 02:22:00
We hold the liability while the usd clears into coinbase so we take on the gain or loss. When our workers sell they are instantly locked into a sale price so it doesn't effect them. We mainly use Bitcoin because it makes our global payments easier even if we have to deal with volatility.
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:54:54
Whys that?
For us it's more a pain when it goes down because we wait about a week for our coins to clear.
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:59:02
This is a pain point for us. Traditional banking really slows us down here so to make sure payroll is ready by the end of each week we have auto purchasing set to daily to an estimate of our daily operating expense.
So we front the risk of money in limbo we hold while waiting for it to clear into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-23 19:07:19
Dang, that's an emotional assumption.
Most of our workers are in the Philippines because that's where most of our customers are. Yes we also hire in the US and Canada for those local customers as well.
Sales works well when you have local representatives. Developing countries are hot for new business and the Philippines are hungry for better internet and we can help them!
We pay our Philippines employees better than nurses.
All other employees enjoy the benefits of flexible hours, work from anywhere, and performance reviews every 6 months and no caps to pay.
After all the sacrifices it takes to start a company and create jobs my workers love and say they'll work here forever, it hurts to hear assumptions like that thrown around.
@_date: 2016-12-23 08:01:07
Finance team handles it, from what I hear it's pretty simple because of the transaction logs.
Coinbase has a conversion calculator build into the send function. We all agree their price is close enough and employees are happy even if there is a few cents difference.

@_date: 2016-12-23 02:01:20
Good question, I pay weekly (at coinbase rates) and since transfers are super quick workers don't gain/lose much if they sell immediately.
Yes we pay the usd equivalent at the end of each week. So if they are due $200 they will get $200 in Bitcoin at the moment I transfer from my wallet.
We make sure to set expectations with all workers before they start with us and all have been happy with the system from the feedback we hear.
@_date: 2016-12-23 02:36:08
I still don't follow. We pay weekly so they work for 5 days then receive their pay on the end of the 5th day. If at the moment they complete work on the 5th day if I owe them $1000 then I set $1k at current exchange and press send.
@_date: 2016-12-23 17:31:05
Ease of transmission. Employees are all over the world and the best way to keep them happy is to keep our promise... they show up to work on time and I make sure to pay them weekly on time. Bitcoin is the only way I can make sure that happens. All other systems have interruptions, higher fees, and sometimes random extended waiting times due to financial review or audits.
@_date: 2015-08-08 00:43:22
I have to agree, our company has seen users move to our services and pay bitcoin. Heck, it brings down cost so much we're beating Microsoft and everyone else on pricing for Office 365.

Not being able to figure it out is a small... tiny... microscopic complaint as compared to the fact that they're a tiny company and they're holding my SS, EIN, photo copy of my drivers license, business license, and anything else they had me submit.. like banking and routing numbers
The Scary part is that I can't get in contact with anyone at that company to delete that info off their servers and close the account!
And you bet they're a high priority target for hackers.. think of all that financial damage they could do with all that info.
They're not my competition? How do you figure they are?

The SCARIEST part is that I contacted support and anyone I could get a hold of at the company and begged them to help me close the account (since I don't think it's possible from inside the web portal) and no one would respond.
I'm super scared they won't delete my driver license or other personally identifiable documents that could cause me serious financial damage if they leak.
This company is just wayyyyyyyyyy too small and feels more like a financial experiment.

This may be getting a bit wide on the subject, but seriously I hear this anger/fear in peoples voices...

It's my opinion, no citation needed.
Whenever I see "citation" used out of context it reminds me of the movie "Thank you for Smoking". The lead character says something to the effect of... You dont have to be right, you just need to make people believe the other guy might be wrong...
Unless you have an actual counter point, "citation" is not going to be enough to start a debate on the topic.

They should consider outsourcing the overflow to a third world country, they could handle the bulk/bullshit/generic support requests, and filter the real engineer/critical systems requests backup the chain.
Wouldn't even need to give them access to any internal systems, just have them support from the outside using standard user accounts and google voice numbers to test 2 factor auth, etc...
If they cant handle the support request from that, they pass it up... I feel the pain for coinbase... rapid growth is incredibly challenging!

I had 50... I bought them for 6k sold them for 60k
Wish I could have held but I really needed the money to start my company.
If it's not "fun" money it's hard to hold.
I gave my ex's kids Bitcoin on paperwallets. I hope she took me serious and stored them somewhere safe for their college.

I posted the same thing to coinbase and I think they're starting to hear the need... my idea was close to yours, but there is a USD wallet in standby to pull from so you could fill that with say $5000, then tell coinbase to replace your coins after a transaction. Since the process would be internal, fees would be minimal...

Or... he's playing that angle.

Probalby... it's not perfectly clear, mix that in with trying to scan a QR code off a laptop screen using a cellphone camera just adds all sorts of distortion to the mix.

That's a cool addition.... or maybe a timeout on the login so it can never remain inactive and logged in for more then 5 mins?
Kinda like my banking app.
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:07:40
I use coinbase and send to their email... They'll never really lose it since the transfer is not completed until they register etc... If they lose it after that... Who cares that's on them... I usually release control as much to them so it's more a gift then a credit for a gift. If that makes sense?

If he attempted to sell that off, it would take a longggg time to do so without accidentally crashing the market.
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:57:06
You said, am I not the only one not selling... so are you buying?
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:00:53
Just the observed migration to other platforms, all these new mobile apps especially. As people become more interconnected on FB, the system becomes boring and for my group of friends, we find ourselves censoring what we say because our audience is so wide and what's acceptable to say in front of one group is not acceptable to say in front of my parents, etc.

That's not what I'm asking... From a technical perspective is XBT flexible for updates to match these possible needs?
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:24:24
I can hear the panic in your post.... I hope this is just play money.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:07:03
I think soon... to be honest... I know there's been improvement in adoption in the last 3 months, but not 900% adoption... I'd say 300% adoption so honestly I would think ~$300 would be a target buy price, but in reality, I dont see this going lower then ~450
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:57:44
Lol, nearly spit out my drink.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:05:02
Logistics pains! Post a link so I can buy later!

What's XBT? I thought bitcoins were BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:58:17
Right, but at some point that will end. Is the code flexible enough to account for the need after all coins are mined?
What happens also after the last coin is mined, who then processes the transactions?
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:57:09
I do... but I'd like to know from a technical perspective if the XBT code is flexible?
@_date: 2013-10-07 16:26:35
Mistrial based on lawyers incompetence? Maybe he'll have the argument that his public defender does not have enough technical knowledge to properly defend him? Who knows, big gamble... I have a feeling if you have 600,000 btc, you have an escape plan for the money and backup wallets all over the place.

COINBASE DO YOU HEAR ME?
Please become a multicurrency bank where we can keep deposits of our local currency. Then when we make purchases or transfers you ask us "Would you like to replenish the BTC you just spent?
Also can you put a pin code option on your app... geez, I'm so freaked out someones going to view/empty my wallet if I let them play on my phone.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:41:41
Using coinbase app?
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:39:41
Please put a pincode or some other type of top layer security.
@_date: 2013-12-21 07:21:34
You are correct, and forget the people down voting you... Some of these are triplicates and some are bullshit "node 2847369" nothingness.

I have a feeling this is why the gov't is cool with BTC... they spent a couple million dollars to aquire a wallet with the potential of trillions of dollars. If they threw out the USD and went to BTC completely, they'd still be on top of the world! Kinda smart move... and they took down an illegal drug ring that gave cryptocurrency a bad name... not a bad job.

Eh... fb is already going the route of myspace... the social media space has become very wide, and attention spans are short... Facebook is the new ancestry.com that's about all...
