I lost it.

Second foiled bitcoin robbery in a week, if this is accurate: 
Stay safe out there.

Citibank seems to have no reported issues with crypto accounts.

You can’t be a professional accountant if you claim that short term losses don’t carry forward. Where did you get that from. Lol. 
I would not listen to the rest of the more complex crypto advice re bitcoin if you don’t have basics remotely correct.

I know right! And then that worked out terribly for the value of gold!
Bitcoin is definitely no better than gold, which is a total ponzi.

It's currently the best-researched and least short-sighted solution.
We can always make more drastic protocol changes later. Bitcoin should be designed to last a thousand years. Advocating a non-emergency hard fork in the first decade, solely because fees are a few dollars, is short-sighted in the extreme.

Time for a paradigm shift. Trust less money doesn’t mean you can never trust anyone ever. If you trust your friend, it’s ok to give them some satoshis *before* they buy the movie tickets you discussed. Really. 
Coinbase now has a track record, and people behind it, that make trusting them with smaller amounts a perfectly REASONABLE decision one could make. 
These newcomers are talking about storing fractions of a bitcoin there. The correct answer at this phase of adoption is “YES: go ahead and use coinbase’s hosted wallet, then try their hosted vault service to learn more about security. Once you have at *least* 0.1 bitcoin you can *start* worrying that you “have” to control your keys. (Start with a trezor or ledger). 
Until then, why discourage users from experimenting using reputable ecosystem contributors like coinbase to the full potential?
Without coinbase, bitcoin wouldn’t even be worth what it is today. Ditto if every new user couldn’t even start using bitcoin without leaning to do everything DIY from day 0.

There's no logical reason it can't increase forever. It would still never reach infinity. Plenty of things behave this way. The year is always increasing, population is always increasing. US GDP has always, continuously hit new all time highs and existed far longer than bitcoin. Your argument is false.
