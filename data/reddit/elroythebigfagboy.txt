Where are you from? Because I know in certain areas they'll usually offer two services, but I'm not exactly sure.
Also, do you have anymore money saving guides like? I've been trying to spend a lot of time on and finance but I'm new to it. I've also been looking at the wikis and they've helped a lot.

Yeah they keep increasing because they're pretty much a monopoly at this point. They don't have many competitors so they have free reign to anything they want.


Ah okay that's awesome. I'm going to try to find a lot of related subs and I'll let you know what I find. I've also been using financial Independence a lot and they have some good stuff. It's mostly about retiring early but it's still good.

That's not how it is for me. I have two places that provide internet, one is comcast and the other is a local provider.
It is crazy though how they seem to control certain areas. I'm not surprised when people equate them to Mafias (although that's obviously an exaggeration).
