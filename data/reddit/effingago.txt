I got my ledger from them as well. This was when it was backordered but they were really good about keeping me updated and always answered my emails promptly. Hope it works out for you.

Use Authy app and not sms 2fa. While not foolproof it helps by eliminating one attack vector (sms)

Send it all to one Exchange. Once it’s there convert it to a cheap fast coin (Litecoin for example) and send it to the other exchanges.

Sorry man. When Ive sent money to someplace new (new to me) i sent a smaller amount like a few thousand first to see if the process went smoothly. Once i was confident i sent more. I dont think i would ever wire another 100k if my first 100k never showed up. Hope it gets sorted!

What you’re saying is totally possible, but how short of a bear market did you have to endure before you declared its “never” going back up? Its been what a few weeks? In the past these downtrends have lasted longer.

Anything can happen, I wouldn’t be surprised by anything anymore. In my opinion i dont think they would shutter the exchanges but they will regulate them more heavily, which is probably a good thing. But you never know!

If the bitcoin you bought for $15000 was purchased originally by the seller for $10000 a week before, did YOU lose $5000? No, you bought it for 15k because you felt it was worth it at that time.  Same goes for the next person who buys it from you for whatever price you sell it at.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:32

Well in your original question it was framed in the scenario that you made 1k. You asked if someone (presumably the guy who bought it from you) lost 1k or will eventually lose 1k. They didn’t lose 1k by buying it from you. They dont know (or care) that you bought it for 15k earlier, they only know they paid 16k for it and thats a price they were satisfied with (or else they wouldn’t have bought it) In the same way when you bought it for 15k, it doesn’t matter if the original seller bought it for 1k, 10k or 20k. His losses or gains dont matter to you. You only care that you got it for 15k which was the price you were satisfied with (or else you wouldnt have bought it). 
Now of course what happens to the price after your purchase will determine YOUR loss or gain in the next sale when that bitcoin changes hands again, but it doesnt matter to the next person in line. They in turn will be paying what its worth to them. 
I guess im not good at explaining this lol.

Jaxx wallet is kind of buggy. Check a block chain explorer to make sure the balance hasnt moved from that address. If your using Jaxx on a mobile device try killing it and restarting the app. Make sure the device has good connectivity so it can sync properly.

Spends $10 on Bitcoin shirt. Starts writing posts on TA with fetuccini lines, support bra’s being broken from resistance and condescending triangle patterns. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:21:37
No because your sell for 10,000 is a NEW transaction. Your original transaction, where you bought for 15,000, you didnt lose anything at that time. You paid 15000 because at that time you were willing to pay it. Thats why i said “same thing goes for the next person” wether you profit or lose its up to where you are willing to sell it for.  Hope that makes sense
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:20:43
TA is technical analysis. A lot of people will say “This isn’t nasdaq TA doesn’t apply to crypto.”Which is really BS because TA is simply examining hard actual metrics like volume, moving averages, and trend lines and making the best guesses as where the market can go. Analysts aren’t prophets so they can be wrong. Think of it somewhat like counting cards in poker. You can still lose but you have a better idea of what moves you can make. Google videos of people who do TA on crypto assets. Some informative channels are dobe4ever or crypto sniper (on YouTube)
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:41:14
Possibly. Nothing in TA is guaranteed. However a chicken entrail signal is only bearish if proceeded by a crotch and buttocks pattern. This nasty pattern  is 69% likely to be followed by this triple retracement you speak of. Otherwise if proceeded by a bull run like we have been having, then the least resistance is to the upside forming an erect curving line. Basically a continuation pattern. Its complicated I know!

Coinbase gave its customers plenty of advanced warning how they would handle this. So now you want to sue because you ignored all the notices ? Try reading that shit next time you get an email or you get a pop up when you login. Or sell your fucking crypto and move your money into a savings account where you can blame a bank when you don’t get it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:31:30
Seems kind of bullish now though. The inclining inverted hercules triangle is showing a ramen noodle pattern  over the SMA of the WWE. Overall bullish. 9K target. However if it breaks below the support bra at point A or B in the 7 of 9 waves it may go down. So its either going to go up or down.

You can normally borrow up to 50% of your 401k in a loan. You are simply borrowing against your own retirement funds and in a way you’re just paying yourself back. Most people take out these loans for a down payment on a house, but they can be used however you want. Keep in mind that you also lose whatever gains your 401k would have made from the borrowed amount, but I imagine no 401k has performed even remotely close to bitcoin this year.

It’s easy to look at a chart in retrospect and calculate “oh I could have made money selling here, buying back in here yada yada”. But.....In real time it’s impossible to predict the market. Like right now, Bitcoin is consolidating and hovering around 7000 usd. If you are holding do you sell now before it plunged to the 6K range? Oh wait it might explode upward back to 7600 or to a new ATH! Which way will it go!!? TA might help you make better decisions but it’s still unpredictable. Tread with caution.
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:50:50
Most likely your email was compromised. If someone gets access to your email they can do pretty much anything. If this is the case there is nothing Bittrex can really do to help. They offer 2FA (2 factor authentication) and if you don’t use this then, that was your own choice, but it is something you should enable right now.  
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:42:29
I guess they will be saying the same thing next year when it’s a 5 figure value. “I wish I got in last year, when it was still around $6000”
