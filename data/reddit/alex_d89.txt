how did you find out that they charge exactly 4%? there is no information on their site...
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:57:10
all information must be encrypted... but even in this case what is now: every bitfinex user should report that his personal information has been stolen??

There are a lot of cards to withdraw bitcoin - 
@_date: 2016-08-08 10:52:02
You need to have some bitcoins in exchange, atherwise it's impossible to trade.

What does coinbase say? Is the problem on their side or with the bank where you send bitcoin. If that is coinbase problem and they don't want to lose customers, they should give you compensation.
@_date: 2016-06-30 10:48:13
Looks good for me!

If you've already decided to become bitcoin owner, it's better to do it now than after halving. Ofcourse it is possible that the price will go down, but do you want to lose your last chance to buy it at current price?

Long economic cycles (50- to 60-year) usually end with depression (and war, revolution).  And after population reduction growth of society stability and in economy start again.
@_date: 2017-01-20 08:30:48
totally agree. Institutions that don't following KYS/AML policy will suffer. Not Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2017-01-09 14:52:00
Why did they remove bitcoin option?
@_date: 2017-01-10 09:38:59
Theoretical max value is more than $1,000,000
But this is only "theoretical"

I think Bitcoin will grow either with or without Trump...

Do you need to show the balance of your wallet to others?
There are several receiving and sending addresses in the wallet. So if someone would like to track your coins, that would be hard for him.
If you want to verify that you own certain amount of bitcoin, it is possible to sign a message from one address and show whole or partial amount of your electrum balance.
Hope I answered your question.

You'd better to find service that exchange your amazon gift card codes to bitcoin and there look how much money you'll get. Bitcoin price is very changeable and... almost every service has establishes it' own rate and fee.
@_date: 2017-01-27 14:24:11
Blockchain.info is okay for using like light web-wallet. But I'll never hold more than a little amount there.
Personally prefer to use Electrum.
@_date: 2017-01-20 14:25:31


it means not only rising, but going down also

People will never stop to find truth. Even if they found it, people would not stop, because there always be someone who don't believe.

Why Litecoin is only fourth? It's not fair.

Thank you for useful link)

How can you be sure in this?

Do you mean that this situation can be the first sound about btc-e.com is going to collapse?

I've read WP. But can't understand what is DLN. Could you explain?
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:41:40
Heard that you are running ICO. For what purpose do you need it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:06:32
Another question is WHEN the drop will happen.  It could be at the price of 15K or more than 20K...  When people will stop buying?!

Who knows where the company based?

If electricity got cut and there won't be the interenet, you wouldn't be able to use credit cards as well. Current bank system also can't work without electricity.

nice story. I hope you'll have profit in the end)

Imagine the situation: you urgently need some service (for example, surgery) that doesn't accept bitcoins and you are using Bitcoin only (have no cash, cards, bank account etc.)
Bitcoin card can be a recourse in such situation, can't it?

Many sites convert btc ot paypal.
I used unichange.me a couple of times. Have no problems with them.
@_date: 2016-10-21 12:39:48
what is the cost?
@_date: 2016-10-28 08:05:12
Who saw 1000 USD per 1 Bitcoin this year?
@_date: 2016-10-28 08:25:21
Use 2FA and strong passwords on all your wallets and check carefully where you send your bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-10-14 09:15:08
Yes, it works in such kind of way.
@_date: 2016-10-14 08:21:08
It's true for every invention. Nobody know how exactly new technology will be used in several years and who wil need it.
@_date: 2016-10-14 08:39:32
good job)
@_date: 2016-10-21 12:32:42
Try to use merchant for accepting bitcoins at first as it is easiest way. See how much bitcoin customers you'll have. And in future you can make research on other possibilities accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-17 11:53:50
here  is an interesting story how one guy convinced his wife of Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-10-17 12:29:38
I heard that it is possible, but myself use unichange dot-me to buy bitcoin. They can be trusted.
@_date: 2016-10-12 09:42:48
You can exchange bitcoin to paypal or order a virtual card on unichange.me and than rent a car.
Ordering the virtual card from them is free.
I tried to transfer bitcoin and got funds to my paypal within 5 hours.
@_date: 2016-10-11 12:28:55
I agree that there are some risks with holding bitcoins, but having fiat money is more risky.
@_date: 2016-10-14 09:17:02
nice story about how to convert your family to bitcoin ;)

"If the market cap for the cryptocurrency remained unchanged and everyone got their 10% more coins, then you're right where you started - you own the exact same percentage of the economy as you used to. The inflation ate your earnings."  - like it
@_date: 2016-10-12 09:47:53
You are limiting your potential market share by accepting only bitcoin? You really don't want accept other payments?
@_date: 2016-10-11 12:31:08
the price is going up, up and up )
@_date: 2016-10-21 12:05:27
It looks like scam. Don't send them real money...
@_date: 2016-10-14 08:12:32
Don't use blockchain.info wallet. There are two reasons for this: 1. webwallets are in general less secure and 2. their wallet is terrible.
I could recommend Electrum. It is easy to use and convenient.
@_date: 2016-10-21 11:59:48
Looks like a tasty-tasty doughnut...
@_date: 2016-07-15 12:43:53
People buy bitcoin and then send them back to fiat as they expect their funds will grow while having been bitcoin. We start treating bitcoin like any other currency. Isn't that help bitcoin adoption?
@_date: 2016-07-28 10:53:16
Why don't use services that offer special cards to withdraw bitcoin on them?  or 
@_date: 2016-07-28 11:01:20
Totally agree! International payments will become faster with bitcoin as soon as we don't need to change it to fiat any longer.
@_date: 2016-07-15 13:28:08
Agree with these men.  Do you notice that Gold failed to substitute fiat (1000 years over after the quote). Let's hope Bitcoin will be more successful!
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:14:30
It's impossible. All blockchain transactions are final!
@_date: 2016-07-21 13:40:35
Good for bitcoin to be mentioned by celebrities anyway.
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:10:37
Agree with you. Bitcoin is strong now. We'll see incrediable increase in number of bitcoin users in the nearest future.
I hope so)

The video is from 2013 ("German TV Award 2013"). There were a lot of secrets that time.

I use unichange.me. You can transfer into and out of BTC-e USD codes there. It is faster than send wire transfer to btc-e
@_date: 2016-07-18 15:02:32
Blockchain is an incrediable technology. Sonner or later banks will use it.
@_date: 2016-07-18 11:01:50
 they show average USD market price across major bitcoin exchanges
