I am 100% serious. I've seen Segways twice in my entire life. Once was in mall in the suburbs of Chicago, the other time was a Segway tour along Lake Michigan in Chicago.
I could be wrong, however. Most of the places I've lived in or traveled to were in the southwest, southern, or central US. What do you consider a major city in the US?

I did this last year after about Zimbabwe's financial woes on a podcast last year. That look pretty neat, and I can say I have I trillions in foreign currency.

Asking to be paid in bitcoin at any other job fair is a great way to not get hired. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 05:38:59
Is that where it came from?

That's highly inappropriate for this subreddit.

I kind of wish I bought later. The only way I'll make my money back now is if the price ever goes back up to 1000, or close to it.

What's so damn funny?

Segways aren't pervasive at all. When they debuted in late 2001, it was touted as the future of personal transportation. Suddenly walking became obsolete. This was a revolutionary way to get from A to B.
Today you'll find them in very specific business markets and with high spenders. It's definitely a cool thing, but it's just not needed. Nobody really cares about it anymore. I'm surprised to learn that they are still in business.

oh yeah, that's real nice

No worries. I recognized it because I'm on Qoinpro too. The only way to know if it will pay out is you get a lot of referrals. It might work if you already have an established personal website or blog, but otherwise it's awkward for both parites. It's often annoying and intrusive, especially in an open forum like this one.

If the price was related to income tax returns, wouldn't the price steadily increase starting in mid-February? April 15th is only the deadline for filing your taxes with the IRS.

Looks pretty sketchy to me

I saw that too. I wonder why it is like that.

It's not just that. He's pretty damn progressive and libertarian, but he prefers the cash only business because of its simplicity compared to electronic banking. Cash is still king, for now.

I think this is the first time in my life that I wish I had CNBC.
Good luck, Fred.

Unless he converts them into cash locally, the IRS will know about it.

I was blindly believing in it. I should have cut my losses a year ago.

I didn't understand bitcoin when I dumped my money into it. I should have been smarter about how I went into it, that's all I'm saying.

I'm holding out for the same reason. I'm still in the black and can cash out at any time for my ROI, but I'm waiting to see what will happen next.

Just downloaded this app. It syncs with my Coinbase account. Shows my balance, transaction history, and current exchange rate. I guess it lets me trade and send BTC as well.
Not much to see here.

No way. Any day now all of the Chinese subscribers are going to unsub once their gov't declares non-default subreddits illegal. 
It's going to plummet to 50K subscribers.
