"It may be a stupid question..."
Well, at least she knows.

Oh, so NOW that everything went to hell, the fact that Mt. Gox used to trade in Magic cards is valid criticism?! Funny. I remember when Bitcoin enthusiasts rejected that notion wholeheartedly.
Hindsight is 20/20 and all (but funny how the critics were ahead of the curve on that one).

...or someone trying to deny something by mimicking what the layperson would say.
Here's a not totally similar comparison: 
"I never had sex with that woman, Miss Lewisnki..."
"Well if they were having sex he wouldn't call her something that formal, that right that proves he didn't do it -- they aren't even on a first name basis!"
TL;DR -- there's other reasons why someone would call it "the bitcoin". In and of itself, it proves nothing.

1) No one was before and that made no difference so I don't see your point?
2) It's not like regulations prevent you from using a certain stock exchange/bank. Unless to protect you from things like the very insider trading the OP is complaining about. 
"In the real world, Mr Karpeles would be in jail for this kind of blatant insider bullshit" is absolutely HILARIOUS because for years, bitcoin supporters hailed the glorious unregulated Wild West that is the bitcoin "industry", yet at the first sign of trouble you people say things like that. How exactly would he be in jail if there are no regulations regarding what he did...? You want to have your bitcoin cake and eat it to.
I'll never forget this one, from an earlier crash:  
What's that? Regulations are evil but at the first sign of trouble you wish there was someone or something that would pump the breaks and protect the market...? Why not let the market implode...? Has it not decided that...? 
Ahhhhh, it's different when it's YOUR money on the line. If the Invisible Hand gives you the finger, THEN something should be done. I see.
It's been said before and I'll say it again: it's WONDERFUL to see the bitcoin community come up with/ask for some kind of regulation, crash by crash.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:16:25
Still no. Sorry.
@_date: 2014-03-04 05:07:08
You CANNOT be this clueless.
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:58:51
...I thought the beauty of Bitcoin is that there's no regulations whatsoever?
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:12:15
Well, yeah, some people are masochists.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:57:55
No, it doesn't. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:51:02
I don't get your logic.
Satoshi says to reporter that he was involved with the Bitcoin project:
NO WAY! NEVER! HE IS A SECRETIVE AND ELUSIVE MAN! HE'D DENY IT!
Satoshi then says to another reporter that he was NOT involved with the Bitcoin project (exactly what you people originally say he'd be more likely to say):
SEE I TOLD YOU IT WASN'T HIM!

Now that's just a moronic statement. No wonder she deleted it. My dad works in IT and doesn't know bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:29:48
One word: MtGox. Or any other exchange that was hacked leaving bitcoin owners holding the bag.
This explanation is quite disingenuous.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:42:01
The biggest complaint about the Brazilian economy (the largest down there) is how tightly regulated it is. You literally have no clue what you're talking about, as if these general blanket statements dodging the question weren't making that clear enough already.

Counterpoint: DreadPirateRoberts.
Sure he isn't as smart as the creator of bitcoin, but the point stands. He was careful with his identity... AFTER the Silk Road became a huge, potentially dangerous thing to be involved with (and even then, not that much).
Not saying this man is the creator of bitcoin, just saying smart/careful/elusive people make silly mistakes sometimes (and that pointing out that a mistake is "uncharacteristic" of someone -- especially someone you literally know nothing about -- is far less proof than what was presented in the article).
Food for thought ;)
@_date: 2017-01-03 22:39:07
Do we know for ire how many Bitcoins he has?
@_date: 2017-01-03 20:17:02
What are the alternatives if this were to ever happen?
@_date: 2017-01-03 19:48:24
I've been a bitcoin doubter for years, but I have to admit this is pretty impressive.
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:53:00
I think you are missing my point. It's impossible to shut down Bitcoin in the same way that it is impossible to shut down torrent, no doubt. What I mean is, if Bitcoin was illegal to use as currency, businesses wouldn't touch it. Given that business adoption is (was?) seen as the main driving force to "normalize" Bitcoin, to make it go mainstream, I imagine such a move would seriously damage its potential. No?
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:19:59
Breach of contract, or assault? Definitely. We agree there.
Being criticized? Not so much. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:46:43
Jesus Christ man. I don’t mean to be a dick but having to spell this out is quite ridiculous.
Who does a private citizen seek out when they want to sue someone? 
Which entity governs the process and doles out judgement/punishment? 
If you think a lawsuit involves ONLY “private citizens” you must have a 10 year old’s understanding of legal proceedings. The STATE presides over the matter, the STATE decides who’s wrong and right, the STATE enforces the decision.
Should you try to act against their ruling, you’d be imprisoned or ultimately killed if you resist strongly enough. 
That’s what “monopoly on force” means. The government is the ultimate arbiter of all legal matters and trying to resist their final decision means either prison or a grave.
SO, when you sicc the government on someone over words they said, you are effectively attempting to have the government punish someone over speech. 
Someone who truly believes in the concept of free speech would NEVER EVER summon the State to interfere with someone’s speech. 
That’s the absolute opposite of what freedom of speech means. 
For a bitcoin advocate you’re shockingly uninformed of a lot of why the libertarian community supports the concept.

@_date: 2018-12-28 03:18:10
Considering bitcoin caters philosophically to anarchocapitalist types who are fundamentally opposed to the idea of siccing the state on people over mean words, no matter how mean they may be... I don’t think your position is one that a big chunk of bitcoin advocates will support. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 10:55:43
It’s always examples like that. “I need bitcoin because otherwise if I cross state lines with 500k in cash the police will seize it”
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:21:41
That’s being a hypocrite and a child. If you don’t actually uphold your principles, you don’t have principles. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 11:07:32
It’s not exactly “behind your back” when they make you fully aware of that fact, is it?
@_date: 2018-12-29 13:36:01
...is that what they did to JP...?
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:20:28
Yes, it literally means that. Freedom from consequences from the State. If private entities choose to not do business with you over your behaviour? That’s fair game. 
But the State stepping in to punish you over words, employing their monopoly on the use of force/imprisonment?
That ain’t freedom of speech, bud!
@_date: 2018-12-29 11:15:01
If you willingly enter into a contract and don’t read the agreement... who’s really to blame here?
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:30:46
I’ll spell it out for you.
If he wins the lawsuit... what happens then, friend?
Where do you GO to sue someone, again, by the way? Which entity do you petition to sue someone...? I’ll give you a hint: it isn’t McDonalds.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:24:32
I’ll let you in on a little secret that most Peterson supporters are wholly unaware of.
Bill C16 mentions pronouns exactly zero times. That’s not what the law intends. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 10:52:38
Ok but honestly who’s walking around with 10k in cash 
I’m not saying this makes civil forfeiture right but come on. Tell me ONE practical, non-drug related reason this is a thing anyone would want to do.
Sure you should be allowed to do whatever with your own money. I just can’t imagine why you ever would.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:22:32
Well, I’ll let our fellow thread-readers chime in on that one. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:49:02
That's what the currency need, a petulant barely-out-of-his-teen-years chump thinking he's in the position to "school" anyone about it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:14:44
Sell that shit RIGHT NOW. In fact, if you're smart, you have already.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:06:33
but but but but what about the invisible hand of the market, laissez faire, regulations and protections be damned...? Seems to me the market chose to screw you over and you got bailed out, so to speak.
