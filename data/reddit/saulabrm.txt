So far I have understand that printing money = inflation.. while it can hurt the economy by someone (being an organization, group or government) taking advantage of it.. it could also help the economy to generate jobs and a growing economy (loans and low interest) right? Or is this system design to fail?

This is what I was looking to understand, I appreciate it.

Thanks for the answer. Seems that you have some deep opinions about it. Any read you should recommend? I’d like to be more informed from different angles.

This is a great response and I highly appreciate it.  And have the same question than others.. Any particular book/movie you could suggest worth to start with?

How a gold standard prevents national autarky?
How interventionist manipulate prices and wage rates?
Who intents/ what is  credit expansion ? And how does this is the panacea of all economic ills?

Thanks I’ll definitely come back if questions! It’s an exciting book!

Nah just directing to do research and then everyone can develop an own opinion.. I consider it promising, but risky as well.
@_date: 2019-06-15 21:47:29
Sure, then just share it/them.

I like this response.. “they saw the potential loss of everything and still decided to invest their money.” 
Now I don’t want to shill anything here but I would recommend taking a read on the IOTA protocol, which is intended for machine to machine economy.. this project either goes incredibly BIG (meaning Trillion).. or fails trying..
But this is only my opinion. Things could get interesting in the next couple of weeks..

Checkout binance jersey.. they have been a really good company and working through expanding its reach by having regulated exchanges in different locations

Of course.. you just have to say “Bitcoin”  three times in front of the mirror.. spin three times and just wait to see the gains.

Maybe it could be good in some way.. to stimulate economy.. but it is abused.
The way I understand it, inflation is created by printing money, which inflates the assets... 
This only benefits the people who actually own assets, so only the top percent of the population actually see that benefit,while all other people (most) who barely can save up money and live day by day, only see the downside.. which is their money losing value
Again is my opinion and the things I’ve been learning on the way... still trying to learn more day by day

Yeah so maybe the USD is backed by immense political power.. until it is not.. until it ceases to be the federal reserve currency for many countries..
In another perspective you said bitcoin is said to hold/increase its value because as years go by you normally can acquire more things for the same amount of bitcoin. This is not the same with FIAT currencies.. which are easily printed and have inflation. So as years go by you need more dollars to purchase the exact same thing.
I guess one could say that bitcoin is good for many things.. I am not an expert but I’d say:
* it is a good hedge, against inflation and manipulated currency
* teaches and allows us to be our own banks.
These comes with many benefits, but also responsibilities

Lol I get scared when it’s low!!! Whadamagonna doooo can’t check CMC!!!

It’s immediate.. you have to see that your order gets executed .. so if you place it but there is none being sold after price you had anymore.. then you only left a pending buy order..
You could cancel the order and put it again.. or hope/wait for it to come back to your price

Revolut is legit.. I use it to get better conversion rates and pay for vacations in other countries

Apparently this is what they are doing with the game Paracosm and IOTA.. I guess. don’t know the details though
