I think that's the second part of the trade process. I'm still on "Wait for blockchain confirmation"

I think it has been 9+ hours. I'm just going to guess that I did everything i had to do and wait.. I'm just trying it for fun to see how it works.

The first time I tried clearxchange I entered the sellers info on clearxchange to pay him and it said the sellers bank does not accept money sent from clearxchange. I put a support ticket out on Bitsquare about it and they said "unfortunately it seems clearXchange does not work very reliable." And we both got our reserved BTC back. The second time it was the users fault for having an old version of Bitsquare. So I guess I'm 0 for 1 with clearXchange. I guess I'll try clearXchange one more time.

How do I do that?
EDIT: Got it

I know, I know, sorry about that. I wish it was just about Bitcoin alone. I just love seeing anything about Bitcoin.
