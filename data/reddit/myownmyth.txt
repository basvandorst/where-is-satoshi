is there a way to split up transcription via a python script or something? I'm definitely down for helping transcribe.

IMHO, I would have no problem with all of these open ended "you can't criticize bitcoin" posts automatically being downvoted or even just bot-d (searched for a legitimate complaint) and then deleted.  
 
Aren't the majority just either i) trolling or ii) ignorance?  
  
Conversations are often brought down to the level of the weakest contributor. We have some brilliant and forward thinking people in that have enough distractions.  
  
I mean, **the community here is sincerely interested in a real complaint**. They don't come in the form of a post titled, "Why does this sub not tolerate criticism of bitcoin?"
