What a fucking ass

Good for you, turns out feelings are worth more than facts these days anyways. Got an actual... citation or any evidence for that? The rest of your incoherent ramblings seem to rely on this shaky premise. 
Also lol, the wiki link was to explain my terminology, because I assumed you wouldn't understand what the burden of proof is. It's not proof of the object of the conversation, which you are the one that needs to provide, as you are the one stating something, so the burden of proof is on you, which is *hilariously and ironically exactly what the burden of proof explains*. 
If you're a troll, 10/10 please go back to your cave, the levels here are just inspired. If you're just an idiotic cunt, please stick your head in an oven for the sake of humanity.

No, he's full of shit which has been shown over and over again. He posts the bare minimum and posts "alternative" facts to cover up his past lies. When challenged, he pumps up his chest and offers to take "bets" over whether he's telling the truth or not but never posts proof. Instead, he never follows through, deletes the comments, and acts like a right cunt. Don't believe him.

They should.

You keep telling yourself that. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 14:31:00
It's not crazy when he's a serial liar who continually posts bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:24:31
The best trolls know just enough to get by, but that just means they're slinging more bullshit to try and cover up their old bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 14:26:13
Because he's a serial lier. We really need some mods to shut this asshole down. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 14:29:19


So you're a cunt then?

The burden of proof is not forced on someone by someone, it is inherent in the nature of stating a proposition:  
I certainly won't rush to your defense if anyone were to call you a complete asshole, but if provided sufficient evidence I would indeed defend the validity of the facts, which is to say if provided sufficient proof, I would respond to people doubting you with links to that proof... along side a recommendation that they don't waste any brain cells or money on you in the process.

Don't worry, I'd bet 12 eleventy billion that he can't hang. And my word is probably better than his!

You don't get it. The burden of proof is on you. 
Prove it, or accept that people will take what you say with a grain of salt, that's all there is to it. 
P.S. You sound really sick. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 14:19:27
Go on then, we're waiting. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 14:27:13
You enjoy the fact that he's acting like an asshole to everyone? 
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:56:25
The only people who demand money be thrown on the table before they provide proof for things that *the burden of proof is already on themselves for* are liars and scammers. 
Get the fuck out of here with this bullshit just admit you're hosed or post proof, and if you ain't going to post proof, then accept that it's a completely reasonable position to assume you're absolutely full of shit. 
Get over it, it's the way this works. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:14:26
You really are a cunt aren't ya? It's like listening to one of trumps speeches. I award you no points, and may god have mercy on your soul.
