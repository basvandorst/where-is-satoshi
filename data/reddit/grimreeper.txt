Maybe ask [coinninja](  
He reported a vulnerability to coinbase and got a quick response, or so he says.

This is wise advice. People need to stop being so butthurt, making sensationalist stories and screaming about the sky falling.

This teacher sounds terrible, it sounds like they don't even know what they asked for.  
"Please write a opinion piece. You will only pass if I agree with your opinion." That is some fail teaching.

Your AMA was great, enjoy.

Maybe, or maybe the teacher is just naive and fearful of modern society.

You are making it sound like all banks charge monthly or annual account keeping fees, which is untrue. Several banks have accounts that have zero account keeping fees.  
NAB and ING Direct come to mind.

Good to know you notified coinbase instead of trying to take advantage.

If you go by this subreddit yes. In reality, probably not.

I went to one of these events years ago. I only went because it was free and also had Tim Ferriss and Richard Branson. Jamie McIntyre's speech was terrible, super scammy and was just like a spam email from a nigerian prince.

That could be interesting.  
"New talk: The central bank ponzi scheme and the bitcoin revolution"  
or  
"Quantitative Easing, the government ponzi scheme, is bitcoin the answer?"

I'm happy with BTC Markets for all my Australian bitcoin needs. 
What can they offer me that I'm not already getting?
@_date: 2014-03-16 03:15:40
Another overstock.com ad referencing bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 10:44:15
Have you used [BTC Markers]( I have and continue to use it. 
I haven't used CoinJar but I met one of the guys behind it and I don't think you could go wrong using them either.

Australia also has civil forfeiture. 
If you read the wikipedia page on this, the level of corruption by the police is fucking insane.

Reddit is hard to please. A lot of people are asking MtGox to get a PR pro. Yet Reddit will complain when a PR person responds instead of an engineer, giving the normal bs answers they are so fond of that include no details and just beat around the bush.

Hmmm, wonder if I can crack it open and diy a passive cooler for it, maybe a noctua d-14.

Awesome, keep the miner going during a power outage.
@_date: 2013-07-20 09:07:37
It's a two part process. Key to the strategy nolanross suggested is flooding the market with 15 cent bitcoins. Suddenly no one will want to pay any more than 15 cents for a bitcoin, causing the price to plunge.

Cloudflare is only one of a number of DDoS mitigation providers. Mt Gox said they used Prolexic if I remember correctly. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:31:57
Means that the increasing popularity of bitcoin was probably the initial stress put on the infrastructure of Mtgox, then when they got DDoS'ed it just added to the problem.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:55:05
Which subreddit would that be?
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:50:38
If 80gbps is a metric fuck-ton. What do you call the 300Gb/s that hit spamhaus/cloudflare? 
@_date: 2013-01-26 14:38:05
I believe it is "Moshi Moshi"

Off topic but 1 bitcoin is a lot of money to have on you at the moment. I don't carry anywhere near that much cash.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:45:56
Donated 14 mbtc. I was going to donate to wikipedia but happier to donate to a bitcoin supporter.
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:04:18
Didn't Mt. Gox say they use Prolexic for DDoS protection? Makes me think prolexic isn't working out well for them. Perhaps a switch to AWS or Cloudflare would be in order.

Let's just hope it performs better than the Facebook IPO.

"help him set up his website to accept payments."  
Are you going to set him with shopify? Since he might still be skeptical I reckon it is a good idea since shopify isn't purely a bitcoin company.

I didn't realise that the SC had a fan in it. Is it very noisy?

[Spartans Hold](
I bought it at $1000 when it dropped from $1200 thinking it was about to rise again. No regrets as I also bought in at $15

Or so they say.
