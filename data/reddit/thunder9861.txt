That is correct, it doesn't protect against screen recorders or key loggers, only disk writes. You could get a little extra protection by running inside of a virtual machine and using an onscreen keyboard, but basically if the host is compromised, all bets are off. A tails live cd is best, but it can be tricky in some cases.

I believe some modifications to file-to-address.rb can be made to generate namecoin addresses instead of Bitcoin addresses. My guess is the prefix is the only thing that needs to change. Just be aware that namecoin also uses a blockchain, so you still aren't avoiding bloat, just moving it around. That said, a single transaction isn't much bloat, unless you are going to hash multiple documents. I'd be more worried about the loss of coins; there are other ways to store hashes in the blockchain without losing the coins by using the op_return code.

Excellent list. Here is an example of how to use the notary feature:

You can put a hash of your identity without worry. This gives you the ability to prove the existence and state of your identity at a specific point in time.

Can you go into a little more detail of what you are trying to achieve? I think the problem you will run into is that namecoin has a different prefix, which will also affect the checksum. See  for more details. But the hash part of the address is generated the same as Bitcoin, so you can get an address that represents the same hash.

I had a similar problem as OP, and did a similar thing as you did. I wrote a script to make sure that the wallet generation never touches the hard drive:

I think your math might be wrong. Isn't it 2048^24 ?

My computer is not powerful enough to make any significant progress in mining. It's there anything I can do to help cast my vote?

There is a difference between "sweeping" and "importing". Sweeping means all funds are transferred from the paper wallet address to a digital wallet address, and is the right thing to do.
Importing means your digital wallet will manage the private key on the paper wallet, but the funds will not be moved. This is not a good idea, as you lose the security of the paper wallet.

I just switched over as well. I run a full node, but I'm not mining, and as I understand it, only the miners running XT count in terms of votes, correct? Is there a way to see percentages of miners running XT?

Please explain and I can make corrections to the article. Thanks!

I know this part of the analogy is a contention point, but I feel that it is easier to conceptualize a lock and key than astronomically large numbers, especially for people not familiar with Bitcoin's mechanics (which are the people this analogy is geared toward).

Look into Bitcoin armory. You will need a pc that is "air gapped"; it never goes online. Make a wallet in offline mode, create a paper backup, and send your coins there. Be very careful and thorough.

You mentioned that you were interested in more methods for timestamping. The techniques discussed [here]( can be used to timestamp to a small window. The post is about timestamping a GPG key, but it can be applied to any data. The best part is that it can be done without any 3rd party help for the truely paranoid. According to your spreadsheet, this method is similar to BTProof's method.
