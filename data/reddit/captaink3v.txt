Haha dude sometimes people dont want to play with you because you're a douchebag. Not because of a secret government conspiracy.

The greatest tragic sob-story ever told
@_date: 2014-02-17 16:01:22
well actually my good sir, if the goal of dogecoin is to get to the moon, those who mine/trade/use dogecoin are called shibes, then a shibe in space would be an adequate answer to the question mission accomplished. It could be interpreted as "Yes because we're almost to the moon." or "Not accomplished but we're on our way!!!!!"
So i invite you to suck it good sir, i have bested you in this competition of hearts and minds.
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:45:30
Still got nothing. Ive pointed out why you're and idiot. All you got is "u mad bro?" And yo gramma sucks dawg. You know for somebody with an overinflated sense of intellectual superiority, you are pretty bad at addressing literally the only thing ive been calling you out on for the last like 10 hours. Jesus you're stubborn. This isnt like your classwork in the social sciences, this is the real world where you actually have to be right and by be right I mean be demonstratably right. Not just say "Im right and you're and idiot."
Unrelated note, im right and you're and idiot.

pretty sure at least one dude did. quotes are "super edgy" too bro. Wah! Much fedora very dark!

FTFY 
EDIT: Fuck, so apparently both are acceptable spellings. Thats what i get for skimming the google search. Moving past that, my argument holds as you wisely chose not to assault the merit of what I said (as it is unassailable) and instead focused on how i said it. Your inability to think critically and instead focus on things that Clippy the retarded Paperclip from old MS Word versions does not surprise me. It's like its not your first time losing an argument and you are trying desperately to not appear like a stupid douche. Good Sir.

@_date: 2014-02-19 13:09:42
I've never seen someone get this worked up. Why do you keep replying to me. Why does this mean so so much to you?
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:14:24
I'm touched that what I say has so much meaning to you that you need to write out a reply each time. It's sad, but at least now you have something.

You really should watch it
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:54:38
It's been a while since I read these. It's a challenge to reply and not read what you've written, but I get by.
Calm down.

Welcome to capitalism bro
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:07:25
Soooo you got nothing. I win. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 04:31:05
Kid I hope you are like 13. Never give somebody 2 grand in cash without a contract. As it sits, you're gonna have yo just wait until they feel like selling. Also why waste your time with bitcoin when you could invest in dogecoin and take that shit to the moooooooon
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:51:53
Tldr. Take a loss bro. Happens to the best of us. And besides im sure you're used to it
@_date: 2014-02-17 15:39:59
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:57:39
Wow... no excuses. thats embarassing
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:49:05
Every message you try something new. This is really eating you up inside.
@_date: 2014-02-19 10:13:27
Just relax. Take a bit of time. You don't need to throw yourself into a rage every time someone makes a joke and you look a little stupid.
We're just repeating ourselves now right? That the game? CAUSE IM GONNA WIN AT THAT ONE TOOOOOOOOO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:06:36

Ehh i always want to win, thats what makes me a winner. And go ahead and try to explain how i was wrong in my explanation as to why a shibe in space was not an adequate response to you asking "Mission Impossible" So far, you haven't actually made a point, just said "Ill refer you back(sic) the (one of many) embarrassing actual points." 
You must be an english or sociology major right? that or barista. only they would care so much about diction and syntax and still lack the cognitive ability to say anything of substance
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:49:28
See that's why you're a nutter butter. You think it's the government. Thats silly. almost as silly as your aluminum haberdashery.
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:54:21
You fucked up the link, whilst you were mocking yourself.
So many facepalms. You have to carry this on now lol, it would be far too embarrassing to actually reply :D
Go on, copy and paste. I command you.
@_date: 2014-02-18 06:32:37
I called you out on ignoring what i said and instead focusing on grammar and spelling. you focus on grammer and then proclaim that we tie. apparently thats ripping me to shreads. you must not know what winning looks like. apparently, you think a tie and calling somebody a dummy is winning. That would be depressing if you weren't such a colossal psseudo intellectual douche. That just makes it kind of funny :D
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:43:19
Probably doesn't leave you with much
