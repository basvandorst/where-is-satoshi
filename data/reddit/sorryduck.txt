Buy a Happy Meal and invest it into something with lower risk.

So what? Then people can do something else. Fewer apple farmers = fewer apples = scarcity drives value of apples up until somebody starts producing apples because it's profitable.
Who says the price of apples won't go up?
Where's the problem? 
Sounds like some communist mumbo jumbo where value and price are detached from supply and demand.

Excuse me but did society not function before the state started printing worthless pieces of paper whose value wasn't guaranteed by gold? Oh wait, it did.


Radical idea: don't grow the apple if you know it's ROI is lower than ROI of some other project. Invest in that other project instead.


Even if, so what? Fund babies also make more money not doing anything than spending their money on growing apples. If people starve, the demand for apples will grow. And with demand its value. And with value the motivation to grow and sell apples.


No it isn't. Gold was outcompeted due to how difficult it is to store it safely without being stolen. It's heavy. 
From what you're saying one would think that humanity before 20th century lived in anarchy.

Why though? Why is it desirable to maintain the fiat price of the apple? Why is maintaining the constant fiat price of an apple more important than maintaining the actual value of fiat itself?

What do you mean the value must come from somewhere? The value comes from supply and demand. But how is it related to fiat?

Why not?
