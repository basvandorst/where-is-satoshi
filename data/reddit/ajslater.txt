There seems to be a DogeCoin wallet in the app store.

No, they had a web view and redirected the web view to provide very different functionality then they initially specified.
Functionality that should definitely be allowed, mind you. And may indeed be allowed in CoinJar's case, but I can see why it may have triggered their yoinking. It bears a striking resemblance to a real security problem.

Apparently BlockChain.info deceived the app store:
Can anyone from Australia confirm that the CoinJar app works?

It's just signaling affiliation with a subculture. Gay men in non English speaking countries have different accents to signal themselves. Obviously not all gay men or even most gay men adopt the 'gay lisp'.
What's odd is that there isn't really a lesbian accent.
Search for 'gay lisp' for more.

Find the average life expectancy. Add it to the birth date of your favorite professional futurist. Notice how many of their predictions occur on or around this date.

That's exactly how many years out we were in the 1960's when people started saying stuff like that.

If you're a technical analyst you might think that indicates some stability at this higher price. If you're not, nothing.

Perhaps you're both correct and its two whales in the same social network. People on the edge of an investment are often pushed over by their friends making the same investment.
