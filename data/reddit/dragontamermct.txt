This fundamentally isn’t true.

So just like real life predatory currency exchange then!

How it feels to have considered getting in BTC when it hit $300. Then when it hit 1k.
And then burying your head in a pillow when you didn’t. 
On the upshot, I found an old wallet with $30 worth in it. Yay. I’m gonna be rich when BTC hits 1m /s
Oh well. I enjoy this rollercoaster regardless

This seems like the kind of thing you wouldn’t want to admit in public on the internet.

"Did you have government permission to put your package inside an box so no one could see inside it?"

Well if you're serious, then you're a bit of a dumbass... But since you're not, everyone downvoting you is a little butthurt and is ignoring what gave bitcoin a pretty big start.

Come to think of it, that's probably one of the main reasons, it's accessible to literally anyone that can see (poor blind people :/ )

I agree. But then again, it is pretty interesting watching this unfold. Tomorrow is going to be an interesting news day. 
I wonder how many times internet censorship bills will be mentioned. and hacking groups like "le-anoonymouse"

Probably a reason it has 5/10 stars. Takes a fuckin lot to get less than 6 on imdb.

north korea! 
Or some random country in africa. Maybe some of the more radical islamic states.

Really? I dismiss most TV ads as either shady companies or some middle of the road product... The really high end stuff usually doesn't run ads... at least that I've seen.

Apple is a novelty, like any pre-built PC you can buy in a walmart, not high end. 
Apple computers look nice, and their OS is pretty fun, but as a computer, they're eh. 
Same for their phones, plenty of faster ones, better ones, but you're paying for the name, and, let's be honest, the appstore. 
I didn't say that no high-end products advertize, it's just rare, since high-end products are usually pretty niche, and expensive. Not really the kind of thing you want to advertize to a broad audience. 
I don't think most people would be too enthused by a R9 290X tv ad

Tbf this is the first and only reddit result when you google "Blocksize debate forces people to Ethereum"

National debt doesn’t really work like that though, it isn’t like your personal debt

The money isn’t going to crack, just like your synthetic fiber shirts/coats aren’t going to crack, lol.

In the US, it’s literally written on the money. 
Well sort of, the implication is.

And lots of really bad shit has happened because uneducated people didn't understand the topic at hand but thought they knew best. 
It cuts both ways. The voice of the populous is usually one you should listen to, but if the populous tells you "don't plug the hole in the boat, that's just what those snooty elite captains and engineers are telling us to do! They're out of touch with us crew hands!" sometimes it's best to listen to educated opinion. 
Of course not everything is that black and white... 
But going "Anything we don't understand or can't be easily broken down to be digested by a simpleton is bad!" is probably just as dangerous if not more dangerous.

If it was disease free, probably.

Some people have all the luck...
On an unrelated note, the pictures for the trending now section are a bit... odd...

sorry \^\^; I didn't know, I also don't spend a lot of time around this sub
