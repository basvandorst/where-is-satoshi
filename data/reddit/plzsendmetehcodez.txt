Ah yes. And the Lehman certificates that suddenly became worthless destroying the pensions of thousands who had been "safeguarded" by the oh-so-well-regulated banks.
Mr Srinivasan, I'm afraid that your argument is based on false premises and misleading statements.

I will describe my solution for a secure backup of wallet.dat. I use TrueCrypt and Dropbox for that.
First of all, letting the bitcoin client's -datadir point to a TrueCrypt container directly is not a good idea because of the size of the block chain, especially when backing the file up to Dropbox (free Dropbox accounts are limited to 2 GB). So it's better to keep only the wallet.dat file in the TrueCrypt container. Do NOT store unencrypted wallet.dat files in your Dropbox.
Second, I strongly recommend to move the datadir away from its default location (e.g. Documents and Settings on XP) as this is the place trojans will be looking for it. More intelligent trojans will perhaps be able to find wallet.dat anywhere, so you still have to be careful.
To move your datadir to, e.g. F:\Program Files\Bitcoin, follow these steps:
* Make a backup of everything and keep it safe!
* Create the new folder.
* Stop the Bitcoin client if it is running.
* Program links: Set the Bitcoin link target in the Autostart folder and the link in the Bitcoin folder to: C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin.exe  -datadir=F:\Program Files\Bitcoin
(use your own paths if different, store the previous target in e. g. Notepad in case you want to restore it)
* Start the Bitcoin client and watch the target folder in Explorer. You should see a newly created Bitcoin database along with a new wallet.dat. Your balance should be empty. If this does not work, DO NOT PROCEED.
* Stop the Bitcoin client.
* Delete the folder F:\Program Files\Bitcoin.
* Create a new folder F:\Program Files\Bitcoin.
* Copy the content of your old datadir (from e.g. Documents and Settings) to this folder. This will take some time if there are many downloaded blocks.
* Start the Bitcoin client. You should see your old balance.
You have now moved your datadir. You can delete your old datadir (and you should do so) after verifying that the Bitcoin client now uses the new folder. First rename the old folder and reboot the machine. Check for error messages. Double check the timestamps to verify that only the new folder gets used. Before doing anything with the folders, stop your Bitcoin client and restart it afterwards. Finally, move the old folder to the Recycle Bin. If you are absolutely sure that the Bitcoin client now uses only the new folder both at reboot and when started manually, you can delete the folder from the Recycle Bin or undelete it and do a safe delete with the utility of your choice. MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A BACKUP in case something goes wrong.
To set up the encryption and backup, create a TrueCrypt container of about 1 MB size in the directory of your choice (E:\My Dropbox\Private\Important\bitcoins.tc in this example). I use a Dropbox folder for automatic backup but this is optional.
You don't want to keep this TrueCrypt container mounted all the time. Having it mounted prevents the Dropbox client from synchronizing it. I copy the wallet.dat file to the TrueCrypt container when I shut down my laptop (I usually use the stand by mode). To automate the process I have created the following batch file on my Desktop:
	 off
	
	:trybackup
	
	rem Save Bitcoin Wallet
	call "F:\Program Files\Bitcoin\walletbackup.bat"
	
	if errorlevel 1 goto trybackup
	
	rem Standby
	echo Shutdown...
	%systemroot%\System32\rundll32.exe powrprof.dll,SetSuspendState
When I double click this file it makes a backup and goes to standby automatically. Dropbox synchronizes the TrueCrypt container when I start the PC again.
In F:\Program Files\Bitcoin I have put the file walletbackup.bat:
	 off
	echo Bitcoin Wallet Backup to TrueCrypt container in progress...
	
	set tc=C:\Program Files\TrueCrypt\TrueCrypt.exe
	
	rem Check whether correct drive is already mounted
	if exist M:\wallet.dat goto copy
	
	rem Truecrypt: Mount
	%tc% /q /c /v "E:\My Dropbox\Private\Important\bitcoins.tc" /l M /m timestamp
	
	if errorlevel 1 goto error
	
	:copy
	rem Backup
	copy "F:\Program Files\Bitcoin\wallet.dat" M:\
	if errorlevel 1 goto error
	
	rem TrueCrypt: Dismount
	%tc% /d M /q /s
	
	goto end
	
	:error
	echo Error!
	exit /b 1
	
	:end
Of course you have to adjust the paths. Make sure that you understand everything about these scripts before you run them.
Though I find this solution to be rather cumbersome, it seems to work well in practice. If you notice any errors please say so.

That's right. The frozen amount may be as high as it is due to the fact that a lot of money has been funneled out of the Cyprus bank system in the recent weeks, even though this was supposed to be prohibited.
Looks to me like this time it's a game of the "middle rich" bailing out the very wealthy. Glad that it's not the lowly EU tax payer, as usual.

I think you should not hate Bitcoin because of this. That would be like the dog hating the newspaper instead of the hand striking him with it.
First of all, Bitcoin mining with even high end gaming PCs is not going to be profitable as there are ASICs now that are much faster and consume less power. So, these are probably people mining some altcoins, not Bitcoin.
Second, if your supplier of choice can't supply what you need, why don't you order your stuff elsewhere? Surely the culprits can't order from everywhere... also, there are plenty of shops based in Hong Kong/China who will ship pretty much anywhere in the world (see, for example, 
I'm afraid you can't stop this practice though. But I'm sure you can find a way to get what you want. Good luck with your medical procedures, and please don't get worked up too much.

I work in IT. Some day I had an interesting conversation with a coworker who worked on a project of a big bank (I won't disclose which one, but it's one of the largest banks in one of the financially most advanced countries).
He told me what happens when you "wire" some money. As soon as you push the transfer button the money from your account is locked and becomes part of a miraculous worldwide flux of money which is instantly transferred to where it gains interest. Within a matter of seconds the bank will send it to anybody who needs a short-term loan (mostly other banks, and by short-term I really mean short-term; these loans can mature within minutes or maybe seconds only). By keeping all transferred money for hours or maybe days in this sort of financial limbo the banks can make a handsome profit off your money (which isn't technically "yours" any more because at the instant you pushed the button you "transferred" it). If you think about the sums being transferred at any given point in time: the profits are huge.
My coworker told me that the bank was working on a giant computer system to optimize these kinds of money flows. He also told me that the cost of development was running into hundreds of millions. But the bank didn't care. They reckoned that once they would get this system running they'd recover the development cost within a few weeks.
tl;dr: Banks have an interest not to transfer money too quickly, because they profit from it.

Wow, there's so much FUD going on in this case. Lots of people getting worked up. What's your agenda here, anyway?
I had (and still have) €92 sitting at Bitcoin-24 when it was closed down. I had purchased BTC there and I wasn't ripped off, and to this day I believe that if the account wouldn't have been locked my money would have been safe. I simply don't buy into this whole fraud thing. It makes no sense.
Now, what's happening? People sue Mr Hausdorf over fraud because they feel cheated because his account has been closed and the money seized? Hello, anybody sane still out there? What good do you think this is doing anybody? IMO the prosecution should have never become active without any concrete claims of fraudulent activities, of which I have not seen any proof, nowhere.
If I'm going to sue anybody it's the offending bank and the prosecution office for disturbing legit business activities. I hope Mr Hausdorf gets out of this mess again.

This is a correct decision IMHO.
The EU is demanding a share from the shareholders for bailing out the banks. That's all. Not to mention that most of the money lying in Cyprus is said to be black or laundered money belonging to Russian economic criminals. Why should the rest of EU tax payers rescue filthy-rich Russian mafia types without demanding a fair share?
I believe that if Cyprus had consented to stronger financial market regulation and controls it might have been a different matter. But this has actually nothing to do with robbery at all.

Well, what's the alternative? Your bank goes bust and maybe six, seven years later you get, perhaps 2% of your money back? Dude, it's hard for you personally, but there have been lots of bank failures in history. Just a lesson not to keep all your eggs in one nest.
Feeling sorry for you though...

1. Couldn't you tie the transaction limit to the exchange rate and say, transactions less than $5 are not accepted? Or maybe charge a fixed rate that makes small change trading unprofitable.
2. As far as I understand, the problems were created by trading bots. Maybe it's just a little early for Mt Gox to allow fully automated unrestricted trading, perhaps you should disable this function when there is high load?
(these approaches have their problems, I know...)
