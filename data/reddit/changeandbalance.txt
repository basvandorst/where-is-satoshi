- Decide on a small amount of money that you can throw away
- Invest that money, consider it a lotto ticket (unlikely to pay off, but fun to hold)
- DO NOT TOUCH IT for a set amount of time you decide on ahead of time. Otherwise, you will panic with the news cycles.

I can't understand if those upvoting you just don't know how the internet works, or just didn't read what you said, or what, but if you have an ISP that 'only serves a few streets' - that is a big LAN party. 
I'm sure that worked fine in Romania (a country only building it's internet userbase now, and only sitting at 50% of the pop with an internet connection), but do you honestly think people in the US will drop their huge ISP for a local 'few streets' network? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:13:29
And this is why I'm glad I dropped big banks years ago when they were trying to charge a monthly fee for a basic debit card.
My credit union pays ME at the end of the year instead, and I have all the cheap loans I could need. 
Seriously make it a small project to switch over if you're still with BoA. You'll get a good feeling every time you see them doing something dumb in the news.

"retroactive justice for dead people" = useless
"Oh sorry your dad is dead, here's a random monetary value we assigned to that."
Here's the point: your thought experiments fall apart in the real world. Learn to use more than 1 tool in the society-building toolkit, or show proof of a free-market utopia in action

do you not understand that ISPs could unilaterally control bitcoin if net neutrality is destroyed?
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:29:31
Well, comparing any taxation to being robbed at gun point seems overly simplistic and childish to me. So any conclusion you derive from that analogy would be useless. As I told the other commenter, you likely benefit from the collectively-bought infrastructure that taxes paid for. You get roads, schools, drinkable water, safe sewage disposal, telephone, electric, and internet cables - run to your home by the government. 
If you're going to turn around and tell me you could have bought all of that cheaper on the free market by yourself without grouping with others to bargain, I'm going to say you don't know shit about economics.
Grow up about the fucking taxes. I'd hate to think of the shitty behavior you could rationalize with that simple analogy.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:45:13
right, because the cost of entering the ISP space is INSANE.
Everyone here is pretending like barrier to entry to ISP market is low, when it's insanely high and the existing ones we have did so with government help

If didn't do much research outside of my state. Most states have a few credit unions, and I just looked for one with an office near me.

Yes, they could block bitcoin traffic so that only those who get internet via satellite could access it. 
No, others will not easily compete with existing ISPs. Existing ISPs are successfully bullying GOOGLE out of fiber, so don't believe anyone who tells you your neighbor will start up an ISP to save you. Our tax-payer money got our existing ISPs to where they are now. 
I'm calling reps again tomorrow about it

No one said the universe owed them anything. But unless you're living in a forest typing your comments from a laptop powered by flowers and connected to the internet with love, YOU ALSO PREFER THOSE THINGS. 
Therefore, we should now move on to talk about the best way to achieve them. Every first world country I see is using a mixed economy. Where is your free market economy that has achieved similar results? Why aren't you living there? 
Or is the entire fucking fantasy all in your simplistic head? A head which contains a mind which says things like "being robbed at gun point and paying taxes are functionally the same".
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:02:05
Nope, we should create regulations to create guidelines for products that want to use known dangerous chemicals or known dangerous practices to protect citizens and create societal stability. 
Nice strawman though.
Or perhaps you'd be fine with lead in your gasoline tomorrow? If someone goes crazy from being exposed to the fumes and murders you, I'm sure they'll settle all that in court. And think of the poor gasoline companies who can't put a product on the leaded gasoline market due to all the evil regulations! No?
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:28:32
no, because of the insanely prohibitive cost of laying enough underground cable to run your own ISP.
Would you also suggest we deregulate the electrical grid? Then what, you'd build your own?

There's a limit to this, I think.
If I have tons of money so I lobby the government to make a law to create a tax loophole that benefits me and my friends, do I deserve kudos or condemnation?

In armed robbery the robber is taking something from you. You are given nothing back.
In a government system paid for by taxes, literally everything you have based your life on is paid for by the 'robber'. The breadth of the things you have taken for granted is staggering if you are willing to say you actually see zero functional difference between giving your money to the government vs. giving it to a random robber on the street. Are you saying that?
I thought honestly that your initial analogy was an off-the-cuff exaggeration for effect. I am beyond shocked you're choosing to argue in it's defense. 
edit: and of course you're ignored the "Where is your free market economy that has achieved similar results?" question, because bothering with finding evidence for ideas is too time consuming?
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:19:59
We had net nuetrality during that time. The business owners weren't acting freely, they were getting smacked down from the FCC when AT&amp;T tried to sabotage Skype for instance. 
Do you know anything about the real world? It's not a dichotomy. We have laws and regulations everywhere, not just N. Korea. 
You want lead gas, child labor, and internet provider cartels that choose what you can see online? THEN YOU MOVE.

Cool, point to a sustained real world example of your theory in action. Cause everywhere I look first world countries use well-enforced regulations to deal with this, and everyone else gets to swim in oily shit water. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:29:30
No, but collective buying power is a thing and governments are a common way of doing that. 
I know independent types love bitcoin but let's not pretend the most efficient way to do everything is on your own. Regardless, 'why even have taxes?' is pretty far from the topic I was commenting on.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:11:50


I mean, it hasn't so far. I'll say the same thing to you I say to everyone who paints an overtly-simplistic capitalism fairly tale: show me a pure free market utopia in action. Which country is doing it? How come all the first world countries I see are using mixed economies?
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:16:33
As I understand it, you still have to run cable from the city's backbone to the individual houses you want to serve in the case of high-speed internet. It's referred to as the 'last mile problem'. Correct me if I'm wrong.

None of those are a crypto forked off of another crypto with a smiliar name on a domain with the original crypto's name. Bitcoin Cash does not have the same type of supporters or incentives as original bitcoin.
Original bitcoin is bitcoin. Don't start with 'true' coin shit because that can go anywhere see: No True Scotsman

Agree totally. Was there manipulation going on? The first few commentors / voters in the thread seemed insane. I hope the internet has not forgotten the importance of net neutrality so soon.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:21:53
No, because pure free market capitalism hasn't delivered the utopia that idiots like you talk about in hundreds of years of human civilization. We have a thing called a mixed economy, look it up.
The world isn't black and white. Learn to evaluate things individually. Sometimes the government is in the way, sometimes the government is a useful tool to be wielded by the consumer to ensure that industries with high barrier to entry (ISP) or industries with huge information deficits on the consumer side (healthcare) are under control. 
Governments aren't the only tyrant game going.

Because pollution isn't localized to the property owner? Air pollution travels, as does water pollution. This only works if property own suffers full cost of polluting himself. Otherwise, capitalistic forces DO NOT DEAL with long-term of environment impacts.
This is basic.

"First world countries give a shit, shit holes don’t." - is too simplistic to be considered accurate. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:56:11
That may be your theory but in practice common-law DOES NOT address costly impacts of pollution on normal citizens, especially in the case of long-term damage to health. 
If you want my opinion on why the theory fails: it shifts too much responsibility to normal bystanders to research, track, and prove the negative effects of pollutants. Those seeking to bring products into the market containing dangerous chemicals need to do that work first, not wait for common-law collateral damage to get retroactive justice for dead people.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:26:59


Where is your source? 
My quick googling indicates that they are slowing expansion [because it is "hellishly expensive" to lay fiber cables]( Demand through the roof.
In other words, insanely high barrier of entry to a market that existing competitors reached with government (tax-payer) help.

He was convinced by the bankers it was a good idea. Just like lobbyists sneak around the halls of the whitehouse today whispering bullshit in our lawmakers ears. A legion of wormtongues speaking sweet lies to a handful of fat, insulated legislators so that the ruling class can keep its comfort.
