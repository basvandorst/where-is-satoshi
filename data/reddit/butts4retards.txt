Dear random visitor, please ignore all the bitcoin posts, it's just a bunch of greedy pig losers trying to make you a greater fool in their pyramid. They are really desperate right now, cause bitcoin is down over 70% in just a few months, so they need to scam more people fast before their scheme completely collapses. They are all losing huge amounts of money, and want you to join on their misery. Just ignore them, and let them hold the hot potato till it burns their hands for good ;) Happy I could help you stay away from yet another scam!

You're a genious. Great plan, you should write a book! You know, half drama, half unintended comedy :D

Congratulations, you just found out why buttcoin is completely useless, unless you're a cult member willing to lose money on each transaction in order to pump your pyramid.
