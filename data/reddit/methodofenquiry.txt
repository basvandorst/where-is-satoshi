As I said " but of course this isn't true" because of course you are correct.
Do you have an answer to my post and question or are you only here to correct my mistake that I already apolgize for?

Does this mean if I do not have an account yet I have Bitcoin that I can receive Euros?
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:09:39
How is this helping get cash?  Is there something I don't understand?
@_date: 2017-09-26 10:01:15
Then you also will want to know how to exchange Bitcoin for cash. :)
@_date: 2017-09-26 01:04:15
I don't think you read what I asked.  Localbitcoin requires that I stay in one place and have an address.  I am traveling.
Mycelium marketplace is something I don't even know what it is.
The bank acccount does not help.  I will be traveling so can not go back to UK to get cash every time I want to buy a dinner.

Are you sure this doesn't exist?  There must be a way I think.
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:07:07
What other thing would an ATM give?  I think this is the only thing that an ATM can do?
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:20:53
Yes.  Okay I will change it.  I guess I just think of everyone except UK uses Euros but of course this isn't true.

What advantage?  I am a cash person totally.  Why make backways progress?
@_date: 2017-09-27 05:56:35
I was looking at localbitcoins.com.  How does this help me get cash?  I see it as getting money into a bank account.  That is not what I am asking for.  What I want is to get cash when I travel.
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:08:56
Can you tell me anything for mycelium marketplace?  I did search but am getting confused.
@_date: 2017-09-27 04:47:50
Oh!  I thought the way it works is that people mail you cash.  Is that wrong?
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:38:19
Brilliant.  Thank you.
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:38:39
Now I am seeing many of these ATM machines only allow you to *enter* cash and you *receive* Bitcoin.  I want the opposite way.
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:58:06
Something P2P?
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:19:27
Do you have an answer to the question that I asked?  I was not here for other opinions on how many advantages the system has.
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:49:19


That is okay.
Oh I see that you also are the person who responded in the other comment.  Yes you gave suggestions but none of the suggestions are about my question.  It seems you want to convince me to do something that is not what I asked about.
I am asking how to exchange Bitcoin for cash.  I am not asking how to get an ATM card from my bank.  I do not want one.  I am not asking for your opinion on if I have a good question.  Only how I can travel using Bitcoin in some way that I can use cash to buy things.
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:37:12
I am asking how to do this with Bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2017-09-26 01:02:08
As said in post I am wanting cash.  Not a card.
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:04:36
Okay.  I looked online but did not see any people who will meet in person but maybe that is just bad luck today and I keep checking.
Thank you for this information.
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:11:18
I like this idea so much.  Already it is making my travel plans more interesting.
@_date: 2017-09-27 04:53:42


Can you explain this for me?  I don't have Android.  But if this is a good idea I can get one!


Why does this not work in Germany?  Legal or technical reason?
@_date: 2017-09-26 07:48:37
That's a nice idea.  Are these very common on the mainland now?
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:21:23
I can't change title.  But everyone understands the question I think.
