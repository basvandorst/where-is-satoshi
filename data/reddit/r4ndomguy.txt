If you live in the us it might be true. Other than that bitcoin at its current stage isnt spread well enough (for what i would use it), not steady enough and finally there is the problem of educating people. Example: Why should i stop using my already in place paypal account, that has access to everything and get through a whole lot of timeconsuming steps to be able to use a payment, that has to ME no other difference than the one i am using now?
In other words, at the current state bitcoin especially in other countries than usa is more of a enthousiastic thing, not something benefitial.

i am quite a believer in bitcoin, but i do 100% agree that you get down/upvotes depending on how you flow with the trend in the whole reddit community. 
(I even posted a thread on reddit, wich was instantly downvoated. After 2 weeks someone else posted the same thing and got many upvotes. in another @_date: 2014-02-26 12:26:18

I wouldnt suggest you to buy right now. Wait till the downtrend ends and buy, if the trend breakes and the price jumps up. You will loose some of your potential money, but you wont have much risk. Because currently it is still falling...

if i see how more and more accessable bitcoin gets, there are 2 outcomes that i see. Either it will go up in price heavily as everyone wants to have some for the "lolz". (and after some years propably there will be a better coin that gets big and bitcoin will fall)
Or the bitcoin bubble will plop and bitcoin will fall.
(I believe in the first outcome)

it is shut down as far as i know, as mt gox has closed every trading possible

there where 10000 of frauds, moneyprinting and such, but it never destroyed money as such. If bitcoin manages to be big enough and it is pretty big even now, i believe it wont matter. And i dont believe, that there will be a hack or whatever this big, that it destroys bitcoins, ir at least it wont be used, as the hacker makes 0 profit 
I however do believe, that another coin might be replacing bitcoin (rather slow) in the future.
