I really enjoy it.  Heard just about every episode.

I don't know what you mean by, "mean" but I'm a bitcoin spender and promoter.  Lastly I'm a cautious investor.  I just hope they provide a rounded thought out perspective to their audience.

They both commented that using Bitcoin was much easier than they expected.  It was a win for Pizza and BTC on Friday.

I've used this method a couple of times now.  It's a clean, interesting way to store BTC and with the tamper evident stickers it's less attractive to would-be thieves that are close to you.  We keep ours in a small coded safe.

I never actually thought of using these paper wallets as currency. I don't think I would. 
I printed two for my kids 11 &amp; 13. They each got 1 BTC and their own wallet. We had a great conversation about how this currency works and what it means to have a Bitcoin wallet. We installed an app on their iPods so they can track the value and see it (hopefully) grow. We talked about ways they can earn more BTC for doing chores. 
The real payoff was when I heard my oldest explaining to her cousin how special Bitcoin is over regular money and compared it to gold. She clearly gets it and now so does her cousin who until tonight had never heard of Bitcoin.

Thank You! That's so cool! Long story, but my wallet client cache got messed up and I have to resync. The transfers are pending.

Thanks again, I spilt the tip between the kiddo's.  They're stoked.

Remember when you tried to kill me twice? Oh how we laughed and laughed, except I wasn't laughing...
