Wow, well said. I agree. Having actual control of your currency and the decentralized nature are why its the future.

If BTC fails so does BCH. It's so clear that the success of crypto depends on perception, BTC must do well for all others to grow and become strong, both versions can and must exist.

A few things. Ether can have some major upside but keep in mind it's about what the market cap is and potential. So if eth is 30 billion right now and btc is 90 billion that means that eth even at btc levels will only be around $900 a coin. Lastly its about brand name and development teams, research is key. It is still very early, don't feel like you missed anything.

As a person that got into bitcoin pretty recently I would guess this is due to so many getting interested, just like me, very recently. I think this is a good sign, more people means more money and higher market cap. Of course if you are glass half empty you could say it's bots. I prefer thinking this is all a good sign for the moon and hodling. I really have been reading a lot on r/bitcoin, clearly... haha

I'm still pretty young, 34, but being in the working world for over 10 years and doing fairly well in big and small companies I can tell you its all politics. Meaning its all about the people, the more people the better in almost any economic model. You need the bottom and the top. Its economics, social, business --- everything
A neat video I found recently explaining economics that just helped confirm my suspicions can be found here: 
Keep learning! Don't end up on the bottom, most people who don't learn and understand are the ones that end up there.
