Cmon man, if gmail died email would go on because email is a protocol.  Bitcoin the protocol will have hundreds of millions of dollars of vc capital  flow in this year alone (over 30 mil last year).  It is 1995 right now.

LOL, we have never had a deflationary currency before genius.  The last 1000 years of human history prove why fiat is a BAD IDEA, and governments having full control over the sovereign currency get corrupted and enslave their people TIME AND TIME AGAIN THROUGHOUT HISTORY.  Do some research before spouting complete nonsense.

Absolutely terribly written, literally did almost no research at all.  Time to break down her claims:
Bitcoin is not fully anonymous at all.  The greatest vehicle for money laundering  is and has always been cold hard cash.
Bitcoin servers farms can take same green initiatives as web farms and be powered by thermal energy and cooled by being in greenland, ect...
NSA does not tab web cameras of average people, it has never been proven that they do this at all.
Like the internet, adoption will come in time, only this time unlike the internet, there is a financial incentive for regular people to get in early this time.  Ever read coindesk.com?  You should, as new vendors and merchants that accept bitcoin get announced daily.
Not only is it more useful then current currencies, but it is far more efficient.  Try to send fifty cents to another country, can't do it, how about $100?  Takes days and is littered with fees, but like the internet made hollywood video and phone companies and news papers irrelevant, so too will it make central banks and money transmission services irrelevant.

You guys have to understand, any money in any centralized banking institution is not YOUR money.  If you read the fine print of banks it clearly states they can do whatever they want with any amount of money in their banks.  These people are criminals of the worst kind, who do business with criminals of the worst kind.  I'm hoping bitcoin can be a nice counter balance to this world of centralized banking cartels run a muck.

Why would someone use email instead of letters?  It's pointless...

Might want to give coindesk.com a read.  Every day someone new announces bitcoin adoption.  Also there is gyft.com which lets you shop at nation wide stores.

I believe it's just a copper coin you can buy on ebay, no real value.  But still rather cool to see boss embrace bitcoin.  I believe he now owns some actual bitcoin.

Might want to give coindesk.com a read, every day someone new announces bitcoin adoption.  Not to mention gyft.com allowing you to shop at business nation wide.
