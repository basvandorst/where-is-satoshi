Holocaust or not. Does it really matter now? Whats going on in Syria, Yemen and the ethnic cleansing of Rohingayas in Myanmar is a lot worse than that. And the worst part of it is, this is all happening now and you are still dwelling in the past.

So you do stand for all the evil that I mentioned above? I'm absolutely appalled. Shame on you and your parents who gave birth to you.

Yes he recognizes the threat bitcoin poses to the banks and acknowledges the short comings of banks. But that dosent mean his war mongering that is bombing kindergarten schools, killing pregnant women destroying people's houses and evicting them to allow settlers to build colonies on illegal land, corruption, extortion, murder etc cannot be overlooked. I'm sick of people downvoting who ever that says anything against this monster. If this is what the bitcoin community stands for then please exclude me from it.

Dash is not that decentralized. And it is was premined too

I hate Infowars. But pretty surprised they wanted to listen to what McAfee had to say.

No doubt this guy is corrupt to the core but like all politicians he knows how to get applause. And probably behind the scenes he is evaluating on how to counter bitcoin to keep the banks alive.

I don't hate any religion or any particular group. I just dislike criminals, murders, thief's, war mongers, rapists. If you fit that description or anyone you support fits that description then I wish you the worst of consequences. I'm sure every sane person agrees with me. If you dont than god help you. Peace✌

I think that's even easier. Just wrap yourself in burka and walk like a ninja to the border.

If you think BTC is too volatile you haven't seen nothing yet. The other coins are BTC volatility times 2 at the least.

Listen lady there are a lot of things you learn about yourself in the bedroom. And all of these may not be to everybody's liking. That's why you keep these things PRIVATE. Do you ever find straight people expressing their preference of partner in public? Like I don't go out in public and say out loud that I'm into a specific kind of a man or woman and enjoy certain things. And the article you are linking doesn't mention you. So there is no way to verify the authenticity of your story.

Offcourse I can route all transactions through a centralized server and achieve more than a million transactions per second. That's kind of what dash is. Not that decentralized. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 10:47:15
Yeah right make a living out of playing victim. Just get a job. Nobody cares what you prefer in the bedroom if you keep it to yourself. But that's where the problem lies. You don't want to keep it to yourself do you? In this this case you're being political and you probably deserve the heat.

Jew hating? I never said anything about any religion. So criticising Natanyahu equals hating Jews? Nice logic you got there.

I'd assume your Dave coin brings nothing to the table. Unlike Bitcoin which is a trustless immutable decentralized P2P currency maintained by thousands of nodes spread across the globe validating transactions continuesly.

He may have his reasons. Since it seems he knows what he is doing it would be better for you to respect his choice and keep an open mind and not be a partisan.

Cool story bro

It's not scarce at all. You can even own a 1/100th of it or even less. You don't necessarily have to have a whole number.

Just Google for a Bitcoin ATM in Saudi. You might find.

I should have panic sold at 11k like them. Could have bought double the coins later with the same amount.

Another shit post
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:39:05
We need more core devs working on Bitcoin. After transaction speed and scaling next up on the agenda should be a better consensus method than POW.

How did you manage to post with negative karma?
