I genuinely refuse to believe he didn’t have any bitcoins before this.

There’s a name for the phenomenon - that when we see the media talk about things we know we see all their flaws but when we are unsure of the topic we take what they say as fact. I forget the name. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:46:05
How is this a troll? I’m genuinely curious what you guys think of this solution. 
This is the CEO of Blockstream, a fairly important player in Bitcoin to say the least. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:21:10
Wouldn't that be where bitpay comes in in this instance?

I think even something like TAILS with a persistant drive would work. It boots entirely off the flash drive so nothing is left on the computer. If an emergency happens the user can hold the power button on the laptop to automatically power it off thus relocking the drive.
TAILS uses LUKS encryption on the persistant volume, but you can add TrueCrypt and whatever else you want via persistance

Now if it would be released on F-Droid that would be great.

Listen, I'm insanely anti-regulation about bitcoin and everything. Look at my post history and you'll see a ton of and posts. 
This change in the law IS a good thing for California. They effectively removed the clause from their current law that said that the only legally recognized currency is the US dollar.
So, as an ancap, I reluctantly say this is actually a good thing.

At what point does self defense stop extending to one's neighbor in the NAP?
That being said, assassination markets do not accomplish the goal of spreading the ideas of liberty which are much more importatnt than the elimination of a figure head. If the ideas are spread, the figure head becomes irrelevent, but if they are not, the figure head becomes replaced.

I can confirm that this works.
I have a recurring buy set up to $50 USD worth of bitcoins every other week (in sync with my paychecks) 
It's not EXACTLY $50 USD every time so if you're watching every penny be sure to double check. It seems it determines the buy at one price then it does it at the next price refresh. I've had anywhere from 49.50 to 50.65 auto withdrawn.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:58:49
Fair enough, there are alternatives, I was merely using it as an example because it is well known. 
You may put any binary on your persistant drive and run it as you wish with TAILS.
@_date: 2014-10-12 16:54:13
Raspi can't boot without closed source drivers.
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:23:54
Why exactly would this be bad?
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:53:58
And that is what we call fragmentation.

Hexchat is free, open source, and cross-platform.
That is the client you should be using.
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:58:04
Yes you already helped! Half my order has shipped :P
You've done good!
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:47:33
7.1a is still being audited and secure as far as everyone knows.
I was only using it as an example though.
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:50:50
Yes, this 100% can.
The 2FA keys are stored in a database /data/data/com.google.authenticator2/databases/database (something very similar to that). They can be copied from one phone to another with 0 effort then that phone will have the same 2FA pins as the original.
Source: I have done exactly this in migrating from one phone to another. 
Note: Both phones will function as expected with the 2FA and there is no sign that the keys are on multiple devices.
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:52:34
Order still untrackable
I'm going to try their Live Chat support since the phone support isn't helping :/

Who designed this site.....
@_date: 2014-10-20 01:17:23
possible shadowban
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:34:06
I guess I'll get bitpay on the phone to make sure.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:55:51
~~This will remove the Persistant drive, but all active processes are in the RAM, so if you had a bitcoin wallet or a keepass database open, it would stay decrypted in the RAM.~~
Yes, this is a good solution too. I just tested it and removing the USB drive automatically shuts TAILS down and wipes the RAM

How will Mail-In-Rebates work?
I just bought a [this]( which has a $10 MIR.
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:52:14
Yep, it works properly now! Thank you.
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:20:56
This is actually a good thing.
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:25:09
I'll do this now. Hopefully I'll get someone that knows what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2014-04-17 15:33:48
 Looks like 
    onclick="trackOutboundLink(' return false;"
is why it's being blocked... come on
Can confirm they don't work for me in Firefox + Disconnet + AdBlock Edge.
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:19:05
I ran into problems too:
You can see them here:
Since then I've contacted them a few times and they say that a supervisor will be contacting me via email in the next 24 hours. 
My order is listed as "Pending B2B OA Process - This order is a New Business Account, your application is in process."
On Friday, I was told it'd be shipped Monday. It's monday at 5PM EST and no word on shipping. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:39:21
The person they transfered me to said the order has been confirmed and will ship monday then hang up...
@_date: 2014-06-29 21:22:16
This is removing a regulation that previously existed. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 15:19:25
Is always this... I'm not even sure how to say it.
I'm probably quite biased, being a huge advocate of FOSS software, but how can security minded people bash FOSS software so much in favor of proprietary software. 
That entire thread seems to be them circlejerking about how the FSF endorced Replicant is trying to prove proprietary software is evil with scare tactics.
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:38:02
Their customer serive reps should have SOME sort of training. Even if it's "if you hear the word bitcoin say 'we're waiting on bitpay, I apologize for your inconvenience'"
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:30:10
Second representitive: "have you contacted bitcoin?"
Me: "Bitcoin is a currency not a company, who would I contact?"
Him: "Let me transfer you to Bitcoin"
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:57:52


These sites hare rather strict no hitmen/poisons policies.
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:56:10
Would it be alright if I did the same?
 is my issue from a few days ago and it doesn't seem to have been resolved.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:21:15
I'm sure there are cases where this could happen but I'd assume someone could do such a thing in panic if needed.
@_date: 2014-01-25 01:05:44
Live Chat says payment has been processed and will ship Monday. If I don't get a confirmation email I'll call again.
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:01:50
Well, he's using outlook.com...
I see that as the weakness.
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:02:19
End users should use PGP. Even if the site gets compromised and the site was logging all addresses, they'll get an encrypted message rather than the actual address. 
There is no reason to trust the site to not store logs. All vendors worth a damn have PGP keys publicly available for this very reason
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:39:35
Bitpay seems to say that it's on the merchant to resolve such issues according to their recording when you call them. They say to email them if not.
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:51:06
Yep, I sent it to I really appreciate your help.
@_date: 2014-11-07 14:00:48
My point was the actual market keeping addresses. You have no choice but to trust the vendor with regards to receiving your address. 
You want to minimize points of failure, PGP eliminates the point of failure that is anyone but your vendor being able to intercept your address in transit. 
I haven't heard of the nuke password in LUKS, how do you set it up?
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:21:54
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:27:45
I saw the confirmation on the order page. Bitpay gives 15 minutes and the order did go through. I even checked the blockchain within 60 seconds and the order had gone through.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:42:37
I do agree with you. I'd like to have more failsafes in place and this as an absolute last resort.
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:32:01
We need an equivolent of for crap like this.
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:54:18
I tried but it seems no one has been able to reach Mr. Satoshi for years.
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:48:36
Yes, I'd hope anyone that truly relies on such a technology would do enough research on it to make an informed decision on whether or not they use it and not base their decision on some random guy's post on reddit.
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:03:24
Thank you for posting this. Mine came in today and I got slightly annoyed.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:45:03
Yes it does, I just tested it.
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:17:01
What are they going to do if the person they're going after unplugs his desktop before they can do this? or holds the poweroff button so his laptop does a hard shutdown?

I could see a bear market with some money going into alts and BTC no longer being at it's current 46% market share. I foresee BTC and ETH fighting for  for a while too.
I think the next bear market could linger around $2000/BTC though, I don't think we'll ever see sub $1000 levels again.
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:09:19
This is probably the top or damn close to. Start buying again in the incoming bear market
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:43:18
I'm in the same boat as you. I cashed out half my coins and am planning on rebuying on the next crash. I tripled the money I put into bitcoin and still have half my stash so I'm happy overall. I cashed out at 2350

The bitcoin hearing takes on an ENTIRELY different perspective if you listen from an anarchist point of view.
From the very first few words
"it's in the best interest of virtual currency providers to comply with these regulations"
