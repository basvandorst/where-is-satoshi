...Um.... what makes some fast talking people hard to understand is that they tend to add a lot of redundant words? /awkward
Like... no offense, sincerely hoping I can help you out here... If I summarise, your entire message is much shorter: "He's speaking fast possibly because he's in a presentation and it's in his personality to do so. I had a customer do the same and ask about my talking speed as if he was asking if I was on drugs. It was perplexing because I was trying to give them their money's worth while busy and multitasking and we did end up having a high level conversation. Why is that even strange? I can't just sit around, my job requires that I do like 10 things at a time, and I live in a fast paced city so it's not out of place for me to talk fast. Sorry for talking too fast and giving better service than most places. "
I've roughly shortened your message by 50% and it's essentially saying the same thing. In my country, people equate efficiency with being concise, not being fast.

Talking fast with padded speech doesn't say much about your explanation skills. Most people don't have problems with fast speakers, it's just those certain fast speakers who add a lot of redundant words. I can't even begin to count the number of redundant "basically" he said and slurred words in his speech (no offense to him, he's a very smart guy, but not the person who can give a speech, he's too nervous and some words aren't pronounced clearly).

I thought how bad can it be and clicked on it, and ended up watching at 0.75 speed. The normal speed is incredible.
