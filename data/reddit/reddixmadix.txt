Pretty moronic statement you have there.
Facebook is not promoting itself as "come here to sell drugs, I'll just take a small commission."
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:31:38
Again, no experiment here.
Silk Road users were not using code names, nor was any of the site's activity conducted without the knowledge of DPR. He even had guides and tutorials on how to sell illegal stuff.
I have yet to see either Facebook or Ebay issue a manual on how to conduct illegal activities.
Of course, it is perfectly reasonable to go after the people involved in the illegal activities. DPR was the third party involved in EVERY illegal activity conducted on Silk Road. Facebook has no idea if two friends decide to exchange pills in FB chat, but they use "books" as a code name.

Son, what are you talking about?
I pay $20 for unlimited data at 1gb transfer speeds ( not USA ). Last month I used 3tb of data. Match that with your silly experiment.

"Science of trans folks". That's not how people with mental illnesses work.
@_date: 2013-05-08 17:10:45
Just because you don't exactly know how something works, doesn't mean you consider it magic. That's a horribly ignorant thing to say.

I did nothing wrong. Stop trying to whitenight. A dude is a dude. And that is it.
On the other hand, you took a huge bite from a steaming pile of shit, which is my story, and enjoyed it so much, that you felt the need to reply. You know, so you can feel better about yourself.
I know someone on the internet that, and listen to this, that didn't stop for a redlight once. Do you want his contact so you can ask him if he wants you to address his mistake?

I just said God is the only answer. As a Christian, the one true religion, I am not required to read the New Testament.
Only non-believers and sinners should read the Holy Bible.

I am quite happy, thank you for worrying.
By the way, how did you mutilation go? Did you cut your dick yet? Do you feel like a girl? No? I guess we can't all be happy.
As for me, I just become a home owner, paid in advance. How many years will you have to slave for your "operation" to be paid in full? years and years? I bet that will make you sooooo happy.
In the end, you will feel like a Frankenstein's monster.

Look, [here]( the original, in case you need it.
Anyway, I'd leave my computer shield and go out and do all that, but where i live there are no god damn minorities.
So all I'm left with is the Internet.
All jokes aside, if i were living in the states, my banner would have to say "I hate white people" because as far as i hear, white people are the minority over there these days.
But seriously, what do you have against black people that you suggest me to go out and yell at them?
Are you a racist or some kind of asshole like that? Or worse?
@_date: 2013-10-09 00:57:52
Should i add more or less gay friends to the story?
I'm new to this "toh-lher-ance" thing, I am doing my best.
@_date: 2013-10-09 09:19:07
But they were not born with that ability.
So whatever they do, it's still more body modification.

I honestly don't believe your "science". God is the only answer.

Yep, you're pretty fucking stupid.
@_date: 2013-10-02 22:21:50


Are you fucking stupid?
Save their life how? Were they going to die?
Point is they were doing something illegal, so who the fuck cares if they get caught? I certainly wouldn't shed a tear for them.
Personally I'm glad that fucker is no longer safe.

Inigo Montoya held the rank of "wizard". And wizards dwell into magic like rabies in a pack of wolves. I stand by my statement.
@_date: 2013-10-04 08:35:21
Well, who's attacking who now?
What does the fact that i don't like trans people for their fake existence have to do with your approval of child porn.
I'd hazard to guess you are in a child porn supporter, because "open mindness", right?
You are a true piece of shit.
I think that "pot head" remark of mine hit on the spot.
@_date: 2013-10-09 07:59:16
Only if racists knew, it would avoid so much hate.
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:48:30


Well, there you go.
I suppose you're right, aside from the moral every day items such as drugs, child pornography, guns, god knows what other shit they were selling there, they were mainly focused on selling bibles and electronics.
Fucking hipster.

I call this bullshit, especially the part where your mom has a friend (which I assume is her age) that is also using Bitcoin.

I think the transplant analogy is correct, though.
@_date: 2013-10-08 11:45:15
Oh, no, honey, that won't happen, no worries.
See, here, in Europe, we build real houses, nit the barns and cottages you Americans call "a house". Ours don't burn so easily, not being made out of wood. Plus, it's a new house, so it has no inflammatory materials, and all kind of systems to prevent the spread of a fire.
Next time, think of a better insult. I think when they cut your balls off they took out your thought device, because you trannies can't make an insult if your balls depended on it.
Oh... that's right, I get it now.
@_date: 2013-10-08 20:43:38
Hate? Not at all.
I just say we should call things what they are: a man is a man, no matter is he loses a leg in an accident or has surgery to remove a kidney or decides to cut his penis off. And a woman is a woman no matter what she does to her body.
But i suppose i do have a lot of disrespect for them.
And it's easy to understand why.
Say, 4 years ago i had a college reunion. Not a school organized one, but a few of us met and decided we should call this guy and that guy and that girl, and the other one, and  the redhead, etc.
So we did.
And there is a guy i haven't seen in 10 years that decided he wants to be a woman, as silly as that sounds.
And funny, cause the guy used to bang chicks so hot that most of us had no idea how to talk to.
And he took most of us by surprise, as we had no idea he no longer goes by Anton (not his real name), but Antonia.
So the night starts, all laugh and drink and dance, and have a good time. And after a few drinks, i say, word for word: "for me, you're always gonna be that guy that banged Monica", Monica (not her real name) being a chick from college that nobody could touch. She was great looking, every single one of us tried to either date her or sleep with her, and one day he simply did it.
But apparently that was an insult or something, and he started crying: "how can you tell something like that to me", "why do you have so much hate for me", "you should be more tolerant", started screaming, made a huge scene.
Alright, i tried to apologize, as far as i or anyone there could see, i did absolutely nothing wrong.
He went away crying, yelling.
And then it started, me getting angry calls and threats and angry texts and stuff like that because i apparently, and i shit you not, this is what it said: that i "hate women, am an intolerable asshole, should burn in hell, misogynist bastard", etc
They even tried to corner and beat the hell out of me, but i have an athletic background and did boxing for 15 years, so that went very bad for them. Probably you should not try to corner a guy while wearing heels either.
Which is funny to me, because i absolutely did nothing wrong whatsoever. Fuck, I have three gay friends, none of them have issues with me, we hang out regularly. 
And that made me thinking, saying "you used to bang the hottest chicks" must have clicked.
Yeah, he regrets the transition. Why the hell did he went with it in the first place?
And I've noticed that most trans hate themselves after they go with it. A little research and discovered that 60% of them end up in suicide.
There are very few success stories, and those that are successful hide the fact they used to be a man.
So i decided to call things what they are. And if people hate hearing how things are, that's their problem, not mine.
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:23:57
You want more arguments than "selling drugs", "distributing child porn", "selling guns"?
The hell is wrong with you? Too much pot?
@_date: 2013-10-09 08:26:20
yeah? Well, personally, I'd like to see a trans woman give birth to a child and a trans man producing some sperm. You know, for science.

Initially the story was more complex, but i had to dumb it down to get the desired reaction on Reddit. I think the lighter version worked better.
@_date: 2013-10-09 09:34:57
I am familiar with the Theseus paradox.
However, a Ford performs perfectly with it's original hardware.
Replacing the original hardware with new one, from a completely different, incompatible, car maker does not make the car better. Hell, it may even make it perform worse.
Think of people that go through transplant. Say, kidney transplant.
They get some functionality from their new kidney, but it's not the best thing and it is limiting.
Same for a heart transplant and other body parts.
