It didn't go missing during the 2011 hack. It happened just before Christmas 2011. The coins just vanished from my account, there was no transactions going out, it was as though they were never there. I pestered support for months but they were no help at all and eventually gave I up. Your defiantly and idiot.

You can black out some of the details on your documents and Bitstamp will still accept them.  I sent them a scan of a  bank statement with the account number blacked out and a scan of my passport with the passport number blacked. They verified me straight away.

What inspires you to hang around on here posting this sort of thing? I'm genuinely interested.  If I don't like something, I generally don't hang around in a subreddit dedicated to it posting shite... Just wondering what your motivation is.

It also confuses me.  It's not like bitcoin is going to have any negative effect on your life if you don't use it. I've never seen people go in to other subreddits like and hang around in the new queue for hours telling everyone how dumb tennis is and how they are all wasting money on buying racquets.  
I can understand how someone would dislike bitcoin or not want to use it, but I can't see any good reason to actively seek out people who *do* like bitcoin and spend your day telling them not to.. It is bizarre

I've been involved with Bitcoin since early 2011 and still don't know who is trustworthy... Would you direct new people to sites like BTC-E?  They haven't run off with everyone's money yet, but I'm not sure I would call them trustworthy. Is there any BTC company that we can actually guarantee to be trustworthy?

Bitcoin has gone up from $2 after the 2011 crash to a current price of $530. It would have been pretty hard to buy and sell at the *wrong* times. If you can't make money in a market like that, it is your own fault...
@_date: 2014-04-08 21:50:52


Yeh, in retrospect there are a few things that could have been done differently. It certainly confuses a lot of my less tech savvy friends. Even my friends that understand that you can buy fractions, still want to buy either 1 coin or nothing and wouldn't be happy owning 0.25btc.  It is a strange psychological barrier for some people..
@_date: 2014-04-12 18:40:26

Gox hasn't given this as an explanation...
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:06:51
If you install the wallet on a flash drive the actual wallet.dat (the important bit) file is not installed on the flash drive unless you change where the data directory is stored. Your wallet file is in users/yourusername/appdata/roaming/bitcoin.  If you want to store your coins on a flashdrive you will need to move the data directory to the flashdrive and then run the wallet manually everytime to use that data directory (Ican't remember how to do this off the top of my head)
The much easier option would be to get electrum portable, which is actually intended to be a portable wallet.  As you have it at the moment, your coins are not stored on the flashdrive, they are on your PC.

He is selling free software for $47 AND you have to trust him not to have slipped anything in there.  Only download Ubuntu or the paper wallet generating code from trusted sources, and definitely never pay for it.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:35:04
Ubuntu is free and the safest way to get it is directly from the Ubuntu site. The code to generate paper wallets is free and the safest way to get it is directly from their Github page.

The idea is not cool at all. He is adding a layer of risk to the process (you have to trust him) and charging you nearly $50 for the privilege. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:20:43
He is not providing anything. Ubuntu is free to download and so is the code to generate paper wallets. You pre-download the wallet generator, there is no need for Ubunu to connect to the internet. This guy is providing nothing new and introducing risk (you have to trust the guy selling it) .  He is selling free products for $47 and ADDING a layer of risk to the process.
Only a complete retard would think this is a good idea.
