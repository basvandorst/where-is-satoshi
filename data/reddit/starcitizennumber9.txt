There was a bitcointalk forum thread some time ago, 1-2 months or so, which demonstrated proof that some of the blockchain.info admins seemed to have the power to extract the private keys for any account they choose, on demand. I regretfully never bothered saving the link to that particular thread.

I hate PayPal but this is not paypal's fault. 
It's the insane anti terror, anti money laundering laws that force them (the payment processors) to be a "police" and bully you. 
It's the voters who allow such politics to survive that is to blame.
And this is already on its way into bitcoin too. Just wait 2 more years and this insanity will cripple 99% of all the bitcoin exchanges and it's customers too. 
There's probably only one exchange that will dodge this insanity and that is btc-e.com

Coindesk is just a propaganda machine that prints anything as long as you pay them money. Included in the "service" you pay for, is also deletion of comments which does not agree with the propaganda you paid them to spread. 
This is more or less how mainstream media works. But coindesk seems to have brought the propaganda-machine to a whole new level of epicness.

No difference seen through the eyes of a security-centric engineer. That only means the public may be able to realize all their coins are stolen within a month after its a fact, worst case. It does not prevent theft or make the exchange any more secure. Such a report only shows the coins are "there" at a certain point in time. 
If mtgox had done a similar audit monthly, there would still be 600k+++ coins stolen. Because all the coins were stolen through a server exploit. The only difference would be that the theft may have been discovered slightly faster, at very max 1 month after the fact.

Tony, if there's something you know little about its clearly crypto-currency technology. By endorsing these shitcoins you probably lost quite a bit respect from the community. Can't you just tell the truth and admit you are anti-competitive and prefer Bitcoin as the sole winner instead of trying to hide this fact by faking you are competitive by mentioning shitcoins that will most likely never gain any mentionable degree of market share at all?

Yet again western news like coindesk fail to understand "illegal" and "ban" in Russia does not mean the same as they do in western countries.
If USA banned bitcoin it would stop business there. No doubt. 
In Russia, if banned.. it means there will be a mandatory "recurring fee" to be paid in order to avoid shut down/jail. Or what you western people may call "bribes".

Your mathematics gives you confusion because you assume the market is "honest". Which is the normal thing to do as a human. However the current market price is not "honest" and of course your math will then turn out to have a confusing answer.
The price has been pumped beyond sustainable level and is now being pulled down again by the laws of market-gravity. Pro traders would simply answer "politically correct" with "the trading-instrument is currently overbought and needs a correction further down".

It used to be treatable until the gov went totally mental and regulated the drugs that actually works well for treatment of severe permanent (chemical imbalance) depression that it is no longer available for anyone at all. 
So yea. A few decades ago your statement used to be "true". Now the only (chemical type) treatments available is usually shit drugs like Prozac etc which only works on mild depression and at same time carries a high risk of making it even worse. 
Sure you still have psychiatric treatment in the form  of therapeutic talk sessions etc which of course still helps people who are *not* suffering a chemical imbalance induced depression. But for those who suffer a chemical imbalance; tough luck buddy. You'll only have access to virtually non working drugs at this point.

The funniest thing about your OP post is, you are basically creating a Streisand Effect.

But thanks to your silly attempt to downplay the manipulation for no reason whatsoever, you are actually creating much more awareness about it by trying to spew out constant silly arguments that "proves" it does not exist.
Why are you wasting time on putting out a fire that obviously is not burning? LOL
Lets make a nice analogy: You essentially murdered a family in the forest and buried the bodies.

Remember, you were the FIRST one to start a personal attack with me, by claiming "those who talk about murphy's law don't understand it". You know *nothing* about me. And you know even less about Murphy's Law.
Anyways, dont worry about Murphy's Law. It will be a tiny midget compared to the coming regulative HELL the governments will put on bitcoin within next 3-5 years. This regulative HELL will cripple 99% of bitcoin's growth and will be much more powerful than what Murphy's Law will be putting on bitcoin's shoulders.

This is how biz is done in Russian related territory. Hard/impossible for western people to comprehend without living there. 
Fact is btc-e is still the only exchange that never lost any significant assets in hacker raids. They also have the most versatile and fast working deposit and withdraw system in the world. Which should for a seasoned businessman be clear signals that the owners of btc-e are far from amateurs. 
TL;DR: BTC-E knows how to grease the wheels in a Russian territory filled with zero laws and rules and nothing but corruption. They may use solutions that may look scary for western people but is looked upon as necessary to survive as a "honest" business in a Russian citizen's eyes.

The war on drugs have proven it's the most perfect way of burning as much taxpayer money as possible without gaining anything else than more expenses, because each locked up inmate costs the society about 250 USD per day, per inmate in jail.
And look at last darknet bust, which involved international cooperation, took a year to accomplish, burned probably 100+ million USD in the process, and the bust only managed to seize about 1 million USD of value in bitcoin. All in the name of a victimless "crime" of selling herbs which humans used to smoke and eat for thousands of years with no problem earlier.

No need to attack bitcoin network directly when other much easier attack vectors already exists...
There is a reason why several governmental agencies in multiple countries are in a quantum arms race at this point. And this reason I just explained is probably one of them. 
Fit these quantum SSL decrypters at all ISP backbones through a secret gov-issued gag-order and ta-da; all usernames and passwords ever sent through SSL instantly snagged and recorded. Hell, I bet they are recording the SSL data already so it's ready to be fed into a giant quantum decryptor when it's ready in 10-15 years from now.

Bitcoin is by core trustless technology and you come strolling in thinking you can be successful by offering a hosted centralized trading bot which require 100% trust and a central point of failure. 
Imagine 90% of the market using your centralized tech to trade. 
Now imagine the hackers who's hacked and stole millions of Bitcoin from mtgox bitcoinica and dusins  of other exchanges arrives at *your* centralized hosted bot service, takes control over *all* the traders simultaneously and crash the whole market to hell after they put up a buy wall to catch all the cheap coins raining.
Yea sure man. Brilliant idea. You must be some kind of Albert Einstein of VPS security-knowledge to pull this off without a future disaster of mtgox epic proportions. 
Good luck buddy. But I honestly don't think you are going to reach the stars with a rocket requiring trust as fuel when the law of gravity in this crypto universe have a base foundation of trustless mathematics.

Open Bazaar is a awesome idea, but this reputation system seems highly prone to scam.
You do realize over 2 million bitcoins have been stolen from exchanges and other places last 3 years? 
You really dont believe the crooks who stole all these coins will be willing to "burn" them for "reputation" in open bazaar, in order to steal even more coins? Sounds a little naive to me to believe this wont happen, does it not?
edit: and just so you know, this "burning for reputation" is directly comparable with a governmental level "premium taxation" attempt to reduce fraud etc in markets, which have been proven time after time to be extremely inefficient and the crooks in the existing markets have shown they can pay the premium tax much more easy than the non-crooks.

Wrong. That statement is fear-mongery and does not belong in a free and healthy market. Particularly not in a market you want to see growing over time. Without speculators taking their part of the risk in the market the price would plummet to the bottom of the ocean.
What I'm saying is, solvency reports as a means of proving the level of "security" towards the customers assets are useless. Because a solvency report is only about the solvency at a specific point in time, and is not related to technical security at all. 
The *only* real way of proving security towards customers would be to offer account-insurance where customers are 100% secured against theft and hacking by having a insurance company reimburse the whole loss in the event of a theft. Only then will it truly be "safe".
This is achievable and the benefit would be that in order to get such a  insurance the insurance corporation would demand the exchange to perform notorious level of security audits and also solvency proof in order to be sure they are not wasting the insurance.

Mark karpeles did several public bitcoin wallet transfers which also were published at bitcointalk forums.

It's run by several very well known Bitcoin investor celebs. 
Edit: and if I don't remember wrong you can even "sync" gocoin api to the deterministic electrum wallet.

The world is bigger than the Bitcoin sub reddit. The sub is a drop in the ocean at this point. 
Which is actually good since there's a lot of shill and crap articles and manipulation attempts here.

Make the list demand a small listing fee paid in Bitcoin. If they don't accept Bitcoin chances are they won't have Bitcoin to pay for the listing fee.

Tl;dr: So this dude wanna ban cash so they can more easy steal everyone's money in order to keep even more people at the poverty level so they can be more exploited as slave workers. 
Great idea. He should get the Norwegian peace price.  Immediately. At least three times in a row.

Jed McCaleb has a PhD in asshole behavior.  No surprise here. This is just a tiny pre-fart before he unleashes a full truckload of his best crap he saved for the ultimate crap unload. 
Remember McCaleb officially announced he would dump 9 billion ripple coins onto the market? No? Market crashed to oblivion. But did McCaleb sell his coins? Nope. He bought all the remaining coins at the bottom instead and laughed all the way to the bank. 
So yea. Ripple is super legit.

How's the gestapo-styled forced gathering of miner business-secrets going along by the way? Still only freezing their accounts until they coughs up all the business secrets or have you moved forward using more effective methods like stealing all their funds unless they comply etc?

"Hoarding" is being used by Keynesian morons who think the best thing for economy is to force people to spend all their money as fast as they can on things they don't need. And thus also forcing majority of earth to be stuck in poverty. 
As long as there's Keynesian morons around there will be equally moronic wordings like "hoarding" around with the sole purpose of making it sound foolish to be a thoughtful saver and the smart thing is to be a reckless spender.

If you can't explain Bitcoin in 15 seconds, you have failed to keep the attention of 99.9999% of the population. 
Try again. 
Edit: the down voters here obviously have no clue or knowledge about the majority of the populations cognitive attention span and thinks a 10 minute video containing information-overload will convert the world into loving Bitcoin. Good luck with that, when the average attention span of a human is no more than 15-30 seconds.

TA works but it only works if you keep your knowledge secret. All respectable books about Trading mentions this in some form or other. 
It's as simple as this: if you figure out a magic indicator formula, shut the f up about it and only use it for yourself. If you tell anyone about your finding it will stop working almost instantly. If you shut the f up about it you may be lucky and get to use the magic signal for a few months until someone else manages to figure out the same secret. 
If you do not understand why this is how it works then you should step away from TA trading immediately and do something else. Like gardening flowers or something.

"Only investors which don't understand what they are investing in, needs to diversify their portfolio"

The most amazing part was the fact it appeared in an article which explained a guy who folded 600 x dollar bills to pay tax with just to annoy the IRS of the extra work of unfolding them...

Imagine the ATM machine asking you that question every time you withdrew fiat currency from your bank account. Mmmm. I'd say that would be to "go too far."

Join the dam TS server yourself guys, its all open, zero passwords or anything special to get in. 
Ive been listening to that channel for weeks, and its just a bunch of crazy traders who likes to chat share knowledge and ride the waves, scalping the mini trends etc.
Sure, they discuss theories of manipulation openly there too, but i highly doubt any of them have the power to move this market in any degree. To do that, you need hundreds of thousands of coins.

Regarding the "evidence" link  mentioned above;
I highly doubt this one is real, BTCVIX and flibbr never ever use text chat to communicate. They both use voice all the time, the only text they write are direct HTTP links etc which are impossible to communicate with voice.
So, i'm inclined to call this screenshot a "photoshopped joke"

Amazing to see a logic well thought out reply like yours getting down voted.
