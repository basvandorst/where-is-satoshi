College is so useless. It's not like going to college can act as a positive signal in the labour market. Oh wait.

Good on ya man! Consider donating to [Mary's Meals.]( They set up food in schools in impoverished areas so that children can learn and get some food at the same time. This is better than the children not going to school and spending time looking for food or kids going to school hungry!

How on earth can someone steal bitcoins from this guy using his Reddit? I genuinely don't know.

So you mean to say "it's not real socialism"? Where have I heard that before?
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:29:02
Sorry to hear this man. The lesson taken away should be that lamenting about money to such an extent isn't right. Might sound cliched, but there is more to life than money!

I would love to trade Bitcoin, however the market is not nearly as liquid as FX markets.

Fast car, but ugly as fuck!

Don't beat yourself up. You probably would have sold off at $300.

What will happen in 8-15 years?

Time will tell if your pessimism was warranted.
@_date: 2018-03-31 11:15:37
Maybe if you repeat this enough times, you may *just* believe the horseshit you wrote.
@_date: 2017-09-22 22:11:34
Yes, please explain how not telling people the exact time they will not be needed in their job constitutes as fraud.

Lol so people should wait 40 years before realising any gains on Bitcoin. gg
@_date: 2018-11-27 13:40:42
I would still consider Bitcoin a success. From $0 to $3000 is impressive.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:36:03
And this is a good thing? Milennials do a lot of dumb shit.

Proportionally, it was when it peaked at around $1100 and went back down to around $500. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:50:54
This bubble will burst. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:36:15
The correct answer.

If Bitcoin supporters are dumb enough to put value on graphs like this, it doesn't really help their cause....
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:25:26
My only issue with Bitcoin is how illiquid it is.
Truly, there is no exchange where I can buy at $1400 without the stupendous spreads compared to currencies and stocks.
@_date: 2017-05-03 10:11:10
It's a major issue for prospective traders.

But didn't he also try and hire hitmen for some of his partners?
Not saying that his sentence isn't absurd, but still.

So monopoly is anticapitalist but the inventors became filthy rich afterwards by selling their product through the free market. Commies/socialists disgust me.
