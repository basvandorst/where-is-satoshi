I wanted to buy one at $300. That was about a week ago.

It's going to have to stabilize somewhat if we're ever going to use it as currency. It seems there's a low proportion of people on localbitcoin offering trades for anywhere under $1000. I think this thing is cool and I'm willing to waste $500 to see what happens, but I'm not using it as an investment tool. The high prices seem more related to it's novelty and current difficulty of making new coins, in my not very informed opinion.
So many people talk about buying Bitcoin as if it were a stock/bond, which seems wrong for some reason. It's a new type of currency that's only going to gain value by being usable as a common means of exchange. But right now it seems that most of the value in Bitcoin is in being able to exchange it with other pseudo-investors/brokers. 
There are shops that are starting to accept it, but I wonder what will happen when they want to "cash out" - will there be other goods and services they can get with their earned bitcoin, or are they going to have to jump through more hoops to get those coins converted to cash they can pay bills and taxes with, paying all the associated exchange fees in the process? Most retailers will not want what equates to just another payment provider in this case, especially if that Bitcoin they got could be worth half it's amount when they process everything next week.Conversely, I don't see consumers too willing to pay an amount that may equate to double that in losses had they just waited a week. 
But hey, the good news is I'm probably wrong and there's probably a simple solution to this. This is just what I've been thinking as I've slowly been making my way into the world of Bitcoin.

True. I do enjoy gambling every now and then.

Yeah, I'd think/hope (based on nothing) it'll land around $200-$250
