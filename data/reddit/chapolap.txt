Looking back the past couple of days. Can someone with certainty pinpoint the news why BTC is rising from 3200 to 3700?

Looks like someone is emotional about BTC.

Why would the government shutdown promote crowds to buy into a cryptocurrency that is wildly unaccepted and likely to drop even further? 
The thought process that people want to protect themselves during unemployment by stashing their savings into crypto seem very unlikely to me. Wouldn’t that be very stupid?

You literally solidified one sentence from my paragraph and call it out of context. If you would look 1 inch higher then you’d see a bit more of context. You’re welcome

If you ask me here again in two weeks time I might give you one of my points. Until then, I give you a cliffhanger.

Great elaboration. Not

Definitely emotional.

That is what I’m thinking too. When BTC rose to fame in Q4FY17 I was feeling all along that whales were at play both manipulating the valuation and media simultaneously. Nothing made sense how a technology with relatively small impact that had been around for 8 years would catch fire in a matter of months- globally. Where was the compelling event for such a thing to happen?
Now every major pump I can see Michael Dell sitting there after taking Dell/EMC private and playing us all to make a few extra billions pocket money to pay off investors.

Is this because btc can be tracked to its source of sender and receiver? Could u explain what u mean?
