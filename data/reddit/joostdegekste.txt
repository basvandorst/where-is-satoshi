FOMO is a bad investing strategy.

We may go lower. But long term BULLISH

Hopefully 2019 will be kind, or 2020 or 2021

How do I apply for food stamps?
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:08:31

That's pretty likely bear market comes bear market goes. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:43:25
I'm ready to buuuuuy
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:33:18
Did you say the same thing in 2014!?
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:09:24
I'm accumulating in September if we are still in the bear market. Otherwise I'll just ride this shit out. Tonight however, I'm getting drunk. Enjoy your day guys, it won't come back.

It's about percentages not absolute numbers

Jesus that was disturbing to read lol

I really get the argument for gun rights and I am all for the right to protect yourself and your property. But being from the Netherlands the fact is that there are way less burglars that actually carry weapons because there are almost no household with guns and having a gun while breaking in will dramatically increase the penalty if caught. So not having a gun in the EU seems to be less of a safety hazard then in the US.  I too feel the need to protect myself and my family and my property though. Can't have a gun but I do have big dogs at least that's something right. If it weren't for the dogs I would feel unsafe in a wealthy area.

If you believe that of course you shouldn't buy. Most people here don't believe that to be the case.

Why is nobody talking about the Swiss ETF approval? [
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:23:22
Hey that's the most important thing. In hindsight everything is easy.
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:11:28
How long were you holding in what timeframe? If you manage to buy in lower that is a good move. I was more so talking about people capitulating and leaving for good.
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:34:16
Lol with all the doom and gloom here I'm tempted to accumulate more. I'll wait a little while longer but why does everybody go completely mental!? Get a grip we have seen these cycles before.
@_date: 2018-11-17 22:07:27
Patience is important we'll find the bottom eventually.
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:23:48
It's just how these cycles go. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:25:41
Yeah that was a smart move. But that doesn't mean it is smart to sell right now looking at the long term.
