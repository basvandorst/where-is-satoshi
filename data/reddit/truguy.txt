I’m feeling the pain. I held mine since 2013 through the lows. It got above $7k a few weeks ago — so fast was the rise, I traded it all for ether. That went up $150 so I thought I was good, and then Bitcoin kept going up while Ether has been going down. It’s been a tough week watching for that correction that hasn’t come — and having to momentarily root against Bitcoin. But if Bitcoin corrects it could send a massive amount of money into alts, so maybe Ether will shoot up, then I’ll diversify into bitcoin and a maybe one or two others.

Really? Not even a hint, huh? You should try reading:

Did the government invent the Internet? Really? They can't even adequately build a healthcare enrollment website. Of course, they didn't build that, either. They contracted it out to a private firm. In fact, that's who built the internet... not politicians, not NASA, it was private industry that did it. 
The basic TCP/IP protocol was not what govt wanted. Govt spent years tax dollars trying to develop the OSI networking system. TCP/IP was created by collaboration between universities and corporations, built from the bottom-up. OSI was organized through the UN, built from the top-down, built by committee, you can add your own negative repercussions.
The repercussion that matters is that OSI never worked. TCP/IP did, and does.
Saying the government built the internet is like saying the FCC built radio.
Internet as we think of it couldn't really occur until personal destop computers became available, wtih monitors. People began building their own in the early 80's, with Radio Shack parts. 
So, when a wireless mesh network arrives (completely independent of any government infrastructure) are you gonna give credit for that to the government, as well?

Eh. It's like saying people needed to be convinced to buy a computer... pretty soon, it will just become obvious to everyone. We don't have to convince the public. We have to build a better way of doing things. One that ignores the government and allows it to whither on the vine. We are getting close... unless we cave. By we, I mean this community. The general public will go where leaders pave the way. We have to pave the way. Thankfully, we probably won't have to die in a war to make this happen, but maybe?

Good thing I'm not arguing for the status quo, since that is exactly what is being shredded on a daily basis. That's the nature of technology and the net. It democratizes and decentralizes power. The point will come when power is so decentralized it will be in each of our hands, rather than an authoritarian state. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:47:18
I could be very wrong, however it seems to suggest that bitcoin becomes taxable upon spending it. Therefore, if I buy a computer, with Bitcoin, at TigerDirect, the Feds believe I owe them money. 
Of course, they are not yet saying TigerDirect would be responsible, but they are saying you are. In only a matter of time, they will use this fact to craft further legislation.

What I meant to imply was that my feeling was only temporary... that I believe in 100%. I was only speaking tongue and cheek, figuring that that frustration (of dipping prices) was felt by many. In other words, it was just a light hearted bitch. 
In the real world, I actually DO talk to business owners about Bitcoin adoption. Daily. Which, in all honesty, is one reason I get frustrated... not because I don't believe in bitcoin, but because I get tired of hearing these people ask daily why the price seems stagnant or like it's going down. That's all.

So, the Feds want to use Bitcoin as the route to unrolling a national sales tax? If you can't spend it without taxation, they want you to pay a percentage of your spend. 
Honestly, this is how we should respond to the government on this issue: "Fuck off."
They don't own you. They don't own your computer. They don't own your mining resources. They don't own your creations. They don't own your bitcoin. 
Who the fuck do THEY think they are, telling us what WE have to do? Of course, it's the same old story, but this is as good of a time as any to buck the trend.

"The revolution will not be televised" refers to the grassroots/under-the-radar movement that will result in the next great "revolution" of the people... an uprising in freedom. Monetization simply refers to the fact that Bitcoin will drive the "under-the-radar" aspect of this movement toward liberty.

Well, that would then be the problem. The US government thinks it owns you, no matter where you earn a "currency". Does that seriously not bother you? I'm not sure you noticed, from my discussions, but I'm not really bothering over the policy details of government regulation and taxation, I'm bothering over the precepts used to support them, in the first place. In other words, my fundamental belief is that no institution has the right to claim ownership of my work/labor. 
If they want to tax their phony currency, sure, go ahead... as far as I'm concerned, that is a lost battle. They will take your money as long as they are the ones issuing it. Fine. However, the government has about as much right to tax bitcoin as it does to tax your video game scores.

Your willingness to callously walk past the essential needs of those who are suffering, while you possess the means to alleviate their suffering, is greed. When I used the word "violate" I was using it in a broader sense to include a violation of moral conscience. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 20:45:34
Wanting something for yourself is not greed. The willingness to violate others, for what you desire, is.

The truth is that none of us are without guilt. That said, we are each responsible for weighing our own needs and resources versus those of others. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 01:19:51
It's not subjective but it's up to you to decide. Therefore, you need to decide upon your own needs and the kind of life you want for yourself -- and weigh that against your convictions regarding others. Hopefully, you will find a way to strive toward both goals. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:07:36
Something can be objectively true yet require subjective discernment to apprehend it as true. Though I believe something to be objectively true does not mean I can violate another's choice in the matter, especially when they do not apprehend the truthfulness of it. Therefore, while there is objective truth, not all truth is obvious and the responsibility for heeding it is upon each individual.

Outlaws tend to use what works. They've used and stolen bills, coins, etc. I understand what you're saying. It would be great if bitcoin could appear more "moral," but the same things that make it a good choice for "criminals" are the same things that make it "good" for everyone else. Not to mention the fact that it is only a currency. It's not moral or immoral. That's the takeaway from all this that people need to learn. We can't stop how people use bitcoin, but we can influence and educate people so they understand what is really is (and isn't). 
@_date: 2015-09-27 11:40:06
One reason Bitcoin has value is because it's programmable money. You can tell it when to pay someone, for example. No other money does that. Bashing smart contracts misses the point.
