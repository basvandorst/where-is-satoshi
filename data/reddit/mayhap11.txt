Agreed but also don't forget the biggest problem with borrowing money with a deflationary currency: lets say you borrow 50BTC to buy a house, you currently earn 10BTC per year so no problem. But BTC increases in value every year more than your productivity increases, so every year you actually get a pay cut (costs of all goods go down every year as well due to the deflationary nature of BTC) so in a few years time you still owe 40BTC on your home loan but your home is only worth 30BTC and you now earn 5BTC per year. You are trapped with a loan you will never be able to pay off, which is effectively increasing in value every year.

Pay attention to the Mayer multiple. Google it. These people are wrong to say that you can't pick good opportunities to begin selling and then begin buying again.

starting? I seriously hope all the 'banksters are all crooks', 'inflation is the devil' posts on this sub are just a tiny minority of this community otherwise Bitcoin is in big trouble.

I doubt it. There are a lot of delusional people out there that think that living as a subsistence farmer is some kind of utopia.

Socialism by itself is not a huge problem. Some of the wealthiest countries in the world per capita are social democracies. The problem is reckless application of socialism without being able to fund it.
The idea that governments are scared of an armed populace is stupid. This isn't the 1800s anymore, the people have no answer to drones and tanks and helicopter gunships. You've been drinking too much NRA coolaid.
@_date: 2019-08-09 01:27:22
I think you are being facetious but it is 100% true, there is no reason for a government to pay down it's debts. And that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Debt works different for governments than it does for the plebs.

People seek out information that confirms their currently held beliefs. Its a massive problem with people just getting their information from circle-jerk FB groups and (gasp) sub reddits.

Also no chargebacks, which companies especially like.

If you bought another currency with USD and it appreciated and then you converted back to USD you would be expected to pay tax on that income. Why people here think that BTC deserves some special status is beyond me.

Donald Trump is objectively not an intelligent person. You can listen to him speak on any subject for any length of time and recognise this. The fact that you and millions of other people are even dumber than him doesn't change that.

When a stock falls by 5% it 'plunges', when BTC falls by 5% it's a daily occurrence. Just people unconsciously comparing BTC to investments.

A loan for a house is very different to a loan for a new car or a holiday.

2017 was 18mo ago and people are stupid and greedy. BTC is up over 300% in 2mo, a lot of people are going to want to get in on that action despite what history has taught us.

You had $5000 at the beginning of the year and you still have $5000. No reasonable person could possibly think there is tax owed on this.


What? It rests on the fact that something was purchased for one price and sold for another price and a profit was made. Therefore tax is owed on that amount. It couldn't be more simple. 
It has nothing to do with appeal to authority (maybe have a quick check of what that phrase means) and nothing to do with USD reserve currency status, it applies equally to buying and selling of anything in any country of the world with any currency in the world.

I wonder if its possible to accurately determine the current price of bitcoin based solely on the prevailing sentiment of this sub.

The UK has become a full blown 'nanny state' shithole. And the way the public said enough was Brexit? I hope the people of other western democracies have more sense than to follow them into the abyss.

People would love to lend money. Think bitcoin, if I could have lent you 10,000 BTC 5 years ago in the knowledge that you would pay me back 10,000 BTC (plus interest) today, I would have jumped at the chance.
The problem is with borrowing money in a deflationary currency. If it were a big enough loan (eg. 30 year mortgage) you could literally never pay it off.

There's an address in there with total receipts of [124k BTC]( and 120 transactions. Do these whales not care about coin control or is there something else going on here

Looking at the [Mayer Multiple]( every top is lower in relation to the long term average then previous. Even the massive bubble in 2017 was the smallest to date in comparison. The old advice of buying when the MM was under 2.4 and then unwinding when MM went above 2.4 is now obsolete as even the bubbles now don't break 2.4.
The crypto landscape *has* changed, to assume that what has happened in the past will continue to happen is a fools errand.

Techniques will almost certainly become available in the future to break the SHA-256 encryption. But when that happens Bitcoin can fork to a harder encryption.

I honestly don't see the point of converting fiat to BTC just to convert to fiat again for a transaction. Why not just use fiat for fiat purchases?

If someone contacts you on Reddit promising to make you money it can be safely assumed to be a scam. Nothing more needs to be said. Am I missing something here? I feel like I'm missing something here with all these scam warnings, of course it's a scam!
