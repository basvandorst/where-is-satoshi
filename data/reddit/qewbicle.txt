Where banks decide to use it as a backend, like an action clearing house. Big companies then decide to use it for large purchases with other large companies. All the while fiat is still used.

I believe if Bitgo automatically signed the transaction, then they are liable for not reviewing large transactions. If the system is developed for your end to sign automatically, and their end signs automatically, then what's the difference, isn't this less secure than using one part signatures where a person has to view and manually sign.  
Being a person that does not have degrees in system security or any computer science/programming, this just sounds insecure to just sign transactions without verification.

It isn't right for the bfx tokens to be worth $1 and for them to be traded for users to get their value back. None of my bitcoins were taken in the hack, but then were taken by your company afterwards, as well as usd and litecoins. I have no faith that my whole amount taken from you guys will ever be restored. I made a post here:  
  
   
as well as sent in a support ticket. I would like to have some private, documented conversations concerning this subject.

What I don't understand is, if the compromise was on your end, then how did Bitgo sign the second part of the multisig address?

Thanks for the sentiment. I don't agree that I would have to suffer the loss of a haircut. I'm not a lawyer though. From what I understand is that they can't do socialized loss unless they are filing for bankruptcy, so them taking my coins is illegal. However, I can be misinformed.  
If they continue on this path to recovery and avoid having to file for bankruptcy altogether. Where does this leave them and I. Let's say the value of bitcoins go way up, do I then get the equivalent of coins back based on the value of $604, or the new high. What I want is for the total of bitcoins (as well as my usd and ltc) to be restored in whole. No matter if the value of bitcoins reach $200 or $1000. But what will likely happen is I would get the usd equivalent.  
For example:  
1 btc @ 604 = 604  
lets say value goes up to $1000 / btc  
I would then get back  
0.604 btc instead of the whole amount they took.  
The opposite is true if the value goes down, (@ $200, I would get back 3.02btc) unless at that time they choose to return the value differently and give back 1 btc. This is why it's important for them to spell it out before hand.
This gets worse if they open it up for trading.  Will the value of the bfx tokens ever reach the point where I can claim what they took from me. It's a game that I don't want to play.  
On top of this, bfx tokens are now a centralized debt based token. The same thing my bitcoins were meant to hedge against. So how does this represent my bitcoins. It represents fiat and has little to no value in comparison.  
So, the main point I need to stand for is that I do not accept this action from them and I want to come to some terms on a one on one, making it legally binding. I can not fold and lose my ability to sue on hopes and dreams.  
Thanks for taking the time to listen.

You can't be serious. In a hard fork, if you had a coin on one side, you have a coin on the other side, like with BCH, but not with Litecoin.

For storage. You never know who's going to flop. That's the reality. This can be due to hacking, forks, business practices or regulations. I would not recommend any for long term storage if you can avoid it. But if I had to and didn't want to worry about it, I might consider Coinbase. I'd just be worried that regulations might change when I'm not looking and they would somehow strong arm my coins away according to their new found self determined regulation if I couldn't log in for some time to "update" my information.

Makes more sense to make it a sidechain.  
Also, if the cached files expire, then it is self pruning. The expiration date is extended depending on popularity. The download has a small cost that then gets split at a fair ratio to owner of files and miner. Alternatively to expiration, it can be archived forever at a decent cost. Expand it to include open source projects where fees are paid by repository owner instead of end user and the fee will be a bit smaller than current forms of centralized repo services and popularity of development and use determines expiration instead.

Personally, I'd like to see some altcoins become functional sidechains to Bitcoin. I reason that it may be more challenging to spin up a new blockchain and get enough miners built up to secure that network then it would take to convert already spun up chains that have a heavy amount of miners. Miners could just redirect which chain they point to and a solidly built sidechain can quickly capture a high level of security. In either case, I'd watch each type of mining technology and keep an eye out for which coins can become a sidechain, and watch sidechain ideas and see which algorithm it uses.  
Ethereum has functional tokens that serve specific purposes, these coins/tokens create an ecosystem where they are compatilbe/swappable so you can do the function you desire at that time. Similarly, Bitcoins altcoins can serve the same purpose to Bitcoin. The main difference is these sidechains can carry there own volume of transactions rather than trying to stuff it all onto one blockchain.  
If those things come to be true. Then I'd expect other networks to pop up in the future. We might see The Big Three be Ethereums ecosystem as one, Bitcoins ecosystem as one, and some future ecosystem as another, with gateways between them.  
Bitcoins dominance doesn't need to be made by making other coins obsolete, but by merging them in as children.

@_date: 2015-12-27 14:33:41
In standard terms, there's more as implied by my first point. Of course there's more data that can utilize the blockchain, and there are more things happening in a block. But the point of there being a record from point "a" to point "c" is to proof point "c" rightfully carries the input. Are you stating that point "b" can be deleted and output from point "a" will magically change from point "b" to "c". If that were possible then the security, provability of the blockchain is broken.

Totally.  
But this may lead to users wanting to post encrypted messages. The problem is which key would you use to encrypt so that only your friends, multiple people can decrypt, but others can't get ahold of.  Sort of like making your profile private, but actually private.  
(Mental ramble follows without much thought and knowledge, but some experience using pgp)  
PGP/GPG needs to be updated to allow the opposite of multi-sig, multi-receive. How, I don't know. Maybe...application allows subscription user to send a signed request to poster user, then poster user signs a confirmation from poster key that gets sent back so that subscription users keychain gets a new unique key, others can subscribe to poster users poster key by same method allowing multiple people to decrypt, but limited to them only.

Dogecoin is merge mined by Litecoin. If Litecoin wasn't also mining Dogecoin, it wouldn't exist. So it will live as long as Litecoin does.  
But, Litecoin is the silver to Bitcoin's gold, and chooses to be in that position.  
This means that automatically it can be no greater than Bitcoin or Litecoin, sitting at a position of equal or greater than three, but then we have Ethereum that is a serious ecosystem itself and a coin, so it'll be in the top three.  
There's no doubt that Dogecoin has a future, but it's niche is a sidekick of a sidekick. It'll probably be whats used for microtransactions.

There are things with each topic of cryptocurrencies that I don't understand, but I do hold a very basic grasp of most, and a little more in others.
Thanks for your input.
Couldn't it be made that mining hardware or software report some signature (IP address, mac address, or some unrealized signature name) to a blockchain that acts as a registry to limit the amount of control on the network could be done from one location, but still allows the excess power to do like a subconfirmation. Or maybe a tier system where a piece of hardware makes less per hash over certain levels if it solved the next block. Or reward is lowered if it solved some number of blocks in a row.
Mining hardware is running software. Right now the difficulty to mine is super inflated beyond Joe Schmo. For security we need more miners. I assume that the network could operate the same if large miners were hindered, the difficulty scaled back down, then each person fired up a low hashrate miner. I can Mine from my phone/tablet right now through software (arm miner android app), both sha and scrypt, not profitable because of the large scale that pools and mining companies have created. If things were scaled down and someone built a mining wallet that allowed the user to choose how much processing power they would like to dedicate from small device, we would see an increase in security.
Even if the network could operate with one large miner, the risk we face is internet shut downs, countries putting up cross border firewalls. Even if the country put up a firewall then confirmations could come from within the country and later tie in the minor fork. The problem I see with Bitcoin is if a government wanted to hinder a population they could freeze all money exchanges by blocking internet traffic. But then someone could theoretically use a mesh network to bridge across these zones.
So I guess the subject becomes how do we stay connected to the one miner if that's all we have, or how do we manage subregions without access to the miner?

I personally see price control when watching the order books. I watched a wall disappear then a large purchase then wall established while adjusting smaller walls push it down.

This could be it's Achilles. Miners get less transaction fees unless rates go up which forces those to trade of the block even more. There should be a block trading incentive to combat businesses handling there own trades, or business handling these transactions should pay more in transaction fees to keep the balance.

I'm looking at it from the perspective what I would do if I was a whale. I would slowly buy in to keep price down. Dump some to drive price down, put a wall up, put a second wall up and leap frog the walls to drive the price down for my next buy and make sure it's a bigger buy than what sold by consequence of price forcing. I'm likely wrong and I like the explanation below about big mining operations having to sell. Care to share other ideas? I would like to learn more.

I think the final draw ("crisis") that'll push Bitcoin to the moon is when the feds try to go all digital, then push for cashless (effectively eliminating push transactions from USD), allowing banks to reach as far into negative interest rates as they want and there's no other alternative to/for garage sales, um I mean a cash like push system.

From what I see, the feds want to go digital.  
Negative interest rates have been a big topic, banks would like to go into negative interest rates but they can only go so deep if people withdraw their money. The only way they can push deep into the negatives is on a cashless society. I can't recall the article, but something would show up if googled.

Just a guess, but I'd guess we are in a consolidation triangle where aprox. 1166 is the peak and aprox. 730 is the low, our next high point we had just hit, so the next low should be around 870, with resistance at 918, so expect a turn around between 870-918. I know that's a wide range, but we were stuck at the low 900's for a bit before going back up. This was expected to occur since we had not had an elongated triangle consolidation period since the one in which the peak was around 789 in late June.

You would give $999 worth at the time of the transaction. Whatever happens to the price after is not your concern as much as it's not his concern what happens while it's in your possession.
Personally I would buy maybe 10% more in case the price went down from when you bought to the time of your transaction for item.
You can probably get away just fine at 5% though.
Figure it like this.
5% roughly $50
If price moved down by $10 per Bitcoin @ just over 4 coins, your coinage worth would drop by just over $40. If you had bought 5% more you would've had about $1050 to begin with and after price action just over $1000.
If the market moved up then it's no issue. You'll just have change for any future purchases or sell back.

You would want to get a bit extra just in case for price swings. Then you also need to consider the transaction fee for purchasing through a third party.
I would normally add 5% at a minimum to what I'm trying to get as my total in case the price dips, 10% if the markets been up and it's volatile.
I believe the fee is 2% for Bitquicks fee, then theres the sell price/bitcoin the person is looking to get.
Usually the more Bitcoins they offer with a higher minimum, the less the price is per Bitcoin. The opposite is true for the most part. The lower the minimum, the higher price/bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-18 17:18:18
Oh, in addition. If you transferred to a personal wallet, then to the vendor, then there's Bitcoins network transaction fee.  
Technically speaking the minimum for a transaction fee is 0 BTC. But then it can take a very long time to a very very long time for the transaction to be confirmed, do yourself a favor and just add 0.0001 BTC per transaction planned.

If all is well on the technical side and all I would look at would be the market, I MAY try to get others coinage that try to bail out by shorting.

But just like we've broken older encryption keys, the future may break lost ones now. I agree that we will lose Bitcoins along the way, but I feel that computing will develop to break old keys. This will probably be when most quantum computers are connected as a large distributed computer.

Then we face a possible inflation, all machine owners receive a piece of the "re-mined" coins.

(Assumption) Right now some players are keeping the price between $200-$300 range. This $100 range is more valuable than lets say $1000-$1100's 100 range because it has a larger percent increase (33% vs whatever technical but close to 1%). The intent would be to spook others into selling or losing it playing the game for them to acquire much cheaper. While many are somewhat comfortable not selling in this range. This is the ideal range to play games at.

The stochastic oscillator is the bottom one.  It takes a sample size from the last several trades to draw the line at its current point. 
In the sample it looks for the closing point between the high and lows. If the closing point is at the top for most of the trades it will be near 100, at the bottom it will be near 0. 
This gives an idea of overbought, or oversold. Usually viewed as over 80 it was quickly overbought, below 20 oversold.
 There are different scales that can be used that can show fast or slow swings. Sometimes you'll need to ignore it floored to the top or bottom for a bit before the reversal happens. 
You can actually see it change direction sometimes before the price does.
On these images the high point was getting progressively lower drawing a slant across the top. Being near the bottom it's saying that we are going to go up again. We will either see another cycle of the to slant down and to the right, another wave in price, up one down two or a complete reversal on price, a run up.
Usually I see the price waves have three distinguishable waves then sideways movement, making a fourth or fifth smaller wave. 3-5 is average, 7-11 happens.
The price waves
Don't follow the price very detailed, look at how it starts high and slopes down, wave 1, then it goes up and slopes down, wave 2, goes up slopes down, wave 3. Each wave getting smaller, weaker.
You can see the waves better looking at the macd, the one above the stochastic oscillator. Notice the highs of each wave decreasing in altitude. The white marks in the middle, the histogram, show the distance between the red and blue lines, it gets smaller each wave suggesting pattern/trend is weakening.
The RSI is relative strength index. I can't explain this as well but the way I see it is I view it from the middle, 50%. Above it is how much strength is pushing the price up against resistance, below it how much strength is pushing it down against resistance. It has a pattern that also looks like a bouncing ball getting lower and lower.
The way to view this all together is that we have a distinguishable pattern that is getting lower and weaker according to macd, the strength is down right now and so will bounce up again, then down while we are near reversal of price, stochastic oscillator being near bottom. The main guess lies in how many more waves we have before we are done with the downward waves. Looking at 3,5,15 minute scales you can see this bear pattern, then it moves sideways in tiny waves before we get either more bear patterns or switch to bull patterns.

Most users will probably be through third party for user friendly ability and for regulation. The U.S. Feds like the idea of a "digital value transfer" currency, but want one privatized to work back end of the current banking situation. So if Bitcoin became the currency of currencies, then it'll be regulated to force more users into third party.
Losses start to become limited once these third parties we see now become the regulated Bitcoin banks that keep backups of users keys.
At that point, the price doesn't matter. Imagine, what would be the USD price if the USD disappeared.
Purchase power is what matters. How many Satoshis is a gallon of milk? No conversion, just direct exchange.
The USD fluctuates regularly, but milk has a range. You don't stand in the store and watch the value of the dollar rise and fall and short milk. Yet, you technically can except for the price of milk isn't responding as fast as the market is moving.

This brings up a good point. Although the 'centraliztion' aspect is a good topic, but I'm currently curious what other consensus methods have been looked at that might work.  
If my opinion is sought after concerning block size and segwit. I honestly don't know the repercussions well enough to decide. But I see that segwit offers some benefits, and I believe that blocks that can contain more information (either by size or by compression) will allow more features to be built on top, but then we risk losing the 'dumb network' that makes it simple and powerful. Anyways, ADHD rabbit trail aside.  
  
I fathomed long ago that it would be cool if others can write their code, then it could be reviewed by the public and voted on. As a double check system, the code was then implemented in the main client, but then was not activated unless a majority vote decided. This entails that only one client exists and no developer can isolate anyones idea out or have the ability to approve a single idea into the codebase. Something to this affect would mean that decentraliztion begins at the development level on a single client all the way to mining. The main problem is how to implement a codebase that allows any submission and defining what consensus really means.  
As an example, consensus could be determined from addresses, or it could mean miners, or node operators, or a combination. Being a Bitcoiner, I would like my vote to count, but how can a person with less have an equal vote with someone with more.  
If it was address based, they could split their wallet further, node based, they could spin up more nodes, miner based, well that's a minority of users and I certainly can't compete there.  
This almost leads to a situation where a unique identity needs to be created, which limits how many identities a person can create to one, but then that's a privacy issue.  
My uneducated thought would conclude that a consensus system meant that there are different tiers of voting. Where a number of addresses that vote yes bumps it up to nodes voting, which bumps it up to miners voting, and miners can only vote between the options that made it that far, pretty much choosing one system or another without the ability to opt out of both and remain on the same client. A null vote as a miner would mean that they can't create valid blocks, forcing them to consider what was brought forward by the public.  
Of course that quick example is going to be full of flaws. I got my GED in prison, what do you expect. I'm not too dumb though since I did manage to get 4.0's in every class in college, but I'm no engineer. I'm just good at school.

With Wall Street stepping in, it'll cause regulations to be made.  
Yeah, there's a lot of a money gain aura wrapped around Bitcoin, but mostly from 'coiners. I think there's a view going around that Bitcoiners are just a bunch of people that want to undercut regulations and government, this then fits in with the criminal activity view that was predominant not long ago and may still be strong in a lot of circles. But that view will begin to fade once Wall Street continues to step in, but this'll only increase the "money is to be gained" view.

A generating sequence.  
If key generated has or had a balance, continue to generate until a fresh pair is available.  
As long as the generating sequence of how the keypairs are made, then it will produce the same sequence.  
In other words, everything is built up from the master. The master does not store anything, it's a start point. Other details are the details you put in to your transactions, which are stored in the nodes. So remember, don't put things into your transcations that you don't want others seeing. Other services may have a database that links other details to those transactions. So, if you sent transactions from their platform, node, and if you reload the wallets containing those transactions, details from that original association are still linked off-chain.  
Wallets are nodes, if your wallet doesn't contain the blockchain, it's connecting to someone else's nodes. Who then has the ability to know things like your i.p., times your wallet reconnects, possibly other info about your system and habits. So if you import other keys from non-associated coins, they'll still know that they can rely on associating it based on that profile. So if you favor privacy, you'll need to host a node, although, if done correctly and not tieing other wallets together, some privacy can be kept through TOR connections.  
Don't do what some do and push other data through the same TOR connection though, you know, like logging into some account.

Consider how watching an online video sends pieces at a time until complete or until you are finished.  
We have never had money that can stream specially at a micro size. With lightning network you can integrate services that stream money.  
Just a sample of possibilities. Imagine that you no longer have a monthly electricity bill, but instead, when you flip on a switch you stream the funds to pay it immediately. Likewise, your income can stream in each minute or second while you're at work, or your salary divided into the seconds of the month.  
With an app you can watch a comparison of total input and total output live and know immediately whether you are saving or overspending. Maybe you decide you want to budget in extra time at a vacation, so you add a budget amount to save to your app and a deadline. It then suggests methods to save money from your streams, and as you make adjustments to your spends it tells you how close or far off you are from your goal, live.  
**TLDR:** The main point I highlighted here was streaming money. The rest was one hypothetical concept.
@_date: 2018-10-17 14:49:03
Adding more miners doesn't scale more people on. A lightning node doesn't need to use much power, it can be an app on your phone. We can already scale globally with our current tech in Bitcoin alone, in it's current state. We can already does millions of transactions per second, through lightning and batching. The cost of electricity was always an option for miners, raise the difficulty and the cost to snuff out competition, it comes with the added bonus that an attacker would need to have at least that much money and electricity.
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:54:27
Your point and their point are not the same things. I doubt that if you looked at their business plan or mission statement it says "...handle mass traffic when Bitcoin has significant dips ... ."  But it probably has something like "... generate profit from providing a service where users can buy or sell ..." which can mean, shut down the site if we could lose money on significant dips.  So, they might actually provide the opposite of your assumption. Aaaannndd, this is just a logical assumption that I put forth since I don't have a copy of their business plan, heck, it could even state, provide mapping of identities to users of cryptocurrencies to nations. You must've been born after the internet because you act like you need immediacy. Go grow an orchard for a reality check.

**TLDR:  Key pairs will need to change. Old pair -&gt; New pairs if alive. Coins from old pairs will be harvested.**
As computers and technology increase in computational power and better algorithms are created, Bitcoin will need to move into another keyspace.  
In those times, you might even find companies that look like current miners that seek to "salvage" coins, possibly miners or large Bitoin holders now.  
It's not going to be tough to get a consensus to increase security and hard fork into a stronger algorithm, it'll be tough to agree on which algorithm. Meanwhile, "salvage" mining has already started.  
To get a feel of how far along methods have come to "cracking" sha256, here's a link to a section of page on the subject of sha-2's.  There is a loooong way to go to crack it. But it may not need to be cracked, just weakened enough to reduce the time to calculate within a reasonable time (reasonable time is relative, to some, within a lifespan, to others, multiple lifespans).     
  
  
Cracking sha256 may not be necessary. All that might be necessary is pattern finding and guessing. The more successes, input guess into algorithm. Machine learning may take care of this in a few years from now. To train a model, funds don't need to be in a wallet, I can start it's training with random key pairs. Checkout brainflayer to get an idea of "salvagers" that don't try to crack sha256.  
Brainflayer has gone beyond cracking "brainwallets" at this point,

The smallest unit will continually be one decimal place lower. There used to be no limit to the units, but the smallest unit was created to stop dust transactions that were being used to spam the Blockchain, back when there was no fee.  
Bitcoin is deflationary, after our deflating inflation period. The deflation period will truly begin when lost coins outpace created coins. Because of this, Bitcoin is infinitely divisible and never intended to have a smallest unit.  
Edit:  
I think I should add that a need to divide the coins also happens with population increase.

Have you considered that they can absorb transaction pressure through atomic swaps. One region may use this coin, accepted by these families of stores, and another region may use that coin accepted by another family of stores. If both coins have segwit and lightning, then you can travel and use whichever coin you had without the need to convert.  
This allows stores to create their own Home Depot in store credit or coupons, and Lowes in store credit or coupons, and a mall might have their own coin or token type. But the name would not matter if they were in tune with immutability, decentralization and swapability.  
Another scenario is a particular coin might be more suitable for data storage on chain, less transactions and large data, while another might be more suitable for proofs, many small data transactions.  
These altcoins become the load bearing, specific use case scenario sidechains to Bitcoin.  
We might see Bitcoin as the storage of value, Litecoin as the paycheck and day to day purchase coin. Then Dogecoin as the light-hearted barter at the garage sale coin. Digibyte as the formal filed paperwork coin. Namecoin as a digital mall. GameCredits as the dlc or microtransaction coin. All merged together into one ecosystem. Litecoin might serve as the intermediate coin between your savings account (Bitcoin) and your purchase, it may be the checking account of sorts, etc.

How does anyone know whether they were even hacked? To look at it from all angles, you must include that yes there is a potential they were hacked, but also that they released enough to look hacked. Then, if they were hacked, was it by someone that has the goal to scare people away from crytpocurrency (competing governments, regulators, buttcoiners, ...), or for the actual goal of profit, even though we currently see what is going on about the GOX and the ransomware coins. Also, could it be internal to HBO so they catch some spot light or create an excuse to buy Bitcoins .  
What's really surprising is that whoever was intelligent enough to hack HBO, must also be considered retarded to request a large sum of Bitcoins when there are more suited methods for this kind of action. This is why I call bullshit on the hack.
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:35:28
This is the most accurate answer here. The only reason they let Bitcoin get so far is because if they declared it illegal, there would've been some backlash. If they get to tag crypto with peoples identities, especially as less are mined and there becomes less miners the only source becomes the KYC, AML on-ramps. There are plenty of free tools to help track transactions and Universities have published articles on methods of tracking. Most crypto is not anonymous, it's pseudo anonymous. Once I know who you are, I can track forward and backward from that transaction to see where else you transact and how much. I just need to know who you are and KYC/AML is the answer from on-ramps, and paying utilities is the midpoints.  
Edit:  
In addition. Whenever you check your wallet balance your ip address is leaked unless you use your own node. But then sending doesn't broadcast your transaction instantly to all nodes and miners. With this I can set up nodes in different regions and listen for the order I hear about them and get a general direction of source. With enough transactions and the merge of change after a transaction, I can link different wallets to one and triangulate your location.

It's just meant to be another perspective. The dollar isn't inflating as fast as it appears because other currencies are bleeding into it like how it's bleeding into CryptoCoins. I didn't mean it as the ultimate truth.  
From another countries perspective, that gallon of milk is going up like crazy to their local currency, but up a tad with USD, and down with Bitcoin.  
Is the milk gaining worth?  
When measured with fiat it appears that way, but the true value of a gallon of milk is set.  The main difference here though, which describes what you point out, the true final value of Bitcoin has not been discovered, so it is going up, while we know what milk is good for and not already. So that's where my statement is wrong, until a point.

You are correct, as time goes on less and less old wallets will remain unmoved. At some point it will be easier to estimate the amount of lost coins and accuracy will increase each day. If we do have a switch over to a different namespace of addresses to mitigate computers becoming more powerful. You can get an accurate number of coins that are lost because of not moving. But at that point a miner of that era could be a lost coin reclaimer (treasure hunter).

Wow. Sounds like you have a decent chance to recover. Because if you knew all the words were in alphabetic order, then the checksum value would be greater than the eleventh word value.  
I haven't bothered playing with a tool like BTCrecover, I'd imagine that it has some scripts to make some of the tasks more efficient. But it sounds like your task is very specific that it may not be possible. But then again, BTCrecover may even have the ability to use a text file you generated, or some limiting rules beyond just entering your custom length word list. 
Writing a program to do this in python is not difficult.  
I'll write down steps I would take to try and solve this if I were trying to do it. I'll be back.  
Sorry about the delay, had some things I needed to handle.  
The words in the word list are represented by it's position, first, second, third, etc. but starting from zero as the first word.  These words are in binary form. So you will need to look up the word in the word list, get that index value and convert to binary, string these together except the 12th word. Take each of the possible 12th words and append the first bits, hash for checksum value, take those checksum bits and compare to supplied word, if it's a match, it's a valid seed. Take the valid seed in word format and pbkdf2 hmac sha512 hash it into the master private key. Then generate the first account and public address. Check address if it ever contained a balance and if not, iterate through next potential seed.  
You would need to know which wallet originally generated the wallet, because there are a few standards out there, Electrum earlier versions, later versions or Trezor, then just Bitcoin, or bip44 where there's a different standard that can do other coin types.  
This would be the basic concept, the steps can be done a bit differently. For instance, skip checking the checksum and just hmac hash it and check for history.  
You would need a function that will help to iterate, this isn't hard, it'll look kind of like a bubble sorting algorithm, but no sorting occurs, but the way the position pointers increment.

It isn't. Many don't understand that. Even a dollar value per coin can be seen as arbitrary, depending on situation.   
If someone intentionally placed a market buy of a million dollars per coin, but bought a millionth of a coin for a dollar, and everyone knew not to sell below that point, all coins would be valued at a million dollars each.  This would then create a very large market cap.  
If a coin was at a dollar, and you then decided to create 200 billion coins, the market cap would then increase by 200 billion dollars.  
Where it becomes less arbitrary is when you have many speculators competing on direction of value, and no entity, or family of entities with the ability to change the rate of supply. Then valuation can be built on speculation rather than manipulation, but it doesn't necessarily proof worth, it can, but it can also be evidence of over/under speculation.

Yeah, it'll be tough to do. I originally got the idea because I like to buy digital whenever I can. But I don't get the ability to resell or trade in the digital form.  
My next thought was, not only can someone trade in, which could be possible right now on some platforms, but it could be taken onto other platforms where others could bid on it. At that point I thought how cool would it be for an original author to use that new platform for price discovery. My ideas wasn't based on copyright protection, but it can't happen without it. I can't even fathom the right way to implement it and was hoping that one day someone will recall this idea and make some base that can utilize the blockchain so that one day we could have preowned digital products.

Anything below the next ATH is your opportunity.  This was drawing was used to illustrate a point. Point being that this pattern has happened with every previous ATH, so, it's a bit off. If you look at history, there's usually a quick dip after the triangles before the large rally.

I think you're missing the point. The original idea behind Bitcoin was a distributed network where anyone can mine, but an arms race made it so that only a few can afford to run. If you can point out how I can afford to compete against larger pools and miners while solo, then I'll gladly do so. If you can't point it out, then I can point out centralization.

We will have a peak. I wouldn't worry too much since Bitcoin has always followed a particular pattern, so we can expect to see somewhere around $2,000 if the pattern holds true for the fifth time.

I wish mining could have hash power capped so that others have a chance. With the goal to get more miners. This would give us better feedback on consensus. As it is now, with the fewer larger miners, it leaves room for speculation of manipulation, and possible manipulation.  
Imagine mining capped per pool, per ip, per region, per country, where miners above a certain threshold can be used to verify solved blocks only.

Just like the "U" shape move from the previous long held ATH until now, there will we another one following this peak. It has happened several times at the same shape but on a different height and width each time. The measurement of it's percent gain, should be taken at an average. Take this as advice, either dump early and start buying at every dip or hold through the trough and buy at each dip. The next cycle may be in years, or it could be more condensed. I believe it'll be years because money will move to other coins during this natural trough. So this means that getting other crypto while they are low now, is a good idea. Don't chase the market, lead the market.

Thank you for sharing this. It's not for me, but I can see the uses.  
For one, the last time I opened an account, they wanted my social security number and to do a credit check. A card like this opens up the possibility for those that travel to convert bitcoins into the major currencies when bitcoin is not accepted.  
I can see a person might send money to some relatives in countries where banking is difficult. Zimbabwe for example. A person can send bitcoins to a relative there, that then uses an app as such to convert to us dollars for spending. A difficulty in that situation though would be to find someone that accepts electronic payments. But that is solved with other fintech apps.  
Ideally, it would be nice for them to just accept Bitcoins, but, in a dire situation, this would suffice.

I just get worried that miners will reduce in amounts and it becomes easier for censorship to occur. There are two points of censorship that I think it could occur at, one of them being which client gets run (I'm not for one or the other at this point, just want the general population to have a say), the other by having a few targets to manipulate.  
If this were to be dealt with, it doesn't need to happen at the node side.  
There are others way this could happen. A made up example, a miners client is determined by a vote. But then how could that occur. Those who hold more wallets have more votes if it was done by transactions.  If it was done by nodes, then someone with an agenda could fire up more nodes.  
The main thing we lack as I perceive it is power to the mass.  
Probably the best way would've been a miner p.o.w algorithm that limited mining rig power. Changing that now though would make it so current miners take a big hit to their investments and difficulty would be so high that blocks would take forever to be created.  
This would then have a negative effect on Bitcoin, and open the idea that maybe one of the algorithms of another coin is better.  
My goal is to get the idea on the table for exploring a voting system for consensus. Maybe I was a bit too fast to say it's in nodes needing a reward.  
However, I do think that if nodes were to get a reward, then block size becomes less of an issue when it comes to purchasing memory and connection speed. But the idea doesn't solve the issue of latency of populating the entire network.

If you don't know the private key/address, then what's the public.  I want to know it for research purposes.  
Use this to look at your search history, if you've ever looked up your balance online.
  
Concerning using the private address, I'm familiar with the patterns and if I have an idea I can search in the range, I promise that I'd send you the final address on the condition that you transfer funds out and backup your wallet. But I can only do it if I had most of the characters.

You'll need to stop using your phone right now and connect to your pc and search for deleted files. Also, google/lookout does online data backup to help restore some, but not all, stuff.  
If you have an inclining of what the private key was then there are ways to search it out, the question is how much of the private key/address do you know, the more the better.

I wouldn't call it stolen when it was sent to a wallet that someone already has (in possession like as in owns) the keys to. There just happens to be many owners of the same keys.  
Would it be stealing if you stumbled upon the keys of "lost" coins and no one claimed it and you eventually recirculated it back into the system?  
Would it be stealing if you seeked lost keys out?  
Now, what if someone ended up owning it but never got the message because it was in cold storage, balance unmonitored.  
At what point does it go from being a service to the community to being theft?  
The point is, if I hold the keys then I'm an owner, and therefore if they were sent to my addresses am I a thief. Some will say yes, and those people should consider that it's the same as finding lost money on the ground.  
Would one call it theft if I found a penny and kept it, and compare that to finding $50 K, would that be theft?  
I consider them alike. At what penny in between 1 ¢- 5000000 ¢ does it become theft. What if I found the stash one penny at a time strewn across the city from one individual with a hole in his bag. Theft is the action of intentionally taking from another without permission. But if you send it to them, isn't that some form of permission.

I concur. It looks like it had a capital 'E' in the lower loop, which then sometimes makes the lower loop look like a 'D' once you see the 'E'. I feel that it also lacks the look of power that the double lines provide.  
This just needs to go to B 'E' 'D' already.

I wouldn't be able to recover it from public address, if I had that all I would do is just hang on to it as what I'm doing is building a table in a sample size of the keyspace to look for patterns that can be used to convert within a range, then to search that range. At this point I'm far off from a solution to that though. My idea is that one day the keyspace will expand and lost coins in the old keyspace will be searched and recovered through some mathematical shortcut process to re-enter those lost coins back into circulation.  
If you had a chunk of the private key or private address then that makes it much easier since those are sorted in an alphanumerical sequence and a person can narrow down the range quickly with each known letter.  
For instances the private keyspace goes from 
5HpHagT..........................................  
to  
5Km2ku............................................  
Which is a very large range  
the alphanumeric order is 
digits first
Capitals next  
lowercase last  
So, do you have any of those numbers/letters?

I don't know if you're pulling my leg or not.  
Many don't like to hear some of my ideas, they just criticize right off the bat.  
First of all, for reference we have what's called a private key, which can then be turned into a private address. We can either choose to work with the address or the key for our scenario. We also have a public key and a public address.  
Creating a private key is easy, it's basically a number from 1 to 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494400.  
(Usually created by doing a sha256 hash of some random characters  
 )  (**EDIT** - Leave input blank and compare hex value to blank brain wallet to secret exponent at  )
Which can easily be converted into a wallet import format (WIF) by encoding it with base58.  
base58 string = 123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz  
There are several steps used to take it from private key --&gt; public key --&gt; public address.
Knowing this, all are private keys are in sequence and the public addresses seem to be unordered.  
But imagine if you were able to list some of the public addresses in order from least to greatest, sequentially with no gaps (that's the table I'm building and I almost have a small section filled in, but to get enough may take several years, but it'll be worth it). Keep the private key associated with each public addresses decoded into an integer in a table.  The private keys will then look random. At this point is when you start to compare from pub address one to which pub address has the next private key in sequence (think of it like cross divide and multiply), then so on and so on, eventually you should be able to find a pattern that'll get you close to the range in private key, which then can be scoured in both directions looking for the key pair match, then you would use this result to find out how off your pattern was and readjust.  
I'm not claiming that I'll be able to find this in my lifetime, or that my idea is correct (I haven't even decided where my division by modulo/moduli are yet, need more data, but I have an idea), but I think that this will emerge as a major study, and eventually it will succeed to some degree and thus make recirculation miners become another industry. Meaning, whoever has the most data has a head start and may make or sell to the next industry of mining.

Insult others. Insults do not contribute to a rational discussion. Constructive Criticism, however, is appropriate and encouraged.
Yeah, it is. Can it provide cracking, yes.  
There's more to keys/addresses than sha256 though. I was pointing out that just hashing as sha256 isn't as safe as one thought, it was a matter of time before MD5 was cracked and sha256 is headed that route too. But nothing to worry about since there are other things needed to make a keypair, and the algorithm (read as steps in the process) is nowhere near being tabled or cracked.

To discern the "how many" we would need to also consider a time frame.  Assuming Bitcoin becomes the defacto cryptocoin; we already have a multitude of large holders that are invested in earning more through business and trade. We also have had burner addresses where people once intentionally sent coins to unspendable addresses to lower the maximum supply, as well as dust that was difficult to calculate a proper transaction fee, deaths, and not knowing but assuming Satoshi's keys were destroyed.  
I'm not going to bother trying to research any particular number's, but from the onset it would be 21 million people can own one coin and none greater. With all the loses, burns, deaths and large holders, this number becomes much smaller quite fast. Just assuming 18 million people out of 7 billion, I'd call that rare. There's probably more people than 21 million that have a "rare" condition.

To top it off, I got the ex-wife coming down my throat threatening court action if it isn't done and the doctor's office having stepped in wrote a letter to the court explaining that they are working on it and there's nothing I can do and no fault of mine.  Then, my mother has a co-pay of $1200 / month (maintenance dose of chemo meds) and we had to find a place that was willing and able to get her financial aid to help cover the cost. She also needed a wheelchair and it took two months and my wife and I had to carry her to and from the bathroom, bath, vehicle for appointments, etc. She had two falls early on when the walker wasn't enough anymore and now Adult Protective Services is investigating us for potential abuse while mom is telling them she had an accident because she didn't have her wheelchair.

Do you think its possible that it will self balance when more transactions can fit in a block?  
If that's the case, then we may see twenty-ish minute blocks, but the same volume of transactions processed.  
So my second question would be, if the blocks held more transactions, is it similar to a minor difficulty increase, more hashing?

Some general thoughts I have, and I'm no IT professional or developer. For those that'll fail to read my entire comment before commenting, I would love to hear your thoughts so I can consider counter thoughts for better assessment. Please don't be rude.  
One of the problems that I feel is being partially overlooked on the block size debate is the situation of how nodes and mining became separate. It's great that nodes were able to separate and allow that security to continue, it's bad that miners were able to scale the difficulty up so fast that the average person can't run a miner effectively (as I assume Satoshi imagined it would be).  
Now if nodes were to get a portion of transaction fees and/or coinbase rewards, there wouldn't be a problem of them paying for faster internet and memory.  Determining who and how much is another issue that would be debated, but I don't believe others out there disagree that nodes should get some share if they are long running, full nodes. 
On the other hand, network latency could still be a problem as there aren't similar internet connection options and costs around the world, miners get more time for first solvers advantage as network populates, which possibly adds to the chance of a single bad actor with major hashing power to manipulate the blocks with less than 51% of the hashing power.  
One issue that we have as a whole is, we aren't able to scale the miners down.  
I think it would be wonderful to scale mining back down where the average Joe can run a miner at home without so much overhead. Eliminating the race to hashing warehouses. Miners wouldn't like it though if in a sudden, their cluster of miners and pools were retarded down to one home pc. This would cause a huge uproar and a fork. But if it were put in place and succeed, you could see a spike in adoption as everyone is on the same level of playing field, but then, VC's might leave the scene because their trust on Bitcoin would be shot. Which brings us back to nodes as the area to protect from centralization.  
@_date: 2016-09-21 05:53:23
Yes. Simple to do. The tools exist. I could probably put one together in an hour. If you had some hints on each of the three words like length, or legible letters, then the code can scrape those words off the list to attempt words matching those hints only at first, then start trying the rest if it was not found.  
To you 0.2 btc might not be much, but to someone like me, I think the average citizen would be getting paychecks in sums smaller than that. So don't give up, specially since it's an easy task to automate.  
If you don't get this resolved by this weekend. Message me. I'll then write a code up in Python, if you can't understand reading it, we can post it online for review from the community to see if it's "safe". I can write it in a way where you then input the other 9 words yourself so that I don't ever see them.  
Honestly, I'd rather not work on it for free, but I'd hate it more to see someone lose that much Bitcoin on a trivial task.
@_date: 2016-09-09 18:38:24
You send bitcoins to one address, you initiate a transaction to another address with the same coins. Nodes are not in sync all the time, they eventually update, if the fee on the second transaction is higher than the fee on the first, it gets higher priority and gets confirmed, making the first transaction invalid. Keep in mind that since nodes are not always synced, the receiver can see the incoming transaction from one node, and another node might be handling the second transaction. I'm guessing that there is a chance both can be on the same node at once. But whichever gets confirmed first gets broadcast to all the other nodes. It can take some time for the node that receiver is getting his info from to see the second transaction and eliminate the first. This is why people refer to waiting for confirmations, the more confirmations the harder it is to eliminate, or invalidate the first transaction.  
On another note but similar topic. If a miner solves a block, it takes time to populate the network. The other miners then drop solving that block and begin on the next block after they know this new information. This then gives the solver a first movers advantage to solve the next block. If more than one miner solve the block at the same time and broadcast it, without knowledge yet of the other solved block, then whomever solves the next block, thus having a stack of two blocks or more if necessary, gets accepted as the longest chain by other miners.

Easier on the eyes, will be back later to post a solution, question though, are these in a file and you want to get from the file automatically, or do you want to enter each input?  
If they are in a file, how is it formatted. I can make a script that would take all info from a file, database or whatever and input all the info for you.  
What is the expected output, a line of text that you can copy or paste or a database?  
If database, which one.

It's part of what my friends are doomed to hear about from me.  Actually, I tend to have them ask about Bitcoin news. It's probably because I get energetic and start talking about it with my voice and body language very loudly. Then they act excited like they are proud to know me when other people jump in with questions.  
I always say that Bitcoin is great, but it has it's own problems, and the problems aren't that big, but will take a different mindset to comprehend, more likely with our children or grandchildren.  
I think that last statement makes them more curious. Maybe because I declare that I'm a Bitcoiner and am willing to say it's good and bad in the same sentence. No clickbait here. Just straight up truth about "potential issues".  
Please don't ask me what they are. They're just conspiracy theories in a sense, i.e.- The government doesn't want Bitcoin to go mainstream yet even if they wanted it, until they can map peoples identities getting on through approved on-ramps, making the IRS's job easier through digital monitoring that the regular person would have difficulty hiding from once they are paid and pay bills on the Blockchain.  See my point. Conspiracy's.

A chain of events recorded, dependent on each preceding block of events. It's with the intent to create immutability so that it can serve as a record.  
As a note, being public or private doesn't determine whether it's a blockchain. As long as it serves the purpose of being immutable, it can still be a valid blockchain. Being public helps to prove that it's immutable. But if one can show through code that it's truly immutable, it can still qualify.  
Immutability is difficult to achieve, hence the reason why Bitcoin is decentralized and public. It's so difficult to truly make that we even have a term for a situation where Bitcoin can become mutable, the 51% attack.  
We hold more validity to a public blockchain because if it was easy enough to create a privatized blockchain that was truly immutable without decentralization, we would probably have it in Bitcoin.  
This also brings up a point about alt coins being a test bed that can potentially lead to such a creation, and if Bitcoin doesn't adapt by then, there is a great potential for it to fade in favor of such technology.

They can't be the only ones. My brother had a million dollars show up temporarily in his Bank of America account, withdrew a few hundred. Later went in to cash a check and they kept that few hundred difference. When he argued back at them that he only withdrew from what was available balance, not his error but theirs. The employees response was that it's normal for them to move money into and out of accounts that the customer doesn't own and it was not his to withdraw. He then got audited by the IRS two years in a row, they claimed it was random audits, I doubt that though.

I imagine that if you looked at the stock value of a company after it goes public, and it rises after release, you can argue that when it was in one persons hands it was worth less than when it became tradeable. That's the closest model I can think of that sounds similar.  
But I think the goal to hold them all would not be for trading value, but for selling your book. But I don't think that's what you meant.  
I believe your train of thought is more along the lines of: if one person quietly scooped a majority up, with the intent of having a return. I think you can fairly do a limited comparison to Fiat in this regard. I'd argue that in Fiat land, we have not seen the true value of a dollar after inflation since there are large sums of value locked up. If all of the billionaires decided to move their value into the open market where it can flow freely, our supply would outstrip demand so fast the value of the dollar would collapse. Although this would truly be difficult since much of their value is locked up by one method or another. So if a person were to scoop up a majority of Bitcoin, I think it would have no negative affect as long as it was locked up in some way in service or assets. The rest can still be divided by lower decimal values. But if people were to determine that such person can unlock these coins easily, then there becomes a risk of this person dumping the coins. So in the end, the point of diminishing returns depends not only on the amount of coins owned, but also on how easily it can enter into the trading market.  
You can imagine it like, if one person scooped up 75% of all coins but did a timelock transaction were they couldn't replace by fee and locked it away for 100 years. There'd be no concern for most of that period. Now instead of using a timelock, it was used as part of a service where removing was near impossible because of some smart contract penalty for early removal. Or ... an autonomous industry.

21 million coins would need to equate to trillions of dollars. So if it became the global reserve it would need to be around 100 billion dollars each. But we'd likely see regional based coins with high value too and together they'd make that global reserve. Currently we do have several currencies that make the global reserve, so this is more plausible ( So with the big if in mind still, with shared reserve, at least a few billion dollars of purchasing power each at today's standards.

It wont work without a third party. Unless you made a POS system that allowed the POS terminal to sign the transaction. But this would mean exposing your private key to the terminal, letting it sign the dollar amount, but then where to send the change, it wouldn't be safe to resend it back to the card.

It doesn't matter how many coins are in an exchange. I give an extreme, but valid example.  
If everyone removed all their buy orders and set it at $1 USD, then someone sold 0.01 BTC into that price. The market price for all BTC at that exchange is $1.  
Similarly, if everyone removed all their sell orders and agreed to place the next sells no lower than $1,000,000 USD, then bought or sold at that price. All BTC's are $1,000,000 USD each.  
This shows that the motion of coins onto or from an exchange are not necessary. It just takes some trying to short, while some trying to get back in, then roles reversing. This can go either direction, up or down.

In a typical situation your system will create a large number, using bits (1 and 0'). This number will have a length of 256 of these bits. Any leading zeroes in the beginning of this number remain.  
Random example:  
    
    0111001111101111011010001100011001111101100010111100000110011110001100010010001001110010000100001000001110101010001010000000010100101101000011000001111101000101111000001111010011101110110101010010001111011011111001001001100011001011111101110111110101110100  
  
Every 11 bits are then used and converted to a number.  We will still need the original 256 bits to calculate the checksum.
These number are used to get the word from the list of words.  
In programming, and computer science, the first number when counting up is the zero.  
The wordlist has 2,048 words in the list, but we use the range 0 for the first and 2047 for the last.
If you count the 0 as one, then that's a total of 2048.  
After we have done that, we perform a hash of the 256 bits, convert these into binary and take the first 8 binary numbers. Take the last three numbers that remained, and the 8 bits and concatenate them, these 11 bits are then converted to a number and that element in the wordlist is now the last word, the checksum.  
This means that if we insert a word somewhere in these words, without the checksum, convert them into a number, then into binary, then take the first three binary bits from the checksum and append to end, hash, take the first 8 bits, these 8 bits should match the last bits of the checksums bits. If so, we have a match. We will have number of false positives, and eventually, one true positive.  
We just need to try every ith position, every word. Then with a list of all possible matches, we then concern ourselves with doing an hmac_sha512 hash of the words + passphrase if any to find the master private key. But since we are not building a full hd wallet, I'll stop with the process here.  
Others have pointed out tools to use. I'd likely use the iancoleman link someone else provided, saved on a flash drive, then opened up in a non-internet connected live-cd version of some linux system to test my words if I wasn't going to go the whole recreating an hd wallet route. Some tools most likely exist to help with these processes, hope this gives enough to see it through. If not, I'm willing to spend some time helping to guide or build you through this process.  
Not at any time will I ask for your seed words. Yes, this is solvable.

This is where I feel that second and third tier coins are going to help Bitcoin scale. Second tier being Litecoin and others I'm not familiar with, and third tier being Dogecoin, Vertcoin and others I'm not familiar with also, although Vertcoin might be a mid-level tier between second and third. With these coins utilizing Lightning Network and atomic swaps creating a coin ecosystem, similar to the tokenized system embedded within Ethereum, but not dependent on a main coin.  
We'll likely branch into having your savings, checking, store credit level, coupon level, and fan/brand level coins.  
For example. If you worked at Walmart, you'd likely earn Walmart Coins and might need to exchange it for Amazon Coins, but you may need to atomic swap it through Litecoin like an action clearing house.

No need to trust someone when you can view the generating code. Oh, but what if you can't read the code, ask the community. It is better to trust the community when there are developers involved that do review the code than to trust some unknown third party to delete a copy.  
It's also not hard to educate someone on how to look at the code that does the generating, also, it's obvious to someone that if a keypair is generated offline that it is safer than one the goes from their browser over the internet to some random person so they can delete it.

Well technically it could be less than one cent. If all sell orders were intentionally removed and buy orders were placed at one million dollars. Then someone initiated a buy for a penny. Then one million per coin would be the new price. And technically since this is an unregulated market, it's not illegal. We would just need people to agree.

Why isn't there a possibility of success.  
Couldn't this become the direction banks choose to go. They wouldn't need a block reward, they can still continue to "print" money. They would not be at risk of a fork. They can cut down the amount of middlemen. It's probably being developed to transfer faster. Banks would do the fulfillment of such financial transfers as outlined in the smart contract.  They benefit more by adding smart contract handling to their repertoire.  
This does have a potential to hinder Bitcoin's growth, banks that may have eventually stepped into publicly trying bitcoin may decide to hold off, keeping that potential of what may cause mainstream growth to not come from banks announcing their utilization of bitcoin.

It's amazing how many people can't read a comment within context. Hey  dude. I understand everything you just stated. For the laymen.  


Saying, hey look back a little further to 2010 and see if you still call it devalued.  


In essence stating that if you say it has devalued at this point you likely bought at the top. This also reiterates point one.  


Rubbing in the ignorance that this CEO dude has, kind of left field but not totally, if CEO dude can't look at the whole when it's in front of his face, then he likely makes other mistakes and could potentially be a risk.

On another tone, be aware that if you do consume a lot of electricity beyond what's reasonable and it causes financial harm, they may have grounds to go after you. For all I know, you shut off the heat and/or AC that came with the place and are using the miner instead, which wouldn't look that much different on their utility bill.

Rhetorical question. What is there to launder with money that you earned and put in a bank? If it was dirty, why start trying to hide it by putting it in your name in a system of records before trying to clean it?

Bitcoins missing app is, automatic bill pay.  
My electricity, water, etc. fluctuates while a few remain constant. I can approve them to withdraw from my bank or charge my card.  
I feel that it will be easier for others to transition into bitcoin if their wallet allowed them to:  
Go to electric, water, whatever company website, under pay bill they click pay with bitcoin automatic. Then site requests signature which can be a unique key associated with your wallet. Site pings wallet, wallet asks for confirmation to send to companies wallet.  
In your wallet you can group addresses, each group will contain it's own change address and act independently, thus limiting the withdrawal associated to any address in that cluster.  
What'll be nice is if they can add an encrypted confirmation number to the transaction.  
One of the problems I see. There are possibly more, programming, cryptography, financial sector are subjects that I'm unfamiliar with or I would've made this already. This can be a leak into theft if the companies database gets compromised, if the company goes rogue and exit scams and claims they were hacked, etc. So a 2fa would be nice by getting a text, email, or app to request confirmation, sent from your wallet, with an attached signature from said company.  
This might work better though if there was a sidechain where companies and individuals can make an identity and plug those keys into their wallets, being able to use this key on multiple wallets if they need to change their wallets.

Bingo.  
I must say that once upon a time I was not for or against Segwit but was for block size increase "for the time". I left my opinion open for figuring it out on my own. In time I came to understand it and can say that I am for Segwit, and it appears like somehow these devs are from the future, making Bitcoin be what it is supposed to be.  
When I go through the messages from the non-segwit side. (I'd say big-block supporters but that isn't accurate really, 'cause I can see a need in a bump.) There's so much contradiction on what they want. But what doesn't change is their attack on anything Core related. What they really want is a takeover. Lets say Core did what they wanted, I feel they would attack it because it's not their real agenda. Getting rid of Core devs is. Somewhere in all this, you know the Feds are putting pressure so it can self collapse, that way the Feds don't look like the bad guy shutting it down.

I had this happening to me with Keybank and Wells Fargo. Now I'm with a credit union and they do it in the order I do it in. I can deposit my checks and pay my bills the same day, no holding funds. One time did a check I deposit bounce and they charged but waived a $25  check bouncing fee. What's funny is that when that check bounced, it technically put me as overdrafted but I didn't get an overdraft fee, yes they do them, I recently had an overdraft the weekend of Columbus Day. I thought my balance was accurate and I paid more into a credit card and it turns out that it took Fred Meyer's Jewelers a week before they handled my payment, it didn't even show as pending. Irked me that they waited and I thought it was free and clear by then.

It depends!  
Law enforcement: "Why do you have so much cash, are you selling drugs?"  
Banks: "You have to trust us cause I say so." Meanwhile bankers are on the news for foul play.  
Banks are FDIC insured, I have no insurance with a place like coinbase.  
Now I wonder, if I held my own keys and my place goes up in smoke. Would homeowners insurance cover it? I actually do keep an encrypted backup offsite just for reasons like this and others that I may not be able to fathom.  
Keeping some at a place like coinbase would allow me to quickly exchange it for USD to pay certain bills if needed.  
Keeping some in my own wallet would secure me if the third party exit scammed or went down for a time or indefinitely.  
The answer is complicated, for me, do both just in case if they screw up or I screw up.

If there was a backdoor, I think I would prefer it to unlock by a condition being met such as if address number 2 has input from address number 1.  
You just need to control address 1 and 2, or at least address 1 if you want to perform the unlock yourself.  This way it can be programmed into the blockchain and not into a wallet and anyone that wants to unlock it will have a way more difficult time brute forcing it.

I'm simply stating that it is more profitable to buy and sell when the value is low, which is why large players would be interested in keeping it low.  
If I had a million dollars to play with it, I can shift the market around with pump and dumps.  
Small pump; small pump: others start getting excited and make a purchase; small pump: excitement increases and others purchase more to move the price higher than my last purchase; dump.  
This affect is greater at lower values, plus my profit is way higher.  
Correlating days means nothing.  
An increase from $1 to $8 is a 700% increase added to my base. But the same $7 increase at $1000 is minuscule in comparison.  
It's the same math as why a 10 year old is 1/3 of the age of a 30 year old, but then 10 years later is half the age.  
10 + 10 = 20  
30 + 10 = 40  
  
20/40 = 1/2  
The upper limit shifts.

It doesn't need to be cheaper, faster, or better. It just needs people to think, "Why should I use Bitcoin, this is the same technology." They also don't need the security of decentralization, and thus no miners, no difficulty level and no coin. Their blockchain would represent dollars. They will combine transactions into a block and hash in the previous block header to confirm those transactions and use that to settle debt between banks/accounts. It'll be a way to add trust to the current relationships. They'll settle their debt between them as usual (the usual time waster) but your account will reflect the change of balance much sooner. They'll know if a check will bounce much sooner by looking at the other banks blockchain and your balance will be more secure if they honored that amount in your balance immediately.

Bitcoin is the next generation control state. If it became fully accepted as global currency, miners would have to register and every on ramp into getting bitcoin would be kyc/aml or earned by an employer and all reported to the government and scripts would monitor peoples transactions and there is no hiding who knows who and spends what at where all recorded on an immutable ledger known as the blockchain. There would be no such thing as unmontiored spending. These on ramps would deny working with you like Coinbase already does if they think that down the line the coins are used illegitimately. That last part is censorship and control. Bitcoin can create the system of full control and censorship. Now comes the naysayers that don't understand that we already have tracking scripts used in social media, and the immuatbility nature of bitcoin to downvote to oblivion.

They'll steal if they can, but they rather have cash. I was approached by someone wanting to sell for cash, in negotiations I got them down to 50% of price on market. That's when it dawned on me that there must be something illegal going on. They were to willing, and whenever I got a message it was written as if from a different person then they had to confirm with there partner if price was okay each time I made a lower offer. After I caught on that something was fishy I decided not to engage. They may not have been associated with terrorists, but the little clues like usernames, always communicating through a different method as to break up the conversation, language structure, sometimes through profiles that had images of different people making it feel like hacked accounts.

If the coins had ever ran through the aml, kyc ecosystem, they're already being tracked continually. Only mined coins, traded privately can still be anonymous.
If your intent was to never pay taxes on capital gains. Too late. But then if you never reported it and the tracking system grew, you'd never be able to spend it on legit services in the future without being identified.
Unless, you're going under the table. Then I would suggest shapeshift out and back in to another wallet address that's not tied to any of your devices. Don't view the site from any of your devices/ip. Setup your wallets offline that you'll use. Break up the amount to different wallets done at different times. Make an initial transfer first to another wallet prior to this process. Now you can chain you were hacked and someone stole your coins and tried to run it through a grinder to hide it. Capital loss, in case you ever catch him and he returns it.

How much power or control does a malicious person/group have, or, what are some good measures to ensure transactions relay and get accepted before someone has an opportunity to be that nuisance?  
Where can I learn more about Segwit?  
Edit:  I found out more info and found your link below. I'll leave my question up as context though. Thanks.

Margin calls. When someone does leverage trading, they are putting what they have as collateral to borrow more. If price moves away from the direction they are betting on, the potential loss increases. Once the loss nears the value of their collateral they get margin called. If they are going long, betting for a rising value, and it moves down, each coin loaned and the collateral decrease in value, in order to close this position and recoup the cost of the decrease value, the coins get sold, further decreasing the market possibly triggering other margin calls as a domino affect making prices plummet fast.

Ironically I was thinking on a subject similar to this two nights ago.  Imagine how powerful a company like Google would be if they went beyond your browsing and social media habits, but where able to scrub through everyone's bank and credit card statements. Blockchain technology is the beginning of this.  
If a person where to begin mapping these transactions now, and as large adoption occurs, determine large corporations and utility company wallets, and continue down the line getting into smaller companies, eventually mapping at most of the space that can show when and how long and where the average person earns, spends and stores their value. This person can then sell this information to companies and create more focused ad targeting, as well as knowing more about illicit goods. I know many don't want to hear or think about this, but this new blockchain mapping industry could and would likely sell this information as a service to the irs and other government entities, based on proprietary mapping algorithms, like GM sold vehicles to the military. Heck, if I made it and was subpoenaed to provide this information, my argument would be that the blockchain already has all this information publicly, but my proprietary algorithms, money and time spent mapping is my own work like other companies creating physical goods for the government. Basically I would fight it and ask to be paid to give the information because it isn't user generated, but self generated.  
Anyways, my point is that there is going to be an industry for this information, for public and private entities. The first ones to get the early and all subsequent information mapped out has a head start by gigs of data that continue to grow. Someone that tried to start mapping from scratch in ten years from now has too much information to process to catch up, possibly taking a year to map from beginning to then current running into having to download, process and store in the terabytes range. But if you started now, all you would be concerned in doing is fine tuning your algorithm on test storage.  
Faucets. Bitcoin faucets have the potential of being start points for simple user mapping. What's nice about these is that a person can recoup the cost of injecting "tracker" satoshi's into peoples wallets through advertising. Then as these people spend and exchange, all this is watched, which allows the faucet to fine tune the ads and promote this to the advertising companies to charge more.  
If you think that tumblers protect users. You're mistaken. They only server to obfuscate to a degree. But if regulation passes, these private databases can determine who send their coinage into a tumbler and these people will be put on a watch list.  
Think about this. If an on-ramp into bitcoin, like coinbase for example, sold you bitcoin and took USD as payment, but then if USD were to loose value, possibly disappearing, what gain they have. Yeah they take profit now, but the millions of dollars they would lose on the collapse of the dollar would significantly hurt their pocketbook, but their tracking ability would save them. That is the goal of on-ramps, mapping all beginning points as users adopt bitcoin. This is where their real value comes from. But Coinbase is going about it all wrong by acting like the right arm of the government instead of a private company selling to the government. Furthermore, tumblers may become illegal, and users of them would be narrowed down, those coins deemed to be unspendable because it would be illegal to accept them, until either you are forced to turn them over and they get washed from the illicit goods market and reentering circulation through acceptable means (auctions or large dispensers).  
Call me paranoid, but I think not. Having an immutable and mappable ledger of everyones transactions is a dream come true for large companies and governments. If I was a government, I would spend research money in doing this if at the least, although there are greater reasons, for tax purposes alone. Any early investment into this would be fruitful as it would last many generations. I believe this is what is holding bitcoin back from going mainstream. After it is found how to map and monitor in a fashion that can scale, then the largest governments would adopt it and then set regulations accordingly causing wide spread usage.  
Disclaimer: I have adhd and have trouble keeping my thoughts moving in a linear path, excuse the mess please. I think my point is in there somewhere. LOL.

Bitcoin is more profitable for trading with a lower value than a higher value. For example.  
Let's say bitcoin was a $1,000 and litecoin was at $1. If I put $1000 into bitcoin, I get 1, if I put $1000 into litecoin I get 1000.  
If litecoin moves up by $0.30, my litecoin would be worth  
1000 * 0.3 + 1000 = $1300  
Thats a 30% increase. In order for bitcoin to give a 30 % increase in value of coins, it would need to move to $1,300 per coin. Three hundred dollars is a harder push than 30 cents.  
This isn't bitcoin and litecoin specific, it pertains to all markets. If Bitcoin was $1 this remains true. Basically a market with lower value has more gain potential.  
For investors, this means eventually they would like to manipulate price down to increase potential future gains at a higher pace.

Check out   
Choose an amount, choose a bank. Go to bank in that network, sometimes ID and sometimes not, depends on banks policy, upload image of receipt. You're not waiting days for verification. They hold the funds in escrow, so they'll send as soon as someone verifies the receipt upload, takes less than an hour all around. You can walk to the bank and before you get home it's in your wallet.

Investors are buying and selling all the time to make money. Each with their own pattern and reason, so it'll be impossible for me to list even a small fraction of methods.  
One that I like to think of though, if I had market moving wealth. I would buy in waves to create visible patterns on the charts to build hype and let the others buy in and raise the value. Then I would sell and dump. Leaving them high and dry. When I've exhausted the hype of rising prices, then I would dump and let FUD drive the price down further to buy cheaper coins. This would even work better at certain events that create sentiment. The halvening for example. If I see the sentiment that prices would rise, then this is an easier time for me to create rising patterns.  I'm not saying this is what is happening though, this is just what I would do if I could.

I beleive your account was outlaw or the outlaw or something to that affect at that time. Since then this account has been deleted. I recall the BearWhale needed to pay his taxes and had to sell some and that he had also been drinking. I had saved some of these posts and messages and am digging through them now. I see one that says deleted as the username but know for a fact that was the message. Can you show anything referring to that account for further authenticity.

The more negative it is, the more likely we are at bottom. The more positive it is, the more likely we are at top. Use this as a super power, like, when you want the next lane over when driving, stopped at a light, you accelerate quickly, the other person tries to match, you hit the brakes and take the gap behind them. You just manipulated their greed to get what you needed.   
Here though, you'll throw out a few different bait posts, one semi positive and another semi negative. Compare these comments to others', now they become a tool, and you're in control.

Maybe we should write one then. It isn't hard to plugin to Coinbase. The hard part would be to make certain the database is secure, which isn't difficult if gone through carefully, and filing to be a money transmitter if necessary.  
I would say the last part would be the hardest for me.

Given that his prediction was that it would hit 650 in June, then in July on this day hit 650 again with whatever events happening in between that would bring it to 650 again for some unknown reason, but rally from a low of 650 up.  
He's probably basing it on this idea I drew up. Not from my drawing of course. But the difference in this being able to rally like "The Bubble" is the bubble was artificially inflated by Mt. Gox, says the rumors. So a rally that would follow suit like before wouldn't be as strong of a climb.

Wouldn't you buy when there's blood in the streets and sell when everyone is overly ambitious. I did sentiment analysis before, and my thought was to identify tops and bottoms according to bottoms have a lot of negatives and tops have a lot of positives.

If Bitcoin had a Trojan horse aspect, it would be brought about by coin tracking until they've all been marked for monitoring.
