Since it's all blockchain based you could try and contact exchanges with other victims to check of one of the addresses, where the funds went through, belong to them and catch the thiefs and have their identities with it at the same time.

Those USB Miners aren't that stupid at all. Back then you could do a lot with it!  
See it as some kind of piece of Bitcoin history.  
  
10 BTC: Who could have known that things would escalate this quickly and insane.. Ask the guy with the pizzas paid in Bitcoin.  
Btw: I had my USB miners running last year for the fun of solo mining and trying my luck at it! Didn't get anything I think but was quite fun anyway. Only thing getting on my nerves has been the fan(s) which I was constantly getting my cables/hand stuck in, because I ran it at the front-top USB ports of my PC.

Only waiting for their verification. I might move from Kraken to Bitstamp. Kraken takes weeks to unlock my 5 fig. account (randomly banned for no reason at all) so I can check if their site works again or pull out my money. For now I move my trading elsewhere.
Btw Kraken staff on reddit: Ticket  for number for privacy reasons). Msg'd you guys everywhere + escalated the ticket several times, sent you guys my ID photo and everything long time ago. How long can it take to unban my account which you guys banned for no reason at all? Not to be rude, but... weeks? Come one.

- move
- mix the btc so my new btc are not traceable anymore (which takes a lifetime, but I‘d mix as many as possible)
- split the btc to many wallets
- dump them slowly so the market absorbs it nicely (takes a lifetime too!)
- live a nice life, probably on my very own island.
- donate some of the money
- build some own businesses with the money
- if some regular people ask where my wealth comes from I‘d only admit having 500-1000btc from the early days, never admitting the 1 million btc
- if any financial authority asks about the source of wealth I‘d tell them that someone who might be satoshi donated me 1mm btc without any reason at all, but I‘d let them sign a non disclosure agreement first before telling them
—&gt; all problems solved. I‘d still have some of the original coins which are unmixed in my wallets (and which I would not spend/sell) but I‘d be fine with the mixed ones  
  
OR: I‘d try to anonymously (however lol) sell them if they are satoshi‘s coins for a premium because the coins are the first uncirculated bitcoin ever. OTC. somewhere. to some people who own exchanges or something. Or I‘d archive some of the satoshi coins somewhere safe without selling them because they are the rarest of rare btc in existence! I don‘t know.  
  
I‘d never try to daytrade or swingtrade with them, even if I could crash the market at will. Just slowly selling *some* of them. But I‘d proably donate a lot to charities and to people on IRC. And to friends and family of course. If people I know get them for free they have no incentive to steal them. And for long term holding I‘d split some of the coins to a hw wallet and some to naked addresses I know the privkeys of and store them in a split up way in different save locations. Just to make sure no one can get any of those coins. (not in a bank vault that‘s for sure)

If you must download from the Google Playstore, I would recommend using Eclair. I have used it before and have not lost a single satoshi.

Take a small 2 day vacation from own leftover 100 bucks or something, then come back, realise I don't know what to do, talk to doctors if this is a dream and then maybe wake up with a 0 balance again.  
No really, I'd pay some debt, see that my little one has a bright future, buy myself a place to stay then and complete my gaming collection. And what not. And of course hand some to family.

Easy solution, use the blockchain to show them it is your account, and that from the current IP you are mailing them and show them a transaction made from your wallet you sent your 3 Bitcoin with so they can see.
Also ask them to whitelist the other 2 IPs of you.

Legit question, asking myself the same when I read threads with amounts like this.  
I personally totally freaked out about my first bought Bitcoin and secured the shit out of it. Went full tinfoil mode and made paper wallets. Still proud of it. Friends are laughing at me tinfoiling and shit to create my paper wallets but in the end I have the last laugh because it's secure.  
  
Also used the QT client as an experiment loaded with BTC for a very very long time with a very weak passphrase. Just to check if my online behaviour get's my system infected. Nothing happened.  
I used everything you can imagine, TeamViewer, E-Mail clients with infected spam mails and stuff, used Dropbox, had everything that usually is just a big no-go for regular users. Still didn't get ripped. Why? Because it matters -how- you use your computer and who has access to your system. Don't be naive and click any link you see. Just act like your computer is your personal bank vault.  
  
I'm proud and happy to teach new people what "secure" means as a Bitcoin user. At least I learned from the guys on IRC and reddit how paper wallets are meant to be created, which was the most important thing. Anyone who has money in Bitcoin should just go and ask on IRC, reddit or other places. Asking is free, getting ripped costs you all your Bitcoin in a worst case.  
  
Also paper wallets are just as secure as the person that has them. If you tell many people about it and happen to live in a highly criminal area, consider creating honeypot wallets. Just to mention this as an example.

When Bitcoin reached worldwide adoption, which no one knows if that's going to happen, you don't have to think about what your Bitcoin is worth in USD/EUR/YEN. Because then we have reached the final so called "1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin" goal.
Until then you may speculate on the price with it or simply instantly convert to your fiat currency of choice without any loss at all.
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:39:23
I also have many people trying to scam me. I always play around and discover some of their latest methods. When I see clear signs of a scam I just waste their time and have fun with them by asking dumb newbie questions over and over again about how to start a wallet client. Or letting them photoshop long ass sentences on a piece of paper from pictures of random people on the internet holding it to their webcam. As soon as they can't provide 2-3 more webcam shots, that prove it's legit, most scammers want to give up.
This is the point where the hardcore creative stuff comes into play, because you are still willing to give your xxx btc a random scammer on IRC. Of course. And he is doing everything what you want. So don't give up. At that point you might want to get a bit more creative.  Because if you are lucky you may have some extra quality fun after the first 1-2 hours. Do everything to annoy the shit out of these bastards. Maybe if you have some amateur infront of you, go teach him a lesson. He might stop trying to scam people.
Just to get them mad after an hour or so, have fun watching other friends on IRC get to them and waste the scammers time. Until he noticed that this community isn't filled with idiots.
Nice is also letting 2 scammers trying to scam each other without knowing. No idea how to let that kind of masterpiece happen. But you get it. Fool them back.
When you know you have a scammer infront of you and you decide to waste his time for being a bad guy - it's becoming a pleasure.
 
Remember: Only do this when you are 110% sure you have a scammer infront of you. Experienced guys know to quickly spot the signals. And then let the games begin.

Yes, but the problem still remains with all other alt crypto currencies for the EUR price.
I need to document the block reward of every single pool mining transaction. Calculating it by hand from x Coins to x USD to x EUR would be way too much of useless work. Especially when you mined some coin early with millions of coins and countless transactions.
 
I know that there's already a website existing for US taxes. But crypto currency fans like me from Germany are still pretty fucked.

I have endless BIP38 wallets flying around. The real ones are far away in another location.
**Here's the ultimate plan if you may be afraid of getting robbed or having them seized:**
Create "fake" BIP38 wallets. Change the qr code of your public adress so it scans like it's fully loaded. (Photoshop or Gimp will do just fine, takes 2 minutes) But it has a useless private key printed next to it which just gives access to an empty wallet.
Seal it, do this multiple times with different adresses and put em in plain sight in your house.
 
Make sure to let 1 or 2 trusted persons know about it in case if you pass away. This can happen anytime to anyone. Don't leave your family with money they can't access.

Tested importing a few keys too, works great.
For my unclear last part: Just figured it out myself. Was just too confused and didn't sleep enough.
 
Playing around with test amounts of BTC for Armory soon. Have set up my wiped HDD and starting to test it out with 2 machines soon.

Just ignore him, this is a troll post.  
  
OP: Respect for having a tattoo like this, needs balls!  
I personally am too afraid of getting a tattoo at all. I'm that creative kind of guy who get's bored of his own work after a short time. Also don't have the balls for tattoos, so I'm not that kind of guy for it.  
  
Some might tell you this was a dumb idea to tattoo the Bitcoin logo on you. But I think you had your reason. Just roll with it, ignore people who are throwing hate at you and be happy! And if you're happy with this, hell yes - congratulations!  
  
You know, I see people wo get the usual stuff like butterflies, chinese words and tribals tattoed and wonder why. But then I remember that it's everyone's own choice and that not everyone has to be happy with things that others do. Respect is everything. OP: Upvote. Commenter above me: Downvote.  
  
Pro tip: If you still find yourself happy with it in a few years but think it needs a little something to freshen it up: There's plenty of space left *within the logo* for ink in a few years. For coloring it or even placing artworks in and around it. (Costs a lot of money but also worth it if you find the right artist.)  
Worst case: You don't like it in a few years and can get it hidden by placing a different tattoo on top of it. Or lasering it away.

With BIP38 you can of course expose your *encrypted* private key, because it's BIP38 protected.
 
Can't stress this enough in all threads. Use. BIP38.

As I wrote in my other comment minutes ago: The AppStore version is infected. No idea how, but it is.

Let's get some things clear:
 
1) Everyone from the Bitcoin community knows who he is.
 
2) Running away with some leftover coins is easier as an anonymous guy. (As happened in the past. Claiming being hacked and stealing everything.) We also have the blockchain and currently many people digging trough the past while sweating blood and screaming this mans name. Time always tells the truth, let's stop freaking out and show patience.
 
3) If the coins that are stuck/lost won't come back, we all know who never ever will run a business with success again. Not even the shittiest Starbucks rip-off store would hire him. I guess they would be afraid of losing everything or having shit stolen month by month.
 
4) If Mt.Gox is back in 2-3 weeks, missing coins are paid out and stuff is going back to regular business - well... Everyone would instantly pull their coins out and Karpeles can close Mt.Gox anyway.
 
No matter what the next days bring to the light, Gox is done. Finally. And Karpeles is done too. With people being financially hurt - some more or less, we are watching the last chapter being told within the next days/weeks.
 
5) Finally: Forget every Ad or Press Agency out there, the golden communication award goes to Mt.Gox.
 
I don't have anything sitting on Mt.Gox, but I feel bad for those who do. Hard times guys. Keep it up, don't do something in real life that might be one of the worst decisions ever for you and your family. Life _will go on_. Trust me. Sounds stupid being told from some random guy. But Bitcoin evolved because of the idea and community. And we should stick together in good and bad times - no matter if you are a big or a small fish.
 
Shit that might happen behind closed doors sucks for the whole community and the reputation of Bitcoin. Just don't give up and carry on, please.
 
 
By the way: Fuck you Mark, no matter what your next masterplan of a statement will be.

Use BIP38 to protect your wallets.
The secret passwords to unlock your wallet's private keys have to be manually written down own paper. If you digitalize and store it or copy it - well, that's a risk of losing everything.
 
**Write the passwords down. It's god damn important.**
 
You will sleep much better.
 
If you are not familiar with creating Paper Wallets that have protected private keys: Order Canton Becker's Ubuntu Live CD ( which has the generators built in. Unplug all your HDDs, unplug your ethernet cable, insert the CD, boot, create the paper wallets with "BIP38" protection, **write these BIP38 passwords down on paper (don't store them on your computer or copy/print them!)**, create the paper wallet .PDFs and copy them to a brand new usb stick --&gt; Now nobody can empty your paper wallets because the private keys are BIP38 "password protected" and only you know the passwords. Because of this you can easily print your paper wallet PDFs on your unsafe machines.
 
This is the easiest method for creating BIP38 Paper Wallets. If you don't protect it with BIP38, you will face more stress creating them and protecting your private keys.

Some people hear about Bitcoin related to the word "blockchain" the first time from some mainstream media. So they might google blockchain since it's the tech used which mainstream media talks about. So a user knowing nothing about it besides those two words Bitcoin and blockchain has *no* responsibility at all to first google nights and days for reputation, check spellings, reports on forums and check this and that. Experienced or advanced users may have other knowledge and responsibilities, sure. But all in all it's the websites responsibility to prevent scam duplicates and the search engine's to process reports. See my other comment in this thread. Hint: DMCA reports can be applied for these things. Only needs BC.info getting their shit together.

***ASICs are not the reason why there's mining centralization. Economies of scale and non-uniform pricing of  electricity are the reasons.***  
Highly varying prices everywhere are existing, true. But it still is not the reason. It are ASICs and people who can afford them, the electricity is secondary. Big mining farm operators know about the electricity fact *before* they set it up - without stealing electricity. And even if your electricity would be free, you would have no way to compete with them, because no one can financially mess with the huge piles of money put into farms. Those already would have set up mines themselves. People not being able to have their computer running midly/long term would not go into permanent mining anyway. Still no victims to industrial mining anwhere then. Reason of centralization still is that groups and single persons right now run it because they *can afford buying and maintaining(!)* these ASICs. While there also may be a few persons or groups having the funds to buy into it but not the electricity rates to run it. There is a 100% chance that the majority of people in the world will never get to afford a mining unit, not even talking constantly upgrading. But that *would be history anyway* with said concept. Things would even out to a healthy level. Read carefully. Explained conceptual network rules would even everything out automatically. You could try as hard as you like, you won't just get to *beat it*.
 
***As long as we're using a proof-of-work consensus system, only about 5% of the world will have access to competitive electricity rates (≤ 5¢/kWh). It doesn't matter if we're using GPUs, CPUs, or ASICs: people like me who have industrialized mining operations will outcompete hobbyists.***
Not true. You need to realize there is not any kind of industrial type of scale in mining possible with my previous stated rules. It's just impossible. Also right now it's called PoW but in reality it's Proof of Centralized Mining Power. Nothing more. The whole system did apparently go the wrong way, people can cherry pick numbers all they want, ignoring other more important facts speaking against the whole Bitcoin concept - it is like it is.  
  
***ASICs that are specific to that cryptocurrency are significantly more secure than general-purpose devices, especially CPUs.***  
Wrong too. First, if you have read the white paper and know how the network adjusts itself, you would know how it works in terms of mining and security. Just saying out of nowhere that "ASICS [..] are significantly more secure" is just wrong in so many ways.  
First there would be no more ASICs, they would be useless old electronic devices. Second there is no *being more secure* comparing overall network strength of CPU and/or GPU mining vs ASICs. It even itself out, period. Read about it, it is what is active right now, self adjusting. The overall network hashrate matters. Having a CPU or GPU submit mining work data is no difference and *not more or less secure* than having an ASIC do it - there's big logic missing. 
  
***With algorithms for which general purpose devices are competitive, we get problems with botnets. Botnet operators have perverse incentives. Botnet operators don't pay electricity fees, so they're willing to waste more value in electricity than they earn in Bitcoin. Also, they are not usually invested in the long-term viability of the currency, so they are more likely to short the currency then use their hashpower to attack the network.***
Also wrong. Botnes have no way of surviving, they would get smaller and smaller the longer said security system would be active which I explained earlier. Until succesful long running mining botnets would become a thing of rarity. When the incentive to mine on computers comes back, such news would go around the globe fast, faster than you may think it would - leading to an incredibly high percentage of personal computers being set up with a wallet and a miner. If a person is infected by a botnet, sooner or later that person will find out - even if by getting said news a little late. He or she will find out and will take measures to remove it and mine on his/her own. Dropping hashrate through reinfection would quickly get noticed and leading to removal again. Leading to botnets being dust of history as more time passes, because people learned to take care of their computers, even only if for mining infections. Self and *fast* scaling security effect. Automatically leading to less and less people having infected computers and taking more care of their security and browsing behaviour. Finally having the Bitcoin effect of being your own bank and *having to* learn about how to keep your computer clean on a regular basis. Because then it's not about getting regular infections with malware or ransomware anymore, it's taking care of your god damn money because you may have it on a wallet stored in your computers hdd or a paper wallet, instead of a web wallet if you are a bit smart. Everything would even itself out against such possible attacks automatically fast. Pure logic - sorry but what you have stated would not make sense if you think about it.  
  
And the biggest thing of all needed to be done is already done: A *lot* know about it, and a *lot* don't touch it because it's either a) pricey or b) not possible to mine. Bringing back only 1 incentive of those 2, would have a huge and fast effect. Not advertising of Bitcoin needed. Things would pretty much spread around the world by itself, with mainstream media also picking it up.

Check the answer from "tobixen", you find it in the link above I sent you. Use maybe a different wallet or whatever you want, respend the unconfirmed balance with a higher fee (to yourself, so you can see) and then you can send it out to the service's website wallet again, with a higher fee too. Try Bitcoin Core with this. Or Electrum. Make sure to have the option enabled to have coin control / spend unconfirmed change or whatever it offers regarding these two. For doublespending it (so that the tx with the higher fee finally get`s accepted and the old one dropped) you would need to have your privatekey(s) ready and a safe computer to handle the privatekey. Not all wallet files are fully compatible to other clients.

Yes, they want every single detail.
I told them it's nearly impossible since I have to go trough all pool rewards by hand. Which are hundreds of pages.
But they want it like that. 
 
If we all had a block explorer for -all- crypto currencies with prices from transaction dates in several different currencies, this would be way easier.
 
Many pools are also not existing anymore.
I'm trying the excel files from the guys in this thread in a few days. But I think this still takes ages. It's just too much.
 
 
One day I'm gonna fuck them back in their arses by saying "I'm sorry, I don't have bank accounts and Euro anymore. For my tax payments you'll have to accept Bitcoin." Or when I have to document everything again one day -- just only linking them the wallets on the public block explorers and let them find out by themselves. Which would be quite funny.

The whole mining system is flawed and can be changed. I recently stated a really raw idea concept here in my comments, to be honest ranting about something else too but just overread that if you like: 
  
  
Feel free to discuss. **This could solve a LOT.** Only needs devs to write drafts and get more people into such a discussion. It **is** possible to solve all of the mining centralization, tx spam issue, tx fee issue, mining botnet issue and more with easy security steps. And bring back mining for regular people while sparking a fast news effect. Going back into my small comment thread now, feel free to spread these ideas anywhere you like. If we spread such ideas fast enough, catastrophic outcomes for Bitcoin (also stated in my comment) can be prevented and current things be fixed easily.

an exchange will not process the $5 trade. if you manage to find one processing a $5 trade, you won't get the full amount anyway because of fee on the trade, minimum withdrawal amount plus fee etc.  
i used coinmill for converting btc to usd. it depends on the rate and fees. but get used to the 0.01 minimum buy limit on exchanges. also as said nearly all exchanges have a minimum withdrawal amount of 0.01 BTC. Deduct all possible fees from that and you see the problem. For $5 you would need to buy from some trusted person directly. Maybe you can find someone from localbitcoin who has good reputation and wants to help you with the $5.
Or just deposit a few bucks more somewhere to get around the minimum limit and get your amount minus fees.
OOOr if this is a reoccuring $5 thing, just buy a load more of Coin, hold it (remember volatility risk) and spend when needed.  
  
It's all way easier if you decide to just buy a bit more. But can also bring a bit more risk.

No, as long as there are buyers for ASICs with needed funds (including early Bitcoin investors) and Bitcoin having current mining centralization, there is no incentive for ASIC manufacturers to offer cheaper devices. Moore's law will be applied for a very long time to everything regarding chip production and it's being far away from being cheap or even reaching it's possible endgame. No far sign of the hw potential being squeezed out anytime soon.  
The only cheap equipment will be too slow to gain significant amounts, not even talking breaking even anytime soon before the hardware breaks, or just old.  
As said, centralization will grow, it's a flaw that can easily be fixed. But all invested into mining, especially farms, would do anything against it.

Hey there, me again. You offered me to help me step by step creating safe paper wallets/transfering coins. I'd be glad to have some questions answered.
I now have created paper wallets with canton beckers ubuntu live cd. From a save machine without Ethernet cable and HDD.
 
All paper wallets are BIP38 encrypted, random selfmade keys.
Can I let the paper wallet pdfs now safely print with a printing company, and be 100% safe since the BIP38 keys are written down on paper? I'd like to have them on thick, resistand offset printed high quality paper! (I think the only bad side effect will be that the printing company COULD track &gt;how much&amp;lt; Bitcoin I have. I'll store the public pdfs on my unsafe machines anyway to copy&amp;amp;paste the addresses quickly, so I can send in more bought coins from time to time, which should be okay, right?
Next question:
Encrypting the private keys puts out several more keys which I am new too. I dont have to write them down right? Just archive the encryption html from canton becker (the CD) to be safe I can still encrypt it in 5-7 years?
 
Thank you so much!!
Edit: Another question: How do I make sure the used Bitcoin Ubuntu Wallet CD from Canton Becker doesn't leave any BIP38 keys in my Ram or anything after I shutdown, plugin my Windows HDD and Ethernet Cable in again??

If it's on Google ads: As long as Google get's paid, they might *only* do something against it if someone get's hurt first and files in a report to Google Ads directly. Or lots of reports from different people. Their ad auditing seems like it's shit anyway.  
Removing SEO sites from regular search results takes even longer but is not impossible. Blockchain.info should receive weekly public callouts for not taking care of this - since looking out for things like this and doing their part to prevent it should be *their* job and not those of clueless bitcoin customers getting scammed. Running the website and faking it's url to make it look like it's the real site is - a copyright infringement. Which makes it *clearly* the job of blockchain.info filling out lots of DMCA reports to prevent this.   
  
If I would own BC info, I would have some people searching for new scam duplicate sites 24 7 and filing the DMCA reports. It's a game of cutting off hydra heads, but it still can prevent something for some timeframe. Better only have a scam duplicate website visible for 1-2 days than a week, month or a year. Prevention where it may be possible. Better than doing nothing. Or they could get a lawyer telling google to block domains looking similar - which is difficult since they wanted to go by the name *blockchain*. Highly difficult to blacklist duplicate scamsites automatically without having the effort of DMCA reporting every single one.
  
Or someone finds a user friendly way to verify a website via past blockchain data (signatures of webservers &amp;amp;amp; ceos or something put in a block) and automatically receive warnings in their browser.
 
*forgets Namecoin for a second*  
Can't we just put together some browser which grabs urls / fixed server ips from the blockchain, which have been embedded into that once in the past, to always make sure the user lands on the website he wants? Don't ask me about more technical details, my head is already going crazy, but there *should* be a way. We praise the blockchain for everything - and the mainstream Bitcoin users use alternative blockchain tech for almost nothing. A bit price selling here and everywhere - and lots of reports of scamwebsites. And blocksize discussions. That's what I see. Can't we - you know - change this?

It is possible if you lock out farms. Speaking of the most simple idea: Where's the incentive if you need a new broadband connection to let the miner get into the network when there's a 1-2 mining computers per IP limit. VPNs won't work because of previous stated max connections per ip and also because of latency.  
Speaking of cpu/gpu mining: Only allow a prefixed amount of devices/max hashrate per IP to make one setup with endless gpus or cpus impossible.  
Custom cpu manufacturing: Still no incentive to order production. Known fact and logic that sellers mine before they deliver to increase profits. Lockout rules would prevent this. Also devices made for mining could be identified by their hashrate. Plus if the network starts to require 1-3 hardware fingerprints, said manufactured devices could be more easily identified, blacklisted and locked out. Blacklist stored and verified in the blockchain.   Suddenly there'd be no incentive at all to manufactur such chips/devices.  
  
It **is** possible, but not many want to think like this to flow with the mainstream. All of this would be easily possible and make Bitcoin even more powerful. And it would be even easier to work out than all the future fork workarounds that **we will** face, a lot of them.  
Even an incredibly overall hashrate is easily possible if the incentive for normal computer users would come back. It would go through news everywhere and suddenly there'd still be a strong hashrate *and* happy users. Think of it. Bitcoin's mining and tx problem solved, no more centralized power to those who can afford to run such farms or constantly spam the pool. **Bring some core devs in here and let them go into details about it. It would spark whole new bright ideas on Bitcoin. And prevent a catastrophic future for Bitcoin.**  
Also read my first comment above again please. Bitcoin **will** end like this if there's nothing done as I tried to describe. It's pure logic.    
  
Ps HW fingerprint blacklist solution combined with max devices per IP and also temp tainted spam coins are the easiest solutions. Self evolving algo is just too far away from now, but will come too if Bitcoin survives very long.

According to the link you sent me you sent it out with a fee of 	0.0001 BTC which is 	$ 0.10 and too low for todays bitcoin tx volume it seems, you can still try to doublespend. Here is a link I googled, 
@_date: 2017-02-06 14:48:29
be careful it could reset it's data if you continue trying to start it. you could contact them to find out how to get the private key out. or try to make a full copy of the app and all of it's data to a computer where you can try finding the privkey yourself without risking of damaging the app's data on your phone.  
if the app has strong encryption of it's local data on your phone things get conplicated. does it require a passcode? do a full backup of all the app data, find out where the encrypted private key sits (contact the developers first!!), for security do a double backup, delete the full app and appdata on your phone, reinstall it, set your passcode like you did before, close the app, connect phone again to computer, replace encrypted backup data with those on your phone - could work.
you could also try updating/downgrading your phone's os. there must be something you changed to make the app freeze.  
  
whatever you do: backup multiple times on 2 safe computers. and contact developers, don't get brushed off quick by "rescuing your bitcoin is impossible, bye" - it isn't. and don't hold me accountable for anything you do.  
  
good luck, just my ideas for you. always backup your private keys in a safe offline manner for future bitcoin you buy.

same url appearing in all of these threads lately, yet it still makes people wait a LOT of blocks plus others recommending doublespending (fast as 2 blocks) are being talked down. This is a regular spam brigade doing their thing, solving nothing.  
Just try doublespending it, way quicker and works.  
downvote me i do not care and will continue to recommend doublespending. Why gamble on waiting a fully unknown amount of mined blocks versus doing it withing 2 blocks. but the amateur spam brigade will find an excuse for this again based on political nonsense talk, solving nothing for the user. *8 MB blocks this, 16 MB blocks that, we need to spam this because money here, we need to try harder for big blocks there.* My short response would be: *yawn*  
  
also highly suspicious that a lot of new users who suddenly seem to be midly/highly expertised in bitcoin have problems with transactions are showing up. check past threads. and check which kind of comments are popping up first on what kind of subreddits. i smell yet another cheap try to push for bigger blocks with things like these. and i'm not the only one who calls this out. it's always the same. mempool spamming is also no coincidence. it's clearly a part of pushing for bigger blocks (**HELLO ROGER**), and with this i am too not the only one who noticed this. it's a cheap try.  
  
yet the viabtc method may work with an **unknown waiting time**, which does *not* make it a good and fast solution, but i am still not recommending this, especially for new users - trying to doublespend can solve it faster. And it *is* not that painful as waiting the unknown waiting time and knowing nothing with this viabtc method. doublespending it can only result in one of 2 tx's being dropped and 1 accepted. or both being dropped if you mess up. **miners are bound to drop 1 tx if a second doublespending-tx appears. Even with a different wallet, every else is nonsense.** a case where a tx is hanging in nowhere as unconfirmed can also take days or weeks. doublespending also logically works with using just a different wallet / resetting the wallet after making backups. Electrum *may* be not good for every usecase, but there are several other wallets with which you can do this. all faster than what is quickly being advertised as soon as the thread is being opened. (not calling out *every* thread/comment, but a *huge* percentage is just spam campaign to push for big blocks.) There is basicly no logic that can go right now against doublespending it really fast vs. waiting ???-hours/days. And **no** you are not bound to use viabtc if you used electrum with specific settings, just doublespend it with a different wallet and you are done with it.  
   
Update: Now the user is deleted and thread still active? Whatever. Just keep in mind what I said.

Found another big block pusher. See my edited comment above and try to argue against this. And keep in mind, new users. Double Spending, quick, few clicks, can be done with different wallets - not just electrum or core. And *will* always be faster than the viabtc method. You guys can argue against it all you want. Nice try. But have fun downvoting me anyway like big block spammers always do when they see no other method. DS'ing is faster *and* quick and can be done in minutes and also for new users. Lots of tutorials with different wallets online, period. **We need 1024MB blocks now!!!!!111** &lt;-- My butt. Sorry, but that's it lol. Discuss.

I think you would need to replace some key with one that holds the Thai Baht symbol ฿ and also use some selfmade script or something to let it print out as a ฿, without switching the whole keyboard layout software side. I read that some OS can print this symbol but forgot which one. It's not yet really landed in the *mainstream world*.  
Waiting until all keyboards have the ฿ symbol would be less stressful. Give it a few more years until BC becomes more stable, current problems got solved etc.

they could easily switch the miners with wortless computers and then just keep the miners. and say the other computers are the evidence. because basicly they are "looking the same / are all computers anyway".

Even without these high electricity rates, breaking even takes AGES and is hard, also keep in mind these devices may break for a high percentage of users before ROI comes into effect.  
  
Also you seem to simply ignore the fact that a lot of people keep out of mining because they even need to buy another device for that, which Bitcoin was not intended for in the first place. I am telling you again, ASICs **are** a problem, call it an "exploit" or whatever you want. Or disagree with still sticking to electricity costs. Requiring such devices **does** make it less appealing for regular people only wanting to use their personal computer. Which Bitcoin was intended for, get rewarded for running the wallet, supplying strength to the network and being able to send and receive funds - all of that with just your computer. That's it. Nothing, absolutely nothing can speak against this, no matter how pro-ASIC someone may be.    
  
Producing optimized hardware (remember: required hardware fingerprints + blacklist stored in the chain) is the same as the billion dollar cup of coffee debate . You buy some advertised optimized hardware, it get's blacklisted because it's a danger to mining centralization and becomes useless - the money spent on it is basicly flushed down the toilet. No "optimized hardware" would be produced, because of the missing incentive. Also required hw identification can restrict people just building a rig with endless gpus. You'd need to stick to the restricted amount of hw devices and parts, else the other devices or hw parts such as extra gpus would simply get their work submissions dropped.
About the ETH mining farm: You did not read my post. With said security rules such a farm would be **impossible** in Bitcoin. So read again. You try hard to ignore simple concepts like these security rules of mining (hardware fingerprints, blacklists, limiting amounts of devices etc.) and switch to mass mining again and again. You did not read. Feel free to exit the comment thread then and don't answer if you don't want to read into this. You sadly just did not get it. And I don't need to explain it again. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 21:29:27
You do realize that the whole mining game already is centralized, is being used for manipulation or at least they try to and is a huge problem? There is *no* such way as having influence for the normal user as it was years ago - it *was* fair. Now it's all fucked. No more mining. The network may be secure thus giving Bitcoin a part of it's value, but in detail it's already broken by having too big farms owning too much hashrate. They can someday lead Bitcoin in whatever the direction they want, talking about forks for example, to keep future development more central, lock out a lot or all of current devs and deny/talk down others wanting to contribute. This is the risk that some people thinking *forward* are thinking about. Please be aware of this. Bribing farms etc. The last big risk is people having coins in the hundred thousand area, they can take a big part in such things. Those coins will part of their owners over time (read on for more), no questions asked - but it will take years and lots of dramas in Bitcoin. All those *enemies* do not realize they will destroy the value of their coins in the end anyway. Or at least those of others left - the regular users, buyers, etc.  
I am saying it more clear: ASICs should never even have found their way into this. There needs to be a way to change this and make it more appealing for normal people with a computer, like shuffle algos or let BTC use and develope it's own changing algo to lock out ASICs and find a way to make mass cpu/gpu farming impossible. (**edit** see my 2nd comment below for way more easy solution, the algo thing is just stupid futuristic thinking) Plus taint coins of spammers to use it for spam prevention, like auto dropped spam tx's for x days until they lock themselves out with spam again. Bitcoin going mainstream requires regulation anyway, and more is going towards more clear identification and Bitcoin being anonymous is a long gone history - so why not finally do the step, taint spam coins temporarily and force miners to drop spam tx's until they stop. Besides that take the power from governments and taint stolen or other illegal coins and also drop these tx's until they get auctioned in public + whitelisted. Mixing will be illegal in Europe soon too, high chance of more to follow. Take away their power to turn Bitcoin around by law, update the protocol and just solve it by ourselve. It's not that hard.    
  
ASIC manufacturing has been the biggest mistake ever in Bitcoin history. The network could have held it's strength without them too. Sounds ridiculous but if you think about it, it's real. All because of greed for money and power. Block size is going to get incredibly big over the years and at some day no person can store the blockchain on their computers or even think about syncing a few blocks. Which leads to the chain being centralized on "trusted" company's servers and then it's not Bitcoin anymore. Guess what. People will say "remember the free Bitcoin?" We are facing fucked times.  
  
Added edit: The most idiotic incentive for people holding hundreds of thousands of coins to spam and push for bigger and bigger and then more bigger blocks is: Bloating up Bitcoin's total tx volume with more tx spam after every upcoming block increase to make it look like it has grown "a lot", which is the perfect illusion to push the price and make their big stash worth more. Cash out, be a billionaire or trillionaire, gtfo of Bitcoin, leave it dead with huge problems and that's it. This is going to happen, mark my words. And this is going to be downvoted hard by their accounts. (Which has been called out earlier by others too, sockpuppet accounts all creating new threads about the tx problem, to make a self created problem jump into everyone's eyes a bit more.)  
Please don't be naive thinking blocksize will end with 2MB, 4MB or even 32MB or 64MB. Not even close, some major holders are trying to flip Bitcoin around to make room for more spam, all in their favor. BTC's real tx volume is way smaller than you might see. Think deeply, all major known big names are doing *everything* to push for this, all holding insanely big amounts of coin. Not naming anyone, it's way too obvious.  
  
Disclaimer: Not salty about coin amounts, holding my own and not interested in non natural volume growth coming with big problems. Will exit if more signs of this kind of Bitcoin future will show. At whatever the price will be. More interested in Bitcoin being more open for *anyone* and taking centralized power away. No matter the price. Even if this fake tx spamming would 10000 fold the price in a short time, it will not be a good thing for Bitcoin itself what these people will need to do with Bitcoin to get their agenda finished and reach their price of exit.

Well easiest would be: Inform the top major exchanges and also the top chinese exchanges about to which wallet addresses the coins moved and if some address belongs to them. This way they can identify the real personal account in their customer database, they can force him to pay back or you can file an easy police report. Do not forget to take note of the original transactions you did to the scammer.
I'd try out everything. It's a public ledger for various reasons and tracking stolen money can be one of them.
Oh and if you want to invest in altcoins before they hit the markets, I recommend Binance Launchpad. Trusted investment with Binance selected coins. Just don't make the same mistake twice and think about the fact that investing in an altcoin is a huge risk in general.

I think it would not come in very handy if you transmit your whole brainwallet or private key to someone.  
You would need to send him all the money that is sitting in there, no way of splitting it without any Internet connection.  
Pre-splitting $100 into $0.05 or even $1 or so would require endless wallets that need to be pre made, archived for the day of no Internet and then also be transmitted via radio in a very time consuming manner. Imagine paying your rent that way when you only happen to have your btc split into $10 wallet keys, because you already spent the $100 ones already last month. Horrible.  
  
The tech idea is nice and all. But totally not good for your shopping / bill paying needs that you do daily/ weekly and also in my opinion monthly.  
Also imagine a shop owner having to deal with thousands of recorded private keys every month. Even when handed to him in paper. Horrible.  
  
Then also there is trust. If you tell someone a private key / brainwallet holds $100 but in reality it holds only $10 or even nothing and that person can not verify it because he does not have a full node and no Internet, he needs to blindly trust and eventually get scammed.

Holy cow make sure you decrypt it offline and use a trusted source for downloading the files to encrypt it with. I still use my old canton becker paper wallet CD. Disconnect HDDs+Network, boot from CD, decrypt your BIP38 privkey, write it down on paper and from then on it's your decision what to do with said key. You can import that key nearly everywhere. But I forgot what it was called exactly, WIF no idea. I didn't import keys in quite a while. If I were you I'd try decrypting an **empty dummy wallet** first and import that via try and error until you know which privkey-format is the right one. :)
  
Just make sure that if you expose the key to an online machine, that you *need* to be sure it's as secure as can be (free of malware you didn't know about etc.). Also: Sweep it like you said, don't leave funds and never ever use that wallet again after sweeping.

I think OP means having KYC ID verification on the Exchange. Not PayPal. Asking for buying BTC with an unverified PayPal Account would be either a. totally stupid or b. because someone found out about digital financial tech just now. 
  
u/TLDRonin You can use VirWox.com, they charge a bit of fees, but that't the Price you need to pay for that. See exact fees on their fee-table. Limit is 90-100 bucks per 24hours. No ID verification at all needed. Register, check your email and deposit right away and continue to buy. You will have your BTC in your balance minutes after registering. Your *first* BTC withdrawal will be held for 24-48h, but as said - awesome service, legit guys and these things are fine.  
  
Don't let yourself be scared by naysayers around here trying to scare you off with fees like 20-30%, which is not true. It's a fair and way lower fee, especially if you think about this being the only Exchange where you can get BTC for PayPal.  
Or just pay with Paysafecard and use a 20% fee.  
Your choice. Enjoy!

VirWox.com  - registering w/o verification, but a 90€ limit u can use every 24hours. Also works with paypal.
It supports anonymous PaySafecard you can buy at all gas stations (Germany too). Buying PSCards is anonymous up to a specific amount, depends. Just try it.  
  
But for this anonymous deposit VirWox they charge high fees. 20% or something for deposit. That's the price you pay for being anonymous.  
Or use localobitcoins and drive all the way to the next city which has a seller with a good price, supporting cash instead of wiretransfer and doesn't scam you. Your choice. Goodluck

You only lose if you exchange it for filthy fiat. You could have sold it at the top or you just need to wait.  
Biggest mistake is selling a bottom, wherever it might be - afterwards you buy in higher again anyway.  
  
Just take it easy and don't worry about it. You will be in green again, sooner or later. No doubt.  
Until then you could just relax, take the time and read a bit more into technical things about Bitcoin (security of paper wallets is a good topic).  
  
If you bought for making profit and want to have fiat in the end anyway, then you must admit that you may have bought at the wrong place. Which throws you into waiting or taking the loss anyway.  
  
  
Relax. It's Bitcoin and volatility is getting more intense, this is normal. Especially with big pumps &amp; corrections like this. (See history of Bitcoin prices on bitcoinwisdom.com)  
  
  
Good advice, if you may be interested in holding onto your Bitcoin, is: Store the BTC in a paper wallet. You can easily buy a fraction or a whole BTC again at lower prices. Mark your paper wallets with prices to remember where you bought in. :)

I remember a thread on bitcointalk where someone used his GPU(s) to generate billions of private keys and built a script to check the balance of every single one of them. Seemed quite effective.  
He even found used (but already empty) wallets. At first I thought every truely random generated private key would be secure but this made me think otherwise.  
You can't brute force 1 private key but you can do a lot of random guesses and check if there are some Bitcoin in some of the wallets. So there's that.

There seem to be serious things you need to learn about security in Bitcoin, else you might lose your funds. People lost hundreds of Bitcoin because they thought storing them online or with a Bitcoin Wallet Software, which has been generated on an online machine would be safe.  
  
**1 important rule always applies for Bitcoin** Storing them via a solution, that involves Internet or 3rd party storage, where you don't have absolutely 100% control over, is **not** safe. Blockchain.info, Coinbase, all the same. History repeats. Even googling Bitcoin Wallet solutions leads to scams very quickly. Which is why I offer to teach when I find the time.

WALL OF TEXT WARNING  
  
Handing over Wallet addresses to your gov can produce lots of extra work for some businesses.  
Since these addresses can change multiple times per hour/day, depending on the business.  (Not speaking of exchanges). Not even wanna mention usage of a huge amount of wallets with change addresses, which does happen for reasons.
  
Europe wants to enforce such thing even to private persons. And I already see this as basicly impossible. Broadcasting transactions over a day of use with change addresses can make this almost impossible. Not everyone just holds their coins.  
Even for a public ledger, things get confusing real fast, and it get's worse the more you spend coins. And not everyone is able to write scripts etc. to automate this for their specific gov-case.
  
I tried to document everything for just this scenario which I was feeling it could happen, years ago. I stopped doing that after 1 day, produced huge piles of work just identifying wallets, tracking etc. and making it "gov"-friendly to look through. And that was just regular daily Bitcoin usage. Adding altcoins makes it worse. Also my gov/irs would fuck me in the butt if I simply tell them to "look it up in the blockchain".  
    
For EU it might end up with some up-the-anus-tracked-and-enforced-EU-wallet-usage with built in blockchain analysis, forced Identification for using it, personal IDs stored serverside and insecure of course by your friendly tech savvy country lol, for identifying and live transmitting everything. (Great ID theft attack vector, combined w/ a public ledger - multi combo horror)  
With lots of false reports of wallets you don't own from coins already spent. It only needs a handfull of merchants from a country without such regulations and you got the horror going - missing pieces you can't remember.   Something crazy like that **could** happen. Also: Use a mixer once and you are screwed. Do it twice and... you can guess it.  
  
All of this could be future horror scenarios. I bet my butt that e.g. EU would never think about developing an own sidechain/whatever for something crazy like that, **if** it might happen. They'd be like "solve it yourself, hand all details within x days or enjoy multi-buttfuckery kthanxbayy"  And I'm damn sure they expect users to hand over max amounts of e.g. 5-10 addresses, via oldschool methods. Everyone above these limits is - you guess it - fucked. They'd make sure to not get piles of lists with hundreds/thousands of wallets per user/business. Also I bet (again, lol) that EU would use a regular bc.info API to pull the data of everything constantly and fail miserably, before realising there are better ways to solve their internal tasks lol. This might take much much longer than they announced ("2017/end of 2017"). IRS agencies around here have already proven total incompetence in this field. Years ago - and nothing changed. Still the same.
  
Btw: I'm done.  
  
**TLDR: Nothing stops them but complete failure. EU might just fuck it up completely. The basic idea of requesting wallet addresses for identification and tracking is total BS imo. At least w/ this kind of incompetence. (I mean come on, main reason to prevent terrorism? Again this BS excuse which is already used for everything else?)  
No idea about the US.**

With an old swept wallet, you can do whatever you want with it. But don't use it again for loading BTC into it.  
You could put them in an archive somewhere. I archived 90% of my paper wallets I swept and it's a huge stack now haha. Also funny for looking through it after years for seeing how much money you spent for stupid things :D 
  
I do this for if day-x comes and the tax authorities want to see proof of this and that. Then you can say, here Sir, see my old wallet.  
Provides proof you had control over said Bitcoin within that timeframe.  
Because you never know for what you might need them.  
  
Also funny sideeffect: Some altcoin had given old swept BTC wallets a specific amount of BTC for free (in Clamcoins I think), which I converted to Bitcoin too. :) Free money!
@_date: 2017-01-27 06:32:43
I feel like we need to find a way to automatically sort out spam txs out of statistics, which also happen when the mempool is not incredibly high. Those txs where someone just sends BTC back and forth to himself. To get more accurate statistics. Would feel way better.  
  
But anyway it is a cool number!

That.. was quick. As said in the thread about NL going after mixers: The game is on devs, go and save our privacy!  
There is no logic at all considering financial privacy to be illegal. They'd be better off using their "terrorism" excuse to go after terrorists and also people who steal coins, fund development of preventing what is illegal - and just leave private persons alone and happy with their fin.-privacy.  
How do they want to go after **local used mixers, like something implemented in a wallet? Forbid software?**  
  
Instead of banning Bitcoin Mixing - make things better. It's the same with drug markets: You cut off the head of a hydra and new ones grow almost instantly, just in a different variant and with a different name maybe. Going after Mixers does not solve *anything*. We need some god damn kind of Bitcoin Consulat thing who govs should talk to before going full retard all over - again. There always are way way better solutions, without seeing the hydra-effect happening again on it, which may result in govs being angry at Bitcoin itself.
Those guys are in serious need to hire conceptional experts and devs who are in cryptocurrency. And not hiring experts of tracing cryptocurrencies and spawning one hydra-head after another.

I think mixer services already saw this happening somewhen. It's logical. Which is why I hope they are secretly working on things to bypass recognition. For great Bitcoin freedom!

@_date: 2016-12-30 13:20:08
Most simple an best answer you'll find in this thread (i hope):  
Install Electrum. And do as it says on startup, very easy.  
Does NOT download the Blockchain, takes just a few MB on your HDD, is fast as hell and you can send Bitcoin almost instant. I switched from BTCCore to it and it's awesome. do it!  
  
It doesn't rely on any 3rd party. It uses servers you connect to automatically which are there to store the blockchain on for you, so you do not have to.  
  
For generating save cold storage offline wallets: First: Forget Armory. Don't use it. No matter what people say. This was a good solution, and it's broken, people losing coins left and right. The project is abandoned.
Best is: Have a save computer which has not and will not see the light of the Internet to generate paper wallets (protect them with a BIP38 key!!!). You should check canton becker's bitcoinpaperwallet.com &lt;-- Has great advices on how to do it securely too, if you take the time to read. Plus it's free. (Also offers a LiveCD with the PaperWallet generator if you want to pay)  
  
**IMPORTANT SIDENOTES:** If your machine is infected with something or you expose a PrivateKey, which is the key to spend all your coins from anywhere, to any online device, then your coins can be considered gone. Also a network printer can be the entry for malware to steal it from since they save scans etc) Your PrivateKey is the most important thing (or your "seed" for restoring your Electrum wallet), it only is as secure as serious you take security.
  
Also do NEVER install random wallet software from Appstores which do not have enough reputation. Android/Apple appstores have a ton of wallets that look legit but are just there to steal your coins. Stay safe. (If you don't believe me, search on reddit for "appstore" and "fake wallet". You'll see. Also be careful which external sites you visit - ESPECIALLY on Bitcoin related subreddits, else you will get infected with ransomware quick. I got infected just recently. This shit is pricey as hell.)  
  
Over and out.

For 2.: Thanks a lot! Never knew that! I always had to use those sketchy generators and pray it worked. But for generating keys itself. Your tip comes in handy for converting to qr anyways!  
In fact I have been using a wallet generator script which seems to be generating backdoored keys or so and I happened to never get my balance wiped away, always got lucky! Don't want to post it here since I got no real evidence (no coding skills to review it) and therefore I can not poop on this guy's code but there have been several people reporting stolen funds from a specific generator.

Just take care if you chose electrum and get a phishing popup urging you to install a malware electrum version.  
I‘d chose Bitcoin Core, there are also many (!) commands you can learn about to get full control over how your wallet behaves. Also make wallet.dat file backups very often!  
  
If you want a more easy and the safest way to use Bitcoin, buy a Trezor. (  
It‘s the first ever released hardware wallet and the most safe one if used correctly. (It‘s easy, you can‘t do much wrong with it!)

I saw a wallet with bc1 adresses too once!  
Can I send BTC there from an 3 adress and also receive from a 3 adress?  
I don't understand all this bc1 stuff.  
  
If I send my BTC from an adress which is not supported by the bc1 adress but the wallet somehow still sends it through, will the BTC be lost forever? (In a case where I don't have access to the private key)
@_date: 2019-06-19 10:39:43
Please google ponzi scams. It may be one where you can only get paid if others invest too and the admin runs with the money if enough people invest.  
  
Also setting up an investment site which guarantees profits can be set up for just a few bucks and the admin can shutdown the website when the first person invests. Even when he shuts down the website, since hosting, a pre made design and a url are cheap and can be acquired anonymously, he can still be in „profit“ with the stolen funds.
  
Remember: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  
  
If there would be a guaranteed(!) way of making more Bitcoin, without getting scammed, everyone would do it. But there is none.  
Take care and don‘t fall for any of this.

Checking the start of an adress is actually a bad idea in my opionion since such an adress could be vanity mined in a second and then swapped. You are more safe checking the END of the adress you are sending your coins too! :)
At least that is what I always do since I discovered vanity mining and saw how fast you could just "clone" an adress which looks the same as the original one based on the first characters.
Vanity mining until the end of an adress is impossible.

It has happened before with regular mobile and desktop wallets where users suddenly had funds of other because of some bad random number generator.
I remember this one guy suddenly having over 100 Bitcoin from only using the Exodus wallet lol (this is no "advertisement" for that wallet, decide for yourself which wallet you want to use).
Also there is this guy from bitcointalk who was constantly generating billions of private key / adresses with his GPUs and a custom script. He somehow managed to end up with quite a few keys that already have been used before.  
So it is possible. But highly unlikely that you have the keypair of someone else. Plus that key is currently funded - very unlikely.

Even the thing with using stop losses for preventing a liquidation seems crazy nowadays since there is this so called stop-loss-hunting thing going on where magically all of the people's stop losses get triggered.  
I happened to have a midly sized position on BitMEX just recently and was ONE dollar away from getting liquidated. Got crazy lucky away with that one. Since then I think I am no longer trading there anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:26:09
Also this is a nightmare i feared years ago and always checked the BIP key that it decrypts everything just fine before sending anything there. I used canton becker's ubuntu paper wallet cd for years and never had any problem. Besides forgetting to change the keyboard layout from qwerty to qwertz. Maybe this could help OP?
Also you could try to remember if you happen to slip to a different key on your keyboard pretty often in the past and try that out with your BIP key. Could also be that you have put a space before or after your password.  
Oh and also maybe try to just get your hands on the canton becker paper wallet generator zip file, run it offline in a safe way and try to decrypt it with that! Maybe it works "better".
 
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:07:17
Hm seems like I just had the luck of using the fitting browser, os and generator for years then instead of bad luck with the wrong combination.  
All BIP38 keys worked for me all the time, switched to Trezor because it's easier for me.  
  
But yeah recommending Trezor to everyone else too. Or as said validating your BIP38 keys, also with a second totally different setup if needed.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:06:31
While this seems incredibly stupid to most here, it may be just an example photo to demonstrate how the paper wallet will look and the private key is not going to be sold and be landing in the sellers trash.  
  
I don't think anyone could be that stupid. If you look at the sellers reputation, it doesn't look like he would want to risk his account. If it would be an account with next to zero reputation, label it as a scam.  
  
But still, the only risky thing here is: You trust someone else that he a) does not secretly store the keys and b) that they have been created in the most safe way.

Little story about how it went for me and how I feel about fractions now. All in all I owned many full BTC, stopped counting. A lot.  
Now it feels wrong buying small fractions. Especially because I sold at the wrong point right before the mega bullrun. Was able to afford several full BTC months ago. Had to wait for rebuy point which never happened and praised to god that the following months would not be the final several thousand dollar pump, because I never had that much of a bad timing. It turned out it was as we all can see on the charts now.. And I was 100% sure about the several thousand $ pump, am even still sure about way more. Did also tell others. But the main problem remains that I was stupid enough to start trading again after years to make more BTC in the end. Lost my first BTC because of it years ago, never wanted to do it again, but did. F
 
Sitting with less than 0.1 BTC now instead of several full BTC. Told myself fuck it and went to buy some things with the money because I went all in every month and noticed it won't go back to my needed buypoint anyway. (Seeing ~$1500 as possible buypoint now for a very short time period soon but that enlightment came too late.) I'm out for good with buying more BTC and still pissed af also because it took so long getting the money together. Looking at all my tx history is getting me mad. Now I'm trying to acquire full BTC every day without putting money on it. Legal of course, but there won't be any way, no success yet.
 
Until I pulled off my masterfail I was the happiest dude buying big fractions and also full BTC every month because I knew this several thousand dollar pump would happen. But the timing of all events was more than bad.
Wishing others more luck than me!
And I still tell it like I think it is: The price will be at much much higher levels in the future for a short time, and most will not get to even sell there. Exchanges will get "hacked", coins will be lost/stolen, exchanges are getting ddosed and what not. Not even talking about who the hell will magically make unimaginable amounts of Fiat appear in your bank acc for your sell order, things *will* get rough. Take care and make your plans about how to cash out before the real big things happen.  
  
Btw: Sorry for the slightly OT post, needed to talk it out once here on reddit. Good luck all!

You can buy BTC on VirWox.com with PayPal.  
You could send a mail tothem and ask them if you also can transfer your currency to PayPal from there. (You need to buy/sell lindendollars for btc there.)

Please for the love of god watch what you download. If you infect your machine with coin stealing malware, which not all scanners detect, you can easily get them stolen if you figure out the password one day.  
I would not download any password cracker. Only if it is open source and you can read the code and know what you are doing.

Just look at their own coin LIZA. Worth 2 Satoshi back then, then pumped to 0.10+BTC after a they basically stole a lot of them from user balances so no one can profit before the pump ("for better trade" according to their twitter). Then dump and pump to several 1000+BTC(!!!) worth per 1 LIZA. And guess what, they stole most of the Coins before it happened from users again. Now comes the cherry on top: You could not withdraw because they did not release a wallet, no block explorer, nothing.  
  
Glad I did not invest in it. I call this a scam.

Congratulations!  
Technically I now own 0.5 BTC too!
Because 1.0 BTC is belonging to my daughter which I bought her. Just managed to sell the top some time ago, and rebuy cheaper so there's now a bit of it more in the balance.  
Was only 2 trades though. But I got huge respect for you successfully trading over such a long term and such big gains! Also with just such little money.  
Good job!
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:53:58
Woah that is a ballsy bet. I NEVER would have the balls to do this game mode with such a high amount of BTC.
You did it. And you lost. Sorry for your loss. But hey that is how gambling works. High risk can come with a high reward or high loss.
I stopped gambling a long time ago because I kept losing 1m satoshis at a time and at one point I could not recover it. It was never as much as a full BTC but still.

I recommend the Trezor. As far as I know it was the first hardware wallet for Bitcoin.  
Never lost coins with that but it depends on how much care you take for remembering your PIN, securing your seed, not falling for malware which switches out your adresses when sending coins (always double check adresses)  
  
Never tried out the Ledger but I think you need to watch out for the same security steps.
@_date: 2019-01-09 21:04:09

@_date: 2018-11-19 00:57:28
Yes. Lost a lot. But not falling for anything anymore.
Reminds me of this one time I won, where a scammer wanted me to send him BTC so I get more BTC back. I did and got more BTC back. Expected me to invest again with more but I didn't. Took the money and ran. That was stupid as fuck lol Was about 3x 0.01 BTC or something back when BTC was at around $300 or $400.
Warning: This was YEARS ago! This does not mean scammers send you more BTC back or even anything back nowadays! Take care and stay away from them! I just happend to be young and stupid not knowing what that was. Also I think a lot of people got burned days later when he ran away with the money.
Never ever participate in such a thing. Never. It does not work out. 99% of the people lose their money.

Honestly no idea, I only know of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. Install the wallets somewhere safe (especially with other suspicious forks) and claim the coins. IRC (server: freenode) has some altcoins channels where more experienced people are who know about all forks!
Try out  or hop on  and ask for the correct channel there.
@_date: 2019-09-08 23:51:13
Is this made with bitcoinpaperwallet.com?
Take extra care because people reported getting their wallets emptied. I suspect the random number generating process to be malicious but that‘s just my opinion.  
  
Take care with that and maybe do a search to see the victim reports yourself.

Please remember that private key exposure to an unsafe computer or even to an untrusted wallet can lead to instant loss of all Bitcoin. Also never tell anyone your private key or send them a wallet file!  
So also google how to correctly sweep a cold storage wallet.
Plus google about change adresses. If you only spend a part of a paper wallet's balance, chances are there that the leftover Bitcoin 'change' is going to an adress you have no control over, depending on how things are being done.
Also the IRC chat channel  (on a freenode server) is a good place to consult! (Google freenode web chat.)  
Many helpful and trusted people are around there like Channel Operators (OPs, with the @ before their name)

I would charge the macbook battery to 100%, not click or start anything, book a flight and hand that thing to this guy's recovery service in person. (Was it Dave? David? Just google David's/Dave's Bitcoin Recovery Service. He's legit and does a good job recovering wallets since some time.)
Make sure to have the power cord with you and keep all things like WiFi, Bluetooth etc turned off.
At this point I do not know if it would be smarter to travel with it having the macbook lid closed or open.
 
May be either a stupid or a genius advice. I can't code or search my RAM for things, but above mentioned method would give me the most peace of mind, knowing someone professionally tries to recover it.
 
Hoping the best for you. Please update and tell what decision you made. I somehow feel really connected to this.
  
**EDIT**: His reddit profile is His website: 
 
Maybe shoot him a Private Message/Email or ask for his phone number so you can talk about this with him. I'm very sure he can help.  
  
For all other users here's how I do it: When I decide to use a new adress for sending coins to, I *always* write down the private key on a piece of paper first in case anything weird may happen. Saved my butt more times than I'd like to admit. (Remember: Take the 20 seconds to write it down, do **not** be lazy and just take a picture from your display with your phone or similar!)

I was just using bc.info last night and was just thinking about that. Just because bc.info has a history of, let's call it *not being the safest wallet service around*.
 
Already feels bad just using their block explorer. Using blockr.io in general, works great - only talking about block explorer. Not using any online wallet service. (Only problem is that bc.info shows blocks a little bit faster than blockr.io sometimes)

Wasn't this a rumor every year again?  
I mean it's great news, as always. But those news repeating over years are making me think this is not going to happen. Sure eBay may need lots of time to test and apply Bitcoin acceptance for their large scale business, but I have seen big businesses implement Bitcoin acceptance way quicker.  
  
I think it's not going to happen this year. If it will: Holy god, nice! But those repeating news are giving me headaches. Look at VALVe, they managed to do it rather quickly compared to eBay. VALVe did remove it though in Steam but yeah.  
  
Still keeping my fingers crossed!

I don't know exactly how to math tonight, but I think if we run into problems with the current amount of decimals we have, there should be a way to just add a few more. Like Micro-Satoshi or and so on.  
  
But then again, I am not able to think deep enough tonight about this being the same than just being a *"government"* and "*printing*" new Bitcoin, and hope the overall price of Bitcoin will skyrocket even more. Or something.
 
I mean there's also this other thing: Let's say about 10 Million Bitcoin will get burned within the next 10-20 years. Just some wild guessed number, for the fun of it. This really boggles my mind. Lost private keys can not be recovered. And unknown keys can not be guessed. So coins that go *poof* would make the problem of serving everyone on the planet with Bitcoin as a currency even more problematic, right? If a real big fuckton of Bitcoin would get burned, the only way to *"fix"* this would be hoping for a *real insane* price (like *100 Satoshi = $1*), if *1 Satoshi* will be kept *as the smallest unit*. Or am I totally thinking wrong here?!

@_date: 2017-07-09 12:21:49
For the fee: Yes, this is very bad.  
On regular exchanges (you need to get verified first) you pay way way less than that. &lt;1%.  
Don't forget to withdraw your coins as soon as you bought them to a wallet you control. I recommend buying a trezor hardware wallet. Safest, reputable and trusted. btw trezor.io, pls don't fall for scam sites. (May want to wait when it's available again and use a safely created paper wallet until then if you like.)
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:57:02

This. Do NEVER use a web wallet.  
Just search for „blockchain.info“ and „hacked“, thousands of people lost their money.  
With a Trezor you can safely store your Bitcoin even when it‘s connected to an infected computer. You just need to be careful of copy and paste Bitcoin malware. Just confirm the address on your Trezor display.  
And NEVER store your Trezor seed, pin and password digitally. Never.

For people who want to buy Bitcoin and hold for long term, there's only 1 advice left: Don't move your coins. Keep them where they are, until time has passed and everything has settled.  
Edit: Do not keep them in any(!) exchange or online wallet. Even if you have your own offline wallet, don't move them.

Paper wallets are not safe anymore.
Don't believe anyone telling you otherwise.Read this thread and you will notice that you are playing with fire using a paper wallet:
I recommend a Trezor, since it's the first hardware wallet that has ever been released and has the best reputation. Ledger has bluetooth, which kinda makes it vulnerable.  
No matter how safe you think you are while generating a paper wallet offline, the generation progress itself may be backdoored and you can not know. It would never trust anything, not even bitaddress, which generates my keys via e.g. JavaScript (a website).

The MOST safe is: Buy a Trezor, never store the seed/passphrase/pin digitally, always double check addresses on your screen if it matches where you want to send them to and that‘s it! I personally never had issues with it.  
A Trezor even stores BTC safe when plugged into an infected machine (that is how it was advertised as far as I can remember).  
  
Have fun with it, you will enjoy that little thing! :)  
The BTC can only be sent out of your Trezor Hardware wallet if you confirm the sending process with the push of a physical button! Nice tiny device if you ask me!  
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:28:59
Using Electrum for beginners is a bit of a bad advice since many beginners fall for Electrum pop up notices with malware updates. Also a beginner can easily visit a website, get his machine infected through that site, enter his electrum password in the client and boom the coins are gone.  
Just google how many people lost their coins with software wallets in general.  
In my opinion desktop software wallets are not for beginners, no matter if it‘s Electrum or Bitcoin Core or something else. Too much bad stuff happened with beginners and desktop software or even web wallets.
