"Korea is not the only country wanting to become cashless.
“A number of developed countries are turning to non-cash policies to enhance the effectiveness of their economic systems,” said Lee Hyo-chan, the head of the research center at the Credit Finance Institute. Sweden, which is one of the pioneers in this move, has a cash payment ratio around 20 percent, much lower than the global average of 75 percent. It restricts using cash for public transportation, and many banks do not handle cash. Some countries, mostly in Europe, ban using cash for large transactions, according to the institute." this is interesting.

I don't think so, they have benefit with all of this, probably worst mistake ever done was previous announcement  so they won't make it again.
@_date: 2016-03-13 12:20:26
I don't get it, can you explain a little bit more.
