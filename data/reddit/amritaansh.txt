Try blockfolio, not sure if it tracks the specific de exchange you mentioned

Can you help me predict the short term price movement by looking at this snapshot of the order book?
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:06:47
I still don’t get how people interpret buy and sell walls.. can you please post a screenshot and explain what you’re talking about and how you interpret it to predict the price movement in the short term?
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:39:15
How do you exactly tell that? Is it by looking at the buy/sell walls? Please ELI5
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:17:12
I see, so when the btc price reaches 15200 it’ll be stuck there until this wall collapses.

Watch this as the guy is way more eloquent than me and gives a very good overview of why this tech is not a buzzword and what it’s doing

Exactly

I give up, judging by your responses it looks like you have already made up your mind that crypto is a scam and nothing can convince you otherwise. So i won't bother answering here anymore

It’s working for me?! 
Try appending https:// to the beginning

Can someone explain to me exactly what a wall is in this context? And how do you visualize it?
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:57:00
Does this to me all the time. Strangely just force closing the app process(swipe up from multitasking) fixes it and I’m already logged in when I restart the app.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:07:20
I guess you should then not invest any in crypto and call it a day
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:29:12
Don’t

A private key is 256 bits long. Randomly guessing the correct key out of the full sample space of keys by brute forcing and trying each possible key is an unfathomably large amount of work. 
Watch this great video to get a better idea of exactly how large is 256 bit key space

Won’t matter. The moment it’s public knowledge that bitcoin isn’t secure it loses trust and hence all value.
Also would you reveal it to the pubic if you cracked rsa and sha? Someone has maybe figured it out and is secretly getting rich off it.

Any KeepKeys out there?
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:48:57
RSA or SHA 265 being cracked or a serious vulnerability being discovered in them.

Using a hardware (or even a software) wallet which generated pub/priv keys at random makes bitcoin virtually anonymous, just transfer out of an exchange to a software wallet, bounce it around a couple of times and then send to your hardware wallet.

I think one of the best properties of bitcoin is the tamper proof block chain technology that really has value. 
It’s really the first time a decentralized ‘currency’ has become majorly mainstream.
 
It’s like evaluating how valuable a patent is.. almost like paying a premium to use this technology.

You can always double spend your transaction with a higher fees and that would be picked up by the miners and your older transaction will be dropped as being already spent.

Can’t use it for anything is not correct though right? Bitcoin has ushered in a slew of useful applications based on block chain.
I agree while bitcoin is not really useful as a currency atm because of the volatility and public’s perception is it as an investment but it can be if it stabilizes and that’s the original vision in Satoshis paper.
I think of justifying buying bitcoin as akin to buying stock in a tech company whose product you believe is revolutionary.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:31:55
That makes sense. What I don’t understand is why would someone even buy bitcoins at higher prices like say there is an offer for 1000 bitcoins at 17k and another offer for 1000 bitcoins at 18k.. why do exchanges even allow this?
