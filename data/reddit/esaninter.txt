mental picture : 1 *Every cash note in circulation is being chased after by someone who pledged a note of debt to create it ... even if you hold the note debt free ... some fool is out there desperately trying to obtain it in order to service or clear their own debt.* 
metal picture : 2  *Ever seen the infograph of the world debt as stacks of $100s towering over the World Trade Towers?*

just print the damn thing in HTML ... The Bitcoin Daily Standard ... one broad sheet ... once a day ... yes I will read it ... but not as a PDF

option A
why not this?  we offer our own PAC-like donation fund ... "Hey wiki you can have 1000 BTC if you accept them" 
I'll pledge 0.5 BTC ($5) if-then way
option B
some BTC escrow service acts as the middleman ... their charitable act will provide them with good press.

best guess :: 30,000 BTC tied to bonds (4 week maturity) via GBLSE securities, plus 10,000 BTC in private contracts (OTC private arrangements) ... $220K worth of burned bitcoin believers if they fail ... again just a guesstimate

So is this a subtle suggestion to place a wager against BTCST (hedge) ... oddly "Bets of Bitcoin" could provide means of insurance against defaults in the bitcoin economy ... but then we get stuck in the endless loop of who insures the insurer ;)

Yes the math/logic seems to be a little off the mark. Yet the Spirit is key.  *Prevent Hording &amp;&amp; Incourage Spending* ... You would need a system where you have only ONE account ... like a SSN / hell that could be it ... and you would have to tax on the 365 day account balance average ... the cool part (besides screwing 1%'rs) ... is that the TAX would feed back into the system ... support the MINERS/NETWORK ... on a sour note ... the Rich would never play this game but the plebes could and thus move thier commoner money out of the Street/City fractional derivative inflationary bank credit scam.

question  ... say spot is $3.20 ... with standing order to SELL 100btc @ $3.22 ... the current lowest ASK
Now for some foolish reason you submit an order to BUY 50btc @ $30 ...
What happens? 
... my guess is you end up instantly to the top of orders to fill and are matched with the ASK of SELL 100btc @ $3.22 ... so you take 50btc @ $3.22
