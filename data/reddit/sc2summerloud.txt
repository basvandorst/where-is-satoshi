Are you retarded?

thats just bullshit and rigged official statistics
even adjusted by official inflation number, real wages have been declining for decades. and in the 70s you could actually support a familiy off a single income.

how will btc "taking off" magically re-distribute coins?
the rich will get richer, as usual. this pattern is worse in btc than it is in fiat...

300 billion sitting on the sidelines?
thats 30x as much money as is estimated to have ever entered the crypto space....
or are you one of the ppl who dont understand the concept of market cap?
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:37:46
this times a thousand
btc fanboys need to realize that  what happens in the crypto space right now is 1000x more evil / manipulated than the oh-so despised fiat ponzi of the real world

500 - 2000$
i think the downward trend will continue to gain momentum, then get slower and slower after breaking south of 5k, when the percentage of diehard-hodlers gets bigger, and some gold diggers try to get into the market again

if the energy used in btc mining is from renewables, then someone else is going to use more coal
it raises energy demand, thus it raises the amount of fossil fules spent. its that easy.

Why is it sound money? Because of the myth about fixed supply? Even if supply was fixed, did you guys ever stop to think if maybe inlation fiat money isnt such a bad thing after all? Its not like everyone is off so much worse since bretton woods...

to rephrase that:
goos news everyone - all the people are fleeing the market, so soon there should be no one left to sell except for hardcore hodlers!

id say the mean jack all until they are spent

this is what any sensible person would have done.
what OP did is like a company ordering their keycards separately and having the card supplier print the pictures/names on each card separately
it would take a few hours at most to come up with a software solution (even MS word could do it) for serial printing different keys on different cards, and you just buy 1000 cards with the bitcoin logo

coinmarketcap is not a good source, as its often way behind with tether market cap. it took weeks to include the last 600mn for example
@_date: 2018-07-09 17:25:04
so, what you are saying is, we wont get to see mcafee eat his dick?
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:07:46
shifting it doesnt help, since there is no system to cmc lagging behind real tether market cap.
also, like others stated, it doesnt matter, since newly printed tethers might get printed in batches of 100mn, but they are not spent all at once, so any correlation seeking would have to be much more detailed... but even then id say its impossible to measure the effect it had on the market really... in my opinion, most people severel underestimate the effect it had...

how exactly will you profit from people who do not buy bitcoin? please elaborate
