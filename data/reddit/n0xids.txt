Can confirm visa buy works, 2.9%.
Edit: And visa debit to bank does not, had to try!
@_date: 2014-09-30 04:19:04
Pretty much.  Not a first time buying but even where I am in up in Canada for me this just became the best option.  Online places want id's and bill statements etc. ATM's are charging 7-10% as well as the retail exhanges.  Straight up 3% from my credit card I can pay off instantly? Fuck yeah.
@_date: 2014-10-06 05:17:09
Annnddd it was instant. Kind of makes me happy like they're like "woah bro, shits crashing hold on a second I'll get you a better price".  Maybe just because it worked out in my favour.
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:35:37
Also visa debit cards don't work with interac, so banks like TD are out from buying there.

Sold user funds to pay the coinlab $75 million fine? Tried to recover since but had to halt withdrawals as they didn't recover enough in fee's and such in time. Possible?

I love my country haha
@_date: 2014-09-28 22:50:25
Setting it up, and I like to look at the stats and stuff on it.  Nothing else i'd do with the card and monitor anyways.
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:45:31
Practically nothing.  My old GPU mining rigs with 5 high end cards would cost $2-3 a day in electricity pulling 1500 watts from the wall.  This is using MAX 150 watts - under $10 a month in electricity.
Bandwidth is a separate thing but I have tons of extra so it's not an issue here.

Just went to go cancel .25 that's been pending since thursday, was just updated to canceled from them.  Win?
Now to try again at this price!

@_date: 2014-09-28 22:59:10
Yeah it definitely does but it works well as an insulator.  Used it before when running a bunch of milk crate gpu miner rigs and never had any sort of issues.  People letting dust clog up computers is a much more serious issue in regards to any chance of fire or heat.
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:46:29
You can still do that with a PC..
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:37:33
I'm not, just old stuff laying around put to good use.

Yep can't be any simpler.  Scan, enter password. Do what you gotta do.
@_date: 2014-09-29 01:05:46
Meant interac online.  Hell just checked on TD's website just to confirm-


@_date: 2014-09-30 01:05:57
Might have to try this!
@_date: 2014-11-21 05:26:49
Almost like that 3m glass case with a million or however much mounted on the sidewalk in some city.  Great advertising, let's anyone feel like they could try if they really wanted.

Then the opposite occurs and people see the value at $0.0000XXX and think it's worth nothing.  And instead of dividing your multiplying.  Too extreme of a change.  Which brings us to mbits starting to be used more often already.

im drunk and have upvotges
@_date: 2015-01-04 06:35:25
No issues yet for me, figure with CC deposit I can at least charge back if they try any shit.  No issue with weekly buys for months luckily.  Just sadly not to many options that work smoothly for Canadians yet.
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:26:15
If it adds to this at all, bitcoin core nodes won't run if the time is out.  Have had my system time reset (cmos battery must be dead..) and sitting in 2003 or so and it forces a validation of the block chain.  So I'm going to guess everything is forced to be within a certain timestamp range or be considered invalid.

Detached garage haha, but there's minimal heat and it's quite cold in there.

Gonna take a guess that the fee is what is $10 minimum and caps at $50.

Wrong.  Colour the whole thing blue.

If you think there's any chance in 10 years it could worth much more, would you look back and think you missed a train with what's going on today?  Just don't spend more than you could live with if it burned to nothing.
@_date: 2016-06-13 07:39:48
Not quite hodling but trading to acquire as much btc as possible without cashing out.  Probably sell when a few could buy a house, and save one for sure for kids to pass on.  So could go into the decades before I spend any.
@_date: 2016-06-12 23:48:06
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:17:58
fee's by that point if it's still around will be the main reward
@_date: 2016-06-12 15:10:54
At this rate just check back in a day or two.
@_date: 2016-06-12 18:42:21
Well that was the issue with mtgox, being the major exchange at the time.  At least nowadays we have a large variety of major exchanges, a lot more has to happen to move the entire market.

Nodes can choose whether to be full nodes or running a pruned blockchain.  Believe they started implementing it in the last core update.
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:43:05
Any more pictures/specs?  Interested in that frame/case, I like how contained it is.
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:29:22
Pruning should help out the raspberry nodes, looking forward to trying it out.
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:07:19
You're already 50/50 on the savings, might as well leave it that way until you get out.  It's more likely that cash will still be around in a few years, btc is still a gamble.
@_date: 2015-11-03 13:56:51
Not alone
@_date: 2015-10-18 09:47:01
Turned it off for some reason, maybe needed the Ethernet cord.  Add another to the count as I go push that power button.

Used them in the past to buy bitcoin via debit, worked flawlessly.
@_date: 2015-02-05 04:24:50
Easy for someone who is around computers often.  See if your regular middle aged mom is going to do all that, not likely.  When there is a large portion of the general populous that doesn't even grasp that you can have part of a bitcoin, yeah no.
@_date: 2015-02-07 19:57:15
Trying it out, sent $50 to my TD visa debit card last night.  3-5 days, shall update when it deposits.

I have a raspberry pi 2 syncing up right now on 0.10 so far without a hitch, that's pretty minimal.  But like you I also have an old gaming rig (core 2 duo) and it's done the job as a node for 6 months now without issue.
