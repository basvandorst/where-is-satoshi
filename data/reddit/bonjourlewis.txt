It’s hard to imagine a currency where the controllers can just print more whenever they like

 Bitbargain.co.uk in fact I buy LTC

I love this. Just point out to her this is why she is broke

Banks are making millions from exactly this on traditional exchanges. 
Look up arbitrage
Then look up high frequency trading
Mind will be blown

Do not sell

Sending SEPA transfers to revolut doesn’t work? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:48:33
Switch to a different bank mate

1.5% fee? So it’ll be cheaper to send money to GDAX, trade it, then send it back to revolut ? 
Or am I missing something 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:16:40
Because the exchanges have to tell them 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:24:10
Send it to your wallet via GDAX, they pay the fee 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:57:05
Only 9% in two days. I’ll take that

Get revolut app. Make a euro account. Send from coinbase to euro account. Exchange to GBP within revolut app for zero fees 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:13:59
Get revolut app and create a EUR bank account
Coinbase -&gt; GDAX -&gt; trade it to EUR -&gt; withdraw using SEPA to revolut -&gt; exchange to £ in revolut app -&gt; withdraw to UK bank 
The SEPA fee is 0.15 Euro and the exchange within revolut has no fee 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:45:02
You haven’t lost if you haven’t sold 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:24:47
It can take a few business days for a SEPA transfer 
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:46:56
Lol no. It’s called anonymity 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:37:08
Dude get revolut app. They give you a EUR account. So load revolut with £, exchange it in the app for € with no fees then SEPA to coinbase for no fees.

Not really. Trying to guess a seed is trying to guess any seed. The powerball has one specific winner but there will be many seeds

Fiat currencies are a Ponzi scheme that will collapse sooner or later. Research how the federal reserve can just create dollars out of nothing. 
After fiat collapses we are going to need a currency that banks and governments can’t just print more of. Bitcoin or crypto currency will be that

Bitbargain.co.uk 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:20:56
This is the best way with close to zero fees
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:07:14
Yep done a few times

LBC is leading Britain’s conversation

They aren't stopping mining. They are stopping cloud mining.  The physical miners are still running they are just taking the hit themselves rather than those of us who own GHS

Sounds decentralised to me
