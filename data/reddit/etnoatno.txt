No, I'm saying making BTC illegal won't make it go away.
Just like making drugs illegal didn't end drug consumption.
Buying drugs is not the only use case for bitcoin, it's not 2013.

Just hodl and you'll be safe, if crypto becomes more and more popular they will eventually have to lift the ban.
If you want to exchange to fiat, to be safe you can travel to a neighbour country and use localbitcoins.
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:16:25


You mean like with drugs? They sure ended that...
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:43:25


You can believe that, sure, but if you actually look at the data, what happens with contraband after it becomes illegal, you would realize it doesn't dissapear and banning something can and often does have the exact oposite effect as desired ie. it becomes more popular e.g. 
Bitcoin isn't even tangible, much harder to find than narcotics or weapons, it will be like trying to get rid of pirated software. I am 100% sure it will be fine. That's not to say governments won't attack it, they already are doing so and will be trying even harder after the next bull run.
If Bitcoin had a real quantifiable negative effect on the US economy, than banning it would be a sign of weakness. Russia and China would go crazy all in with crypto just to weaken the US, they wouldn't ban something that has a negative impact on the US economy. Especially with the "tradewar" going on.

If a company explicitly states they never plan on giving dividends, there is no cash flow and those stocks are also sold to the greater fool...
Yeah obiously they are reinvesting profits(if they have any) but it doesn't mean that they won't ever fuck up, lose millions and go bankrupt. There is no promise that companies will forever grow and stocks will always go up.
For me Investing is looking at earning reports, key indicators, so doing research and then buying into stocks.
Speculating is taking those same stocks and just throwing money at them hoping it will pay off aka gambling.
Point being you can both speculate and invest in stocks, same with crypto.

No, high availability replicating databases are not blockchains. Not even close.
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:09:49
Because a database is not a chain of cryptographically linked blocks? You could store a blockchain INSIDE a database, do you see the difference?
You should read the definition of a blockchain and how they work.

You think ETH wouldn't crash at the same time? lol the whole crypto market would be deep in the red.

With crypto this is not that difficult, you can show the transaction trail from your wallet back to the blocks you mined and any other related transactions when cashing out.
The situation with mt.gox is also possible to explain, you can show transactions to your wallet from the mt.gox wallet, possibly get previous account balance from Mark.
There is definitely some wiggle room with regards to explaining things, if you're smart.
The situation in the article is more because they are shutting up and not saying a word and trying to take this to court rather than trying to explain things.

Of course Bitcoin's value is dictated by supply &amp; demand, this is high school economics and should be obvious.
Do you realize the foreign exchange market(where national currencies are traded) is also based on supply and demand?
There is no magic entity that sets currency prices.
Although some countries do try, a perfect example is Venezuela, there is the "official" Bolivar exchange rate and then you have the actual exchange rate that is based on what you will actually pay/receive.
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:45:54

@_date: 2018-03-27 12:25:03


You can easily exchange Bitcoin for gold, silver, platinum, palladium, if you believe those have "more" value.
The value of Bitcoin, just like the value of gold, is dictated by the fundamental economic law of supply &amp; demand.

The Dave Kleinman theory is much more plausible. He was extremely paranoid on opsec in real life.
He most likely asked Wright(Faketoshi) to error check an initial draft of the whitepaper, which is how Wright came to know about Bitcoin and also why Wright tried to extort wallet.dat files from Dave Kleinman's father. Also explains why Wright is so confident that the real Satoshi will not expose him as a fraud since the real Satoshi is dead.

Once you have a working protocol, an infrastructure, you don't really need others. The internet as we know it was built over TCP/IP v4, created decades ago. If you believe some incredible blockchain waiting round the corner will provide more value, good for you.

Agree that we won't see coffee purchases until lightning kicks in, but for valuable things, laptops, physical gold etc. it's currently perfect, for me at least. Crypto debit cards are also an option for small purchases.

1% tax for EVERY crypto transaction regardless of profit? + on top of that 18%/32% income tax on any profit. In Poland crypto for tax purposes is treated as owning copyright that you can resell.
If you are 20ish years old and rake up millions in debt to the government there is a good chance you will think your life is over.
I don't know what part of the world you are from but that is not reasonable.
We have introduced the most predatory crypto tax in europe by far. Our neighbours just over the border in Germany have ZERO capital gains tax on crypto held for over a year. If you have any substantial holdings it's smarter to move over there just to cash out, that's a big fuck up for the Polish government.

1% tax on every single transaction even crypto to crypto.
Imagine if you've been running a trade bot for a few months and rake up a few thousand transactions(each requires paying 1%) and even if you are at a loss you need to pay them, could be millions.
@_date: 2018-04-20 07:33:12
It's 1% an every transaction in addition to the usual income tax on any profits.

Why not both? You have to earn money to spend money.
Also for every crypto spent you should also pay tax as the transaction usually is Crypto -&gt; Fiat and then Fiat -&gt; Product
@_date: 2018-04-20 07:21:26
I already wrote above that here in Poland owning a Bitcoin is treated the same as a owning copyright. It doesn't compare as owning a copyright is not the same as owning a share or option, do you see the difference? 
It's not even in the same ballpark (ie. financial securities).
It's complete bullshit, instead of outright banning Bitcoins they are trying to make it not possible to use. Our current premier is a banker and he already mentioned at Davos that he doesn't like the concept of cryptos and they should be heavily regulated.
Meanwhile you are trying to defend these taxes as reasonable when you obviously have no idea, you should hope the bankers in your country don't try and pull the same shit.
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:19:53
I love spending BTC directly. Much easier than cashing out and dealing with taxes.
