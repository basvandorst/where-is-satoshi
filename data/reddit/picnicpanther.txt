That's like being around when Microsoft and Apple were starting and being like, "lol you assholes, don't you already know Xerox created a point and click operating system? They're going to be the future of computing."

There is an idea of ideologies falling into three buckets: selfishness, selflessness, and self-interest. Whereas ideologies on the left tend to fall into self-interest ("this helps me, but it also helps out the largest amount of others in the process"), libertarianism is sheer selfishness, hoping that other people's selfishness will counteract lesser selfishness. It's an ideological equivalent of a pyramid scheme.

Donate to Kevin de Leon, he's a progressive trying to primary her!

Kevin De Leon has made his career out of fighting for poor folk, especially in the central valley and LA county. His biggest donors are the Nurses union and the teacher's faculty association. He's far less of a corporate hack than Feinstein and would be an improvement in every way possible. I like Hartson's positions, but she's pretty green—I think challenging Feinstein requires some experience, and De Leon is president of the state senate.

Maybe, maybe not. Depends on how tech savvy they are, or maybe more accurately, how tech savvy their financial planners are.

Man, ancient language seems so archaic and awkward now.

Yep, set some alerts for your high sell price and your low buy price and forget about it.

democrats may be into war, progressives are not. establishment democrats and basically the whole of the republican party is a slave to wealthy, warhawk industrialist donors.
the terminology you're using is all sorts of fucked up bud. progressives were dragging obama for his drone program and hated hillary for her hawkishness.

Hopefully Zuckerberg doesn't cheat them this time.

Yeah, totally libertarian, except for being against gay marriage (calling it a "moral crisis"), against legalization of marijuana (though being for medical marijuana is still better than none), and being a strong supporter of the DEA.

I don't know if you're meaning to be flippant about this, but when Bitcoin has the opportunity to do it better, saying that "USD does it too" is a shitty argument.

Yes, and also, the plane IS the vacation!
