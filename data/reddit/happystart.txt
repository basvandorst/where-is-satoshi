Good use of an advanced technology on something basic. :)

That's not too difficult. Ask Vladimir Putin, for example, to comment something about it first and request the U.S to response. Then most likely the President of the U.S. will response to him. :)

Why you named it "moronic" Monday?
It's not a very good name IMO.. How about just calling it "Q&amp;A Monday"? :)
@_date: 2015-06-29 04:56:22
This is not true. Don't worry. :)
@_date: 2015-06-10 07:25:04
Perhaps I will pay only if a beautiful girl comes to my home to wake me up directly. :)
@_date: 2015-06-02 07:34:46
Just do it before too late. :)
@_date: 2015-06-26 04:40:42
One can say Bitcoin is not very strong right now... but I don't think it is WEAK :)
@_date: 2015-06-11 11:22:46
1. Yes
2. Yes
So simple :)
@_date: 2015-06-05 05:00:52
Happy to know that you way works for your friends :)
@_date: 2015-06-28 08:28:36


Yes, and I also backup the private key of any new address every time I create coz the wallet.dat may possibly corrupt some day later. :)
@_date: 2015-06-12 06:18:19
When the time comes, those affected financial corporations will jump into the new technology faster than you could imagine. :)

I don't run a node (my internet connection is slow so better not to run it), but I still trust Bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2015-06-04 05:10:34
If you want to run a full node, you get to unlock the port 8333 manually.
This is something that the devs may consider to add this option for people to select during installation.

Happy birthday and have a nice day! :)
@_date: 2015-05-07 08:37:29


I am happy that you made that decision. :)
@_date: 2015-05-27 14:53:36
For Multibit (classic), assuming your wallet name is XXX, you can move the file XXX.wallet and the folder XXX-data to another computer where you can open the wallet there.
But if you really have no BTC in this wallet, there will be nothing you can retrieve there.
@_date: 2015-05-02 17:44:48
Confirmation time depends on the priority of your transaction and the network status (how easy to find a new block) at the time you sent your transaction.
It doesn't depend on whether it is an already used address or not.
@_date: 2015-05-04 16:27:42
You can use the command sendrawtransaction to resubmit your bitcoins with a larger fee. It works for me.
But of course you must make sure you do it correctly and include the change address, otherwise you may end up paying too much fee.
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:24:22
Cool. It's a good use of old computer hardware. I remember I also have an old PC and I may try to set up one too :)
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:01:46
Let me be the first :)
@_date: 2015-05-15 10:13:49
This laptop is really too old... but if electricity is not a problem for you, you may just keep waiting until it stops hanging. :)
@_date: 2015-05-09 14:30:33
For only a few dollars, it is "safe" enough to use it for purchasing.
But when you have more Bitcoins one day, you should keep most in cold storage and only a few in hot wallet for normal purchasing.
@_date: 2015-01-31 19:14:49
$1.89 still sounds expensive for a scam coin
@_date: 2015-01-22 07:21:12
Good news. 
Price is up when the bitcointalk is down :)
@_date: 2015-05-20 08:30:27
What will happen? I think Bitcoin will survive even longer. :)
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:36:44
Fed alt-coin will be just USD 2.0
@_date: 2015-05-05 08:30:38
That's strange. Just never heard similar thing could happen on Reddit before.
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:07:19
Thank you for putting these information into a table. 
But now many transactions are not taking only 250 bytes, right?
@_date: 2015-05-06 07:04:39
I guess you are talking about blockchain.info wallet.
You can create a new blockchain.info wallet and then import the old wallet to it.
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:39:19
Thank you. :)
But it seems the blockchain.info URL does not work fully for my addresses. It says: "notice" :"This wallet contains a very large number of small unspent inputs. Ignoring some."
By the way, is it possible to push sendrawtransaction without any blockchain?
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:45:03
Great sharing. I was looking for something like this. :)
But can you or anyone upload bootstrap before the chain split?
I need it so that I can quickly load the wallets without waiting for download the whole blockchain.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:23:41
Great thanks!
Pruned blockchain is good enough because I only need to broadcast the transactions to the network.
Your reply reminds me one thing. I have some addresses having over 100 inputs.It is not easy to gather all the txid:vout pairs manually.
Do you know if there is any tool that can automatically search all txid:vout pairs (from explorer I guess) for a given address and make them ready for signrawtransaction?

How to add other altcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-02 04:37:21
This is pretty serious... Let me share a bitcoin joke here: )
Q: Why did the miner cross the road? A: To follow the other miners.
@_date: 2015-04-30 12:11:17


So the bank made double-spend of people's funds?
@_date: 2015-04-07 10:29:47
If you don't want to run an altcoin yourself (this can also be costly for you to maintain it), you may just pick an existing altcoin as a payment method. There are many altcoins out there.
@_date: 2015-04-09 10:45:22
Most altcoins are of low transaction fees. Some of them even allow zero transaction fee if you have enough coin age (just like Bitcoin). You just need to pick one with active development.
@_date: 2015-04-20 11:02:22
Which VCs told you Bitcoin price doesn't matter "Right Now"?
@_date: 2015-04-11 03:38:20
Because of me. I bought a lot 
@_date: 2015-04-12 08:21:05
If 5% is already enough for your routine spendings, it's not conservative at all. :)
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:21:55
Where is your city? 
Maybe someone else living close to your city can tell if there are more places accepting BTC there.
@_date: 2015-02-04 12:15:00
One billion satoshis... What a big number! Congrats, and can't believe if I can get it one day
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:24:54
It does look nice. Thanks for the hard work.
