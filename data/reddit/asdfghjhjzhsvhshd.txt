So when will it be released in mainnet?

It is called spoofing and used to manipulate the price. It makes people think that there is lot of support, and that the price won't go down very much. These orders will never get filled however, they will be withdrawn as soon as the price goes down. This would be illegal in the regular stock market.

Don't daytrade, especially not with margin. You are only going to lose money.

Colossal if genuine

Given that the UK is leaving the European Union, it might be a good idea to move your business to Germany anyway

Fidor bank in Germany is very crypto friendly. They have a cooperation with bitcoin.de and facilitate trades between users.

This is actually good news.
If bitfinex finally collapses, all the btc that are being stored there will be removed from the market. This will make the remaining btc more scarce and valuable. It won't cause a drop in the price, because there are enough legit exchanges now, that will continue working just fine.

And just a few days ago they created another 300M USDT. As if any person or company in their right mind would deposit that much money with a company that is under investigation for fraud. Definitely something sketchy going on there.

I tried to buy cheese, but I can't reach the checkout page from my phone :(

Just wanted to say that I am certainly NOT feeling alright, and everybody here that claims that losing thousands of dollars over night doesn't phase them at all is a big old liar. And to the people who are going to go say "hurr hue don't invest more than you can lose", I didn't, and I long ago cashed out more than my initial investment, but it still feels bad to lose money. I will continue to hold what I have, but I certainly don't feel bloody alright about this drop.

Maybe he is onto something. The whole tether situation is getting increasingly suspicious. Tether is run by the same people as bitfinex. Since the very beginning they have promised to provide regular audits to prove that each usdt is backed by real USD. They never provided an audit, stopped working with the company that was supposed to do the audit, and now they are under CTFC investigation. And yet they printed another 300 million tether just last week. Nobody with that kind of money would give it to such a shady company. If this scheme collapses, it will be a bigger disaster than MtGox

So I downloaded the wallet and established a channel successfully. I tried buying a sticker from the blockstream store, but I get an error message "Remote failure" and can't do the transaction. Does anybody have the same problem? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:59:02
I had the same problem when using the ACINQ node. Try using one of the bigger nodes from 
That fixed the problem for me!

There is nothing cool about that, 8 hours is too slow.
