Lets take an example of Poker being played by 4 players and all forgot to carry money with them. Now all of them have one blank sheet and a pen in front of them. Everyone is writing on a piece of paper their winning and losses. No body can cheat as 4 sheets can be compared anytime.
The story of bitcoin is very similar as there is nothing physical yet everything is being recorded and prices are shooting.
