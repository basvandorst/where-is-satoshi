Now those 800MH FPGA i bought make lass than .01BTC a month I think....... even the 2-4GH toys I had might make .01 BTC bi weekely?
I know the 60GH is making 0.01 per 5-7days.... 
Then again at this point I use all these toys on new alt coins/start ups because well, mining BTC is crazy right now, its better in invest in start up coins hope they take off (like DRK or DOGE) then sell back to BTC at least IMO

100% agree, I'd like to go back in time and reverse the choice, or somehow get a loan against the BTC instead of cashing out, but then again I own my house outright, and well no matter where BTC goes in the future that can't be taken from me.

Didn't move to a nicer area in theory, just a place that has its head up its ass on taxes, pushing all the school taxes on to landowners, instead of increasing other taxes.
I had a BK in 2010, No one would touch me let alone give me a good rate on my lone.
Cash is king, put the home into a trust and now I have a home that I live in that is protected legally if i ever get in financial trouble again.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. SONNY VLEISIDES
The defendant is hereby placed on supervised release, effective immediately, for a term of three years under the following terms and conditions:
The defendant shall not engage, as whole or partial owner, employee or otherwise, in any business involving loan programs, gambling or gaming activities, telemarketing activities, investment programs or any other business involving the solicitation of funds or cold-calls to customers without the express approval of the Probation Officer prior to engagement in such employment.

Quoting the DOJ:
Public interests will be harmed absent requiring defendants to make available unencrypted contents in circumstances like these. Failing to compel the defendant amounts to a concession to their and potential criminals (be it in child exploitation, national security, terrorism, financial crimes or drug trafficking cases) that encrypting all inculpatory digital evidence will serve to defeat the efforts of law enforcement officers to obtain such evidence through judicially authorized search warrants, and thus make their prosecution impossible.

I am sorry, that is not true, I would take that to the supreme court, 5th Amendment means, No you cant.

The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects witnesses from being forced to incriminate themselves, and there is currently no law regarding key disclosure in the United States. However, the federal case In re Boucher may be influential as case law. In this case, a man's laptop was inspected by customs agents and child pornography was discovered. The device was seized and powered-down, at which point disk encryption technology made the evidence unavailable. The judge argued that since the content had already been seen by the customs agents, Boucher's encryption password "adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's information about the existence and location of files that may contain incriminating information."
In another case, a district court judge ordered a Colorado woman to decrypt her laptop so prosecutors can use the files against her in a criminal case: “I conclude that the Fifth Amendment is not implicated by requiring production of the unencrypted contents of the Toshiba Satellite M305 laptop computer,” Colorado U.S. District Judge Robert Blackburn ruled on January 23, 2012.
However, in United States v. Doe, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled on 24 February 2012 that forcing the decryption of one's laptop violates the Fifth Amendment.

Also the bigger question for many of the future cases, can The DOJ, compel you to Provide your Biometric Data to decrypt your data, while the 5th amendment protects your right to not reveal a password, it doesn’t protect your right not to provide your fingerprint.
And when I get in law school this will be what I work on,
the legal argument is thus: the 5th amendment protects you against having to be a witness against yourself.  For the amendment to apply, the government must force a person to make a “testimonial” statement that would tend to incriminate him or her.  A testimonial statement is defined as a statement that reveals the content of your mind.
And therein lies the issue.  While a password is something you know (i.e. part of the contents of your mind), a fingerprint or DNA sample is something you are! And there for NOT covered.
This is why I do not use Biometrics at all for anything.
