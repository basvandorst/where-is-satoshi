I went in to set a sell order at $19.6k.  Just a little from my wallet because...prudence.  But...it's gone.  I haven't sold anything in four years, so...I guess ill just step back like always and check on it again next year.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:00:52
High fives!  I've been picking up a little at a time since Feb 10.  Averaging down nicely, with a balance of 1.10 BTC now.  
I'm rich!  ^in ^the ^future

6 hours in, and still no movement.
I started a new 0.25 transaction to a different exchange a few mins ago.  We'll see if that goes any differently.
@_date: 2014-02-10 10:32:13
My sources tell me it could be $396.88 on Gox.  My sources also tell me I'm buying with everything I've got if it gets that low.
@_date: 2014-06-02 18:09:51
Such as coinbase.com/yourname?  I realize it's not representative of an anonymous blockchain address, but it's an easy-to-remember wallet address, which is a start. 
And surely there are tools to create and remember vanity bitcoin addresses.  Like a bitly for the blockchain.  I just can't be bothered to search for such a tool on my phone at the moment. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:26:21
This is certainly the most complete, enjoyable, and seemingly plausible theory I've read yet.  Thanks for adding it here.
I remember independently noticing and discussing the buy bot with Opet on TradingView.  We were trying to come up with a name for what we figured at the time was some whale or someone stocking up to start a new exchange.  We just couldn't figure out why they would be purchasing such a stockpile on MtGox (i.e., not privately).  It grew to be quite reassuring (even when nobody was buying late at night, our bot buddy was there).
I suggested some ridiculous pun as a name at the time, but it escapes me; Willy seemed much more appropriate.  I look forward to telling my grandchildren about my role as an asterisk in the "official" history of the MtGox meltdown.
\* One user suggested that the bot be referred to as "Justin Buyber"; this user's ideas were thus totally ignored and discredited.  Because shame on him.
@_date: 2014-02-05 03:44:35
I know it doesn't help anyone who is affected, but FWIW, I have been making smaller withdrawals (in BTC) from Gox over the last few weeks and have had no problems.  As recently as yesterday, I sent some to a different exchange.  The first attempt, I got the "over the limit or not enough funds" message.  I realized I had some open orders that may have been reserving those funds.  Cancelled the orders and then the withdrawal went through immediately.  Heading back now to see if I can clean out the rest of my account.
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:54:31
Thanks, buddy.  Shibes always there when I need 'em.
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:26:43
Cool, thanks for the input about your experience.  Best wishes to you and the people you know there.  
@_date: 2014-02-06 08:44:28
Yeah it pretty much sucks at this point.  I made three withdrawal transactions last night after buying BTC with USD I had left in my Gox account.  First two, totalling about 0.5 BTC are stuck.  No word on them.  The last one (about 0.2 BTC) actually ended up going through immediately.
Of course, with tonight's events, I wish I could have just left the fiat in there and my lower buy orders would be hitting soon.  But alas, that doesn't matter at all until I'm assured that my BTC are coming back to me.  Good luck with yours.
@_date: 2014-06-02 18:13:07
Is that like Mr. Macintosh in the movie Blank Check?
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:10:56
I do wish the fiat that was in my account on Feb 5 was still fiat in that account.  Unfortunately, I converted it all to BTC in an effort to withdraw.  That failed, so now I just have expensive BTC instead of fiat with which to buy 3x the coins.
And yes, this all presumes that they'll be withdrawn someday.
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:06:26
Joke's on them!  I used a false identity to register the account.  Now they have the passport of some dead guy from Milwaukee.  Suckaaaaaaas.
"Hey guys, it says here on the internet that one of these accounts is fake.  Since we can't figure out which one, I guess we should just throw them all out.  Anyway...who's up for a game of hopscotch?"

I can appreciate the excellence of your 4-day submission history, fliend.
@_date: 2014-02-05 05:21:02
Well, an hour and a half in, and the transaction hasn't been posted to the blockchain.  It's only .2 BTC, and I only have about .5 BTC left in the account.  Still holding out hope, but liquidating nonetheless.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:07:25
I wonder, though:  what happened next?  Does your friend have a way to directly support the revolution with a bitcoin donation?  Did he exchange it locally for some fiat currency?  Did he trade the BTC for supplies or services?  I guess, for lack of a better word, who is the Ukrainian Bitcoin war merchant?  Or opposition party supplier or what have you.  I like that one, actually.  Anyway, it's a great use case.
This doesn't sound very sincere, but it is.
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:42:40
And now this:
So...these pretty hollow updates are at least better than silence.
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:34:46
This is a reason that I am not transacting on Gox during all of this.  I still think I'm going to get my coins out of there, and I certainly could have sold higher and now bought more coins as it goes lower.  But I just don't want to give them another damn cent in transaction fees.  If they ever do open things back up, then I'll be able to transfer them out of there, and they'll be worth whatever Coinbase will give me for them, which will presumably be more than they're worth on Gox right now.  I also don't want to lose anything to the A-holes who are placing the big sell orders and stealing everyone's coins in this closed system.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:56:32
You'll need to send your Coinbase coins to a proper wallet address that is to be used for the cold storage paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-05 09:59:25
Sent the final 0.16 BTC to an online wallet, and the transaction posted *instantly*.  So...I was 2 of 3 tonight.  We'll see if the others eventually make it out or get returned.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:55:46
Yep that was my first thought.  Certainly worth the $14.99/mo or whatever until we get any news suggesting otherwise.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:18:46
Indeed, there's one about 50 yards from my office.  The Coinbase price is better, but SXSW is coming, so I expect it to get some good attention.
Perhaps I should do some hot BTC ATM arbitrage during SXSW.  Just sit there next to the machine.  "Oh, you want some coins?  I can sell them to you quicker, for less, and I don't have to scan your ID."
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:24:23
Yeah we're all in that situation with you.  I'm in the US.  I just put a fraud alert on my credit account with TransUnion (for free), and they're supposed to notify the other credit unions so that nobody can create any new accounts in my name or anything.  I'll continue checking my free reports every 4 months, I'll renew the fraud alert after 90 days, and I'll just generally keep an eye on things.
If I start to get particularly suspicious then I'll sign up for one of those credit monitoring services just to catch any changes that may be made to my file.
Oh, and I will be changing my account at the bank under suspicion of fraud.
It's a little nerve-wracking, but I also just think it's one of those things that's a danger on the internet.  You're info is out there somewhere; someone will inevitably find it if they want it.  Best of luck.
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:51:42
Bought some more on coinbase on the dip.  Lowest price I've gotten from them in a [relatively] long time.  It's funny to see the BTC I bought on MtGox for $205 back in October actually in the red...
We all hold our breath.
The silly question I have is:  do I hold or sell Dogecoin?  It has been held up just fine while BTC does its dance.  But if this thing is resolved and BTC pops, I feel like people will be getting out of the Doge (short term) to ride the lightning.
I think I will do the same.
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:22:51
I can't argue that you make (or at least agree with) valid points about certain aspects of the community.  But as someone with a decent stake in the coin itself, I wonder why you are selling all of your Doges.  I wouldn't fault you for growing tired of the subreddit, but from a financial standpoint, the user base does continue to grow, gain attention, attract new buyers, and establish a young ecosystem.  Which is generally good for value.
In other words:  do you think your investment will give better returns in BTC or Karmacoin than in Doge in the short term (say, 3-6 months)?
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:56:13
This is perhaps surprising until I really think about it.  So at what point of UAH devaluation would a decentralized currency be worth considering by folks there?  I know it's far from the point of ubiquity for day-to-day use, but I'm thinking more about reserves.
Or during periods of local volatility like this, do people have an opportunity (or desire) to convert savings (at any amount) into other instruments, like RUB or EUR or USD or something else with more stable value?
I have plenty more ignorant questions, I'm sure, related to Bitcoin and not.
@_date: 2019-11-30 07:36:05
I bought bitcoin from 2013-2015.  Haven’t touched it since.  I was thinking of getting my wife an Apple Watch today, actually.  So...good timing.  Make it so!
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:02:19
I know some folks at big international banks that have been "looking into it" all year.  When it becomes something that can generate significant profits for them without introducing such volatile risk as we're seeing lately, you can bet they'll get involved.  They just don't stand to make much money (relatively) until it's an actual established global currency.  It's like if you walked into your bank branch and asked them for some Bahraini dinars.  Sure, they can get some for you eventually, but they'd rather not bother.  Maybe they'll get to a point where your bank becomes an exchange, and they can charge a fee to transfer funds internationally for you.  But that's small potatoes, and it kind of defeats the purpose.
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:36:26
Yes I'm glad to finally get a piece of that turd.  I've been missing on my limit buy orders for months, slowly chasing it uphill.  The dip gave me the opportunity to get in at long last, albeit at twice the price I originally wanted.  But I'm in the system now.  I can't wait to spend my digital coin...someday.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:13:19
I assume they implemented some sort of cooldown freeze.  The button has come and gone as the price pops a little bit.  But my orders (sells above 900 and buys around 850) aren't firing.  Alas.  Guess I'll just count on holding through whatever happens today.  Carry on, Bitcoiners.  Carry on.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:22:48
I mean, it is kind of interesting, if only because of the timing and the quantities.  Looks like it was a lot of mining revenue all consolidated into this address up until May 2011.  Then in early June 2011 (when the $32 spike happened), it's like they said "Screw this, I'm putting my now-valuable eggs into multiple baskets."
Then it gets divested into many more accounts down the line, mostly in pretty round numbers.  It sits around for a while, gets used in a bunch of smaller transactions through 2012.  Then the biggest chunk that I found ends up here on 10/23/2013 (the day before the Silk Road sell-off):
It hasn't been touched by its owner since.  So...make of that what you may.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:52:54
Oh, well now that you mention that it's on historical lists, I guess Google would be a much faster way to answer this question.  [Bingo](
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:32:57
That's exactly what it seems like to me.  Plus, it gives me all green lights for instant purchase, it says "You can buy up to 1.00 BTC instantly with no waiting," and "You have 10.0 BTC remaining of your daily buy limit."  So, as long as coinbase has coins to sell (which it did earlier tonight), I really feel like it will go through if I cancel that first order.  But I'm hesitant because that doesn't make any logical sense (i.e., why would they not push through my first unverified order?).
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:45:29
That was really the only reason I wanted to give this gift in the first place.  For the hilarity of telling someone that, instead of a tangible gift like a pocket knife, bottle of wine, or R/C helicopter, they are now the owner of *15,000* Dogecoins.  With any luck, though, it will be the most valuable gift of all in the long run!
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:07:09
Yes this.  I'm pretty sure this is a good illustration of the money laundering and tax evasion concerns that a lot of people have with Bitcoin.  Of course, as with the banks, regulators here will just have to work with the exchanges to keep people on the up-and-up.  Which is something both parties seem willing to do.  I think ultimately we'll sacrifice some of the anonymity inherent to the system, but the decentralized nature will still prove incredibly valuable in ways that Caribcoin and people all over the globe are showing.  To the moon indeed.
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:47:23
Big sell orders still popping off.  Looks like my 1099 limit buy (on mtgox) is going to fire.  Wonder if I should cancel.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:28:30
Ha.  Yeah, it seems just like plenty of other markets and commodities at various times in history.  Your chart reminded me of this.
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:42:59
It's falling slowly and not very far (less than 10% movement?  Ha!  Barely raises an eyebrow).  But it's fun to watch buyers and sellers fight over the successive walls on what seems like such a front-row seat.  I never pay attention to the equity markets like this.  I mean, I can kind of see where it's going, and I've got my finger on the Buy button, waiting for that moment (if I'm right).
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:44:01
Just log in to your coinbase account and see how much you have.  I'd imagine you can just keep it there as your wallet for now, since it's not a huge sum.  I mean, worst case scenario, you're out 8 bucks, right?  But most likely you have like $50 worth of BTC, and you can do what you want with it.  Sell it and the value will be sent back to your bank account.  Or use it the way Coinbase wants you to use it, which is to send BTC and pay merchants.  They have an android app that should make it pretty easy.  Look for Bitcoin signs around town and try it out.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:47:12
I realize you asked about investing in cryptocurrencies, but my recommendation would be to find other investments.  Want to get into Bitcoin?  Take some of it that you really don't mind losing, and play with that.  But it sounds like that's some decent money that you can really put to work for you in much less risky markets.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:05:42
Time to quit your job.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:42:39
Let me just throw this out there for kicks, though:  hold onto them.  You've put them into a new wallet that neither your friend nor anyone else can access.  Don't tell anyone else about them, and just hold onto them.  Learn a little about Bitcoin and how to secure your wallet.  Use something like Gyft to buy some gift cards for the holidays.  See which local businesses will take BTC as payment, and buy things there.  The merchant community is growing quickly.  Support some artists or charities that accept Bitcoin.  And then just lock some up for long-term storage just to see if it's worth a lot more some day.  Maybe cash out your initial investment, plus some fun money, using the methods described in this thread.  And then actually use the rest of it as currency.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:48:37
Fuckin magnets.  How do *they* work?
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:52:41
I had Mrs. Johnson's doughnuts last night.  Not only are they probably the best ones around, but they gave me a variety of 8 full size doughnuts and a bottle of milk for like $5.50.  There's no way those old-school folks will be accepting BTC any time soon, though.  They even had trouble with my debit card transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:32:27
To clarify, I currently get the "We've exceeded our buy limits" message with a delay until Friday, and I'm verified.  But I *didn't* see that for a while earlier this evening.  So, I inferred that coinbase had new coins to sell.  But instead of filling pending orders earlier than anticipated, it seems like they were just temporarily accepting new instant orders from verified users.  Ergo, my confusion.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:11:06
Can confirm.  I got mine at 10:53pm PST for $689.63.  Here's hoping it's worth $1400 in the morning.  I realize it's not necessarily a trading platform, but it sure would be nice to place limit and stop orders like I can on mtgox, as there's just as much of a chance of it being $200 when I wake up.  I guess I can just send my coin over there, but...I kind of want to keep my accounts diversified for now.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:17:32
Watch out before you call the sell-off "over".  Things are still a little shaky out there.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:16:26
It has been working for me tonight.  I completed a buy order without too much drama (once verified).  And I've been able to log in and check on it and buy more BTC the last hour or so.  I use Authy for every login.  Never any issue.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:26:54
But is the "we don't have any BTC to sell" delay any different from the "we don't trust you yet" delay?  I feel like I read somewhere that verified users will have higher purchase priority.
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:53:34
Big sell orders still coming.  Just watched 500 BTC sell between 1060 and 1080.  My next buy order is set up at 950.  Kind of hope it gets there.
Sorry for the play by play on an irrelevant spam thread.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:49:35
Dumping a few hundred Btc on a major exchange shouldn't have a noticeable impact at all.  Especially with the number of buyers out there this week.  They'll get immediately snatched up, and life will go on.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:39:35
This is good info.  So I think the next time they have some to sell (when the message goes away), I'll cancel outstanding orders and buy instantly.  FWIW, I also have a recurring buy set up that was supposed to hit today.  There's no info about why it didn't.  I don't think they're scamming me; I just don't think they have defined (nor explained) the logic of their rules in these scenarios effectively.  They're hung up on this pending pre-verified order for no reason. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:38:57
This is the question I always asked about these things.  Why would someone sell an item they produce if that thing can produce ongoing value in excess of the asking price?  I guess the profit margin is consistent and knowable, but at some point don't the folks who sell miners just kick themselves for investing their money in manufacturing instead of BTC directly?
And once you've established the manufacturing processes successfully (using the first round of "kickstarter" preorder revenue), don't you soon reach a level of profit from the sale of miners that you should just re-invest those profits into building your own miners and give up on consumer sales completely?
I'd imagine they do both, and the sales is just a diversification of risks, so they're not completely reliant on the continued increase in BTC value.  Of course, if BTC value doesn't increase, then you lose demand for your miner product.  Ah, the great circle of logic.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:33:12
I had finally bought with a limit order at 205 (during a quick dip to 160).  Sold with satisfaction at 390.  Reluctantly bought back in at 630, but got caught up with coinbase shenanigans when I tried to load up more.  If only I could find the time and attention for day trading.  Or even better, day trading something with more tangible value (i.e., stocks).  But alas, I'm no more than an investor with bad timing.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:02:17
Tonight, at about 12:50am, I saw that the "Friday delay" message was not currently being shown on the buy page.  But I couldn't buy because I still had to complete my first order.  So I canceled that pending order from my unverified days, and I quickly placed a new order for 1 BTC.  It was instantly approved and the transaction was completed.  My coinbase account now has a balance of 1 BTC.  
I'm officially in the 1 BTC/week "Partial Stage 2" beta now.  After 30 days, I guess I'll be able to buy 10 BTC per week.  If only I had done so back when I originally created this coinbase account (BTC was at $90 in April).

There are countless ways you could easily profit from someone else's misfortune and get away with it.  When you turn around an opportunity like that to help someone else (especially a stranger), well, I think we call that character.  Good on you for being a responsible adult.  I honestly don't know what I would do in the same situation, but I could never genuinely criticize you for doing what you did.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:05:05
Maybe I spoke too soon.  There are several big steps down to 1020, but the large sell orders (20-100+ BTC) are piling up quickly.

@_date: 2013-12-06 19:31:57
I think your answer is best explained by the text a little up and to the right of your red circle:  "MtGox Trading Engine Lag: 32m 0s"
I saw a 750 BTC transaction go through, and that (or one of the other big ones like it) must have thrown it into a loop.  So you'll probably see it go around like that until someone over there gives it the ol' Time Warner Cable move.  "Have you tried restarting your computer?"

My guess is that it's just a very early miner (obviously from the dates) with a relationship to Satoshi that maybe went on to use his riches to fund an exchange or some other Bitcoin related business.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:32:46
I mean, clearly if you are offering them legitimately for less than market value just to say you dipped your toes in the pool and now you want out, then anyone here will be happy to facilitate that for you.  You can do localbitcoins.com, which can handle escrow for you and whatnot.  Or you can do something like open a coinbase.com account (or whatever you can hook up to your bank account where you live), transfer the coins there (easy enough), and then withdraw the funds at market price (minus transfer fee) to your bank account.  It might take a few days, but it's pretty straightforward if, you know, you get shaded out by dealing with other over-eager people from the internet.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:45:24
Yes.  That's market volatility.  It was $12 a year ago, and $125 last month.  The $400 increase in a week makes as much sense as a $200 drop in a day.  You can't really be looking for an explanation right now.  It's just the fits and starts of a commodity (as the market is treating it right now) that's getting an awful lot of attention.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:06:58
And here come the buyers, again in at 1050.  Hold strong, fellas!  This is fun, but I'm going to bed.  And again I apologize for my banter.  This is neither the medium nor the forum for this kind of discussion, but it's all I had open at the time.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:04:52
Can't blame people for trying to cash out while the gettin's still good.  But the volume is indeed impressive.  Biggest single transactions I've seen (&gt;700 BTC) in recent memory.  Knocking out those walls all the way down.  We'll see who can step in and catch that knife.  Then, if recent trends hold, we'll see the fire sale buyers rush to the scene, and we'll all breath a sigh of relief.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:11:58
Yeah I was watching it as it happened, too.  Yesterday while it was in the 1200s (MtGox), I had put in a buy at 1099.  As it got close, I canceled that order and split it into a buy at 1050 and 950.  But alas, MtGox somehow didn't cancel it in time (even though the interface confirmed the cancel), and I bought at 1099, which left me with no cash to fill the lower orders.  So while my trading plan was good, my execution failed.  Still bought more coins, though.  Huzzah.
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:02:04
Ah, man.  I did cancel the 1099 order, and then I decided to split the next one into half at 1050 and half at 950.  Unfortunately, when it got to 1050, that's when I noticed that MtGox had not, in fact, cancelled the 1099 in time, even though it clearly gave me the "order cancelled" notice.  Oh well.  It looks like buyers are stepping in with some support around 1050-1060 for the time being, so we'll see where it goes.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:17:07
Sell your BTC for cash.  Wait for the exchange rate to come down slightly (e.g., from 820 to 720, which seems to be happening with some regularity tonight on mtgox).  Then buy new BTC.  You'll magically have increased your BTC balance through the magic of "buy low, sell high."  Maybe you can even buy *two* site subscriptions when you're finished.
Source:  None.  I have no credibility for this type of statement.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:50:20
Well, just buy more with Coinbase.  If you have more there than you feel comfortable with, then to be honest, maybe you shouldn't put so much money into Bitcoin right now.  But if you really want like a long-term investment that you will set aside and not touch for a while, then see the "Security Guide" note in the sidebar, or read up on any of the many "Bitcoin beginner" guides.  Don't do anything until you understand the system and all of the different components and the risks and whatnot.  In my opinion, you're fine with Coinbase for now if all you want to do is buy, save, and spend BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:26:32
That's not altogether true.  I was able to buy some instantly last night.  It seems that, as other users sell their BTC back into the marketplace, Coinbase is able to subsequently offer them for sale.  Their current shortcoming seems to be that they are not filling pending orders with those incoming BTC.  You just have to get lucky with the timing and keep hitting that buy page until the "Delayed 5 days" message goes away.  It might be harder today since there might be fewer sellers since we're off the "peak."

I know you'll get downvotes, but I don't completely disagree.  I think the timeline will be a little longer and the high a little higher, but this seems like the logical sequence of things.  Right now, I think we're still in the talk phase.  A good portion of average people know about bitcoin now, but they're not yet *buying* BTC.  I haven't heard people at work (a software company) or at the barber shop telling me I should buy Bitcoin.  Over the holiday, some of my family asked me about it, but none showed actual interest in owning it.  So I don't think we've seen that surge yet.  Real investors are still holding (or waiting on the sidelines).  They'll wait for the "Average Joe" surge (which, if it comes, will be significant and obvious).  The people who have made enormous profits (and who know how markets tend to work) will start to cash in.  Let's face it; a lot of people have (or will soon have) more money in the form of BTC than they'll need for the foreseeable future.  Once those big transactions start rolling, we'll see the correction everyone knows is coming.
But I do think it will be a little different than previous bubbles.  I think we'll see a lot more people who hold long-term through the volatility.  I plan on making a profit, but I still buy in fully to the viability of the currency in the long term, so I will continue to buy and spend BTC after my investment phase.  It's an interesting time for financial studies, to be sure.
