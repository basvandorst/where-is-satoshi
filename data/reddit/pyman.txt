Lot of assumptions being made that the colloquial definition of debt matches the legal definition what a restaurant bill is(which is actually a form of simple contract debt).  A sign saying no cash would arguably mean that you already agreed to the terms of the contract, which is payment using a card is required at the end of the meal.  This is probably enforceable. 
Lets say you got the contract thrown out though, your debt doesn't go away but the menu prices were attached to the original contract.  The question is how much does your food now cost?  Either way the legal fees to get a ruling makes it a lose lose situation.

...the service they provide is loans and financial advice(for a fee).  Everything else has historically just been a means to raise capital for loan seeds and marketing.  FDIC applies to banks, not the other way around.

Giving cash discounts is also a way to avoid paying taxes on your income.

It's like if a someone in middle school tried to write about finance.

You don't get to say you are only signing as the company when the contract says you the person are liable.  LLC's protect you from the IRS, everyone else laughs and attached a personal guarantee to it unless your company actually has assets.

Volatility is the obvious answer, but for places like Amazon, accepting it means having to explain what it is, how to get it, etc to anyone who hears about it.  Tech support isn't free and the ability to not introduce confusion at the end of a sale has value.

I believe the saying is "Time in the market beats timing the market"
