Simple explanation: it's like gold, it's rare and can't be duplicated.  Gold isn't useful but it's valued as an alternative currency.

What would it be worth if it were only used for electronics and not for money?

I got my verification to go through on my second attempt at GDAX, was unable to add my bank account on GDAX so I added my bank account on CoinBase and then tried to make a deposit on GDAX.  I still haven't had any money taken out of my checking account (but its only been 1 business day) and the "weekly transfer limit used" bar has dropped from 3000/idk to 1011/2000.  Money wires are expensive right?

So if they charge lower rates than visa why wouldn't more businesses use it?

If someone could take this idea and create a business that charges less than credit/debit cards do, could bitcoin really take off to the point where it's accepted just as much as visa?

Sounds like a pretty boring ride.

Money needs to be more stable, not like a penny stock.

Considering how volatile the price has been, I don't blame people for talking about investing in it, but it appears the price is starting to stabilize in the $100 range.  The conversation will shift soon.

Easy to say after the price starts dropping again, lol.

Don't they charge like $5 a trade?
