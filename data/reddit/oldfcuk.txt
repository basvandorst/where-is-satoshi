Boring but I've learned from first hand experience that owning all this kind of stuff is more of a headache than anything.

Retired with 100.. lmao.  You must live in Michigan
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:57:12
Haha you are correct!  
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:52:33
Lots of pump and dump going on lately.
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:08:07
I just recently started and would suggest a few things.  
Don't put it all at the exact same time - especially since I keep reading things about the price hitting the upper 4's and then crashing into the 2's.  (probably bs but still)
Like streamspace said, buy more than just BTC.  I'm putting most my money  in BTC, but read up on ETH and  it sounds just as promising.  I also put a small amount in IOTA which has mega future potential.  
And of course don't put the 10k in if losing all of it bothers you - although if you're smart, you hold long term.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:47:58
Anyone not looking at this as long term is going to drive themselves insane.

Ban this f loser please.

COOL STORY
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:13:52
Unless you were planning to buy 10k+ , the difference in a few hundred doesn't mean jack.  Buy now
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:00:01
20k..that's it??!  I like the sound of 500k more.    I'm not super bullish but I'm guessing 20k 2018.. more like 50k+ 2020
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:53:01
Also check if your card is marking the purchase as fraud.  I logged in and had to verify the transactions before it would go through.

Looks like I'm paying off my home 25 years early.  Sweet!

I'm buying now so that my great grandkids are rich as &amp;

700 btc 150 eth 150 IOTA
diversify like trumps_hairfluff has said here, but still put most in BTC, especially if you're looking for shorter term gains.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:59:41
Yeah, I'm sort of joking.  I don't care whether it goes up or down as I'm going super long term and will continually put small amounts in each week.

Data dash has the best channel on youtube for all things crypto
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:03:09
We do but I'm starting to think no one on here has a flipping clue about what's really happening with the price including myself.
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:34:05
Actually, horse shit did.  It was a huge problem that caused a lot of disease.  
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:46:23
I'm sorry guys.  I finally invested and it immediately nose dived $500.  I was 100% confident this would happen.
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:10:43
CC is instant but limits are terrible and so are the fees.  Use a bank account to buy (takes a week or so to get the BTC but price is set).  At the same time I'd deposit USD into gdax (owned by Coinbase) and use for further transactions as it's free to buy there.  If you are going to buy all $25k at once then I guess just use Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:15:30
That would.be neat! Lol

This is the most spammed Reddit I've seen.

Pay off my debt and keep overhead below 3k a month so I have zero stress.

Every credit union I called said no.

I set it up with Wells Fargo.  Awaiting Coinbase to allow me to deposit funds with my business LLC checking account.  Also waiting for my check from the trust company to clear.. Wells told me two weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:43:51
I was able to open one up at Wells.  It was odd answering their questions about my "business"...lol.  
Are we allowed to buy/sell at any time with this account?
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:20:05
Best article I've read about bitcoin and crypto.  HIGHLY recommended.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:25:26
Yes trust with EIN.  Wells will do it?  Surprising!
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:26:02
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:11:01
Can't remember exactly but I'd assume new account + check from out of state trust company.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:35:12
Did you mention anything about it being for Bitcoin/crypto?  I'm worried if I don't, when trying to deposit funds they may not allow the transaction as some banks/credit unions do that.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:42:49
I've used broad financial to invest my 401k from two companies I used to for.  It's a slow process but easy.  I'm finally on the last step of attaching my business LLC account to Coinbase.  Bitcoin IRA requires minimum 20k.  Broad just charges a fee of $1500 to do it all.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:41:36
Still waiting for Coinbase to accept my paperwork.  Wells Fargo also put a two week hold on my deposit.
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:05:16
If you're interested in day trading, BTC isn't the one to watch.  There are many altcoins going up 20% daily...
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:07:16
If it's only 5k something seriously fucked happened.
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:23:28
This is key lol
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:17:23
They've been playing the market for a long time.  I hope they completely fuck off.
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:09:42
This fat piece of shit has that much?? Wtf?
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:20:40
It's going to keep going until the fork, then take a 20% hit and start a slow but steady increase well into next year.
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:57:45
Who the F*** would listen to someone named Alasdair Macleod?
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:58:17
It'll only drop below 4k again if China bans BTC altogether or the SEC denies Vinklevoss again...I guess November hard fork could screw things up as well?  Not sure where the price would go though.
