It’s not a pyramid scheme - the traditional banking system is
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:31:21
Miners secure the backbone of the network, they deserve payment. Traditional banks are thieves that take fees on money but then rent out  your money and to 100 s of people and get returns not only that you never see an additional dime- if you send a million dollars to someone with banks it could take two, three weeks or longer then you pay massive fees in that .. like 10k or better
Btc has never charged like that or performed renting schemes like that

Well I have been in bitcoin for a while and it’s not the same scene it used to be is all for me 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:30:49
I used to be a miner 3 years the exciting times over hardware and all the mystery, complexity was low .. it was a whole bunch of factors I guess

@_date: 2017-11-19 07:48:01
Ya for sure, I can’t believe he’s back is the thing here

Rofl I built a teraminer network but nothing caught fire lol
@_date: 2018-11-28 13:46:54
Wish I owned 1 bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:59:10
This is a nice post I could use some to get back into bitcoin :)

Probably not just Australia...

well this will prob keep going up a bit .. I am sure a correction is coming though. BTC is due to be upgraded they have to kill off that stupid complexity every two weeks I know that created the miner market but your going to need a hybrid Asic miner in sub 40 degrees to mine. As a BTC trader you probably going to need to wait for a correction don;t buy at this level ..
