It's prone to centralization if the community is passive in discouraging centralization. If we actively punish pools or entities that exceed a given percentage of the hashrate, then we will be at least attempting to regulate the system effectively. We own it. We rule it.

RT does these pieces to weaken the dollar. You will find that RT often airs Bitcoin critique pieces as well, but far less frequently. They don't want to encourage Bitcoin adoption TOO much, after all they have a Ruble to look after! That is not to say that the guests are mouthpieces of the Kremlin, but just keep in mind who pays everyone's salary there: Vladimir Putin.
Historically, Russia has never been very good at propaganda, although subtle attempts through RT have now influenced a generation of mouth-breathers and those ignorant of Russian history. 
I had to get that out. RT blows in so many ways, and the faux-edgy pseudo-intellectuals that support their misinformation attempts are laughably ignorant.

There won't be. I am confident that the maturation of the Bitcoin ecosystem will heavily discourage the future rising of monolithic mining pools, ESPECIALLY if we punish the only one that exists now. Regulation of mining pools by means of community involvement is something that you're just going to have to accept without the benefit of comprehension.

Yes, Russia has NEVER been good at propaganda, but we have a lot more idiots sitting around than we did before. And now we also have YouTube. Combine Russian propaganda with YouTube and you get some of the dumbest fuckers in existence coming out of the woodwork. No offense, of course. I am sensitive to how negatively Bitcoin has been received by governments and media outlets and that is exactly why I despise this segment. I loathe RT in general for the cynical Realpolitik that it reveals at work inside Moscow, but also because seeing this segment in the context of their horrendous reporting ethos makes me sick. They really don't care about Bitcoin. They only seek to sow discord.

I think Roddenberry laid the emphasis on an idealized future where competition over limited resources does not result in conflict within the Federation. That being said, there are episodes of the original series of Star Trek that mention credits. So there's that.

Bitcoin is the victim of its own growing popularity. Most newbie miners are going to get sucked into the biggest and best funded pool. It's funny because while we can certainly blame the miners, and we do, it's actually the (in)action of the pool operators that should be condemned.

No, that's not what I said at all. Also, 60% is far too lenient. Community sanctions should be incurred at around ~40% of 7-day average hashrate, etc.

You are correct, but the Federation itself is post-scarcity because of replicator technology powered by fusion reactors. Many other empires and civilizations in the Star Trek universe still use currencies.

Suppression of Ghash may be essential until competitors have had sufficient time to develop. Ideally, P2Pool takes over at some point between now and then...

I'm sorry, but how are you into Bitcoin if you don't know how to upload a picture?
@_date: 2014-07-14 12:23:27
I disagree. I believe that if GHASH can be kept at bay for a period of time, then competitors would be able to arise much more easily. Chopping down or marring a great tree allows light to penetrate to the forest floor, and to nourish the sprouts and seeds within it.
@_date: 2014-08-02 22:09:55
Correct. I simply meant that the number of pre-purchased Ether rising to 42 million could possibly be a positive portend.

Pending more widespread acceptance, he could donate his coins to particular organizations in the future, so his political philosophy matters somewhat. In any case, I think he's a good guy and that he will eventually use his coins for philanthropic purposes. That way he can move them and use them without the trouble of spilling his identity.

Yeah, but I think $600 is the stability point. I am not very concerned. Not to mention we have an upward draw in China where they might want to see a nice, round, and psychologically satisfying 4000.

This is why I feel that storage, cold or otherwise, in a manmade structure is a very bad idea. Private keys should be hidden in wilderness areas in shallow ponds or under dirt. Strangely enough, this is where Minecraft thinking comes in handy.

In any large attentional influx we are bound to get a few bots, but I feel like it is being overstated. As says below, why subscribe at all? If anything, perhaps this is simply an attempt to raise the profile of Bitcoin on Reddit in general.

I’ve lived a very long, long time; so my name is like a story. Real names tell you the story of the things they belong to in my language, in the Old Entish as you might say.
