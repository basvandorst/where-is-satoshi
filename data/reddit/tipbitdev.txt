Please know that these are testnet bitcoins. You can withdraw them to a testnet wallet, but they aren't worth anything. The primary bot will be updated to use the new features on mainnet when this test bot has been thoroughly tested.

@_date: 2018-01-26 19:57:08
It does not currently utilize bech32 and I haven't tested a withdrawal to bech32 just yet. I'd love it if someone made a testnet bech32 address and tested a withdrawal to it.
No current plans to use lightning, as tipping is already off-chain so it's instant anyway.

While I would agree that the fees are restrictive, the mempool currently is so low that fees are about 30 cents on legacy and even less on segwit... if people want to tip, that isn't going to stop them. 
Implementing lightning is on my list of possibilities, but people clamored for segwit and now I can't even get people to take three minutes or if their day to test it for free through testnet... so please understand that I don't have much of an incentive to implement lightning any time soon
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:58:00

Almost all waiting transactions are below 10 satoshis per byte. Given that 0.000023 bitcoin would be a single uxto, the fee would likely be 0.000023 BTC (230 bytes * 10 satoshis per byte), coincidentally.

Do you mean for deposits and withdrawals? Would that mean anyone who wanted to use the bot would also have to be informed and switched over to using Lightning Network? If so, it's too restrictive at the moment (as no major wallets have LN as a simple feature yet, and won't for another few months probably).
If it can be done without every user of the bot learning a whole new process, I would absolutely love to learn more about implementing it.

As mentioned, there are a lot of new features coming but Bitcoin is attempting to scale slowly and safely instead of going the quick and potentially problem-creating route (the way BCash did) to avoiding fees.
With full segwit adoption coming soon (mid 2018), Schorr signatures to further the shrinking of transaction sizes, and Lightning Network probably partially in-use by the end of 2018... Bitcoin's fees and slow transactions are going to be a thing of the past.
I wish BCash the best of luck once they no longer have faster transactions or a faster network to hold over Bitcoin. I don't know what will really become of them when they have no reason to think they're the best other than a technical point of fitting the white paper a bit better, which is a bit silly to think of as a merit, in my opinion.

@_date: 2017-12-04 19:12:45
You are only partially correct. While bitcoin fees are restrictive for deposits and withdrawals, it should be noted that tips themselves are done off-chain so they are free. If someone is willing to spend the 50 cents or so for the deposit transaction, they can tip freely without fees.
[My bot is currently active and allows easy tipping](

@_date: 2017-12-16 08:48:27
$1 Congrats on the new bot :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:11:04
The fee is only taken out when you deposit bitcoin to the bot. If you deposit 2 mBTC (~$20) you'll get a fee and if you set it correctly it'll probably be about 40 cents. You can then tip any number of times with that 2 mBTC... you could tip 100 people 0.02 mBTC each or three people 1 mBTC, 0.5 mBTC, and 0.5 mBTC respectively. You'll only get the fee on the original deposit.
So the tips are free. Depositing to the bot is where the fee is, and you technically only have to do that once. I would agree though that this is still a problem if people want to only deposit $5 or less worth of Bitcoin. Segwit and Schorr signatures should help curb the problem once enough wallets use it for me to implement it into the bot. Lightning Network will pretty much make my bot obsolete, but that's still a ways off. So for now, the people willing to pay 40 cents for the initial deposit are the only ones I'm going to get to use my bot, which is fine for me at the moment.

This is an unfortunate reality until second later solutions are implemented. With that said, tipping can be done off-chain so there are less fees than would be required with each tip being a transaction...

@_date: 2017-11-20 01:12:12
Tip Status can only be unprocessed or processed. If you have no comment reply on your tip, it's unprocessed or the bot crashed when replying... which hopefully the alpha testing will get out of the way. Rest assured that the money won't disappear due to a crash. It either tips or doesn't... and if the bot crashes I will inform whoever did the crash tip what occurred so they can either leave it or re-tip.
As far as deposits, I could add something that lets you know when your deposit arrives, maybe?

Rate limit issue is solved. It might take a while to get a reply to your comment if it hits the rate limit, but it will post the comment as soon as it's allowed by reddit. If the tip is successful, it is processed right away, so don't just tip over and over again trying to get a response lol

Your point about the currency of tips is extremely valid and I definitely should have realized that earlier. I'll get to work on changing it so that you have to specify a currency (uBTC, mBTC, BTC). As of now, if you put $1 or $5.30 or any other valid int or float after a dollar sign, it does the conversion as close as it can, but I should definitely make it clearer when indicating a tip amount in bitcoin or millibitcoins, etc.

@_date: 2017-11-20 01:18:17
The current issue is fees. Because I have no backing, the bot I've developed doesn't eat the fees. Tips themselves are off-chain but the transaction fee is taken when your deposit goes to central storage, as well as when you withdraw.
I'm implementing a system to enable skipping the storage transaction fee by sending a private key of a wallet the user doesn't mind being swept... it'll take the balance and add it directly instead of detecting when a deposit transaction comes in, so it'll skip one of the fees.
I'll also eventually implement a system to allow the user to set their satoshis-per-byte during withdrawals... but that's only if people really want that. It can cause problems if someone sets it to 5 and then wonders why their transaction never arrives.

That is on my backlog, but it's a very low priority, given that most people are not using lightning, and implementing it into my bot would not add a lot of meaningful functionality.
Tipping doesn't seem to be very popular these days in the Bitcoin community. I don't think adding Lightning would change that, with the current amount of adoption of the lightning network, along with the push-back by the lightning developers on people even using mainnet prior to the system being confirmed to be working properly.

I don't think the BCH tip bot has the exact same command structure. The wiki I linked to should make usage clear, but if anything is confusing, please don't hesitate to ask about it.
As far as the general pattern of deposit, tip, withdraw... yes it works the same way as other tip bots. The commands just might be different in structure.

I'm running one because all of my tip-bot calls are through the Bitcoin Core RPC. :)

I apologize for this taking so long... I've had to learn a lot of this stuff from scratch as this bot was my first python project, my first reddit bot, and my first time working with crypto in code.
[Here is a post from today about the news]( in case anyone is already using the bot.

Since I have Segwit enabled now, I'll probably start looking into Lightning soon. Since tips are off-chain, instant, and feeless already, Lightning wouldn't make a lot of sense for a tip bot, especially considering most people aren't using it on mainnet and the devs have explicitly stated that using it on mainnet slows down their development time.
I'll be looking into programming Lightning anyway because I want to learn it, so perhaps once the Lightning Devs give the go-ahead to use mainnet Lightning, I'll implement it.

It's entirely Python, using Bitcoin Core RPC calls and PRAW as well as a library called Bit. I'll PM you the code in a minute... I have to update the repo with the latest stuff and it takes a minute because I have to clear out any bot-specific data first (like Reddit App passcodes, private keys, subreddit lists it's allowed in, etc)

At the moment I'm looking among my programmer friends for someone who can review it. If there was a bug I couldn't see that enabled someone to steal funds, I'd rather have someone I know well enough to trust see it so that I can fix it before I release the source to the world.
With that said though, I do plan on making it open source in the next few months.

Holy hell, I really could have used this two months ago...

When it becomes normal for people to have active lightning wallets on mainnet, possibly. Right now almost no one is actively using lightning on mainnet so I have no real incentive to implement it. In fact, we shouldn't be using lightning on mainnet at all according to the developers, and I wouldn't want to encourage people to do so at this juncture.

I think you might be overstating things (people barely tip BTC these days), but I appreciate the input and I'll definitely keep it in mind.

The minimum withdrawal on [my Bitcoin Tip Bot, tip_bit]( is currently 0.5 mBTC, or 0.0005 Bitcoin. I set that value when the fees were really high, so I could probably remove the minimum entirely and just include a disclaimer about the fee (there is a method for determining the fee prior to withdrawing, so people can use that).
But currently it's 0.0005 Bitcoin.
For anyone who is below the minimum, I can do manual withdraws if they PM me.
