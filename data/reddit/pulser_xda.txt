Had a look - can confirm what was posted here. Basically, someone with access to the MaidSafe MSC exodus account (1ARj...) sent 20,000 MSC to an intermediary address (17b4...), which then sent the funds on to an address (1Np...) that purchased further Maidsafe coins. 
Quite why this happened seems strange - 20k MSC is approximately $950,000. So it's not a tiny amount moving around... 
Edited to add start of addresses. Writing from mobile so I just put the first few characters of each address.

Fun fact: You can actually reset your password with iForgot, and then restore it using a totally new device, with a totally new SIM.
So if it's actually encrypted, and not stored in plaintext (which I suspect it is), it's stored using little more than your 2 security answers... But even then, in light of incidents like this ( I suggest that this is enough proof that Apple isn't encrypting the keys.

This suggests it would be trivial for Apple to recover them. 
And given the ways an iCloud password have been reset before, it suggests there is no protection on the keys, AND that the keys are stored on Apple's servers. At the very least, a totally new device can read all past messages, after forgetting and resetting your password... That suggests something untoward is going on.
