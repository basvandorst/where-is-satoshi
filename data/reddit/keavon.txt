As with any investments, on average, you will always lose money to those who can/do spend more time and effort than you to learn and make informed predictions. The money isn't free, it just changes hands to those more adept with the market. If you can beat the average trader (weighted by volume) in their understanding of the technology and economy, then you could potentially make money, on average. But that is only an average, and you can easily stand to lose big either way (or win, if you are lucky, but gambling is not a prudent path to get rich). But remember there are many professionals out there trading in high volumes, so you need to be at least mostly as smart as them for any luck at all to be in your favor.

I get the concepts behind Bitcoin, nodes, and how AWS nodes aren't real votes of consensus. But could you briefly explain the politics of this? I haven't been keeping up with the details of the fork and the different protocols and competing politics. I'm just used to the good old Bitcoin of 5 years ago. What has happened since, what is the chronology is the major proposals, and what is the contention being discussed here?

How about TOTAAL? TOTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL?

ULA? ULA isn't involved with SLS, could you clarify your question? ULA is focused on building Vulcan as their rocket of the future to replace Delta IV and Atlas V, with cheaper production costs (and eventually partial reusability) in mind. SLS is just the pork barrel rocket with no mission, quite the opposite of Vulcan (although it's ULA's goal to get governing funding to apply towards building Vulcan where possible).

Oh, I was not aware they produced the upper stage. Thanks for the link.

That's a really old plate design, so this was probably from before Bitcoin even existed.

Really? I've never heard or noticed that. Where can I learn more about it?

This almost sounds like it's from /r/nottheonion
