everyone wants cheaper bitcoin
@_date: 2018-09-24 09:03:26
mt gox trustee has sold what needs to be sold, its done, regardless demand is higher vs 2014/2015. Sticking with the flat market prediction until jan next year.
@_date: 2018-09-24 09:34:20
Well they have all the fiat needed for claims and the most likely outcome is the rest of BTC distributed as BTC it seems?  Information is coming from mtgoxinsolvency - how closely are you following this?   Either way they dont have an unlimited supply to sell.  
@_date: 2018-09-24 09:31:02
wow pretty insane
@_date: 2018-09-18 15:39:04
you are here
@_date: 2018-09-23 20:47:16
i see people trying to force a bear market aswell
@_date: 2018-09-05 07:57:02
well you didnt mention a time frame in your text so yeah... the high point = 20k until you state a time frame
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:23:13
not if you want to buy more
@_date: 2018-09-23 21:07:43
We wont get lower prices while there are tons of people wanting lower prices, we can just go flat for months before bull run.  People are still really positive on bitcoin and the halving is now just 600 days away.  Only people selling now are miners to buy more mining equipment.
@_date: 2018-09-23 10:08:15
cheap coins for everyone
@_date: 2018-09-02 08:04:47
we were at 20k, went down to $5.8k, thats decent blood
@_date: 2018-09-03 09:44:43
its not 20k
@_date: 2018-08-30 17:47:13
I find Youtube is more real/organic/relatable to all other tv/film format platforms.
@_date: 2019-03-17 16:27:34
You think i knew about Bitcoin when it was $1 or less?
@_date: 2019-03-14 15:53:49
great post
@_date: 2019-03-14 16:02:56
He puts money in bitcoin in the first place because he sees value.
@_date: 2019-03-17 14:31:11
That quote is exactly what i predict and also hope will happen with governments.
@_date: 2019-03-17 14:28:47
bitcoin being successful was much easiesr to predict vs winning lottery ticket numbers
@_date: 2019-03-17 14:27:30
we used to have 0 of you and now we have 1
@_date: 2019-03-26 10:36:16
At this point in the cycle its mostly the miners who sell at this point to pay for mining operation. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 20:45:35
would you bet your dick on that ?
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:49:45
I dont know exactly the bottom but time is running out, the halving is may next year.
@_date: 2019-03-07 13:08:43
 Some wonder who they are. So dumb I are 
@_date: 2019-03-02 21:08:00
What you think is the % chance we hit $100k some time in next 5 years?
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:53:26
you must be new
@_date: 2019-03-02 08:49:22
its like everything you put btc into, small amounts at a time.
@_date: 2018-10-17 20:27:02
the miners start to hodl
@_date: 2019-03-17 16:29:04
Hanging around bitcoin forums if you dont see bitcoin has an edge seems foolish to me.

Hey Naomi, Wanna jet back to my place and pop in a blu ray?
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:21:36
So who is watching the watcher watchers?
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:10:18
ebay + paypal ends up with like 14% total in fees if i sell something 
@_date: 2018-10-16 18:40:01
The halving is coming soon
@_date: 2019-03-01 08:44:37
Alex jones = unreliable source of information
@_date: 2018-10-14 16:51:21
how do u make profit?
@_date: 2019-02-17 19:57:42
how does $200k a coin next bull run sound to you ?  dotcom bubble was multiple trillions made by largely US investors.
@_date: 2019-02-22 15:15:18
  " If you bought under 4k you are yielding around 8%  "
How does that statement even work ? some people bought at $1 
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:52:24
Enjoy your 8x gains lol - rookie numbers for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:54:11
what is it then ?
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:31:57
I had to sell some also and do what you did.  Its market forces and deal or no deal problem. Nothing wrong with taking some profit.
I cant not hold some coin though it makes me panic about as much as not owning a house.  I thought thats why you might be here... the FOMO.  
@_date: 2019-02-22 15:01:59
zero? lol ok, hope you get back in before $10k
@_date: 2019-02-04 18:25:53
bring back GBP
@_date: 2019-02-18 18:31:28
what about the 2024 halving ?
@_date: 2019-02-22 13:10:17
If bitcoin were to only go to $100k 1 in 20 times you still gain an edge from buying at current price.
@_date: 2019-02-22 11:51:07
Change the ape, bitcoin obviously has potential. Rest is funny.
@_date: 2019-02-22 20:01:17
Im not against it its just impossible to use unlike bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 20:11:15
Any signs of USD cracking could spark a pile into BTC.
@_date: 2019-02-22 14:32:24
what you think odds of $100k bitcoin are ?
@_date: 2019-02-03 21:09:20
@_date: 2019-02-05 20:37:31
Big youtube channel talking about bitcoin, ok with me
@_date: 2019-02-22 14:50:33
Everyone who bought under $4k in the last 10 years is also not "wrong". 
@_date: 2019-02-18 22:06:09
1% of the world invested in crypto at 20k? i find that hard to believe it was even that high a %.  Any source for stats ?
@_date: 2019-02-22 20:15:42
Its somewhat redundant because BTC would increase dramitically in value if the USD starts to crack where even $300 = a basket of groceries within next few years for example.
@_date: 2019-02-01 08:44:22
I agree it shouldn't have been so big a drop but the fall and rises follow the numbers no matter what it seems.  Just like bitcoin will start going back up again at some point not really caring about much of whats going on.
@_date: 2019-02-01 18:46:30
a low % will sell at 6k and 10k etc, most hodlers would be looking for very high numbers not prices we've already seen.
@_date: 2019-02-22 15:43:36
Yet you buy in at $2k for what? just gambling? 
Those people who buy at $1 are lucky to be at right place at right time but they probably bought in because they thought price can go higher just like you did. 
You are not the only one who has sold coin for decent profits FYI and are either here for ego stroke or suffering from FOMO of next bull cycle.  
@_date: 2019-02-22 15:18:38
Thats a speculation im not willing to take and you are here talking in a bitcoin forum. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 09:57:50

he has a triangle, triangles mean stuff
@_date: 2018-11-10 10:37:46
What if the dude is investing several hundred k? in next few weeks? could take forever sending things like 5k etc
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:50:07
The lower we go the higher the risk is it wont go lower.
@_date: 2018-11-21 09:54:04
Everyone comment in r/bitcoin is from someone who wants more bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:09:18
lol i just dont believe you, yall want cheap BTC
@_date: 2018-11-10 11:00:00
When we broke the dickline support we stayed flat while the dickline just kept on going straight up.
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:44:50
@_date: 2019-01-29 14:38:38
me four
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:02:10
They missed out on the bull run to 20k then.
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:13:54
Its the best predictor we have 
@_date: 2019-01-30 06:46:17
ok ty
@_date: 2018-11-10 11:03:09
The dickline is the real honey beaver.

im not going to some strange link just post the story here please.
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:07:38
Provided the fundamentals stay the same basic math proves this.
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:00:25
I only care about making gains, not what people want to call it with words.
@_date: 2018-11-30 12:35:09
we already been there
@_date: 2018-11-15 11:52:26
he not desperate bro, the guy loaded/successful already
@_date: 2019-01-01 13:30:55
just keep buying 
@_date: 2019-01-26 18:48:43
For sure, its like people think we are just going to stand still and not evolve.
@_date: 2019-01-30 06:45:53
ok thanks just hoping OP is not somehow legit and his bank targetting them for not much reason.  Either way kraken gave him chance to withdraw so i guess kraken is fine. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:54:53
only if you are talking philosophy and not probability
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:32:59

@_date: 2019-01-29 22:23:40
im still a bit confused as not everything is clear
@_date: 2018-11-09 08:47:44
Bitstamp wont turn up their nose when they see this thread creeping up r/bitcoin.  100% confident this gets solved quick, watch what happens.
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:37:15
