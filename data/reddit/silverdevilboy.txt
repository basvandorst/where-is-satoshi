Google wasn't first. It was best. Bitcoin will stall at the point of becoming legitimate currency unless it can solve a lot of its current issues.

Except for the arbitrary measure.
If I was posting that apples were now worth more than a microgram of gold, you'd look at it and say 'that's a pretty dumb post, they just picked an amount of gold that costs about as much as an apple and waited for the price to go above it.'

But what constitutes a unit of gold HAS changed from the last half a dozen times the price of an arbitrary measure of gold was exceeded. Per gram is the most used measure of gold.
If someone sees that diamonds cost more than X precious stone, they're not going to think about whether there are more or less diamonds than that precious stone on the market. They just assume the more expensive one is rarer.
If someone cares about the comparative rarity of the objects, they get more information from the market cap. If they don't, then the comparison is very misleading, as it implies someone with a lot of gold is poorer than someone with a lot of bitcoins. In either case, comparing unit price of something when the rarity is very different is not helpful to anyone.

Taking scarcity into account when comparing unit price is literally what comparing market cap means. And most people absolutely do not do that with respect to gold or to bitcoins.

And I'm talking about other ways that the government officially acknowledged that BTC has value.

We only have to pay taxes on those bits of paper if we get more of the bits of paper.
The only reason anyone would get taxed on bitcoin is capital gains tax, which means the government is acknowledging the value of bitcoin.

Not true, if you gift someone bitcoin then they would have to pay capital gains on it at the value of the bitcoin. Same thing with shares.

The fuck you doing at the top there? You don't even have the correct number of steps!
