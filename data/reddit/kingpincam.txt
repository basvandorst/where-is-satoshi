Thanks dude! I was originally going to post the full podcast link. However, I thought that clip provided some crucial information for those people that don't have the time to watch the full duration of the podcast :)

Lol :)

Been listening to him since PowerfulJRE  back in 2014.

I would say it's pretty risky. Not too much info on the net anyway regarding the bot success, legitimacy or creator/s. If you were to put some money in, I'd recommend only investing what you're willing to lose - almost like you were betting red or black on roulette! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:48:04
Absolutely! He's a super intelligent guy.

It's somewhat of a catchphrase for Joe to refer to people as "powerful" as a mark of respect throughout the PowerfulJRE podcasts.

Andreas 100% - albeit the JRE w/ Dan Bilzarian as a guest was pretty damn enthralling too!

It's on my bucket list to be a guest on a JRE of the future haha!
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:21:58
Hey no problem buddy - I'm glad you enjoyed it!

It's a daunting concept for a lot of people. I would predict that cryptocurrencies will become more mainstream and more accepted to use for day to day transactions throughout next decade in the 2020s!

Sure, here is a link to the full podcast on YouTube 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:29:45
It would be great to see him return soon :) 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:33:15
Agreed :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:53:14
I can see why, invaluable content from a very articulate Andreas who is also a great speaker and is easy to listen to. His ability to convey complex ideas in such an understandable fashion is remarkable in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:35:51
Absolutely! :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:28:21
Neither do I, he's such a visionary man with phenomenal ideas that could change the entire world for the better.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:34:25
Damn that takes me back haha! Yeah Joe presented Fear Factor back in the day :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:37:49
It is quite old! I posted it because there might have been people who missed it when the podcast was initially aired and the info is still relevant today! Hopefully Andreas returns soon :)
