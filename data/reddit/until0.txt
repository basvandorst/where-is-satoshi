It's no different with any other asset that appreciates. The government loves it's money.

He would still need to pay taxes on his gains...
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:37:27
No, a capital gains event. When you use Bitcoin for goods or services, it is recognized as a sale of the Bitcoin and you would pay capital gains tax on the difference.
For example, let's say you bought 3 Bitcoin for $10 each. Bitcoin hits $1,000 and you use .1BTC to buy a $100 Amazon gift card. You then own capital gains taxes on the price the Bitcoin appreciated, in this example, it's $99. 
This is agnostic of any sales tax you may pay on the goods or services being purchased. You pay taxes on the appreciation of your Bitcoin, regardless of it exchanged for fiat, or goods and services.

The elections could implement minimum karma requirements as well as 
a long-standing subscription to the subreddit. Reddit is already well versed in dealing with vote manipulation as well. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:49:29
I'm pretty sure the gains are still recognized in this instance as well, but not certain. Bitcoin is considered a property, not a currency. It would use the market value of the service/item to calculate the gains. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:50:35
The karma would be calculated off the subreddit in question, not the user's total. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:53:27
No, simply using Bitcoin for goods is a taxable event. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:43:40
Yup, that is correct. Bitcoin Core is the wallet software and when you request a new address, it picks from the pool of generated addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:50:22
I think you meant to reply to a comment here, but instead you submitted it as a top level one. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:47:40
A wallet is simply a collection of stored private/public key pairs. By default, Bitcoin Core generates one hundred key pairs during initial creation. After exhausting 100 addresses, the wallet needs to be backed up again. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 20:49:46
This is absolutely terrible. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:51:43
Everyone is down voting you, but what you say is quite true. It will only be a commendable achievement when Newegg actually retains the Bitcoin received. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 23:01:25
This doesn't make sense. With this "logic", all of our currencies have been nothing more than livestock, metals and paper. Currency is the idea of exchanging, the mediums of exchange are irrelevant. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:18:39
How does it top it off without generating new keys? Does this only happen when using the Backup Wallet option of the Qt client?
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:54:09
His point is the company immediately trades the Bitcoin for fiat meaning they truly do not value the currency, only the Fiat behind it. If Newegg actually retained the Bitcoin they received to use for future investment in the company, that would be the ideal situation. It shows that companies see value in the currency beyond its current capability to be converted directly to Fiat. His point actually makes a lot of sense. 
It would be like if I accepted cash, but instantly converted it to Gold because I did not trust the US economy. It's nothing more than a barter. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:10:42
I truly understand that and do not disagree with the logic. It just seems the original post is more along the lines of, "We don't have time for tipping since we are too busy being official."
I found that to be offensive since being official, creating regulations, tipping and having fun do not need to be secular activities. 
I will say that BTC is less likely to be tipped for other reasons though such as the fact is it not easily mined and a single unit has a significantly high value. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:51:05
That is most of the Internet, why are you here on Reddit?

I think he is referring more to malware on your computer listening for the new key. With this new method, everytime you send a stealth payment, you have to hope your machine is not compromised. 
It could also be the network you are on. With this method, it is almost impossible to send over a public network. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:08:48
Your comment implies that all the dogecoin community does all day is tip and nothing else productive, which is simply untrue.
There is a best of both worlds. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:59:51
Adhering to that logic, this is true. Newegg has an agreement with those payment providers in which they will receive Fiat for those transactions. Newegg does not accept credit, those providers do. Newegg solely accepts Fiat.

I'm not sure if would be interested, but this seems up their alley. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:40:46
How does one do this? 
@_date: 2014-07-01 23:37:08
Exactly. Its definitely a win for bitcoin as awareness increases as well as the number of transactions, etc. 
It seems that everyone replying to his original comment is debunking his claim. I understand the reason he is down voted as his comment has a negative feel and is  counter productive in its regard. One thing that will not help though is a false understanding of the currency and our end goal though.
The ideal situation would be for them to retain the bitcoin and not exchanging it for an alternate currency. It would be hard to bring light to this though considering the overall attack brigad of this comment thread. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:10:18
Years? Sure about that?
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:18:40
This sounds sketchy. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 20:13:55
I'd assume it's because almost anything on the web has the potential to affect you with malware and one should always be cautious. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:56:13
Wouldn't I then need to back it up every send to get the newly generated private key though?
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:36:09
Well the price isn't really relevant. The only benefit to Litecoin over Bitcoin was ASIC resistance, which is no longer a factor. It's subjected to the same scability problems as Bitcoin and is nowhere near as fast as Ethereum. At this point, it has nothing going for it. The only saving grace is the creator and figurehead is the CTO of Coinbase, which has proven it to be a worthwhile investment previously. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:21:25
I would look to make the CSS less..... well, 90's. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:02:22
LTC is pretty worthless, I say that as I hold them too, so it should speak volumes. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:33:24
Can you buy with USD on Bittrex or Poloniex?
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:08:22
Even ignoring the potential shortcomings of USDT, how do you buy the USDT with USD?

This is an opinion article, it's stated on the bottom. It's not "on record with Nasdaq".
