Why would it matter if bitcoin keeps rising? People can use it as a savings account for example and turn it into cash whenever they need the money. Don't we all win from this or am I missing something? Ofcourse people will be reluctant to make unnecessary purchases with their bitcoin but I think that's exactly what the world needs to become sustainable.

Bitstamp seems to be down too. Too much traffic I guess and people panicking. Hopefully I can manage to log in soon and buy lots of bitcoins at ~$150 or so. :p

You can have 0.000000001 bitcoins to trade or purchase things with, so it's not true that only few people can possess them.

DDoS or not, fact is we're now succesfully being conditioned to start panic selling whenever there is lag. This also means people can abuse and manipulate this to their advantage, if they haven't already today.

Don't worry if you're in it for the long run $262 per btc is nothing. When prices go up this fast people tend to panick just as fast. :)

The market won't crash, too much demand and too many people waiting to buy in when the price does come down. So we can expect to see some corrections in the near future, but the price won't come down by more than $20 any time soon because when that happens people will be buying them up like crazy again which causes the price to bounce back up.

The lag was there before the price started coming down fast. The lag just became worse and worse and then people started panick selling before the lag became so bad that they couldn't trade at all. A correction was definitely due but I think the lag triggered all this build up tension to release.
