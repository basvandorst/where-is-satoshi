I really doubt it. Why would he use his real date of birth when he is trying to stay anonymous? If I were him I'd either filled in January first or rolled with dice.

This is the stupidest thing ever. Nice try to drive the price down.
Anyone with any brain can understand that people downvote the other submission because it's senseless, not because they actually believe that.
But go ahead and knock yourself out with this great news. Perhaps the WSJ will pick it up.

But if you said it, you'd be right ;)
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:15:45
If that is against the Reddit rules, then the OP is too.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:40:20
Not working for me. My browser automatically deletes cookies and localstorage and etags and whatnot, and when I opened the page it said the same.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:35:55
Right, but, wouldn't it have been equally easy to use the name Joe Johnsson? Think of something random and unique enough and you're good, no need to use a former name at all.

Don't confront him, but I'd like to ask keeping an eye out when you're near. I think he might be able to use it.

I would just love to see her go into hiding. It's what she did to Satoshi Nakamoto. Eye for an eye. Don't tell me it's unfair.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:39:26


Or just not harass his family for any and all details about him. That's what struck me most actually.

Are you saying we should buy like maniacs because we'll be able to transfer it out this week? :)

Tell him that there is a legion of hackers waiting for any sign of what we can do to help him, myself included.
@_date: 2012-12-13 11:37:50
So how do we know that they'll accept it soon? Shouldn't it link to the news instead?
@_date: 2012-12-13 12:02:37
Or the Bitcoin StackExchange.

Well, malware that mines Bitcoin is bitcoin-mining malware in my opinion. You might want to change the terminology for making a better impression of Bitcoin, but it's a correct statement. The argument for "there is no such thing as bitcoin-mining malware" is that there are just tools, and tools can be used for good or bad. Following this idea, you could also say "There is no such thing as malware - there's just software that can be used for good and bad."

Trading Bitcoin, then trusting third parties to handle your money. It's a working way to donate in Bitcoin, I guess we can trust that website to really forward our coins, but you might as well donate another way because this just neutralizes one of Bitcoin's advantages.

Guess my mind works reversed; I am rather surprised people didn't back out after the halving, dropping the price. Why would it go up?
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:41:10
No, once a bubble pops it's popped. But new bubbles can form...
See July 2011, that was the previous one. If you look at the magnification of that one compared to the last bubble, I wonder how big it's going to get next time.
@_date: 2013-03-18 19:57:55
tl;dr 32 minutes nothing happened. Most exchanges limit the amount you can trade at once anyway.
@_date: 2013-02-23 17:09:22
Wow, reading this, it's fascinating to see how money is being traded. I never looked at it this way: with a public blockchain you can do detailed analysis of cash flow. Before you would have to ask a bank to find out how much money was being transferred every day, and that would be far from exact because of cash money. A twentieth of the entire currency changing hands every ten days is not little. You could even analyse how often this twentieth are the same people, and how much is being hoarded.

Yes it's nice to see they defend Bitcoin itself as well as themselves. But then this nice thing might happen that governments can do when they're said to be unjustified in a request: they just change the law and then close you down instead of warn. Might be interesting to try and see them seize Bitcoin itself, but the Bitcoin Foundation is a legal entity that _can_ be shut down.

So then how do you revoke letters that you wrote and sent? Email doesn't sound like much of a change.

I'm not sure how "Magic" goes with a general audience, but I'd just frown and think nothing good of it.

This article is one big piece of sarcasm, right? I cannot make sense of it otherwise. Looking at the rest of the website, they seem to try to be a respectable website, so it also doesn't make much sense to me to publish a sarcastic article.
@_date: 2013-03-10 00:34:54
Or, more likely, "Sounds like either a fraud or a bubble"
@_date: 2013-03-10 00:33:37
Who says you have to convert it back to Dollars or whatever?
@_date: 2013-05-25 16:24:10
I see what you did there
@_date: 2013-07-01 02:32:02
I thought I was the only one ever making obscure bash.org references, only in my case nobody gets it. Reddit is awesome.

Didn't watch the video. This addition to the title just makes me go "so much for wanting to get feedback..."
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:21:35
Didn't our Dread Pirate (the original) own some huge amounts of bitcoin, much of which the FBI recovered by finding the wallet?

Note that some people only know the term "peer to peer" from file sharing and may associate it to varying degrees with illegality. Replacing that with "regulated by its users" might also sound like anyone can do any bad thing they want, so perhaps leave this part out altogether. Or say something about cryptography, that'll shut most people up and think it's safe. Or the techies will ask and then discover it's safe :)
@_date: 2013-03-10 00:34:22
Then they'll be like "Why the fuck if we have Paypal?"
