Do a basic explanation on the blockchain
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:22:17
I would have to be put into an asylum if I lost the key to a wallet that has 255 million dollars worth of Bitcoin on it....
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:26:29
Completely off topic, but that picture is amazing.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:02:04
I meant like we finally hit 4k from all of the high and low days we’ve been having over the past months
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:05:31
Oh ok. Thanks for clearing that up.
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:57:26
Sorry if I wasn’t clear enough, I know what mining is but isn’t there a limit to the amount of Bitcoins that can be mined since it’s based off of gold? How do more just magically appear?
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:26:34
Might I ask how new bitcoins just appear? I don’t understand 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:09:35
No, it's not.
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:18:40
No, not to the moon, waaaaay farther than the moon.
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:23:14
It doesn’t seem to be doing anything. I mean every now and then someone pokes it with a stick and it moves but ya know
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:31:26
There has to be one person that was crazy enough to buy thousands of bitcoins when they were ~$5 and now they’re crazy rich
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:06:26
that's DACA my dude
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:35:49
If you have Adblock 
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:08:40
Been waiting a while but hey I guess the bubble finally burst
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:30:12
$2900 maybe $3000
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:09:02
I can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic or not, seriously.
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:11:12
No, I don't. It's all I have at the moment. If you're going to fucking hate on a 13 year old go fuck yourself you no life asshole.
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:00:18
What if I don't panic sell when I do buy?
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:01:20
How is that profitable?
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:56:52
What about ZCash? Sorry for bothering I don’t know how all of this stuff works. How can I learn?
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:56:52
Oh look, you again. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:53:21
I can’t tell if you’re being optimistic or you actually know your stuff. Hopefully the latter.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:15:38
I’m 13 and right now I only have 2.26 from ZCash mining. I have 50 bucks coming through because of an item I sold on eBay, but I don’t really want to lose that...
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:23:48
No it’s fine. I know how to program so I’ve got that going for me. I’ve also completed an MIT computer science course and finished with a 96% so I’ll get somewhere.
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:25:47
Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:30:06
I got the money back into my wallet. I have $2.26 right now. How much do I need, and what's the best exchange?
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:41:53
But I’m trustworthy. I literally just want Bitcoin because other places require an ID and I’m only 13
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:54:25
I’ll take your word for it. What about other cryptos?
@_date: 2017-07-27 23:38:43
I don’t have Bitcoin right now only ZCash as I’m waiting until I have 0.05 to shapeshift into Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:30:06
In 7 days......
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:28:41
RemindMe! 1 week
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:17:36
Please tell me you don't actually believe this crap.
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:56:22
Thanks for the support asshole.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:46:18
No, I haven't even bought yet. I'm new to Cryptocurrency in general.
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:51:59
So you’re saying that it’s going to jump up again?
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:03:35
Never trust someone? So what you’re saying is not to trust you?
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:34:57
I can’t tell if you’re joking or not, because I don’t know a lot about how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:07:06
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:39:10
Call your bank first. They might have you transfer small chunks of the money in at a time. But then again I’m 13 what do I know. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:40:13
Thanks for calling me an idiot :P 
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:15:40
I have $2.00 on Kraken but it says I have insufficient funds when I try to gets just 50 cents worth of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:22:03
Neither of my parents will buy me something over $20 unless it’s my birthday or Christmas. My mom and dad aren’t together. My mom only makes like 30000 a year
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:08:28
Ok, chill!
