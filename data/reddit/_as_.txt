it solves most, if not all the problems, which the fiat systems have, currently. Additionally, it makes all participants equal.

It is not about the consensus finding (ppl issue). The base lined principles of the blockchain should not be broken. 
If you are allowing it to the lightning network, then, if tommorow, another one comes with a better solution, you should allow it also to make changes in the first layer protocol. Doing so, you are arising new unknown questions, beside of going against the principles.
So, any upgrade of the protocol should follow the strict guidelines of baselined principles.
