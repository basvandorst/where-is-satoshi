Literally incorrect he explained that his dad got money for creating a potential future tax payer

These idiots think that UBI will work. Have to tax someone or print the money. It won’t work. 
Edit: looks like it will cost 4 trillion at least. 
12k x 325m Americans 
At least it’s not the green new deal �� which will cost 93 Trillion 
@_date: 2019-03-17 02:41:24
I saved over 3k last year. 
I’m not wealthy 
It benefited a lot of working families. 
We DO absolutely need to reign in spending tho

More like “I worked hard and earned it, so you can too. If you want to be lazy and try to legislate yourself free money, you can go fuck yourself”
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:37:57
Everyone’s on his dick because he wants to give everyone 12k a year as UBI...
Lol �� 
@_date: 2019-03-17 02:07:32
4 trillion x 7 would be 28 trillion. You’re an absolute retard if you think we spend that on defense.

They’re both fucked honestly. Bernie’s a nut case and a huge hypocrite 
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:23:32
I will agree they need to pay their fair share. Still not agreeing we should give people money for nothing though

Jeff bezos took a huge risk and it paid off. I don’t think you understand what entrepreneurship is.
Are you simple or intentionally and maliciously stupid? 
@_date: 2019-03-17 02:17:47
That sounds way too much like the China good credit system for being a good commie in China. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 02:21:53

@_date: 2019-03-17 03:18:08
On the real though if 18 yr old me knew I was getting 1k a month I would never done a damn thing with my life

Been chatting with my friend about this and we came up with this:
Legislate a maximum threshold for automation. As in you can only automate to a certain point and after that you’re required to have a work force.
It’s not very capitalist of me but I can’t think of any other way.
