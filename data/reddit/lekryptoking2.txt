I think $1M is a sure bet at this point.

Yeah a country banning cryptos is totally gonna make a difference LOL. People are definitely going to say "well, my government doesnt want me to have bitcoins, so i wont have some."

I've traded 10,000+ BTC in my life and I never had to upload ID or any shit like that.

Bitcoin is NOT a payment solution. Never has been, never will be. It's a money storage and transfer solution. You want a payment solution, get lightning.

10000% agreed with this

There are actually QUADRILLION of dollars in derivative product. Mortgages, options, etc.

Why exactly? Why can't we do without credit? If you want something, save and wait until you have enough.

BATCHED 
Stop misinformation please.

Cash, in person.


You mean like what Hillary Clinton did? Looks like it worked pretty well for her.


You could still trade it to other people for goods. Barter.

The scam democrats use to destroy America? Yes, I've heard of it - from the same man who really introduced it to the world, Al Gore, and who now makes millions every year from it.
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:58:35
Ah yes, hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees to comply with vague regulations with 0 guarantee you will be fine afterwards. Brilliant idea
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:27:03
You mispelled "in"

It's time to get rid of banks altogether. They have no reason to exist anymore. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:55:45


Yeah that's not gonna happen
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:58:51
Bitcoin cannot be regulated and taxed lol. Go read a bit on it before you make comments like that.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:57:01


Fuck yes I am

@_date: 2018-02-15 14:35:53
I'd just delete my private key and laugh.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:53:20
Can we stop talking about BCH please? Let's just ignore this garbage BS scam and move on. Thanks.

@_date: 2018-02-10 23:03:12
Why not?
This is a shit I don't understand, why do people send their ID to exchanges to trade bitcoins? I've never done that, never will. It goes against everything bitcoins are.
ID to buy bitcoins with fiat, maybe ok. To trade? Fuck no.
