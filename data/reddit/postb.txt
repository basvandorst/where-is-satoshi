To people saying this is an invalid approach, you may be surprised to here that calculating the daily returns likelihood is actually one of the most widely used and accepted measures of securities risk. So much so that portfolios are generally constructed to include a balance of securities with different daily return distributions. Whilst yes there are refinements that can be made, such as normalised returns, trend  and momentum analysis or inflationary adjustments, these do not drastically change the basic result. Extending daily returns using Monte Carlo is a sensible approach to project a random processes - which one could argue is applicable in the case of medium to long term returns for securities.  
Nice job

What Is gold but a limited supply metal. People used to use cocoa beans. 
The basis of any currency is really in its difficulty to be easily copied and its commodity value. Bitcoin, the Blockchain, is virtually tamper proof and this is also the foundation of its value.

Regulations are mainly aimed at money laundering. And we should be / are in favour of this. Regulation is not a bad thing, it legitimises. 
Purchases are already regulated to a large degree, daily limits, identification requirements etc.

It’s due to levels of demand. Try other wallets.

With pros come cons. Sadly the introduction of futures will make bitcoin a playground for market manipulators, if you’ve ever invested in the ftse AIM you’ll know what I’m talking about. Especially as a large majority of btc buyers are non-investors typically - holders hold!  On the plus side futures add significant liquidity to markets.

Have a search. Cex.io or bread.app are ones I’ve had luck with.

Yes. You have to think in percentage terms. For 2017 the daily price changes have been in the range of +- 3 to 25%. So 4-6k per day is no problem when 1 btc = 40k. This is why it’s so attractive to day traders, big swings, lots of trading opportunity.

I’d take half (or your initial investment) and place that into an alternative currency / split of securities. Not a dig against bitcoin, it’s just that a portfolio of that size should have at least some diversity

Potentially yes - a bot or trading algorithm that focuses on one asset class, crypto currency in this case, may be engineered to make trades based on some historical correlation between different currencies.

It depends on your rationale for selling/ hodling. Yes by selling now you realise losses. But, if you think the price is going to drop lower than present levels then selling now will allow you to buy back more at a lower price (depending on your entry price)- attaining more btc in the long run. You need to calculate your position based on your entry points. I stagger bought from 5-12k (£) and have sold 50% over the past few days as I see the current news/sentiment is driving this lower -  but my plan is to buy more when the price stabilises. Of course this is only a plan
