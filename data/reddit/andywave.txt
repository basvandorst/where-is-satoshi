I'm trying Bitcoin Core part of your guide. I do have swap file allowed on external disk. 
During sync phase i have 900MB+ RAM and 500MB swap used. Is it really possible to sync withound swap?

Why there are no Russian or Chinese testnet nodes?

This guide is for Bitcoin core on *testnet* and Eclair Lightning node. Bitcoin core is very simple to switch to mainet (comment/delete in config testnet=1 and open port 8333 in FW)
Dont know about Eclair.

On desktop you can run bitcoin-qt executable with -testnet parameter:
    bitcoin-qt -testnet

With enabled SSH on Pi. On Windows PC  you can use [WinSCP]( to move files.
Testnet directoy is in [testnet3 folder](
You need to [copy]( blocks subdirectory and chainstate subdirectory.

How to batch or which wallets support batching?

Thank you very much. Other RasPi bitcoin node guides compile and compilation takes 2 hours.
I recommend downloading blocks and chainstate directories on desktop and transfer it to Pi to save sync time.
I’m running c-lightning from this guide 
Advantage of c-lightning is, that is not requiring txindex=1 in conf file (indexing takes lot of time)

Is there segwit vanity address generator?

I believe that all lightning implementations require communication with full node. Testnet has no more than 15GB at this moment.

It updated automatically on android. They could warn about losing old data folder. I could send testBTC to some faucet...

I'm bootstrapping blockchain for 8 days on RasPi. 86% and last percents will take longer.
Better idea is to download blockchain on PC a move Data folder.
