Anyone knows that very old video (maybe 2013) where a black guy was shouting at a webcam "bitcoooooin? You said bitcoooooin!". I cannot find it anywhere

Thanks for the reply, but I still think your story is quite weird.
796 indeed has futures. I do not have data, but I still think they did not have enough liquidity to provide for leveraging 20X 72K $, which becomes the huge amount of 1.4M $, or 3500BTC (at 400$ each). 
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:45:20
In November 2014 there were not platforms providing Futures with 20X leverage and the currents ones do not provide enough liquidity for trading with 120 BTC... this post looks like a fake.
Can you provide some other information for double checking what you are saying?

I am resident in Finland where bitcoin's profit are taxed. Are profits counted and losses not counted? I make an example: I buy on an exchange website a bitcoin at 50$, I sell it at 300$, I buy it again at 300$ and then I sell it at 50$. Should I be taxed as having an income of 250$? (and real income of zero)

Up to now there are strong proves that the website is legit and the manager (dooglus) very good. In any case any website taking your bitcoins (or your money) can be a scam and it would be useful to find working measure to understand that. (Whereas your points 1,2,3,4 do not hint much :-P)

It's a biased article I guess?
“no one really has a good theory of the price of gold. It’s a puzzle. And so I believe it’s a sign of how desperate the bitcoiners have become that the only argument for bitcoin as a serious store of value is by analogy to something whose value we don’t understand its value!”

You are missing that bitcoins are not made for destroying banks and their different kinds of business that, as you say, will go on normally. However it is possible that the market will change a bit since bitcoins are so cheap to move and deal with.

[EDITED] Maybe you refer to the date at the end of the bank's employers signatures, it looks like it is the date of the bank of China's document. On BTCChina the translation is dated 5 december (the date of the document in chinese), but apparently wasn't' visible on the home until few minutes ago.

Same happens to me, even though I told them who I am but I do not remember what name I put at first account creation  (a random name probably). The frustrating part is that they accept deposit even though you are not verified, but not withdrawals.
