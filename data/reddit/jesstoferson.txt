That’s the basic principle, yes.

Bitcoin emoji? ��️?

I agree, an emoji would be easy to implement, and the iPhone keyboard can pick up on words that are associated with emojis, so it could maybe see that you typed Bitcoin, and auto correct it to a real Bitcoin symbol. AN EVEN BETTER INVASION!

I had no idea, I thought Emoji was the standard, like it was some standard programming language or something that would allow any device to interpret it. TIL

Why tho? ��
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:43:24
I meant why would each company interpret it differently.? Comic Sans is Comic Sans on any computer isn’t it?

Well hopefully if someone designed a dedicated Bitcoin Emoji, the color or shape may change,  but hopefully the symbol inside would stay the same.

But not everyone has a wallet. I’m just thinking a little obscure Bitcoin monetary marker, like ¥,£,€, or $. It’s on the third page of symbols (i.e. you have to hit the numbers button, then the alternative symbols button to get to the page with €£¥). So it’d be so out of they way people May not see it, but it’d be there, waiting for when you accidentally shuffle to that “alternative symbols” page.

Can you use a VPN or TOR to access exchanges in other countries? Or can you access them anyways? I heard mention that Korean markets work at more premium prices. E.g. buy on gdax, sell on Korean for profit? Is there a time delay? Or can you just buy at $11,000 and go to the other exchange and sell for 12,000 “Korean dollars” (forgive my ignorance of their money’s name)?

came to r/bitcoin to post this, particularly for the segment at [6:04]( and onwards. The 6 minutes before that are interesting, but it struck a cord when the investors are saying that Amazon's growth isn't "rational". 1000% in a year; 1999, what a time to be alive...
