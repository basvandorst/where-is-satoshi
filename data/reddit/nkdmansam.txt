fodder for buttcoin

I still think Bitcoin is too volatile and risky to be considered a safe-haven asset.

I'm getting the broadcast, no problem.  I would say the presentation has been positive overall.  Much better than what I was expecting after Lawsky's first proposal.  It sounds like they have listened sincerely to the comments/feedback provided by the community and incorporated it, to some extent, in their revisions.

I did say "it sounds like."  The proof will be in the pudding.  His comments seemed like responses to the some of the top rated comments when the first version was posted here.  To me, it sounds like he is listening.

Hi Ben, 
This proposal sucks! 
Everyone who is not NYDFS

actually because money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions violations, drug trafficking proceeds, tax evasion...

There are also strict KYC requirements that I am sure he did not abide by.

THIS! It's called a SAR

or like taking gold and putting it in a vault... which some people do.

consensus would probably not favor a drastic price crash, which is exactly what would happen if the 21 million got fucked.

I'll get the papers get the papers

buttcoin is just as much a circle jerk these days. Maybe even worse.

[what could have been...](
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:27:41
high honors from the butthurt of buttcoin.  That sub inherited a lot of r/bitcoin circlejerkers, they're just buttguys now.  Both subs would be better off without them.
