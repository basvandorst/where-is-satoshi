Coinbase does take out 2 small payments to verify the account, but a lot of banks do block crypto purchases and label them as scams and fraudulent. Coinbase gets a lot of flack, but I've never had a problem.

Now  see, this is a good reply. I like what you have to say, but I guess we will just have to agree that we will never actually agree on this. Genuinely, best of luck on your investment and your cultural revolution.

I don't currently own Bitcoin myself, but did in the past. I think your right in part on the missing the boat concept, Bitcoin goes to $20k somebody 4x their money,  but if they get lucky on top 20 coin XYZ or ABC they may 100x or even 1000x... but I also think there really is some of the "its old" coming into play. Why keep buying into the Playstation when the PS4 is out. Look at some of these projects and see some amazing work coming out of them.  Yeah you could make the arguement that it is a store of value, but so is the US dollar, the Euro, the whatever countries. If I want to store value,  do I want my money in something that is for the most part "stable" or something that has just as much chance to 2x as it does loose 50% of it's value over night?

So your saying a 10 year old computer isn't old when compared to modern systems? Technology cant be thought of in the same age brackets as what we are used to. I do like the idea of locals and tourist, good way of putting it, maybe I'm a local with the projects I care about and a tourist with those I don't? I do see the value of blockchain and cryptography in general, I'm just not convinced that bitcoin will stay the king. The FBI are getting pretty good at monitoring addresses btw, but yeah I agree it is deflationary. Censorship and confiscation, ah maybe. Give the governments time and we can see. As far as being decentralized, that is what basically all of them are working toward even if they aren't there yet. I think 75% are worthless garbage and will go away in time, I don't think bitcoin is one of them, and it will always be around.

To me that is where you get into speculative investment versus a "savings account. " money that I'm looking to be safe with is in 401k, bonds,  etc... to me crypto is high risk,  high reward, not just a place to park money.  I'm not here trying to push other coins,  but seriously,  if you look at what some are doing,  they are just starting to show their real world use case.  Over used example,  but I like to look at it like seeing Amazon 20 years ago and saying,  that weird little online book store is a great idea. I don't put money into a coin unless I plan to hold it for years, research the project and team and keep up with all their news online.

Honestly, I've already replied more on this thread than I generally do,  so I'm done after this no matter the reply.  As I've said to some of the others,  your not going to change my mind,  I'm not going to change yours,  so goodluck in your bitcoin is king mantra, I hope it works out for you.  I've already said I'm not here to push specific coins or projects,  but I was at a blockchain conference in Minneapolis about 2 weeks ago where the speaker was the VP of Thomson Reuters. He said that they believe all real estate transactions,  title changes,  property tax records etc will be kept on the blockchain. They don't have a crypto themselves but have been  speaking to multiple parties about partnerships.  The room was filled with crypto fan boys, real estate professionals,  government officials, certified appraisers... and I'd say even though the reception to the idea was positive,  the perception of bitcoin was so overwhelmingly negative that the speaker made it a point to distance it and himself from bitcoin.

This is how I remember it.. got my account locked for no reason, no response from support for over a month. Finally one day my account just unlocked, still no reply from support.

Oh I understand perfectly what it's about, I'm saying in the time they have been working on it, it's still an absolutely flawed project that is going to get lapped by 3rd gen cryptos. And any bitcoin maximalist that cant see how bitcoin isn't going to solve every problem are extremely short sighted. Plenty of new developers are achieving things that bitcoin never will. Btw everybody feel free to continue to downvote... just shows how even though I've said multiple times I believe in Bitcoin as a project and that it will continue to be around... you cant even take the slightest hint of a negative comment.

I would argue that it is only slightly mainstream,  "bitcoin, yeah I've heard of that. It has something to do with illegal activities and the interwebs right?" I would say that I wouldn't say bitcoin has officially been deemed "gold" yet. Not saying it won't, just saying that simply because its first doesn't make it the best. Plenty of companies out there that did things first that got rolled over by Walmart.

Yep, I was about to type the same thing... stop getting all your news and perspective from random people on Reddit. Pay attention to what the developers are actually doing, look at the growth, the partnerships etc...
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:45:01
I agree with most of what your saying. I never stress out about the market, if it crashes and I loose it all meh, I'm considering everything I have invested as house money and not worrying about it. I will say that I think 95% of cryptos will die out,  but several will have actual use case and stick around. The fun part is figuring out which those are. If someone wants to hold btc and dump everything else so be it... but that's no fun.
@_date: 2018-11-02 01:51:14
I do both.  Most of my money goes into stable accounts like 401k, stocks etc... I just buy into crypto because of that potential 100x profit. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:41:57
Exactly, anybody that takes investment advice from people on reddit are going to have a bad time... whelp, off to buy the dip.
