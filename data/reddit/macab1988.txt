Research stop loss and buy limit ~~my friend~~. No reason to hate.
Edit. Saw your username and comment history. Explains a lot.

I already sold on Friday. No reason to stay in when it falls. Buy in is always possible.

Not talking about losses or wins anymore, I'm doing fine. Just want to leave a comment that you must be a disgusting human being, offending others online and being homophobe and racist. I can only imagine what a useless, sad person you must be. I truly feel sorry for the people that have to deal with you in real life.

I know there's many charities, but please spend something on our planet! Education, cures of illnesses, technology, etc. is worth nothing if we can't save our nature and free living animals.
WWF was always my place to spend.

Never saw something that is so sad as you. I am sorry for all the good Americans out there who are being laughed at and disrespected because of such pitifully, stupid human beings like you.
Now go back in your shelter being scared of muslims and the free world.
Btw. my country is no member of Nato and the language is German you uneducated idiot.

I think my opinion is in a minority here as everybody tries to convince others to hold.

I did not state anything about where the bitcoin is in a year.

I made 35% out of what I invested. Visible in numbers. No language skills needed. I'm out.

To all the people who cry for hodl. We have here an intact downward trend which end is not in sight yet. For people who bought by begin of last week, it is time to go out now and take the win as long as there is some left. Everything else is just irrational.

You're still in the win zone, time to realize it, you can still buy in again. Could be that next week will be a rally again. My guess is to rebuy at between 11500-12500.
