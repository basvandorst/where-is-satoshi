My best guess is that mining currently isn't very profitable because of hobbyists that want to support the network with lower tx fees and are willing to mine at a small loss.  However, selling mining equipment still can be profitable.  They can also insulate themselves from risk by selling at a set price instead of mining with an uncertain difficulty.

"Can't" is probably invalid to say in a 'never say never' way, but "probably won't" is accurate.  There are measure in place to self regulate, such as the community awareness we've seen today.  The most powerful motivating factor is that the amount of money required to gain 51% of the power means you've invested heavily in bitcoin and probably have an interest in its success and avoiding these problems.

Why is bitcoin transaction rate so much more limited than credit cards?  I recall it being something like 7/second vs. thousands/second.  I know they have a shitload of datacenters, but don't the bitcoin miners and QT users compare better than 0.1% of their speed?

Bitcoin functions based on a public ledger (the blockchain).  Making sure our blockchains match enables anonymous parties to have a sort of trust.  I haven't heard of a cryptocurrency abandoning the idea of a blockchain, but you can seek to hid who owns the addresses it describes.  
I personally think anonymity at this stage would mostly hurt the adoption rate of bitcoin.  Once bitcoin is more widespread and accepted, it's an easy hop to another currency or code update for people who really do want to be anonymous.

Using the Dwolla method, it's ~3 business days to verify your account, ~4 business days for a transfer to clear into Dwolla, then up to 6 hours to transfer to CampBX.  
I can't speak for the other methods and those times are to the best I can remember.  Most of this is a one time burden, but it is an issue if you need bitcoins immediately.  However, I see this as a silver lining because I would recommend taking your time to start out on bitcoin before jumping in with both feet and cash in hand.

This conversation makes no sense in the first place, so why not further down the rabbit hole?

How can bitcoin compete as a point of sale method?  It currently seems very clunky for them to pull out a tablet, have you pull out the phone and app, type in all the numbers (who wants to type 8 decimals?), and then wait for confirmation.

There is a commonly understood problem of the exponential growth of the blockchain.  People have suggested that hard drive size and internet speed would keep up with the growth, but we can already see that failing.  There has also been the suggestion that a few services would handle that part of the process for us, like electrum does.  However, that seems to move toward centralizing bitcoin.
Could we not just hash everything older than a certain point, or is that information needed for bitcoin client operation?  If it is not needed for everyday use, why could we not just trust the hash to match other nodes as we do with all blocks in the chain?
