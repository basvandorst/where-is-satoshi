Got any links? You've got me all curious.
@_date: 2013-06-25 21:31:41
You make some interesting points, I had considered averaging in but there is much to consider as you clearly point out. Thank you for your in depth thoughts I'll be referring to them often :)
@_date: 2013-06-24 22:26:29
Yes, you don't show up at all. Haha.
EDIT: Just not looking for a western style shootout over bitcoins, not worth it.

Everything from account creation to this comment has been done through TOR and pay.reddit.com
Of course hypothetically I may just have a teleporter. At least that's what the IP log for my account would suggest.
Thanks for watching my back though homeboy!

Buying/Selling via MtGox isn't the same as doing a private transaction in terms of the emotional ripple effect for people.
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:17:18
Recently? Or was this back in the "good ol days" ?
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:21:44
I don't need the price to drop I'm fine buying at the current price. Your sarcasm list isn't very helpful which would be okay if it was funny but sadly it's neither :(
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:01:55
What's your reasoning behind the coinsetter suggestion if I may ask?
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:56:11
Omg you got me I am prism nsa lulz 1337.
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:04:57
Enough to get robbed.
@_date: 2013-06-24 22:32:45
I wish I was a bank/government. I would print useless paper and buy up every last bicoin on the market with it for as long as I could, non stop.
I don't think this is a "wealth of investigative material for them" though. Worst case scenario they find out about the few guys who hit me up via PM and buy some bitcoins from them.
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:12:40
They look interesting but their volume is a bit too low for such a purchase it looks like, unless I am mistaken?
@_date: 2013-06-25 02:51:38
Fair point but not worried about Chinese kids.
*cue breaking bad I AM THE DANGER speech*
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:23:56
A million USD is cool but a bajillion BTC is ice cold. Feel me brother?
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:56:22
Ain't nobody got time fo dat.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:01:35
Okay, thank you!
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:26:49
I can only provide hypothetical answers for this hypothetical situation so you'll probably leave here disappointed.
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:36:57
Actually considered this, going to keep the idea in the back of my head. Thank you!
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:55:44
Always interested in seeing what the fine folk on reddit say in addition to the advice of financial people I hypothetically employ.
@_date: 2013-06-25 01:22:49
I'll keep this in mind, thank you!
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:02:20
I didn't know that being curious about methods of purchasing something was a way to gain net cred on a throwaway account, gee thanks! TIL!
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:04:04
I don't take anyone who says "urself" seriously anyway.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:56:34
If this made any sense at all rest assured I would do it.
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:03:36
I suppose MtGox may be an option, didn't someone buy 15,000 BTC through them recently?
@_date: 2013-06-25 01:44:49
YES, LET US BUY THIS PRIVATELY OFF THE MAIN EXCHANGES. EGHEMMMMM
Oh my gosh I am so excited let me know when you feel it working :D tee hee
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:03:19
Not a bad guess
@_date: 2013-06-24 23:09:48
Buying that much BTC publicly won't damage the price as much as selling it I imagine. Probably would boost it if anything. Whether that would trigger some people to sell or not, that's another story.
@_date: 2013-06-25 01:35:48
Brother Najizaboul! Where do you think I got this money from in the first place?! Hit up uncle Halabdolakafatkaiz and he will help you out immediately.
@_date: 2013-06-25 01:27:48
Ehh on going to the event, that would require meeting with people in person and with all the scary things out there in the world like aids and Japanese merchandise I'd like to avoid going outside.
Will log you down and hypothetically PM you later though, thank you for offering!
EDIT: On second thought maybe I'll go just for fun, it's invitation only and that really caters to my ego. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:18:21
@_date: 2013-06-25 21:30:27
I'll tell you whatever you want to hear baby.
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:47:06
Oooh this looks neat, thank you!
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:02:09
That seems much harder than doing a wire transfer.
@_date: 2013-06-25 06:05:32
Teach me to be a better poker player and maybe I will, hypothetically. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:52:14
That would remove a lot of anonymity from the transaction unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-06-24 22:27:51
Instructions were unclear, fan stuck in dick.
@_date: 2013-08-06 20:03:36
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:58:13
You're right about diversifying but I don't want to buy units that represent bitcoins I want straight up bitcoins to do what I please with them. Competence with wallets and such is far from being an issue.
Any link/source I could check out on them selling bitcoins directly?
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:15:37
Trade hill look interesting but their volume is a bit too low for such a purchase it looks like, unless I am mistaken? Will have to find out more about Coinlab, thank you.
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:48:23
Fund, not actual bitcoins purchased.
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:55:52
If there are any here feel free to PM me but I don't feel like (hypothetically of course) meeting up with someone in-person to write them money and I'm sure as hell not bringing a million in cash.
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:47:32
Great point just noticed that, will get in touch with both of them!
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:17:26
@_date: 2013-06-25 01:43:27
I don't expect to do anything, this is all hypothetical, remember?
Completely unrelated, thought it would be fun to share this with you. Totally unrelated though. Not related at all. Nope.
@_date: 2013-06-24 23:12:14
Omg u $r so $helpful
@_date: 2013-06-24 17:16:02
What is this OTC you speak of?
@_date: 2013-06-25 01:46:48
Reddit throwaway usernames, srs bidness.
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:06:07
That's what I was thinking
@_date: 2013-06-24 16:59:05
They offer a bitcoin fund as far as I can tell, not direct purchase of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-25 01:56:11
Screw those guys. Not gonna do no bidness with the regulation bros.
@_date: 2013-08-05 08:31:21
Send me a private message please, I can't initiate one for some reason.
