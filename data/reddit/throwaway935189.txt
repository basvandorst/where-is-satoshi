Yes, I went out of my way to explain everything to the teller, because I know AML screening when I see it.  You don't have to explain anything, but I figured it would help.  I think that once they finish their investigation, everything should be good.   It just may take a few days, because it has escalated internally from a computer algorithm that flagged the transactions (large influx of many small cash deposits to a specific account/customer), to a low level employee (pair of human eyes) that doesn't have a clue and only passes it up the chain to an experienced AML analyst.  At this level it should clear after a bit of research.

I think $500 is the max.  The error handling message doesn't make this clear, but what it is really trying to say is that your amount $X is too much.

it is better to move to an offline/private wallet ... online wallet is risky

I think it is something like this.  Transaction fee may be 0.0005, and if you have 1 BTC, you need to send .9995.  If you try to send 1.0000 it will give you that error (that you don't have enough to cover the fee)

I suspect that BoA is doing internal investigations on AML.   The whole financial industry is paranoid right now ... not related to BTC, but AML in general due to government crackdown.   Last BoA cash deposit I did to LocalTill , the teller asked a lot of questions.   They may have flagged LocalTill's account.  Considering the amount of cash transfers into their account recently, it is not surprising.  I think that it should clear eventually, for reasons that I will not get into.
