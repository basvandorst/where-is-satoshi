This is actually great advice. Anyone who disagrees is wrong. It's been proven time and time again. If you hodl long enough then Bitcoin is one of the best investments you can make.

Because Bitmain only makes money from SHA256 hashing

And he's comparing all that to crypto currency as a whole.
He doesn't understand or value any of the technological benefits provided by crypto which is very naive.

This is awesome! I've been thinking of a similar concept for a few months. Are you involved with the project?

I think he's saying that large amounts are being removed from the normal trading "supply". I can't verify if the statement is true but I've been hearing that this rally is being driven by institutional money so it makes sense they would be transferring large amounts off exchanges into more secure custodial or cold wallets.
Just wait until the halvening squeezes supply even more...

Where does the Bible say Jesus asks Judas to betray him? My understanding is that he tells everyone he knows that one of them will betray him. And that Judas chose to sell him out is why he goes crazy and sees demons everywhere.

Not necessarily because there is an added cost of maintaining a larger roadway. Optimization is making the cars smaller or cramming more payload inside each one without modifying the highway.

Oh really? You were there?

So basically all their fancy math still doesn't mean shit?
Technical analysis (especially with something as volatile as Bitcoin) is pure BS!

He was right about one thing but he's wrong about many others, especially when it comes to Bitcoin.

Because we know that if/when you do sell, you may not get the timing right to get back in and in the process of selling you just decreased your BTC holdings.
The long game is acquiring as much BTC as possible and panic selling is an avoidable risk.

That's like asking why Auto manufacturers don't just run transportation services as well. It's not their business model.

Obviously you haven't been in the Bitcoin game very long or you would see this as par for the course. Crazy volatility can happen at anytime (and usually because of China).
I've been in Bitcoin since 2013 and I've experienced way worse than this. I've gotten lucky and burned trading on the news and have learned the best strategy is to just sit tight and hodl.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:40:27
That explanation is precisely what is going on!

"Proper trading methodology outperforms hodling"
Guessing correctly outperforms doing nothing but guessing incorrectly does not.

You could do recurring payments with a wallet that was designed to do such a thing but technically it isn't a necessary feature of the Bitcoin protocol. And I even agree that it's better that it isn't possible or else it could be another attack vector.

Nobody makes money consistently by guessing what might happen. They do it by weilding influence on the market through big moves and disinformation.

How anyone could think that guy is Satoshi is an insult to Satoshi's genius.
@_date: 2017-07-11 11:44:06
My thoughts exactly. I expected the opposite to happen with people fearing HF to ditch Bitcoin for other cryptos.
Just goes to show you can never predict how this beast behaves.

Is his name really Ken Hodler? That's such a fitting name.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:24:00
So maybe it should be renamed Bcrash

Tell that to The DAO backers.

If all you care about is the value relative to fiat then yes, it does matter. But if your goal is to accumulate and hodl Bitcoin then as long as you didn't sell anything, your hodlings remain unchanged.
Once you start thinking in terms of BTC then the fluctuating conversion rates are just noise.

Nick Szabo is against big blocks and Gavin Andresen thinks Craig Wright is Satoshi. Nuff said.
@_date: 2017-07-11 11:47:31
The same could be said for Ethereum and all the eth based ICOs but it's still tanking.
I think there is an overall bearishness at the moment but Bitcoin maintains a stronger base of support in times of uncertainty.

Andreas is the man!

The short answer is because miners need to sell the coins they mine to cover operating expenses.
The type of person that would benefit from such a strategy you suggest is someone who A. Has enough BTC in possession that they could short a large amount and B. Also has enough reserve cash to buy back at the lower rate.
You're describing a scenario that probably has happened a lot, especially when Bitcoin was smaller and easier to game but I don't think miners had anything to do with it, necessarily.
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:13:04
So you think a coin created by a mining cartel to protect their secret technical advantage is more in line with Satoshi's vision?

JavaScript is probably the best language to focus on.
There are just libraries like bcoin that let you run a full Bitcoin node in NodeJS and the browser. Also Solidity, the language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum, is derived from JavaScript so very similar syntax.

I've been in the Bitcoin game since 2013. I've seen much volatility and even tried to game it myself. Trust me that the best strategy is to buy and keep buying (double down on the dips if you can) but never sell. If you play the game long enough you will outperform 99.9% of all traders.
