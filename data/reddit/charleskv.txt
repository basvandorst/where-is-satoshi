Firstly, everyone is right telling you to get your coins out of the exchange. 
Exchanges are vulnerable to hacking, as it already occurred a couple of times in the past. It would be a pity to loose your coins.
To store your coins there are different ways, each of them being more or less secure. The one that I’ll explain you about are: 
- Hot wallets
- Hardware wallets
- Cold storage
Hot wallets:
These are free of charge, you can download it directly from your AppStore/Android Market. (Eg: Mycelium, Bitcoin wallet,  bread, Xapo etc etc)
When downloaded, just follow the instructions.
This is the easiest way to store your coins but it is potentially vulnerable because it is connected to the internet.
Hardware wallets:
You will have to order it form internet. It is presented under the form of a device that you can connect by usb to your computer.
It is way safer than a hot wallet, in order to steal your bitcoin somebody will have to hack your device. So have it physically...
Concerning a potential destruction of your wallet. Doesn’t matter. You will have to write down a series of words. This is your backup sentence. KEEP IT SAFE AS JEWELRY !
Make copy of it if you are scared of a house fire. Keep the copie in a safe, at your mums place or whatever, but remember that this is what will give you access to your coins in the case of the disparition of your hardware wallet.
 Cold storage:
A way of storing your bitcoin that leaves it totally out of the internet.
It is impossible to lose your bitcoin unless you lose its QR.
I hope that this brief explanation can help you to keep your coins safe.
