If they don't know they can buy a fraction, they they don't understand how it can be spent. If they don't understand how bitcoin can be spent, then they shouldn't be investing in it.

If you can think of a better way to cheaply store large volumes of data that need to last many years and need infrequent access, I'd like to hear it.
Tapes are still the best option for enterprise archiving.

Just think of all the bad things Paypal does, and then imagine that you had no alternative, and couldn't opt out.
* Paypal froze the account of an ordinary, legal cloud storage site, because they refused to give paypal a backdoor into every user's files. ([source](
* Paypal froze the account of Wikileaks, blocking their donations, even though it is a legal charity, (generally) operating in the public's interest ([source](
* Paypal often blocks the accounts of sex workers, or anything remotely related to the sex industry. Even though it's perfectly legal. The effect is that people's livelihoods are destroyed ([source](
* Paypal often blocks transactions where the description includes the word "cuba" or "syria". (i.e. just the names of countries). When this happens, they lack transperancy, take a long time to respond to quieries, and generally hinder commerce [(cuba source)]( ([syria source](
In a cashless society, there would be no escaping these issues. Banks would start forcing their cautionary idea of ethics onto everyone, thereby crippling perfectly legal businesses.

You can't compare the prices of things with different units unless you make arbitrary conversion ratios.
E.g. 1 BTC = 1 once of gold
1 tube of toothpaste = 5kWh of electricity
Both comparisons are equally useless and meaningless.

Serious question: how does crypto shorting work? Who is on the other side of the transaction?
If you want to go long on Bitcoin, just buy bitcoin. Why would anyone buy a long CFD for bitcoin?

How many people here have tried actually parsing the blockchain directly? 
I tried for hours,  but couldn't.  The popular python SDKs don't work. And it's pretty impossible to write your own because there is no comprehensive documentation for all versions of block formats.
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:30:20
Yes.  What I am saying is that I tried.  I wrote my own parser to read the variable length ints and so on. I wrote my own code to read those ones and zeros   at the sub-byte level. So i did learn how it works.  But the structure of the headers has changed over time.  So I could parse some blocks but not others.
@_date: 2019-02-28 03:47:56
It looks like [some people are serious](
@_date: 2019-06-12 06:09:43
That's the first step. Thankfully it is easy. So you have a copy of the blockchain. But can you read it?
 If I gave you a wallet address, could you give me a list of transactions to and from that address?
If I asked you what the total transaction volume was on a particular day last month, could you tell me?
If I asked you what fraction of wallets have received transactions and sent nothing in the last 50 days, would you be able to tell me?
@_date: 2019-02-15 02:19:56


The Bitcoin blockchain is about 300GB last time I checked. You cannot search through a 300GB linked list "instantly".
If they're handling 6 terradollars worth of transactions per day, they'll probably end up with an even larger blockchain.

The US government holds a huge amount of Bitcoin from seizures in criminal cases. IIRC they had to be careful when they started selling it, because selling that much volume all at once at market price would tank the price.
@_date: 2019-01-11 01:57:21
Nah. Any programmer will tell you that you can have an array or list of length 1, or even length 0. A blockchain is no different.

If you shop around for the cheapest region, you might make it 20% cheaper.
There might be a way to use something other than EBS, but even Amazon's cheapest storage service (S3, not useable as a computer hard drive) is 50% of that cost.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:50:04
Sorry, too many acronyms.
[EC2 is Amazon's virtual machine (VM) offering]( Amazon is likely the cheapest virtual machine provider.
The default hard drive for their virtual machines is called [EBS]( 
So to run a bitcoin node in the cloud, you'll pay:
* The virtual machine (t2.small) cost of [0.0292 USD per hour]( = 255.8 USD per year
* The hard drive for that virtual machine to store the 300GB blockchain, at a cost of [0.1 USD /GB /month]( = 360 USD / year
Total 615 USD/year

Isn't much cost? How much do you think a 300GB hard drive costs? Or a ~~300GB EBS volume for an EC2 VM.~~ virtual machine in the cloud with a 300GB hard drive.

The price would matter only because it impacts transaction costs.
To get reasonably low transaction costs, we'd have have a price much lower than the current price. (There are other factors too, but transaction fees are proportional to price).

I suspect this is like how Uber price hikes are 2.1×, not 2.0×.
It's just a psychological trick to make users accept it. A less round number sounds like it was decided upon using data and a formula, instead of a finger in the wind.

IIRC the last transaction I did was $10 and I paid over $0.5 in fees. I.e. over 5%. That was allegedly a 'low' fee, but any normal person would consider that high.

I understand that the mining fee is independent of the size of the transaction (since hashing a small number takes as much effort as a larger number.)
But from a consumer perspective, saying a fee is high or low *only* makes sense relative to the transaction size.
A $100 fee for a $1M payment is low. A $0.5 fee for a $10 payment is high. 
In this partocular case I was transferring from one of my devices to another, so I would have been happier paying 5c even if it meant waiting 1 week.
@_date: 2017-05-04 09:22:52
I'm not a fan of airbitz. The transaction fees are fixed to a really high amount. You can't customize it. (E.g. low fee for when the transaction is not urgent)
