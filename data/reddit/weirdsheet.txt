Hey, how do we REALLY know if Satoshi committed suicide or not? So let's not presume that this tweet is wrong.
We should ask Newsweek... I'm SURE they would know if he did kill himself.

Next day, I helped a friend download a wallet and gave her the bits Roger gave me.
Passing it forward... :)

He's right. If the govt says "no more bitcoin" everyone will stop using it.
Like how when the govt said "no more alcohol" (The Prohibition) everyone stopped drinking.
And that's why there is no alcohol anymore...
