But most people, the 99% don't engage in everyday illegal activity. With that said, thouth McAfee only predicts up to 2020, quantum computing technology will render Bitcoin useless in a couple of years. Quantum blockchain is what you're after, and Bitcoin can't compete against that.

He just seems so narrow minded about it like there is absolutely no way it can fail. Regulating something like this isn't easy, but it sure isn't impossible. His argument of advertising on the dark web feels far fetched, your average mom and pop shop won't advertise on the dark web and the average Joe won't go looking for it there.

Ah thank you. Understood. Always looking to learn more. Im more of an enthusiast on the subject, than someone that knows all the ins and outs. Just a college student trying to keep up with the jext big thing :)

If I may ask, how would that actually be done or be possible?

I mean, transaction signatures are exactly what it'll affect the most. As soon as quantum computers are able to calculate the private keys through brute force, people will lose faith in Bitcoin. Don't get me wrong, I love blockchain and the potential it has for the future. IOTA, for example, is supposedly quantum proof, but I'm not actively supporting that either. We're heading for a new stage in technological development where binary computers will be outdated.
