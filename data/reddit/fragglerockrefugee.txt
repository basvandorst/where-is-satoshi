I'm just pointing out that I used a more expensive service because I needed quicker confirmations(3) in a short period of time and Coinbase has been pretty reliable for this.  I don't always need it to be fast so I use what works for the occasion.  If I had sent using my own wallet and a lower fee, that first confirmation could have taken all day and sometimes I am alright with that.

People will use LN because it settles on a secure network like Bitcoin.  If the Bitcoin network were to become insecure then people wouldn't trust LN that runs on top of it.  The incentive is there to keep Bitcoin decentralized and secure so that centralized and decentralized layers will want to use it.  Otherwise we would just use traditional banking.

That's not really what we are asking.  We are asking them to look at the account to see if it has been compromised or violated their ToS.  It has suddenly started promoting Ver's empire so that's pretty concerning.  And is circumstantial evidence that the account has possibly been bought or hacked.  If Ver wants to use twitter to attack us, we can certainly ask twitter to take a look.

Big cities in Canada have had a real estate boom in recent years from international investors.  I imagine that accepting a global currency with low friction will make it easier for those international investors to pay their taxes.

I think that when the price is dumping, traders are looking for a safe place to put their money.  A crypto that pegs itself to the USD is very attractive for them so they can avoid the sharks(whales).
  
The recent downswing helps satisfy the demand and need for printing but they still aren't transparent enough for my liking.

The centralization FUD around LN is the easiest to pick apart since it really doesn't matter as long as Bitcoin remains decentralized.  The fact is that as Bitcoin becomes more and more the standard because of its high security through PoW, there will be services that are centralized built on top of it.  This is desirable.  We want everyone on board and that means many use cases.

Any gap right now will be filled so there is no incentive to create those gaps right now unless it is in the pursuit of long term solutions.  batching is not a long term solution and will not lower fees even in the short term.  Coinbase needs to focus on segwit + LN since 2nd layer is the real long term scaling solution.  The current block pressure is good and incentivizes the development of 2nd layer to fill the gaps.

So you don't have to give this shithead clicks:
  
Given the astronomical gains last year, many have understandably asked if they should purchase some Bitcoin.
  
I would say no. Not because it’s a mania, a novelty, or a fad—though it certainly might be all of those things. I would say no for the same reasons I advised against buying companies like Pets.com in 1999. Not because it has no value, but because the value cannot be determined. I have no idea whether Bitcoin is worth $0 or $100,000 and if you cannot answer that question—at least within a range of 10%—buying the thing is just gambling, no different than playing roulette.
  
As Bitcoin trades at nearly $14,000, this advice must look woefully pedantic and stupid. After all, I said the same thing to a client when Bitcoin was trading at $7,000 and $10,000—and it’s doubled since then. What can the definition of stupid be if it’s not the leaving of a 100% gain on the table?
  
Pedantic or not, however, the discipline of being able to determine value is the most important thing. For every Bitcoin it causes you to miss, it helps you avoid hundreds of other passing worthless fancies, whether they be Beanie Babies, hoverboards, dotcom washouts or anything else.
  
The difference between investing and speculating is that the investor can make a determination of intrinsic value while the speculator cannot. And why can Bitcoin not be valued while a blue-chip stock or bond can? Simply because Bitcoin has no underlying yield or cash flows. If an asset lacks these features, it just cannot be valued. All methods of valuation used by successful investors, from Warren Buffett on down, approximate value based on the cash flows the asset produces. If it doesn’t produce any, good luck assessing the right price.
  
The same can be said for all currencies, not just the crypto kind. Naked yen and euros don’t produce yield or cash flows either, nor does the almighty dollar. To extract value, they must be invested in a bond or stock, or at least a Treasury bill or savings account. To make money on buying a raw currency, you need it to appreciate against the currency you used to buy it. And if you have no idea at what price that exchange should take place (and there’s no way to know because currency fluctuations are unknowable), you cannot take the gamble. Period.
  
I can tell you my estimate of the value of every asset that I’ve ever purchased. It will only be an estimate, and it will sometimes be wrong. But more often that not, it will be approximately right. I would never be able to say the same for Bitcoin. As a result, I have no position in Bitcoin, long or short, and never would.
  
As with all parabolic price increases, there will be many who ignore my pedantry. A lucky few will strike it rich, as some have with Bitcoin. Most will not. By definition, a bubble is caused by the greatest number of buyers buying at the top. This is what creates the top and what ultimately bursts the bubble.
    
Buyers often harbor the illusion they can choose their selling point on the way down. In other words, why pay attention to value? Why not buy at $14,000 and just watch closely: as soon as it hits $13,000, you can sell and avoid big losses. But this ignores the way markets work. They are not local trains where you can get off at any stop along the way. They may appear to be local trains, as they pause at a few stops in a lazy fashion, but then—all of the sudden—they run express, like a haywire NYC subway. As any rider knows, it’s no fun to be trapped on the express train and see your stop zoom by.
  
Markets are actually auctions, where the next stop is only the price borne by the next bidder. When they go down, they can go down 50% in a flash. Hence, the phenomenon of “flash crashes,” as in 2010 when the Dow plunged 1,000 points in a nanosecond. Picture an art auction in reverse, where the buyer bids $10 million for a Renoir and the next bid comes in at $1 million. There was no opportunity to get off the train along the way at $9 million or $8 million or even $7 million. If no one yells “Yes!” until “Do I hear $1 million?” then that’s the new price. No more, no less.
  
If you want to buy a Bitcoin for fun or profit, go ahead. But understand: it’s not investing, it is speculating. You might as well visit Vegas and at least be guaranteed the free drinks. As the buyers of Pets.com learned in 2000, that which has no underlying cash flows can be valued at a billion dollars one minute—but at zero the next.

This is literally why Bitcoin can help save the world.  Bitcoin has the potential to change the way we think about and use money on a global level.  One of the ways it can impact us is to make us think about how we spend it, because like you say, it has the potential to grow and be worth much more later.  Deflationary currencies have the potential to turn the tide of our out of control consumption that is destroying our planet.  I consume much less now than I did before discovering Bitcoin, I don't buy crap I don't really need and I think more about my big purchases because I now have many deflationary options to choose from instead.  When I imagine a majority being impacted like myself, I can see how Bitcoin really can change the world.  It raises awareness and educates us more than our inflationary currencies that teach us nothing but how to consume and cheat, because the system itself is a sort of cheat and we are competitive.
  
The bottom line is that we will all spend when we need to and hopefully less when we don't need to.

This is centralized services fucking up and losing money.  It is the reason for Bitcoin.  It is good for everyone because it reminds us of why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.  Because centralized services are prone to error and corruption.  It also holds the bad actors accountable by exposing their error and making people think twice about using them, as they should.  Hopefully it will incentivize them to do better. :)
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:51:59
I can tell you what is happening.  Coinbase customers are using their Bitcoin and the incentives aren't there to relieve the affects this has on the blockchain.  Freeing up space helps other businesses and won't reduce fees.  Segwit+LN is the long term scaling solution and what they should be focusing on.  I'm not against batching, just against anything that distracts from the long term scaling solutions.  Batching also has the potential to make the experience worse for coinbase customers if implemented poorly.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:16:23

@_date: 2018-01-13 20:35:29
I agree with what you said.  Coinbase has the incentive to integrate segwit+LN because they can save on fees just with the exchanges they have relationships with.  The CEO stated yesterday they are working on it.  Hammering on them now is a waste of resources.  The incentives are already there.

There won't be, there is too much competition and this fact pretty much negates everything else you said.

The end-game of deflationary cryptocurrency is that those who adopt it will learn that spending it can cost them in the long run.  This means that people will think more about how they spend their crypto because it can be more valuable in the future.  So people who don't think about what they consume will think more about it and more and more people will start to take responsibility starting with their wallet.  Our current forms of money only encourage spending and results in out of control consumption which is destroying or planet.
  
Our ability to create green energy will only improve over time and if a deflationary currency catches on, it will also have a huge energy impact due to more responsible consumption.

Bitcoin solves something that has been very difficult to solve.  Bitcoin connects humanity and gives us a mechanism for trust that we didn't have before.  That is huge and I think it is worth it.
  
Also, Bitcoin is deflationary and if it catches on, it will make people think about how they spend money and what they consume.  It has the potential to encourage humanity to consume less and avoid things we don't necessarily need because the long term cost will be too much for people.  That could help balance out the energy costs later on.  We will be seeing this argument used against us as time goes on because people will say that it will crash the economy.  I say that removing unnecessary consumption is worth any hit to our economy.  We have to consume less or we are going to destroy our planet.

Batching transactions actually has a negative impact in that you cannot use payment services because they time out before the batch processing happens.  Coinbase is making the transaction happen faster and since customers are paying a higher fee that should be alright.  The high fees due to demand are what helps motivate second layer solutions like lightning network, so in the end it serves the greater need and is temporary.  
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:51:18

We are working that out right now.  There's two parts to this.  We know LN is coming and we know it has the potential to dramatically change the fee landscape and what happens on chain.  We also know it is just the first of many L2 solutions to come.  So there really is no point shooting ourselves in the foot by increasing the blocksize when we don't know how LN will affect blocks.  The current limit also incentivizes LN innovation and other L2 solutions and since most everyone agrees that we need additional layers to scale to world adoption without sacrificing decentralization, this is desirable right now in order to push the technology in our space as soon as possible.

It is a giant nothing burger.  Any gap in the block space pressure that Coinbase creates will be filled up almost immediately by Coinbase customers and everyone else on planet earth.

The current block pressure incentivizes the development of the 2nd layer solutions we need so it is necessary that there is competition for block space.

Hopefully it is sane and the batch processing is quick or this will negatively impact customers who are willing to pay higher fees.  Slow batch processing can make it so that customers trying to pay an invoice that is timed based with a merchant might time out because the batch didn't broadcast fast enough.

And this is why you will keep banging your head against a wall.  They are not basic questions.  You acknowledged this when you pointed out that "the optimal figure isn't yet known" in our previous exchange.  We can quantify Bitcoins decentralization right now, it is not a buzzword.  We can see how nodes and miners are dispersed around the world.  We can enumerate relationships and make educated guesses.  We can't do that about the things you insist we can and the very few people qualified enough to enumerate what you are asking for don't have the answers you insist are so easy we should know them, yet you don't know them.  I think you're just a better than average concern troll, but that's just my opinion.

It is basically concern trolling. Concern trolling is when you submit content in an effort to lower confidence or straight up troll. Usually when the price drops, bored trolls come out of the woodwork to poke at the community. It ranges from organized groups with a specific agenda to individuals entertaining themselves. Really low effort examples are people just submitting the same negative piece to this sub over and over. They know it will be removed but they want people to see the headline and internalize it as much as possible so they just keep hammering us with it.

Batching Transactions is a bad idea.  It slows down the broadcast for the customers and makes it very difficult to use services like shapeshift.io and bitpay because the timed transaction can time out before the batch broadcasts.
  
When people say Coinbase is spamming the network, that is their customers using Bitcoin and that is perfectly fine.  We are not going to get layer two solutions without full blocks and the current massive adoption of bitcoin and desire to use it is pushing those developments faster.  This is good for Bitcoin.
  
People encouraging Coinbase to batch transactions might be doing it to make it hard to use Coinbase with merchants because it will slow down the broadcast of their tx.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:08:40

@_date: 2018-01-13 17:04:39
The only thing Brian has actually proven is that he is not a Bitcoin maximalist.  The sooner everyone here recognizes this the better.  Coinbase is a multi coin exchange and planning to add more.  They will try to accomplish everything they take on so sometimes that means Bitcoin is going to take a back seat, especially when what you all are crying for does nothing to solve our scaling problems or lower fees even in the short term.  Any pressure they remove from block space will be filled up very quickly by Coinbase customers who are causing all this "spam" and the rest of us.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:07:01
And batching transactions isn't going to magically make fees go down.  When fees go down, people start transacting more negating any gain.  Coinbase should focus on segwit+LN since 2nd layer is the long term scaling solution and our current conditions help incentivize 2nd layer development.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:12:24

It won't be a small market if big centralized services become hubs.  YouTube connecting all of its users alone would be huge and would eventually put major pressure on the likes of Patreon to get in the business.

It is very possible that the article is all true but you have to remember, MtGox was one of the only exchanges back then and the largest by numbers.  The current ecosystem just isn't the same.

Or this could be China removing any miners who might not go along with whatever they say and leaving state controlled/compliant miners.  If that happened, the hashing power wouldn't change too much because the miners that were put out of business would sell their machines to miners that weren't.  And it won't be an overnight process.

I can tell by your history that you are aware of the current market conditions and the demand for USDT on exchanges that don't offer USD because of the regulatory hurdle involved.

It's not really the same.  We have eyes watching exchange wallets now, we didn't back then.  We'd know if a big one was drained.  Gox was also a one man show which is why Mark didn't notice he was getting robbed until it was too late.  It's just not the same.
  
Also, as correctly points out, Gox had a majority share of bitcoin on exchanges because there was no competition back then.  So their failure had a much bigger impact than a kraken failure would.  That's not to say that the pump and dumpers won't ride the news to try and profit from it.  That will happen at a larger scale than it did back then.

I'd prefer it if we spent our time raising awareness about Roger Ver attacking Bitcoin and buying social media to attack it.  Nobody is informing newbies that  is compromised right now.
  
There is about 0% chance that Coinbase will implement an incompatible client and attack the network.  Roger Ver has already funded such endeavors.  You all are being distracted from what is really important.
   
Coinbase has no incentive to remove pressure on block space right now.  It isn't a long term scaling solution and the current conditions motivate the development of 2nd layer solutions that we all agree we need.  Like it or not them doing nothing does help on some levels.  In the end it should be celebrated that there is millions of people using the network while cautioning that a single entity is possibly growing too big.  Stay focused.

@_date: 2018-01-12 20:59:28
It is not even a short term solution.  We already know the core devs will raise the blocksize if needed once we start to have segwit\2nd layer data.  They aren't going to arbitrarily raise it and remove or reduce the incentive to develop 2nd layer solutions.
  
In the end this is Coinbase customers using their Bitcoin.  Any gap Coinbase creates in block usage will be filled very quickly so there is no point when segwit+LN is the real solution.

We shouldn't say it is completely decentralized, that's a bit of a trap, there are degrees of decentralization and "completely" is a unicorn we are always striving for.  But I agree, there should and will be centralized services built on top of Bitcoin because of its inherent decentralization.  We should strive for decentralization as much as possible but you have to pick your battles and focus in order to achieve milestones.

Just going to point out that Coinbase is a for profit company and their actions are in line with their goals.
  
Working to reduce fees only introduces opportunity for more competition and they need to control competition to an extent as a profit driven company.  The high fees are incentivizing segwit+LN development which we all agree we need.  They support more projects than just Bitcoin and have stated they are working on adding more and that all requires development time.  Peoples expectations are a little out of line with reality.  Especially since they have stated they are working on it(I don't believe this).
  
By all means speak with your wallets and push for non-profit exchanges and decentralized solutions, but don't spin your wheels on nonsense.  Coinbase has no incentive to give everyone more space in the blockchain.  Their customers are happily using it up right now and they will move when they need to, not necessarily when we say they should.
They’re not incompetent, they’re just assholes.

That's not true at all.  We can only raise the blocksize so much and still keep bitcoin decentralized.  We would hit the ceiling again and people would compete for space again.  The only real solution is a second layer like LN.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:52:07
It is working great, they haven't done anything stupid or allowed themselves to be pressured into making unnecessary changes.  So they are keeping confidence while moving us forward.  They recently upgraded the code to make side chains like LN possible so that we can scale without compromising the decentralized nature of bitcoin.  Right now they are waiting to see how side chains like LN affect the network.

Keep in mind that Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency and as a result is under heavy load as millions of people and fiat pour in.  It might not be economically feasible to send small amounts of Bitcoin to your trezor unless you can do it without paying a fee.  I know GDAX.com(Coinbase) and Gemini.com allow this.  Pay attention to your fees when transacting.  Wallets are still immature in this area and often charge way too much.

Ver bankrolled bCash and it is centralized around whatever he wants.  He has admitted multiple times that it is "my project" and he gets very upset if you call his project bCash because he has spent a lot of money on marketing it.  If Ver died he would no longer be propping up the price, Wu would stop mining it because Ver isn't paying him anymore and if would die.  It is 100% centralized around Ver's control, it is his project.

What country do you live in?  You'll need to sign up with an exchange that serves your country so that you can transfer the bitcoin to it in order to cash it out.  I assume you want to cash it out since you want to transfer it to your bank account.  Depending on the exchange you end up using they may have a wallet that can sweep the funds.
  
If I got Bitcoin for Christmas I would just put it somewhere safe for a few years since it didn't cost me anything.  I would transfer it to a wallet I control in case my boss had a copy of the private keys.

Why would they expose themselves to the open market for their bank-to-bank settlement layer when they can license the tech and run it among themselves without the exposure?  They just cash settle the token, it doesn't need to have derived value from an open market in that scenario.

I read 55 Billion locked up for 54 months.  After 54 months 1 Billion a month is released.  This right here is why I will not invest time and resources on ripple.  It is a centralized system I have no say in that is going to make the owners rich if I find a way to add value to their system.  Why would I or a company work hard to put value in their system knowing they can start dumping into my hard work in 54 months?  And that's just what they have in escrow!  There is still 45 Billion floating.  The truth is ripple is really attractive for speculators and pretty much only speculators.  I think it is a dead end.  Especially since they license their tech.  If it is good enough to use, it is good enough to license without the risk of the open market.

There's an argument to be made that Andreas has done nothing but good for our community while Roger started off doing good but became really shitty and the bad probably outweighs any good at this point.  So your argument that Roger has also done good is negated by Roger's own actions.  Kinda sucks for people who have to defend him but I guess a job is a job.

Bitcoin is the currency of the internet because it lives and breathes only on the internet.  Without the internet there is no Bitcoin.
  
It is because people are actually using it that its limits are being pushed and that is a good thing.  This builds confidence in the system whether you personally can see that or not.  It is happening and has been for years.  This is not new territory for Bitcoin.

You need to be verified to use GDAX so it is harder to sybal attack and make them waste money on fees.  If they allowed it on Coinbase.com they would have to make it more restrictive which would add a lot more friction for new users buying small amounts of bitcoin.  What they should do is make it so verified users can send X amount of free sends per month from Coinbase. 
  
Oh also, I bet GDAX is separate and the books are different.  The exchange fee model might be covering the sends where the Coinbase.com model doesn't.

If you cant afford to buy bitcoin you really cant afford to mine it.  Mining takes expensive specialized hardware.  And renting mining equipment will always result in less Bitcoin than if you had just bought Bitcoin with the money.  You can buy small amounts of Bitcoin on exchanges so you really have no excuse.

The longer Bitcoin survives the more investors will see it as something they need in their investment portfolio.  If you aren't exposed to it you aren't exposed to that growth potential.  Lots of people are fine sitting on the sidelines where it is safe but many are eager for an investment that is accessible and fair with huge upside potential.  So for people like myself, Bitcoin is something I can't get anywhere else and so I hold it.  Bitcoin has made me a millionaire.

xmr.to has an onion address if you want to further obfuscate.  Stuff like not re-using addresses and the like is just common sense.  Delaying your conversions also messes up timing based analysis of amounts and you can only do that on the bitcoin side so it is pretty ineffective.  Monero will have native support for the i2p network soonish and that further ensures fungibility.

I don't think so.  These people weren't hired to contribute to core.  They had already been doing it for free long before blockstream.  This discussion of the core developers and how and if they should get paid goes back many years.  I'd say it started to get heated in 2012/2013.  Some wanted them to work for free so they could have no bias and others wanted to ensure they could contribute full time to bitcoin by giving them a salary.  There has been a lot of discussion about the merits of everything in between.  In the end these people need to live a life they want to live and others will always have an opinion about how they should live it.  There is no evidence blockstream has any kind of centralized control and the members of it that I am aware of have been working towards the common goal of decentralization for a long time.  They have a good track record and they aren't attacking bitcoin in a way that other large core contributors are calling out.  And I believe they would call it out if it was happening.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:43:23

According to them in order to contribute to bitcoin core you need to be self made or poor and have no job what so ever that has anything to do with crypto currency or they will be making all of your decisions.  Also you have to renounce your social security benefits so you can't be biased towards the government.
  
It's just another attack like the many used against core by that particular group.  Their attacks are weak individually so they try and pile them on in hopes you will die from a thousand cuts.

Let's assume the best and being compelled to do something doesn't mean blackmail.  I think they would only act if it was in the best interest of bitcoin and we have seen today that the threat of a fork isn't compelling enough to act.  So if they did it would need to be justified.

They are using existing satellites to transmit recent bitcoin blocks.

It is not odd.  Money is the most important thing to Roger and he has spent a lot of it on marketing BCash.  He becomes insecure when you call it bcash because it makes him feel like he wasted his money and money is the most important thing to Roger Ver.  Wasting money is not an option.  
  
There is more to this too.  Roger Ver is used to everyone following his instructions and doing what he say's.  So when the interviewer didn't follow his instructions it was like a double whammy.  People just don't do that!  This guy just made the wrong moves and Roger lost it.  Makes perfect sense when you understand Roger Ver.

The thing about a troll army is that you have to care and feed it every day.  Even when there isn't anything interesting happening.  Sure you end up with the occasional rarepepe scheme and the like but you have to keep them busy or your operation will fall apart.

Money laundering happens all the time, some people don't even know they are doing it.  It is just how they get paid and spend money and they know nothing else.  Others do it willingly and will use any means necessary to accomplish their goal.  The fact that people think Bitcoin is useful for money laundering itself is an indication of value.  The more it is used for money laundering the greater that metric.  In a way, this is good for bitcoin.  It shows that bitcoin has value and can be used for its intended purpose which is to store value and transmit it.  If it failed at either of those it wouldn't be useful and people wouldn't use it.

That's stupid because ZEC is not totally private and in order to send private transactions you need to acquire non-private ZEC first.  So you are going back into the clear, then private then back into the clear before you go back to BTC.  This is more risk as far as I am concerned unless there is a way to go directly from BTC or XMR to private ZEC to BTC which I'm not aware of.
  
Also, unless you are breaking up the transaction into multiple transactions you can see the amounts on the public ZEC so people could track the BTC amount that disappears into XMR and then a ZEC transaction for the same amount.  People monitoring these chains would see that.  So you have to pay way more fees just to use ZEC which isn't necessary and possibly a liability.

Unfortunately we don't have a good way to poll the whole community in a way that one vote equals one person so that is hard to gauge.  But if you look at what developers are saying, they are almost all in agreement that we do not need 2x right now.

The opposite would happen.  USDT primarily thrives on crypto only exchanges and there is no option to flee to fiat so people would have no choice but to flee to bitcoin\altcoins.

The crypto only exchange pressure could offset a reaction on the fiat exchanges and it could be a nothing burger.

I can pick any dip in our history and draw arrows to it after the fact and claim I know what is up.  That doesn't actually mean I do because nobody does or they aren't being public about it.
  
If you want this sort of thing to fly, you need to start predicting correctly what will happen, you need a history of being right before we will take this sort of thing seriously.  Otherwise its just another price shitpost and we get a lot of that around here, obviously most of it will be removed.  Especially when it is arbitrarily calling people stupid.

Not sure why you bothered with that sub to begin with.  Roger made that sub because the mods here wouldn't let him use this sub to push his bullshit.  So he *acquired* rbtc and has been using it as his personal propaganda platform since.  He uses it to push his agendas and promote his business.  He bought bitcoin.com to further that agenda.  He buys votes on twitter to push his propaganda and promotes people like Craig Wright to drive a wedge in the community and attempt to lend credibility to his echo chamber.  You only help him by participating there.

That's right.  It is not sustainable.  If it becomes too cheap, people will game the system to raise the fees.  Be it miners or users, there is nothing to stop it.
  
Making a bitcoin more divisible does nothing to stop this, nor does increasing the blocksize.  The available space will be filled by legitimate transactions or spammers taking advantage.  This is why most every expert agrees we need layer two solutions that are outside the control of miners.

It looks like they are not banning all crypto and are encouraging blockchain investment.  You cant encourage blockchain investment and ban fiat.
  
Maybe my interpretation is wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:14:12
They are aware.  That's why they have said they are going to try and make their blockchain totally private some day in the future.

This is a sub for talking about bitcoin, not a sub for talking about bch and it's various communities.  Just because X community says stupid shit and pushes lies, doesn't mean we need to pay attention to them and constantly debunk them over and over.  That's just free advertising for them.  They don't have any nuclear codes that we need to worry about.

Greg wins and gets to spend the money.  That's the point of a bet.

The problem is that some of the A:'s are just trying to antagonize us.  We know that the market is volatile, nobody is going to tell you it isn't.  When you have people who's participation here is mostly antagonizing we are going to react negatively to them.  That's just human nature.  Don't antagonize us and we won't tell you to fuck off.

That makes no sense.  How would making a bitcoin more divisible suddenly enable micro payments?  I don't think you know much about how bitcoin works given the question.  Making a bitcoin more divisible doesn't suddenly create more block space or incentivize miners to include low fee transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:19:55
No you won't.  That is a lot of extra work just to avoid 10% tax.

I would do this.
  
1) Shapeshift.io your shitcoin to monero.  
2) xmr.to your monero to btc.
  
xmr.to has an onion address too.

Untested does not automatically equal flawed.  Untested means you need to be careful and do review.  People like Greg Maxwell and Company have the expertise to do this in a responsible and reliable way and Ver won't agree.  When I see Greg Maxwell offer to bet 1000 BTC on this and Ver ignore him, I absolutely know Ver is full of shit because Maxwell has proven himself over and over.

As far as I understand it, segwit and the side chains will fix that.  Even if there was 0 fee right now, having to wait 10 minutes for your payment to get in a block still discourages your use case.  Then there is the fact that the $1 soda could cost you $100 dollars in profits in the near term and I just don't see people buying soda with bitcoin right now.  Bitcoin needs to stop having so much upside potential for people to spend it like you say.  The more bitcoin demonstrates its potential, the more it discourages spending.  That's how I feel at least.
  
also makes a good point about taxes that I forgot.

He did not demonstrate ultimate management and control over the Ethereum blockchain.  He demonstrated his influence and that is not the same.  Influence is like currency and can be spent until you have none.  He spent some of his influence when he decided to use it to convince the majority to fork.

Can you give an example of the type of barriers you are talking about?  I recently signed up and bought on an exchange and I found it stupid easy to do.  I downloaded a wallet on my iPhone and moved the coins there and that was also friction less.
