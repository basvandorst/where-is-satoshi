I want to confirm something, if you don't mind me butting in. My wife and I switched from AT&amp;T to T-Mobile this past Sunday. I went to BB and got two Samsung A157s ($15 each). We then went to T-Mobile and traded in those phones so that we could keep our Lumia 920s to unlock. (we'll sell my wife's, but I intend to use the 920 on T-Mobile) She got a 925 and I already had a 521 from this past summer's HSN deal (and I got the cheapest flip phone available to satisfy the terms). Everything is working fine in that regard.
HOWEVER, while we were there, the rep told us that, because we were trading in two dumbphones, we would only get up to $200 etf back. The T-Mobile website doesn't mention anywhere that the ETF cancellation is tied to the phone - it seems to imply that the ETF is $200 for a dumbphone line and $350 for a smartphone line, whereas the trade-in credit is based only on the phone. Can you help clarify?
I'll fight tooth and nail for the full ETF, as we are about $230-250 each, so looking at approximately $80. Just wondering how hard I'll have to fight.

If you guys are based in WA, how about getting first dibs on the upcoming WP8.1 devices? =P

What this means to me is that you could maybe put $10 toward some music subscription service that supports offline playback to save your data package? If you used someone that had random playlists that updated every night, it seems like you could have a nice mix of music and save some money in the long run.
