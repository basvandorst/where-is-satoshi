I dont know if you have read any of Talebs's books but he has been criticized before for his theories (black swan being the most popular). Nassim is just extremely good in counter-arguing criticism that results in neither he being wrong nor the criticism being right.

Technically you are right. I don't know you are downvoted. There isn't a mention of bitcoin .
@_date: 2019-06-17 03:56:53
Not defending cloud mining (because I think it's a scam) but this kind of propositions happen in the real world as well. The reason? It's about the time value of money. Cloud miners need and want upfront capital and profits to not only pay up on their hardware asap but to capture earnings which they can use to get more funding , or a better line of credit for more miners. It's the lottery situation: you rather 3 million out of a "10 million prize pool" NOW or 20,000 a month for the next x years.

u can try. but most people will not risk it because it is against their terms (paypal) and people are weary of getting scammed. Unless your reputable on the forum ur trading on, i doubt u can buy bitcoins directly.

I will answer one portion of ur thread since there are alot of things to cover. 
Firstly, read this 
That should get you covered on where the major exchanges are and who you can generally buy from.
Next, go over to  it is a fairly large forum where people do one to one or small time BTC transaction to and fro, for cash and other liquid investments.
And Lastly, you should go to  , where you can see your closest seller, by distance. if meeting up one to one makes you comfortable, than this should be a good alternative.
To set up ur wallet. go either to Blockchain.info , Armoury , or any well know rep wallet creation sites. When you have an address and have transfer BTC into it, be sure to (As added security), to make a paper wallet. more info on that can be found [here]( Additionally,ANY password that you use to open a bitcoin wallet should be SHA256 compliant (my personal choice). go over to  or any SHA256 password generator and create a password. I know that it is long and lengthly, but make sure u write it somewhere safe and never keep multiple copies of that password. 
That should get you started for now. :)

@_date: 2013-03-06 02:09:29
came here to say that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:38:04
yes. People are slowly trying to advocate the idea of mBTC, rather than one BTC. I know it doesn't help when you read of transactions going for 100BTCs to the thousands and think to yourself, "how do you afford that". 
Thats why it be better if MtGox and exchange sites started showing currency in mBTC.
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:29:18
think about it. if traders were never interested in bitcoin, and their attractive ROI, why the hoots would they even put money in it. And if that did not happen, would the value of BTC be at where it is?
Sure they try to play their tricks and be sly with their motives, but that just one of the things that will inevitably happen with something like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-02-24 22:02:06

@_date: 2013-03-25 21:03:22
to be honest, it be better trying your luck out at mining litecoin. it is still profitable and claims to hedge against the rise of ASIC miners.
and yes , i was able to put an avalon asic into my cart so it seems that it can be bought and is being sold in batches. 
but for 5000+USD for a rig ? takes a lot of thinking through...
@_date: 2013-02-21 13:07:06
agreed. currently i use that to monitor the markets.

not about hardware. rather more on getting ASICS. sure you can say that you can get 10 ATI 7970 Running, but it isnt worth running compared to just investing it BTC.

**quickly ordered the lowest model ($150)**
??? Things like these just make me mad. Always read about what others say about the product. if its marketed to be so attractive, it is unlikely to be what it seems.

wait the announcement. unlikely u get ur money back anytime soon dad.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:32:19
it has been posted before. and I would say it might be some form of bot trying to purposely Ddos the exchange. MtGox cant really handle the lag during peak volumes  so someone might take advantage of that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:20:42
mokawa, note that it is not bitcoin that is tedious and inefficient, but rather current day banking systems that are too rigid and lack flexibility to adjust to the idea of bitcoin and purchasing them. 
additionally, if it wasnt for the fact that bitcoins are so hard to buy from fiat currencies, the price of bitcoin would not be at where it is. imagine if bitcoins was more easily accessible, and where the rate of cash inflow is faster than the rate where bitcoins can be mined, wouldn't the price of bitcoin shoot up tremendously?
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:40:50
they do not do shit for bitcoin?
Dude, firstly calm down. They help drive **interest** and **value** into the bitcoin market. 
you talk about **acceptance**? i assume you talk about it being measured in terms of how well known and popular it is. you think that these speculators or traders chase away the people interested in btc? No. they know that the more interest in btc, the more willingness in it. and what happens when willingness and ability to purchase meets? theres **demand** for the product. in this case, BTC. 
you also mentioned about "**use for things we need to buy or services"**. if the demand for BTC goes up, merchants and sellers **will** take notice because of the benefits already being promoted from btc (i assume i dont need to tell you what they are) and the big commotion which was indirectly caused by the traders itself. 
If you have a specific reason for hating on them and posting it here, please share what is specifically, instead of causing confusion for new and current btc users.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:21:55
i will be interested to buy if the rates are right. PM me.
@_date: 2013-04-21 12:23:58
but everyone carries a phone. therefore, everyone *can*carry bitcoins. (of course this depends on general widespread adoption of bitcoin)
@_date: 2013-02-19 18:49:15
if you read down the thread, it says he studied it for 3 years. So i am sure that he is not new to the concept of bitcoin. but i would think he is just being very reserved and general in his comment.
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:45:54
i think i get what you mean. Yes, i agree that if you get your friends involved, the situation can be...*sticky* per se.
Dont worry, I think mistakes like this are good to learn from. besides, you are right, it is only $150 dollars. can you imagine if next time there was snake oil being sold to you at $1000 or $5000 ? haha, we all been there once.

I feel that maybe the FX example wasnt so strong to exemplify what SIGNW is saying, even though he is making very valid points. There is some psychological barrier because many of the people that I promote Bitcoin to will always start of with, "what! 1 bitcoin is $___ , I cant afford that!". It is only after I tell them the divisibility of one BTC, do they seem slowly more interested. To add to that, I think it is pretty bad that most of the illustrations on Bloomberg, Cnbc .etc, all like showing the Physical bitcoin (casascius coin). To the mass consumers, even if they do intend to invest, their perception of bitcoin will be ingrained into the "One WHOLE Physical Coin" thing , rather than viewing it digitally. I feel that is the problem nowadays is with how media outlets illustrate the idea of bitcoin to the viewers.

@_date: 2013-04-03 03:07:00
highly agreed. One of the fundamental points of bitcoin wallet security is NEVER store all coins in one wallet. People always advocate putting coins set for different purposes in different wallets. and because of the nature of bitcoins, one can never publicly link a set of wallets to one individual. and this is just talking about online wallets. not even considering paper wallets (not sure about that).
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:03:38
1 Qn. how do you use modulated scripting? 
and how do you link it to the Buy/Sell in Mtgox?
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:33:50
even if you wanted to buy one now , it is highly limited in supply.
Avalon just opened a third batch and got sold out even at a 300% plus mark up price.
BFL is ur only option, and it isnt a good one. they have a bad rep for their delivery and have not even showed real proof of fulfilling their current orders.
The only thing you can do is wait for new asics to appear.
