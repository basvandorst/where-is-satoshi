@_date: 2016-06-25 00:49:16
I feel good that Invested 10000$ at 560$ yesterday... time to cash out maybe Keepo?
@_date: 2016-06-13 22:26:15
Yeah i lost over 33k in bitcoins via scammer with paypal sadly. I cashed out 50k at 525$ rate in cash...

Well i use apple pay because it supports interac and any machnw with nfc. 
I have around 25 bitcoins account spread around and 24 of them has 5 btc each. 
My personal wallet ( for spending issue or emergency ) has 3 btc. 
I personally recommend spreading out your bitcoin if someone hacks your bitcoin account with all your money. Your 100% fucked :)

Im sad... i cashed out at 700$ CAD each bitcoin... it was 200.50004000 BtC. These bitcoins were from trading and stuff from last year. 
I like the canadian dollar to be shitty. Its actually great! Cheaper electronics if you compare to the US

Whenever I buy bitcoin from coinbase, I always transfer it to Blockchain.info because they will never cancel anything or freeze anything. 
Most of the times I just buy it from the bitcoin atm where I live. :)
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:54:45
Oh im waiting until it hits around 1.1k. 
So i can sell it and buy an apartment for my self.
I bought it at 329$ USD like a year ago.

It decreases the chances of losing all of my money at the same time..
All my backup codes are random generated letters :).
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:36:08
Hey its 789.24$ now 
@_date: 2017-01-23 09:16:23
Its mostly just stolen products from amazon tbh
@_date: 2017-01-31 21:30:07
Coinbase can fuck you over js. For example: if you sell at 1200$ but it suddenly drops to 1100$. Coinbase will either cancel or keep the coins or just give u it at 1100$

Hello, Fellow Canadian from Vancouverite here :)
Open a blockchain.info account transfer all your money there.
Go to a waves coffee because all the shops ive gone to has a bitcoin machine.  I was like WTF...
Then cash out from there usually a 30-45 min wait drink some waves coffee while you wait. They also accept bitcoin as payment which is fucking awesome! You can hit up different waves shops, if your taking a 1000$ at a time. Above 1k you need Identification which is retarded on my opinion. But i take 980$ at a time = no identification and because I'm a savage :P
Their fee is like 1%... but its worth :).
Or just google " bitcoin atm "
And you'll be fine 
I personally wouldnt do localbitcoin.com because shady and you might get robbed sometimes. Most of money is from drug dealers. 
How did i know that?
I was a bitcoin user since the early days. :) 
@_date: 2017-01-24 17:55:02
hmmm.. I'll think about it because I'm very clumsy with stuff. If I lose it wouldn't I be fucked?
@_date: 2017-01-23 08:36:38
Yes it does but its shady as fuck. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 09:03:08
Oh god i think the price is going to drop tbh because Asian people are using bitcoin, so their going to take out their money give it out =/.
I only used 0.2 btc for my chinese new year shopping hue hue. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 09:05:39
I would recommend spreading out your bitcoin. If your account gets hacked your FUCKED... then your 24k down. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:30:11
Hopefully you didnt buy yet because it just dropped 100$
@_date: 2017-01-23 08:31:02
Yes it will but there is only 2 machines in amsterdam. If my research
@_date: 2016-11-17 18:18:17
I'm going to wait another 10$ because when I cash out it takes 1% fee =/  I want my 1k per btc 
@_date: 2017-01-23 11:54:56
If i get hacked with 1 account that has all my money. IM FUCKED.
I'M going to become from Wealthy to poor in a sec because there is no way of getting your money back because its bitcoin :) 
From my prospective: i rather get hacked lose 5 btc... then cash out all of bitcoin than losing 122 btc at once from a hacker.
25 accounts are much safer even though it increase the chances.

how????
