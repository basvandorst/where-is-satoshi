Will do thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:46:04
Sure.. you can go to this link to see who you can pay:
We'll be adding more billers shortly.. If there is  Biller that we don't have submit their name and we will go to work adding them.
@_date: 2015-01-28 04:57:38
We have now moved from Beta to full production due to overwhelming demand.. Thanks for all the support
@_date: 2015-01-23 12:59:05
Yes it is a revamp. Most of our work is been on the backend. We are currently working through updating the front end.
@_date: 2015-01-28 04:28:01
Yes..We People need to register otherwise we have a few issues:
1.) We need the Biller to know who to credit for the Payment
2.) If we don't have payment Payor (remit) information we will run into Legal issues.. As A U.S company we're still subject to U.S Laws.
@_date: 2015-01-23 12:59:42
Thank you. These are all extremely helpful suggestions. Please continue to look through it and make any other suggestions as we are very open to updating the site so that the experience for the user is much better.
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:51:33
I understand where you're coming from ... but we do have costs associated with this service. If we don't cover our costs we will create challenges to continuing the service.

First let us start by apologizing for the massive delay. There is no excuse but there is a reason and you deserve to know what happened.  The next thing we need to tell you is that we have been working hard (Successfully) to either refund our customers or process payments through other means (More on that later) to Part of the issue recently is that the main person that processes payments was out for nearly a month dealing with some serious family issues.. Technical issues followed which did not allow us access to some key components of the website.. But these have been the least of our problems... and if it wasn't such a difficult and troubling issue this last part would be an interesting conversation piece... When we established the business we made it a point to speak directly to the Bank, explain the business in detail, delivery all of our paperwork and make ourselves available from Day one for any questions that they had. We did this so that we would not have issues with the Bank especially given the fact that we are a bitcoin business.
So.. what was the problem?: Despite a through and detailed explanation of our business with people at the highest level at each of these banks and despite the fact that they opened our accounts and approved our business.. within months Bank after Bank closed our accounts without warning, held the funds until they got around to cutting checks back to us (which is odd because once they closed the accounts we no longer had a bank to deposit into), and stopped or ignored payments that we made on behalf of our customers. 
The first time that this happened we wrote a mass email to customers advising them that we had this issue and that we had found a replacement bank. We did the same thing the second time, and we notified customers the third time. The person that oversees payment processing being out certainly did not help this most recent time. We have opened a new bank account but given the experience that we have had so many times we have continued to process refunds back to customers and process payments using alternative means. We want to leave it to you as to how you would like to proceed.  Your Bitcoin is Safe.If you would like us to process a full refund please email us at admin Please include your Bitcoin address in the subject line. We have also made ourselves available to speak with customers, so if you would like to speak with us feel free to reach out.
Again we apologize deeply for all of the confusion.

We already take Doge as a form of payment.

Nice..It looks like this service is for the Netherlands.

We are a Kansas LLC but we operate in a MO Office. Feel free to search the Kansas Secretary of State's website. In addition in order to open our Bank accounts and rent Space we had to produce all of our documentation.

Thanks for being a customer. we do appreciate it. We already are working on lowering our fee. We expect to lower it in the next two weeks or less. Regarding larger bills; we would consider that I hope to have an update for you after the next price change.

...actually fee based payments are the fastest growing form of Bill payment in America today... not sure why.. maybe it's because the banks are structuring their businesses to support folks in higher income brackets.. in any case.. different strokes.
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:55:25
fees at 1%. try it!
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:54:47
1% now, check it out.
@_date: 2013-06-04 17:18:40
It already does happen with smaller utilities that we have been able to make agreements with. We will hopefully in the next few weeks be able to open this up completely, but due to regulations, we are required to have an agreement with the Biller in order to accept your bill payment. (We are working on becoming an agent of a money transmitter which would allow us to take any payment)
If you would like us to see if your utility company will give us this kind of permission, feel free to contact us. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 02:19:09
Currently USA only but with plans to expand over time. Keep an eye out for updates! :-)
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:36:20
You can do that, and people do that all the time. The convenience factor of our service is that we allow you, the customer to cut those steps out. If you convert the btc to usd, it goes something like this:
1. Sell Coins on exchange (get charged a percentage)
2. Drop coins to dwolla (get charged a fee)
3. ACH withdraw to your bank (wait a few days)
4. Pull out checkbook
5. Write Check, Mail Envelope. DONE
With us:
1. Pay bill with bitcoin DONE
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:31:18
They are free to voice their concerns. They have no reason to be grumpy now though, we listen. :-)
Fees at 1%. Enjoy!
@_date: 2013-06-04 19:11:59
No fees for the service. When we opened we offered 1% which is still incredibly low. We partnered up with bitpay to offer 0%. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:29:26
You are paying us in bitcoins for your bill. Thats it. We handle the rest. It is a direct payment from your perspective. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:57:03
We are currently restructuring the fees, keep an eye out for updates. Till then, enjoy the 1%!
@_date: 2013-06-04 16:21:27
Unfortunately not. We have strict anti money laundering regulations to follow. All bill payments received must be written out to the company that it is owed to. The company will be called and the information provided will be verified. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 17:21:24
As long as this is all acknowledged in the notes of your order, you should be fine. We just need to know who's bill it is, and who "you" the person paying the bill is, and what their relationship to the person who's bill it is. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:52:08
Thanks for the great review and for your business!

@_date: 2013-04-24 13:37:05
Thanks for all the feedback everybody! We have just raised our limit to 1500 per day per customer so that it will cover the "average" rent.

here, for you! 1%

Opening an office in Canada only helps us for Canada customers. The moment a company does business in the US, they are subject to us regulations. Same as MtGox. They are in Japan, but they still must be registered as a money service business in the United States even though they are not based here. Legal mumbo jumbo. Haha
@_date: 2013-06-12 02:40:40
We have been offering these services in the USA for 2 or 3 months. Canada is in the works! Stay tuned. 
Ps to the O.P./site owner: nice site design... I think I know where you got your inspiration. Good luck with your business! 
@_date: 2013-05-11 06:56:24
Nothing suspicious about it! :) We want to build our customer base, and offering our services free for 6 months are the way we have chosen to go about it. This is our Promotional period. 0% is not permanent. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:00:50
Thanks! We thought so too :-)
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:22:33
At this point, if you have fiat, by all means, use it to pay your bills. Our service is for people who have bitcoins and would prefer to pay their bills WITH bitcoin directly, rather then convert their bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-05-11 20:01:19
Eventually. We are working on a system where almost any biller can be paid; currently, we are waiting on all the paperwork to process.
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:06:30
That is on "the board". :-)
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:10:24
thanks for the kind words. I am glad you are as thrilled about our service as we are!
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:51:31
We [revised the fee schedule]( 1%, Promotional till we restructure our fees. 
@_date: 2013-05-11 20:09:05
We have to comply with federal regulations.
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:27:01
Oops! Point us in the direction and we will take care of them. I'm surprised they were missed by all 3 of us. We spent almost a week testing and checking the site. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 06:01:26
Sounds like a company gambling with their future. Though you could luck out and have things turn out positively, if the prices drop like they just recently did, your company would get majorly screwed. 
@_date: 2013-06-08 16:13:09
For a first time investor who doesn't fully understand how trading works. I would suggest coinbase. It's a simple, click and buy website. (You don't have to know how trading works)
If you want to try your hand at trading. Camp bx has the option of sending in a cashiers check. Then there is no hold I believe.
