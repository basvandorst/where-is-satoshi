What those holders dont realize is they cant get out as fast as they would want, because all exchanges have withdraw limits, when you want to cash out because its dropping you will not be able and you will suffer, the exchanges have those limits because there is not enough cash to pay everyone their bitcoins at high prices. and thats a reality.
