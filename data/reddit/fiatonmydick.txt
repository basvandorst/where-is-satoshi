Wow there you have it, subscriptions are increasing!  Never mind that traffic to is decreasing month over month consistently.  The subscriptions to are increasing too, guess they are gaining momentum over there as well.  Woo litecoin is clearly the future.
Meanwhile in real life:

Hey what do you know, yet another illegal use case!  I'm sure mainstream adoption is right around the corner.

Yes the [rise of spam transactions]( and the [dismal amount of actual retail transactions](  The VC has produced nothing of value.  It has produced no use cases, and attracted no new users.  Your remittance anecdotal evidence means nothing, if so many people are using it to remit, why's the price tanking?

It dropped 2% in the last 7 days 12% in the last 30 days and 53% in the last 365 days.  I suppose local bitcoins is to blame for all of that as well.

If by large audience you mean the less than one million current bitcoin users word-wide, then sure.

Instead of invent conspiracy theories maybe you should take a look at some facts.  The price is falling because there's no demand for coins, adoption is not happening.  It's not the government, it's not the mafia, and it's not the boogie man.  It's a simple lack of demand.

That's the kind of intellectual argument I've come to expect from you, bitbubbly.

The Y axis is the website's popularity compared to every other website in the world.  It's straight from Alexa, bubs.

$50 million would be terrible, the remittance market is $436 billion annually (.01%).  That's why Bitpay's $150 million (most of which is mining related and thus unsustainable) is completely laughable in the context that Visa alone processes $3.5 trillion annually.  Fact is bitcoin is completely irrelevant to the real world right now.

So where are all the users?  Why are their under 1 million total wallets with coins in it?  Where are the use cases?  Why has the price fallen 18 months straight if new users are coming on board?  Why is the transactional volume USD 100% stagnant for 18 months?  Why is traffic to every bitcoin related website falling drastically?

Because nobody cares about p2p, it's not instant, and it's quasi-decentralized and getting less and less so by the day.  Futuristic is a meaningless term, and really the only thing bitcoin has going for it is being programmable.  In reality it's used mainly by criminals, has no real use cases, and is ripe with scams and hacks.

Is it really?  All of the VC is going towards exchanges, payment processors, and mining.  Almost none of it is going into stuff that would give the block chain any real use cases.  If the blockchain doesn't obtain use cases outside of illegal activities, all that VC is essentially useless.  It's money that's invested in extracting money from the bitcoin system to the outside, never to be seen in the bitcoin ecosystem again.
