shitcoins are increasing the volatility of bitcoin by diverting funds, lowering the order book depth. Price fluctuation between different cryptos also produces illusive speculating opportunity and thus creating many bubbles. Shitcoins with no or duplicated use case really need to go. They're not helping at all. Most of all, they are even worse than fiat.

And that's why you are suggested to wait for more than 1 confirmation. The more confirmation a transaction gets, the less likely it will be in an orphaned block.

Imagine this: you are very hungry and you must eat today or you will starve to death. You got some bread that can feed you for a week. Now, I'm going to play a game with you, with dice. Throw the dice and If you got 1/2/3/4/5, you win. I'll give you more bread that will feed you for ten weeks. But if you got 6, you'll lose all your bread. Will you play it with me?
Now please figure it out. What you were doing is gamble. You are confident that Bitcoin will rise because you admire it as a programmer, but it doesn't mean that you should invest more than you can lose.
I, myself, put 99.9&amp; of my money in bitcoin too. I only cash out when I need to spend. I will not deny that I'm gambling. But I can afford to lose it because I'm still a student. My parents can help me if anything goes wrong.
I know programming too, as well as economics and mathematics. But I will not invest things into Bitcoin that are not able to lose because that's a stupid thing to do.
Now, tell me why people need to buy an insurance priced $100/year even though they only have 0.00001&amp; chance of losing $10,000,000 in a year. Why are people spending $100 to avoid a $1 average/expected loss? Because they are sane and you are not.

These kind of shops are all over China. Many retailers in China only accept payment from WeChat Pay or AliPay, which are two major electronic payment service providers. But unfortunately the Chinese government had banned bitcoin from being used for any kind of payment since 2014, otherwise we could've been seeing a massive adoption of cryptos in China.

I'm calculating my investment in terms of BTC already. I invested X amount of BTC and I already got more than X BTC back \(and getting more each day\). They have real mining facilities setup in Iceland and by checking the blockchain you can see they really payout freshly mined bitcoins \(mainly from Antpool\) but not the bitcoin I paid them at the first place. Also, You are wrong about the meaning/definition of a Ponzi scheme.
I don't like Antpool much though.

I'm the one who has breaken even \(in BTC\) already and still receiving payouts every single day with life time cloud mining contract bought last year. Buying those contracts now \(if you can\) is surely non\-profitable in terms of BTC or even fiat, just validate that early investors always win bigger.


Please read the definition of a 'ponzi'. You're like those who refer Bitcoin as a ponzi while not understanding what even a ponzi is.


which company isn't?


Someone has to do it \(mine bitcoin\) eventually, otherwise no one will be mining BTC but all be hodling, making the mining difficulty drop and then mining will be more profitable than hodling again. It's an auto\-adjust open transparent dynamic market. People invest into things that they think that are profitable, with risk.


\[Insert any businessman's name here\] is a liar and a fraud.
Perhaps cloud mining contract is less profitable than hodling bitcoin now, but you really can't say anything that is not the most profitable a scam or a fraud. I really don't understand why you hate it so much.

Via exchanges like bitfinex: borrow others' BTC to sell and pay them interest (borrow 1 btc, repay 1.001btc tomorrow). If BTC became cheaper tomorrow, you can buy 1.001btc and keep the rest of the fiat.
Via brokers like CME group: buy a bitcoin future short contract at 6k, if BTC price is 5k on the expiration date, you earn yourself 1k.

I rarely short BTC, except for really-really-short-term trading.
I believe BTC will be going up in the long run.

2.33x means I'm putting 333% of my money on bitcoin. If the price just touch 6500 for a second, triggering auto-sell, I'll be broke. Can't buy back. I quit leveraged trading meaning I'm now hodling 100% of my invested money on bitcoin.
I do leveraged trading because I can't gain more BTC by simply hodling BTC. I think I'm just a coward.

If I hodl on a 2.33x leverage, I'll be screwed if btc drops to 6500.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:27:13
When you actually want to hodl but sold your btc, you are shorting btc already. I decided to give up trading and start hodling already, so it's up to you. CME future market is still month away so I guess there'll still be a further price drop? I think people overly longed BTC at the moment based on [this chart]( But no one knows if some big whales will invest millions and billions in BTC soon and cause it go to $10,000 without coming back again.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:04:30
Electrum haven't announced that they'll support B2X at this moment, so you've better move your coins somewhere else. You can move them to exchanges with b2x future market (so that you can dump your coin post-fork asap or even pre-fork) like hitbtc, coinbase, bitfinex. But I personally don't trust them so I won't put too much BTC on exchanges for fear that they got hacked or eat my money.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:25:18
Sold 2x and bought BT1 through bitfinex already. HitBTC offers a better rate but I don't trust it. Will sell BTU and hold BCC(Bitcoin Core; against Bitcoin Unlimited, not Bcash) again after the fork, and send all my original-chain bitcoin back to my ledger nano S on the 1st day of 2018. Hopefully bitfinex won't get hacked before I own my money again.

If “bitcoin future” is lower than bitcoin, you buy bitcoin future immediately when you sell your bitcoin, and you earned the price gap already. No one ask you to buy “bitcoin in the future”.
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:33:06
If everyone is doing it, the price gap will go smaller and smaller and eventually not profitable after fees
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:39:06
Assume you bought 1 bitcoin future at 4k, sold 1 bitcoin at 6k, you have 2k left. When the bitcoin future expire, lets say the bitcoin price is 1k now, you get 1k back and now you have 3k, which can buy 1 bitcoin at 1k and leave you with 2k. If the price is 999k, you get 999k back and now you have 1001k, buy one bitcoin at 999k, 2k earned.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:13:00
perhaps the trading volume and market depth of bitcoin future is not high enough?
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:16:46
It's not a loophole, it works if the price gap is big enough.
Trading is a two-sides thing, if someone is stupid enough that he/she would call(buy)/put(sell) in the future market at a price higher/lower than the current market rather than biding(buy)/asking(sell) in the current market, the other party earns the price difference by hodling the contract until expiration day.
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:45:26
People can just buy/sell bitcoin in the current market without paying more / gaining less in the future market. Why do we need a future market for a/any non-commodity thing?
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:54:35
the buy/sell process is done the moment you trade future, with money moved from buyer to seller. What's left is collecting the btc you bought from the seller when the contract expires.

The most efficient miners today are:
ASICminer 8 Nano - 38Th/s - 1950W = 51.3J/TH
Antminer S9i - 14TH/s -  1320W = 94.3J/TH
If you don't have cheap electricity, mining should just be a hobby or a substitution for heating equipment in winter, rather than an investment. Cloud mining is just that some companies who want to transfer the risk of mining to others while locking profits for themselves. Buy bitcoin instead, especially when it's so cheap these days. The return is much bigger than mining in any way unless you got really cheap electricity.
