Users? I thought it was up to the miners.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:43:42
I noticed you posted it on BTC, it wasn't deleted by the mods... Those crazy mods letting you express your view.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:23:45
You should set it up so you can sign users in and have a top portfolios section a bit like prism.

Me too, it's a little bit frightening tbh
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:52:42
They don't, it's not really useable anymore. In its current state it's pretty pointless.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:49:50
Because it is now a useless coin... Sadly.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:01:12
Define a normal Bitcoin user please. Most normal Bitcoin users would be aware of the potential issues. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:03:04
Why would they.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:04:20
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:02:46
Then its their own stupid fault if they lose anything. Simple.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:05:39
Good on you, best of luck :)
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:01:57
I heard they're shitting down all exchanges!
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:53:46
Why would you hope that?
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:35:02
I cannot, hence the dip.
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:23:09
Yes, if miners wanted to get into traditional banking with high fees they should have done that. It's not the users concern how much the miners spent on their hardware, they get their rewards.
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:07:35
Good question
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:42:57
That is a sad fact. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:05:22
I think it was almost certainly due to the conference - altcoins / tokens pumping and you can only get most of them via BTC
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:45:04
That's called cornering the market... Satoshi wrote about it in the early days
@_date: 2017-05-17 06:26:07
Mind blowing response.

We disagree. Forks happen and are expected.
@_date: 2017-07-10 01:10:54
Keep doing what you're doing. I've appreciated the time you've spent appearing on the various podcasts explaining Prism - your enthusiasm is evident and gets me excited about what's to come. The prism concept is what crypto is screaming for and makes me bullish on ETH as a result. I'm looking forward to you integrating bitcoin into it but totally understand why you've stayed clear of it for now.
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:46:24
So what? ETH managed a successful hard fork.

I was in Boulder last October and the Spark one was out of order and no-one was really helpful with it at all.

I did it for a bit using the lending bot but then panicked when Polo started having real issues. Figured it was safer just to hodl on my own wallet and get returns from the price increases.
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:02:12
Really fucking fancy
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:09:12
Send it back to Coinbase, convert to fiat and withdraw
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:55:40
When you say get it out, do you mean send it to another address or return back to fiat?
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:00:45
If it's on Coinbase you don't have the private key, they do.
@_date: 2017-06-24 11:56:04
Oh, I don't argue with turnips sorry.
