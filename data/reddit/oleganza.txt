That's pretty much how virtually all Mac software before App Store worked (and still works for non-MAS binaries) - they use Sparkle auto-update library that bundles the verification pubkey in the vN to check the signature of the v(N+1) app upon download. No TLS or any CA trust hiearchies required.

Money's utility in providing its owner ability to be spend whenever they want, not only at the moment of spending.
@_date: 2015-12-07 16:18:23
I'll bite.
Transactions have inputs and outputs. Inputs reference other transactions' outputs and also contain authorization to spend them. This authorization is called "signature script" that contains a few bits of data with signatures matching public keys declared in the outputs.
Generally speaking, these signature scripts are called "witnesses" because they only demonstrate that tx is authorized by actual outputs' owners and do nothing more about it.
The idea is to move witnesses out of transaction hash and include in a separate tree of witnesses committed to the block. This is because mostly full nodes validating the entire blocks need this data, light clients may consume transactions with merkle paths without any witness data.
There are a few other nice things that it brings, but you are better off reading Pieter's and Greg's notes.

Mining is simply another way to invest in Bitcoin. Growing difficulty = growing competition on that market, just like growing price on gox = growing competition among buyers. Mining and buying are not really fungible.
Mining is more risky and requires more complex investment processes, but gives you clean coins in big amounts without pushing the price on exchanges.
Buying on exchanges is less risky technically, but moves the price because of low liquidity, so buying big amounts can be more expensive than mining.

Sure, but Bitcoin has a long way to become as expensive as gold. Even if each tx costs $100 to be mined, it will still be incredibly cheap compared to gold. However, most likely "crazy increase in fees" would simply mean $0.02 -&gt; $2 at most. It is a huge relative bump (100x), but on absolute scale still very inexpensive for a place in an impenetrable vault.

Not that it's rigged, but that it's not really gold. Fiat crrency crashes because someone is not honoring their liability. Paper gold is just the same kind of liability. Physical coins and bars, on the other hand, are many times less liquid than even BTC today, so only very big guys can afford moving gold. (Remember how Germany and France started withdrawing gold bars from NY Fed recently.)

If no one is building on Alice's block, that's the same as "block withholding attack", nothing new. It's equivalent to Alice keeping the block for herself while she mines the next one. Of course the risk is the same: some other miner may come up with a block that will be quickly validated by others.
I don't see a different attack scenario compared to sending full blocks. The scheme just takes less time for people to get full valid blocks (if they are valid). If the block is not fully loaded or not valid, that's exactly the same as today when your block is not downloaded completely or not valid.

"Electronic cash" does not magically imply that it's faster than paper cash for all use cases including casual shopping. Try shipping a suitcase of paper cash somewhere. Or try buying or selling a car with cash. Or look up how much it costs in terms of printing secure paper and suffering cost of counterfeited paper. All of these huge drawbacks of paper cash are less visible to you because you use electronic clearing houses (banking system). "Electronic cash" is surely better than paper cash in many senses, but it does not imply that you won't still need clearing houses for some use cases (such as paying for lattes, HFT etc).

The world is not static. If miners have low orphan rate by speculatively building on Alice's incomplete block, then all is fine. If Alice starts messing things up, miners would either speculate a very little amount of time (say, allowing 5 seconds to fetch all missing txs and then putting block aside) or none at all. Even in the worst case of not trusting anyone at all, miners are saving a lot of time compared to receiving full blocks. I really don't see how the scheme (apparently implemented by BlueMatt already) makes anything worse. I only see an improvement.

Informational content of this article is zero, or even negative, considering self-contradicting statements like "what's the incentive for me to do X, yet I do X in order to Y".
Today I heard a much better question asked on Twitter[1]: "why shouldn't holders also bear the cost of maintaining the network, why only actual transaction-makers do?"
At first sight, the answer is obvious: because transactions are having all the costs. If no one transacts, there is nothing to sync with, nothing to mine (assuming mining reward is negligible), no overhead, no one has to pay.
However, in reality, proof-of-work must always be increased in order to keep all balances respected[2]. So if you received some coins, you need a continuous flow of blocks on top of your unspent output to keep your coins safe from double-spending. Who is going to pay for that? Today that's every other transacting party, but not any of non-transacting holders (strictly speaking, holders provide liquidity which creates incentive to mine coins; but lets talk about mining reward approaching zero for the sake of discussion).
Is it fair or not? Well, the answer is difficult to grasp intuitively, but the gist is: if holding Bitcoin2 costs something, then it's equivalent to eternal inflation in favor of the miners. This would make Bitcoin2 less attractive investment than Bitcoin1, which promises absolute sovereignty of your money for decades to come. Which means, people would prefer holding Bitcoin1 to Bitcoin2 and, as a result, transact more in Bitcoin1 (because that's what other people want to receive). The beautiful part is that anyone who wants to ensure X blocks to be built on top of their unspent outputs have 100% voluntary options:
1. Mine these blocks themselves (like in 2009/10).
2. Pay miners to produce difficult enough blocks in form of tx fees with "pay-to-self" transactions or even have direct deals.
3. Pay miners with CLTV or CSV output (Peter Todd's idea, if i recall correctly). Imagine a transaction with one extra output with extra fees that gets spent only 100 blocks later. If it's CLTV, such output can be masked with P2SH so tx is not delayed unnecessarily (because CLTV is absolute and CSV is relative lock-time check).
So if the system will ever need subsidy from holders, that will be possible. But that will be voluntary, hence, your savings are 100% yours and you alone can decide how to sponsor the network, which makes Bitcoin the best money there is.

"Magna Carta originated as an unsuccessful attempt to achieve peace between royalist and rebel factions in 1215, as part of the events leading to the outbreak of the First Barons' War."

See Section 4 in my paper (
"3. Alice computes K = ... and public key T = ... Bob cannot know if his parameters were involved in K or T without the knowledge of a, b, c and d. Thus, Alice can safely publish T (e.g. in a Bitcoin transaction that locks funds with T)."
"T" is a public key to which you send funds. It is blinded from Bob because it is linearly transformed form Bob's public key using Alice's secret parameters.

I wonder if there's a simpler solution for block propagation than IBLTs (which are hard to code, test and understand for most developers). E.g. a list of 8-byte truncated transaction hashes. 20Mb block contains roughly 40K transactions (1 Mb block fits about 2K txs). If a miner (Alice) finds a solution, she only has to send 80 bytes of block header + 300 bytes of coinbase tx + 320Kb of transaction hashes. If a recipient (Bob) misses some transaction hashes, he will request them over existing connections from the same peer and all other peers (however, he most likely have already received all transactions that Alice knows about while she was mining). In case of (a very rare) collision in a 8-byte prefix for one or more transactions, Bob would iterate over all possibilities to reconstruct a matching merkle tree. Bob will only search for transactions not more than several blocks deep, so even if we have collisions days or weeks in the history, those won't matter.
As a result, most of the time the p2p network would have to relay 300-400Kb per new block. Occasionally a few transactions would have to be requested over existing connections, slightly increasing the delay. All mining nodes are motivated to propagate transactions they mine well upfront to make sure they make their own blocks accepted quickly and verify others' blocks quickly to switch to a new tip of the chain sooner.

"Identities are not used, and there's no reliance on recourse. It's all prevention."
@_date: 2015-06-04 09:19:28
Like in current Bitcoin Core and BlueMatt's Relay Node, miners should never trust the block before validating it fully. So 8-byte txhash is only used to locate the real transactions in local DB and reconstruct the merkle tree from them. If tx is missing, the block will wait till this tx is received from any node. If there is a collision, another tx will be tried to be used in a merkle tree to make sure it matched the block header. 
Only malicious activity here is to "mine" colliding transaction thus forcing people to spend extra CPU time to retry building merkle trees. But mining 8-byte collisions is currently equivalent to entire bitcoin hash power per 10 minutes. Would be much more interesting to just mine the block.

Constitution is ideologically opposite to Bitcoin. Bitcoin works without fancy declarations. Everyone who is not following the rules is softly ignored by others. Constitution requires a privileged violent group to "enforce" laws. And when you have such group to efficiently enforce any laws, why do you need laws at all? The enforcers are the real law, not some pieces of paper.
Like Stefan Molyneux said: "when you have rules, you don't need rulers; but when you have rulers, there are no rules." Chess players know the rules, they do not need a judge to know who won. However, figure skating has no real rules: only guidelines. The outcome is determined by a judge's opinion. "Checks and balances" in the government are distraction. It's just a power play between different groups who manipulate public's opinion.

Local city mall is also common and everyone is using it. It has clean airconditioned (!) roads with escalators (!). It's much nicer than govt-sponsored roads. Isn't it because people pay voluntarily for services of that mall? No one is dragging them there? You can just go for a walk and buy nothing and no one will kidnap you as a "free rider" and force you to fork off a half of your salary to pay for the air conditioning?
You make a logical mistake when you assume that the fact that something is commonly used by many people and is paid by the government proves that it's moral to force people to pay for it. Please show me a proof first before using state-owned goods as an argument for morality of violent coercion.
Last point: isn't it strange that on the market the price of a product almost never depends on how much you make, yet in govt everyone pays not proportionally to consumption, but proportionally to their income? If your theory of "govt is when people pay for common stuff" is correct, then why don't we all pay the fixed price for the same goods? If you start talking about social security, it's the same product, like any security. 
Heck, the government does not even exist. It's just a bunch of people doing certain things. It's just assumed by observers that some people can kill and others cannot. Some can carry a gun and other must be shot down if they try to. Etc. There's no logical proof anywhere. Every argument for logical existance and morality of govt institution opens another wave of unanswered questions. E.g. if you say "because democratical vote", you open another can of worms: who can vote, who can't, why people over here are not citizens and cannot vote. Why voting has any moral authority etc. etc. 
The truth is, people supporting violent coercion were obused through their entire life, got stockholm syndrom and do not want to reason about it. You do not want to dig really deep in the question of *why* *why* people believe in morality of religion, state, regulations, war etc. If you are really interested you wouldn't just fire cliches at me (like "go live in the forest"), you would be asking sincere questions to yourself and people around you. 
Government is the same religious belief as in Bible. Why people believe in Bible? "Because some time ago some wise old people wrote it". Same with constitution. However, reality does not work this way. Physics, biology, math, economics were the same 10000 years ago as they will be 10000 years in the future. The today's understanding may be flawed and can be improved, but the fact that people of the past held different opinions does not change neither the trajectory of the Earth, nor morality of slavery, nor laws of economics.

Sorry, I was only covering the technical issue they published in their PR. 
Regarding fiat operations, my opinion is this: anyone who regularly trades in Bitcoin is taking a lot more risk on himself and should be perfectly aware of it. Normal people should buy BTC in small portions, move BTC out of the exchange and never move them back in. Spend on something or keep under the mattress, but do not touch exchanges. If you really-really need to change coins for fiat, then do so in smaller portions on a working exchange. Otherwise, blame yourself.

If one wants to issue BTC receipts backed by BTC, then you have potentially fractional reserve where people exchange these BTC receipts. Why anyone would use them? E.g. for instantly confirmed micropayments. 
However, such payments by their very nature can be insured by a real BTC locked up in a multisig transaction and debts can be cleared without a problem on a daily basis. Unlike 19th century, where you'd have to physically move gold bricks across the ocean to clear the debts. This puts a big limit on amount of receipts that one can counterfeit.
So while fractional reserve in Bitcoin is 1) possible and 2) there is a use case where it may happen, FR will never be widely deployed simply because real BTC transaction is too darn cheap to do, so all debts will be kept relatively small and short in time.

No one asked for it, but for some reason you chose to say "I do think people should pay taxes". Considering that taxation is a violent coercion (well, like enforcing any other system of property rights), you said an equivalent of "I have an ethical theory that says submitting to taxation is good, evading taxation is bad and thus can be violently punished". In other words you displayed that you are willing to hurt many people you do not have any direct contact with on basis of a quite abstract theory ("taxation pays for some highly needed and very complex to measure and evaluate global tasks like planet-wide military, pension funds, child education, property rights enforcement etc").
Since you just advocated massive systemic violence in the name of several complex goals touching the lives of millions, I think we have the right to ask for a proof of your dangerous theory. Because if your theory is wrong, instead of being a good person you immediately turn into an evil one. That's a risk, so anyone willing to take it is better to have some rigorous proof before hurting people or advocating doing so.

Second part of the reason is that businesses work on a global market and thus need electronic money. Which is provided by state-controlled banks that do not allow tax evasion. So tax evasion is limited to small cash-based businesses that do not provide much income to the state anyway. But when every business is able to "optimize" their taxes by making more hidden bitcoin payments, then you'll see the full-scale effect.
Also: governments borrow from other governments this way or another or depend on USD directly or indirectly.

I was addressing your "warning". Bitcoin is in "land grab" mode right now. If it was easy for millions of people to evaluate it or if it was traded on major exchanges like NYSE, then it'd be like any stock: it'd move up on good expectations and down on bad. But Bitcoin is 1) hard to obtain 2) most people have no idea how to evaluate it (because it's just an abstract and weird new collectible, unlike stocks that represent real property). Since Bitcoin is so weird and unusual and can't be evaluated by millions, it makes it "risky" and worth a warning on its own, regardless of the price movements. But since those who study it see a huge multi-trillion-dollar worth potential, they occasionally form bubble-like rush to grab the coins. So the 30% movement is not without "discernible reason". Here's how it works:
0) For some reason media covers Bitcoin a lot. It started with article on Silk Road in 2011, but recently media was mostly driven by already started bubbles.
1) More new people now know about Bitcoin and begin studying it. If the price is stable or goes downwards they are not eager to invest. If the price is growing very fast, they are also not eager to buy in. They'll wait for a good moment and study how to safely store coins. 
2) Everyone who wanted to sell off after the last bubble or major "bad news" did so and there's already a critical mass of new people who were studying it hard and now ready to invest whenever price starts to go up.
3) When there are enough people in this "critical mass", some earliest risk takers make price move up visibly to invite next guys in. This naturally starts the snowball effect because there's a bunch of newcomers who spent some time and got ready to dive in.
4) Price moves faster which makes lesser risk takers among newcomers become more panicy or overly confident - they add to the bubble. 
5) New bubble invites more media attention and more newcomers, but those will not invest just yet. They will mostly invest after the crash or with the next bubble.
6) Everyone bought who wanted to buy and the price growth slows down. Experienced traders (rightfully) expect that some overly excited newcomers will panic and sell off, so they sell off first. This causes some amount of panic among later investing newcomers who sell at a lower price to the speculators. Price settles somewhere in the middle between the ATH and the starting price before bubble.
7) Media continues coverage inviting more people to invest, but since the price just crashed down and there are no people eager to buy just yet, almost no one is buying. People study it and wait for the next bubble. GOTO 1.
TLDR: Bitcoin is a "land grab". This explains all these patterns of bubbles and crashes.

I never said you should revolt against the law. Everyone has to play ball with armed people like everyone has to respect gravity. But it does not give a moral excuse to either of those and does not allow to shame people who try to revolt against these conditions nevertheless.

The problem with his prediction is not that "BTC will suddenly go ridiculously down", but with not explaining why it should go to $10 and not to $20 or $1. 
Consider this: if BTC legitimately appreciated to $10 point while still being held by very few people, then why can't the same process legitimately bring it to $100 or $1000? Mark Williams did not answer these questions. He just said that Bitcoin is stupid and thus overpriced. But he didn't explain why any other price is "correct".

No, I don't own what the state owns. I own what I control and I don't control what state owns. State may grant me some complicated rules to participate in decisionmaking, but I could do the same with my property for you. That still won't mean that you own any part of it. E.g. when you come to my house, I grant you ability to put any amount of sugar in your cup, but that sugar is not yours until you put it inside yourself.
Since you recommend me some books, let me do the same for you:

When you say "it's better to be somewhere between left and right", ask yourself what do you even mean by these words? What does it mean to be "left" or "right"? To me those are code words for slightly different sorts of coercion. If you are left, you prefer someone to mutilate your left hand, if your are right, you prefer that your right hand is cut off instead. How about a novel idea: everyone is free to hold any opinion, but instead of a violent intervention, they try to solve problems peacefully. And to start doing it we have to understand that government is not an institution of peace, quite the contrary. 
 
But that doesn't matter. Because things like bitcoin, bitmessage, bittorrent make coercion way too expensive. So people do what the heck they want and you can't stop them. Theoretically you can, but in practice it's too damn expensive.  
So in a novel thing like bitmarkets where people communicate privately, have 2-of-2 multisig escrow and there's no intermediary, you opinion does not matter. If two folks want to do business, they will and you will never even know that they did. When everyone uses bitcoin, governments wouldn't be able to declare "budget deficit" and print debt-based money to pay their expenses. Since it's so easy to avoid taxation, every additional tax evader will defund the state and make it safer for another guy to not pay for the racket. Then the state disappears due to economical factors, no matter what your philosophy is about. The world is still not black and white, but without a sustainable institution of violence. People will have to solve their disputes differently and, more importantly, locally. If you dislike me it won't be a problem for millions of taxpayers. It'll be only our very little local problem.

Here's a suggestion: when I pay for something on the internet, tell my wallet order ID/URL to associate with the transaction. This probably can be done over BIP70 payment request. Then, my wallet will show richer details on my shopping and also will allow to sign in with the key used to pay for that order (so I can track it's status, change delivery address, cancel etc.) We only need to have a wallet that will hold this metadata to make user experience nice: with a single "view your order" button next to the transaction.
The benefit is that website will not ask for *any* identification upfront - only for the payment. Then I can prove it's really me by using the same key I used to pay them.

Fiat is not backed by gold since many years ago. Even when it was, FRB made sure for any average Joe that he won't see any gold. In fact, gold was confiscated in the most democratic country in the world in exchange of some fiat in 1933 under threat of 10 year imprisonment.  
Also: the gold being physical and very heavy is what led humanity to powerful cartel of banks, fractional reserve and current fiat system in the first place. You just have to store gold in someone's warehouse to do international trade. Without "digital money" which existed in form of paper IOUs in 19th century, international trade wouldn't be possible.
Bitcoin takes good from both worlds: mobility of IOUs with "hard ownership" of the gold. You have your shiny collectible which you can send through a wire, so you don't need to stack all of it in a single warehouse. And even if you do for some reason (like in Coinbase), then you still have an option to withdraw it all whenever you want at no cost. With gold bars - not so much.

The basic principle is the same as with NashX, with several implementation differences:
1. NashX allows destroying money, which puts extra pressure on people to keep behaving nice. Bitmarkets simply keeps money locked until both agree to unlock.
2. NashX is a web app that makes the tx for you, it does not have a wallet functionality for the user to sign tx on his own device. Bitmarkets implements a wallet (SPV with BitcoinJ) and does not rely on third party to make the multi-party transaction. Its protocol allows interactive signing: you sign your half, send tx to other party, they sign their half. Then tx is valid.
3. NashX charges fee. Bitmarkets does not have anyone between you and merchant.

Bitcoin is first of all an asset. The more marketable/liquid it is, the more useful it is. The more useful the blockchain is for non-monetary purposes too. Liquidity is simply a number of hands holding BTC. More hands, more coins being demanded =&gt; higher liquidity. As an effect, the price is higher too (because supply is constrained). Hence, you think "they are just pumping". But the fact is, Bitcoin's usefulness to anyone depends directly on number of holders, that's it.

Before the age of fiat there was enormous relative growth across the world during industrial revolution. Instead of 10 big cities we got thousands of them around the world. Before industrial revolution, banking did not exist or was not accessible to many people. People had physical gold (easy to extract) and lived in highly hierarchical society.
Today we accept many civil liberties for granted which limits the state. It cannot just drag anyone to prison. Money extraction must be invisible. Bitcoin protects exactly against that, forcing the state to be more explicit (which is quickly punished by public negative perception).
Private property can be enforced locally, without the need for millions to involuntary pay for a nation-wide law-enforcement institute. Type of protection depends on type of property. There's no single answer and it's up for market to find various solutions. What's important, market can't try different solutions if there's constant threat of state's intervention that overrules everyone.

"Transaction ID" is a misleading name. What we all mean is "transaction hash". Transaction "spends" coins from previous transactions by referencing them by their hashes. When the previous transaction is already in the blockchain, it can't be changed even slightly, so its hash is permanently valid. But when transaction is unconfirmed, its hash has no meaning as someone may change the transaction a little, get it in the chain and from that point it will be identified by a different hash.

Gold and silver can be "manipulated" only because you can trade gold that is sitting in manipulator's vault and you cannot move that gold in and out quickly enough to other exchanges for arbitrage.
When the price is higher than you think is correct, you can move in BTC very quickly, sell it and make profit. When the price is lower than you think is correct, you can buy more and move it out. 
The remaining problem is that moving USD in/out is much slower than BTC, but it's still much faster and cheaper than transporting physical gold.

Ponzi scheme is a promise of dividends from a supposed productive activity. Bitcoin does not give any dividends. If you want to "make money", it'll be just like with any other asset: you have to sell it. And once you sell, you lose the opportunity to make even bigger gain (if price rises) or make less gain (if price goes down). 
Investing in Bitcoin is not like investing in stock, but like investing in a commodity: gold, oil etc. It cannot be a Ponzi scheme even if Satoshi was selling pre-mined coins himself.

1. It's not a "pre-mine" because everyone was able to participate freely from day one and even if you were 1 month late, Satoshi didn't have all 900K coins by the end of first month.
2. It's equally not a ponzi/pyramid/stock as there are no dividends to be paid by anyone. The only gain you may have is by selling higher. But once you do, you don't have those coins anymore. It's a pure collectible.
3. If Satoshi wanted to cash out his coins, it'd be stupid to do it in the open market for reasons of low liquidity and no privacy.
4. Even if he moved the price by selling some coins, so what? It'd lower the price, but would also lower amount of his stash, reducing this "risk" for every new investors. Those who worry about Satoshi's coins are sitting in fiat. As he starts to sell them, that risk will get lower and marginal non-investors will go in and pick up his coins. In the end there will be some equilibrium: the more Satoshi sells, the more people are feeling less worried about his coins and willing to invest themselves.

"Econ 101: Marginal Cost = Marginal Revenue"
This is such a bullshit. All economic activity is driven by profit (measurable or psychic). Profit being (revenue – cost). The bigger profit, more people are going into the market, more happen to be comfortable with higher costs, which eventually brings profit to some world-average value. This value cannot be zero (no one will work for zero profit). This value is marginally bigger for remaining participants than a profit in any other field where they can re-allocate their capital, hands and brains.
Of course, the world is never stable, so while profits are being squeezed in one market, someone figures out new demand in some other and entrepreneurs rush there.

Bitcoin world means that everyone stores money and transacts in Bitcoin. This might eventually happen due to natural tendency to a single universal money (because of opportunity cost/maximum liquidity requirement). Due to currency controls states make it hard to converge on a single fiat currency, but Bitcoin bypasses such controls. And as it displays growing (not shrinking) purchasing power, lower ownership costs etc, people will be eager to get it. It's theoretically possible to have state and all taxes in a Bitcoin world. State only won't be able to print money and wage expensive wars and other debt-funded projects.


I expect the state to get reduced to a point where those are simply not enforced anymore because no one believes in or needs state anymore, and market has enough power to provide protection against racket. Your final question is about how this didn't happen before:


The difference is that amount of productivity and civil liberties now and then is different. People were less educated, less connected. There was different standard of violence. First world had slaves locally or in form of colonies (where there was much more violence). Many people were not living for generations in nice cities, but were running from 18-hour workdays at the farm to 15-hour workdays in more prosperous cities. Productivity was growing faster than the growth of the state, so few people were too much concerned. In 20th century too: computers improved productivity thousand times and allowed the states grow to global proportions. If we invent another high-productivity tech that coexists with the state, we won't need to get rid of it for another 50 years. But today the states grow a bit too great and threaten the entire global economy, so they must shrink. As they do, markets will efficiently solve all the problems that states solve now and make it more and more irrelevant. We now can communicate cheaply and directly to solve social problems without tons of intermediaries. In 19th century we couldn't.
Btw, what does it mean to be a "social libertarian"?

As I said elsewhere. There's a distribution of tax payers/evaders: from hardcore evaders, to marginal evaders, to marginal payers, to hardcore patriotic payers. In btc-only world state can only exist on taxes which it pays to its agents to enforce the laws and extract more taxes. Now, if state runs short of money (it always does due to inefficiency and the fact that only 10% or less of taxes pays the actual cops and soldiers), it has less forces to extract taxes. Therefore, additional marginal tax payers become marginal evaders (because it's safer now). Once they didn't pay their share, state loses a bit more power and makes it safer to evade taxes for the next guy. And so on. At some point hardcore payers will find out that all cops quit their jobs (no one pays them enough) and there's no one to take their taxes.
Also, as state gets funded less, free market becomes more wealthy and can pay higher salaries. This makes people to quit their government jobs and go to work on the market. Which again makes state less powerful and less legitimate in the eyes of the people. Ultimately, many services that state "provides" can be done by a new powerful market making people ask themselves why they even need the state.

Yeah, everyone is at fault. If you really learned about Bitcoin enough to invest, you would have known that Bitcoin solves "counterparty risk" problem which means several things: 
1. There's a HUGE international banking "counterparty risk" built-in that caused massive inflations worldwide and non-stop wars.
2. Legal system is a joke: it does not protect citizens against the elites, but rather the other way around.  is how that system is financed and maintained over such a long period of time.
3. Since legal system works against you and you are investing in a workaround at that system, you are on a VERY DANGEROUS road. 
4. As a corollary, legal system will not protect anyone who is hurt by counterparties like Gox when dealing with anti-system investment like Bitcoin.
5. Imagining that people will unite around BTC and it will survive any attack is a very long bet. It's a risky and long bet. If you were lucky to make a quick return over 2013 - that's pure luck. The risks and longevity of the bet are still the same.
6. Since you are going around legal system and counterparty risk, you ARE ON YOUR OWN. If you have virus - you lose, if you forget your passphrase - you lose. If your computer is stolen or lost - you lose. You accept all these risks.
7. There are no fancy safe and easy to use wallets and vaults yet. They have to be developed, but if you yourself is not a developer, you just wait till others develop those (or pay them).
If you blame anyone except yourself after all this it means only one thing: you didn't do your homework. You have to blame yourself.
Now, if you need cash today, sell portion of BTC today no matter what the price. Own your mistakes and your loss. If you don't need cash today, relax, do your homework and sell later. Or much-much later.

Average prices are stupid. Lets see:
Exchange A has buy price of 450 USD/BTC and sell price of 449 USD/BTC. 
Exchange B has buy price of 460 USD/BTC and sell price of 459 USD/BTC.
If you show an average which is 455 USD/BTC, it will not correspond to any exchange at all. I will not be able to neither buy, nor sell at 455 anywhere. It'll be either too high or too low.
In practice only real prices matter. 
If you are a trader on 3 exchanges, you only need real prices and order books on these 3 exchanges. You don't care about 4th exchange.
If you are a merchant/consumer in Europe and buy/sell coins on Bitcoin-Central, you do not care about Bitstamp price. You only care about EUR order book on Bitcoin-Central.

Both parties can lock up 200% of the amount in question in a 2-of-2 multisig transaction and unlock upon completion of their business. This deposit creates a Nash equilibrium situation: every party has something more at stake then a potential profit from fraud.
E.g. I sell you an iPod for $100. We both lock $200 each in an atomic 2-of-2 multisig script. I send you the iPod. Now you have the iPod that costs $100, but you have $200 locked up. It makes sense to you to unlock the money so that you get $100 back and I get $300 (mine $200 + yours $100).

My take on this: 
Right now nodes do not accept double spending transactions, no matter how much they pay in mining fees. This makes simple security promise for 0-conf transactions: the most relayed version is the one that most probably will be included in the block. So merchants can accept such transactions because they know that reversing it would cost much more than 100% of the transaction value.
If enough nodes on the network replace transactions when the mining fee is, say, 10% higher than the previous version (or 10% of the total amount, or whatever), then for the user it is much cheaper to “take money back”. You will send $5 for your coffee and get back $4 with no sweat. Merchant will lose all $5. You can say goodbye to 0-confirmation transactions.
So what do we have:
1) Users get some sort of “undo” function which is nobody was asking for. In my view, if there’s a problem with accidental button clicking in the UI, it’s simpler to fix right there, not by changing the entire network.
2) No one can rely on 0-confirmation transactions anymore. Even today they are not safe, but for small purchases the risks are pretty low, so they work for many people to everyone’s satisfaction. But with network-wide “replace with higher-fee transaction” the risk will go up significantly to make this feature unusable.
However, in the long run, 0-conf transactions won’t be the future of instant micropayments (we’ll have some sort of distributed clearing network instead), so we might not care that much. But the value of “undo” is still very questionable to throw away usefulness of 0-conf transactions today.
Final note: Bitundo can’t be useful when it’s small. It’s either working more than 90% of the time for legitimate “undos” (which makes 0-conf txs useless) or it’s used marginally only by those who wish to rob merchants who accept 0-conf transactions. In which case they still may render 0-conf transactions useless.

Since government is the agency demanding monopoly on violence, guns, armies, protecting kids, poor, old persons, solving global environmental problems and teaching everyone morality and that "if you are good, you have nothing to hide" and that "we need to know everything about everyone to catch bad guys", government is *by definition* is the biggest risk to privacy, security and well-being of any single individual. Those who like the idea of government must understand this: even if your government is benevolent, it still is a huge risk point because its "service" is provided by giving it freedom to affect your life in many ways.
Now you have a philosophical choice: either you take the risk and give all power in the world to a supposedly benevolent group of Platonic experts in all matters in life, or you build tools to protect individuals against any single powerful group, benevolent or not.
If you choose first, you don't need Bitcoin. You can just vote with your neighbors on the board of monetary experts that will make you whatever money they think is best for you. 
If you choose second, then government is the adversary number 1 against which the technology is protecting its users. Regardless of whether you view govt a benevolent or malicious entity: it has power which can be used against the will of the users of Bitcoin.
So it's absolutely natural that any pro-Bitcoin, pro-Tor, pro-Bittorrent etc discussion is inherently and primarily anti-government. And it has nothing to do with the govt being good or bad. It's about leverage and power, not about morality.

I believe I've answered this already above. States have control on money flows. Modern economy needs digital money to function efficiently. Only few and very local business can work with paper cash. Everyone else to be productive needs banking. Banking means total control and "soft" enforcement. If one guy does not pay his share, he is quickly identified and punished before everyone else can follow him. This way people have an illusion of non-violent tax collection. E.g. if it was easy to identify and quickly punish anyone who downloads a movie from bittorrent, most people would never dare to even install it.
However, if you have alternative digital money that can't easily be monitored, people have choice: those who can (partially or fully) opt-out from banking system and go with bitcoin now have a context-specific option to evade taxation. So they are still productive, but now their accounts can't be seized, frozen or sometimes even detected. 
Most important point: even if businesses are all paying taxes in Bitcoin world, when the government runs out of money, it cannot simply force them to fork off additional money. E.g. they can't start a prosecution and seize funds immediately because funds are not seizable. If some businesses fall out of favor they can't be instantly milked to re-fill the government. And since government can't instantly get money to pay the salaries, people start run away from it and the whole scheme slowly falls apart.

You and me may have our taxes deduced automatically, but there are millions of people who are doing job in cash and avoid taxes. In UK, Russia or anywhere else. Every local restaurant does not declare 10% of their earning. Tips are not declared as income. Most bitcoin transactions are not declared too ;-)
What's important is the dynamic: how every marginal non-evader becomes an evader once previous evaders make state earn less. Every penny that is not given acts against the state: it cannot borrow or print money, so it can pay less to less people to enforce its own existence. Eventually there won't be a tax collector paid by the state who monitors your paycheck and you can simply switch to Bitcoin and declare nothing to anyone.
That's similar to bittorrents. It's quite expensive and intrusive to fight individual moms, pops and kids who pirate music and movies, so everyone feels safe to do that. Even if otherwise they pay their taxes and respect other laws.

Nick Szabo wrote on early collectibles and makes a case that they were used and valued even before barter economy was deemed impractical. 
TLDR: to enable delayed reciprocity one needs some collectible token which must be scarce, portable and divisible. Those who own that collectible can enjoy exchanging them at whatever value they agree on. If it works for them, other might be interested in joining and therefore bigger value and greater liquidity is formed.

There are millions of charitable ways that people help other people. Families, non-profit organization, for-profit organizations help a lot. Absence or existence of the state has nothing to do with people being charitable. I'd say, without the state, people would have more disposable income to donate voluntarily and enthusiastically where they think is appropriate. Also, as everything, charity by government is far from being very efficient and a lot of funds go to bureaucrats.
Then, since we both agree that there are crazy destructive people, why do you think they won't stick to such juicy organizations like military and police where they can unleash their craziness and even being paid for it? If you want to be a cop, you must be willing to hit and shoot people. More peaceful folks do not go to police department.
The fact that some people are dangerous is only argument against the state, not for it. Because the state is not made up of some ideal human beings from another planet.
Also: if you are not being paid for being a crazy lunatic (a soldier), then you pay for each act of violence (by wasting your time not earning money and taking risk of being injured or killed). So the more violence you attempt, the costlier it is for you and quicker you will run out of motivation (or blood). However, if you work as a soldier, every act of violence is regularly compensated by awards, paycheck and bonuses. Heck, even if you are injured, there's a huge juicy insurance for you. Government hugely motivates violent behavior in those who want to be violent.

Apple earns 30% of all app purchases. There are also 70% that developers earn. And users pay all 100%. In context of payment systems, it's important how much money smartphone users spend, not how many of them happen to have a particular OS installed. All iPhones are high-quality expensive computers and most users have Apple ID with a credit card connected, while many Android phones are cheap replacements for classic cellphones where people are not going to waste any more money for anything. I mean to say that not everyone has nice and expensive 5-inch Samsung Galaxy phone. Most have something much cheaper and simpler.

If your phone is compromised as badly as someone hijacks the UI of the wallet app, you are screwed. But you'll typically lock money in smaller batches (e.g. 10 times 10% of your money), so you'll notice the compromise by losing only 10%.

The attack is not new. Many wallets are using random signatures and sometimes become victims of flawed RNGs. The attack is not "deadly" because vulnerability is decentralized. Only those with faulty RNGs are at risk, not everyone and everywhere. E.g. when in August 2013 Android wallets used faulty RNG not every single user was affected, but only those who updated to the buggy Android version.
My library for Objective-C CoreBitcoin makes deterministic ECDSA signatures (very similar to RFC6979) and powers three wallets on the App Store (bitWallet, BitStore, Yallet).

I was not saying that people will all have to "hide" all their property.
What I said is a dynamic process: some people are more eager to hide money, others are less eager. But since in BTC economy state can only survive on taxation, every extra penny not given to the state makes it weaker. And since on each step state gets weaker, one more penny is easier to hide. Every tax evader makes it safer for the next guy to become tax evader. And this spirals to full dissolution of the state unless cops would go and try to tax everyone directly. Which would be ridiculous and people would not justify that at all in any way.

You seem not to understand what's the purpose of money. The purpose of money is to sit in your pocket and be spendable, not be spent (once spent, it's not yours and now it fulfills its function for someone else). The better money fitting this purpose is the one that is desired by more people (global bubble or total collapse follow from here). The more people want to hold scarce money, the more useful it is for every single one of them and therefore higher the market price. Therefore, price is a direct indicator of usefulness of the money (on a big free market). Q.E.D. 
Since Bitcoin market is not entirely free (it's hard to sell or buy coins) and quite small, it's more volatile on a daily basis, but longer-term everything equals out by speculators and arbiters. 
Here's a good quote as a starter: 
Regarding txs: txs are merely effects of several factors, one being number of holders. Another factor could be costs of payments (which is orthogonal to Bitcoin's "global bank ledger" purpose). If Bitcoin allows cheaper payments than methods X, Y and Z, then you'll see more and smaller-value txs. If some clearing network (e.g. Visa) is still cheaper/faster, then you'll have less and higher-value txs on Bitcoin. I view Bitcoin purpose first and frontmost as a global ledger of civilization (competing with central banks and gold), not as a "payment network" to compete with other clearing houses like Visa, PayPal, wire transfers etc. Why? Because if Bitcoin fails at being safe and global ledger, its payment capabilities mean zero. But if it succeeds, then it does not matter what sorts of payment networks are built on top of it. Heck, even 1 MB block will be enough for decades. You coffee purchase does not need a global consensus. Only savings and big sums need to be secured there. Think of it as a 99/1 rule: 99% money sits and uses only 1% of txs to be moved. While 99% of txs move just 1% of cash.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:30:40
Tx hash ("tx ID") is useful only when tx is already included in the blockchain. Then it can't be tampered with and is used by new transactions when they spend existing ones.
Businesses issue unique payment addresses and watch them. They cannot issue transactions for customers, so that's issue is irrelevant to them. It's relevant to intermediaries who act as a wallet. E.g. exchanges. MtGox was sending money on behalf of the user and had to check if it went through or not. They were checking that incorrectly. If the user's wallet was doing a check like MtGox, they'd too were fooled to think that they didn't pay and maybe they'd try again. Thankfully, wallets (full nodes or not) are checking addresses, not any specific tx hashes.
@_date: 2014-02-11 15:57:20
It is dangerous to spend unconfirmed change outputs even if transactions were not malleable. If you are sending me money from a confirmed output with a decent fee, I can take some risk and assume it will get validated in some decent period of time and the chance of it being double-spent is quite low. But if you are sending me a transaction on top of another unconfirmed transaction, then my risks are being multiplied: now I have to evaluate the risk of the initial transaction being double-spent or included with a significant delay. At very best, I will get my money 2x slower than from the confirmed output. 
Whether I accept only confirmed transactions, or "good" unconfirmed ones, for the wallet user it'll be a huge risk and pain in the ass if his software creates such an unconfirmed chain.

You can invest in gold and if it loses value because no one wants it, there are no other tangible assets for you to redeem, only this devalued commodity.

Bitcoin is still useful even if most of the users are monitored in the same way their credit card payments are monitored. They don't lose anything in terms of privacy compared to current banking and CC, but they gain deflationary currency (good for savings) and better control over ownership (against arbitrary "haircuts" and better for tax evasion). If this does not kill, but rather help mainstream Bitcoin adoption, then this will happen: everyone will eventually will rush to dump USD for BTC. Most governments are insolvent now and their taxes won't be enough to sponsor wars, national programs, NSA, DEA, FBI and CIA. When everyone runs for BTC, govt will not be able to pay in BTC to all its employees (because they can't print it and can't tax efficiently to cover all their expenses). Therefore only limited local governments may potentially survive. But then there won't be any global centralized surveillance system and you may have your privacy back.

Regarding blackmail/extortion, it's limited when both parties are anonymous or have little knowledge about personality of another person. If I try to play dirty with you, how do I know that you are in a desperate position and will submit? Maybe you will turn out a better player in this poker? Or maybe you will simply send me a message "no, please pay as we agreed initially, period" and we won't be able to discuss this longer.
This nash eq. approach is particularly great for automated agents. E.g. two apps paying each other for measurable service and owners of both apps know perfectly well how another app will behave - there's no one to extort. Either you follow the contract, or you don't. So you can troll someone by simply losing your own funds, all alone in a sad silence.

Hazard means presence of risk. It does not mean that bad things "necessarily happen", it means they "may happen". Every TTP is hazardous, but not every one of them actually fucks you over (for different reasons).
When the anarchists propose TTP to solve some problems they always have to explain who to limit the hazard. E.g. "competition will weed out bad players" or "there will be reputation and rating agencies". Statists do it too: "I have to trust food in this supermarket, it's hazardous, but in case they poison me, someone will go to jail - therefore hazard is somehow limited".
If I misuse the word "hazard", simply replace it everywhere by "risk of breaking the trust".
Next, about purchasing power: granted, it's not stable today, but people invest in it because they bet that their purchasing power will be much greater in some long enough timeframe (&gt;1 year maybe). Those who study how Bitcoin evolves may decide to invest and not worry about immediate gratification. Another crowd moves the price up which increases overall interest among other consumers and developers and invites the next crowd. Cycle repeats.
Sure, that's is speculative. If someday everyone drops bitcoin and goes home, it'll be worthless. I cannot prove that people will never do that. So my fundamental assumption is that the current trend of quickly growing adoption and infrastructure improvements will continue until everyone has bitcoins. I back this assumption by the network effect (existing trend makes more people interested in continuing it) and by inner qualities of bitcoin (ease of bypassing financial controls, lower fees etc.)

Good point. The idea that the government ultimately collapses is based on incentives, but those may not kick in for thousands of years. That's everyone's personal bet on when exactly that may happen or if it may happen at all. That's why I do not try to prove any timeframe. 
At the same time, church exists in many ways thanks to the governments. People are still educated in govt schools to believe in higher moral authorities and therefore believe all sorts of religions or superstitions. State is religion in this way and it is still, as 200 years ago, fueled by violent extraction of funds. So I wouldn't use church as an example of a completely separate entity that exists even though people are more educated. The problem is that state prevents people from being sufficiently educated in terms of morality and constantly pays for violence and obedience.

That's why it's 5-of-10, not 10-of-10 (in case someone refuses, dies, not available etc). And your friends only provide authentication to you, they never see the contents of the transaction.
Also consider that friends would be using the same or compatible wallet software, so they'd be locking up *their* funds with you and their friends in the same manner. So it is expected to be a mutual authentication, without anyone trying to extort anyone.
Last point: friends will not be able to figure who are the other of your friends. I may lock funds with my friends in Paris, San Francisco, St. Petersburg and my family members. Even if it's possible for them to gather majority against me it only means that I deserved their hate.

It can be stolen from an individual, but cannot easily be stolen from millions of individuals. Right now when all transactions are flowing through central hubs like banks, paypal etc, it's easy to tax everyone. Also, it's extremely easy to tax just by printing more money via Fed. You do not have to arm thousands of cops to go and knock on every door to extract cash from people. In fact, if you try that, those cops will quickly join the revolutionary crowd that will hang you.
So bitcoin can be stolen from individuals by individuals, but cannot be systematically and latently stolen to fund some questionable expensive activities like wars. If one wants the war in bitcoin world, they'd have to knock on everyone's door and collect as much as people will be okay to give.

I think the spectrum from "voluntarism" to "violent coercion" maps to amount of choices one has. The more choices to avoid undesirable interaction, the more "voluntarism" is here. E.g. when your girlfriend is upset and "makes you" to do something, it's a coercion in some sense, but nothing threatens your life and you can ultimately walk away (even if it'd be quite painful).
So lets imagine a local community of apartment owners in a single building. The building is shared and everyone has to deal with everyone's opinion. That limits your personal freedoms, but at least no one is killing you and you can potentially change apartment or agree to different terms in the first place. Or you could rent and apartment and make someone else to have these problems. Or leave in a separate house. You have more choices. So you could call your committee a "government", but it is ridiculously focused and limited in power.

Yes, but the original "fractional reserve" is exactly the same and works partly due to people confusing "promise" with the real thing. In the beginning it was a paper dollar (promise) vs gold/silver. Yet, since the dollar in itself became a good portable money substitute, and since it had fancy brand and taxes were collected in it (therefore accountants were better off keeping books in dollars, not grams or ounces of metal), people were just assuming dollars *the money*.
Now, when everyone went off the gold standard, fractional reserve changed its form: now you have M0 which is *the money* and then you have M1 and M2 etc which are "promises to pay M0 money" but since all of this money are called the same and for a normal person are indistinguishable (all of them are sitting in the accounts with the same "$" sign), it's now even harder to separate promises from the money. Actually, it was designed to be this way.
Bitcoin receipts are no different in the theoretical context where they are useful. E.g. in a micropayments clearing system. In the UI you will see prices in BTC, you will see balance in BTC, but those BTC are not yet real BTC until debts are cleared by real bitcoin transaction. No one in their right mind would design the system to call them BTCR or "BTC-Promise". People would not accept that kind of user interface. So there's again a potential for a fractional reserve just like with paper dollar/silver coin in 19 century or M0/M1 fiat dollar in 20th.

The vast majority of people have no power. They vote for whatever state gives them because it's risk-free for them. Things are not being changed by those who have nothing and risk nothing. Only people with something to lose have real reason and real voice to push civilization.
Example: 80% may cheer for the war, but only as long as it is paid by "someone else" (of course, indirectly by themselves too to some degree). If they are facing a situation when they themselves have to sponsor the war and whatever the state is doing, they might adjust their views.
People are greedy and poor people who depend on the state are very greedy. When they have an opportunity to make more money by not working for the state, or cut the expenses by not paying taxes that are easy to bypass (example: movie torrents - no one catches people, so many people pirate them without a problem).
My argument is that status quo is mostly "supported" by those who are afraid and who have no alternative. That's not real "support", that's just stockholm syndrom and means nothing. No one will go and die for a right to pay taxes.

GPL means "if you use this in your project you must opensource it and do it under GPL-compatible license".
LGPL means "same as GPL, except you do not need to opensource code that links with the GPL binary; you only need to publish the source for the binary".
LGPL seems to be much less limiting, but it has a hazard of some nitpicking FSF lawyers coming in and saying that you didn't link in a strict sense. Or, for instance, you don't want to link, but just want to throw a bunch of source files in your directory for whatever reason. You cannot do that without enforcing GPL for all the rest of the code.
GPL is uncomfortable not only to commercial closed-source vendors, but also to people who to give source code with real freedom, like MIT/BSD/WTFPL licenses. If I use GPL code in my library, I can no longer release it under WTFPL, I have to release it under GPL and force it upon users of my code.

That's your bet. Mine is that incentives are correct anyway. I never mined anything and I don't care even if ghash has 90% of hashpower. They will lose all users instantly if they try some tricks. Bitcoin will be alright as long as there are at least some honest miners. After all, miners do not have to choose to mine on top of the most difficult chain and can do mayhem at will. It's all based on human behavior and incentives, not magic algorithms.

Incentives matter. You never can control how many people are competing with you. But if all of you have incentives to play by the rules, then you are alright. Every miner has a choice: play by the rules and have a nice reward or try to doublespend someone at risk of wasting time and money.

Ok, in my article I have two parts: 1) why it's invalid to believe in usefulness of the state *and* the usefulness of bitcoin at the same time. 2) why it will happen so that the state will eventually dissolve.
First part:
- Fiat currency requires TTP (trusted third parties) to function. 
- Bitcoin does not require TTP and no one can become a TTP and dictate the rules.
- Financial TTP are hazardous: they can take over the entire economy. If that was not the case, no one would be against the existing currency.
- Therefore, investing in Bitcoin is acknowledging the hazard of TTPs and making a bet that Bitcoin protects against such hazards. In other words, costs of using Bitcoin are lower than losses from trusting TTPs.
- On the other hand, believing in the usefulness of the state is believing in TTPs to decide different aspects of life. Like with finance, they are also hazardous. 
- The logical incompatibility follows from this: a person acknowledges general hazard of powerful TTP in case of finances and is willing to strip them away with Bitcoin, yet he thinks that in other areas of life those hazards are tolerable or non-existant. While in fact, hazards of TTPs are not specific to the realm of TTP, but the fact that TTP has power and must be trusted with that power.
Second part:
- Bitcoin bypasses currency controls and provides better purchasing power.
- This forces more and more people to invest in it.
- Which in turn creates a feedback loop, increasing purchasing power and inviting more people in, legitimizing the whole platform and inviting more development in it to make it easier, safer, etc.
- By trying to confiscate bank accounts, print money, impose currency controls, governments only make the process faster as people generally want to use money as they see fit and if it's made more complex, they are more likely to switch to bitcoin.
- Ultimately, with or without excessive printing, fiat currency faces hyperinflation - people run from it to exchange the remaining dollars and pesos into bitcoins. Fiat is demonetized, bitcoin becomes fully monetized (almost everyone has it, at least within some economic region).
- Now millions of people have a currency different from paper notes and bank accounts: it's easier to protect against looters, it's more private and it flies over the wire. Government regulations still exist and still apply to businesses and visible activity, but the black market and private small businesses have a much freer money.
- Businesses still pay taxes and report all earnings, but now it's not possible to extract extra cash from them by threats of seizure. Businesses may be forced to shut down, but their cash is much harder to seize. 
- Government must exist only on taxation and must do so efficiently. It cannot simply come and take money from some "bad guys" by freezing their "account" if they need extra cash tomorrow.
Now there are several factors that kick in at the same time:
- International businesses already employ complex schemes to minimize their taxation and some are so powerful that they partially control the government. For those it will become easier to set up more private channels to move cash around. No need to be friends with many intermediaries that participate in monetary flows. This eats from the tax base.
- At the same time, another generation of people makes more and more transactions without paying government a penny. Black market will grow because it can. Also, a lot of work is intellectual nowadays and all sorts of freelancers will hugely underreport their earnings. It will become more profitable to be a freelancing individual that to work in a cubicle doing the same thing for less money and liberties.
- And since we don't have inflation, suddenly many more people have real savings. People are more protected against unknown troubles in the future, they need less of a nanny-state to give them free goodies. Less dependency and belief in institutional care. 
- More wealth on the market means more and better voluntary alternatives to the state's services. If state fails to repair a road, people wouldn't need to vote and wait till another governor fixes it. They will have spare cash to just go and fix it. Things like Uber/Airbnb that disrupt artificial monopolies will be so superior and cheaper, and stealthier (if needed) that legitimacy of these monopolies will no longer hold any ground. 
Allowing people to save and reinvest money will make the market produce better stuff and outperform state in many ways making people believe in it much less. Slowly growing tax evasion pressure from both big corporations and local markets will make the state less and less funded which would make it to become less and less competitive and more desperate for money.
Ultimately, people will quit state jobs for something more profitable on the market. People will less care about state-provided services as they can have a better alternative without it. General belief that taxation helps anyone will start to fade away (because taxation, after all, is not something everyone really enjoys). 
As state needs money, it might be willing to completely sell its land to a private enterprise on more liberal terms than before. E.g. some people could invest a lot in a new city under condition that the legacy state grants it a huge autonomy. But within the city there will no longer be the same taxation (in order to attract people in it). If the state sells but then changes its mind and attacks this city, people will not see it as a legitimate attack and will fund a protection guard that may even destroy the rest of the state. While the old state is selling off its powers and consumes its budget, there is no agency that gets those powers. Ultimately, people will buy themselves out of the state one piece of land at a time. Sort of like slaves could buy themselves full freedom from their owners.
Is it more logical?

Euros are not much different from USD. If they were, everyone would jump on euros already.
Gold is precisely what has led us to current fiat currencies. Gold has weight, but the trade is global and digital (since before computers were invented!). Therefore we need to store gold in warehouses and use banking system to exchange IOUs. Ultimately, all the gold is being held by the biggest vaults who create the Fed and print as much IOUs as they want. Gold is not a solution because it's the reason for modern financial failures. More on that: 
Only purely digital, completely decentralized money can take the world out of the vicious cycle of inflationary booms and busts. If it cannot, then nothing can. Otherwise most humans must change their nature and become pacifistic brothers and sisters instead of greedy individualists with mental disorders due to shitty parenting. Bitcoin exploits the real human nature to get closer to ideals of liberty, so I think it has better chances to make a dent in the universe than any pure philosophy.

I never suggested to use this for large value items. This is an anonymous p2p market we are talking about. You don't buy groceries or car on it. You use it in all cases where usual schemes fail:
1) When reputation is not available or irrelevant.
2) When there's a strong need to protect your person.
The use cases that follow from there are quite obvious:
1) One stranger wants to sell to another stranger a used iPod. Ebay would fine, but both of them have no reputation there and no need to build one (no one is doing regular business there).
2) People trade something illegal in their country. E.g. banned literature, unlicensed medicine, banned services etc.
No one is saying that anonymous p2p market could scale to every deal. It's raison d'être is to provide some safety in a situation of no initial safety. To trade not-very-expensive goods and services with people you do not or can not fully trust.

Current protection racket is not fueled by local extortion, but by taxing everyone and everything on global scale. So the cops are well paid and insured against injuries. In a wild-west scenario, racket is much more expensive and dangerous: you can't tax everyone and call for help. And you are injured it's likely that angry folks will finish you on the spot instead of paying for your insurance and pension. That's entirely another scale.
Also, the most lucrative profit: cash (gold) is much harder to loot. You can break into a house and grab some IKEA furniture and a notebook worth $1500, but you can't steal a single bitcoin from there.

Lets make two imaginary experiments:
1) If BTC was distributed "fairly" to many more people, it'd be better than pre-mine, but what would happen next? Since it's new and obscure, many people would gladly sell it for pennies to few "early adopters" who are big believers. So very quickly most coins would end up in the hands of few anyway. Since initial mining was easy on CPU and Windows application was quickly available, average Joe had the same chance mining some coins for himself just like if he could claim and sell off his "fairly distributed" coins in the imaginary alternative.
2) If coins were generated much slower so 50% is done not in 4 years, but in 40 years, it wouldn't change the shape of inflation curve much: it'd still be looking like 1/x: earlier generated coins would constitute larger portion of tradable monetary base than those that are added later. It would only keep noticeable inflation for longer making mining more subsidized than market would want. Since 75% of coins will be done in less than 8 years, everyone has a comfortable view that only during a few years their savings would be diluted by miners, but then the "mining tax" would be quickly very tiny. More inflationary coin would be under risk of a less inflationary altcoin competitor.

My philosophy is voluntarism: if you have another opinion, I can only debate with you peacefully until my argument wins or loses.

That's what is written in history books that were heavily controlled by the kings. ("History is written by the winners").
The farther in time you go, the more magical and voluntary the kings are (e.g. "a good king was elected to protect poor farmers from evil gangs that robbed them in 1189") when in fact it's more possible that all kings were the gangsters and the winners were getting tribute while the losers were painted "bad".

When talking to a hardware guru at Bitcoin2014 (who's been mining sicne 2010 and producing his own ASICs) he said that any POW can be done more efficiently in specialized hardware and ultimately will lead to farms of such hardware located in the most efficient places.
About 51% attack: right now Mr. Evil would have to compete with CN and TW foundries that are filled with orders from Apple, Samsung and hundreds of other hi-tech companies. They'd have to spend way too much time and money than you can simply calculate by multiplying today's cost by petahash. Then, there are many temporary workarounds to survive the attack should it happen (via social mechanisms).
If anyone is about to hurt Bitcoin, 51% attack is the most wasteful and pointless way to do it. It's much cheaper to attack some altcoins and yet very few people bother spending their time and money on them (because they can focus on mining BTC).
51% attack is not a problem at this point.

Sorry, the idea of Bitcoin is not compatible with the idea of state (neither logically nor empirically): 
TLDR: if state and institutions alike can possibly work in your opinion, then using gigahashes of decentralized computing power (and weird "private keys" that are hard to understand and secure) is a waste of time. The whole idea of blockchain is to 1) avoid corruptible institutions and 2) protect against ones that might actively fight back. So choose one thing you believe in: human-driven institutions or distributed crypto-ledger.

Variance is not a problem when the difficulty does not grow. But when it grows 10-20%, variance actually eats your money. Simple visualization: if you are lucky, you simply get a block at the same difficulty (so the same payout as when the difficulty is stable), but if you are unlucky, you get it at another difficulty (with lower chance), so it reduces your average profit. If your variance is very small, you take maximum from each difficulty level without risk of earning less only because your "fair share" was postponed.

Do you mean this one? 


I'll try to be clearer. You evade property taxes when either there's no one to come to your door to demand them, or it's more cost-efficient to protect yourself against anyone attempting to do so.
How could this ever happen?
Only when the government is reduced in size and power and market is able to provide more robust protection services. 
Why the government would get smaller? 
Because government would run on taxes only (and property taxes are not the biggest chunk of them) and there will always be people who evade taxation this way or another (by hiding property, or bribing decision-making bureaucrats).
As more people evade taxation, less is given to government which has to lay off its people. Also, market develops more profitable jobs and people change gov jobs for market jobs. This all contributes to lessening of the govt power and legitimacy. If no one wants to work for government, only cheap poorly educated people will remain who could be bribed or otherwise ignored. This by itself, of course, does not suddenly remove property taxes.
So what happens when only dumb people and greedy bribed bureaucrats are left in the government and only source of income is to tax property owners? I believe at this point people have enormous wealth and enough private protection methods to just tell them to fuck off. No one would respect some bullies who no longer provide anything of value and do not look nice or smart.
To have a taste of this, welcome to Ukraine 2013/14: most cops are not respected for years (and they are bribed all the time) and when people are outraged by kidnappings and shootings, they simply come to them and disarm them. This euromaidan was quite interesting to watch because you see how mere change in perception of the government makes cops truly fear for themselves and change their opinion of the higher powers.

How Bitcoin works: digital signatures allow us to implement "ownership". When you pass a coin to another person, you create a file called "transaction" where you put reference to a previous transaction and a public key (or "address") of the next owner. You sign that file with the private key corresponding to the public key ("owner") of that previous transaction. Now you release this transaction to the world and the world sees that now another key owns that coin. New owner does the same thing to pass the coin further. Such a chain of transactions is a chain of "ownership" and the latest transaction displays who is the current owner.
The problem, of course, is:
1) How to make sure everyone has seen the new owner?
2) How to prevent you from "forking" the chain: spending your coin twice to different public keys?
To do that, you collect newly received transactions, put them in a file called "block", append some metadata to it (reference to the previous such block, timestamp and a 'nonce' - arbitrary "number used once"). You hash that file, meaning you compute a cryptographic hash function. In Bitcoin it is SHA256(SHA256(block)). Hash function gives pseudo-random output: you cannot predict what will be the result until you actually compute the function. Once you compute it, you get something like a12fe7b15527a... The goal is to produce not just any hash, but "rare" or "difficult" hash: partially consisting of zeros (on one end). E.g. 000007b152ab1c... You increment the "nonce", re-hash the block and see what hash do you get. The more zeroes you need, the lower the probability to find a good one. It's like a lottery: you never "get closer" to "solving a block", your chances are always the same for the given difficulty.
Everyone (every miner) looks for a good enough hash and releases the block once a valid hash is found. Most people receive it, drop their own version of the block and start "hashing" another one "on top" of this fresh one. This way a blockchain is created. 
What's the purpose of this? Everyone accepts only those transactions as valid that are present in the "most difficult" valid chain. It means, the chain of blocks itself should not contain double-spends, and it's cumulative "difficulty" must be the greatest. No one needs to trust anyone: they just see the data and compute the difficulty of this data. The most difficult chain is considered "the consensus", the proper ordering of transactions.
The whole network adjusts difficulty of the next block based on how quickly the previous 2016 blocks were created. If they were created 20% faster than in 2 weeks, then the next 2016 blocks will have 20% higher difficulty ("more zeroes"). If they were created 15% slower, then the difficulty will get 15% lower ("less zeroes").
Bitcoins are created as a reward for the blocks: each block may have first transaction to create some number of coins out of nothing (literally). Such transaction is called "coinbase", a transaction that becomes another root for a new chain of ownership (this "coin" can later be split or combined with other coins).
Note: why other miners have incentive to stop finding a hash for their block and "start over" with the latest received block? The answer is twofold: their chances are the same anyway (except for 2015th block before difficulty is expected to increase :-), and their reward must be buried under 100 blocks to become spendable (other clients will not acknowledge transactions spending the coinbase until it's deep enough in the most difficult blockchain). Since no miner (normally) can produce 100 blocks alone, they must cooperate and accept each others' blocks. By the time their reward becomes spendable, they have plenty of other blocks that have not-yet-spendable reward. So they have incentive to keep going and cooperate with everyone (as long as it is profitable for them at all; otherwise they just disconnect from the network).

Before global markets and gold-based money, yes. In a global free-ish economy state can only exist when it can suck a lot of energy from the monetary system while trying to be invisible to the people ("Prices go up and you lose your job? Evil capitalists and speculators are to blame.") 
Physical money (gold, silver) is too easy to confiscate and too hard to move around, so when it was needed, it was confiscated quickly ( However, today people are so used to hot water, electricity and the internet, that you cannot move back. When state cannot take control over money and starts going from door to door and kicking shit out of individuals, the illusion breaks down. Cops would no longer believe that they work for good guys (majority) and catch the bad guys (illicit minority). To survive cops would have to rob everyone and then they'll face massive pushback.

Bitcoin does not coexist with a state. 99,99% of people are not even aware of Bitcoin yet. When they are, we can talk how the state coexists with that knowledge.
There's a correlation between being a stateless place and being a shithole. Maybe the real cause is that non-shitholes produce wealth and wealth attracts thieves (the biggest of them is the state). Learn a bit on the history of medieval cities. Those were granted some autonomy from surrounding landlords on conditions of bigger freedoms. Basically, merchants bought themselves out of slavery to some degree. Then, some portion of the state was still in place and growing on the wealth that is generated by the market.

No, it doesn't. Transactions are malleable because there's no single simple compatible method to scratch signatures from the input scripts to create a non-malleable hash.

It is not a pyramid scheme either becuase (see the definition), there is not one to promise any gains. You buy a scarce commodity. More people buy - higher the price and liquidity, but that's not anyone's promise. There are people who find holding some BTC attractive even if liquidity or price does not grow at all. Everyone can win by never "cashing out". If the market is liquid and stable enough to make it worth  for you to keep some coins in your wallet to spend when you need to, then it does not matter for *you* if you there are people making 100x gains. If you make 2% gain or even 0%, but actually benefit from private, non-reversible low-cost international transactions (whichever matches your needs, then holding some Bitcoin is already a win for you.
Would you please point me to a specific flaw in any of my arguments? Just saying "little relation with reality" sounds more like an insult rather than a correction from which everyone can learn.

Friends will confirm to you a 8-digit fingerprint of your transaction, so if they happen to receive a second copy from the attacker, you'll know if they sign the correct transaction.
The scenario you are painting is "my device is really badly hacked and I use it". If you'd like you could have another device of yours as another "friend" to have two factors under your control.
My point is: 
1) This scheme is not worse in face of various evil scenarios than any other solution. E.g. multi-device signing is built-in for those who want it.
2) This scheme is better than others in face of more mundane attacks. Like when all your devices are lost/confiscated. Or when you are a normal person and just have one device. Or when you keep an unencrypted paper backed to your wallet because you may forget your password (paper backup would spoil your privacy, but still won't allow access to your money to strangers).

Ownership is usually defined in moral-absolutist law-enforcement terms. Like some platonic idea of "ownership". In real life power matters. 
Lets say you are holding a wallet in your hand. It's very likely that for a random stranger the danger of an attempt to snatch it outweighs the potential (unknown) profit. However, if you advertise that your wallet holds $100K, you'll be quickly surrounded by people trying to take it (possibly including cops). When your money is taken and folks ran away, the fact that you truly "owned" the cash does not matter. Until you find a bigger guy with a bigger gun to stand by your side and find your cash, it's forever gone. Usually to attract such big guys we use the idea of "a government" and "property rights". So it looks like that: "I _owned_ that wallet, so now my fellow citizens must give up 50% of their revenues for armed guys who will try to find it." Which is really stupid if you think deep about it.
So forget about "ownership" and think in terms of "power" and "exclusivity".
When you create a private key, compute an address from it and send there some BTC, you have exclusive power to spend that coin. And you also keep in mind that it must be exclusive if you want to have that power at all. Because if someone discovers your key, they will also have the power and will use it very quickly to make it exclusive for themselves. Since the cost of running after the so-called "thieves" is infinitely larger than the value of stolen coins, feeling bad about theft is a waste of time. It's very unlikely that even ideal judicial system would ever help you recover your coins. So term "ownership" is really meaningless in bitcoin context.

What? Price falls simply because more people sell coins than number of people buying coins. Selling can occur via exchange or via merchants. Buying can happen via open exchanges or private exchanges (linked to those same merchants).
It does not matter how exactly people spend or buy coins. Price only depends on ratio between those who wish to get rid of coins and those who wish to get more coins. Last year price quickly jumped to $1200 which made a lot of holders 10x richer. Even if before they were "holding", every one of them has now incentive to capitalize on that increase and spend/sell up to 90% of their coins. That naturally pushes price down. 
For the next wave to occur, there must be expectation that price won't go even lower and there must be a critical mass of newcomers who never owned a coin. These people will not buy coins until they are sure that price is going to go up. If it's stable or even drops sometimes, why risk buying a lot of coins? Let's wait till price starts to go up and then we'll buy in and maybe sell off some portion to have a nice quick reward. This creates quick and sharp bubbles and bursts.
Merchants' adoption and infrastructure changes mostly important to validate bitcoin for newcomers to become confident in it. But even then they won't "jump in" until price noticeably moves up. They'll wait.

The state as a hierarchical system of organized violence on a large scale is not needed to solve local conflicts. You may have some local "democracy club" when, e.g. you own an apartment in a 10-apartment house. But this club's decisions will be limited only to this house and only to that part of people's lives that concern other neighbors. E.g. if one house does not like people smoking in it and another tolerates that, these two wouldn't even think going war on each other because it's too damn expensive. They'll just let each other live.
Also, there are many alternatives to solving delicate property rights issues. In case of apartments, there are other ways to avoid conflicts (and some people prefer them):
1. Have a single owner of the house who rents all apartments (variant: leases them with broad freedoms for 100 years like in UK).
2. Have your own separate house.
3. Any sorts of independent services. E.g. you may have single water supply, but individual air conditioners. Or a centralized air conditioning system, but individual internet cables. Etc.
Many times some problems simply do not exist due to local culture. Or, local culture prevents some solutions from being used at all. E.g. in some place people may be rich and nice that they never argue and do not need to solve "free rider" problem. If the water supply is broken, a few tenants will be fine to sponsor the replacement that benefits everyone. Or, if people are jerks in some place, they'll have more individual separated places - individual houses, individual water supply provided by competing agencies etc. The point is, in absence of a huge hierarchy of state agencies, all these options will become available on the market. People will be free to choose how exactly they want to solve their conflicts. And what's most important: no violence will be sponsored by millions of taxpayers. If you can't find a peaceful solution with your enemy, you bear 100% of the cost. So you think twice before going war on someone.

It is possible to a certain extent. If you need to store coins, you can use multisig with some number of parties (friends or corporations) in case you forget your password or lose your key. If you need to buy coins, you can limit your risks by buying in small batches. Say, instead of buying $1000 at once, you send $100, buy BTC, move it out, then send in $100 more, buy, move out etc. At any time your exposure to another party is limited significantly.

Where do you take this data? To my knowledge, many governments (at least federal ones) are broke, that is, they borrow (print) money to continue operation.
Then, even if your govt extracts more for less, they still have certain budget which will have to be reduced when people being evading taxes (if no one evades taxes, then no one is against the state, then it's pretty efficient wonderful business already, good for you). So today they spend 1 PLN out of 9 PLN expecting to have 8 PLN to spend for their activities. Tomorrow they will earn not 9 PLN, but only 8 PLN. So they'll have only 7 PLN for their activities. Some projects will get cancelled, delayed, some people will have to be fired. Either government loses nice image ("pensions are stolen") or loses power (cops are fired). Both contribute to overall perception that state is not a cool place to give money to. More evading happens and the cycle repeats.

The key itself is just a big integer. Any integer will do, but if it's greater than order of secp256k curve (order = number of points on a curve), it will "wrap" around. So if your key is (order + 1), then it's the same as being equal 1.
The order of secp256k1 is FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE BAAEDCE6 AF48A03B BFD25E8C D0364141. If you just compute SHA256 of some random data, you would have to have more than 124 '1' bits in a row to have your key be greater than the curve order. Your chances to get 124 '1' bits in a row are so impossibly small that you may not worry about that at all. For instance, random UUIDs are using 128 bits and they are considered long enough to ensure uniqueness of any given identifier no matter when created. 
After all, even if you accidentally create a key which is greater than the order, it won't break things and won't necessarily make your public key less secure: attacker wouldn't know anyway if your public key is closer to generator point G than usual to bruteforce the key.
However, for multiple other reasons, do not store *all* your funds on a single key. Keys can be badly created because of low entropy RNGs, or because of bugs, or buggy signatures can leak the keys, or software may be backdoored, etc. Always have several different keys created with different methods, different software or hardware.
More info: 
The checksum could be added if you write the key in some format like Base58Check (like the address). bitcoind3 below presented WIF key as an example.

Actually, to use multisig you don't even need P2SH. For more than a year multisig scripts up to 3 signatures are "standard": propagating quickly enough so you don't need to wrap them in P2SH. P2SH is useful to send money to non-standard scripts and shift costs from the sender to the recipient.

Nodes do not vote for "correct vs. incorrect" - that's a common myth which brings ideas like "what if miners change the rules and we all die".
Every non-mining node checks the rules and "correctness" on its own. If some miners change rules, they simply stop being valid miners from the point of view of other nodes.
Miners only vote for which history of transactions is the main one. That's it. If there's a fork (which happens once a day on average), both histories are completely valid, but we all have to know which one *everyone else* considers "the main one". That's where proof-of-work is needed. Validity checks are done by everyone before that.

In a free market, the cheapest option would prevail. And the cheapest is not to fund a dangerous army to extract debts. How will you take that debt from that army then, fund another army? It is cheaper to ensure proper security from the start. Do not give BTC in someone else's hands in the first place. Or if you give, make sure they have more to lose than they could possibly gain. (So if something rare and irrational happens, it would be happily covered by the insurance company.)
Real-time trading is fun and all, but there's nothing wrong with having a less realtime exchange where all funds are in multisig escrow and every 15 minutes an auction happens where people put their bids and asks and then all bitcoins are unlocked according to the matching orders. Exchange would never have full access to everyone's funds.
Also, in the long run no one needs those exchanges at all because fiat money will be long dead. You'll have your contracts on blockchain insured by real BTC collateral, locked up with some escrow or your counterparty. Like so:

There is no spec and no spec is actually possible. Anyone coming up with a formal description will only achieve a "description", not a "prescription". The nature of blockchain requires actual cooperation by nodes, deviation from common standard is not tolerated. We can't just stop and wait for everyone to fix a "bug" in all clients to match the holy scripture. 
If 90% of nodes deviate from (or misinterpret) what is written by someone, then that's the standard, not your piece of paper.
So it's perfectly natural that everyone tries to use the same piece of software, no matter how hard to read it is, and introduce alternative software very carefully and slowly.
We should also consider that it's a rare case when absolute compatibility is required. In many other networking systems, communication is done from peer to peer, so a pair of peers may tolerate each other's differences in protocol implementation. E.g. website may deviate from HTML standard and Firefox may or may forgive it to some degree. Or one webserver may not understand your client, but many others will. In case of blockchain, we have a network-wide consensus. Everyone basically talks to everyone at the same time. You and your friend cannot use slightly different version of Bitcoin between yourselves and still stay on the same blockchain (outside the blockchain you can use whatever comm protocol you want to send txs, blocks or other data). This is new and unprecedented, so we should treat it as a journey and think for ourselves instead of trying to apply existing patterns and methods invented for other purposes.

Most of the violence in the world is sponsored by taxation/inflation. If you just leave usual psychopaths without access to the state, you'd have 10000x more peaceful world. Also, if someone goes crazy, there's usually no way to prevent them from blowing off something. What you can do, however, is to educate people to leave in peace and allow them to earn decent income to avoid becoming psychopaths in the first place.
Finally, all violence without the state is never sponsored by some "free money". If someone wants to fight psychopaths, or drug dealers, or gays or jews, they are going to do it out of their own pocket. Something tells me that not many people would love wasting money on destruction instead of comfortable personal consumption. Psychopaths in the governments can afford themselves wars because they do not pay for them and keep a tight control over few parties that control finance thus preventing normal people from opting out.

Government protects your property at a price of 50% of your property, highly expensive and risky court/police system (it's expensive for you to use it and someone else can use it against you with devastating effects) and unilateral social policies. You are comparing this state of affairs to imaginary "total anarchist chaos destroying industrial economy and private property". But I'm not proposing such dichotomy to you. In order to have something more efficient and safe than a government way of doing things, we need proper technology. E.g. ubiquitous communications channels allow anyone to spread ideas freely almost without censorship. They do not give some special powers to violent nutheads, only protect your own liberty. Bitcoin is similar: it protects individual's liberty by making government's (and anyone else's too, but govt is the biggest violent actor) intervention less effective, but it does not lead to "less safe" Chicago.
Only psychopaths seriously propose how society should be organized. I have no idea how society should rule itself, but it'd be cool if people could protect each other from themselves and use tech that allows to come to a consensus freely, without kicking anyone's asses. And anyone working on such tech is by definition works against the government because the idea of government is "instead of voluntarily coming to a consensus, an arbitrary group of folks will kick ass of everyone else and establish their own rules and order". Bitcoin does not tell you what money you should use. A group of people use it and allow anyone to join. You can either join, or ignore, or start your own altcoin, or whatever. That's how consensus on "money" is being built voluntarily, globally and without "small villages" where some small rulers kick butts to "establish order".

Yes. Imagine you have $10M in BTC and can afford paying $100 per transaction. It's still cheaper and safer than holding that much in gold, real estate or stocks. But there are 10x more people who can afford paying $11 per transaction, not more. If the block limit is increased, then 1) you can pay $11 instead of $100 2) liquidity of your coins increased 10x (because more people can receive it from you directly) 3) miners will earn more.
So whenever fees are driven up by competition for a space in block, everyone who can transact will be interested in increasing that space.

In-person gold transactions are mostly meaningless (most of the economy is on the wire) and still costly. How'd you go about securing your gold dust and verifying it within milliseconds? How will the business owner trust employee not to steal some pieces of gold? 
Our current fiat economy is direct and logical consequence of the gold standard. Paper money and banking evolved precisely out of limitations of the gold. Gold does not have a block size limit, it has much worse limits: it does not fly, cost of storage and transportation grows with the amount, verification takes much more than a few milliseconds. In all practical scenarios gold always has a 3rd party risk (in form of your bank or hired guards etc.), just like fiat money. Only bitcoin can be easily used with almost no 3rd party risk.

In my view, peace exists for economic reasons *despite* the existence of state (which is at constant war with its citizens). Also, the mainstream view of places like Somalia is highly stereotyped.
I think the burden of proof is always on someone who states that something exists (the god, the state) and that it has some moral authority that can violently coerce via its agents (church, elected government). State is just another religion that uses ideas of moral authority to conduct violence. No one proved anything yet people believe it's good and true to have a state.

In the Mycelium v1.2 (released a few days ago) we decided to avoid storing secret under a new security mode introduced in iOS8 (called "when passcode set"). That mode supports both device passcode and TouchID, but has a few risks and complicates the UI. E.g. when you remove the passcode, the wallet master key will be erased. We decided to store the passcode just like in v1.0 (encrypted while device is locked), but with additional interactive check for TouchID which is not linked with system secure store (called Keychain). Apple does not provide a similar method to ask for the passcode, so we can't provide such protection for devices without TouchID.
The app itself does not provide in-app passcode. We are exploring different options to improve this in future updates. Either with full support for system passcode, or adding in-app passcode, or something else.

In both cases it is actual transactions that make blockchain expensive to validate. So either people transact a lot and compete for a limited block space, or it's people transact a lot and compete for a limited bandwidth/CPU capacity to validate new blocks. Possibly it's former, but it's not obvious to me.

SHA is a "Supposedly Secure Hash Function", an algorithm designed by some folks at NSA so they can fuck us all when Bitcoin is widely deployed. 
NB. Satoshi replaced it with double-round SHA2 so the input for second iteration of SHA is always pseudorandom which makes potential round reduction close to impossible. In some sense this technique is similar to how sponge construction in Keccak (SHA3) deliberately loses data on each step. Double hashing achieves the same "throwing info out" to make reversal close to impossible.

It's unknown whether non-compliant behaviour is a backdoor or a bug. E.g. if somehow ECDSA signature is encoded non-canonically, is it a bug, or a malicious attempt to communicate a bit of a master seed over blockchain? The goal is to make sure wallet is fully deterministic and does not have any room to decide how to encode its output. All of output should be defined by the auditable master seed and user input.
Anyone who sets up a device can optionally audit it. So the auditor must have access to the master seed.
If you need to keep the master seed secret, you could do the following:
1. Buy 100 devices, configure every one of them.
2. Audit 97 of them, while keeping 3 of them in a 2-of-3 multisig operation.
3. Each time you send or receive funds, do the same (with lower amounts) with the other 97. So all 100 devices operate with similar frequency of transactions.
4. If only one of them is backdoored, then you have only 3% chance that it's one of the remaining 3 where you won't detect it. But you need any 2 of 3 to be backdoored, so your chance to miss the backdoor is 3 (combinations of 2-of-3) of 4950 (combinations of 2-of-100) which is 0.06%.
In other words, if you keep a vault full of bitcoins, 99,93% guarantee that your hardware is not backdoored is pretty good. And only at a small cost of paying for 100 devices. If you buy 300 devices instead, you increase your chances to 99,993%.
At the same time, that's the chance of being caught for the developer, so they would most certainly risk complete loss of reputation, customers and maybe even law enforcement investigation.

Hardness of KDF depends on the (lack of) entropy in the user-entered data. If you have a low-power device, then you can be explicit about user seed and have something like: "Please enter long enough random text to ensure that keys are generated well". Then your KDF can be as simple as HMAC-SHA256.
Remember: this is mostly for audit purposes and ultra-paranoid people. Honest wallets should have good RNG in the first place, so even if user enters "qwerty" the master seed would be strong nonetheless.
In other words, the spec means to say "if you make user enter weak text (e.g. a password), then you must compensate it with a stronger KDF; otherwise the wallet can take advantage of a backdoored RNG". I'll edit it accordingly.

I don't see how 2 MB solves the price problem. There's enough capacity for big buyers and big holders. There is not enough capacity for small payments which hurts payment processors, but has marginal impact on capitalization. Given that, capacity increase MUST be done without hurting capitalization provided by the holders. SegWit attempts to do exactly that - extra capacity is provided to those who opt-in performance fixes and sign up to an asymmetric tx cost: UTXOs are 4x more expensive than proofs (witnesses).

The initial lock-up transaction must be confirmed (which "opens" the "payment channel"). This can be done days before the actual payment.
When the time of payment comes, these locked-up funds are being spent in a not-yet-confirmed transaction. Recipient trusts that transaction because it trusts Operator (who is co-signer) to not double-spend it. This way Recipient can instantly accept that unconfirmed transaction, unlike the case when it comes from total stranger who can double-spend if he pleases.
@_date: 2015-01-23 12:47:34
Ah, I see what you mean. This effectively requires Operator to lock up as much money as being settled across all payments at any given time. This could be a huge amount of cash. Impulse scheme requires no capital investment from Operator at all.
I'm thinking about something like what you suggest, but in a decentralized way, Ripple-like. Parties are transferring IOUs through the chain of mutually-escrowed nodes. Each IOU is backed by a nash equilibrium of 2-of-2 multisig escrow of at least 2x amount. Capital must be locked up, but it's spread between many parties (each earning fees) vs one single payment operator.

That's called cartel which does not work in a free market like bitcoin mining. If some miners agree to limit amount of transactions to drive up the price, every one has an incentive to anonymously allow more transactions and earn more.
I'm not concerned about "node count drop" because it's not proven to have any relation to the security of the network. I can run 100 nodes all of which will be controlled by me. So do they count like "100" or "1"? Security of the network is proportional to the value of the network. The more money is at stake, more people care, more hashrate is being invested, more money is spent on development, bugfixes, monitoring etc.
@_date: 2015-01-23 10:56:14
No. The purpose of the proposal is to make unconfirmed txs sent to you by strangers trustable by adding trusted Operator to co-sign them.
Double-spend could occur if both Payer and Operator sign off a double-spending transaction. This could happen in either of two cases: 1) Payer and Operator conspire against Recipient 2) Payer stole Operator's key and signs off transactions how he pleases.
The proposal is not about protecting Payer from Operator (Payer does not have any additional risk here, except for delayed refund), but about protecting Recipient from Payer via trust that Operator won't sign off double spends.

Altcoin will never surpass because the value is not in some technical capacity, but in social agreement that takes time and money to develop.

Coins are not escrowed by Operator. Operator's only job is to not sign doublespends. Operator does not hold the funds and cannot lose or steal them. If Operator refuses to sign user's transactions, user will get full refund after timeout.
The risk here is only this: Operator's key (or master key) is leaked and merchants can't trust anymore not to be double-spent. User's funds are still safe and under user's control as always. The problem arising from revocation/recreation of Operator's key is the only (but difficult) problem to solve here.

"priced in" works in an "efficient" market (where everyone roughly has the same knowledge). Bitcoin market is highly inefficient because there are new people learning about BTC and deciding to invest coming every day.
In other words, everyone who knows about halvings, already "priced that knowledge in" and purchased all BTC they can. But there are still new people buying BTC from miners every day - 3600 BTC/day. And halving is completely orthogonal to this incoming demand. If today miners produce and sell 3600 BTC, tomorrow they produce and sell 1800 BTC. But the "new hands" demand tomorrow is no different from demand today or yesterday. If it changes, it's for any other reason, but not for the halving.

Who said the aim is to avoid full blocks? The aim is to fit in as much transactions, as to achieve a good balance between network performance and liquidity.

Of course, if the balance is within the limit, then limit does not play important role (other than to prevent rare ugly spikes).

Re: "without a very large hashrate differential"
Large hashrate differential is a pre-requisite to call a soft fork being "activated". You can't really use new rule unless &gt;95% of miners enforce it. Usual rule is miners will ignore invalid-under-new-rules blocks after 95% threshold is reached. Once 95% is reached, the rest 5% risk losing money if they don't upgrade too, so upgrade happens rather soon.
Before 95% of hashrate is reached, soft-fork is not active and no one can really use it or abuse it. If it takes forever to reach, say, 90%, miners and the rest of the world can as well give up and stop waiting for new rule to become active because no one is going to enforce it until 95% is reached.

"Out of these **5000 traces**, 1940 were discarded due to measurement noise. Out of the remaining 3060 traces, 110 were identified as having their DA sequence terminate in at least four elliptic curve double operations with one of these being a false positive (again, discovered in retrospect). Next, we randomly chose 85 out of the 110 available traces and applied the lattice attack described in Section 2.3. Repeating the attack **20 times** (each time choosing a random subset containing 85 traces) resulted in a successful key extraction in **4 out of the 20 attempts**." (emphasis mine)
In other words, this attack is largely irrelevant for wallets that do not reuse the keys OR do not make payments often enough to let the attacker hang around you and measure radiation from your phone.
This attack becomes relevant for an enterprise HSM that performs many transactions in an automated manner and reuses the same key for many signatures.

You are misunderstanding the Metcalfe's Law by using txcount squared. Metcalfe's Law as applied to money must sound like "value of money is proportional to the total number of *potential* exchanges, weighted by their worthiness". For instance, gold (AU) has a big monetization value because there are a lot of hands out there who can accept gold from you and give something valuable in return. But actual physical transactions are very rare.
The reason for this is that money works not only at the moment of exchange, but all the time before the exchange because it allows you to delay the purchasing decision until you know when and what you need to buy. 
A more accurate approximation would be to use UTXO size squared, but that's also highly inaccurate due to sybils.

The alternative could be to select oldest single outputs enough to cover the payment. But sooner or later user will end up with multiple small enough outputs that must be consolidated. Interestingly, BIP70 allows sending multiple transactions covering the total amount. But the other side most probably uses unique addresses per invoice, so these outputs are still linkable via the target address (unless BIP70 is also extended with stealth addresses). Also, for some cases you really need a single atomic transaction (think of some smart contracts), so to protect privacy you'd need a real coin mixing or CoinJoin. What would you suggest?

While it'd be great to have greater capacity, note that distribution of demand is usually like this: smaller-value transfers happen more frequently. This means that people with serious stake at Bitcoin do not need higher capacity - they hold BTC and sell parts of it from time to time. And they need a censorship-resistant decentralized network to keep their stash liquid and secure. People who really need higher throughput do not transact high volumes of cash by definition and therefore they do not matter as much to the capitalization compared to most of the holders. (Note that i'm not saying they do not deserve larger throughput - i myself would love to do payments and holding on a single network.)
There would not be such conflict if it was easy to support 100 Mb blocks. We'd have that already. But the reality is that such larger capacity puts higher burden on all validating nodes thus affecting all those holders who need to verify one payment a month. The risk is: big load of small-value payments by people who don't mind someone else validating blockchain for them will detract big holders who will change PoW algorithm and continue on a separate, small-block fork. 99% of capitalization will move there (not without turbulence) and those who demand higher capacity will lose in short-term price decline and then get back to where they started: all the money is on the more constrained chain.

I never said that transactions has something to do with value. Limited number of transactions hurts liquidity, therefore hurts the value. But even with 1MB limit bitcoin is hugely superior to gold. So it can and will be monetized enormously regardless of the limit. Bitcoin transaction fees will rise pretty heavy, but they will still be much smaller than those of gold transactions. So on one hand, Bitcoin won't stop growing in value and usefulness, but on another, everyone would be very interested in expanding block size limit to reduce costs and improve liquidity.
My takeaway: Bitcoin will remain valuable and limit will be eventually raised. However, "every person on the blockchain" will not happen until hardware and software catches up in 5-10-15 years (and this has nothing to do with the block size limit or lack thereof).

Zero transaction propagation estimates are not giving you any 100% guarantee. They are simply estimates based on day-to-day operation of the network. Also, they act as a light detection of double-spends. Of course, a determined attacker may try to mine his own block, but in practice it will rarely happen (bigger payments worth doing that won't be zero-conf anyway).
Also, it's a cluster of monitoring nodes operated by a 3rd party (Chain). If you trust them, they provide valuable audit of the zero-conf transaction. But they also can easily scam you too. So it's not really comparable to a fully trust-free blockchain.

Yep, I'm trying to make a value-free argument on how things will happen, not how they "should happen". Regardless of how people will change Bitcoin, it's ubiquity will always be limited by existing hardware capabilities. I think hardware and comm channels will evolve faster than growth of population and transactions. And block limit will grow anyway eventually.
I've studied sidechains as a tool for scaling, but it seems they are not an adequate tool for that. A hierarchy of sidechains of continent/country/city scales helps with scaling only if top-level miner does not also validate all subordinate transactions, but simply accepts SPV proofs. But lower-level chains will then have lower hashrate and thus will be vulnerable to arbitrary "confiscation attacks" when a more powerful miner that can't do 51% attack on his level can simply take all pegged coins on the lower-level sidechains. It will be like European Central Bank can't even double-spend Fed, but can confiscate all gold from a smaller bank in Boston.

2. Your incoming transactions must have 2 confirmation numbers: regular one and the one inherited from the lowest-confirmed unknown transaction (unknown tx version or script version). If all txs in the chain are known, "unknown confirmation" is MAX_INT.
3. Your node now can require safety margin for "unknown confirmation" compared to normal confirmation. E.g. require 6 confirmations for all transactions, but at least 12 confirmations for "unknown transactions". This will make attack on your node more expensive until you upgrade to new rules. If you never upgrade to new rules, you can always require more confirmations for unknown transactions.

If the wallet takes user-provided UTXOs, then this point does not apply to it. However, many wallets automate that process. The spec says "if you do automate that process, do so deterministically".
If you want to shuffle UTXOs, then you may use a similar sorting algorithm as for inputs and outputs defined further in the spec.

What do you mean by "checked header"? To be 100% sure you mine on a valid chain you must process all blocks prior to yours. Mining on a header means the same thing as "SPV" - you speculate that the previous guy did not waste his hashrate on a chain that'd be eventually abandoned.
@_date: 2016-01-08 11:04:29
I guess the case you are having in mind is this:
1. I make a payment to you which spends someone's segwit funds. Plus I use 51+% hashrate to satisfy your best-work check.
2. You have not upgraded to new segwit rules, so you see my best-work chain spending from some weird, but valid script, that you don't care about.
3. Once I got enough confirmations, I put my hashrate back to normal rules. The chain that you accepted is rejected by other miners because it's invalid under normal rules.
4. Your payment got reversed.
How's that risk different from risking from normal 51% attack?
1. I can amplify my capital by using anyone's funds on new-version txs (not only my own) to double-spend you and/or other non-upgraded parties.
2. I can amplify my hashrate by existing SPV-miners and half-SPV miners (who have not upgraded to new rules, do not include new txs themselves, but trust other miners to validate new txs correctly).
Here are some numbers: 
I think the amplification would not be that drastic in practice. In 6 confirmations you still have very low chance of being scammed even with huge amount of hashrate. 
The core problem here is that soft-fork is "censoring" (previously valid txs become rejected) and attack on soft-fork is "uncensoring". Protocol can't really force miners not to censor transactions and prevent them from doing soft-fork upgrades. So we, as users of the protocol, should care about our own safety just like we have to care about things like RBF. They can't be prevented, so we have to keep software being able to check the risks. Possibilities include:
1. Opt into a hard-fork behavior. If your full node detects new block version, stop processing until you upgrade.
2. Opt into semi-hard-fork behavior. Do not accept confirmations from tx tainted by unknown tx version or unknown script version. Or, simply double required # of confirmations to make attack much more costly. E.g. if your old-rules node would accept tx at 6 confirmations, but you detect new tx version in the chain of txs, then you can require 12 confirmations (until you upgrade to new client). 
Actually, you can require more confirmations only for new txs in the chain. If you have new tx only somewhere very deep in the chain (say, 1 week ago), but all subsequent txs up to your payment are of new version, then you can require normal number of confirmations for your payment.
I think it's a good idea to keep track of confirmation-depth of the unknown txs and scripts in order to bump up this "SPV" security for non-upgraded nodes.

@_date: 2016-06-02 14:07:31


AFAIK, rate of growth is proportional to each spending (each input). Which is strictly (much) faster than UTXO growth. UTXO is proportional to a number of outstanding contracts / accounts and, in principle, can grow arbitrarily slowly. But amount of ever existing outputs (and key images in Cryptonote/Monero/Bytecoin) is always growing with every transaction.
If Monero had the same scale and usage as Bitcoin now, its list of key images would be proportional to 1/3 of the size of the entire blockchain! And this list would have all be located in fast storage (!) in order to quickly figure if any given image key is absent in the list for each (!!) incoming transaction. (The list can be efficiently stored as an ordered tree, so search is log(N), but access is fully random, so all data must be quickly available.)
Of course, there are theoretical tricks to offload some work on the transacting users and make validation much faster, but so far I'm not aware of any of these optimizations being done in Monero.

No reason, but it's hard to make, support and improve a fully p2p discovery and communication for ~m~billions of non-nerd users. However, if you use the same protocol and wrap it in a commercial system that can earn small fees directly and manage all communication between all its customers, then you'd have a lovely product, not fully censorship resistant, but for daily payments that's not what's expected. And at least, it'll spawn competitors speaking compatible protocol.

1. Paper cash has trusted third party risk (debasement, for starters) and does not compare with Bitcoin at all on these grounds alone.
2. Paper cash is not fungible by physics: larger notes are less secure and often not accepted. The larger the denomination, the lower cost/benefit ratio for counterfeiters. Bitcoin's ECC crypto always has 128 bits of security no matter what amount.
3. Paper cash is not fungible by law: larger notes require extra KYC/AML bullshit. Or even any notes at all.

Show me what's perfectly fungible. An unnamed piece of gold with no traces will equally raise KYC/AML flags, but will not change its scarcity and inherent market price. Even if you have confidential system by default, centrally-controlled financial systems will layer a "kosherness certification" on top of it to flag all non-certified coins. The result will be the same, even if a bit more tedious.
Reality is, KYC/AML checks by recipients are simply *removing themselves* from the liquidity pool. Depending on ratio of KYC/AML checkers to total recipients, liquidity reduction for recipients could be much larger than reduction for senders. Liquidity loss will be the same only when exactly 50% of the economy is doing flagging. If it's only 10% in some market, then senders have 10x higher liquidity than flagging recipients.

Once segwit is deployed and relative locktime support gets activated (CSV), lightning and similar protocols based on unconfirmed timelocked txs will become immediately practical and super-efficient.

While Bitcoin solves a very difficult problem of creating a decentralized trust-minimized asset (bitcoin), there are tons of other assets that have not only a built-in counterparty risk, but also layers upon layers of 3rd party risks and, as a result, significant costs in holding and processing transfers. From simple things like gift cards to complex international financial agreements.
Some of these assets become irrelevant in the Bitcoin-based future (like SDRs), some get transformed dramatically (e.g. fiat currencies either disappear or morph into IOUs on all sorts of payment networks), some will remain and evolve because the underlying reasons for their existence have little to do with Bitcoin (such as stocks, bonds, futures etc).
People will surely (re)use Bitcoin as much as the network permits without compromising its principles of decentralization and censorship-resistance, but there will always be many more asses and use cases that will remain outside of Bitcoin (although other ledgers will surely be timestamped via some merkleized commitments for the long-term integrity).
The development of "private blockchains" is not coming from servicing the state or status quo, but quite the opposite: the existing businesses are trying to radically improve their processes and technology to face the quickly coming reality of a more decentralized, disintermediated relationships. Decentralized crypto-anarchy does not happen in one hop, it necessarily happens via step by step trust-minimization and technological improvements.

You misread it. We don't have 100% assurance of a X% consensus. We have X% assurance of a 100% consensus. We can never be 100% sure of the state of the decentralized system.

If you have actually learned a bit about Byzantine Generals' problem, you'd have an intuitive notion that it is absolutely impossible to come to a consensus **ever**. Your poor generals will indefinitely send confirmations for confirmations for confirmations for confirmations and never will be 100% certain that both sides have successfully obtained the same information and both know that.
Proof-of-work creates a **probabilistic consensus**. You can estimate the chance of being in sync, but that chance will always be below 1.
If you consider that higher message frequency increases chances for race conditions (forks) and there is a financial incentive to cause these race conditions (double-spends), it becomes pretty obvious that you need relatively high latency between PoW blocks. I hope this explains how "making blocks every few seconds" won't ever make sense unless most of the network transmits data at speed of light.

The crucial difference between PoW and PoS/WoT schemes is that a complete outsider can build some equipment to enter the network. He does not need to buy anything from existing holders. PoS is a scheme where to become a member of a club you have to buy a portion of membership from existing members. It's like a publicly traded company. In case of Bitcoin no existing holder or miner needs to allow you to enter the network. You just buy some computers (not necessarily from the bitcoin miners), plug them in and start mining.
Consequences are very different. In case of PoS, clubs and publicly traded companies it is possible to corner the market. Buy up the big chunk of votes and disproportionally affect operations. And owning that chunk for any duration is free. In case of PoW buying up X% of hashrate is 1) expensive to maintain and 2) gives no more than X% of decision making. The rest of hashrate can not be vetoed.  is important to keep X below 50%.

You cannot borrow BTC at zero interest rate. You can trade hundreds of millions USD in volume, but you cannot _take off market_ hundreds of millions dollars worth of BTC w/o overpaying a lot.
Miners are not producing enough per day, and there's already too many people with tons of money to convert to BTC, so you cannot buy that much in a few days. You have to buy over _months_. And if you do that w/o some cover, you are going to buy at avg price $20K instead of $2-5K.

While I agree that hard forks are okay, I disagree that soft forks are "bad", that's total FUD. The "new rules" are not safe to use unless super-majority of miners enforce them. And for a miner it's not safe to enforce these rules until all other miners agree to that. So if you run a "legacy node" the longest chain will be invalid *only* provided there's a 51% attack (because that's how much is needed to trick your node to accept blocks invalid under new soft-fork rules). Therefore the soft fork rules do not create any additional risks for legacy nodes. Actually, soft fork is much safer as it requires much less number of people to be concerned. And if those people (miners) do not reach the consensus, they can immediately notice that via forks. However, hard forks require each and every one to agree to new rules which is much more intrusive.

Note that only a diminishing portion of UTXO set has to be quickly accessible per block since UTXO grows, but blocks do not (at least, UTXO grows faster than blocks). So eventually, UTXO can be 7000 Mb, but only 1-10 Mb will be actually used to validate the next block.
I think simple heuristic like "older unspents are more likely to remain unspent" would help offloading 99% of UTXO onto cheaper and slower storage (SSD, spinning disk) and keep only the most recent unspents in RAM.

The soft-forked extension block that Pieter described has another nice property wrt to QC hazard (i heard this idea from Greg Maxwell a couple years ago): the damage that QC can do is limited to a pool of coins moved over to CT form. If a QC attack happens without a warning, the resulting "inflation" would be manifested in someone claiming all the pooled coins and moving them out to the classical chain, draining the pool. All the CT users will get robbed, all non-CT users will experience no inflation (they won't allow moving more coins from the "CT pool" outputs than there already is because these outputs are in cleartext and obey existing rules).
In the light of that, every user can opt into CT on their own and decide which portion of their funds is stored in CT outputs. If the perceived QC risk gets higher, people will allocate less money to CT and more to pre-CT outputs. In principle, it's possible that CT will be used for medium-term balances to provide "real-time" privacy, while larger amounts that move rarely will be sitting in non-CT outputs. Occasional conversion from non-CT to CT would happen with a help of a coinjoin to obfuscate the target destination of the payment.

Yes, the Lightning comes quite close, but not quite. It still tries to maintain adjustable transactions that may be released any time. Unfortunately, it creates a risk for all participants in the IOU chain to clear their debts earlier than they'd like to.
My scheme has no risks beyond every individual pair of nodes and no "sudden termination" risks in particular. Every pair of nodes voluntarily decides to clear the debts or terminate the escrow (one node initiates the transaction, then another one accepts it or not). No matter what these two nodes do, that does not affect debts and credits of any other nodes that have contracts with them.
On the other hand, in my scheme there's a risk of one node keeping the escrow indefinitely while Lightning Network attempts to protect against that. Unfortunately, that protection allows someone to troll/DoS more people than in immediate "contractual" vicinity of the attacker. My scheme relies on Nash Equilibrium: attacker generally does not want to withhold or lose escrow because his funds are also locked up.

"Payment channel" works great between these two parties, but that's not the case for random payments when you first go to McDonalds, than Starbucks, than Apple Store, then grocery store etc. You don't want to open payment channels with each of those as it requires a real bitcoin transaction for each channel (it'd be simpler to pay in BTC directly like we all do now). 
Instead, Lightning (and my proposal) build a "corridor" of such payment channels so you can keep some fixed number of payment channels open with some parties. When you need to pay someone who's not among these parties, you have to "discover" the possible path from you to them via intermediate payment channels and propagate the payment through several payment channels. So you don't need direct payment channels with millions merchants, you only need a handful of channels with someone who is in turn connected with someone else who is ultimately connected to a merchant you need.
The difference is that Lightning tries to ensure that no one can lock you out of money, so it uses adjustable transactions and allows any party to release pending payments into the blockchain at any time. This creates an operational burden as the entire chain of payment channels may need to commit their pending payments even if they don't want to when someone in the chain decided to. (That's how i understand this so far; but i have to study this more.)
My approach is to allow potential lock out, but implement economical incentive to prevent that. In return, all the burden and risk is always localized to a pair of parties concerned and does not touch anyone else.

The seed is stored in a keychain item that is supposed to be encrypted by the mix of the key-derived-from-passcode and a secret mix built into secure enclave. Even jailbreaking the device in theory should not allow arbitrary access to that item.
Only the database of transactions and balances is stored as a file (sqlite), but it has "data protection" flag on which makes it encrypted on disk in a similar way as items in the secure enclave. But this database does not contain secret keys.

"Just the headers" is only SPV level of security, not the "full node" level of security. The headers only tell you about amount of proof-of-work, but not whether underlying transactions are actually valid and without double-spends.
In "full node" security model miners vote only on which chain of valid txs is "the one". In "SPV" model miners can make up arbitrary chains of transactions as long as it has sufficient POW attached to make you accept it as the longest chain. The risk is that attackers cut you off from other nodes and feed you the fake chain with good enough POW so you accept it and trust their transactions (via merkle branches).

Which security measures do you mean? The idea is not to extend security, but move transactions out of the block chain with game-theoretic security model. As a result you get instant and scalable payments at a cost of larger locked up capital. E.g. you need to lock up $100 in order to move IOUs up to $50 limit in either direction. But if IOUs cancel each other out, you can run trillions of transactions within these $100 outside the blockchain (max amount per tx is $50, obviously). You don't lose those $100. But when you get them back, you pay the remaining debt, mining fees, and wait 10-20 minutes. The contract will become closed and you'd have to open another one to make another million transactions. In theory your wallet may constantly have $100 locked up and debts "refilled" separately with occasional btc transactions. The more you lock up, the more off-chain payments you can do per btc-transaction.

You should not just compare number of blocks to some probability. You should compare money at stake with a cost of forking the chain. The cost rises exponentially, but if your tx value rises exponentially too, it becomes important to take it into account.
E.g. $1 payment is safe to accept after 1 or 2 confirmations at current mining cost. But $1M payment might be worth attempting to rollback even after 6 confirmations.

So Edwards-25519 curve is nice because it allows for simpler const-time arithmetic and parallel formulas (which are implemented using AVX2 which is the main reason behind the speedup).
However, all Edwards curves have non-prime order, hence the need for extra complexity in the form of Decaf and Ristretto point compression algorithms that put all points into a prime order group. Secp256k1 has prime order out of the box, but does not have such nice formulas that allow that level of optimization.

Oh, wait. Sorry for a confusing reply.
What the paper means, is _in the realm of CT_ the inflation is possible. However, if your system is not all-CT, but has a cleartext realm too (as would be when CT is deployed in Bitcoin), then the effects of silent/uncontrolled inflation in-CT will become equivalent to a theft from the perspective of the cleartext realm.
That said, another issue is if the attacker never actually withdraws cleartext coins making theft eventually obvious, but continues silently exploiting the system until the trust in CT realm naturally erodes and the market emerges with different prices for cleartext coins and encrypted coins.
Would be interesting to figure out how to make a global proof of solvency across all encrypted coins once in a while...

I apologize for the incomplete title for this reddit submission. In the blog post we specifically mention that the bulk of speedup is due to AVX2, although even without it, using Rust, Edwards25519 and 64-bit arithmetic with 128-bit products is giving a significant speed up.


The reason we take uncompressed points is to keep the implementation cleaner. As of fairness, the points are being compressed when fed to the transcript, which has approximately the same cost as uncompressing them. Meaning, if we got compressed points, we'd pay cost of uncompressing them, but would use the compressed bytes as-is in the transcript, so the overall cost would be the same. I agree that the most clean way would be to have compressed points on the input, and we are going to do exactly that, after we figure out how to make the API and code around that look not awful :) However, I don't think this would affect the results even by 1%. But thanks for calling this out!


I don't think it makes a lot of sense to separate AVX2 out of the rest of the parts that allow for the performance. E.g. 64-bit arithmetic with 128-bit products also gives a considerable speedup and may count as "hardware acceleration" as well. And the point of using Edwards curve in the first place is to be able to use the simpler and parallelizable formulas, so it makes sense to actually do so if we can.


Is it the case even with the `nightly` feature? Bulletproofs library turns it on automatically, but curve25519-dalek does not, so if you don't specify it explicitly, it'll use 32-bit arithmetic instead of the 64-bit one. 
(Note to readers: the reason Andy was getting worse performance on curve25519-dalek vs Bulletproofs library is because of the above `nightly` flag that's on by default within BP and off by default in curve25519-dalek. Sorry for the confusion!)

For the record: i don't take any credit for this. I think there were plenty of discussions around adopting CT via extension blocks. The need to preserve ability to move coins back into original chain suggests the need for such a special address that looks like "anyone can spend" to old nodes, that would simultaneously check that total supply is respected (can't spend more from that address than was committed). And this is true for any use of extension blocks, not for CT specifically.
PS. oh my, "cleartext" and "confidential txs" have the same acronym...

CT in Bitcoin does not need to use the same curve as ECDSA signatures. Even the schnorr signatures can use a different curve. The reason that libsecp256k1 is such a powerful library is mostly historic (imho): Pieter Wuille originally designed it to optimize ECDSA signatures (and fix/avoid bugs in openssl), and made curve implwmentation clean and modular, so it made all the sense to build more interesting things on top of that design.

I remember when P2SH was discussed, people had objections to wasting NOP* opcodes. CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY can alternatively be implemented within a P2SHv2 script evaluator if there are a few other things that people need fixed. E.g. enforcing canonical signatures, compressed pubkeys, some other opcodes etc.
@_date: 2015-03-06 10:21:24
It's also possible to imagine a P2SHv2 which uses entirely different scripting engine. E.g. with fixed bugs, obsolete opcodes banned, currently disabled opcodes being enabled, new opcodes added etc. 
This is how it works:
1. You take a certain type of output script that is practically useless (can be spent by any miner including that tx). E.g. "provide data with hash matching this one".
2. You specify new narrow rules that apply to this script pattern only. 
3. If majority of miners decide to recognize spendings of this script only according to these narrow rules, then it becomes safe for everyone to use this output. Because any miner who decides to steal your output using the old rules will have their block rejected by other miners.
All legacy software will still verify spendings of these outputs because old, wider rules are strict superset of the newer narrow rules. But, of course, the legacy software does not know how and why use these scripts. 
Newer software may take advantage of these new rules by providing some new feature to the user.

I'm not focusing too much on SPV because I'm working on an off-chain scalable payment network on top of Bitcoin. 
The idea is Ripple-like IOU transfers, but instead of another currency, it uses BTC-denominated IOUs backed by Joint Escrow ( So you have infinite scalability for "dumb payments" (they don't touch blockchain) and they are still secured by the blockchain via escrowed coins.
Once that is implemented, we won't have to worry too much about 10 minute block interval or block limit (however, raising it would be nice for many other BTC applications). And you could buy your latte with secure truly instant confirmation.

In the times when the first picture was made, transistors were just invented and their inventors realized that they just need to scale down the p-n-p gates to atomic levels to have cheap and fast computers everywhere. So experts knew the exact scaling strategy for the decades (!). Today we are getting close to that predicted limit. We do have computers on our wrists, in our pockets, in our homes, in our charging adapters, pencils. But we also getting to the limit predicted and known for decades. Moore's law is not going to continue in any meaningful way without some serious post-transistor inventions. 
Processor speeds stopped growing 10 years ago. Multi-core processors can't go to more than handful of cores because all our software stack from OS to programming languages and legacy software was not designed for massive safe parallelization. To grow like in 20th century for another 50 years, we need to reinvent everything: CPU material, CPU architecture, OS design, programming languages, and rewrite all our software.

CT/BP will not inflate bitcoins. The way they are likely to be adopted is via a soft fork which allows every user to move cleartext coins to a special backwards-compatible cleartext output, which can only be spent if a correct "withdraw from CT" transaction is made. Both newer and older nodes will not allow inflation at this point as it's impossible to withdraw more than was deposited from these cleartext outputs.
This means two things:
1. A sudden QC attack would allow someone to claim all the coins moved to CT, effectively stealing from all CT users, but not inflating money supply. Note that sudden QC attack is likely to hurt in many more places, such as forging a software update and stealing your passwords and private keys, even if your pubkey is behind a hash in P2SH/P2PKH.
2. Only people who are willing to risk to put certain amount of coins into CT over a certain amount of time, would do so. Everyone else can happily keep hodling outside CT and/or use CT over shorter time intervals only to mix with other coins and then get back to cleartext ones.
What is more likely, is that QC attack perception will slowly change over time, and people can re-distribute their holdings over non-CT and CT outputs accordingly. If some day you personally calculate your risk of holding in CT output greater than a benefit, then you can move your coins out.

Thanks for answers. I thought OP_NOP is intended to remain "the NOP" for whatever purposes in the future, while OP_NOP{N} is to be redefined with new functionality. Since CLTV is to be enabled only after a certain block in the future, past uses of NOP1 should not make any difference. From an "elegance" standpoint, skipping NOP1 makes the whole solution a bit ugly.

Adding to what Andy replied already, and re-iterating what authors of BP were saying since publication:
Since it is pretty simply to create a single compressed BP over multiple parties' outputs, and the size grows ~~linearly~~ logarithmically, it incentivizes people to CoinJoin their transactions to achieve both better obfuscation, and save space. So if everyone casually merges at least two transactions in one (so that typical tx is not 2-in-2-out, but 4-in-4-out), then the overhead would be not even 4x, but just ≈2x. Of course, if you have a decent service or a p2p protocol for merging, you wouldn't stop at this and would merge many more transactions, reducing the space overhead of rangeproofs to a few percent.

Breadwallet's peers can withhold transactions and unspent outputs just the 3rd party server can. Except 3rd party server is public and liable and anonymous peers are not. Wallet can verify tx in themselves are correct no matter where they are coming from, so you can't lose money in either wallet.
From availability perspective, direct connections to peers is cool when your server goes offline. On the other hand, it's a less predictable environment which on mobile connection may be less stable than a fleet of commercial 3rd party frontends.

UA in UAHF makes no sense at all. It's just one miner doing an altcoin starting with a UTXO set at certain point in time. They don't even pretend that there's a lot of support for that hard fork - it's their own plan created after NY agreement, and not compatible with it.

Of course people investigate this problem and design solutions. But as of today, practical systems are not that scalable and functional programming is far from practical. Main reason being - there's no new hardware architecture widely deployed that will motivate people to learn, improve and actually use scalable techniques. Today you can write in Haskell or Lisp all you want, you will pay the price of inconvenience while getting very little benefit because the CPU and RAM are still old. So people don't and therefore these languages do not get friendlier and more convenient - no one to care about that if only current users are those who already enjoy the inconvenience and complexity.

All of your examples use "CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP". Why not include DROP into the operation? If in rare case people need the value to remain on stack, they'll add DUP first. Check-sig/multisig opcodes drop from the stack their inputs, so dropping the timestamp would make it consistent with them.

Smart contracts allow Alice and Bob trust each other directly based on the contract terms rather than trusting Carl to enforce contract and mediate conflicts. Which means that "classical" contracts always require some neutral trusted party to mediate the process and therefore create bureaucracy, friction and raise costs. E.g. when a trusted party fails, you have to go one level up to yet another trusted party and so on until you run out of time and money.
"Smart contracts" allow making enforcement "just work", so you can simply make it a part of your app and forget about all the unsolved problems of conflict resolution. Conflicts are getting resolved completely automatically. So you can move on and polish UI/UX.

Non-standard transactions are those that are valid, but will take much more to get mined (because few miners include non-standard transactions).
The purpose of "is standard" check is to limit exposure of everyone to all sorts of weird scripts that might by accident expose some bug in Bitcoin implementations.
P2SH is a way to wrap your complex script into a single compact address (starts with 3 while classic addresses start with 1). When spending from such address, one needs not only to provide input data (such as signatures), but also the original complex script that is hashed into address. 
Core 0.10 now allows many more kinds of such scripts to pass "is standard" check. So if you need some fancy new kind of contract or withdrawal condition, you can wrap it in P2SH address and it'll be relayed and mined without much delay.

We know that certain scripts are widely used and have little room to exploit the system. E.g. limited number of opcodes is used, or data is of limited length, or else. Some opcode or combinations of them are rarely used and may potentially touch some hidden bugs in the system leading to a network-wide denial of service or fork, or something else. Therefore, nodes prefer to relay only a certain subset of well-known "safe" scripts. So in case some vulnerability is discovered, people won't be able to mine thousands of transactions exploiting it right away.

Subsidy is the same for all miners and priced in their costs. Latency, however, is dynamic and individual. Each miner will try to optimise his revenue by reducing latency and including as many paid transactions as possible. Especially when reward halves again in 3 years and Bitcoin is used as heavily as Paypal with Western Union combined. Fees will be no less than 10% of the total reward in 3 to 5 years.

Well, Bitcoin does not need endorsement from any state. It is only valuable in proportion to real businesses accepting bitcoin (no matter who owns them). Strictly speaking, what matters is number of hands willing to hold bitcoins. Accepting them as a payment is a form of balanced investment (you "invest" in BTC by selling your services in proportion to BTC holders willing to spend them). If only 1% buys with BTC, your investment is 1% in BTC, 99% in CNY which sounds reasonable.

Bitcoin Central are great guys. I've purchased some bitcoins from them last December when I learned that they got some official deal with a registered payment processor (Aqoba). Before moving in more than 50 EUR, I've visited their office and had a lunch with them. All three key persons (David François - "davout" on bitcointalk, Pierre Noizat (CEO) and Gonzague Grandval) are very enthusiastic and serious about Bitcoin, but also very cautious and knowledgeable. Comparing to what I heard about MtGox, these guys were handling all issues pretty good.

Bitcoin isn't either until it's in everyone's hands. We still have a lot of people who didn't hear about it, but once they hear, will invest. Only when everyone who wants to invest, does so and information about Bitcoin has reached every prospective investor, then the price can be stable and change slowly according to overall productivity in the global economy.

I wasn't saying that at all. For purposes of mining, that is finding very specific partial collision of double-SHA256 it is pretty safe. We could also use double MD5 and it'd be safe as well (but it's shorter, so less room for the growth of difficulty).

Your comment on  is incorrect. Mining or producing anything does not create demand. People do work in expectation of demand, or driven by demand, but this does not create any new demand by itself. Maybe speculators think that difficulty indicates some future of Litecoin and thus invest in it? Maybe, but it's a circular logic (or a classic pyramid): because miners mine this stuff because they expect speculators to pay for their work for some reason. Circular relationship of cause and effect is not sustainable. 
As I explained in a comment below, security of blockchain is ultimately based on cost of hashrate. The costlier - the higher the barrier for an attacker to gain x% of hashrate and reverse some transactions. Litecoin does not have millions invested in ASICs, like in BTC, so it's not that costly to reverse txs. Of course, I don't really believe in effectiveness of any 51% attack, both on LTC or BTC, but we are talking about what LTC advocates *claim*, not what might or not happen. Their claim is incorrect and those who know that are liars.
"look at any other currency system, and then an alternative that also exists in the market."
On gold standard all currencies were just names of amounts of silver or gold. That's it. The name had extra utility to quickly count the weight without using a balance, so it carried a premium price. But more or less, all currencies were "ounces" of the same money, no different monies.
Without gold standard, only government controls make people use local currencies instead of converging to the single one. In Russia, in 1990s USD was a default money. People were thinking and pricing in USD. But then capital controls became stronger, tax evasion harder and law mandated to price things in Rubles instead of foreign currency. It was made expensive to use USD daily. Though, now many Russians keep savings in USD and EUR thus putting a strong limit on inflation (which always tries to jump higher).

Low risk mutual funds exist only because there's no hard easy-to-store currency. People don't want to hold money in USD and having highly-manipulated gold elsewhere in some bank is no better than "low risk fund".
Low risk funds, currencies, gold and silver and not needed if you have Bitcoin. People will save money to build their own businesses and invest in high-risk, high-yield stuff they truly care about. Or simply crowdfund production of things directly (like with Pebble).

Block header is being "hashed" by miners by slightly changing its contents (there's a numeric field "nonce", just for that purpose) and computing SHA256(SHA256(block_header)). The resulting hash is interpreted as a big 256-bit integer and compared with a "target". If the resulted number is less than the "target", then the proof-of-work is considered done and block will be accepted by others. Being "less than the target" looks like "having enough zeroes in the beginning", that's why block hashes have a lot of zeroes. E.g. 
Now, the target is just another 256-bit number and the lower it gets, the lower probability to find the block. 
Difficulty is computed by dividing maximum (easiest) target hardcoded in all Bitcoin nodes by the current target. Difficulty = 2 means "it's twice as hard to find the proof-of-work than it can ever be". 
The target is adjusted every 2016 blocks based on how quick the previous 2016 blocks were created comparing to 2 week interval. If they were created 20% quicker, then the difficulty is increased by 20% and new target is computed out of it. New blocks not meeting this new target will not be accepted by other nodes.

Lets look at it this way: gold is a decentralised ledger just like Bitcoin. Gold, like Bitcoin, has value for your mom because there are millions of speculators who believe it has value (so she knows that she can sell her gold to anyone anytime for almost anything). The main differences are: gold can't be stolen by a virus (but can be denied by your account manager), you can't forget a password to your gold, but it is much more expensive to move and protect. I believe for all Bitcoin shortcomings we will have hundreds creative solutions, while gold will remain forever heavy and physical. So in the long-term combined costs and risks of handling Bitcoin will be equal or lower than those of gold. 
Now, if your mom decides where to put her savings, she will prefer the most secure, most marketable commodity. If she puts her money in gold, she won't be able to quickly sell 1% to buy something expensive and she will have to accept counterparty risk (someone will guard her gold). Bitcoin, however, gives her both instant marketability and high levels of security from many risks (assuming we have nice hardware wallets and such in the future). Why should she diversify even 10% of her savings in gold if Bitcoin has all upsides and no downsides?
In the short term, Bitcoin security is not perfect and it can't be said "it has no downsides comparing to gold", but I believe the market will work this out because every bitcoin holder wants Bitcoin to be super-secure and better than anything. Because that's what will increase its value in competition with fiat currencies, gold or whatever.

Sorry, I was not clear. Your own merkle tree is okay as is. I meant, that a "proof" of existence which the owner of the document should carry around may not only include a branch from your merkle tree (which ends with a transaction), but also include a merkle branch of that transaction itself up to the block header which actually has some POW and timestamp. Then, to make the proof completely autonomous (so that the guy who should verify it does not need to consult the blockchain himself), you need to add to your proof a year or two worth of blocks behind the given block header, to make the total POW convincing enough. 
So for a given document D, a proof P is a combination of:
1. Merkle branch in your own pool of document hashes ending with a bitcoin transaction.
2. Merkle branch of this transaction in a block ending with some block header.
3. Several thousands of block headers behind that block header to have big enough POW that is impossible to forge with currently available hashrate.
If all of this is given, the recipient of the proof does not need to check anything else. He'd just trust the proof.
However, there's a problem. Imagine you make a timestamping today. When you present this proof 5 years from now, maybe a small cluster of contemporary ASICs would be powerful enough to redo all this POW that is included in your original proof. For your proof to work, you'd need to show that it was actually a part of a main chain up to the current point. So you'll need to present all the block headers since your proof up to the fairly recent one. Essentially it means that your proof can never be written down once and be completely autonomous later. You'd always have to gather the latest blockchain to prove your proof was always a part of it. It's not a big deal, but at least now, when I wasted everyone's time here, we have a formal definition of what is required from the prover :-) In the end, it's pointless to include previous block headers "to increase POW" as I suggested. You just need to keep one block header and then each time you show your proof, you need to get the latest blockchain and show that this block header is a part of it.

I did rough estimation on year-by-year basis. I can imagine Bitcoin being spread 10x more in a year which moves us into $10K territory. Then, it must take some more time before reaching $100K as there isn't a lot of secure infrastructure for investors to keep their coins safe. This will take some time to achieve. To match gold, it'll need to spread a lot and also have some of the wealth in gold transferred into BTC. Very conservatively, I don't think this match will happen within 1 year, therefore 2 years lower limit. In 5 years I'm quite sure it will surpass gold in amount of wealth accumulated.

I don't know why your comment should be downvoted and reported. 
I say "fraudulent" because I see myself a lot of newbies who invest in altcoins because they heard these arguments which I consider invalid. If Bitcoin was also a fraud in my view, I'd write a warning on it as well to prevent people from losing money.
About distribution of early coins. The risk of them hitting the market and lowering prices is already reflected in the current price. Every well-known risk, concern or fear are always priced in. Price changes only when knowledge changes. E.g. some new problem is discovered, Silk Road is shut down, or more people learn about Bitcoin or existing investors learn that it's more important than they thought and invest more. 
When Satoshi dumps his coins, price will go down, but so what. Now even more people have coins and some more people will rush to buy cheaper coins - because fundamentally nothing has changed. And your major risk is not removed, so the price can be even higher. That's not a problem at all.

Nice try. But PaulKrugman's and Bitcoin's value is not in tossing them around. Speculative things get value because there are people willing to hold them for whatever reason. When a merchant sees enough people around him willing to hold Bitcoin in exchange for giving him what he needs to run his business, he will accept BTC from customers. Money does not really circulate, it always sits in someone's wallet providing a service called "being able to spend it anytime for whatever you want".

You are wrong. The pre-existing parts of the blockchain are hashes, timestamps and digital signatures. All previous "consensus" algorithms were based on implicit assumption of a single designer controlling the machines. Thus, each machine implicitly trust all others to supply more or less accurate information and the protocol only needed to correct for race conditions. There was never a system designed to withstand all sorts of active attackers where every single machine cannot trust anyone at all. 
If Bitcoin has any predecessors, those are not DB replication protocols or Digicash, but Bittorrent, Hashcash and RPOW — protocols designed with "trust no one and operate on the open network" assumption.
If you look at the blockchain as a consensus mechanism, then it's clear why it must have its own currency built in. To motivate people maintaining such system it must not rely on any external resources, but provide something of marketable value in itself. Everyone who tried to design reputation systems knows that those inevitable become a currency. Most people thought it is a bug, but in case of Bitcoin it's a feature: it allows to protect contracts by pure anonymous deposits, without any additional karma or reputation maintained by some additional ledger.

My idea is about the case when the contract is outside Bitcoin scripts or is really hard or expensive for a 3rd party to decide how much each side contributed in the contract. When someone shipped the good by mail, how anyone can trust some scan of a receipt? If the locked BTC is allowed to "go back automatically" after some timeout, it will be used to scam people right away. You send your iPod to me, I receive it and then simply wait till my money is unlocked.
About kickstarter: yes, it's possible to automatically return money (actually, not even lock) until the goal is met. The interesting point is how to insure that once the goal is met, the collector doesn't just run away with it. I was recently thinking on how to keep that full amount similarly insured as in 1-to-1 contract. So that shareholders can always keep by the balls anyone who takes a bite from the common fund and is about to expend it for one of the project's needs. This would be interesting to implement.

Bitcoin inflation is predictable and thus accounted for by speculators to some degree.
Interestingly, during summer 2011 bitcoin inflation was relatively much bigger (total liquid supply was at least 2-3 times smaller than today and daily additions were 2 times bigger) which is manifested in slow and steady price drop over several months: home GPU miners were cashing out while they could.
@_date: 2013-10-01 07:14:51
Another problem is that government money is never owned neither by you, nor by the bank. It's always an IOU from some state. When you have some pocket money, it does not matter much, but for millions of cash you are at big risk. That's why you'd want to diversify into all sorts of securities and stocks (gold/silver are not really different because they are still stored by some third party somewhere, not in your office's basement).
Bitcoin is hard to compare and evaluate precisely because you can securely *own* it for real: have with you, move it around and pay the bills any time you want. We still need to develop easier and safer software, hardware and handling practices to facilitate that, but it will be done and then you will not need a 3rd party to store your millions. You will be your own bank.
So the difference is not quantitative ("cheaper"), but qualitative ("you can do things you just couldn't before"). Once you get the promise, you will value classical services requiring a lot of trust much-much less. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 20:47:09
Yeah, to bruteforce 256 bits would require much bigger amount of energy beyond what we have in the entire solar system. But we also need some amount of truly random bits to have unique hashes (otherwise we'd have several blocks with the same hash which is bearable, but requires additional changes in software and extra care).
Thankfully, 128 bits is considered unique enough (GUIDs/UUIDs are 128-bit numbers), so even if half of the SHA-256 is zeroed, we have plenty of bits for having unique hashes. But again, finding even 128 zero bits is beyond imaginable. 
Today we have something like 56 zero bits. Every additional bit increases difficulty by a factor of 2. So ten more bits will become zero when the whole network becomes 1024 times more powerful. To reach 128 zero bits we need 72 more bits. That's like 4 million trillion times bigger hashrate than today. 
In my opinion, bitcoin mining will stop growing rapidly when bitcoin usage hits saturation in major markets and its purchasing power stabilizes. Then BTC will slowly appreciate/depreciate in sync with the global economy performance and mining will hit technological limits and evolve slowly as well. This stabilization might happen within 20-50 years and I don't expect the hashrate to become more than million times the current value (just like I don't expect bitcoin to be worth much more than 1M times more than today). So, conservatively, if BTC and hashrate grow 10^9 times more, it'll add only 30 zero bits to the current 56 and leave 170 random bits for unique identification of blocks.
PS. Also, if/when someone finds some partial weakness in double SHA-256 and reduces the overhead of hashing by a whopping factor of 1000, it'll only add 10 more zero bits, not a big deal. In case the weakness is very bad, we'll just switch to 1024 rounds of SHA-256 per hash (to keep all ASIC owners happy) or SHA-3 (if SHA-256 is broken beyond all recovery).

In your current scheme the document carries around a branch from your merkle tree. You should simply extend this branch by a branch of transactions in a block, up to the very block header. This way your document will be linked to the block header which contains actual timestamp and a proof of work.  
EDIT: the best would be to include 1 year of block headers before the root block header, so you don't even need to lookup the full blockchain to trust the timestamp. The amount of POW in 1 year chain will be enough to convince anyone that these timestamps were not forged.

Thanks, I looked through the paper. I don't see any dependency of security from the actual interval. 20 confirmations on 5-minute blocks will take the same amount of energy as 10 confirmations of 10-minute blocks (slightly more, in fact, because of more orphans, but that's not very important).
What I mean to say, security of your transaction depends on how much energy and time the attacker has to spend for a given amount. Both energy and time boil down to investment of money ($, EUR or BTC, whatever). If the total hashrate of Litecoin is simply cheaper than the total hashrate of Bitcoin, then all other things being equal, I can spend less money buying up FPGAs or GPUs to make X% attack on Litecoin than on Bitcoin. Block intervals and particular hash functions don't change the economics here. For Litecoin to be more protected it must be more expensive to mine (in terms of $/hour) than Bitcoin.

1. CoinJoin leaves a huge "laundering" transaction in the blockchain. This is against "anti-structuring" laws. My scheme leaves "normal" payment transactions, as usual as any other payment transaction.
2. CoinJoin requires a server that can be a honeypot with all but 10% of users being FBI's sockpuppets.

People sometimes trust licensed doctors without second thought exactly because of the regulations. There is very little competition in medical practice, it is very strictly regulated market, so essentially every doctor gives all the same "safe" "approved" recommendations and treatments. Not to mention that quality of medical education is questionable when people are not allowed to explore and experiment. There are a lot of terminally ill patients who would love to try experimental risky treatments, but they are not allowed to.
If you believe in science, you'd not blindly trust a piece of paper authorized by the vatican of science, you'd pass important information through second, third opinion and you'd want to try to understand your problem yourself. 
If the guy comes to coinmd.org for a second opinion, he then can discuss it with his personal doctor. If he is blindly acting upon it, it's the fault of all those regulators who create a tightly controlled uniform automated medical service. 
After all, on what grounds I should be banned from receiving an advice from anyone if you don't like it? Maybe I shouldn't be allowed to use Bitcoin because it attracts some criminals? Maybe I shouldn't be allowed uncensored internet access because some poor child may find some porn in it?

The limited resource is not space in the block, but the network latency which affects how much money miners lose on orphan blocks. Block limit currently is nominal. It will be raised as soon as people will start hitting it and raising fees will make bitcoin less useful. Miners are the ones most vested in the long-term value of Bitcoin (because building mining machines is much riskier than just buying bitcoins), so they will quickly adapt to a higher volume of transactions. When the network latency becomes an issue, miners will try to solve this too by having more direct and faster connections. This will be an arms race just like in HFT markets: people will cooperate to make sure they exchange information as fast as possible. Of course, some transactions will still be expensive (like micropayments), but those will be handled by services on top of Bitcoin, no problem.
As of fees, we only need a more flexible way to discover what's the minimum fee for a certain probability of inclusion in a block. Gavin is working on it already, as far as I know.

Current exponential growth will continue till 2050 provided the BTC purchasing power is expected to grow in the same way (or if we find new ridiculously cheap way to compute massive amounts of hashes). But even the most optimistic prognosis for BTC (that is, replacing all national currencies, silver and gold) puts purchasing power of 1 BTC somewhere in several millions (not billions) of today's dollars. Meaning, the value won't increase much more than 1 million times. As I show in my reply below, even if the hashrate grows 1 million million times, we are still in a very comfortable zone before reaching maximum difficulty. 
In any case it's not hard to fix mining rules without throwing away all ASICs to say, require 2^20 rounds of SHA256 computations per hash to adjust to increased difficulty and whatever weaknesses of SHA256 we'll exploit in the future. So I highly doubt anyone invested in BTC today and in the future would consider a "more advanced solution" instead of adapting existing one. Saying that, I acknowledge I'd like to have a more functional and less quirky scripting mechanism and other blows and whistles, but the "network effect" is what's important in the end of the day. We have to live with what we have and improve incrementally from there. Just like with TCP/IP, HTTP, human languages, programming languages etc. Bitcoin itself uses OpenSSL, C++ and other well-known technologies instead of rolling out something entirely new and shiny.

Good Bitcoin news have a delayed effect on price by a month or two. People who want to invest have to study hard WTF is that and how to store their coins safely. Bad news, however, allow existing bullish traders to sell off their coins to re-buy them at a lower price.

US gov already defaulted in 1971 ( and since then was simply bullying people around the globe to consume more of their debt. Issuing more debt to pay the interest is the definition of default. The only question is when all other countries will exit the game and those trillions of dollars will fly back into US destroying its economy. Gov, of course, will not allow greenbacks to enter its economy easily, but that would be another way to strangle itself, North Korea-style. People will not be allowed to export goods and no one would want to import goods for depreciating USD. What happens today in Argentina and other South American countries will at some point begin in US.

Money and communication tools have value in "network effect", so "the biggest one wins it all". MacBook has individual utility, but HTML has network utility. That's why we all converged to making sites in HTML and even ditching Flash Player in favor of extending HTML with more features.
You do need more than one bank because different banks have different risks and management people inside. For the same reason you'd put your bitcoins in different wallets - if one of them happens to be weak, you don't lose all your money.
There were TCP/IP, Xerox PARC network, AppleTalk, Minitel. Finally we invest in capital around TCP/IP because there's already a lot of capital around it to interact with.
Facebook is winning as the biggest "must have" one, but since the opportunity costs of joining alternative networks are almost zero (unlike saving money), there are also other websites where people share photos and personal stories.

I've improved their idea by having pure two-party contract, without any arbitrator. The idea is that both parties lock up in a single special transaction 200% of value in question. If you want to sell me iPod for $100 and I need to pay you via wire transfer, each of us should lock up $200 or more in a single transaction. Then, for both of us it's highly risky to try play in extortion. It's much cheaper to keep calm and stay by the contract. Both players will have a destruction transaction that blows up both deposits at once forever. 
More info here:
It works even better when both parties are not humans, but programs (that never negotiate). Imagine a P2P network of wallets that connect randomly to other wallets, establish such an insurance contract and then mix coins (testing statistics before accepting the trade). Coins are sent as simple payment transactions, so they are not linked in any way to each other and statistically look the same as any other payment on the blockchain. Cheating is prevented by having some bigger amount locked up until the mixing is over.

Stealing requires a lot more work than just to print stuff. Especially to steal bitcoins and not some physical stuff in your apartment. This will be a very powerful limit on what state can do. Today state extracts 50% of income via taxation and then even more via inflation. With bitcoin taxation will become much harder (block market will be much bigger and safer) and inflation is impossible. This will have very dramatic effect on the power of the state.

I say "fraudulent" because it's an information that is not true which is used to trick people into spending their money/time/energy.
Waiting 2.5 minutes for confirmation in Litecoin is arguably a good user experience. Also, there is a huge variation, like in Bitcoin. If you need an upper limit for 95% of payments, it'll be twice as much easily. Many users would have to wait 5 or more minutes and this affects perception of easy of use a lot. Also, today I would argue zero-conf transaction in BTC is super-fast (a lot of nodes) and very safe (a lot of nodes). Waiting 5 seconds to notice any double spend attempts on BTC network is more convenient and as secure or more than in Litecoin with 1 confirmation. And certainly, zero-conf in BTC is much more secure than in LTC zero-conf.
LTC being traded on major exchanges could be an indicator of demand, or can be done "just because" (since the code to support it does not need to be significantly changed). The only good indicator - how may people are willing to hold it long-term. And that decision depends on how many other people make the same bet. We all want to converge on one, most liquid asset (that's the whole point of having money anyway!). If that's BTC, then there is no place for LTC. If that's LTC, there's no point in BTC. So far BTC is so far away in adoption from LTC, I don't think LTC has any chance. It's merit is no bigger than in BTC, so technical ("intrinsic") superiority is not a factor at all.

Arguments for Litecoin are fraudulent. 
TL;DR: there's no important difference between LTC and BTC and only one of them can win over another because, other things being equal, which they are, people want to invest in the most liquid money (with the biggest number of folks willing to hold it). LTC can't be "silver", because both LTC and BTC have exactly the same risks and costs. Either LTC wins over BTC, or BTC over LTC.
I'll elaborate.
Litecoin/Bitcoin/Shitcoin are all long-term bets. I myself don't speculate on daily basis, most of us bet for some future value of these things in the multi-year time frame. So let's focus on that.
1. In long term security is not measured in "block interval time" or number of blocks. It's measured in amount of money to be spent on double spending. Today hashrate of Bitcoin is many-many times more expensive than that of Litecoin. So one block confirmation in Litecoin is not just 4x less secure, but hundreds times less secure: you need smaller investment to fork the chain, than with BTC. So anyone who brings up security argument is lying to you.
2. Litecoin is not "faster" either. For the same level of security as in BTC, you have to wait hundred times longer (see  Instant transactions are the same and also less secure than in BTC: zero-conf, with less nodes and less connectivity between them to limit double-spend attempts. Anyone bragging about "LTC being faster" is a liar. It can only be slower due to less number of nodes and currently lower hashrate, not faster. LTC can only be faster if BTC is being abandoned and people switch to LTC.
3. "Scrypt protecting against concentration of power due to ASICs" is bullshit. If LTC wins over BTC, there will be ASICs and whole factories making chips and plugging them in on-site right away. Just like it will be with BTC or ShitCoin or else. Long-term LTC is either dead or is full of chinese ASICs, like BTC. Anyone arguing otherwise is a liar.
4. "Scrypt more secure than SHA256" is bullshit in the context of mining. If there's a better optimization in SHA256, it'll be like a better hardware. But this can equally happen to Salsa in Scrypt too. If the breakthrough is significant, all BTC stakeholders will vote for adjusting the protocol to fix the problem, not lose everything by panic selling. Huge price of BTC is a great motivator to find the weakness in double-round SHA256 and mine faster. Every day it doesn't happen is only a practical proof it's as good as it can be (just like Scrypt, double MD5 or whatever), everything else is unfounded FUD.
5. "More fair distribution of wealth" - this is unfounded FUD. For average Joe, LTC is less widely accepted, so its concentration, however "fair" it was, is still higher than in BTC. And who knows how much of early mined BTC are lost forever (we know that's a lot) or were sold during 2011 bubble and slow price rundown the same year. I bet very few were sticking to their holdings that time. 
6. "Diversification" (based on all points above) - newbies who don't know economics are made to think they diversify by investing in some altcoins. But the risks and costs are all the same for all coins. If Bitcoin is completely broken, most likely altcoins are broken for the very same reason. Otherwise, all Bitcoin holders will simply agree to upgrade the protocol. Especially so as Litecoin is on the same codebase. 
The only real argument about LTC and BTC is that there's no functional difference between them. LTC could only be 4+ times costlier to miners due to faster blocks and more "decentralization" of individual miners (slower connectivity, faster blocks =&gt; more orphans). If LTC was released before BTC and took off, everyone would be using LTC no problem. The only thing that matters here is liquidity, number of holders of money. If people are betting it is BTC with more hands, they send a signal to others about that by holding too. This moves all the "cryptoinvestments" into BTC in long term. If people see that LTC is gaining more hands, then everyone will converge on LTC. LTC and BTC cannot coexist together, it makes no economic sense both for miners (who want to invest 100% in the most valuable currency in long term) and for users (who want money only because it's widely exchangable for many goods at any later dates).
Right now there's a lot of excitement about Bitcoin and not many people understand economics. Some folks are lied to and "diversify" into altcoins, which gives them short-term bubble. But in years to come, when they see, that Bitcoin has bigger adoption, they'll move their savings to BTC and then all altcoins will crash. Or for some mysterious reason BTC will not be viable and people jump to LTC en masse.

It's kinda applicable to Bitcoin too because a database of "bad coins" is subjectively defined and there could be many of them. Just like with cash, merchants would have little idea which database to trust and who the judges are. Or, if the government defines such a database, it'll be exactly like with cash. Merchants will never be sure if they are accepting coins with the most recent knowledge of which coins are stolen. And if later, down the road some coins turn out to be "bad" and some merchants possess portions of them, it'll render their cash holdings less valuable.
Basically, any kind of enforced cash-marking is equivalent to restriction on accepting that money completely. 
However, if government starts a war on Bitcoin, it will become even more expensive. Like with drugs. Or, check how much more bitcoins are expensive in Argentina where the war is on every currency, including local one (via inflation).
