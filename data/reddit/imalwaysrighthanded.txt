I want a coin star machine that turns your change into bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-16 13:47:45
Pull the same stunt they did in 1931 and demand you turn in your bitcoin or else face prosecution if caught? I guess that’s just for Americans.

Don’t be worried, be happy and buy buy buy if it happens to fall lower.

Are there even enough available bitcoins to allow a whole population to own there wealth in bitcoin alone? I don’t think so, maybe if bitcoin was worth millions per coin

If I don’t keep at least $1500 in Chase they charge me around $15 per month. Such bs to essentially charge the poor that much of a percentage of there savings per month.
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:29:35
My account is zero fees * just got to do direct deposit or keep $1500 in the account. I learned from experience.  Just funny how I don’t pay a fee for 10 plus years then I let the account get low and then you charge the “poor” guy like 10% of his saving per year.
@_date: 2019-07-13 03:29:59

I look at my full change jar and think how I could turn every penny into damn near 100 satoshi’s

@_date: 2019-07-08 14:42:56

People hate on Coinbase but it’s as easy as buying something off amazon. Sure the first time it may take 5 days for your money to clear but in that time the price may go up or down and you have time to think if you really want to buy or not. After my money cleared I waited 19 more days to buy at the price I wanted.
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:43:54
I didn’t put it all on one dog tag and I got them on different days.  Half one day the other half another. I also logged in and paid with my credit card and the next day I used my gf credit card and her info to pay for the kiosks
 
My thinking is the dog tags will be better Incase of a house fire.

Yup. Chase wouldn’t even let me withdraw $6700 cash. I wanted to buy a car. They gave me $3000 and told me to go to another branch.

Psh I wouldn’t even wipe my ass with that. Got to at least use $10000 bill for the right feel.
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:21:31
Chase in Florida. Another time I pulled out $7000 for a car and they gave me grief about it saying I should call ahead if I need a lot of cash. I understand over $10000 but anything under just hand it over,  it’s less than 100 bills that’s pocket money to some people.
@_date: 2019-08-14 15:28:03

Can’t wait for the days so many people want bitcoin it will be difficult to replenish what you spend so easily

That’s when I started watching bitcoin at $40-$100. Watched it soar to $1000 and thought I missed the boat, it dropped down to the $300 area and instead of going to the casino with a pocket full of cash I bought bitcoin with it. I feel like I’ve been at the casino for 4 years now.
@_date: 2019-08-13 01:55:30

@_date: 2019-02-21 11:33:39
Exactly $3500 is basically 35 bills. If I asked for say $35000 I can understand to call ahead but still that’s only 350 bills, still not that much. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:53:58
Also if the price of bitcoin keeps going up then the meal would cost less satoshi’s by the end of the meal...
@_date: 2019-06-19 17:14:02

Let me tell you how far a dollar gets you. I have a car wash membership and so does my gf I always tip a dollar or 2 when I go threw the car wash. The attendants not only remember me but the attack my car and basically wash the front end before I enter the machine. My gf saw this and said they don’t do that for me. I also tip my local deli, when I walk in the workers see me and start my order right away it saves time and everybody is happy. If you can’t afford to do this then don’t but if you can it’s a great life style.

I knew the bank was broken when I wanted to buy a car with cash $6500 to be exact. They did not let me pull out 65 measly $10O bills.  They gave me $3000 in cash and told me to go to another branch.  So I actually would like to thank the bank because I bought bitcoin shortly after that
@_date: 2019-10-27 13:49:17

@_date: 2019-02-21 11:26:20
No I did not but I would thInk maybe after 200 hundreds maybe you need to call ahead. I wanted $6500 to buy a car cash off Craigslist. I couldn’t belive they wouldn’t give me essentially one pocket full of cash. I wanted 65 pieces of paper from them and they put up a stink, that’s wrong.

There excuse was they had no where to store it. Bail was only $500 so about 50 quarter rolls

Same here

About 100 quadrillion dollars but I want them in trillion dollar bills. Pretty sure I could get $1 or more on eBay for every bill.

I would think any respectable business would give a discount for using bitcoin. Shame on you.
@_date: 2019-09-24 12:45:03
If you can’t give a 20% discount to the few bitcoin users that buy from you and all your employees who purchase from you without losing money I think you need to rethink your business venture.
Oh how on earth will I ever change these bitcoin to cash to buy more goods? Cmon you know how to do that.

Usually at least 100% markup if not 500% on goods sold at retail.

In Martin county people paint small rocks and leave them somewhere in public for kids to find, the kids absolutely love it when they find one.

Happened in 1999, do you have a lawyer who will take my case? /s

If you were talking about the gas station not accepting it then that was because at night they only keep $50 in the register and her register was filling up with quarters and no paper money after a few people paid with them after pumping. So if anyone needed to break a bill to buy something the cashier would have to give them there change back in all quarters.

When I’m up 100x I’ll pull out a little, until then I feel like I’m at the casino watching the roulette wheel turn with thousands riding on it. I quit gambling, this bitcoin ride has fully replaced it.

I know someone who bought 1/10 at $16500 and didn’t buy anymore because they were sickened with the whole thing. I think he’s still holding so he’s got that going for him at least.

I heard that as Ryan from the office, like when he’s pitching wulf.com.

I prefer to plug it, no ugly snorting throughout the night.

As of now I have more cash than bitcoin but I plan on that dynamic shifting without me even buying anymore bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:10:09
My story is very similar to you as I held threw thick and thin. I liked going to the casinos so instead of one night I bought bitcoins, luckily this was in 2015 my account went from $1100-$80000 down to 13000and back to $30000. These last few years have been better than any night at the casino.  Thank you pilot Dave for getting me into this.
@_date: 2019-05-19 01:02:41
I plan on never getting a real job again and selling my coins to my friends and family and living off the grid, FOREVER. Viva la bitcoin.

If I die some lucky soul will find mine. Who knows if they will know what to do with them? One of my brothers knows but who knows if he committed what I said to memory.

I’d rather die hundreds of thousands in debt than have several thousand to my name.

You will have the same amount of bitcoin.

Might as well interview anyone who bought a new car in 1960. Wow look at this chevelle they bought for only $2200

He did a bankruptcy like trump did, to minimize your losses.  Not because he went belly up knucklehead.
