We are focusing on two different properties. Bitcoin as a non counterfeitable store of value is more important than its anonymity. If all it took was anonymity to end Central Banks, we could all just use gold. They did use gold for many years, but it did not stop them. Gold also gave rise to highwaymen, pirates, and privateers because it is fungible. I'm not saying there shouldn't be some degree of fungibility, but not at the risk of increased violence or we are no better than the Central Banks.

You sacrifice counterparty risk for flexibility. Colored coins allow you to create a currency "backed" by any asset you offer. In this case, say you create an original work of digital art. You can use the art to generate a bitcoin address this way. You then release a compressed version of the art for distribution and a colored coin as a certificate of authenticity. With epobc in Chromawallet, you may only generate a color one time and may not generate the same color at another time, even with the same hash or key. So while you can prove you funded the colored coin, you can't counterfeit or "inflate" them.

There would need to be a central authority that has wallet verification codes. Let's say a billion or so just to be safe.

1. Your wallet would reject coins that are not whitelisted. The sender's wallet would not allow such coins to be sent until they go through a clearance process that determines their origin. They could have a 20 year statute of limitations or some such penalty for non-compliance.
2. Personally, I don't think Bitcoin itself will be used as a global end-user currency, but if it is, then coins will have to be cleared as part of an entry visa process.
3. I addressed that in the OP. Limits to paper currency technology make such law enforcement procedures ineffective. YMMV.

All I'm saying is that the IPO is a bad analogy. Unlike most startups, Bitcoin can't fail. It is a grass-roots, open-source, disruptive-technology movement. It's not a business. For the first year or so it had no measurable value and  no venture capital. It didn't need it then and it doesn't need it now. Most of the "expedited" development is coming from unpaid volunteers because the VC backed developers are mostly trying to make a quick buck by stealing Bitcoin's thunder.

Because you have the original, you can create another hash. I'm not a cryptography expert, but there is supposed to be a way to prove that you are using the same elliptic-curve function. IIRC it's similar to how multisignature public keys are generated so that you can use a subset of signatures to solve the key.

Many of them. Let's start with the first one. Buyer suffers loss when an exchange is fraudulent. Caveat Emptor. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Higher risk yields higher gains and losses. There are ways to reduce or eliminate the threat of fraud on an exchange through multisignature transactions or escrow, though you may possibly need to trust a third party. Wall Street brokers frequently defraud their customers. Bitcoin is very low risk compared to them rascals that have stolen trillions over the years. I would call that a feature.
Ok the second one is a little trickier. Losing when an exchange is not genuine. I'm not sure what they mean by this, but I'm pretty sure that all Bitcoin exchanges are equally non genuine. Case in point: Mt Gox. It's a little fuzzy, so lets call it a feature.

Historically, keeping financial history anonymous requires fraudulent paperwork and is used to hide crimes. Most crimes are a result of mental illness.

1. Yes it would be like PayPal sans identity theft. I am toying around the idea of a deterministic whitelist. It would make the verification process portable. You could shop around for the best verification rates or use it to migrate a wallet to another country and no longer be traceable by that country or previous whitelisting service. If they become corrupt, just stop using them. Either get a new list of verifications or a new seed or if it's possible to create a deterministic whitelist, move all your outputs using a whitelisted mixing service to a new deterministic wallet. Confused? It has my head spinning with the possibilities. I wish the black hats would be working on these ideas instead of me.
2. When you travel, you currently declare how much cash you have. The current state of Bitcoin will be stopped by states if it is shown that they are used for serial or mass murder. You will then use the accepted state sanctioned cryptocurrency of that country. It will probably be a PoS and require an exchange through a sanctioned broker. Sending Bitcoin around the world will only be done through licensed brokers. This will lead to Bitcoin becoming the Global Reserve Currency like the IMF uses the SDR, but not usable by consumers.
3. Let me add that I don't think paper money will go away for a long time. It will probably be limited to use as tokens for basic survival such as food, transportation, and beer.

Yeah, I get that a lot. People think they can stop hackers from pirating with complex and expensive copy protection and DRM. Owning a proof of authenticity just shows you didn't pirate it like everyone else. Call it conspicuous consumption, bragging rights, or just showing support for the artist. If the art becomes viral, the coin itself will go up in value. It doesn't cost the artist anything to provide it. This is one of those open source paradigm shifts people will need to move forward with this technology. Using colored coin (or some other Bitcoin 2.0 format) to do this makes it universal.

If this is for your wife, I might put passphrases to BIP38 keys in the will in a safe deposit box. The passphrases could be disguised as last wishes so a judge won't blackmail her. Tell her ahead of time about them. She will have to understand that not giving her access to it is for her protection.
In the event that she dies with you, I would also create Shamir's Secret Sharing of keys that unlock a file stored in the safe with the instructions of what you and her know. Give those keys as a m of n to people you also name in your will for one dollar and the file stored on a disk or thumb drive stored in the safe. She would otherwise have accessed the safe before the will is read through a locksmith service and will see instructions on the file storage for her to destroy it immediately. 
I don't know any other way to do this without trusting  probate court, which I don't.

It's not important who is selling, but how low they are willing to go.

Future Headline: NASDAQ Bitcoin Exchange Hacked!
Core technology my arse. If they aren't using Bitcoin technology, then it won't be secure.

Every person has there own personal Hype Cycle. The trick is to see past your own foibles. To see cycles in markets is an illusion of the pattern seeking brain.

Let me clarify this. Inflation is asymptotic. If Bitcoin remains divisible to only 8 decimal places, then inflation will end in about 2140. So if you plan to retire in 2140, then you will have a deflationary asset to spend or not depending on your financial philosophy.

You can call it inflation I call it systematic theft. You can call it deflation, I call it saving for the future. Fiat economics boils down to systematic theft of future savings.

IBM will develop an ASIC for ethereum and license it to central banks.

First of all, centralized exchanges need to divorce themselves from libertarian ideologies and be subject to very high regulation. They should only be accessible to licensed and bonded brokers.
DEXs can be developed for libertarian traders. They will serve as arbitrage between central exchanges and after hour trading. They will use licensed colored coin fiat currencies to trade cryptocurrency pairs.
This will solve many of the problems with volatility and security. First we need to shut down the central exchanges until they are licensed. Then the regulators need to approve central banks to issue fiat backed colored coins of universally accepted Bitcoin 2.0 protocols.

Why can't you do both? If you are living paycheck to paycheck, you shouldn't be speculating, period. Otherwise, spend and replace at the current value so you maintain your holding at a comfortable level.

Adding decimal places does not add to the money supply!
Because the inflation function is mathematically asymptotic, reaching the last unit would in fact extend money supply well past 2140 if decimal places were added, but would not add to money supply. I used Zeno's Paradox as an example of reaching the end of the 21M units.

If you care about money, don't get married.

By your logic as long as spending was more than 10% of the previous year, that means people are spending more bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-02-01 00:46:21
Start by making a title like "84% of bitcoins are in circulation."
@_date: 2015-02-01 12:40:48
Good, because I never implied such an argument.

I can almost hear the NSA chuckle.
