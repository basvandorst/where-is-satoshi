Doesnt that depend on where you live and how old you are when you retire?
I would guess that, lets say in ethiopia you can retire with less funds then for example in monacco.

Damn! We will loose 10k!!! And then it will go down all the way to 3k!!1!!!1111!!
Sell if you value your life!!1!1!
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:38:59
So what? 5k is still a lot of money for a bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:44:05
I think you give too much importance to the influence of this Reddit....
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:13:19
I know what will happen if I try to use that pattern...
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:06:10
This is it. Bull market is over. Now it's going down all the way to -3000...

The November 2020 forecast makes me a bit nervous...
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:00:01
Why didn't you wait? Chzances are good, that in the near future you will get a Bitcoin for half what you paid now...
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:29:08
Zero marks the bottom
@_date: 2019-11-05 21:01:27
No it's not.
@_date: 2019-11-05 18:05:02
Most likely fake news
@_date: 2019-08-06 11:29:37
Aaannnd it's gone...
@_date: 2019-08-12 11:10:35
Well, If I had 1000th of BTC I would dump a good part of them for sure. Why hold them?
@_date: 2019-08-02 15:29:35
Interesting can go both ways...
@_date: 2019-10-04 20:56:09
But ledgers network could be hacked. And then an attacker could compromise the update server.
Not very likely, but not impossible either. There is no 100% security. Never.
@_date: 2019-08-18 19:58:06
This looks ... Impressive... Will sell everything I own for BTC now.
@_date: 2019-10-29 17:48:08
The actual chart from bittrex?
@_date: 2019-08-08 06:01:35
Yeah. Because everyone knows, that Linux is 110% safe and has no security vulnerabilities at all.
And a Linux user, of course, cannot be tricked into clicking a malicious link.

And if you slice it up into infinite parts than you can feed the whole world with one pizza !!!!!!!!!!1!1!1!1!

All these conspiracy theories...
@_date: 2019-06-04 08:53:40
I read it in my turd this morning...
@_date: 2019-02-20 05:16:25
Which vision? I currently think this is just another bounce with a further drop coming.
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:29:57
Going down to 3k!!!1!!1!
@_date: 2019-02-19 14:52:45
I will hope that this is a bull run when bitcoin breaks 6k. And I will believe it once it breaks 9k...
@_date: 2019-06-04 07:29:35
3000$ here we come

Chuck Norris knows the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto...
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:17:09
But why buy such a huge amount over the exchanges? Wouldn't it be much wider for the buyer to use otc trading to accumulate such a huge amount without influencing the price such much?
@_date: 2018-11-30 05:17:01
Lol. As a german i see putin as some kind of mafia don.
And trump like some kind of spoiled kindergarten child.
Both pretty bad if you ask me.
@_date: 2018-11-24 09:02:14
Bottom is 0 for sure. But bitcoin is worth what people are willing to pay for it...
@_date: 2018-11-12 08:32:09
Sooner or later the world will end...
@_date: 2019-01-23 09:21:41
Or IT might Buy Me a pizza...
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:22:02
Lets talk again tomorrow...
@_date: 2019-09-17 15:29:25
Price will either rise, fall or stay the same. Now prove me wrong...
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:25:53
Too late now, but why did you leave that much money on an external wallet?
@_date: 2019-09-08 10:08:29
It will either break through or not...
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:59:25
Playing the devils advocate here: What if someone finds a fatal security design flaw in Bitcoin? 
Unlikely after all the years, but not impossible.
O rwe get real  Quantum Computers able to break Bitcoins encryption?
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:23:06
I prefer a beer market then...
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:34:46
75% bitcoin for me. But I'm getting a bit afraid with the current surge...
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:08:21
Proof please...
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:55:23
And that makes it a scam ( how?
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:01:16
Hanging around 8000$ for 24 hours now. Whats up? Bear market coming?
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:33:10
So, is bitcoin going to fall?
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:44:14
But do they have bears at a beer market?
@_date: 2019-05-28 14:40:46
Below zero!!! Negative bitcoin!! Like negative interests!!
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:27:46
Nobody knows...
I find this rise a bit fearsome...
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:57:11
