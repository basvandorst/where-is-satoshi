Every netcafe near me had these things running constantly back then.

All praise to the mighty Bitcoin.

This is what I've been thinking.  I only started mining last week and I've barely made anything, I wanted to buy a new GPU but now I realize if I'm going to spend a few hundred bucks, I might as well just put that into the market when it hits a low point and start trading.  Will definitely make more money that way.

Kind of, it depends on what learning algorithm you use for the NNs.  The 'textbook' learning algorithm is called backpropagation, which is basically a hill climbing algorithm.  It's very possible (and highly effective) to use a GA as the NN learning algorithm, and lots of research has been done in this field.

Another one of my favourites was the team using a GA to program a large robotic dragonfly to learn to 'fly'.  It was several feet long, had hard wings, and was mounted on a vertical shaft to keep it from falling over.  They started it off flapping randomly and the fitness function was its total height off the ground.  They came back the next morning to find it perfectly still, standing on the ends of both wings.  Talk about a local maximum ;)

Quick question, in your GA do you consider delta fitness in addition to absolute fitness?  I found rewarding a certain percentage of the population based strictly on their delta fitness helped 'rising stars' with a low fitness relative to the population continue to evolve and possibly contribute to the overall population success, as well as help leap over local maxima.

Always be scared when it comes to where your bitcoins are stored.
