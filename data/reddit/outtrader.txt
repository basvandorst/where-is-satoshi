I'm trying to look at Bitcoin as a currency and try to understand the effects of demand and supply on the currency. For example IMO as acceptance of bitcoin increases, demand for the currency should increase. Another facilitator of demand would be technological advances that face the end user (consumer), as it becomes easier to find and use bitcoin, demand should increase. One more point could be trust to the currency, which I believe would create a multiplier effect; increased usage would bring trust, which should create a positive feedback loop (IMO gives a reason to be bullish on BTC).
On the other hand we have supply side; people investing in miners, miners coming up with new chunks of coins etc. It feels like the downward trend is happening because of the current imbalance between money creation and supply. Because of the hype, we saw overinvestment to miners, which created a supply that cannot be (viable, economically) used. 
These are theories that I came up with, not sure how to validate or test these. Actually I'm not exactly looking for "trade tips" but people that I can discuss these kinds of ideas, help me validate my ideas etc.

I started using tradingview.com if you guys are interested there are some traders with many interesting ideas over there. Main problem with tradingview is that it's way too technical, most of the analyst talk is around "heads and shoulders" "technical analysis" etc, I'm looking for some sensible / real life analysis that focuses on long term position on Bitcoin.
