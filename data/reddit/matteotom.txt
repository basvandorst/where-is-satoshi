It is similar to tor, except for a few key differences.  First, exit nodes are not supported by default (although it is possible).  Second, while it is secure, it is not completely anonymous, meaning if somebody really wanted they could figure out who you are.
As far as I understand it, tor is designed to run over the current internet to provide anonymity.  CJDNS, on the other hand, is a piece of software that can run on top of the current internet, like tor, or replace it by routing the traffic between wireless "nodes".
You could run CJDNS on your (linux) computer right now, and access the CJDNS network (called "hyperboria").  The router we are offering if you donate &gt;$125 will run CJDNS, so theoretically the devices that connect to it could connect to hyperboria without running CJDNS.

I don't think so.
At least not from amazon

We already have quite a few people who sit on our channel all day.  It's only one more network to add, which shouldn't be too difficult.
And as thefinn93 said, this decision was made a while ago, and it would be unpractical to change now.

Are transaction fees mandatory?  I was under the impression that they were optional.
Ninja edit:  If they are mandatory, couldn't that cause less trading, further hurting the value of a bitcoin?

Well, they can try
And when they do, it will lend credibility to bitcoin.

I was referring to CJDNS.  Everything is encrypted from end to end, but somebody could figure out who you are if they were dedicated enough.  
Therefore, secure but not completely anonymous.

I've been involved with this for a while (bentley over on IRC if you are curious), so I will do my best to answer some of your questions:


This means actually porting cjdns to windows.  We estimate that it will take quite some time, so the goal is $3500 to develop full windows support.


This is mostly correct.  Depending on how we set it up, it may require you to visit IRC and ask for connection information from a few people.


Yes, at least until we have Windows support finished.


Yes, see above


Somebody may have, but I have not personally looked into it.  It's a good idea though!


Hyperboria is our name for the network that is formed by computers connected via cjdns.  We currently have a reddit clone, a social network type site, IRC servers, and more.  
I am not qualified to speak on how well it will scale, but I'm sure somebody on IRC could help answer that.


We have at least one link up here in Seattle so far, with many more planned this summer.
Thanks for your interest!

First, CJDNS (the software we use for routing) encrypts everything from one end to the other, making it different from current internet technologies.
Second, we are currently relying on telecoms for internet access at the moment, but we are working towards building our own wireless networks.  Here in Seattle, we have at least three nodes with one active link, and plans to set up many more this summer.

Well, it would help us with testing.  Each person that runs it make the network one node better.  
In addition, you could access hyperboria services through it with some clever proxying, if you really wanted to.

[The Github page]( has instructions to install on Ubuntu, which should translate almost exactly to Debian.  The main gist of it is:
Clone the repo  
run ./do  
create a configuration file  
ask for peering info from people physically nearby through IRC  
add that info, and fire it up!
And I think somebody made a Debian init script, somebody probably knows more if you ask in IRC.

In the words of Dan68 (unofficial leader of the Seattle Meshnet Project): "EFnet is a federation, Freenode is a dictatorship"
I don't have much of an idea about what he means by that either.
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:30:32
OK, that makes sense.

One of the biggest problems I see is that it is bound to start deflating once we hit the 21million point, and when a currency starts deflating people will not have much incentive to not horde it (ie they will horde it, and not much investment will happen).

I just asked on IRC, and OSX is not officially supported, but it usually compiles.  I'd have to look around a bit to find instructions.
Github is here:
