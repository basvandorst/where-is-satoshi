Really we should just put this in the sidebar.

I could see that. BTC is actually great for "stupid" scams, like "Cruise for only 3 BTC, worth $15,000", then just taking the money, since you can't charge back.

Really, it's the right thing to do IMO. Suddenly that's $7,000 you didn't know you had, if they'd decided to keep it or even just not bother you wouldn't have even realized it existed.

Same as always. "Please send processing fee of 30 BTC to receive 50,000 BTC directly deposited from my kingdom/wealth/pirate treasure."

The problem though, is ease of use.  The rest of the currencies are very easy to use (you hand them USD/Gold/Corn, they hand you _____), but bitcoin lacks physical presence and is thus more complicated to use.

At the same time, it could be argued it has lesser utility, since if a disaster occured and the power grid was offline, BTC would be very difficult to transfer, giving it next to no value.

I like to mix chunks of things I already have memorized. My cars VIN, old credit card number, stuff like that. I just mix that stuff.

True, but so does USD, I rarely have to use physical cash at all.

True, but it undeniably has a large number of material uses (high conductivity, extremely low reactivity, low melting point, etc), whereas bitcoin has almost no physical uses as a digital currency.

I suppose it depends on your [definition]( but fiat money and fiat are two (slightly) different things.  A bank's note can be fiat currency, or even a check, technically.

I'm all for Bitcoin, but I fail to see how Bitcoin isn't a fiat currency. It has no intrinsic value, just like any other currency.
