This would be non-scalable when it comes to policing the Identity service. A black market in transactions from unregistered accounts would spring up.
Signed accounts might be targeted for identity theft and used to "wash" dirty funds. Micro payments from tainted accounts could be sent via such routes to "embarrass" sensitive wallet holders. The possibilities are endless.
Perhaps the Mafia is behind the idea? They recognise the need to create a highly regulated "legitimate" market in order to profit on the out-skirts and borders of such a system...

interesting. Would imply that the network must be able to provide proof of delivery before the client pays the sender.
Also requires that the receiver not conspire to deny reception to try to dodge payment...
its a bit like the database two-phase commit problem

Streuth! What a load of complication for a simple problem.
Your phone already has a means of securely sharing information that is far more convenient: the screen!
In fact, this might just be how Apple Passbook, and Bitcoin payment apps already work...

Your bullet list: "Why should I accept Bitcoin as a merchant?" is badly worded. The points must be the explicit benefits to the merchants, not just bunch of factoids.

Good post, but I think CoinValidation is actually more concerned with validating the wallet rather than the coins in it. It's more like requiring you to present your passport every time you make a cash purchase.

he didn't hand the gold back. He sent it on to an address provided, likely by email, which may or may not have been the purchaser. If he didn't want to be open to charges of money laundering, he just needed to verify his customer's address. If you don't believe in anti money laundering you might be happier in China or Russia...
