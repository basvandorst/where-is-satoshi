Yes, I chose the two line backup and used the root key for my two lines. I also have a chain code on my paper backup which is another 2 lines of random letters but I never used these for anything. Sound correct?

I must have chosen a backup type (not sure which one) because it created a wallet but there was 0 bitcoin and the wallet ID was different than the wallet ID on my paper backup? Is there a particular backup type I should have chosen?

What is the best way to restore? The computer he originally downloaded the Amory Wallet is gone. Should we just download a new Amory Wallet and restore? This is the best way? Don't need step by step instructions, just want to be pointed in the right direction. Thx.

I did a rebuild/rescan of Armory database but same thing happens. I says I have spendable bitcoin but the armorydb.exe crashes after trying to send. I noticed 2 error messages.
This error showed up after rebuilding/scanning database:
error - (..\bitcoin =p2p.cpp:1032) caught exception in processdatastackthread: invalid varint size
This error showed up after trying to sending bitcoin (right before it crashes and closes):
error - ..\SocketObject.cpp:126) poll() error in writeToSocket: 10038
Anything else I can try? I'm stumped!
