Check them out.  They have lots of good information available on the process.

Bitpay is the best way for us.  They cash us out with a 1% fee immediately.

Alternatively, use a service like BitPay, where you have eliminated your risk.  That's what we do.

Glad I can be of assistance!  Haha
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:16:32
Will do!
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:39:12
Thank you!  Call, reddit message, or email if there's anything I can do!
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:12:47
I've got a couple of Pre-Owned Toyotas!

Unfortunately, in Texas there are some strange laws with pricing online that will make us code the site to only display BTC *or* USD.  I think I'm going to have to put together a mirror site to avoid any legal issues.  :-(  I'll be happy to put up an estimate of any vehicle you like!  It'll be close to the MtGox current usd per btc.
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:24:48
We'll probably cash em out immediately, unless he gets a wild hair!  If we get some time to talk further, I may ask to get paid in BTC for any BTC deals.  Wouldn't that be cool?
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:24:57
We have used cars, too, as guessed below.  Feel free to browse and see what we have.  We do our best to keep a good variety stocked.  We can also ship a car to you.  Let me know if you ever need anything!
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:46:49
Absolutely.  I'll get something put together tomorrow.  Its been a busy day! 
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:45:37
Bitpay for us.  I do usd smaller exchanges for personal use, however! 
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:50:53
Ooh... good catch! 
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:20:27
Thanks for the tip!  Let me know if I can help!
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:08:30
We try to keep as many good deals as we can, but they go so fast!  Nice name btw, I'm a big Whovian.
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:25:06
Really, it comes down to paying the equivalent of USD in BTC whenever you're ready to pay.  That's how I've always looked at it.
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:10:00
Sorry you got downvoted.  I'm actually pretty happy with it.  People tend to not forget a name like Spanko!  :D
@_date: 2013-04-23 05:42:40
It's really great when I tell someone at a business my last name.  I have to emphasize that "Yes, it is Spank, with an O at the end."  I've gotten Stanko, Spanks, Spanco, Sparks, and any other permutation you can imagine.  I guess people just assume, "Surely, Spanko can't be his actual last name!"

While I'd love for everyone to pay MSRP, I won't force anyone to on most cars!  (Exception being GT500s, Raptors, and other specialty or rare cars). We treat it like a wire transfer.  The only difference is we're losing fees in the transition.  I'll do my best to make it a good deal, especially if you're out of the area!
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:52:08
Sounds great.  Let me know! 
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:41:16
I fully support this.
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:30:07
I'm sure it should be possible.  We do have to register the car, unless we label the title "export only."  That's at least my understanding.
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:13:44
From what it looks like, we'd just do the deal normally, and the main difference will be how you pay.  I hope to make it as easy as possible.  The biggest issue, in my eyes, is making sure you have a mobile phone or internet wallet set up, if you're coming in person.
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:09:32
Nobody we've talked to has said anything about it not being acceptable, so we're running with it.  We aren't aware of anything that would keep us from doing business as we are.
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:48:20
Sorry, the post should indicate we do sell used cars too!  Let me know if you see one you like! 
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:17:28
That depends on where you're titling, for the most part.  If you live here in Carrollton, TX, the sales tax is 6.25%.  Then the title/license/registration is usually around $200-$300 range.  Now, if you're exporting the vehicle out of the country, you wouldn't pay most of these fees/taxes.  To avoid any legal issues, the buyer would pay us in BTC for any fees, and it would be the same as buying a car by any other method.  Great question!
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:27:12
I hope BTC becomes a very large part of the world economy sooner, rather than later.  That's a big part of why I pushed so hard to accept it now.
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:49:05
Thanks! Call or email me if I can help! 
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:12:16
Absolutely.  We use BitPay, and they use the value of a bitcoin at the time of payment.  That way, a buyer can rest assured they're not being taken advantage of, and as a seller, we can be sure we're safe, too!
