Altcoins are cool because they have different ideologies to them. Plus if a mining pool ever gets 51% people would rather use a different coin. Bitcoin will not be spread out evenly so there is far less than 300,000 satoshis per person. Most people would be lucky to get 1 satoshi. 
Altcoins are great for people who want to have a whole coin.

None taken. Thats sketchy as fuck because I used BTC-E to withdraw this. They take out the fee of 0.001 and whenever I use BTC-E my coin gets where it needs to go faster than any other market I use. Are you saying they pocketed the 0.001 fee this time?

China can mine bitcoin cheaper than anybody else. They will dump all day. Regular miners bought a shitload of rigs and now difficulty is sky high. They will dump all day. It's just business. Regular holders are getting sick and tired of being told to hodl and watch their bitcoins depreciate every single day. So they're dumping, they don't care. Day traders want to buy bitcoins cheaper. They don't care either, they're dumping. Merchant acceptance is at an all time high. Every time you buy something with your bitcoins it gets dumped instantly on a market. Exchanges do margin calls and dump bitcoin for fiat. People are starting to realize this and they know that capitulation is coming. So in a self prophesied way everyone is going to dump in hopes of either catching that knife, or locking in their fiat.

I've had coins stolen from an online wallet, and I still to this day continue to store my coins on online web wallets. Its just not practical to send them back and forth between paper and exchanges. Now I just use a clean computer and 2FA. I've been in fiat hoping for a drop, but this one doesn't even feel good. I feel like shit for you guys. This sucks cause I can empathize and its as if I got my shit stolen all over again. Its a mix between sinking and numb. 
Its probable that all of this is an attempt to make bitcoin look as bad as possible so Gox can buy bitcoins on other exchanges for as cheaply as possible to pay you guys back. We've got names, locations, records. Hang in there. Its not 100% fucked just yet. But still pretty fucked.

I believe that Gox will go into receivership and all bitcoin holders will share the loss equally. Meaning you will more than likely get at very least a percentage of your coins back in maybe a month's time tops. Gox was just way too big to disappear without a trace and get away with it.

I feel bad for her. We all partially, secretly wanted to find Satoshi. Every reporter wanted to be the one to find him. We're all partly responsible. This isn't 100% on her. When you first heard that Satoshi was found did you click on the link to find out who he was or did you ignore it and think "NO! I'm gonna respect this man's privacy." 
Yes I know his security and privacy are ultimately the most important thing. What happened was ugly. But humans are curious creatures and Satoshi was and still is a huge mystery. You can't blame her for trying to give us what we all wanted. Now we feel bad about it and blame her. 
That being said taking a picture of his home and car's license plate was fucked up. I'm not saying this chick is totally innocent here. Just that some of the rage pointed towards her should actually be internalized shame. Part of us wanted this and now we regret having it.

There is more about food that we don't know than there is that we do know. We're constantly discovering new beneficial components in common foods. Trying to design and develop a replacement for food is not just ambitious, its dangerous. We don't know what the long term effects of Soylent are because it hasn't been around that long. The test pool is very tiny. Personally my assumption is that this is probably healthier for you than drinking slimfasts all day every day. However I wouldn't risk my health over a convenience. 
I am however hopeful that this will develop into something where you can take a piss, blood, hair and skin sample, load it up or mail it out to be analyzed and have a unique soylent blend created or printed for you (much like those arduino automated bartender machines). That would be cool, but this... this is way too new. It is a first step though, and that is amicable, as long as it isn't being sold as "ready" or "perfect" which it absolutely isn't. 
Cheers to the people who fully understand the risks and choose to let themselves become test subjects for this. This could be a very important solution to billions of people some day. I'd personally rather wait a decade and see how it works out for braver souls.

Buying something with bitcoins is the same as liquidating them for money so you can buy something else. I wonder if this is a bearish sign that they know something we don't, or if its marketing. They might be trying to fluff up the news with something positive and exciting. Given how bleak its been lately.

You mean like password protect a wallet on my computer? I'm well aware of the risks and reality of not having full ownership of my keys. I'll have to download mycelium and play around with it for a while. I've heard good things about it. A portion of my coins are on various exchanges though and it has to be like that. I like to set low buy orders on altcoins that I like. Every now and then one of them hits.

Every altcoin teaches us a lesson. They all have something unique about them (usually) and we watch how the market reacts to those features. Coinye will teach us what happens when lawyers go against a crypto coin. The software is well distributed so they won't stop it from being mined. But what will happen once the coin hits an exchange? Exciting times. I suspect a sloppy fire sale in the short term then people will snatch them up as a "fuck you" to the system and as a novelty. I see a bubble in Coinye's future.

Alright, so this download is kindof absurd for what I'm trying to do. I should have read about it more. What I ended up doing is turning my wallet into an offline paper wallet. But blockchain.info doesn't recognize the QR code. So I manually entered the root key: Neither electrum or blockchain.info recognize them. I entered the chaincode. Neither recognized them. I Went to armory and did a digital back up. Imported it into electrum. Electrum didn't recognize it. I did all versions of decrypted unecrypted. I've copied and pasted every single private key imaginable but I just get error messages. 
I think I have absolutely no choice other than letting the 20 gig blockchain download on my computer then transfer funds over to electrum, don't I.

If you get scammed you can always fight it and get your money back.

Capitulation is the word of the day. I agree with you. I too am shocked at how many people are saying Gox is dead and that everything is gone.

How's he supposed to sell his Gox coins on bitcoinbuilder when he can't even load mtgox.com? 
Plus the dollar sign on your 0.13 is confusing. They're not selling for 13 cents. They're selling for 0.13 bitcoins. Which is like what, 65 maybe 70 bucks? Yesterday around this time some went for as cheap as 32 bucks a coin. Damn shame considering they were almost 1100 a couple months ago. 
As to answer the OPs question. There's nothing you can do but wait and not stress out. Learn about paper wallets. Download electrum and mycelium wallets and get comfortable with those. Learn to take full control and ownership of your coins so some dumb faced fuck such as Mark can't gox you again.

My red flag moment was when they said their product has no toxins, and they put "good stuff like antioxidants" in it. This is basically Brawndo marketing 101. The only saving grace is that its sortof becoming viral and people who actually know what they're talking about are getting involved. Still though, money trumps good will almost every time. That being said you don't synthesis the parts of food you think you need and leave out the thousands of compounds that we as a collective don't yet understand. We all think oranges are good for us because of their vitamin C. So why not just eat vitamin C pills and give up oranges forever? It's absurd and dangerous.  
I'm all for the idea and development, I'm against people thinking this is 100% safe and ready.
These guys being successful just goes to show the huge demand for their product. Unfortunately we are nowhere near understanding how to synthesis a food replacement. The concept is almost absurd, but we do have to start somewhere. So, meh.

Soylent is not being marketed the same way as a Liquid-Protein-Modified-Fast Diets are marketed. People have died from just drinking shakes. The creator of Soylent however publicly states that his diet is 90% Soylent and that its been like that for almost a year. Everyone's nutritional demands are different. I'd be pro Soylent if certified nutritionists tailor made each shake and monitored drinkers individually.
Right now its basically slimfast stuffed with buzz words like "probiotics" and "antioxidants". Don't get me wrong, I want this to happen. Consumers want this to happen. But you can't go around saying its here now and its safe. Synthetic foods couldn't possibly be complete because we still don't fully understand compounds in foods we've been eating for thousands of years. These guys just use compounds that we know and understand. The human bodies demands are far too complex to think we've got a handle on them.

I think his MtGox coins are in his MtGox account's wallet. Hopefully what he is doing is in full compliance with their rules. Otherwise I wouldn't be surprised if Gox seizes the opportunity to wipe tens of thousands of bitcoins off of their list of owed coins.
I'm guessing though its his wallet and he's free to do whatever he likes with his coins and that no rules have in fact been broken. He's already asking for a lot of verification information to be in compliance with the government. I'm sure he's done his due diligence for MtGox as well. Just paranoid is all.

I agree with what you've said. I've been burned by web wallets, yet I still use them. They're quick and easy. And now with 2FA I feel they're more secure. I think what really fucks people is that printing an offline webwallet takes almost an hour (download a ubuntu image, put it on a flash drive, copy an online generator, setup your printer) then the real pain in the ass is trusting that paper wallet. How do you know they haven't injected some bullshit in the code, or that their random number generator really is random? What if the qr code smudges, did it work right? Let me test it out. 
I think everyone should print out a bunch of paper wallets and play with them. Send a few satoshi back and forth. Get a webcam and blockchain.info account. Get yourself really comfortable with paper wallets. Personally I would use them every day if BTC-E had a camera deposit feature. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:19:54
Here's what I think your average citizen thinks of when they think about bitcoin:
Its too good to be true, its too complicated, its not a physical thing you can hold in your hand, printing out an offline paper wallet and trusting it enough to put money onto it is scary (especially for people who can't figure out how to download and unrar a torrent) what if bitcoin really is like napster and a new thing comes and beats it, then you have fears like what if the government does something to kill bitcoin, what if bitcoin gets hacked, what if satoshi dumps all of his coins, what if the government changes its mind and makes bitcoin illegal.
Most importantly people don't like feeling embarrassed about losing money. So they don't bother with the risk. 
Many of these points are sound, some of them are flawed. But any single one of them would be enough to prevent your average joe into putting their hard earned beer and cigarette money into something some fat neckbeard was able to print thousands of for free back in the day. Buying bitcoins at this price means you're supporting lazy, lucky drug addicts. 
I could go on an on. The point is people heard of bitcoin and dismissed it for anyone of these reasons and never bothered really jumping in balls deep and researching it out for themselves.

0.045 bitcoin is 45 chips on [Seals With Clubs](
I suggest creating an account and playing freerolls until you start placing and wining chips. Then climb your way up from 1 chip, 5 chip, 10 chip, 20 chip, and 50 chip tourneys. Slowly. The amount of knowledge and entertainment you'll get from that $10 could equal 1/100th of a hit of DMT which you should probably actually buy instead.
If you go the poker route then make sure to create an offline paper wallet. Everytime your bankroll multiplies make sure to withdraw a percentage of it onto that paper wallet. It's very easy to get carried away and play out of your league. Especially when you're first figuring out how good you are or how much you suck. Knowing your place is expensive. But once you're there it can be slowly profitable. Just remember to manage your emotions as well as your bankroll.

They haven't released USD withdraws in a very long time. The price for bitcoin is expensive there because essentially what you have is tons and tons of bitcoiners who are trapped inside gox. The only way out is to buy a bitcoin and transfer it out. Artificially inflating the price.

Make it worth their while. Think of bitcoins as like drugs. If they don't want it, then let them try it for free. Meaning its up to us to load up our phones with bitcoins and barter. Nobody is going to give us cash for bitcoins, but they will trade us crap thats in their garage, or for a few beers. Thats how you get the ball rolling. Maybe maybe maybe the change in their pockets. Load that onto paperwallets. Print instructions on how to check their balance using blockchain.info. Or get their email address and email them a link so they can check. People are lazy and or dumb. Be patient and helpful, never a penis. 
Also no business is going to bother setting up a bitpay service even though its absurdly easy, if only 1 or 2 customers a year are going to pay with bitcoins. So you have to do all the work for them. For free. 
This is what it takes.

Yes. We can't try to pass that buck over to eachother. Whats that mob mentality where if something needs to get done nobody does it because they think someone else will? I know theres a name for it. We should all see bitcoin as our jobs. Bitpay needs to pay us all a commission and give us some kind of simple training so we can go out in the real world and set small businesses up. Make it so when they recieve payment they get a text message or something. So they don't have to purchase any kind of POS equipment. I can think of tons of small businesses that would be down. 
Bitpay, if you're listening please create a package that I can print out and give to local small businesses. Make it as easy for them to accept bitcoins as possible. Maybe even mail them free posters and stickers with their public addresses so they can stick them on the wall/cash register. I'll do my share of the leg work.

Show your prices in bitcoin. 0.011 is a much easier impulse buy than $11. Also offer a discount for bitcoin. Try to get the price to show as many 0s as possible. 0.009 would be much easier to let go of. You don't want to use mBTC, use the full bitcoin.

Quit drinking, quit smoking quit buying junk food and dumb shit. Bitcoin is your new dumb shit thing you do. I have a feeling that bitcoin might be $1000 or less for a while. Giving you a decent window to secure a coin for yourself. Sell all your stuff at a loss at if need be. If the price drops consider it a good thing. Most importantly manage your emotions, god knows its hard sometimes. Absolute worse case scenario you lose some money and feel like garbage, but you'll gain some very valuable life lessons.

Selling bitcoins for fiat supports the bitcoin community as well. Because you're selling to someone who wants in. Driving the price of bitcoin down doesn't make you anti bitcoin.

This is cool. If you want to buy a car at a discount all you have to do is buy bitcoin and wait for the price to go up. Once it does, boom you have your car. Of course this could backfire and leave you completely fucked and bitter.

You pay taxes when you either sell the coin for dollars or buy something with it. If you buy a bitcoin for 10 dollars and it turns into $10,000, the gov won't tax you until you "recognize your gains" meaning until you spend your bitcoin on buying a car, boat or currency. 
Accepting bitcoin and keeping it as a bitcoin is easy. You basically make a choice. Do I want an offline cold storage wallet that cant be hacked? Or do I want an online hot wallet with 2-Factor verification (meaning you use your phone or other device to verify that its you, along with your password) 
Think of this as having a savings and checking account. Spend the time to set yourself up two accounts. Thats the hard part and it should only take a couple hours to a full day at most. But the freedom and piece of mind you get is huge. Do it. Do it now.

That's what everyone said on the first ride up to $31. Then it crashed down to 2.50. You'll sell too. Not because you lost faith in bitcoin, but because you'll see the price drop and will want to liquidate your holdings so you can buy more coins on the way down. You'll do this because you're human.

I can't stand hearing this argument. If you bought right before the crash (not to speculate but to buy things) then you basically got fucked.

Don't feel so bad about having a miner. I used to mine about 3 coins a day back in 2011 using a hd 7950, then 1 coin a day then once I got down to .5 coins a day I decided to stop. The best part is if I kept going I probably would have made .5 coins a day for a whole year. But I stopped because I thought I was going to end up spending 6 months trying to make 1 coin @ 3 - 10 bucks a piece.
Keep in mind that card was loud, hot and kept me from using my computer while it was mining. Your miners are atleast small, cold, quieter and don't use up too much electricity. I'd leave them all plugged in and forget about them for a year. This is a great way to sortof short Bitcoin. By mining you're betting that the price will crash and difficulty will drop. They should bring you piece of mind, not regret.

Have any of you guys ever talked to Multi-level marketing crusaders? They're incredibly annoying and make you feel uncomfortable and pressured. You want to know what the secret to not sounding like one of them is? Indifference.
You can be as happy about it as you want, just have absolutely no interest in getting them in on it. In fact, make it sound horrible. Tell them you bought a few and now you feel terrible that you didn't buy more. And how now all you do is read about it and stare at charts. Its taken over your life. Your friends and family all secretly hate you. If they ask you how to get buy or earn them show them or coinbase. But don't try to sell it to them.

You still need land to live on and they're not making any more of it.
I suspect that there will be other cryptocoins that people can buy and use just like creditcards are visa/mastercard/discover you can choose whatever coin matches your philosophy of fair distribution. I'd love to buy groceries with PPCoin if I could. 
Also, nobody is going to feel demoralized trying to accumulate tiny pieces of bitcoin dust if it means a 5 percent yearly return on their money. 
I do feel your fear and I'll knock it up to paranoid. I think the CIA had something to do with the 2011 bubble. I mean Gavin spoke with them shortly before it happened.  They have tons of coins. SilkRoad netted a different part of our government a significant amount of coins. Id be very surprised if they liquidated them to the public and not the DEA/CIA. If anyone can manipulate markets I'm sure they could. I think this is going to get ugly and probably isn't going to bring peace on earth. 
TL:DR we will be jumping from altcoin to altcoin just like we jump from torrent site to torrent site in an attempt to out run the baddies. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 05:53:06
The US government has been balls deep in Bitcoin through the CIA. Gavin gave a speech to them pre 2011 crash. Actually about a month or so before the crash. Add the stash the Feds got from the Silk Road bust, which is probably not that much in comparison to what the CIA got after their little pump and dump and 1 year head start. Both China and the US don't seem to give a fuck about bitcoin though. Which is good. It's as if they want it to grow.

You do both, and here's why. If you buy a coin now and the price drops, you'll learn how to manage your emotions and deal with it.

Nice, a few days ago I woke up in a panic because the price dropped to 2 bucks and change. I remember not being afraid because I didn't liquidate, but I was afraid because I didn't think coinbase would honor my buy in time. 
Then thinking about it I remembered that I was dreaming of bitcoinity and that its possible I was looking at $2 and change per mBTC.

The women I know who have bitcoin also tend to be more bullish than men.

So you suggest bitstamp? Whats the name of this app?

Facebook already burned a bunch of suckers over hype. Bitcoin is way too volatile and in-case you guys forgot we're still in the middle of a deflating bubble. Find someone else to hold your bag.

The sad thing here is that I'm only 95% sure that you're joking.

Whoever is down-voting this is a dumbass. Its an entertainment service that is accepting bitcoin.

I wondered this myself and asked a tax preparer. Apparently "fair market value" is what we're looking for. Its an average of the market price. Its as if I paid you for your services with a car. Every car dealership has a different price for that car, but we could still establish an overall market price. Receiving your bitcoin also gives us a timestamp. We could use that to find out what it was worth at the time, on average.

That's actually a neat trick. How heavy are the fees, and how complicated is the taxation situation there?

It's not stupid. This is basically how you short Bitcoin. If I think Bitcoin is going to go down in price then I'll borrow 10 Bitcoins, sell them. Then when the price tanks I buy 10 Bitcoin or 10.5 and pay you back. Keeping the profit.

I gotta say, I think this is bullshit too. Bots pick up hard passphrases within hours of coins being deposited in them. From the sounds of it you're saying the passphrase is something that could be copy and pasted into google and found. So I'm guessing theres no numbers in it and its not all jumbled like it should be. If thats the case a bot would have taken it a very long time ago. 
Still a good PSA though.

2 weeks? I deposited money in 5 minutes using bit instant.

Thats like saying "I went swimming and someone took a shit in the swimming pool, so it sucked. Except nobody took a shit in the pool during the morning so the whole thing was still positive."
Meaning not everyone bought in when it was good. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:28:02
I concur. Refreshing the market every 2 seconds after a purchase is guaranteed to make you feel bad.

Those guys sleep?

Interesting. The more places that accept bitcoin the more selling pressure bitcoin feels. I think its funny that everyone says "don't sell your bitcoins, spend them instead." It looks as though there is no difference between selling and spending now.  I'm glad though, the current price is pretty absurd.

Will confirms of direct bitcoin to wallet ever be faster than 20 minutes? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:18:49
To be fair I told him 1 bitcoin will equal a house some day. So I either owe him a bitcoin or a house. I will make that little prick whole someday one way or another.

Peter had great points. Erik concedes that bitcoin isnt really meant to be an investment and that its mostly a payment system. However Peter makes the point that if the buyer and seller are only interested in Fiat then they're both going to get buttfucked by conversion fees, not to mention the risk of volatility. Making the 10 cent transfer fee argument not really matter. 
The only problem I have with Peter is that he says he wants the government out of money, but he wants bitcoin to somehow be backed by physical gold. How on earth would you do that without some sort of centralized entity? I'm guessing Peter doesn't know either, but he's trying to tell us to figure it out somehow. 
Very good debate.

I agree, if I want to send $50 then I'll buy $50 worth of bitcoin and send it. I don't care if that's 2 bitcoins or .0000009 bitcoins. People who use bitcoins and people who hold bitcoins are to totally different animals.

I heard quantum computing is worthless for cracking SHA. Does anybody know for sure?
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:24:17
This seems pretty reasonable. You're saying eventually there will come a tipping point where nobody will convert to fiat? I can't help but think it would put bitcoin into a death spiral, giving no businesses any incentive for holding. Why hold something that has such a tremendous amount of sell pressure? They're businesses not speculators.

Anyone who shits on you for giving them a gift is a cunt. You should feel embarrassed for the people receiving the gift and not being grateful about it. It makes them look low class and trashy. Nobody is getting any kind of ideology or belief forced down their throats. They could spend them like giftcards whenever they want. 
The fuck is wrong with you, op?
