"Donate your bananas"
@_date: 2019-11-05 15:16:35
Shut up and take my money

Ron Paul also apparently just got his first BTC last week? Would have thought he already has quite a bit.
@_date: 2019-11-21 21:56:30
I think I'd rather have bitcoin than bananas...

Pine set off a trend with Bitcoin giving. Recently spoke with many of the nonprofits who were recipients and recapped it here: [
@_date: 2019-10-30 12:28:48
The institutions are here, they're just not the ones we expected! 100+ nonprofits with millions of followers will be participating.
@_date: 2019-10-31 17:27:04
Love it. Seeing it in more schools all the time. Coinbase did a study recently that found 56% of the top 50 universities now have blockchain/crypto courses
@_date: 2019-10-28 23:09:33
The difference being that if you sell your Bitcoin first, you have to pay taxes on the gains. If you donate directly, you do not so it saves you 20-30% depending on your rate.
@_date: 2019-10-30 17:28:25
Not a ton yet, but by Bitcoin Tuesday we will have a big campaign that includes lightning donations for the 100+ nonprofits participating. Lookout for an announcement from The Giving Block next week on a partnership :)

Which school is it? We just started working with Wake Forest University so they can easily accept crypto donations.
@_date: 2019-12-04 00:05:57
I'm sorry, I didn't know someone had a gun to your head to donate! Its all optional.
@_date: 2019-12-13 13:54:14
Well, if you're already paying taxes you might as well deduct donations...
@_date: 2019-12-29 17:51:48
Is it also a disco ball?

They're two very different cases. I think Ross has done a lot as well, but think his work has reached a different audience, mostly already in the bitcoin community. The media spun most things related to Ross pretty negatively unfortunately. The Silk Road stories are still a barrier for getting people to learn about Bitcoin. 
Pine reached entirely new audiences, in a very positive way.

Surprised this isn't creating more FOMO for people. So many people think its too late.
@_date: 2019-12-02 19:46:21
Thanks for encouraging people. One point that wasn't mentioned is the unique tax benefit of donating your appreciated Bitcoin (no capital gains tax and its a write off) which makes it a more efficient way to donate than using a credit card. 
As Mike mentioned below, we are running the first ever  initiative tomorrow with 100+ nonprofits at [bitcointuesday.org]( 
Help us reach our goal of $1M worth of crypto donations tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:17:53
Up to $15k in donations will be matched by Gemini and Bottle Pay too!
@_date: 2019-12-29 17:56:12
One of the few nonprofits not converting to USD
@_date: 2019-12-12 22:06:19
We have created the only nonprofit specific solution for accepting crypto and happy to help get the school setup in a way that donations are automatically converted to USD when they come in. Check us out at [thegivingblock.com](

One day we will get there! I think charity adoption is a great way to spread general mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2019-12-03 15:42:21
Yes, via Bottle Pay!
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:16:15
Thanks for everyones support so far! Just because it isn't Tuesday anymore, doesn't mean things are over. You can still donate and help spread the word!

Awesome, thanks for your support! It all helps encourage more organizations to begin accepting bitcoin in the future.
@_date: 2019-12-23 03:03:46
Yes they accept fiat, but also BTC, ETH, LTC, ZEC and BCH.
@_date: 2019-12-24 16:44:27
One of the most inspirational figures in the last two years. Pine has probably done more for adoption than anyone else. The positive press around this was amazing and introduced thousands of people to Bitcoin.

Donations up to $15k are being matched to Tor today when made through The Giving Block's widget at [

Yes I've taken a look and love what they're doing. Unfortunately, it requires a little bit more technical knowledge  than other solutions which makes the barrier to entry a little higher for now.
