I'll admit I'm growing a little concerned. Between Bitinstant completely ignoring my attempts to contact them, my wallet taking 2 days to load before I can even use the coins, and the market falling, I'm thinking I made a mistake :(

Thanks, didn't realize that.
So I still can't use the encrypt wallet option, is that due to my wallet not synchronizing?
And what is the purpose in saving the DAT file on a USB? Say my computer with my wallet burns in a fire, how does the DAT file help me?

Still no response after more attempts FYI. Bitcoin falling and poor customer service won't even let me access my funds. Really can't recommend Bitinstant to anyone based on this.

And the best part, they're out of the office for the day! Because never mind your customers are losing money by the second, 9-5 is a firm schedule! ;)

Not my experience thus far unfortunately. Placed my order, was confirmed to have went through via moneygram/zipzap, yet still no coins in my wallet. Contacting them through email and livechat support? Useless, never received a response.
It's one thing to have software issues, it's another to leave someone who trusted you with their money hanging. Really disappointing.

It's companies like yours that will hold back the advancement of digital currency. How is anyone supposed to believe in the currency when there are companies like Bitinstant out there basically stealing their customer's money?(and then running and hiding after doing so.)

The Settings - Encrypt Wallet option is currently grey/unclickable, is this because my wallet has yet to synchronize?
I had the same thought as you, re: my house burning down, computer being destroyed, etc. which is why I was hoping to find what my private key is, write it on a piece of paper, and store it in a safe/secure location. But I can't figure out how to find my private key. When I try and view the DAT file, it's just a jumble of symbols and letters, completely unreadable.

Wish I had read this before using Bitinstant. Money was instantly confirmed to have successfully went through Moneygram/Zipzap, yet still no coins in my wallet. Contacted them through email and their live chat feature, and still no response from either. Really disappointing both from a software and customer service standpoint. 
Thanks for creating threads like this guys, hopefully someone is a little smarter than me and reads through the threads before trusting their money with just anyone.
