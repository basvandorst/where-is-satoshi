I reinstalled bitcoin core 0.15.1 in a new partition (and bigger ssd), and download the full blockchain, without prune, and I have now 20 connections, 13 incoming and 8 outcoming, finally! I feel useful by contributing to the bitcoin network now! thanks for all your help

the only thing missing for GreenAddress to be perfect is the option to manually choose your node, like Bread

thank you! I'll keep an eye, and updates here

thanks for your quick response! I did that at 550. It took like 5 minutes on the load screen 'done loading' and now it still syncing headers..
I'll wait and leave it like that...

Its finished now, its synced. Now, How do I change the path for the blockchain folder? Can I moved it manually, from my external drive to an internal drive (main one with OS and bitcoin-qt client installed)
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:26:39
sorry for late reply, yes, it still syncing so I guess I'm fine,,
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:58:45
will this work?
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:05:02
You are right, I just moved manually and when I started the client, it asked me for the new path of the folder, thanks for all your help! Now I need to set up the network settings and start my full node!

One more thing, I opened port 8333, and I have 8 outbound connections and 1 incoming, running for 1 hour now.. I read other threads and seems to work as long as I have more than 8 connections right? by 'work' I refer to 'contribute' to the bitcoin network, but the question is for 1 incoming connection, do I really have everything correctly? I tried to connect manually with my bread wallet on my phone and I wasnt able, (tried 2 different networks).
**Update (11/29)
its being up for 6 days now constantly, and the most incoming connections I ever had are 3, right now I have 2 incoming and 8 outcoming, am I doing something wrong? can you help me?

@_date: 2017-11-29 18:51:54
sure! Im interested, send me the slack invitation
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:56:15
I did, but it said my password is incorrect, already change it and everything, still same issue.. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:43:46
and now we see very small blocks from Bitcoin Cash ABC
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:35:42
this, consider using a paper wallet

why do you recommend samourai on your anonimity guide, instead of green address? Does green address lacks security?
@_date: 2019-09-30 19:22:50
depends on the cryptocurrency you are willing to mine, BTC for example is not mineable with a CPU anymore, difficulty is too high now
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:05:52
What do you suggest other than NOT mine at this pools?  Do you have information on other pools as well like BitClub Network, Bitfury, kanopool ? On a side note, slushpool took more than 16 hours without finding a block, and their rewards system is based on luck, so we didnt get paid all that time.. that's also something miners are concerned. Respectfully I ask to you, which pool do you suggest to join?

can I add old purchases at walmart into Lolli? I just heard about Lolli ..
