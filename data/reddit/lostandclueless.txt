Alrighty, so I should just buy them from a website and then transfer them to a wallet, and then upload them from wallet to website when I want to sell them again right?
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:12:37
yeah, it has to be that way, I understand, oh well, thanks a lot mate, good luck on your investments!
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:15:05
Alright, I've got myself a wallet and everything; one last question, what do you do when you change your phone or something, you download the wallet again and put in those "security" recovery words?
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:43:00
stamp, signed, bank logo, everything you can possibly want. I asked the lady there specifically to be signed and everything so yeah.
As I said, in my opinion they are assholes about it. They ask for this I give them this and then they say they want something else for no reason... basically because they think it's not original, as if they have any clue about anything in the first place.
Then after I explain the situation they ask something else, I give them that and they go back to asking as before.

how can I see my private key ?
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:02:44
I did and it seemed the biggest bank for ppl outside U.S but didn't knew they are so unreliable.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:41:33
Yes mtgox sucks, I was about to invest 2000 euro with them on bitcoins but they gave me so much shit, I sent them my proof of medical insurance and they said it's not good enough also they declined my ID for not being 3000 DPI scan, seriously ? back then the bitcoins were 200..
I am an European, can someone help me and tell me what's the best service if you are european ?
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:05:48
I've first sent under 300 and I had id and medical insurance, was declined because they weren't above 300 and they didn't accept the insurance, now I sent them above 300 and bank statement and they declined me with no apparent reason.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:11:23
interesting idea, would mind telling me how the note should sound like ?
@_date: 2013-11-05 08:43:54
Oh man.. I feel so bad for you, I can't imagine the depression you must have right now, so sorry, how can this happened ? you basically transfer it something where u can't use it?
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:41:52
Yea you're right. Okay thanks for the advice, I'll try that even though meanwhile I sent a support thicket, I wanna cut some time. Thanks
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:59:01
I see, so I should put a copy of his ID as well ? 
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:58:02
I'll see into it, I just don't want to have any problems withdrawing.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:34:08
Oh this is awesome, my biggest fear about a wallet is my old pc crashing somehow or someone deleting it, who knows, but I can basically write all this on paper and revive it anytime right?
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:21:52
No they did not, after many messages I kept asking them what's wrong with my documents since they ARE according to their "standard" and they said that "they can't verify the authenticity of the documents" as if it's my problem that they can't verify it. They can't verify anything anyways so what the hell right, call the bank ask them, again, how's that my problem.
So they said if I can give them a document released by my local municipality that proves my residency and I gave them a proof of insurance issued by the municipality that clearly states my residency which they said that they accept only bank statements or utility bills.
So I don't have utility bills on my name since I don't have a house and I live with my parents and they dismiss my bank statement because basically they think it's not legit in their opinion.
Therefore as I don't like mtgox and the other sites seem to be even more unreliable I won't buy bitcoins.
Bunch of assholes if you ask me, I hate bitstamp so much atm and they pissed me off to incredible extents.
Due to them I also missed the huge bubble which I wanted to invest 3000$.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:14:13
I don't know if I'm allowed if I don't own the house but anyways I lost that bubble and I've been waiting it for months, would've made a nice 2k over 2 days and that's why I'm so mad about it. I'll see about having an utility bill on my name.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:27:40
Thanks, great info !
Also I have one last question, I know that once I acquire them I can move them freely wherever I want, is it safe to keep them for example on my bitstamp account or should I put them on my wallet.dat. And I heard a guy that moved his bitcoins on blockchain account and lost them forever, because he didn't do something beforehand... before I move my bitcoins I gotta verify something on the website or what?
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:13:27
he lost 301 btc? DAMN!!
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:01:29
in this order?
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:47:17
Not a chance before the big bubble I knew for sure the price is going to go up 100% now it's more of a gamble. The price went up, it didn't go back to 1100 so now it dropped again because people feel uncertain, now it's a big chance it gets even lower since that's been the trend in the past days it can stir another big break. Even if that big break happens I still can't invest because as I said... MtGox seems extremely sluggish and unrealiable to me and the others seem to small to be trusted. If you know any good alternative for an European tell me but I'm afraid I'll have the same problems with the verification process.
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:57:16
You'll probably get accepted. If you ask me I honestly think they're racial or something about it. They see I'm from Romania they're like: "Oh look Eastern Europe, let's investigate this guy more thoroughly, even though he sent us a perfectly acceptable bank statement with stamp and signature, although we can't verify anything anyways let's ask him for an utility bill just to make sure because that's where the thieves come from."
That's how I see it at least.
