In fact, according to my system, you should buy $615 of btc for every btc you purchased at $1000.
Don't spend all your money on it though. :)) Whatever you can afford to lose, as they say. I'm just saying you have a huge buy signal right now.
PLUS, you're way ahead of the game, having ignored all the other buy signals on the way down. Ha!

No phone confirmation. It's very easy; use this link to enter your key and give it a username.
That link is on the page that I linked to above.
Bookmark the page; I give the bookmark a stealth name. Then, whenever you need a 2fa code, come back to that page. You can add and subtract keys, as many as you like. You should save the key somewhere, in case that entry is somehow deleted accidentally.
OP did not state specifically that he wants to enable 2fa on google or gmail, just that he wants to set up google 2fa. I use it for btce and okcoin, also used it for mcxnow.
I don't think this can be used for gmail, not sure. I don't know that they give you the key. They call me on my landline.
Sorry for any confusion.

|The article says that they thought his volume was high enough to be an unregistered MSB.|
Huh? He was buying, not selling, for fuck's sake. Nothing about that implies MSB. Their suspicion that he was selling on LBC certainly WAS the problem. The question, if I recall, was how the hell did they know he was sending coins to LBC, because he claimed he didn't do so directly. That was when this subreddit first woke up to the horrendous fact that these jerks were tracking their coins even AFTER they had been sent to their personal wallets. The thread was titled "Coinbase is a Corporate Bully", and the poor OP was downvoted into oblivion.

Since I do the bulk of my shopping at Whole Foods and Amazon, I buy gift cards with btc at gyft.com. Their standard discount is 3%, sometimes a special 5% or 6%. Whenever I send them btc, it's instantaneous. It's really fun! I LOVE gyft.com. Haven't tried e-gifter yet, they have discounts too. No worries about ID fraud, which is SO rampant today.
I often see posts on r/bitcoin that refer to btc discounts at all sorts of places, internet as well as b&amp;m. There is incentive for them to give discounts, because they save so much money accepting btc, and don't have to deal with chargebacks.

|if he was buying decent amounts multiple times a day, every day|
Who said that was the case? Nobody. He said a few a week, and sometimes he would go months not buying any. Do you think buying a few a week constitutes MSB? And justifies tracking, tracing, and snooping?
Also, selling btc at LBC is not necessarily against Fincen regulations. It depends upon the purpose of the sale.
@_date: 2014-12-25 07:09:10
Yeah, how dare he have the audacity to expect the fair price that had been locked in. Ooooooooooo, he was using it like an exchaaaaaaaange!
@_date: 2014-12-21 07:58:23
Some of the pro sellers at localbitcoins have begun using AML/KYC and registering as MSB (Money Services Business), due to Fincen requirements and some recent arrests of non-compliant sellers.
Also, the sellers are being scammed a lot by MIM attacks (man in the middle), so they often require photo ID, selfie with photo ID, utility bills, etc. Especially for the larger buys.
I think this may be the reason premiums at LBC seem to have decreased by quite a bit. They're no longer able to give total anonymity, therefore must offer competitive pricing.

Meant to add, you can't do credit or debit card at localbitcoins, because the sellers don't have merchant accounts; even if they did, it's too easy to do a chargeback with the cards, so sellers wouldn't want to touch that. Some will sell using Paypal, but it's very expensive, because that too can be easily reversed.

In a case where you deposited cash into the seller's bank account, you have the deposit receipt as proof, and you would auto-win the dispute.
For in-person cash transactions, escrow is not used; at least, not recommended, because of time restrictions. Instead, they use a code. The buyer gives the cash to the seller, and the seller uses the code to release the btc, or gives the code to the buyer. I've never done an in-person trade, but if I did, I think I would video the whole thing, in case the seller denies receiving the cash. Same thing if I were the seller.
For all the other payment options, the buyer would have some kind of proof, a receipt or code, and escrow would be released to him.

Keep after Paypal. Bitcoin sellers don't like to go through Paypal, because they always are happy to do a chargeback for the buyer. Keep calling them back and ask to speak to a supervisor. 
Also, do not do any trades out of escrow. Localbitcoins has escrow, and it's very safe for a buyer to do the cash deposit method there. You just deposit cash into the seller's bank acct, and he releases the coins to you. If anything goes wrong, the coins will be released to you anyway, after a short dispute window. But there is no reason for the seller to try to scam you, because he knows he can't get away with it . Good luck!
Alternatively, you could try LibertyX. Or Changetip if it's not over $50.

However identity theft happens, it happens a LOT with the fiat banking system, and is a nightmare for the victims. Law enforcement turns a blind eye, and they must sort everything out themselves.

Some sellers on Localbitcoins require identifying information; some don't. Sometimes it depends on the size of the transaction. If you click on "Buy", the page will tell you what information the seller requires, before you initiate the transaction. Then you can choose to bow out.
As far as the bank goes, Chase is the only one I've heard of that requires ID. That is for cash deposits into business accounts. Chase doesn't allow cash deposits into personal accts AT ALL, unless you are the acct holder.

Yes, I've learned all this from the Alex Jones Show. Jones said the Boston Bombings were going to be blamed on domestic terrorism as a false flag of a false flag; they already had a homespun guy in custody, and all the news crews waiting, but had to let him go (actually, probably killed him) when Jones' crew identified by photos the real false flag bombers (at least 2 of them, who happened to have heavy CIA connections; the place was crawling with navy seals, CIA, govt contractors, green berets, etc). Then again, tons of videos on youtube support the theory that they weren't real bombs, and crisis actors were used. 
Whatever actually happened in Boston, one thing is clear. It was a test run for martial law in America. Did you see the paramilitary tanks and people being forced out of their homes at AK47 gunpoint, because they were looking for 2 guys who killed 3 people?

If it's a short-term capital gain (held less than one year), it's taxed as ordinary income. 
Longer-term capital gains (held more than one year) have their own tax table, which relates to the tax brackets for  ordinary income. For example, if you are in one of the two lowest tax brackets for ordinary income, your long-term capital gains tax rate is 0%. If you are in a higher ordinary income tax bracket, your long-term capital gains tax is either 15% or 20%.
One thing to keep in mind is that your short-term gains have the potential to push your long-term gains into a higher long-term tax bracket.

Localbitcoins will always give you a nice thorough receipt you can print out, which will work fine for your tax basis. Also, if you buy using the cash deposit method, which is very easy and safe for the buyer, the bank will give you a receipt for the deposit.
@_date: 2016-11-04 14:45:56
Why not?
@_date: 2016-12-02 13:55:21
No, you are fine. If it was held more than one year, your capital gains tax rate is zero, because your income was zero.
If it was held short-term, you still owe zero, because your standard deduction would have more than offset your ordinary income tax.

I don't think of him as GOP, he's about as far from the neo-cons as you can get. He's a staunch constitutionalist, free market capitalist, pro-liberty, anti-tyranny.
To me, he's a Libertarian. The Libertarians are the true liberals today, NOT the Democrats.

Paul's record in the Senate proves that he has the courage of his convictions. Both Pauls, yes.

Coinbase is either lying or ignorant. It is simply NOT TRUE that, if you sell bitcoin to individuals for USD, you are automatically considered by FinCEN to be a money transmitter that requires MSB licensing. It depends on the purpose for the sale. If the sale is for only YOUR benefit, you are not an MSB. Their guidelines clearly state that if you want to purchase a product or service with your bitcoin, but bitcoin is not accepted as payment, you may sell some bitcoin for that purpose. You are also allowed to sell your bitcoin for investment and diversification purposes.
You however are not allowed to sell bitcoin solely for the purpose of making a profit, if it is for someone else's benefit. That would require MSB licensing.
Yeah, it sucks regardless. But Coinbase is WRONG.

If you play tournaments, you get to play with the entire WPNetwork, which is pretty huge.
Bitcoin in, bitcoin out, fast!

Tell that to Christine Lagarde and the IMF, who have pretty much announced that there will be a global economic reset.

Have them meet you at a bank, where there are security guards. And you can have the teller check for counterfeits.

Did you know that there is actual computer information written inside superstring equations? We are all decoding this information as we speak, to create this 4-dimensional illusion of space-time reality.
So because I brought it to your attention that this contest is merely an illusion.....
pm me for address :))
