Those are called full nodes. I run two. One from my house, one from my mom's cuz why not. I had an extra laptop, and I have to config her wifi anyway. All I had to do was forward 8333. Why not?  lets go! . I bet she is the only 70 some  year old old gramma running a full node at her house.  Laptop is by the China cabinet. Yes. She has a China cabinet. hahahhaha 
@_date: 2018-08-25 19:39:20
gave a static IP to the laptop, then forwarded port 8333 to it. since she is behind a NAT, like every other home, i have to configure a forwarding rule to send btc traffic to the the laptop. without it, the router wouldn't know who to send that traffic to. It needs incoming connections.

when you hear how a country had to borrow paper money from another country, to pay for a project in said country, which they had to pay with interest, which the lending country just printed up, makes you think how fucked all this banking situation is. it is related.

I firmly believe the reason we are a few years over due for the engineered  collapse that they present us every 7 to 8 years -is- because of crypto. What they do is pull liquidity. thats how they crash it! and when people default, they take the equity. Now, we are liquid. Some might say, even too liquid.
