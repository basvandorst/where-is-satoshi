Ah, that makes more sense.

Fair enough. But OP could make a similar argument that since he believes that they should adopt segwit since it would be good for the ecosystem then doesn't OP have just as much right to talk about it in this manner as the businesses do to not adopt it?

What are you talking about? If it wasn't opt-in everyone would already be using it because they would have to. Literally the only time this post is relevant is when it's opt-in.

It it's not "Important money" then don't cash out and forget about it for a while. At least then you have a chance to get a return.

BS, there are instructions on their support website on how to pop it open and look at the circuit board complete with pictures of what it should look like. No highly technical equipment needed.

I'm just debunking your claims there there is not much gold in the earths surface due to it all "sinking" to the core. Asteroids have a pretty constant amount of gold which tends to match the composition we would expect based on what a supernova produces. I didn't think that side was confusing to anyone so I didn't talk about it.

Look up movement of gold in the subsurface and you will find that it is heavily dependent on movement of heated water in the ground surface, otherwise known as hydrothermal activity. Believe it or not that's how it works.

Just because there is a large amount of gold farther down does not mean all the gold at the surface has "sunk down". Most surface gold has come up from deeper down from hydrothermal activity. It's literally the opposite of what was stated above.

Gold hasn't "sunk" down since the surface solidified billions of years ago. The opposite of that has happened though. Almost all surface gold that has been mined has come from hydrothermal activity where gold is dissolved into the hydrothermal liquid and gets deposited closer to the surface.

I went through this already, it's not more likely on the surface of the earth itself you are searching blindly, but it gets concentrated in areas with hydrothermal activity. At no point did I say that concentrations on the earths surface as a whole are greater than in asteroids. But again that doesn't matter because it gets concentrated via hydrothermal events. The part I specifically said wasn't true at all to has been removed, but you knew that already. Either way, this conversation isn't going anywhere so have a nice day.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:35:34
At what point did I say there was less in asteroids?  It doesn't matter that there is less on earth because gold is mostly in hydrothermal area where the concentrations are much higher. That's what makes it a minable region. The the massive cost of finding and recovering the asteroid mixed with its relatively small mass it is not economically viable and will not be for a long time.
 But again, that was not my point, my point is that once the surface solidified billions of years ago the gold stopped sinking. You are and extremely hostile individual, and it makes me question what you want when all you do is change what I was talking about and then tell me I'm wrong.

If you go to new you see stuff some of the time, it usually gets downvoted because it's propaganda. They can't really spam the comment threads over there either since most of the topics aren't specifically about bitcoin.
