Yes, we are already looking at increasing the reach to more countries and mobile operators. We'll be announcing these on the website [piiko.com]( and on the [Umbrellab]( twitter account.
And thanks, we're glad you like it :)

This service was built simply in Beta and gained quick popularity before anyone had the time to beatify it.
We're hoping to make it much clearer and easier to use in the next few weeks.
But **overtmind**, as I said earlier, please let us know if you have any suggestions for making it better. We really are counting people like you and on the bitcoin community to help us improve this service.

This limit was set by us at Umbrellab in order to monitor the activity during this beta phase, and it will be reviewed and reset in order to comply with licencing laws as well once it is rolled out to public.
Thanks for notifying us about this thread :)

This is great news! Did you know you're the first one from China?
We keep working with operators to reduce their charges and make it cheaper for all users. That's our aim :)

You can click on the grey box and load the drop down menu which shows you all the countries ;)

Too bad about your SIM card!!
Some of the recharge providers in some countries are charging too much for the service, and we're trying to improve that. Ideally all these should be between +0% to 2%, which will enable us to pass similar rates to all users. After all, we want everyone to use the service, and cheaper rates benefits everyone.

Thanks for your comment. We are being charged by our operators higher fees in some countries, so we reduce our fee in those countries to almost zero just to keep it worthwhile for users to use our service.
These fees will keep changing as we negotiate with operators, and we will announce more changes and lower costs as we go.
In the end, we would like to make Piiko as cheap as possible for you, because we want everyone to benefit from it and use it.

Thanks, we will definitely start working on that :)
