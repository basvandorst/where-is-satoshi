BTC is only a deflationary currency so long as actual demand for it outpaces the small inflationary force of mining. It's a tricky balance of supply, demand, transaction utility, computational costs, culture, and more. 


This isn't actually true. The current price is based on a market that is constantly balancing future risk vs future reward. Today it may be in a deflationary bubble (failure of a market to balance risk and reward) and soon it may collapse and massively inflate.
It's only been deflationary (on average) over its lifetime because people have increasingly seen its utility as a currency or monetary reserve and decided to take a gamble on it. But just as many people sold at 18k because they think it will crash and burn as have bought at 19k because they think it will succeed. It isn't inherently deflationary; it is only so if people continue to find it to have increasing utility.
I got lucky with my speculation on bitcoin and recently cashed out a small portion to pay back a loan. In the future (if I get even more lucky) I may cash out all of it to get another hopefully deflationary asset, like a home. Real estate over the past few years has been far less deflationary than Bitcoin, but it provides immediate utility beyond its potential economic value, and more utility than holding units of currency which may lose all their value in a year. 'Deflationary' currency makes up a decent portion of my net worth, but I'm still willing to spend it for things that I need now. Things that have real utility for me and which reduce my overall risk profile (since crypto is still quite risky compared to a paid-off loan or a house).
Is this really worse than an economy driven by debt piled on top of debt? At some point, if managed improperly, the system becomes insolvent and the debt bubble pops. That's why the genesis block of Bitcoin is a headline about the 2008/9 bank bailouts. Is velocity of money truly a hallmark of a strong economy? Is the American and western economy fundamentally improving today, or headed to another collapse? Does deflation interact with the economy in a destructive positive feedback loop, or is it just a symptom of a variety of economic conditions? The jury (and market) is out on all of these questions and at best, the steady target of 2% inflation is one of many possible economic models for a functioning society, but not the only one that could work.

Because those are the trades people are making on each exchange. There are people doing arbitrage which keeps the prices and movement similar, but basically it costs time and money to move money between different exchanges so they end up being traded at different prices.

This is true and a good point. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 05:08:56
But how do you see what we have now turning into something that doesn't work and that is very vulnerable or damaging to Bitcoin? I just don't see a way for that much trust to pile up into this system without there being a real reason for it. Maybe I'm just too optimistic about people's caution.

For your second question, the answer is no. The key logger might monitor the locations of your touches, and even if that was all the information it had, figuring out when you're using an on-screen keyboard and which keys you are pressing wouldn't be terribly difficult.

Multi-signature transactions can have more than two required signatures. That's why it's 'multisig'. Even more than that, you can have m-of-n transactions where you require at least m out of n signatures on a transaction for it to go through. For example, a two-of-three transaction could involve a merchant, a consumer, and a third party arbitrator. If the transaction goes smoothly, the merchant and customer sign the transaction and the arbitrator isn't required. If there's a problem then the arbitrator is called in to decide who should get the money. If they side with the merchant, they add their signature alongside the merchant's and the transaction goes through without the customer's signature. 
Of course, any reliable and trustworthy arbitration service will have associated fees, so it's hard to say whether this sort of thing will outcompete the traditional systems on that front.

Are you suggesting that large amounts of people might start using colored bitcoins to integrate large amounts of value into the blockchain before it becomes secure to do so? Honest question, I'm just trying to imagine a scenario where this becomes a problem before it gets solved and I can't think of a realistic way for that to happen. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 16:27:22
I want this to happen just because I have the cloud-to-butt Chrome extension installed and reading about this new 'Bitbutt' and 'Buttcoin' is hilarious.
@_date: 2014-01-10 14:51:16
So does anyone know what they are doing with their bitcoin? New sites taking it as payment is nice, but unless they're actually buying things with it themselves (rather than trading it for USD) they're just propping up the speculation market and aren't really doing anything for the bitcoin economy. Though perhaps this is the only way to bootstrap it at this point.
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:35:57
I'd recommend also including printing out the address expressed in alphanumerics and providing a URL/link to a site with a payment button, perhaps multiple buttons for coinbase, bitpay, etc. Not everyone will be able to conveniently use the QR code.

That's exactly it. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 23:40:18
I really don't find it easy to imagine people purchasing high value property and businesses in a manner that could be foiled by a double-spend. The idea is pretty ludicrous to me.
As for your unspecified 'smaller value additions' and 'many other ways', you're not really helping me come up with ideas here.

Does anyone else get the opposite psychological effect from having a small denomination? For me, the effect is a feeling that I have a whole lot of something that's worthless, like so many grains of sand, and it's hard to tell just how much it all adds up to. 
I agree that fractions like 0.001 are not great for daily use either, personally I liked the mBTC well enough, especially since it kept it clear that the measurement was a fraction of a bitcoin, just like mL, mm, ms, etc.
But if it catches on I suppose one can get used to anything.

@_date: 2014-05-31 13:42:18
Okay but I'm still not convinced that colored bitcoins are in any danger of being used this way so extensively that it becomes a problem. Why would it be, if it's so obviously not suited to being a secure way to do these things? 
@_date: 2016-11-05 11:18:33
If you lose or leak the private key the money is gone and nobody can help you. Imagine if all the banks in the world had no fraud protection and everyone was liable for funds spent when their identity is stolen. 
Bitcoin has the potential for tools to be developed that make it much more secure and easy to use than any other payment method, but they are not yet perfected.

Beat the market? Just riding the market for the past few years is an order of magnitude better than basically any other stock or index. No promises about tomorrow, but hey. That $167/mo in crypto a few years ago and you'd be a millionaire today. High growth means high risk. Crypto is high risk, and it has been high growth so far.

Also, I don't think he realizes that the mining network doesn't *need* to be as big as it is, since the difficulty adjusts to the total mining power in the pool. As long as there is enough for transactions to be processed efficiently, the currency will survive the caprice of energy companies. 
Which makes it not just the same, but actually far more robust than any other currencies, since it's globally-distributed.

What would 'indirectly' providing these things mean, exactly? It seems like this could be interpreted to mean that people can't use their bank accounts to send money to exchanges, but it also doesn't seem like the intent.

It's not a ponzi scheme because the point of bitcoin is not for it to increase in value. That's just a side effect of people realizing its potential for widespread use, which attracted speculators.

Also yeah, try to learn about the banking and business world as well so that you can share their perspective. 
As for demos, keep it simple. Maybe show them a paper wallet and how you can load it and unload it with your phone so they get that Bitcoin is just a value in a ledger that can be accessed with a key rather than some bit of code you have to download or something.

Yeah it's a difficult question to answer simply and I don't have one for you. I guess you'll have to think on that one as you read. To my mind a good answer would probably touch on 'it's a currency', 'quick, cheap, secure', 'global' and maaaaybe 'decentralized'.  
Definitely keep talking to these guys and maybe even do a run-through with them a few days before. A benefit of this is that they'll be well prepared for the meeting as well and will be able to contribute to discussions. 
Also, as another commenter mentioned, I do hope you'll get paid for this, but I have no idea how to broach that topic. Since you're consulting, not selling anything, I imagine they already intend to pay you, so hopefully they'll be the ones to bring it up! :)

Perhaps you should look at the exchanges. Surely if people have an answer for your question, it's the people actually buying and selling bitcoin, right? Just do what they're doing.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:36:05
Wow, that's a pretty cool opportunity. Im in no place to give advice so I will. 
I think your ability to answer questions will be just as, if not more important than the presentation itself, so be sure to leave time for that. To prepare for that, do a ton of reading. The Satoshi white paper is a good place to start, but also I'd suggest the bitcointalk forums and getting an idea for what people are likely to ask and how to answer them. 
One issue that you may want to mention briefly and be prepared to talk about in greater detail is scalability. There is currently a lot of FUD I see being spread about the block size limit, transaction rate limits, etc. The truth is, there doesn't seem to be a consensus on the best solution but the general idea is that new ideas will be vetted on altcoins and test networks and eventually be incorporated into the Bitcoin protocol in a hopefully seamless manner. 
In general, be confident but conservative. Don't try to sell them on 'Magic Internet Money', acknowledge the risks inherent in getting involved with Bitcoin at such an early stage and tell them how that risk can be managed. Bitcoin technology and software is at an early stage, som make sure they are aware of the potential uses. 
Finally, make sure to have a clear, succinct answer to the question 'what is Bitcoin?'  It should probably address the key points that it is a quick, cheap, global and secure method of sending money, details about the blockchain and private/public keys can be addressed elsewhere. 
I agree that it will also be important to talk about 'how not to use Bitcoin'. 
I'd be glad to take a look when you post it. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:53:40
I absolutely agree. The upshot of the price increase is that it's turning heads and might accelerate the development of the Bitcoin ecosystem. The downside is that much of the community is distracted by the bubble frenzy, but as they say, any press is good press.

I don't know how exactly these image QR's are generated, but it seems to me that it involves taking a source image and then somehow creating a public key which has the image plus a little randomness. The number of private keys which can make a public key QR with the image is much smaller than the total number of possible private keys.
If I were to take the same source image and QR generator that OP used and tried to generate my own versions of it, I imagine I would have better odds of coming up with the same public/private key pair than if there were no constraints on the output. But again, perhaps I'm wrong about this.

Looking for affirmation of your bullish views won't help you at all.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:51:37
Haha yeah, just a fun thought. Just had another (probably pretty silly) demo idea though. You could hand out identical paper wallets to show them the private/public key, perhaps load the address during the demo with a small amount, then tell them that the first person who figures out how to access the money and send it to an address they control gets to keep it. It's a little bit high schoolerish though, and you'd have to find the balance between 'enough to serve as an incentive to bank VPs' and 'awkwardly large sum'. But otherwise it seems like a good way to convey the concepts in Bitcoin. Better than 'hey look it's money I bought food with it', for sure. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:32:24
Personally I'd do closer to 25/75 split if you wanted to just try your hand at trading with some spare cash.

All I can think of is if you don't include enough transaction fees. Only problem I can think of is if you don't include enough miner's fee, but anything above $0.1 should be plenty.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:39:59
Makes sense. 
For a more serious suggestion, perhaps it would be good just to demonstrate a transaction between, say a phone wallet and an address you create in front of them. You could generate an address with the blockchain.info tools, go to its page, then send the money from your phone with the QR code. The page will automatically update with the transaction within seconds, which I imagine they'd find pretty cool. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:22:07
This is one thing that worries me. Bitcoin is useless if you don't have a phone or computer wallet with enough charge on it and a connection to the Internet (unless you do offchain transactions on a local WAN or something). 
With credit/debit cards the merchant needs a connection but the customer doesn't. 
Perhaps we're getting to the age where phone signal and a place to charge are something you need to deliberately seek out, but I do see this being a potential hindrance for adoption. Is there any sort of technology that would give the same functionality as cash, or at least debit cards to bitcoin?

I know that.
I'm saying that by constraining the output of your public/private key pair generator you are reducing the entropy, potentially enough to make a brute force attack possible.
But actually I did some more Googling and found an explanation for how this works: 
Basically, QR codes are made so that a scanner doesn't need to see every single pixel. I don't understand it fully, but it basically means that you can take a normal QR code and twiddle the bits around to make your desired image without completely destroying the encoded message. Therefore these image QR's are not any less safe than any other public keys.

I'm not an expert, but from what I understand if there are two chains of unequal length on the network, the shorter one isn't destroyed. The transactions on the smaller chain go back into the pool of unspent transactions to be added on to the end of the blockchain and are only discarded if the network detects a double-spend.
So transactions that previously had N confirmations would go back to being unconfirmed until they got added onto the new blockchain, which might (correct me if I'm wrong) open the possibility for double-spending in certain cases.

The bulls in those plots were right though. The influx of bulls came right at the start of the recent rise in value. And while the plots show an almost exponential increase in users, the bull ratio levels off, which goes against what you are saying.

Okay but the point is and the point of the comic reference was, this is not a reasonable extrapolation to make with such confidence:

He predicts a *maximum* market cap of $15bn *if* Bitcoin becomes a real player, which works out to $1250 per coin at the current 12MM coins. 
He clearly thinks that currently Bitcoin is not a major player and is not a significant store of wealth (and I would have to agree), so why would he think that it's currently worth $1300?
What's good is that he recognizes that it has legitimate potential to become those things and is in the long-term moderately bullish, but it's very clear to me that he thinks Bitcoin is currently overvalued. I also agree with that; a large portion of the current valuation is speculation on its future potential. The fundamental discrepancy between the market valuation and his is the market seems to think Bitcoin has a good chance of blowing that $15bn market cap out of the water when it matures.
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:49:33
No, saying 'we can't say for certain what will happen next' is not Shamanship. Shamanship is making predictions like 'bitcoin will rise exponentially for the next two years'. Besides, there are probably more examples of stocks etc which showed a period of exponential growth before leveling off or crashing than there are of those which continued to rise.
