Well there is fiat vs bitcoin - i'm assuming fiat customers will get their money back as they chose to hold it in a bank. No wiggle room there.
If there's any customer BTC left theres the issue of hacked BTC accounts vs not hacked BTC accounts.
This is definitely uncharted territory when it comes to traditional financial regulations (CFTC and NFA) as well as previous exchange hacks.
Traditionally, segregated accounts meant that individual customers were insulated from the firm's own balance sheet/financial distress as well as from other customers' defaults.
I wouldn't throw the word prison around when comes to this, because its clearly a civil bankruptcy issue.

fellow redditors, your priority should be getting the coins back. where have all the reddit detectives gone?
it does not benefit you to yell at bitfinex and force them to reveal such things. you're helping the thief.
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:57:29
this gets tricky if the note is denominated in bitcoin. if the bitcoin price goes up, their liability goes up too. if the liability is denominated in dollars, its worth a lot less to customers who lost BTC.

if you want them to file bankruptcy, the best way is to have everyone withdraw all their money when they re-open and never use them again.
otherwise, they can continue operating. you can sue them and collect a judgement against them but that will take months/years. Plus i'm guessing the only people with enough money to sue them in big boy court do not comment on reddit.

It looks like they are performing as rational actors in their strategy. Difficulty goes up, it becomes unprofitable for some percentage of miners, so they unplug their power hungry chips. The spiral of effects leads to the difficulty dropping, so they plug back in. I'm pretty sure Satoshi designed it this way.

When VC money is running out, companies typically cut people. I think we're far from that in this case. The [techcrunch article]( cited in CoinDesk's post provides a good perspective.
Regarding fees, there are many ways to buy bitcoin. Fees will likely go down over the next couple of years as the market expands.
How will bitcoin companies make money after fees inevitably decrease?
My guess is there are many companies trying to figure this out.

Here's some more info (on a timeline) about the current state of affairs in Belarus:
* 52% of Belarusian exports are to Russia, so it was surprising that for a while BYR was seemingly not affected by RUB slide.
* On December 18, President Lukashenko said on TV that "there will be no devaluation". People immediately got the clue and started panicking, demand for USD shot up.
* The next day, December 19, government announced '30% tax on purchases of foreign currency' and 'obligatory 50% sale of foreign currency revenues', while keeping official exchange rate low (~11000 BYR / 1 USD). 
* These decisions created black market immediately; you could buy USD from private people for ~15-20k BYR same day (30-80% intraday devaluation).
* People stormed stores, buying everything they could for BYR, especially electronics. Huge lines everywhere.
* Next day, December 20, government seized the domain name of the second-most popular website in the country, onliner.by. Official reason - they showed the prices for goods in dollars, instead of using local currency.
* The gov't seized domain names of 13+ smallish online stores with different official reasons.
* The gov't closed a major footwear store chain because 'they have too few Belarusian goods' on display.
* The gov't closed a home improvement store because somebody phoned and complained that they increased prices in BYR 30% overnight.
* Government issued an edict that forbids retailers to raise prices.
* Several other major news media, including naviny.by and gazetaby.com, are blocked and inaccessible.

On the upper left corner it says VWAP(21) indicating a VWAP over 21 candle sticks/time periods.
VWAP stands for volume weighted average price.
For example:
if you have 3 trades
10 BTC @ 389
100 BTC @ 395
1 BTC @ 375
the last price is 375
the simple moving average is 386.33
the vwap is 394.28
(389 * 10 + 395 * 100 + 375 * 1)/(10 + 100 + 1)
It is useful for getting the price at which most of the trading is happening.

The move by the Swiss National Bank to scrap its currency ceiling against the euro has ensnared foreign exchange brokers across the globe, from New York to London and New Zealand.
New York-based FXCM, one of the world’s biggest currency brokers, said it may be in breach of capital requirements after its clients suffered heavy losses on their Swiss franc trades.
In the UK, Alpari, a small retail forex broker, said on Friday it had entered into insolvency following the Swiss move. Most of its customers suffered losses that exceeded their account equity. “Where a client cannot cover this loss, it is passed on to us,” it confirmed.
Swissquote, the online broker, said on Friday that it would activate a provision of SFr25m ($28.5m) as the central bank’s decision “left clients with a negative balance”. However, it said that even with the provision its core tier one capital ratio was still about 17 per cent.
Denmark’s Saxo Bank warned its customers they could lose out from a review of Thursday’s trading. “Once we are better able to establish true market liquidity, all executed fills will be revisited, and will be revised and amended to more accurate levels,” it said. “This may result in a worse execution rate than the originally filled level.”
New Zealand-based broker Excel Markets said it had sustained the total loss of its operating capital following the SNB announcement, and would not be able to resume business. Interactive Brokers Group said due to the sudden move in the value of the Swiss franc several customers suffered losses in excess of their deposit with the fims. “Such debits amount to approximately $120m, less than 2.5 per cent of our net worth,” it said.
The announcements follow that of IG Group, which warned on Thursday it could face losses of up to £30m as a result of the currency gyrations. London Capital Group, a spread betting operator, said on Friday the impact of the currency gyrations on its balance sheet would “not exceed £1.7m”, an amount it said was not material.
Retail forex brokers have seen rapid growth in recent years as improvements in technology and the emergence of instant news sites such as Twitter have broadened access to the market. Some, such as Alpari and FXPro, have sponsored shirts of football teams. Many have focused on London, which is the world’s main hub for trading forex for institutional investors.
However they have attracted criticism for offering investors vast levels of leverage on their bets, a multiple that allows customers to trade far in excess of the deposit they post. The venue acts as the counterparty to the trade, taking on the risk.
Swiss franc against the euro
EU rules do not have caps for leverage and while some companies operate at ratio limits of 100 or 200 to 1, others will offer 500 times its underlying value. As a result, gains and losses are magnified.
A small profit can become a large one while a small loss can wipe out the investor very quickly. One consequence is that the churn of customers at the venue is often very high. By contrast, US regulators stipulate that companies must not exceed a limit of 50 times. UK regulators have also become concerned by EU rules that allow retail brokers that are overseen by other EU jurisdictions to “passport” their operations to the UK capital.
The SNB stunned markets on Thursday in one of the most dramatic currency interventions in decades as it abandoned a ceiling put in place in 2011, sending the franc soaring as much as 39 per cent against the euro. It was up 1.3 per cent against the euro on Friday morning at 1.02048.
FXCM, which is listed in New York, said late on Thursday that it had negative equity balances owed to the company of $225m, hours after the SNB’s action sent shockwaves through global currency markets.
“We are actively discussing alternatives to return our capital to levels prior to today’s events and discussing the matter with our regulators,” FXCM said in a statement.
Shares in FXCM fell 15 per cent on Thursday, and a further 12 per cent in after-hours trading. The company, which provides online trading for both retail and institutional investors, had a market capitalisation of $714m at the close of Thursday’s session.
The Swiss central bank move rattled foreign exchange markets worldwide.
Takako Masai, head of market research at Shinsei Bank, said although client exposures to the Swiss franc are small due to a lack of volatility with the yen, there were worries about side-effects from the removal of the cap.
“If the Swissie is no longer a choice for a safe haven, we could imagine that the yen could be more popular,” she said. “If the market moves that way, we have to be very careful about a back-up to the 110 level.”
The yen was trading at 116 against the dollar on Friday morning.
New Zealand’s Excel Markets said: “The majority of clients in a franc position were on the losing side and sustained losses amounting to far greater than their account equity. When a client cannot cover their losses it is passed on to us.”
David Johnson, director of Excel affiliate Global Brokers NZ, expressed “sincerest apologies” to shareholders for what he called a “devastating turn of events”.
“News of the impact of this event on companies and traders is just beginning to come to light,” he said.
Meanwhile, Citibank pointed out that the SNB’s defence of the SFr1.20 ceiling against the euro made it “a big buyer of eurozone bonds as it intervened in the currency market”.
It said the market was now expecting the European Central Bank to buy government bonds as part of the quantitative easing measures that could be announced next week, adding: “But if the QE announcement is a disappointment it could lead to a lot of pain.”
A note from Fitch, the rating agency, drew attention to the implications of the SNB’s action on the profitability of the Swiss banking sector.
“Appreciation of the Swiss franc will probably have a greater effect on profitability than directly on the banks’ balance sheets and regulatory capital and leverage ratios.
“Many banks, including the country’s two largest and many larger private ones, generate a high proportion of revenue in foreign currency, whereas a larger proportion of operating costs are in Swiss francs. Some banks hedge their income statement against foreign currency moves, but many do so only partly or not at all. This will put pressure on earnings reported in Swiss francs. Private banks, with a typically larger Swiss franc cost base, are likely to be most affected.”

@_date: 2016-11-23 16:59:36
the mempool size varies from 1-5MB. in the past two days it has sky rocketed to 40+ MB.
as others have mentioned this is likely an attack on the network, and/or someone trying to make a point

yup, i see your point. this could easily be traffic on the freeway vs an attack on the network.
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:14:18
Look at the rapid increase two days ago 
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:22:38
the mempool is a bucket of transactions not yet included in blocks.
usually it has 1-5MB of transactions in it, and assuming each transaction has an appropriate fee, each block is found every ~10 minutes and maxed out at 1MB, at any given point the mempool will clear out within 10-50 minutes (depending on size of mempool).
now that the mempool is abnormally large (not the first time either) it's taking much longer to process all of the queued transactions.
given the three input variables (time between blocks, block size and fee), holding time and size constant -&gt; avg fees go up.
this could be due to increased demand by folks trying to move  bitcoin, a denial of service attack on the network, and/or miners holding block size at 1mb to push up their average fee per block to make more revenue.
another possibility is that someone is trying to measure the elasticity of demand on bitcoin. in other words, at what point do people stop using bitcoin due to high fees?
@_date: 2016-11-23 20:50:05
users have to pay much more to have transactions clear within X number of blocks
see: 
two days ago the recommended fee for immediate inclusion was 80 sat/byte. today its 100.

These threads pop up weekly.
Coinbase, Circle, etc all see ridiculous amounts of fraud. Why? When you sell a non-reversible form of money for a reversible form of money you will get people trying to exploit the reversible part. This usually involves phishing or buying Wells Fargo bank accounts and then trying to buy bitcoin w. them. Coinbase only needs your name and address according to the Bank Secrecy Act.
They need your SSN if you're doing a significant amount of volume.
So in summary, this data collection is to fight fraud, not invade privacy.

After reading his interview with the FT yesterday. I created an account on MMM global and tried to see what the process was to make a deposit. Unfortunately, he doesn't host wallets. he lets users provide their own deposit addresses.
Quite an interesting site overall. Scary nonetheless.

guys, this isnt for aml/kyc. It is to prevent fraud.  For every honest customer there is a ring of eastern european criminals trying to buy bitcoin with stolen accounts bought on the darknet.
circle doesnt want to lose money.
if you want btc semi instantly, wire someone money. Yes you'll pay more but life has trade-offs.

no, they're very different things albeit with some overlap. KYC is used by the government to fight money laundering and general surveillance on the financial system. historically used to stop drug cartels by following the money.
fraud prevention by collecting the data mention by OP by circle, coinbase and others is to stop business losses due to other kinds of fraud like account takeover, man in the middle and friendly fraud.

nope, the address sent funds to another address that then combined that outgoing payment along with many others. usually exchanges do that. 
that 22k very likely has nothing to do with the original address

I'm having a hard time believing that TD made no indication that this was a check vs cash. But even in the case that they didn't, why did you make that assumption?
Now that you did and lost a significant amount of money on your mistake, why are you suing the bank for whats clearly your mistake?
After doing some research, its clear that you are trying to start some sort of [political career related to Bitcoin](
FYI, posting on reddit is not the best way to find a lawyer. By posting this here you're hoping people will pat you on the back for suing an (evil) bank for your own mistake/foolish trading decision on what i assume is LocalBitcoins or other platform rife with risk and fraudsters.
I know Canada is not a large country population-wise, but i recommend finding a bigger platform for your political aspirations. Digital currency/money creation just isn't a big enough issue (yet).
Also, make sure you turn on 2FA on your online wallets. Bitcoin companies wont offer you $500 if you sue them.

those are actually medeco locks, which have special keys, so if they can be picked, it won't be easy.

the other thing he tweeted is not in bitsig.io
its possible someone who follows him on twitter posted it on bitsig.io
the transaction is.. small. even if he posted it to bitsig himself, who cares? nothing nefarious about SS using crypto.
@_date: 2016-10-11 17:19:32
in general of course. but in this case, the bank secrecy act does not mandate SSN, driver's license unless the amounts are large. selfie is purely for fraud prevention.
@_date: 2016-05-13 21:26:28
from his perspective hes right. if he understood how bitcoin works i think he would have a different opinion.
understanding how bitcoin works involves:
* the blockchain
* open source application development
* mining
* proof of work
* scarcity

So they use your login pw to encrypt the shared key? or an additional password?
edit: also, if someone had access to their servers, couldn't they just wait for users to enter their passwords and get the 2nd key?
I thought multisig was always about having three different keys in three different places.
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:52:27
I believe the practical reason for this is to prevent their wallets from being used as a mixing service.
@_date: 2015-02-21 22:35:59
I would actually say that its for fraud not compliance.
@_date: 2016-07-28 19:44:19
so no one uses it?

in the other message thread you mentioned you didnt notice your account's 'available funds' balance and that someone with more experience wouldn't have made that mistake.
everyone who's traded large amounts of bitcoin has lost money somehow, the longer you've been in the space the more likely thats true.
Bitcoin unveils our traditional financial system's flaws. Abusing the legal system because of a user error on your side is a waste of time.
TD bank did not steal the money from you, theres no expectation that they should cover your loss. This is just the way life works unfortunately.
Lick your wound and move on.

I'm sorry but a cursory google search yields all of [TD Bank Canada's deposit codes](
**GC** = **TD Canada Trust Access Card Transaction (Other Branch)**
You have no case against TD for this mistake. you should take the $500.

If you login and go to [gocelery.com/ and put in 1 BTC, you'll see that we're paying higher than spot price after fees.

"never sell for a lower price"... shockingly bad trading advice. trading is all about risk management and not going broke.

I'm happy that Mike is excited about bitcoin but didn't like how he compared "one way" virtual currencies typically used in the gaming world to bitcoin. From a regulatory and practical view, they are very dissimilar.
