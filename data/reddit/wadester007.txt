I was thinking about every time I needed gas I was going to spend what I spent on gas on that amount of Bitcoin and just see what happens in a couple of years
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:29:10
I never paid.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:43:15
Don't move it. What's that mean.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:49:57
Holy shit. You lost me. I'll read it a bunch and try to understand. Don't I need a wallet to buy these coins and is a wallet a app or website or both? And work all this transport transfer stuff I know there's fees with transferring

Just saw this post this case says wallet on the package. I guess this is a wallet I keep hearing about

Can you buy just like 10 or $20 worth of bitcoin and if so where from?
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:55:41
Where can( is a good place ) you buy them from?
The wallet you use is that a app basically?
What's this about transferring and what's bad about it?
What was that EHG or whatever you were talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:25:19
Can you buy half of a Bitcoin or like $70 worth of a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:34:19
Thanks!!!! How and where can I buy and how and where do you hold them?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:29:38
Is it hard to keep track of how much you have is there an app to do that or is there another better way?
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:18:04
I don't really want to buy anything at the moment rather learn first be smart then maybe buy
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:18:58
So there's no wallet. I keep seeing people in Bitcoin forums talking about a wallet
@_date: 2019-08-05 04:28:31
How do I get a bitcoin wallet?
