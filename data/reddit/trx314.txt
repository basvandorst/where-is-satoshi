You really dont get the economics of the transaction.
The haircut is 30%, which means that unless the collateral value drops more than 30% relatively to the loan value, you are doing a gift to the lender if you dont reimburse the loan.
The lender, on his side, can call the collateral as soon as its value drops below 100% of the loan amount. 
There is no need of a lawyer to enforce this, it is automatically managed by the smart contract.

They still need deposits, even if the loan emission is leveraged

You can already get a p2p loan on ETHLend. Just need metamask and a token as collateral. Super easy.

I think you did not get it. There is no such "they" being a lender. These are peer-to-peer loans, 100% defined by smart contracts. The lender can indeed call the collateral if its value decreases below 100% of the loan. The borrower can reimburse the loan to avoid this situation, and in future version the borrower will also be able to increase the collateral in order to keep the haircut at non-callable level. Seems complicated but if you try to use it it is actually pretty simple.

No, if you borrow 70 you have to put 100 of collateral. 
This is the definition of a haircut, the collateral value is higher than the loan amount at inception, in order to mitigate the risk of volatility of the collateral value.

I used an analogy to show how the same kind of ethical justification can lead to absurd results.
To come back to the initial context, what else do hackers use? Computer, keyboard, electricity, internet, cryptography, ... does it mean that investing in any of these areas would lead to a conflict of interest for him?
Crypto is only a mean of value transfer in this case. The fact of investing in crypto does not directly help the hackers in their activity. If you begin to take into account indirect effects, then you cannot invest in anything, otherwise it would always lead to an ethical dilemma.

Google is a bad example, the IPO was in 2004, years after the dot com crash

Exactly, you will not be able to request a loan if you do not send the right amount of collateral (loan amount + haircut). 
This is a common practice in finance, i don't think the mob asks for collateral as they basically have life power on the borrower.
I encourage you to study a little bit the subject, beginning with Wikipedia:

I agree, his argument does not make sense, otherwise he should not even own USD because USD is used for drug dealing...
