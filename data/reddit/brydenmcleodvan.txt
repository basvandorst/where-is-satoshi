I understand the system works blockchain, mining ect. 
Just wanting some advice on picking a decent wallet that may also support litecoin and an exchange to purchase coins with ease.

Your right, no one is actually taking the time to look up this on google, if they did they’d know Soros Fund stayed they’ve invested in the crypto space
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:01:09
A good wallet that holds both bit and lite!
Easily transfers to cold storage hardware!
A good place to buy coins that avoids market trading (I don't care about trading) just purchasing, holding and spending!
@_date: 2016-06-29 23:50:55
Fair enough, I know I was reaching when asking for a wallet that supports both cryptos. Just have to accept I'll need more ten one wallet, thank you:)
Side note, the Trezor does hold both lite and bit.
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:03:18
P.S. Something that supports Can $
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:43:51
It's tricky stuff, trying to find the right market to purchase is a needle in a haystack
@_date: 2017-01-08 05:16:14
I agree, I haven't bought any Bitcoin yet (just getting in for the long) but I did pick up a keepkey for cold storage... I'm a newb and even I know cold storage is the way... Trust no one!
@_date: 2016-06-29 20:55:50
I am trying to get started with a good wallet that supports both Bitcoin and Litecoin. I have a Trezor for cold storage but trying to jump all the hoops is frustrating and confusing!!!! I'm lost, I don't care about trading and I'm Canadian HELP ME!

What must happen first for Bitcoin to be considered "Out Of The Bottle?"
@_date: 2016-11-06 12:13:30
What is the Genesis Block?
@_date: 2016-12-11 17:40:18
I used circle because it was pretty user friendly 
(had a lot of trouble with others like kraken)
Now that I'm on the hunt for a new platform to purchase coins which is the next friendliest 
@_date: 2016-12-24 21:19:57
I have a question!
I bought a keepkey it's set up. 
Issue 1: I am in Canada, I have trouble finding an exchange that works well considering our dollar is not US and there are restrictions that make it hard navigating Bitcoin on my side of the boarder!
Issue 2: Most exchanges require a cell phone number like Circle for text verification (rip circle). But I do not have a cell phone (CRAZY I KNOW) but I live rural which means no cell service so what's the point? How do I overcome this hurdle?
Issue 3: If I can find an exchange that works and fits my needs how do I transfer my bitcoin to my keepkey from that exchange?
Thank You! ��
@_date: 2016-12-25 07:27:57
Keepkey is a cold storage wallet, thanks man much appreciated. I'll check it out!
@_date: 2019-10-13 20:27:29

Thank you kindly, I really appreciate the explanation

Bummer lol, one can dream I guess! 50 coins for 600 sounded to good to be true anyway :)
@_date: 2016-09-26 20:02:38
ELI5 what soft or hard forks are in Bitcoin or any crypto means?
@_date: 2016-09-27 22:03:52
Let me see if I get this straight. I can bid on these 50 coins??? How can I place a bid?
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:21:01
I think your looking at this in the wrong light..
If the Venezuelan government destabilizes which it did then the currency is worth nothing which it’s not, 00.10 to the U.S. Dollar. Then food and clothing become unaffordable and people starve and riot and revolt.
Venezuela is the second largest oil producer in the world, it should not be this poor and almost a decade ago its value was on par with the Canadian Dollar.
Point being if a Venezuelan held bitcoin since its inception his “Bitcoin Fiat” value would have risen while his Government issued money declined because one “Ledger” is more effective then the other and less likely to have crooked political agenda attach manipulating the curriences from behind closed doors!

How do I go about obtaining a paper wallet? Is it just a paper note printed from a Bitcoin ATM?
@_date: 2017-05-08 23:42:51

WHHAAAATTTTT! Well that's not cool! It's on apples App Store, has anyone over at kraken dressed this issue?

So if I can't exchange my USD on Bitsquare for Bitcoin in a P2P transaction, 
Then what exactly is the association between Bitcoin and Bitsquare? 
@_date: 2016-07-19 16:56:42
Well the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF was filed in 2013 and has sat stagnet for three years. As of this month they are closing the filing with SEC for NYSE and have opened a filing with Bats global market which is the second biggest market in North America, also the largest stock exchange to hold majority on ETF's.
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:24:04
When you say to use "it" are you referring to  Bitsquare  
Or one of the other exchanges we talked about?
@_date: 2016-07-19 17:04:27
Personally I think it's taken so long for them because The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust does not offer insurance on lost or stolen Coins due to hackers or data corruption. It could also be because SolidX has filed with SEC for there own ETF in the Bitcoin market, even though they are new, they offer Insurance on all Coins they hold for buyers.
2013 to 2016... Nothing! July 11 2016 talks have "Re Emerged"

Personally I'm a saver, but some people spend money no matter its form just because they can, you obviously haven't met my wife!
@_date: 2016-07-13 23:11:31
What are people's thoughts on the winklevoss twins Bitcoin etf??? Just heard they re opened the discussion with SEC
@_date: 2016-07-19 17:17:50
Honestly I don't think it will ever become a currency, I do however see it as an investment.
Bitcoin is a funny thing, it was created to be a currency but it's rarely used as currency given the obstacles of mass adoption. However it's value has done nothing but appreciate due to the limited amount and the halvings as they come. I disagree it's not a Longterm investment as it seems to be less day to day traded currency and more digital gold.
