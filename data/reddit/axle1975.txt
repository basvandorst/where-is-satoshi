It takes 3 days for bank to transfer aud to international exchange.  Aussies prefer to pay a premium to get bitcoin now rather than miss out on 3 days of rocketing prices

The trouble with correlation is that it doesn't say anything about causation. What makes you think everything is following bitcoin and not buttcoin?

Not certain how this works but i assume each note is loaded with a public key and the private key is then burned, or maybe embedded in the note so you can sweep the funds if you want.
Im just wondering whats to stop an unscrupulous note manufacturer from printing multiple notes with the same key?  I guess users only accept notes issued by a trusted manufacturer? ... Incentive to create forgeries of the trusted manufacrurers notes?   Do we lose a few of the benefits of crypto by using these notes?

Ah yeah i see it! It went down and then up and then down and then up and then down again and then up again and then again down.  That must mean that after its finished going down its going to go up! And probably after that when its finished going up its going to go down again ...
Mmm mebe i just go back to my rubics cube its a little less predictable

I'd ignore advice from kraken too.  Bunch of clowns you'd have to be an even bigger moron to rely on them for anything more than a jumble sale

Hear! hear! Last night i bleed money while kraken gives me error messages. Finally got fed up and took me 30 mins and as many more error messages and timeouts to get my money off their shitty severs

On a tangent, I get the point that they only hurt themselves by spoofing user agent.  But i'm curious about the reference to game theory.  Explain a bit more how it relates to game theory?

Very thought provoking analysis.  Makes sense to me up to the "physical" money level. But once you start to count eg value of real estate i think now one starts to consider bitcoin as a unit of account and i don't think its correct to apply a 21 million btc cap in that case. ie its fun, but naive to divide total real estate usd into 21 million btc to find the hypothetical btc price.
Instead maybe one has to consider what would happen to total real estate value if all real estate were to come on the market at once?  Of course in that case real estate price would tank both in usd and btc (presumably to much less than total "physical" usd and less than 21 million btc respectively)
