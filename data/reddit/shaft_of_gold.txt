Oh right, do you not cash out your PayPal funds to your bank account?

Who's your CC gateway provider? Can't see any details about it on the website 
Also, I can't get passed the email check field when filling out form to buy 15 USD of BTC. Doesn't seem to like anything I put it in there

They stop trading after 7% moves, be that down or up.

How so? Setup your own payment gateway to take fiat? 
Personally I use Stripe payments via its integration with Waveapps, my fiat customers get an invoice with a button on it that lets them pay me with credit card straight away

Uh, nah Greg. Come on m8....
Make purchase button &gt; next &gt; choose BTC &gt; next &gt; put in 15 USD (BTC automatically filled out) &gt; put in wallet address &gt; put in email address &gt; at no stage is it possible to click the next button

Ok well to be honest, I read your initial post as "$15 no verification required" so I thought I'd test it out.
It's not clear from the front page of the website nor from the buy screens that you must be verified before purchasing anything....
Good luck!

seems to be going quiet smoothly, good work John!

page 40 of the prospectus...

Stay away from Coinjar, use [Bit Trade Australia](
@_date: 2013-09-20 08:27:38
will do!

ok thanks for the info, im not sure how i feel about the branding to be honest. i know you guys went for modern and futuristic, but yellow and black ... unsure. 
i guess the colour choice was to play on the Bee side of things

Hi Danny,
RE: the current branding that appears in your prospectus - is that the final artwork/look and feel?
RE: the website - i dont see any mention of a website?
@_date: 2013-09-20 04:44:20
interesting, what is the best way to get in contact with you about this? 
@_date: 2013-09-20 04:17:53
haha, nice!
@_date: 2013-09-20 08:42:24
thanks for the reply. 
1. I guess I just want to see some examples of their work and/or portfolio. Wont hold me back from investing as I think this adventure you're on is important and exciting, more curious then anything else
2. would be great if you could post semi live updates/daily reports during your visit to Amsterdam (business hours only though!) - if you get time that is

The Bee card payment network is very interesting to me (especially the dual card/QT code functionality), i have a few questions:
1. Who are Pittas &amp; Valerkos, from my quick Google search they don't seem to exist on the internet - do you have any information about them that you can share?
2.  In the prospectus this line is on page 10: "following a Sept 16th meeting, further details will be added to this section" - are there any further updates from this meeting regarding Bee?

How does one buy shares in asicminer? I can only find pass through shares, but not really sure I understand what those are. :(
