Kind of a dick post. You don't see me talking about how much your car depreciated after you drove it off the lot.

Does it really matter? Do you have a need to know. Are you going to fix the vulnerability? Sounds like a bigger disaster to make it known how the compromise happened. Move your coins off stamp if you're still scared. Oh wait...you don't have coins. YOURE JUST HERE TO TROLL.

Best way to get people interested is tell them that they shouldn't do something.  Everyone knows that

There are countless reasons to understand bitcoin and its utility. It may go down in history as one of the greatest inventions of our generation. For the common US citizen right now, the answer to "why" bitcoin is very simple...each bitcoin could potentially be worth Walter White cash in the near future.

Apple is the premier tech company in the world. Bitcoin is a new currency/technology that has a lot to prove...but with huge potential be it. Its apples to oranges

I feel like this is less than half of the story...what about the fall of Mt Gox?

Bitcoin is about anything you want it to be. It's an clean slate still 6 years after creation.

The weed industry is big enough that if it did get into Bitcoin, the Bitcoin price would make significant long term gains thereby solving their problem that it isn't a good store of value.

Not a drug user, but it needs to change quickly. Locking people up for illegal drug use makes their lives and societies burden several layers worse.
