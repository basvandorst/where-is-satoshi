@_date: 2017-12-09 13:00:47
lol dude, don't be fucking paranoid.
Meet up at a bank close to a police station
see him withdraw from the bank
sell it
put your cash in the bag
walk out and hail the first taxi home or just take your car home.
arrive and sleep on it like a baby.
How hard can that be?

i seriously hope it dips
i need to get in on bitcoin, regretting so much for not getting in earlier and getting in and chickening out.

How tf did you initiate the trade if you don't know who he is?
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:48:01
Because I fear this dip might be permanent
I invested way too much and I am young(20) so kinda my entire savings from work.

contact the support, provide proof that you didn't receive the money(screenshots etc or whatever they demand) or contact the guy you sold the bitcoins to.

Pharmaceutical goods mostly on the black market since it was $500, should have invested instead of buying goods for a "pay with btc 20 off" discount

i thought the future scare was over after CBOE releasing bitcoin futures and the price hiked etc so why are they scared of CME??
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:03:43
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:23:57
Just sell your bitcoin for cash irl instead of online aka 0 tax
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:28:22
I hodled during the CBOE crashes(I Invested at 12.5k per btc) so i am hodling through CME, i just want to know the reasoning other than "zoom out" etc
