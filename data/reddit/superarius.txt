Perhaps you don't. The hardware wallet seems like current industry standard if you want full custody of your own crypto, and you want to make sure its not lost or stolen (easy to lose desktop wallets if a machine dies or is lost, and easy to get hacked phished etc. if using a "hot" wallet). But I am interested in alternative solutions!

multi party computation is usually in a threshold setting. All the parties have to communicate with each other in order to compute the signature, but a certain number of parties can be unreachable (or even arbitrarily malicious) and the honest parties can still compute.

i.e. you could have a wallet with 10 total signers but requiring 7 signers to participate in signing. Any 7 parties will do but those 7 will have to all communicate with each other p2p

certainly a possibility. Also possible that they are not dead but still the keys to many of the earliest untouched addresses are lost

definitely they'd use mixing of some sort. we're talking about god-level cryptography ppl/person who definitely will use best practices in security and privacy for whatever actions they take

thanks for the link.

true but if the coins ever move in the future it would still be really interesting. Definitely a lot of governments etc. would immediately track the movement of the coins and quickly identify who is behind the movement at that point - the sophistication of de-anonymizing the blockchain is WAY beyond what it was in 2009.

it could potentially be adapted to be asynchronous, though classically MPC protocols happen with all parties online simultaneously for execution.

obviously its not anonymous... what I meant by this phrase (though its true its worded badly) is if the coins were to move now they would very easily and obviously be traced to the transacting parties almost immediately. If they had moved in 2009 and continued to move from there, it would be much more difficult to know everything about all the transacting parties for the history of those coins
@_date: 2019-10-18 07:52:38
Sounds plausible. Certainly it was and remains a smart choice to be anonymous.
@_date: 2019-10-18 07:43:29
correct! Thank u!

Certainly they could be dead. But if they are alive it's pretty interesting to be hiding from the world when you are sitting on such a large amount of valuable assets...
@_date: 2019-10-18 07:43:05
completely. I definitely consider this- there's no reason to "cash out" to fiat if you believe in bitcoin more, and of course the creators would -- but then still you might move and spend and transact some of these coins at some point even if its on the bitcoin chain. That hasn't happened
@_date: 2019-10-18 13:19:16
wow, rly wish I hadn't said verifiably! :)
@_date: 2019-10-18 08:15:23
agreed this is the most reasonable guess, and its very sad that this man who was at the very least an important contributor in the very early stages of bitcoin (I mean... he received the first transaction) died young and was not able to see the enormous growth that came to the network so quickly thereafter. However he claims not to be satoshi and you'd think that if he really was it would have been identified somehow?
@_date: 2019-10-18 07:48:14
correct but wouldn't the creator who believes it will be a powerful, disruptive project be protective with their keys?
@_date: 2019-10-20 14:28:15
A good amount of tidbits here I had not yet stumbled across. Thanks again for the thorough and friendly responses :).  


This is an interesting topic. I rly don't know enough to have any opinion on that, but I do believe that it's very important to track the changes in the ecosystem and context as much as the protocol itself (I know that's not a novel idea, but I'm sure there are some hard line crypto purists who may disagree and say 'only the protocol matters'). An example is that earlier price movements coupled with the meme of "hodl"-ing, (i.e. the idea of price speculation as a central part of bitcoin, and this idea entering the mainstream) is partially what led us to the festival of altcoin speculation, and this has had effects on the entire direction of cryptocurrency. Themes like this matter.

yeah I know my original post seems very conspiracy theory-esque (thus all the badgering) but that was mostly an unwise decision to catch a bit of attention. I guess my real interest, and why I turned to reddit, was to learn more about bitcoins early history and prehistory.  It's not about the gains, its about the set of decisions at the beginning (like the decision to stay anon) that were able to spark and bootstrap bitcoin into the powerful thing that it is today. Of course most of that is simply due to the power of the protocol itself (i.e. the power of math, the white paper etc.) but there were some key decisions. A developer community had to come together to become bitcoin-core. There was funding through the bitcoin foundation. Things like that. And there's a lot we don't know due in part to the mystery around satoshis identity. For instance we can know next to nothing about the development period before any code was posted to sourceforge.


Completely echo what you say about the mentality (i for one can't care much about gains, i don't really hold much crypto anyway). My interest is really in the implications of P2P technology form the widest perspective. There's a lot of noise in blockchain these days because of the possibility of explosive gains. Many things were much more clear "in the early days" (when I was not around) and I think there are still many lessons to learn from information about that time, that context, how cypherpunks and open source and an entire ecosystem were able to birth bitcoin.

and yes thats right. Its multi signature but:  
1. you save blockspace (tx fees, gas etc.) because you end up with a single signature  
2. more private (individual signers are not visible on chain)  
3. more extensible (no limitations on the number of signers because of protocol restrictions)
@_date: 2019-10-18 07:46:41
yeah... thats true :/ my bad. I am 100% a reddit noob and new to the community. SO when I'm reading this on wikipedia: "At bitcoin's peak in December 2017, these were **worth** over US$19 billion, making **Nakamoto** possibly the 44th richest person in the world at the time" it's complete BS?
@_date: 2019-10-18 07:51:35
there are some ways. For instance there are 50 bitcoins in the address from the genesis block which pretty much necessarily makes them satoshi's. They have not moved.
