The flooring isnt sealed so the space between the pennies would have resin contacting the wood. Where the resin is touching the floor it would soak into the wood. Those pieces of wood would come up with the rest of it.

I completely missed that in the video. Thank you, that would certainly make a huge difference.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:04:25
Its a nightmare. That massive thick resin will be a huge pain to remove. Probably need to air chisel it which is going to destroy the sub floor so it will need replaced as well.

They did have a big dip at the end of last year but their stocks recovered.
@_date: 2019-07-01 06:17:57
A recovering stock is usually a decent indicator for company performance. While you are correct they are not equal there is a reasonable correlation.

Snapchat is huge in most countries outside the US...I don't see it going bankrupt. Financially they are at doing fine.

With an antminerS9 + power + fees and overhead 
You need bitcoin above 4.5k to be making money. Obviously there is a recovery period to pay for the hardware and power is location dependent but miners should be pretty effective at these levels.

Just the opposite. Poor people need to get rich and due to their lack of funds they need to be careful to use them in the most beneficial ways.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:17:29


ok, I'm following you ....


but a stock that shows growth means it is about to go bankrupt? 


Weird cause I got downvoted for pointing out that while they think the company is doom its stock has revored and shown strong growth rates recently, but apparently I am an idiot and know nothing about it. 
Eh, whatever I don't care. So what if they are doing well in other markets. Admittedly they have under performed in the US where we heavily use sms apps while many countries charge per sms so data based chat apps do better. Its in those places where they are succeeding but I don't  get any of this as has been pointed out so rebounding stocks probably mean nothing.

Well currently if there isn't an atm they can't deposit it into a standard bank without a financial record of the event.
Allowing bitcoin to be purchased through any legal means besides cash greatly limits the ability for money laundering. Obvious trading bit coin for illegal goods or service still exists but is off topic for the initial question.


I am not the one aiding in a criminal activity, but if I was it would be a moral question I would want to answer before proceeding. 
Now I understand it maybe as simple as libX doesn't feel they have a responsibility to it or that they do in some way attempt to prevent it, hell they might intentionally target high crime areas where they might get more business, but my question was directly related to OPs photo regarding the concern of it happening.
@_date: 2019-10-26 18:07:19
In pretty much any context. Torture works. It does not make it ok. The ends should never be the justification for the means. Unfortunately we live in a world where they often are.
@_date: 2019-02-10 06:19:15
You are correct I was assuming based on your link a single one was making $33 a before electrical costs.
and yeah $1/day wouldn't be worth the effort. 
Although a lot of the hotels do have a 220 plug for the ac if it is plugged in in the room...sadly thats usually in the rurlal areas or cheap hotels...not really worth hauling it about to guess it if is used.
Thank you for the response.
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:31:43


The problem with torture is it 100% effective. You will give up anything, even lie. Anything that can be verified is at risk if you are facing a situation where they have unlimited access.
now sure they may not hold to true for a US citizen in country but lets not ignore the fact many countries are in all out protest and being murder or hauled of to concentration camps.
We make jokes about people getting away from chinese currency to bitcoin but its easier for them to torture you and take it than from a real bank.
@_date: 2019-06-06 15:40:31
Sure and I agree they are horrible people as well, but my money laundering at that scale was generally reserved for organized crime and large operations. Less street gang hitman and more selling missiles to south america. Not that both aren't bad, just that one will hit closer to home for most users.
@_date: 2019-06-06 05:47:58
What if anything is to prevent criminals from using them to launder money?
I mean sure real banks launder money for the big guys, and I'm sure cartels have a favorite bank...but is there any way to prevent to prevent criminals from abusing the system?
@_date: 2019-06-06 15:37:25
I didn't mean this as a jab at you or the companies doing it but while I do fully support crypto and the disassociation from banks and governments it worries me what atrocities can now be completed due to the simplicity of laundering it. 
I was honestly curious if there was any steps that could be taken to reduce that risk, while still providing the service.  I guess the downvotes and indirect answers are an answer of sorts.

About your s9j's...
How big/heavy are they?
I travel for work and am in a hotel 250 days a year...
I could probably plug one in for 9ish hours a day while I was at work, assuming putting in in my luggage would be doable. 
@_date: 2019-04-15 15:47:33
Yeah, they really need a way to get less than $20 out...
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:52:30
but do you trust veraCrypt? Its just a clone of truecrypt which with the way they quit I have huge doubts in the security of the encryption mechanisms.

The problem with the top gear one was how it was done. They wrote a script saying the car failed long before they ever saw the car.
They flat out lied about its performance and tesla even sued them over it.

I have it and another one saved to post for when people throw out the stupid...both parties are the same.
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:02:52
Sure but they had not had the experience when they wrote it. Nor did they necessarily have that experience while driving it.
I agree the early concepts were rough as hell but that doesnt excuse them for badmouthing something they have never seen.
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:54:32
Sure but they intentionally denounced a vehicle with no experience while passing it off as common place. Justifying it with, yeah but they always do that is not a good excuse.

Can we get one with a little more border?
