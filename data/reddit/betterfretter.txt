Until you realize he didn't make you wait while he spent your coins before you could. Ignorance in muggers is eternal.

He probably thinks he's hurting the pound and helping bitcoin, but he just made everyone holding pounds slightly wealthier.

The transaction has appeared in blockchain.info so it did hit the network. I'm not sure I want to contact the seller who seemed to want to remain anonymous and ask him to rebroadcast or explain how to do that. 
This is interesting to me because the wallet I use (Bitcoin for Android version 3.24 by Andreas Schildbach) doesn't let me specify a transaction fee (apparently it's calculated automatically according to comments on a bug filed). 
The bitcoin-qt client lets you specify a per KB transaction fee. I would like every wallet I use to let me do this because it should lead to a speedier transaction e.g. if I'm receiving $200K in bitcoins (I'm not) then I don't mind kicking in a $50 transaction fee for the sender to include to get the BTC immediatelly and get priority over everyone else. But if it's a starbucks latte then I won't pay any fee. Just seems like selecting a fee is a critical part of BTC which wallets haven't implemented  or are doing automatically. 
Having said all that, I can answer my own question: Confirmation is currently taking 4 hours and 40 minutes if you don't include any transaction fee. My transaction was just completed.

Thanks. My question though is what is the current delay for zero fee transactions. What are other traders seeing right now or during the last few days?

Thanks. I'm assuming this is what you're talking about:
I'm bummed more folks haven't taken an interest in this post. US banks seem to be standing shoulder to shoulder creating a wall to prevent bitcoin acceptance. So I was hoping to gather some info on how to get around that.
