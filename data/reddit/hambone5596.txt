To be 100% in this comment I find 90% of Alts complete bs.

I don't understand how you're coming up with those numbers... if you attempted to buy 18000 coins by the 30th coin price would start to rise (in theory)
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:38:48
It's the power of being a bank and gaining monetary value to the people. When more money is in a financial institution it should be worth more money. Banks make money on my money. With crypto at this point in time the more people people advocating it and using it the more value our currency will carry.

Nothing is easier then Coinbase. If you're in the US you take a selfie upload your ID and buy crypto it's that simple.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:29:33
What I don't understand is why anyone uses anything besides Coinbase. Besides the segwit fiasco Coinbase is hands down the absolute best exchange. Every single day I check Reddit I see bittrex and bitstamp I believe holding 100s coins hostage.

@_date: 2017-12-01 22:03:02
Use Coinbase or gdax. Simplistic and easy.

Remind me in 2 months
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:28:35
Yup submitted it before I even linked my card 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:07:19
Not so much lose but you made a decent sized transaction. Ll
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:28:29
How does market cap not  control actual coin value no matter what? trade volume could be zero if 250 billion is in bitcoin the volume of trade should be completely irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:18:58
so will this allow a transaction between block chains as well?
For example .05 btc 2ltc in one block transaction??
also why would it kill other altcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:20:35
Isn't the ledger top tier anyway? It's pretty much that or Trezor.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:50:50
I leave X amount on Coinbase. As soon as I swipe my card I'm charged the exact amount in USD.  No fees no nonsense. This is not my extreme goal of using crypto from me to merchant but, for the time being before wide spread adoption on the merchant level this is as close to perfect as it could get. I'm currently living a highly risky financial life style with having near 90% of my financials in crypto but I'm young if it were to plummet I could always start using fiat again as o have very close to zero overhead. If you have bills and a real life I do not recommend  it as I've watched several thousand disappear in seconds. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:07:31
Exactly this. If everyone was showing complete faith in the tech and not just trying to make money we would be in the 50k margin in less then a year 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:35:43
Wow I've been enlightened. Gonna check these for my self. But I've never had a single issue with them haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:27:40
Fuck that, fuck you and fuck ver. You shills want to be friendly advocate for a different name.

That's what happens when you try to support thieves and companies trying to deceive others.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:27:56
Yes  and my accounts money was withdrawn 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:33:24
I will 500% back what you are saying as soon as they drop bitcoin from the name because they are NOT bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-17 08:16:26
Tldr:A: robinhood gold zero custodial crypto.
        B: you are buying a number and selling it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:32:30
At this second wait a few hours.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:07:03
Not so much lose but you made a decent sized transaction. Ll
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:06:59
If you paid attention to your app you would have seen the maintenance for two hours
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:30:57
So you bought 2k  at 10k lol just buckle for the ride lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:41:18
100x this. Bitcoin doesn't need to have every single transaction. It doesn't need to be the only form of value exchange. It's why every nation has there own fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:40:03
but can it really? at that point the whole market cap was hardly 15B 
we are currently near 400b. Also wasnt that partially when mtgox went belly up with the supposed hack? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:57:29
2.5 minute blocks mine rate and 4x the coin cap of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:05:52
On a absolute dumbed down level is the lightning  network a blockchain ontop of a blockchain? Like a way to confirm transactions not on the actual bitcoin blockchain?
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:33:57
I did the exact same thing with shift card and have been in a great financial set up the past few months. I asked for a limit increase on daily spending for precaution and they granted it with very little rebuttal. I strongly believe in this technological revolution. If crypto fails it will be okay for me I'm young and can bounce back. Life is all about risk. In the last few months with crypto ive had huge financial freedom because of it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:57:18
Does Gemini have a debit card I can use off there exchange?
@_date: 2018-09-20 06:04:36
Accounts didn’t get hacked. 
Mt. Gox’s bitcoin got stolen.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:16:16
It is honestly. I'm pretty happy to see a stable day. A super good way I explained it to my friends Is like this : 
If you give money to a bank they invest your money and make the profit. The more people that use the bank the more money they can make , but with bitcoin the more people that have it the more powerful your money becomes.
@_date: 2018-08-30 08:12:58
Why is bcash actually dying. 
Seeing a strong influx of meme material but no info on why besides a look a like exit scam by bitmain 
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:52:18
Its the last straw because you made a mistake with the seed? it has never been 11 words ever. Dont blame a dev on your short comings. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 04:54:33
No fucking chance lmao
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:20:52
It’s not just the words lmao they are hidden amongst the foliage.
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:30:37
Had someone I know have several of there pneumonic words hidden in there tattoos split between 3 brothers. 
Thought that was crazy 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:23:14
Same I just one more information of why is this for the lightning network?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:43:13
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:19:46
Shill detected
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:54:30
So your bitcoin debit card can be swiped at any card reader and has exact and immediate conversion? 
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:34:25
Following cause I’m interested in where this is heading.
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:52:31
Probably not but sure. Have moved thousands through Coinbase since 2016 never had a problem. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:48:06
I’m lost. How hard is it for you to buy off of coinbase and send it to your wallet? How do you recommend getting any crypto? 
Coinbase is by far the easiest exchange I’ve ever dealt with.
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:00:51
Yes because my reddit account is directly linked to my Coinbase account which is also directly linked to all of my wallets directly with my social attached. You’re wild lol stop spreading horse shit. 
You mean moving my crypto thru multiple wallet addresses and through another exchange through a private crypto back to another exchange? If you aren’t gonna post shit to help people with input get lost lol.
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:39:19
Binance or Coinbase? You should never have anything on exchanges anyway. Only leave hot trading amounts on exchanges

All of you guys in bearish sentiment crack me up. It took only 3 weeks to hit 20k from where we are currently sitting. Btc needs maybe 3 big pushes. Institutional money, a sales giant accepting it as payment easier adoption maybe even a wide scale banking hack. 
Even if it doesn’t this year it will continue to climb. Personally I’d like a maybe 2-3k movement a year for the next 5-10 years then once a serious amount of adoption and usage happens along with some massive innovation to the btc block chain I believe these 60K 100k numbers are still to low. Digital scarcity is a incredible thing. Then being able to move incredible amounts anywhere on the planet in less than a hour is astounding tech.
