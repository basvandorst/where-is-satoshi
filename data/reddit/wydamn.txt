They have more value in bitcoin than in gold according to current exchange rates. The title implies the number of bitcoins they have is greater than the number of units of gold they have by some undefined metric.

Ready to not care? Yep. But please continue with the hype with no substance, it's humorous to see people who think it's still effective.

Spotted the American. Oh wait, this is Reddit, carry on.

I mean, dude probably got killed later on. The impact of the image is that he stood up to overwhelming might despite imminent death, and made the soldiers stop their tanks and say "wait, is this what we signed up for?"

As with anything in crypto-space, never take anything at face value, even from trusted sources.

Then it would make more sense to say the VALUE of their bitcoins is greater than the gold reserves.

I mean, I don't don't know about you, but I'd pay a premium for a bitcoin stripper.

Well, it's less than 2 weeks before the end of the month, and employers that pay in fiat tend to pay every two weeks, and OP is specifically asking about platforms that pay in bitcoin and not fiat. So kind of bad advice.

If you believe that, then my only advice is be cautious when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are cautious.

That's like me saying you only say cynical things because you want people to think you're thought-provoking. Your cynicism is also a selfish act.

Thanks for posting something like this while drunk, instead of the typical shitposts that look like a Facebook meme.

You can't buy A bitcoin, but you can buy bitcoin.

I'm a bitcoin maximalist, but I do believe alts serve a purpose, if that makes you feel any better.

To say it was DOA from the beginning is naive. It was a pump and dump, as pumpiest and dumpiest as they come. Say what you will about Roger Ver's current situation, he probably made some fucking fiat off of schmucks in the BCH heydays.

Eh, this is nothing new. I've heard some people switch over to credit unions after confirming which ones are bitcoin friendly, and having more success.

Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Bitcoin may be in a dip next week for all you know, and you'll feel silly for buying now and not being patient.
Generally it's better to just put aside a small amount from your wages with each paycheque. Treating bitcoin like a get-rich quick scheme is the wrong way to go about it, if you want to truly benefit you need to HODL for the long term.
