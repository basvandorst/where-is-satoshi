Because MAC is an acronym, and refers to something else entirely. Mac OS X has closed parts and open parts. You can download Darwin, compile it, and run open source all day You can do it on a full OS X install too. There is literally no difference, both Mac and Linux can run both closed and open source software. User error is user error.

By shittier, I meant that the fan control and other niceties might be compromised but perhaps this is not the case. Obviously Linux itself will run great.

Linux would be a waste on your Mac. It will run shittier and will not protect you from what happened anyway. Furthermore, your lack of familiarity with handling Linux will make you less secure in the end.
Stick with OSX (it's BSD anyway) and run from a non-admin account for your day-to-day. Don't install unknown software. You are now many times more secure than when you started.

Maybe run a virtualization scheme. Install Parallels or Fusion. Set up a Linux distro in that, put your wallet and shit in there, then only run it when you need to wallet stuff.

First, if you call them MACs, you are not half the computer guy you think you are. Second, a user running an untrusted binary as admin will compromise any OS. If you think Linux would have helped, see point 1.

What is your basis for this? My friend works in China and he just finished escorting a Chinese delegation around Southern Ontario... he took them to see the sights, Niagara falls and so on. They were anxious to get it over with; they all wanted to hit the outlet malls and buy up shitty designer label crap produced in -guess where?- China, where that stuff is more expensive than here. I agree it's counterintuitive but I wonder what evidence you have that counters my friend's anecdote and experience (he has lived in Beijing for years).
