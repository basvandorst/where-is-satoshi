Former occupier and bitcoin holder here, this tweet is stupid on a number of levels that I feel like not going into.
Bitcoin's real effect in these regards will be its unintended consequences, until then it will just be another financial tool that by and large is better manipulated by vulture capitalists than the general public (even if it is comparatively more accessible to the general public than the majority of financial schemes.)

It makes a difference because it points to the relationship of capitalism and the state, and what the sort of society decentralized transactions could ultimately create. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:34:19
The price of all investments are tied into what people expect the value of those investments will be in the future, that is the nature of all speculation. 
In the case of Bitcoin add that value to its use value aka the total volume of people who have bitcoin at any given moment because they want to buy something with it or they just sold something with it. 
The slower/more expensive transactions become, the more people could possibly speculate that Bitcoin will be less valuable in the future and jump ship (thereby deflating its price.)

Google, can you use it?
"Private property is a legal designation for the ownership of property by non-governmental legal entities."
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:38:54
Private ownership of the means of production can only happen with an intermediary that guarantees that property. Cavemen did not have deeds nor could they lay claim to profit accumulated from capital. Societies only began to do this with grain storage and that is at the heart of the birth of the state (but property didn't function as it did now until a few hundred years ago.) 
You should do more the research on the history of property than you have.

It is deflationary but it won't deflationary spiral because it is infinitely divisible.  
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:34:04
There is a fixed amount on Earth and the closer we reach it the more difficult it becomes to mine it so it is like Bitcoin.
The lesson to take away from this is when you have a deflationary value holder paired against an inflationary value holder, the former will hypothetically increase in value forever against it (so long as it is being used in the first place.) 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:41:20

Got it. So in this situation, you're the monkey who defends the scientist against the other monkeys "the lever-fruit system is fair and voluntarily you guys, leave them alone!"
Anyways I already went over the fact that price mechanisms aren't intrinsic to capitalism. 
But good job you googled "monkeys money". You know Wikipedia cites its references don't you? I gave you the same definition before presenting it to you, and also produced a centuries old political philosophy text on the matter but I guess I will paste wiki's citations for extra credit.

That is, private property is defined and exists only because of politics.

The state and capitalism are interdependent. Property law NECESSITATES a state. Bitcoin is just another mechanism of capitalism that will seed its own destruction in that it allows for non censorable transactions. The endgame of that formula is not some steam punk ancap bonanza, its an accidental albeit inevitable end to private property guaranteed by the monopoly of force of a state (without this you have no capitalism.) 
Having price mechanisms and the ability to perform transactions isn't a feature unique to capitalism, however, and in fact the more power that is spread out to ordinary people to do this, the more likely distribution IN GENERAL can follow, until it inevitably will. &lt;&lt; and that is at the essence of every anticapitalist vision.

Having a personal possession is not the same thing as having private property. The difference is its legal definition. 
Cavemen can have rocks in their personal possession because they find them on the ground. If someone comes and takes their rocks they can't go call the police to reclaim it. Even if they existed several millennia later  but pre-capitalist, chances are they weren't members of a very selective propertied class made up mostly of nobility who even had the basic rights that allowed them to own property with a state guarantor in the first place. 
Capitalism massively expanded that right extended by states because it was in the best interest of states to do so, so their citizenry can create wealth for them (many citizenries rebelled and took over their governments for the right to do so.) 
So no state, no property rights, no capitalism. But the means of the production and even maybe price mechanisms could stay.

Well ignoring the fact that 1) states selectively love black markets (virtually every drug market on Earth is facilitated through infrastructure created by war) and are the primary beneficiaries and/or benefactors to them, 2) even if crypto is used in a black market its done so in order for people to more privately facilitate the transfer of state backed fiat currency (which it is converted to at the beginning and end of the process), I will still say again that there has never been a stateless capitalist society nor any theory for it. Even anarcho capitalists, when pressed, admit they need a system for maintaining property through an independent arbiter that can use force (aka a state).
