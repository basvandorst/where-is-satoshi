Why shouldn't Bitcoin handle more transactions per second on-chain? Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and even Litecoin can do it, and it's a big competitive advantage.

Problems such as... what? Ethereum already handles more transactions than Bitcoin: 
To put things into context: the entire Bitcoin transaction history for the past 8 years takes 122GB (138GB with indexing data). The entire blockchain takes a small fraction of a $50 hard drive and can be downloaded in one day on cheap residential broadband (not to mention that most users don't even care to run a full node).
So there seems to be plenty of room for on-chain scaling. I have yet to hear a convincing argument that we must halt growth indefinitely until LN becomes mature enough.

After reading around, I cloned the lnd repo and tried to build it from source. I'm not at all convinced that this can become production ready anytime soon, and even when it does, it's unclear that LN can beat competing cryptocurrencies with higher on-chain transaction throughput in terms of usability.
Betting the future of the Bitcoin industry on an emerging technology with a number of open research questions seems unwise.

I've been running a full Bitcoin node on a 4-years old laptop without issues. I could easily handle a larger block size without even upgrading the hard drive.
The argument that the blockchain would become too large is pure FUD.

NO, NO, NO. Overwriting files in /usr with manually downloaded binaries is asking for trouble. Those files were installed by deb packages and are being tracked as such. The Ubuntu update system (called apt) will upgrade the bitcoin package when it becomes available.
Your system should have security updates already enabled: [
If bitcoin 0.16.1 wasn't marked as a security update, you can get it along with other regular updates by doing:
`apt update`  
`apt dist-upgrade`
It's a good idea to run the above commands frequently on your servers, or configure unattended-updates to do it periodically.
It's also possible that your bitcoin package came from a 3rd party apt repository (possibly a PPA). In which case, go figure if the packager already published the updated binary You should know how you installed your system :-)
In case nobody packaged bitcoin 0.16.1 for your distro (highly unlikely, if it's the latest version of Ubuntu) as a last resort you could install generic binaries for Linux directly from a tarball. But never put those in /usr! Insteasm unpack the tarball in your home (\~/bitcoin) and run the binary from there, or maybe move it to /usr/local/bin and update your scripts to launch it from there. You can optionally uninstall the system bitcoin package to avoid confusion.
As a final note, it is generally a bad idea to run security-sensitive software such as Bitcoin on AWS, especially if you're not familiar with basic Linux sysadmin topics such as updating packages. Your machine will be owned in no time as soon as you forget to patch a serious vulnerability.
You can use this node to relay blocks (nice thing to do), but assume it's already compromised and don't use the wallet on that machine to receive any balance other than pennies for testing.

Suppose Segwit was activated today: which wallet software would let me create Segwit transactions? Is the UI already built into Bitcoin Core, but hidden until activation?
Follow-up question: Does any existing wallet software already support side-chains? If not, what would a reasonable UI for it look like?
I'm trying to understand what the user experience will look like in a segwit world, and how long it would realistically take for it to increase Bitcoin's transaction throughput without further growing blocks on the main chain.

Exchanges are no longer subsidizing transaction fees for Bitcoin withdrawals. Moreover, some exchanges started settling peer-to-peer to reduce their transaction costs.
Wouldn't this suffice to explain the lower number of on-chain transactions?

I installed the Electrum-LTC 2.8.3.2 beta, started it with --testnet --segwit, and transferred in some coins from a faucet.
There's no GUI for SegWit transactions yet, so I went to the debug console. There's a createmultisig() command equivalent to the one in bitcoin-qt, but I couldn't find anything equivalent to addwitnessaddress, which is needed to create the second signer for createmultisig.
If you managed to generate a SegWit transaction with Electrum, I'd be grateful if you could publish step-by-step documentation.
EDIT: The version of Electrum-LTC I'm using is 2.8.3.2, not 2.8.3.

You mean [this]( The page doesn't say what "ready" actually means. Can any of these "ready" wallets actually create P2SH-P2WPKH addresses and use them to send and receive payments?
Even the Bitcoin Core codebase doesn't seem to have anything implemented besides some tests and the "addwitnessaddress" rpc command. I might have missed something, but I don't see how I could create a LN transaction from the command line with this. Can you provide a link to some instructions?
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:16:55
But can users actually create segwit transactions today?
I don't think we should imply that segwit has been tested in Litecoin until a wallet with segwit support becomes available and a good number of segwit transactions in the blockchain.
I honestly want to see proper sidechain support in Bitcoin, but claiming that segwit activation would immediately eliminate high transaction fees is deceptive. It will take months at best (that is, IF software becomes available and IF it works as well as claimed).
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:55:12
In this case, I will support Segwit in a few weeks.

The [Amikopay repo]( has not seen any commits since June 2016.
Is there a public git repository where I can find a near-complete implementation of SegWit / Lightning Network to test?

See [my reply to phor2zero](
Just show me how to create a segwit transaction on the Litecoin chain (or on a testnet) using any of these SegWit-ready wallets and I will be convinced. Thank you.

There are currently no wallets that can create SegWit transactions, let alone use side-chains. SegWit activated on Litecoin almost one month ago, and there are just two hand-made SegWit transactions on the Litecoin chain with 0 LTC output.
Is anyone working on actually implementing SegWit for end-users? And if so, what's the expected delivery date? Where can I take a look at the work-in-progress code?

Just made a donation. Thanks to IAFCU for their work to improve the banking system.

Take your check to the [Internet Archive Federal Credit Union]( the only US bank which [openly supports Bitcoin](
