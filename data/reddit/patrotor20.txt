Agree that zenledger is a really good crypto tax software

BTC receiving address then?....

Yeah. The form asks for the physical address of where you hold the foreign account.

Yeah, just feels like we are very close but very far away from mass adoption

I'm pretty sure if you don't owe the gov't money then they don't much care. But I'm also curious if 2017 gains that went unreported will be a target. 
But from the IRS perspective, audits are expensive too (time, risk of losing) so they are probably picky.

What percentage of potholes do you think are fixed by anarchists vs fixed by local gov't employees?
Like I said, I'm not paying any taxes on my crypto investments in 2018 because I tax loss harvested. 
There was corruption, waste, and wars before there were taxes because people are angry and scared. Human nature is good and bad. So is gov't. Governing is terrible and messy because people are at the individual level and up. Family, Tribe, City-State, Nation, Globally. We are a mess. 
So, enjoy the infrastructure and hope we can do some good with it. Try to make things better. Just screaming into the void on the internet doesn't do much.

I decided to tax loss harvest.   
Good luck with the whole taxation is theft thing. I like roads and hospitals. If you don't pay taxes, it usually doesn't work out well for you in the end.   
The gov't is shutdown so I'm glad I'm not on the IRS payroll :)

Yeah, I did some tax loss harvesting. Crypto certainly won't be a revenue generating asset class for the IRS for 2018.

Nice. I'm sure a lot of people this year have tax losses but have held all the way down.
