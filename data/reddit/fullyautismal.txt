Isn't the device itself pretty expensive though?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:52:24
Is this what day trading is like? BUY BUY BUY SELL SELL SELL!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:30:48
Not using GDAX then huh?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:23:20
ITS TANKING HARD
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:52:57
Why do so many people trade down to the penny? Why not just increments of like 25 to 50 cents?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:22:22
Nope get in now before it cracks $15,000
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:15
AKA Buy as much bitcoin as you can right now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:39:36
I mean what's double bottom?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:45:16
Bitcoin already shooting up again. &lt;$16000 was a great time to jump in.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:18
To the moon
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:08:00
Wish I could sell right now. Bitcoin at a HUGE discount. Managed to buy some at 16,675 tho
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:08:26
Yes please, poop your bitcoin right into my mouth daddy.

Nah, it's been teetering in the 13,000's for awhile.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:05:05
Greedy? Pretty sure a majority of crypto-investors are trying to make some money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:03:53
Can I go to bed right now or do I need to stay up so I can buy at bottom? or will it keep decreasing tomorrow morning?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:00:17
It won't get any cheaper. Probably for awhile.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:28:40
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:01:36
Don't worry about small drops (~$50-100). Just people trying to short their holdings. Price is on the upswing hard right now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:59:48
Very cluttered, too much going on at once.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:10:45
Can you explain why?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:43
What's wrong with that? They both follow the same trend and most of the Litecoin community says it's severely undervalued compared to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:54:46
Woah man calm down with your reckless investing. /s
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:38:35
Don't have any coins right now, sold all back before the hard crash. Waiting that big booty bottom price.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:32:16
Nice shenanigans
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:40:49
Lol some people are asleep and don't even know what's happening right now. Guess that's what makes bitcoin scary is something like this happening in the blink of an eye.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:09:44
$14,000-$14,200 is BUY territory. DO NOT PANIC SELL!
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:26:18
They broke through briefly this morning could do it again today now that there's even more volume. If it dips below 12.5 again I think we'll see an even larger sell off.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:51:14
Took me a week. I'd say on the 23rd or 24th.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:12:04
A giant unflushable turd will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:33:08
Just one last dip for the people that missed out earlier.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:55:09
BTC is still dropping, sell it then rebuy at a low price before it's too late.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:47:38
Stainless steel would be good
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:31:53
They're keeping it high so that their insider trades get tied to all the $8500 buy orders and leave everyone else in the dust as it crashes and burns into the ground.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:28:23
Lol WTF just happened?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:25:17
Lol. Rekt.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:58:37
Cause people keep shitting in an unflushable toilet all at the same time. They gotta unclog that bitch before they let people unload.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:14:35
This ain't a crash, this is a cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:15:05
It's either gonna crash back down at 13,600 or break thru the ceiling.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:17:57
IT BROKE THROUGH!
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:44:28
What's your indicator to smash that buy button?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:29:54
Looks like 13,850 is the breaking point
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:54:35
Depends on if they can flush the diarrhea toilet that is bitcoin cash order processing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:39:31

No problem I bought some steel mesh gloves with my bitcoin money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:20:56
Any idea how long it takes for Gemini to verify identity?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:55:04
Based on what?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:03:09
What does that mean?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:19:06
Goodbye $13,000's it was nice knowing you for 25 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:07:14
He offered to turn your $1,000 into ~$13,000 in just a few days? Sorry man but you're really dumb for giving him the money in the first place. Also we're not going to witch hunt him for you, what do you want us to do? Call the police if you're serious about trying to get your money back.

@_date: 2017-12-20 01:55:37
It's gonna crash hard.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:24:21
$13,900 is the next ceiling we need to break.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:51:19
But the question is...when will it bottom out?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:55:13
Dude trying to profit off the term "Bitcoin" to unsuspecting people when it actually isn't bitcoin rather another altcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:12:11
There's a big buy wall around $12,150. I expect that to be the bottom.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:58
Coinbase making sure all their insider sell orders are tied to all the buy orders at $8500 before they release. FISHY
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:20:42
Check back in 5 minutes ha
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:17:37
It just hit a double ceiling at $13,600. Expect a drop down to the $12,900 range over the next half hour.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:32:01
Seems to be struggling around $13,500
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:56:08

It's like a rubber band extending further and further down ready to spring.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:33:58
I guess the time to worry about a sell off is if BTC price flatlines for 15 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:08:18
So jealous. I was asleep at 6am here. :(

The problem is you can't buy a house, you can't pay your bills, you can't buy a car, you can't buy a lot of things with pure BTC...yet. All BTC is good for is having cash value, and until a majority of businesses and companies start accepting BTC as a liquid asset it will remain to be a tool for people to invest in and hopefully cash out money with. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:50:05
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:41:00
So when will the sell orders go through for BCH? Do they just flip a switch real fast then stop everything?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:35:26
Looks like they're trying to cancel all the orders for BCH right now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:54:18
Gemini &gt; GDAX &gt; Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:47
You won't be able to. GDAX price is gonna crash like a brick down to maybe even the $2000's people are just trying to sell off the "Free cash" they just got. Only a few people will be able to sell at $8500 once they release the hold.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:40:13
Sell walls getting crushed left right and center. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:54:26

HODL (Your cash) buy on the upswing
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:13:06
Guess I'll transfer a small amount and see how long it takes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:29:00
The more coinbase delays the more of a shitstorm it's going to be. Very unprofessional on their behalf.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:58:50
Continued downtrend? It's only been going up for about 4 hours now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:55:34
Bitfinex trading @ $12,300 while GDAX @ $13,300 what gives?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:00:42
Another hour and it'll be there
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:15:12
TL;DR - Non-believer let his wife convince him to sell his coins so she can go shopping with his money.

Very well could be. I can't wait til we get there.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:03:11
Bunch of people selling their holdings at $15,000 price point. In order to kill that wall we need as many people as we can to purchase at that price point essentially "Killing" the wall. Once that wall is down people panic buy and the price increases rapidly.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:26
Be prepared for a huge upward swing on BTC price once the BCH sell off begins. Thousands of coins will be bought in a short period of time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:49:33
Sounds like someone that didn't buy in the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:54:28
As long as we're going up more than we're going down we're doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:50:00
Bitcoin heavily overpriced on GDAX right now, by about $1000.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:11:11
Coinbase doing it's best job at artificially lowering the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:10:20
Doesn't it take awhile to transfer money though?
