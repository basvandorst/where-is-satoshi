Sorry for talking about a place of which I know nothing about... Surely you know more of it than I do. That being said, I am from South America, and now I live in New Zealand, and I think that, comparatively, Japan is at least a bit more technologically focused.

HSTS is great after you've visited the website once. It does not protect you on your first visit.
The only way to do so is to type ' manually, or use the HTTPS everywhere browser addon by the EFF.

I agree with him. If you are going to have a small amount of BTCs (less than a couple hundred's worth), then using electrum is OK.
I personally have an encrypted electrum wallet in an offline hard drive, and the 12 word seed written down somewhere safe. I also have a blockchain.info account with pocket change which I use as spending money.

Or to rephrase, wouldn't rotating the addresses involve complexity on Apache's behalf and serve *no purpose whatsoever*?
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:11:27
Yeap, was going to say. If you have state-level adversaries, most of them have a CA which is included in the trusted CAs of TOR browser.
@_date: 2014-09-17 23:41:54
Also, when circle opens up to the general public, they will start having way more fraud which they are not having now. 
Perhaps they will have to implement Coinbase's security measures.

@_date: 2014-12-07 02:37:27
It is very unlikely that the Russian government would be able to block a portion of the github website without running an active MitM attack on github due to the security measures github has put in place.
China has had to resort to this in the past, e.g.

@_date: 2014-12-15 03:38:47
I absolutely do not recommend them. I can also elaborate on why I don't recommend them:
- Slow payouts. Takes nearly a month for you to get the smallest of payments. Given that they use Bitcoin for payouts, there is no excuse.
- They demand "professionalism". I was told that my avatar wasn't good enough for their standards. WTF?
- They always side with the client. E.g. I found a Stored XSS vuln. This is always a high with CVSS, so I submitted it as a high. The vendor said some bullshit about how it was a low because you can only attack the client, and I got a low reward, *WITH NO APPEAL PROCESS*. I got - literally - 0.025 BTC for Stored Cross Site Scripting. Incredible.
Just use other bug bounties. (e.g hackerone)

Well yea, it's a pretty fucked up law, created wayyyyyy to long ago and not adapted to how computers work today.


This is what he is charged for, for scraping a website he had access to and making what he scraped publicly available. If you add to that that the information he made public should have been public by default, the whole issue is beyond retarded, and beyond unfair.
He was a great dude, and his death was a tragedy and a great blow to humanity. You cannot blame gov entirely for that, though.

I'm not saying putting money into bitcoin is a bad idea.
Giving financial advice to people comes with real consequences to them, and you - given your experience with bitcoin - should know that not all people can withstand the highs and lows of this insane roller-coaster.
@_date: 2014-10-23 21:24:54
To be fair, that's what the title says.
@_date: 2014-10-13 02:31:32
What law in particular did he break? 
In my opinion he broke no law, and he was innocent, and I am moderately familiar with the case. Scraping websites you have been authorized to access and downloading it's contents may be a breach of the terms of conditions, but under no conditions it should be a crime.
(Apologies if I misuse the term "crime", IANAL and I don't live in the US)

Be careful, there is a reason why Coinbase takes some time before approving your requests, and Circle is taking a risk.
Is it a measured risk which they can manage? Time will tell.

I agree with you, some parts of using Bitcoin are easy; for example, sending money and receiving it.
Some parts, however, are extremely complex and smart, computer savvy people struggle with them. An example of this would be keeping your bitcoins secure, cold storage and balancing security and ease of use.
I think it is hard because it is hard to create a secure computing environment.
@_date: 2014-12-08 08:11:39
This would have security ramifications.

@_date: 2014-10-10 01:35:24
You don't, that's why you leave the trading to people who know about it, and only buy bitcoin because you believe in the long-term promise or because you want to spend them.
Me, personally, I would not sell if the price dropped to $100. (I believe it will not drop to a hundred, though)
