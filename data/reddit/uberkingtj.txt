You'd think a potential 2000% increase in 1-2 years would be worth* the long hold, especially with tax incentive. Even if it drops down sub 7k, so what. Wait.

How much money are they willing to lose, and what type of gains are they hoping for?

My understanding is a bit limited on this, but I believe what happens is a request is sent from your wallet to the ledger. This request is recorded and tracked by the ledger. 
So when you make a request for say $100 worth of bitcoin to your offline wallet, a request is sent for that amount, and when successful, a response is sent (also recorded and tracked by the ledger) to your wallet. Once your wallet is reconnected and updates with the current ledger, you will see a pending/completed transaction in your wallet.

Wouldn't that be the [16th Amendment](

Yesterday to today, Bitcoin went up from ~$9000 to $9100, about 1.1%. Meaning in order to have made $300-$500 during this time, you would have needed $27,273 (~3.03 bitcoins) - $45,454 (~5.05 bitcoins).

Tax incentives

In the U.S, and using the link below as my reference, if you hold your assets for a year, you get better tax incentives in terms of what bracket you're in. Say you bought your assets at $10,000 and it increased to $50,000 by the same time next year, you'll ~~be taxed~~ only pay taxes on $11,400 ($50,000 - $38600), meaning ~$1170.
Versus normal tax rates where you'd pay ~$6912: $925 (10% bracket) + $3501 (12% bracket) + $2486 (22% bracket), in addition to the marginal taxes paid per transaction.

I'd mark it as part of my deductions.

Emphasis on **time**.

Don't harp on semantics. Does manipulation matter in the long run with respect to recent pricing if today's price is far less than it could be 5 years from now? Manipulation is unavoidable in any market.
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:10:57
And I don't plan to. There are a plethora of sources that can answer why and how questions. If you have time to post questions you have time to do your own research. Either buy and hold, buy and sell, wait and buy, or don't. I recommend the first. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 23:30:27


Evidenced where?


Sounds logical.
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:00:05


If you find the history of Bitcoin's price currently useless and would rather wait to buy until when you say then wait.
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:32:21


I'm not reading past the first line. Either buy and hold, or buy and spend.

Wow, I'd appreciate some silver at least. Keep HODL morale high!

What I really don't understand is why people are complaining to selling their bitcoins when so many companies are buying them. It's clearly being manipulated. Just hold for a year or two and chill out.

Just a thought, April 17th was the last day for taxes, meaning May 8th should be the 21st day for returns. We should see some heavy action around then right?

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this should help:

So will we eventually have telecommunication and internet service through the use of the Lightning Network someday?
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:47:52
That makes more sense with respect to the internet service. Thanks for the quick reply.
