BITGO SUPPORT EMAIL 
""Hey V,
The root cause was that the whoever paid you from address: (1Em66umynYhE1NeLwG14ax3E1mFYeEvhiX) has also spent the same Bitcoin elsewhere. Please see the following link to see that it is a conflicting transaction.
This means that at the same time they used the bitcoin to pay you, they also paid someone else. The one that went to the other person was confirmed by the Bitcoin network first was confirmed first and was not actually paid to your account.
We are investigating how to move forward with this internally to ensure that your account remains in a healthy state.
