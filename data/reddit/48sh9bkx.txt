Dear Cardholder,
 
Yesterday, January 4th 2018, the Xapo Card issuer Wave Crest Holdings, Ltd. was instructed by Visa® to close all cards of its Visa® programs effective immediately.
 
Unfortunately, Xapo did not receive any anticipated notice to prepare for - and have our cardholders prepare for - the cancellation of our Card program.
 
How does this change affect you?
 
Your Xapo Card has been deactivated, and you will not be able to use it for further payments or withdrawals. The rest of your Xapo account remains active, and you can continue to access your Xapo wallet balance and funds without interruptions. All other Xapo services are available for your use, as always.
 
If you currently have any pending transactions or refunds on your Xapo Card, we will work with WaveCrest to settle your pending transactions during the next few weeks.
 
What's next?
 
If you ordered the Xapo Card recently, you expected to have much more time to use it. This is why Xapo will offer you the option to claim a refund of your card order fee through your Xapo Account if you ordered your card on or after December 1st, 2017. If you qualify, we will email you soon with instructions.
 
As a token of our appreciation for being a loyal Xapo customer, once we are able to service Xapo Cards in your country again, we will offer you a new card free of charge.
 
We are hard at work to find alternative card solutions for you. The past years have shown what a powerful product a cryptocurrency payment card can be, and we are already in discussions with potential card issuers allowing Xapo to continue serving customers in Europe and beyond.
 
We are deeply sorry that we cannot continue to provide Xapo Cards until further notice - we are doing our best to find new and improved alternatives, and we hope to be back in your country soon.
 
If you have any questions or issues in the meantime, please reach out to our team.
 
The Xapo Card Team

No I'm Satoshi!
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:41:09
Is that an bitcoin ATM?
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:23:58
Maybe not pour, but you can still shove a paper wallet down people's throats! I'm sure hardware wallets would also work.

Love the page! Can you please update the edit holdings popup? Its really awfull and hard to see what you are about to edit there. A bigger page, there is no reason to make it so small.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:21:08
also warning do not be stupid
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:18:24
Hell yeah! Still a bit to go

Have you seen my crystal ball? I seem to have misplaced it. I'm sure it would give me a good answer for that.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:21:12
Good for you congratulations! Did you manage to time the 19.5k top?
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:07:46
Well maybe follow that simple rule. I don't know how you thought making multiple accounts on the same exchange was a good idea
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:57:13
We saw these levels just last week when we blazed past them.
@_date: 2018-09-17 06:13:25

SWEET! Best christmas present ever
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:13:48
Really? I found it to be bad. Does not answer or explain anything in it. Unless you never heard of bitcoin you might as well save those 10mins you will never get back of your life.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:48:10
No lambo?
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:22:47
That's great! But how did it go? Did it help his business?
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:26:30
next year that will be the most expensive thing you have ever bought
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:55:59
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:40:41
You forgot the most important one, Not your keys, not your bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:31:35
Shitload of people overpaying for the next block atm
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:41:20
HODL! Wonder how it will look next year
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:10:52
+1 But people should really know better than to click on the ads
@_date: 2018-08-27 17:32:35
Any more info of what that misrepresentation actually is? Seems to be awfully vague worded.
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:19:40
Yes it has been looking very stable last month!
@_date: 2018-08-07 19:15:40
thought the moon was always straight ahead
@_date: 2018-08-17 19:29:08
An whole bitcoin! Wish I had one of those!
@_date: 2018-08-09 06:18:40
why don't you post that from your real account?
@_date: 2014-08-01 17:50:54
rofl but its hilarious i really laughed while reading the comments
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:35:00
To the moon! Don't we all regret not buying 
@_date: 2014-08-08 01:28:11
Someone just copy paste it here so we all can read it.
@_date: 2014-08-02 17:52:25
Does anyone know of an good video review of it? I can only find some promotion videos. No review by an independent party.
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:30:49
It's just Kim Jong-un getting into crypto
@_date: 2018-10-04 19:23:58
I would also put my 1.2k btc on binance
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:19:12
Think all btc went to buying lambos
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:50:10
Why not? Just as altcoin miners mine several coins depending on what one is most profitable, so will sha256 miner do. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:03:15
Why are you so eager to include it in the next block? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:33:19
Well here in Sweden I tried out a service and the fee was 10 fucking percent, and no mention of the fee anywhere on page.
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:53:45
The dollar is devaluating
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:35:52
Oh no 100$!
WE ARE CRASHING!
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:39:00
Yes you are! People are happy, what is wrong with that?
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:33:54
dat formatting
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:40:20
I think they are pretty funny. Shows that people are happy about going to the moon.
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:40:00
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:28:01
C'mon 4k you can do it!
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:36:20
We need another split so we can break 4k.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:24:56
That is nothing just wait it out
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:54:00
they are professionals don't try this at home kids
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:34:20
could we please stop talking about the other sub, just ignore  em, we would follow that sub if we were interested.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:36:00
we are all out of memes
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:33:50
You are lucky, this is the lambo I can afford
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:05:06
Hey man heard of ublock?
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:11:35
No most people will sell off early. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:31:00
You forgot the upcoming bch fork,
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:27:42
I'm getting an space shuttle that can take me to the moon when ever i like
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:16:01
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:38:44
We will have an whole generation of millionaires
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:57:43
meh he should be driving a lambo, remake the cartoon
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:07:10
I'm telling everyone, trying to get em on so they can make their own profits.
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:04:21
what an odd comparison, but is it really?
@_date: 2015-07-19 20:16:58
Maybe you should host the file elsewhere, it seems to be down. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:43:55
I totally agree, why to people make such a thing of it? It has been mentioned countless of times in different series already. Don't feel it will drive the price any way
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:22:04
I would rather wait for a big one
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:30:00
its not about the top speed you can hardly max it out in day to day usage
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:30:19
who cares about an random series
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:45:59
thanx man, taking one for the team so the others can buy in!
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:38:17
It's ok they will buy in when they seeing the uptrend continues
@_date: 2018-11-02 13:30:26
he could only afford the dash from october's profits
@_date: 2016-09-30 17:27:53
It just meant you are not too bright
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:00:10
Why on earth would you sell at 6k? If it goes to 0 so be it, id rather have my worthless btc than the life long regret of selling then
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:17:46
wall of text warning, use some sentence spacing
@_date: 2017-09-25 05:18:47
If you are trying to buy the dip and have not yet set up an account for it you are too late to the party. I have been using bitstamp. they did requre scan om my card and an bill but no selfies or chapcha. inserting money take 3days banktransfer and withdrawing the same amount of time.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:46:09
you are not required to sub
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:11:08
It's a long way to 0
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:22:34
I would gladly donate my processing power while i visit the site
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:58:19
WHAT AN ACCOMPLISMENT!
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:17:35
actually they are not that bad
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:21:43
Not really, it will bounce back as soon as the Chinese stop selling
@_date: 2016-09-30 15:33:16
Are you gonna pay for a hit?
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:01:18
there it is! to the moon!
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:54:20
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:51:41
What movie is that?
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:24:07
thank you fbi and nsa for taking care of my torrent needs
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:54:04
Still quite impressive they could raise that money.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:42:50
Did you sync with the pie or copy the blockchain to the external drive?
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:31:01
Holy shit those were some expensive drugs. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:20:55
They should know better by now
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:15:38
I could eat that!
@_date: 2017-09-12 06:29:57
No it is not, you can not download the binaries anywhere.
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:31:11
meh just hold, you do not loose anything unless you sell for lower. in will go over 5k, if not not then later
@_date: 2018-02-07 05:43:05
Consumers should not be so gullible
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:42:13
You forgot
* Create wallet for them and keep the private key
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:35:27
you could also use an adblocker, or bookmarks
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:44:49
Upvote! Tho i'm sure he would get more if he were naked!
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:27:23
For those who are not fluent in that language, what does it say?
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:12:11
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:44:23
they stole our symbol!
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:40:29
wut? that has been here for years
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:58:27
It would be interesting to know how many $ has funded terrorism.
@_date: 2015-03-08 00:21:34
They were a good idea. Ppl getting their hand on the first versions made big $$. Last versions were not up to par tho
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:25:45
BUY! But wait for it to drop some more first
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:20:34
Yes, there it shows ADDRESS(XXXX BTC), but when I enter an amount it says i Use total available minus fee: XXX. So I can not transfer all my btc.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:12:55
it is not that obvious since a lot of people are panic selling and trying to cash out
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:41:07
Still its' horribly low. Not even 5k have signed.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:12:01
you should not read the other sub and regurgitate the information here, if we are interested we will read it
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:59:01
@_date: 2017-07-04 10:46:45
Would it not be possible to just import the coins to a wallet that is on the prefered chain even after the split?
@_date: 2017-07-08 18:28:01
Temporary out of service eh? :(
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:10:48
dat quality
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:46:03
there is no such thing, i just regret not buying more
