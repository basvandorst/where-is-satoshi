I think it may have been difficult to take bitcoin seriously at its start as well, when it was worth very little. In the analogy, would an alt coin not be simply a smaller deal, with different / lower quality product? In this case, the users would be doing the same thing (part taking in crypto currency) and it would promote the thing as a whole (imo).

I posted it here because I want the specific oppions of those who invest in bitcoin. I just dont understand why people hate/downvote anything that isnt bitcoin. Do you know of a better place to post this?

Why is there such a large difference between price on markets? If the price on MtGox is $10 higher, why ever buy it there?

Yeah, its a great time to buy. Hopefully I can get verified tonight, and deposit tomorrow.

I just figured I might get an answer faster here, I have already emailed them.

Thanks for the reply.

What do you mean trade? Can I deposit but not buy the coins until I'm verified?

I agree that theyre a lot of clones, but it seems people hate altcoins in general, regardless if they are unique or not.

Great point about discrediting the idea of a finite coin amount. I hadn't thought of that before, thanks.
