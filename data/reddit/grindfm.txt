It's a big question. There are several quirks you can't to avoid.
1. If your package is small there is almost no way to pay less than Minimum Billable Weight. If your shipping volume less than Zappos or HP you can do nothing about it. For example if your package weight is less than 13 OZ the only option is USPS First-Class. FedEx and UPS will charge 1 lbs.
2. All that residential fees. FedEx and UPS charge $2.80-$3.2 per package and USPS doesn't charge residential fees. Also don't forget about the extended (rural) areas surcharges. As I already wrote if you are not Zappos size you couldn't exclude such fees from your agreement.
Is speak about Smailex we are not so huge.

1. Rates are defined as lbs per zone. Zone is a radius in miles. 1lb is a minimum for package. 
Example (numbers are random): package cost $10 and it includes $2.80 residential surcharge. Important remark: carrier discount covers only base prise + fuel surcharge. It means that insured value, residential fees and all other surcharges are excluded from discount. So $7.20 is base rate + fuel. Let's assume that you have 25% off on the Ground service. It means that in theory that base + fuel - discount should be equal $5.4 But for the specific zone 1lb costs $6.2 And they use minimum billable weight + residential surcharge. $6.2+$2.8 (residential)=$9 and not $7.5 as could be expected at the beginning. 
It's really big theme how carriers negotiate agreements and how they pricing. There is a bunch of companies that simply audit carrier invoices and help you to negotiate the agreements. If you have strong shipping patterns and volumes you could eliminate some fees and discuss every point. Carriers are always trying to maximize their profits. And often change the rules.
2. We are planing to do it in the next couple of months.

There are two pickup types: scheduled and on-call pickups. 
Scheduled pickups usually used by companies and have fixed price per week. 
On-call pickups are charged differently. FedEx charges $3 per box and UPS charges $5-$9 per box (exact amount depends on your location).

If your package is less than 4 lbs and 12 inches per dimension USPS is always cheaper. FedEx and UPS win when you have big and heavy packages.
