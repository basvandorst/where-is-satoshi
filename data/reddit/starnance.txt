Acting like a dickhead is what drives people to scam and shit coins

I'm simply stating that your opinions are incorrect (from my POV) and so one sided that you haven't thought critically about the other side of the implementation of Bitcoin as tech.
But of course I'm biased as I HODL BTC

Mate you're a wanker , I hold a 0 position in BCH - just wondering why the double digit price increase and if anyone had any thoughts ?

@_date: 2018-04-23 07:24:31
Admit you're too quick to call admins ! My post even said BCH and scam in the same sentence
@_date: 2018-04-21 01:39:37
Certainly makes a good case for Bitcoin

Your bias in one direction is completely obvious given that your view points are entirely subjective
