It will be interesting from a legal perspective. If the claims are denominated in fiat, it's possible that claims will end up all being paid off with MtGox being left in profit which will surely being claimed by the shareholders, on the other hand there will be many customers who feel that since they were holding BTC their payout should be paid in terms of the price of their bitcoins.

Why don't you ask the spokesman who appears in all of their videos?

Not if you use those words to create a story.

I'm actually astonished at how much it didn't crash, 3 years ago you'd been looking at a 66% drop. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:53:12
Sheeeiiiiiiiiiiii HAHAHAHA
@_date: 2017-02-13 19:48:45
Sounds like a good deal from the perspective of the hedge fund.
@_date: 2017-02-13 19:56:51
More than 15%.

I've been extremely hesitant to ever partake in the absurd circlejerk that is this sub, but even I think there's a decent chance the price could hit $3,000 in the next ten years. Now bear in mind that the hedge fund managers will probably offer a lower price to account for the uncertainty plus an additional discount to represent profit for the hedge fund/which represents the value of getting their money now to the claimees. Now consider that due to low interest rates in the West, having to wait a few years for the GoxCoins to sufficiently appreciate in value won't be as bad as if government bonds were paying out 8pc anually.

Glad to see this sub is still just as delusional as it always was. I'm sure these multi-millionaires took out the domain name before going too public with the proposal so nobody could hold them to ransom.
Don't get me wrong, if ETF gets the red flag and the price of BTC crashes like a motherfucker I'm wiring a few grand over to a certain German bank to increase my holdings rather than crying like a bitch.

I was there when it dropped from around £180 to around £72 back in the old days of ~~empty box~~ MtGox, yeah for an equity a 10% crash in a day is bad, but by Bitcoin standards this is actually nothing.
@_date: 2017-02-13 20:55:28
I'm sure both of these uncertainties have been factored into the price offered which is in fact why the price offered is not 25% (roughly the number of Bitcoins accounted for.)
@_date: 2017-02-13 19:16:44
My understanding was that if BTC becomes worth around $2-3000 everyone will be paid off.
@_date: 2017-02-14 17:48:39
I love this.

I'm surprised at how well BTC is holding its value tbh, things were getting a little silly and I expected some sort of correction, but it's held up pretty damn well.
@_date: 2017-02-14 17:35:53
Apart from the fact it crashed by about 10% in one day.
@_date: 2017-02-13 20:13:05
If you could buy an investment for $15 now which will pay you $22 within the next 3 years, pretty much every hedge fund manager in the world would tell you to buy it. I'm a massive bear and I think most people into Bitcoin, Winklevoss Bros. included are fucking idiots, but I believe MtGox claimants have a decent chance at getting say 50% of what they're owed.

The Chinese government probably could make life for bitcoiners difficult enough to prevent any sort of widespread adoption so yeah it probably is good news from a bull perspective...

The only exchange rate which ever mattered.

I bought this shit when it was going for £40-60.
Ninja, if this goes to zero I'll still be happy I was a part of it.
