Lol at these people saying Eth is going to crash. Just mad cause they're the BTC bag holders.

Invest in NEO, XLM, WTC, NAS, NEBL, ICX, SUB.
Really any of those should be good long term "year or two".

Funny joke.

Why woudn't you sell at 20k? LOL. That is some serious fail, if you didnt sell your bitcoin at 20k.

Sell your coins at a small profit guys, dont get greedy and become bag holders.

Well Bitcoin's at $7,931  
Are you happy you panicked and sold?

Nailed it 100%, so much easier to make back the money if you have a big amount to start out with.

It's back to where it was a week ago, who cares. You guys panicked and sold. Lol.

If everyone with money was all "Meh" everytime they lost it, they wouldn't have money to invest and they would be poor.

Well if you bought it below 15k or 10k, pretty ridiculous to not take your profit, especially in a market as risky as crypto. I made the same mistake with other coins, didn't sell at the high, got too greedy and it crashed. Not trying to give anyone shit sorry.

People forget, the guy with millions of dollars in the bank is still hit hard when he loses 10k, 20k, 50k etc. How do you guys think most people get to a point where they are millionaires, by making smart decisions with their money.  20k can still do a lot for a millionaire. It's not just chump change  to lose lol.

Just hold until it goes back up. Or research Stop losses/Stop Limits, which can save you a lot of money and headache during a crash or dip.

For real! Im so glad Coinbase has a limit on Debit cards.
