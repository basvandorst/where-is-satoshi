I hope everyone gets their money out first. Then Gox can die in peace. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 10:05:31
I still have the blockchain app
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:19:03
He didn't hurt anyone, but he was knowingly let a person do illegal things. That's a crime. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:14:03
Actually, it is. But still, charlie is innocent until proven guilty. Let's see what the department of justice has against him. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:51:38
They are stalling ... Again. It's just a matter of time before they go under. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:20:07
Haha! Have an upvote
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:28:13
You need to do this more often. Communication is important! We can handle bad news, we can handle the fact that Gox has problems! But what we can't handle, is that you keep us in the dark with almost everything! 
@_date: 2014-02-19 11:11:13
Or, use Kraken
@_date: 2014-02-02 13:12:43
Exactly. I wonder wen they'll be online
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:11:28
I think he made this decision himself. It basically was the only logic decision. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:21:39
This needs an upvote
@_date: 2014-01-26 18:13:32
Mt.Gox should quit. They make bitcoin look bad. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:19:41
And last time i checked, you don't have to hurt anyone to commit a crime. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 14:56:15
Both. Saw the edit, thanks for fixing this :) 
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:00:41
It's not about ditching. You don't want someone involved who is being investigated. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:43:31
Money that was used for "criminal" purposes. The reason i use ", is because i don't consider drugs criminal. 😬
@_date: 2014-02-19 14:04:41
It won't save my settings ... Which is annoying. The app looks great though
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:17:33
Thanks for the fix. This app needs more love :) is there an ipad app in the works?
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:31:46
Great! Can't wait. Thanks for the e-mail. I wrote a review in the app store for you :)
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:37:27
I'm laughing. Not the kind of laughter that something is funny.... Nope. The kind of laughter that i'm stressing out. Almost crying i guess.... Ha...haha...HHHHAAAAAAAAAAAHAAAAAAHAAAAAAHAHA. 
Like that 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:04:52
You made my day

Download Electrum, use a long password and store them. Not trying to rip you off, but if you need help or a step by step guide, PM me
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:56:56
Nice one. It doesn't really matter who he (or they are) is. But i think he's still among us. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:25:36
I would be interested!
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:11:14
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:53:21
I wonder how this will affect the price ... 
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:04:13
So, is this app safe? How are the coins stored? 
@_date: 2013-10-12 13:26:10
Nope, not yet
@_date: 2013-10-17 16:25:38
There will be 20 replacements in no time

Mycelium is android only. I have an iphone. But thanks for all the feedback :) 
@_date: 2013-12-15 13:52:28
Berlin and Amsterdam
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:27:20
I don't think they will ever reveal this to the public
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:06:42
Nice :)

Here we go again
@_date: 2013-10-15 21:41:47
We still are, but not for long
@_date: 2013-10-22 05:34:57
Good times
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:53:24
Dogecoin was just for fun, but it's quickly becoming a pump and dump coin. Unlike litecoin, which i like. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 18:00:24
I asked that allreafy. You can exchange your btc for money at a partner of coinkite (someone who has a terminal). 
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:54:43
Bit coins. People need to stop doing this. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:29:11
Bitonic is awesome. Pay for the coins, have them in your account within almost 5 minutes or faster :) 
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:49:48
This is actually a good read! Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:12:45
A milli a millie a milli .... 
@_date: 2013-10-17 08:24:21
Well, that escalated quickly
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:00:53
That is not what i'm trying to say. But okay, if that is what you make of it ... 
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:21:14
And the speculation goes on. I think the altoid wallet is pretty accurate, but i don't know about this one
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:03:00
It's more secure. Computers can crash. Storing them offline is the best option. Write the private key down and save it somewhere
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:41:33
Silk road stuff ... That was a year ago. I stayed for the coin :)
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:00:47
Nvm. Ignore. I just saw the ltc explorer. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:21:20
Why downvote this? Here, have an upvote :) 
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:37:50
The most useless post on christmas day... Wow. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:09:37
Rize Chikun!! 
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:19:52
Hmmm ... Strange. The transaction has alot of confirms. People should upvote this topic. This looks rather 'scammy'. But still, keep trying to e-mail support. I wish i could help you some more, but i think the problem lies with the exchange. And bombarding them with e-mails wouldn't help. 
Give me some time to figure this out. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:50:34
This is the level of reddit nowadays
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:11:12
Yup, i'm aware of that. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 12:38:20
Banks in general are not bad. The people who run them are. But when i have thousands of dollars in bitcoins i want to manage them myself, so when something goes wrong, i only blame myself. 
I love all the online wallet services out there, but pc wallets like electrum are not that hard to use. The only problem for new people investing in bitcoins are storing them offline or on a paper wallet. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:25:28
Must be nice
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:26:33
Not yet, although coinbase is getting easier. With governments watching bitcoins every move, it's not yet possible to do this. I think time will tell. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:35:54
I doubt that Japan will dribe the price up like China did. Their government is like no other. But still .... Who knows. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:01:16
The dude needs to chill out a bit. Still, he's funny. BUT NOT SO LOUD MAX!! WE CAN HEAR YOU!! 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:45:14
Great! I'm going to pick one for my girlfriend :) thank your wife for accepting bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:02:57
Yup, the site was acting a little weird. Everything okay now
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:49:08
You sir, are correct. A Mac is great, but not for mining. Have an upvote! 
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:59:43
Why not do this for litecoin? 
@_date: 2013-10-10 17:21:09
They have the authority to close the account whenever they want. I think you violated the TOS though ... 
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:26:20
Some people are in it because they believe in crypto (me). 
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:21:01
I'm holding 
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:09:17
Amsterdam has a great atmosphere. I live in Eindhoven. But i'm in Amsterdam most weekends. Really would like to live there! Or Berlin. 
@_date: 2013-10-13 17:07:09
Hackers would love this
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:46:38
That was a little to small. I'm going to donate a higher amount in a minute :) 
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:33:18
So tell me, why hate on litecoin? 
@_date: 2013-10-16 16:19:32
Should be a fun ride
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:25:53
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:24:55
In time, we will get rid of the stupid and dumb speculators because they lost to much money. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:16:07
@_date: 2013-10-19 19:04:24
This is accurate. Read the news, browse forums and watch the markets. Make a prediction and buy or don't ... 
I am enjoying the ride :)
@_date: 2013-10-14 08:36:43
If you are in it for the long run.... Every month when i get my money, i put in small portions of it. Overall, i'm happy, but don't expect that it will just rise.
The price will correct itself, stay there for a while because people will sell, and then rise again.
@_date: 2013-10-08 19:52:58
I was thinking of something like blockchain, so i can install the app on my phone. Is blockchain also safe? I only use my online wallet for a small portion of coins. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:36:15
 last online: December 12. You should message him and post here: 
@_date: 2013-10-11 17:49:49
I really believe that the author has to do more research. This is just narrow minded and stupid
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:35:58
Thank you for finding this. Big up!
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:45:23
Good to hear :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:25:33
A pretty nice tool. Thanks dude. Have an upvote. I'm going to donate some coins. They were about 10 bucks worth .... Blame the chinese
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:17:42
A pc is still good for something :) 
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:14:07
Yup, here in Holland people are quite aware of the existence of bitcoins. There is still alot of work to do ... 
@_date: 2013-10-08 20:04:44
Thanks :) i'm gonna have some fun investing in bitcoins and being part of a great community :). I try to avoid exchanges for the time being. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:05:20
You should go away .... Shoo! 
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:27:32
Like big companies, they need competition to stay sharp. That is the same with bitcoin and litecoin. There's no: "one to rule them all". There is just: Let's feed on each others failure and succes. Thats the mentality that will get crypto mainstream. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:53:12
Strangely enough i agree with you on a certain level. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:54:33
And you don't have to worry about the volatility
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:49:49
I might consider trying this
@_date: 2013-10-16 10:41:55
So? The dollar is no better, but this will not stop our crypto currency to rise. I agree with you, but people have to stop with the conspiracy theory's that the government will stop bitcoin. Alltogether, people have more power as long as we stick together.
Now that the value is rising, speculators will come. This has to stop also before it creates a new bubble. Greed is the biggest problem right now. Not uncle sam.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:04:44
Lol really, downvote? I'm on your side guys ... 
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:26:34
Nice :) i have it at the office also :) always a good addition
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:07:30
Scammers get so creative these days.... 
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:09:14
Ok need to do that again. Wanted to give away my first tip xd
@_date: 2013-10-16 19:40:04
Here's a tip: i don't want to sound rude, but people ask the questions alot. It is not realistic to think that the USD will collapse. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:58:27
Dogecoin and hobonickel. Oh and Quark
@_date: 2013-12-22 10:51:41
There's some movement going on....
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:56:04
Nice :) why didn't i think of this?! It's actually a great idea! 
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:18:04
I hardly call it a crash. The media was so positive about btc. When the price falls, expect to see more of the bullsh*t articles. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:17:23
Much fuq
Such seqx
@_date: 2013-10-10 22:12:07
I guess, because the app and the site are slow. Quickly sent my btc to my pc wallet just in case. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 20:56:23
Don't know. Sometimes reddit looks like "flameville"
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:37:42
Would be awesome. But are people really interested in this? And, how would it earn money? People can't just do this 24/7. Maybe record small clips / reports and podcasts. Then play them. And sometimes some live shows with interviews through skype..... So who's in? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:24:12
Thanks :) yeah i'm going to make a blog, introduce myself, etc. But mainly what i have achieved in the past few years. I want to maintain a certain level of trust with everyone. 
@_date: 2013-10-11 18:43:18
Have you double checked the address? Is your pc wallet connected to the internet and is the whole blockchain in sync? 
@_date: 2013-10-10 22:12:50
I think they are under a DDoS attack or something
@_date: 2013-10-11 22:54:36
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:34:33
Damn .... And i thought the crash hurts.... But this. Is there no way to recover it? 
@_date: 2013-10-11 19:43:07
This, sir, is well said
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:02:50
Thanks :) sounds like a plan
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:31:22
Me happy
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:53:49
Try bitpay. You can exchange the coins to fiat with them :) they do it for you. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 10:42:04
Yeah well ... I saw this graph just as much as the bubble graph that people put on reddit, i've had it .. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 19:29:10
Always in for a new business accepting bitcoin :) 
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:02:46
No man.... Not original anymore. You are just asking for money. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 22:26:56
Fees are damn high. I tried it twice.. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:15:09
Me 2. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 16:22:13
I own a business and i would really love to try out a terminal! I spoke to you on twitter. I live in Amsterdam, and i think alot of people will be interested in this :) 
Still waiting for an invite :( 
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:22:36
Litecoin was, but the newer and more useless coins are. Because not enough people mine them, it's easy for an attacker to do this.
In theory, bitcoin can be attacked as well. But it's nearly impossible. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 08:23:06
This is awesome! 
@_date: 2013-12-27 14:05:44
It is :€) i can confirm
@_date: 2013-12-11 09:54:38
Haha yeah i know the feeling. But i gave up explaining what bitcoin is :( . I found something :) 
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:24:02
@_date: 2013-12-15 13:57:05
So wealth, much gain, many fractions, wow
@_date: 2013-10-17 18:00:54
It's a "war" on drugs for the feds that can't be won. They spend the tax payers money on tracking digital drug kingpins. Sounds like science fiction to me, but it's true. 
Still waiting for the new pablo escobar of the online drug market and an oscar winning movie about it... Oh and rappers talking about hiring a hitman with bitcoins... 
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:01:57
This sounds like an awesome idea :) going to look into it. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:30:42
I think you should use another exchange. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:10:54
Thanks :) can't wait! 
@_date: 2013-12-24 12:15:15
Sucks. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 20:23:59
Yup, you are not mistaking :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:24:35
Haha! Nice one
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:17:39
Can't blame them. Have you told them about bitpay? 
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:59:57
Could you just put a translation here? 
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:41:04
Dirty mind
@_date: 2013-10-17 21:02:15
Almost certain it will be
@_date: 2013-10-09 07:11:57
Thanks :) i have google authenticator, a few wallet backups on my usb stick and two different passwords. That should do the trick! 
@_date: 2013-10-19 17:19:59
Media hype incoming! 
@_date: 2013-10-20 12:21:51
Winning topic
@_date: 2013-12-14 11:44:31
Dude ... 
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:45:36
This! Have an upvote sir. How should we start with this? 
@_date: 2013-10-11 18:43:56
And can you see any confirmations? 
@_date: 2013-12-22 16:44:29
This will make everyone rich. So i can't think of a scenario that someone will do this
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:43:46
That .... Is correct! 
@_date: 2013-12-27 09:02:53
Weeeeeee!! :D
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:27:57
@_date: 2013-10-16 18:18:07
What exactly do you mean by that?
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:15:36
Pointing fingers ... How cute. Don't feel threatened ... 
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:14:06
Ha! Scaaaaaaammmmm
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:43:55
I just shat my pants
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:19:17
Sucks man! I hope you'll find him
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:38:09
That's risky. Would be awesome if you are an early adopter of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:24:24
Haha it sure is. Let's concentrate on the drop now .... Meh ... China officially out
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:16:36
Much fees, Such banks, Wow, much bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:08:32
You sir, are awesome
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:50:13
Good job! Have an upvote :) 
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:15:41
Thanks :) looks pretty good
@_date: 2013-10-11 18:06:13
I'm glad that SR is gone now. Although there are alot of websites like SR. Silk Road and bitcoin were in one sentence in the mainstream media. That will hopefully change
@_date: 2013-10-17 07:21:59
Nope, but you are talking about an event that would not happen in maybe hundreds of years. Maybe much more.  
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:08:09

Okay, so no answer from support whatsoever? Did you double check the address before sending?
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:24:04
PM these guys on bitcointalk:  freeworm, Bter, Bter.com
I could try also, but it would be better if you do it. I'm gonna check when they've been online.

Yearly trip to Amsterdam. Pun intended
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:37:42
The nine streets are nice. Trouw Amsterdam :) etc. I love to go there on weekends
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:02:30
Could you re-post the link? 
@_date: 2013-10-16 18:45:50
That is what i love about the coinkite concept
@_date: 2013-10-11 17:34:32
Signed up :) can't wait to give it a go
@_date: 2013-10-16 18:11:44
Oops, looks like reading while cycling is not very good. I think it will be something for the "near" future
@_date: 2013-10-21 22:29:34
Let's flip a coin again
@_date: 2013-10-10 17:37:05
They have the same thing in The Netherlands. It's a virus with message from the "police" and you can't access your files anymore. Paying in bitcoins won't decrypt the files tho... 
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:31:45
You just don't get it
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:47:37
Haha, that was all i got xd 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:10:32
Going lower
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:38:51
Would be awesome
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:11:33
But still, this is the correction that we need for bitcoin, so it can become mainstream.
