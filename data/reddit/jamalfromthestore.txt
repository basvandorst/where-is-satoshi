i still believe bitcoin is going to continue to go up in value, as high as 100K and i wouldn’t be surprised if it went higher. 
I believe the recent volatility was due to tons of people coming in expecting to make a quick buck and fleeing once they saw a drop. 
Ive been in since around ~$2000/btc and i don’t have any intention of leaving anytime soon. This is just another bump in bitcoins long and fruitful road

He claims to “read” a book a day but has also said that he doesn’t read the whole book, he mostly just skims the book for new information

Well i initially bought in around ~$2000/BTC so I’m still at about 3-4x initial investment, up around $10,000. I definitely don’t have nearly as much as before but still a lot more than I started with so I’m happy
