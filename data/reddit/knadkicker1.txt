I don’t believe investors would ever let it fall that far. There are too many eyes on bitcoin right now and so many are waiting on the sidelines for the market to stabilize or for a cheaper buy in price. I would be surprised if it hit $5000. My personal opinion is that big players are squeezing the little peons out of this market in hedging a better position before it really takes off again

You were not the only one. I just posted earlier that I’m sitting out to, but we aren’t the only ones. It will recover but a big chunk of money is sitting on the sidelines waiting for the right time to buy back in. I believe it can go down to 8000 or lower by Monday. There is so much money on the sidelines right now that the rumors of tether quantitative easing are circulating right now. Basically they had to print 1 billion more dollars/Fake dollars in order to cover the dip last week

Just when you think a crypto is going to do something, it does the exact opposite. I had a huge stake in Cardano before it exploded and completely missed that train. I beat myself up every day about it, but at least I took a hefty profit when I did cash out. Find a technology that you personally admire and stick with it. For me, it’s Vechain. They are making huge moves behind the scene and securing massive contracts from the financial sector to supply chain logistics and even higher education. Rebrand in a few weeks. Highest potential IMO. Just like Cardano and Neo, it is much better than Ethereum and could surpass it this year. Actual real use cases is where I’m putting my money. Not to trash Ethereum because I really believe in its project too. Ether is my bitcoin

Everybody wants to drag down in the weeds because they know so much more than everyone else. I don’t need to be lectured about overclocking either. I’ve been doing this for sometime. It’s not $300 better than the 1060. I game at 1440p for the record I should’ve known better than to even make a comment on game Reddit. I have personally on both cards and did the EVGA upgrade from the 1060. It’s not that much of a difference. The 1060 is a good card

I have to agree about the GTX 1080. I bought one last year for gaming only. I do not mind crypto, but it is only slightly better than my old 1060 and this one’s overclocked. I think the 1060 is the best deal you can get today. You can’t do 4K gaming, but you can’t do that with the 1080 either

100% correct! We are in a bear market and people need to remember that. We have a descending wedge where the price cannot break above. Look at the volumes and sell walls. I would stay away from big coin for at least a week. Not to mention that this market could take a while to softly land. 10K, 11 K, 9.5 K, you get the point. It will be small balances until it settles at the bottom. Once people are comfortable to reinvest, you will see stability. I think we still have another week to a month of a downtrend. I am no expert, but I have learned a few things. Nothing wrong with sitting out until you are comfortable investing your money. Not to mention, the whales behavior is a heavy influence and it pays to watch what they’re doing

Not a fan of Shitcoin cash, but it isn’t wise to ignore that many do believe in it. I purchased a little myself because it is fairly consistent with the price of bitcoin. I still believe bitcoin core will be a store of value more than a day today transaction type of currency.Not asking to be downvoted or controversial, but there are many people who do prefer bitcoin cash for the moment. I don’t understand why people believe that there will only be one Victor. There will be many that win and some people will prefer one while others prefer another
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:44:47
Great analysis. I do have to point out that this year is different because of institutional involvement that wasn’t there last year. Too many governments and banks eyeing and manipulating. Of course it could drop to 1-2K, but I believe the whales won’t scare our money out and away too much. They want us to reinvest, and if it drops to 1-2K, it will take a substantial time to rebuild. People may take a long time or never trust again. They control the market and this is their game, but they want this to grow, not collapse. I’m waiting for at least sub 9K before I put another $ in. Also, I want to see stability (not today). It could take a month to fall to the “bottom.” Bitcoin is also detached somewhat from other currencies to an extent. There are ways to make $ even in a bear market. Bears definitely want to drive the price down, but they also need our money invested to pull money from. Their will be respites of increasing value to lure investors. Driving the price down to 0 fucks them long-term.

Coinbase. Download on a safe device. No porn! Set up bank account or credit card and identification. It maybe takes 15 minutes at most. You will need your ID to take a picture of it. Make sure did you do your security on the set up. You need to back up and write down the recovery because it’s imperative that you do not lose it in case you may need it. That way you can open the wallet on any other computer and import it to that computer. When you make your first purchase, you can buy a part of a bitcoin. Decimal points. 0.1 bitcoin is about $120 usd right now. It takes a few days to get your big coin deposited into your account. But don’t worry the price is locked in when you make the purchase. Also you can watch the graphs on coin base. That will get you started, but you need to do a lot of homework on how to do this because there is a whole other side to it. It’s a red pill and you will never look back. It’s fun and scary. Good luck

I bought half a bit coin Monday night at $11,700. I’ve been waiting over a month for this supposed dip that hasn’t come yet. It’s stabilized at 11,600 for couple days, so I bought in some and I’m glad I did. I kind of want to see a correction, that way it shows Healthy signs and more people will be eager to get in. Plus I wouldn’t mind buying it at $8500 again. Can’t believe I’m saying that. A month ago I would’ve been insane

I look at the world and the future through the Ethereum lenses. Bitcoin is the tip of the iceberg. Digital trade is coming and there will be a massive reallocation of wealth and stability across the world over the next decade. Prices will have to stabilize globally, and that is a huge feat. I see Blockchain first, then I look at everything that will be built on this. I view it differently than you do, but I believe that the future will be decentralized and everything will be cloud based and that includes value also. Bitcoin may fail one day, but no time soon IMO. I am more excited about Ethereum and Cardano than bitcoin. The beauty of all of this is that the possibilities are endless and this is the free market competing to fill a new sector. I personally believe that most skeptics are wrong about crypto and that has been proven over and over. I’m 100% confident in my position and will never look back. This is a genie that cannot be put back in the bottle

It may not seem like a big deal, but Japan is the third largest global economy and they have fully embraced it. Who’s to say what could happen. This isn’t your average stock. Some people look at it as an asset, some people look at it as currency, some people look at it as leverage. Personally I think they will want to siphon a small portion off the top. That means they will want it to increase steadily over time, but, if it gets too big, they will destroy it. I’ll look at it from the eyes of John McAfee, I know he’s crazy but he has a good point. We only see it as going up in value in relation to the dollar, the rest of the world sees it as a more stable currency than the currency that they use in their countries. Japan for example has been inflating the yen for 20 years. Venezuela is in full collapse. Many nations in Africa see this as the first opportunity that they’ve ever had to break free of their governments control. It’s much bigger than one country though and we are becoming a global economy at a super fast rate.

I cannot believe people are on here actually arguing on the half of the IRS! It saddens me how far our ambitions have sunk. Funny you should bring up numbers. People that make 9325 and less, don’t pay any federal income taxes. As a matter of fact, we give people benefits for having more kids. Earned income tax credit is a joke, it’s money redistributed down the food chain. I’m not against helping the poor, but we have 50 million fucking people on food stamps! That’s not the way I want my fucking money spent. I didn’t agree to it. I didn’t vote for. I’m not gonna sit here and defend the IRS stealing your money. Have you ever had to fight the IRS?

That’s exactly the benefits of these ideas going back and forth here. I agree with what u said, especially with token prices, like Ripple, for example. If Ripple gets too expensive, then customers will use another platform. Ethereum is still young but quite different in that regard. Ether and Cardano are building competitive platforms where, I believe a demand will exist for using these blockchains. I have a lot of faith in these. Also, no one is working on a music application for blockchain, so in interested in seeing how this turns out. These are the “power line” utilities being constructed for endless possibilities, including voting and p2p connections and transactions with malleable programming. This is why I like Cardano. They are learning from Ethereums mistakes and waiting for the technology before going balls deep. As far as Bitcoin, there will be a bubble. As crazy as this sounds, the real capital hasn’t even poured in yet, so I believe there is still time. That said, Litecoin is much cheaper, faster and much easier than using Death Star levels of electricity. But, what will the governments do? They will merge with each other, to an extent, and I believe they will slowly regulate crypto but not destroy it. Buying and selling limits for example and taxes through exchanges. They will eventually try to peg its price to something though, but who knows. The technology is more fascinating to me than money

Also I highly recommend watching videos on YouTube about crypto investments. Bit coin is a tiny piece of a massive industry that most people don’t know about. I’ve actually made more money on other coins then bitcoin. Big coin scares the shit out of me! It defies logic but I have made a good bit of money with it. I’m not talking millions or anything like that, I’m one of the little guys. If you think it’s expensive today, wait two weeks

A lot of these companies are going to proof of stake Which will help to lower the transaction costs, what about the concept of a third-party sending and receiving I’ll use all throughout the day from everyone paying with bit coin, and then doing one large transaction every hour? I guess the lightning network. When people buy gold, they don’t transact bricks of gold every 10 seconds, it’s a process, so that it keeps its value and it’s supposed to be somewhat difficult to cash in and out of. I’m waiting on a large company to place their ass on the line and back up bitcoin with their company. Bitcoin equals Amazon for example. Or how about a country saying that we will back the price of bitcoin with a certain resource. I don’t think it’s going away, it’s growing too freaking fast now. They will find a better third-party to handle the micro transactions throughout the day. And I’m not surprised that other coins are doing well too.

U can look at my other posts on Reddit and see I came from shit, alcoholic parents, homeless and on drugs 10 years ago. Once I got tired of accepting that lifestyle, I made changes, just like most others can do, and crawled my way upward. I never have had the mentality that society owes me anything.

Make sure that you open up your destination wallet first and copy the receive address. Make sure that address matches. Then open up the place where you were sending the crypto currency from and paste and send. Always verify the last four. Make sure that you do not send bitcoin to Ethereum wallet or Litecoin to a bitcoin wallet. 
Once you’ve got that figured out, then you can move on to the bigger things and open up an account on Bittrex. Personally that’s the exchange that I use, and you can trade anything with bit coin on that site except for iota. It’s very safe and you will have to go through another identification submission. Be sure to watch what you put in an out also, because short term capital gains or 40%. Anything over a year is taxed at 15% The IRS keeps tabs through coin base. So they know what’s going in and out of that site, once you transfer your bit coin from there, it’s anyone’s guess. Just know that the government is itching to come in and regulate. If you cash out of any of your currencies, don’t deposit back into your personal account, unless you are ready to pay the taxes. Like I said, short-term gains at 40%, long-term gains 15%

Do you honestly think that we should borrow $500 billion a year? Every time they do, money is printed and value is decreased. It’s an extra tax if you will. Inflation. We all know what was meant by that, that gives Congress the power to borrow when absolutely necessary. Such as in time of war. The original articles said the exact opposite of this. They did not want our Country in debt. They did not want the federal reserve. They have bastardized our constitution since its beginning. This goes back to the “general welfare” clause. They have use that as an excuse to regulate and monitor everything. Just like the fourth amendment. Today they argue that Internet was not included in the fourth amendment. Do you really buy that horse shit? They don’t mind trashing the second amendment. What about our First Amendment, which includes our freedom of speech. In this case, money is speech. I vote with my dollar every time I use it. Some people just won’t understand, they just except the status quo. They don’t do their research and understand the founding principles of the United States. We were not meant to have a $4 trillion overlord. We were definitely not meant to have the government spending so much more than they take in promising that we will pay it back. That is not even the real number, the real number is $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities. Look it up. They never talk about this. This is money that they have promised today to pay people tomorrow. Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, etc. Social Security is the biggest Ponzi scheme in the world. If that was not the case, then how did people get benefits to it right away. I mean as soon as it was past, people started receiving money. There’s no lockbox. Your money is not sitting somewhere waiting for you. It’s just debt piled upon debt.

I hate politicians and bureaucrats because they hate us and they take advantage of us. They go on television an insult us and then they are laughing behind our back’s.

Have you ever asked yourself where the hell these politicians come from? Who picks these people to run. I don’t mean who we vote for, I mean the choices we have to pick from. I’ll look at it from their point of view, I get to spend other people’s money and you get to pay for it. It’s amazing how some people hold these douche bags up as people of the people. Barf! All they do is redistribute wealth in a way that will benefit them next election. I’m sick of it and I believe most Americans will agree. Income tax is disgusting and it’s wrong morally. Stealing someone’s income before they even see it themselves and I making them beg for it back at the end of the year. Like I said, I’m all for paying taxes on consumption. The power to tax is the power to control, and ultimately it will be our fate if it continues to grow. I mean the IRS. You should look up the iron triangle. Reagan spoke about it and you will see that They have built a power structure that cannot be broken. That is why I am so for block chain technology.

I disagree. There will be many currencies used in the future. Some governments will embrace one while the others don’t. Some will be better in one area than another. It’s like Amex, visa, MC, debit, PayPal, Money orders, and good ole toilet paper money. Do u honestly think Amazon will sit back and just accept Bitcoin? If they have half a brain, they will create their own currency. That’s the point of all of this, certain gift cards have certain benefits for using specific vendors and rewards. Really think before u shrug off other currencies. I hate my experience with using Bitcoin so far. It’s slow as shit and expensive. What happens when your value plummets by half?

Every country is racing to the value their currency, and as long as everyone does it, we don’t notice it too much. It’s only when we compare it to something that doesn’t lose its intrinsic value. I had this argument with people all the time. And they say but the dollar is value, why is that? Oh, it’s because someone said so. And these interest rates are going to come back and destroy all the progress made in the last nine years. I think the bubble started in 2009. Bitcoin has just risen above it

Why would Wall Street dump it first thing? They would want to draw more people in first. I think there’s a long way to go before it REALLY hits the wall. Remember, it’s bigger than Wall Street. It’s Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Europe and much of Africa is getting in. Venezuela, Brazil,   I don’t trust Wall Street, but think from their point of view, if they blow out the public trust, Then their game is over. They will put downward pressure at first because it’s way over the top right now, but they want to show the world that they can tame this beast... it’s the psychology of the lottery, if no one ever wins, no one plays. Of course they are drooling to get in, but remember, why crash it right away? Especially when u can run it up much more. The speculation hasn’t even started yet. Yes, more people are buying in, but everyone I’ve gotten interested has been properly told; leave it alone. It will drop, but it’s temporary

That’s why I don’t live in Europe. Maybe you guys are OK with socialism and redistribution of wealth. Maybe you’re OK with living in apartments are condominiums. I’m not. We pay taxes through a lot of other mechanisms besides federal income taxes but I don’t want the government dictating healthcare. I don’t want the government stealing my money to give to bums and sit around and smoke dope all day. It pisses me off to 50 million Americans are on food stamps and half of those people are cheating the system. It pisses me off how corrupt the politicians are. So yes, we are different.

This is my vision. As of now, people value crypto in relation to $ amounts with hopes of fiat exchange. What happens when people just quit converting into fiat? Kind of like where we are now, debit and credit purchases make up 90% of transactions and no one questions the value behind that. They accept it because of trust and the fact that the next person will accept it. Cash is becoming more and more inconvenient. 
The best example of what will happen when they ban crypto is to look at China. There is a massive underground black market for it and demand. Miners simply use VPNs and much of the Bitcoin mining is still done in China.

I’ve always suspected that the Feds and other global powers will coordinate a price fluctuation so bad that people will either give up or lose everything. This will be they way they attempt to destroy cryptocurrency. They have the CIA and the computing power to do it. All they have to do is create a really advanced AI or not to wash trade or hit the exchanges will millions in microscopic volumes. They will basically play the game better than these whales and make a fortune in the meantime. I hope I’m wrong but there isn’t enough mainstream adoption to counter such an entity as big government and big banking. What’s to stop them from building the largest miner and coordinate a 51%? It’s too quiet right now in the regulation subject which is scary. I could be 100% wrong, and I hope I am, but I constantly think about it. They hate the threat of Ethereum because they can’t control it. They also won’t sit back forever to allow this system to dislodge their power structure. 
I say this as an avid believer and investor.

I hope we can get more adoption by bigger corporations and the public. Enough time will let it become more tangled in the economy where no one will want to pull the rug out. In other words, some of the bigger players who have ties to big banks or the government will have vested interest and that will hopefully deter them from over regulating. I do worry about what will happen once more big money comes into the sphere. If two or more parties get together that have billions of dollars on reserves, they could wash trade this market in any direction they want. I know they already do that to an extent, but the more to get involved, the worse it will become. I feel like they manipulate the market up when they’re long positions are in place, and then manipulate it down and ride the shorts all the way. Basically we get fucked in both directions. I just wish I could train myself to not pay attention.

I believe that they will try to pump and dump to bring it down. Remember that bitcoin only makes up half of 1% of the total investments in the world. When it crosses to 2 - 5%, then it will become a problem. Personally, I believe that if people do it legitimately and extract their money through coin base for example and actually pay their taxes, they won’t have a problem with it. Also you have to remember that most countries are embracing bitcoin, not the other way around. And we all know a global currency is coming. My opinion is that bit coin will not emerge as the victor. The big banks have enough money to destroy ANY market, and eventually they will if it continues, as is. Who controls the government? The banks. They will not let anyone stand in their way that threatens to undermine their system. But I still think that is a few years off. Crypto markets are exploding, yes, but they make up a tiny portion of total global investments, but that is changing fast. Gold makes up 7% of the global investments. Crypto makes up 0.5% right now. I would watch the market cap number, once it starts to dethrone gold, then I would be concerned.
For the record, the government is a threat, but the banks are a bigger threat. I am more concerned of the latter. I also want to point out that every time they crack down on something, a black market emerges. I believe that crypto currency will thrive in a black market regardless of what they do. People also forget that currency is only what we believe it is

It’s unhealthy not to have a correction at this point. But, the problem is that, the second it falls a couple 100 bucks, the automatic buying caps kick in not allowing it to happen. Soon, some will cash out but i fear that the public bandwagon is running in and the “real” speculators haven’t made it yet. 
Please don’t underestimate the hedge funds and POS banks like JP Dumbass and his trillions of dollars in sway money. They have enough money to overwhelm the system by pumping and dumping. It could get real bumpy. I love bitcoin and own 1, but I also own ether and others. These bastards will rush in and push market up so fast, and once everyone has invested their money, the big dicks will pull a MASSIVE chunk out, crashing the system and taking everyone’s money ��, then buy the dip with all the profits.

It’s a great comment, but that goes for everything in society. If money stops flowing, Everything collapses. That’s all the stock market is is a future gamble. That’s what interest rates are set on. That’s why we have inflation. Because it keeps velocity up in the monetary system. Minor Inflation is not a bad thing. It’s when we have the big dickheads at the top of the pyramid manipulating the system in the big banks gaming the system and government fostering those actions. A real stable currency should be released slowly overtime in accordance with population growth but we all know that greed destroys even a perfect system. I love big coin but I do believe it is an experiment, and a complete mystery as to who the fuck created it! I personally think that it will be around but it will be so valuable that transactions will be difficult to do in and out of that. Kind of the same thing when you invest in a 401K, moving money in and out of it is difficult and takes an act of Congress and usually occurs a huge penalty. That is because they want stability to an extent. I believe there will be another widespread currency that is adopted for day-to-day transactions that will be centralized and government controlled. That is not what I want but I am not stupid and actually believe that government will stand back and let us create our own money. Those fuckers will shut it down so fast. The IRS is already subpoenaed coin base for their transaction records. Regulations are coming. decentralized currency will be great for the micro economies that will emerge with block chain technology

I disagree 100%. There are hundreds of other countries across the world who would beg for bitcoin. The exchanges could relocate anywhere in the world. Money could be funneled through different avenues and eventually get to where you want to. Drugs have been illegal for 100 years. But somehow they manage to get here, and the money somehow manages to get back to the dealers, and so on up the chain it goes. They somehow still find a way to launder that money. They will create another avenue unless they embrace it.

JP Morgan is a fraud and so is all fiat currency. What’s to stop the Fed from freezing assets or declaring the dollar worthless. Think about it. Bitcoin is a hybrid quasi asset/commodity. It uses the same concept of the dollar, only in reverse. Cages are going to be rattled once this really begins to go mainstream. I believe this is the beginning. Calling it a bubble is rubbish because it IS NOT tied to a single currency. Flip the graph upside down. It is the dollar that is falling along with the long-term faith. As Varys said in GOT, power is where people believe it is. We detest banks and his ilk. What gives gold value? Nothing. It cannot be eaten or hauled around. It won’t power a home. It only has value when people believe it has value. We could use rocks if we wanted to.

You are more right than you know. Currency is nothing more than what we believe it is. And for the naysayers out there, they say that bit coin is backed by absolutely nothing! WTF is that $130 billion sitting there in that market? It’s your money that we’ve invested.! Our sweat and labor. We decide it’s value. This is what they don’t understand. Let’s play along with their argument for a second; bit coin is a Fiat currency. Then It is backed by a Fiat currency (global currencies) that we’ve invested, and by you calling bit coin a fraud, that means that the money we have Invested in it is a fraud also! How stupid do they think we are.So basically you’re telling us that we shouldn’t have faith in something that is priced and the current see that you asked us to have faith in? If bitcoin is a fraud, then so are dollars! And Euros, Yen, Bolivar

The signs are market cap and transactions. Sometimes some buy alt with bit and when they coincide. Trying to watch and decide on bitcoin short term is almost impossible. What the “outsiders” don’t understand is that u cannot compare stocks to dollar with bitcoin to dollar. It is almost independent of the dollar and becomes more so everyday. Also, more importantly is that this bigger than the US. It is a global participation and countries like Venezuela have no other alternative to put their $. I personally an extremely bullish and believe it hasn’t even begun the real ascent! There will be dips and some big ass dips, especially since it is worth much more today. It will go nuclear once it hits the daily news and vendors see that their profits could benefit. It will hit a wall in speed when too many but and transact more often. I would still diversify because there will be spin-offs due facilitate these transactions. Lite coin is a much better platform and is cheap enough to buy enough to make great profits within a year. Won’t be as much as bitcoin but much more stable. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:38:15
No offense, but u need to spend a few hours on YouTube and do some homework first. It’s not the same as a stock. U need to understand what’s behind bitcoin, because that is MUCH more important. Also look to other crypto and learn their business models. I still think Bitcoin is a great investment, even now since it’s under 10k. Once it crosses that, the real fun begins. But don’t sit here stalking and panicking because it’s extremely volatile. It’s due for a 30% drop but it will recover. Patience and more patience. Deposit and forget it. Come back in a year. Lol

Part of the back of my head says that the government is behind creating Bitcoin. Could be a test run for a digital currency. I believe they better embrace it or they will be cut out. Say we cross a threshold where a majority of the citizens begin using it, then they would see the dollar for what it is. Even if the us goes after it, it doesn’t matter because the rest of the world is embracing it. Google trends tells u everything u need to know. It’s definitely bigger than the US

Can u eat gold? Can gold make your lights comes on? Does gold power your vehicle? In a true economic crisis, money AND gold are useless. Gold only has value because people have long believed that it does. My point is that bitcoin reflects that faith being redirected away from dollars, gold, and the stock market. The real subject to be discussing is Blockchain. This is going to change everything and I won’t predict what crypto currency will do, but neither can the critics. Everyone has been 100% wrong. Now that is beginning to change and the bandwagon effect is soon to begin. This is a mere display that fiat currency is bullshit and no more valuable that the paper it’s printed on. Besides, you need to think outside of the United States. There are hundreds of emerging economies begging for this and a few of the larger ones are embracing it also. It will democratize our interactions in the future behind the governments back. People like myself believe that bit coin is more valuable than any currency. Because it is we who determine the value, not the Federal Reserve or some banking executive.

Well said. U have to view currency completely different. We’re so used to the dollar and the pricing system based on that that we forget to flip the graph upside down. Look at the bitcoin as the baseline because it is finite and the dollar drops as more try to get to baseline. I still wouldn’t let my guard down because they are scheming every day how to bring this system down. But who’s to say whether the Federal Reserve won’t skyrocket interest rates to combat. They are going to do everything in their power to maintain the supremacy of the dollar. The Silverlining is that Bitcoin is used worldwide.

It shows your immaturity about this. Your last Statement says 1000 words, you don’t have a solution. Because if you sit back and actually think, you will see that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Like I said, anything that puts more power in the hands of the people, I’m all for it. And I do not agree that capitalism has failed. Capitalism has created the standard of living that we have today, whether good people or bad created it, it doesn’t matter because everyone has benefited. That is my point, we have no clue who created bitcoin, but we can all benefit from it. I believe in a rising tide, that all can benefit if they’re willing to put the work in and live with their mistakes, and learn from their mistakes. It’s not fair, but fairness does not come from government, all we can do is try to shape this as we go along and make adjustments. I believe in Austrian economics, not Keynesian economics. And if you really want to make things better, you would stop down voting anyone who disagrees with you based on your own personal opinions. It shows that you were not willing to do your part.

Who is forcing you to work for someone that doesn’t pay you what you feel you are worth? Who is forcing you to take a certain job in the first place? What is preventing you from going to school or opening a business putting your ideas on display for others? What is stopping you from creating art or music? This idea that you are forced as a slave to work for someone is garbage. We live in a society where they Central Bank manipulating the currency and you call that capitalism. It is not true 100% This is not capitalism. Capitalism is free markets where people can choose which products they purchase according to the quality and price, it also includes people pursuing their own interest weather opening businesses or going to school. Obviously you haven’t read the book I stated because it talks about how we have obligations to help lift the poor up personally, not through government. If your neighbor is hungry you should take the responsibility to feed him, not force me to pay through government for stupid programs ripped off by people who refuse to work. We are not even close to capitalism and I’m sick of people trashing it who don’t know what they’re talking about. And as far as you calling it an idea, it is an idea. Where is this idea of yours where everyone is equal and happy. I have news for you, people are flooding to the United States because it sucks in a majority of the world. There are no other economic systems you can point to where people are freer than we are right now. We have issues, yes, major issues with our society, but it is the best thing we have at the moment. I’m not defending corporations running the country or big bloated government making our decisions for us. I am libertarian and I believe that people should make their own damn decisions and live with their own damn consequences. Now when your decisions affect me, that becomes a problem, and that’s where government comes in. When your rights interfere with my rights, you don’t have that right. People whine and complain water sitting there typing on their iPhone that was created by an idea sold at a fair price where to billion people can afford it. Quit complaining, capitalism does benefit people, and more people then it doesn’t. It is a fight between the free market and big power. I defend the free market, not the big powers that try and fight to suppress the free market. If you don’t like away a bank does business, don’t do business with them. If you don’t like a product that a company sells, don’t buy it. If you don’t like a job or the pay, don’t work there. If you don’t feel like you make enough money, do something else

The entire point of my first statement was people had to be moral. Without a good decent people, it would begin to morph into a monster that’s have today. That was the entire argument in the first place laid out by Adam Smith. He devotes an entire segment do it. Have you ever read Alexis Du Tocqueville? I’m not trying to insult you and I would appreciate you not downvoting my comments. My point is that there is no perfect economy for 7 billion people. Not one. There are flaws in every society, there are just less flaws in capitalism. I see socialism as an even more tyrannical system. The more power we put in the hands of government, the more power they take. I also do not believe in pure democracy. It becomes about the 51% at that point and that is very dangerous for the rights of the minority. There are no easy answers, But I see hope on the horizon with block chain technology, as it puts power back in the hands of the people. Hopefully you can see it that way too and we can both agree on that. It is my definition of a free market. If you remember, do United States was supposed to issue it’s own currency back by gold, but the Federal Reserve was created and destroyed the hopes of a true currency. It is one of the 10 pillars of communism, central banking with the control of credit in the hands of the state. I do not believe in a central bank. Really, ask yourself how do u solve these issues simultaneously? The answer is that you can’t, you can only appoint a referee to try to keep it fair-referee being government. I am not against government, I am against a $3 trillion government spending $1 trillion bombing other countries and destroying the dollar. I also do not agree how our government has picked winners and losers when it comes to the corporations. Walmart for example, pays their employees shit wages, and therefore their employees qualify for social benefits, in other words-we subsidize Walmart. That’s not capitalism. If you look up these definitions today, there are not true definitions anymore, such as liberalism. Liberalism used to mean liberty-not liberty through government, where government forces supposed free programs on the public, because nothing is free. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:37:04
Don’t worry, I reversed the down vote from the people defending Government issued toilet paper. The same people defend zero and even, negative interest rates. And they ask us who is high? You have to be really smoking something to think that it’s OK to continue to print money and have no ill side effects from that policy. Just like raising the minimum wage to 20 bucks an hour will benefit everyone. It’s magic! If we just paid everyone more money, everyone would be richer

@_date: 2018-02-08 23:26:38
I don’t disagree that crypto is in a nasty correction. But, it will come back much faster than a 50% correction in the stock market. I don’t invest in crypto’s for short-term trading. I own a few stocks, including Nvidia, but 50% of my portfolio is in crypto’s, especially right now when it is so cheap to buy. In six months, we will be talking about $35,000 bitcoin and $2000 Ethereum. Not to mention the other startups and ICOs.I’m not advocating that crypto currency should be everyone’s go to, but from my research, it is a very young market with massive potential to grow. Market cap is only at $400 billion today. That’s crumbs in comparison with the global economy. Block chain is creeping into every sector of the economy, especially Wall Street, whether they invest in it or they build their platforms on it. Ethereum has the potential to eliminate investment firms because anyone can build their own on top of Ethereum

When you step back and actually look at the roots of the entire financial system, you will see that is propped up entirely by faith. Anything has value as long as people believe it has value. That could change at a moments notice whether it’s US dollars, stocks, euros, or even gold. When shit hits the fan, dollars mean nothing, you can’t eat them, you can’t put them in your car as fuel, And no one will want them. I trust bitcoin more because no one is behind the scenes running the show. It is a program that cannot be altered or edited or hacked. It is maintained by we the people. And yes, I realize that you cannot use bitcoin if shit hits the fan either. I don’t think anyone could argue that online shopping is growing so large that it will consume at least 50% of all purchases within the next 10 years. Go on some of these websites and see if they are excepting bitcoin as payment, and that is just today. More and more people will begin to accept it as time goes on

Do you not realize that the only reason people believe in the dollar is because they are told to believe in it? Donely reason I except dollars is because the next man will except dollars in exchange for services I purchased from him. Bitcoin is becoming more valuable because more people will except it from the other person. That’s all money is! It’s a medium of exchange agreed-upon by two parties. Only this is not controlled or inflated by government

That’s exactly Wall Street’s wet dream. It’s also allows initial coin offerings to crowd fund in getting started. It’s a big deal.

Scandinavia is a horrible example, there are very few people to manage. The United States is 50 times the size of Finland. You’re not factoring work ethic either. Some people work harder than others. I also believe that these countries are headed for trouble. You cannot have a giant welfare system indefinitely. And as far as your examples about Nestlé and carbon credits, I absolutely agree. That’s my point about using a referee. How do you actually foster innovation without destroying it at the same time? Instead of attacking my argument, provide your solution. U attack everyone of my examples, But refused to provide a solution. People can easily opt out of participating in capitalism, move, simple as that, but pick your poison. I am willing to bet that even with the flaws we have, 70% of the world will give their left nut for a chance in the United States. And stop taking that example as me defending the status quo, because I’m not.

Adam Smith - Wealth of Nations. Read it. Capitalism is supposed to be rooted on top of a moral society. Without morality, greed sets in like a cancer. 
But acting like socialism or fascism isn’t rooted in greed is foolish. Where is this utopia that exists where everyone has the same stuff and they sing and wave to each other. Unicorns and leprechauns my friend. Capitalism gives everyone an equal opportunity to profit from their own intellectual abilities or labor and a free voluntary interaction between buyers and sellers. The US is always being held up as the “failure” of capitalism and its wrong to compare. We are a corporatism or corporate fascism state. People are also wrong about the term fascism, Fascism is the merger of the power of corporation and the power of state. People throw that term around and they have no idea what it really means. The US as long had a merger of big powerful corporations and a big powerful government. It is not a good example of pure capitalism. Singapore is capitalism. Hong Kong is capitalism and that’s why every business being choked off moves there.  
I get into it every day with people dealing with crypto currency. You idiots are trashing capitalism while participating in capitalism. You see the power it has the free people. And another thing, central banking is one of the main tenants of communism. Credit control in the hands of the state, that is not capitalism.

@_date: 2018-04-11 12:21:39
I get it. We live in an internet economy where cross nation and global transactions are becoming more of the norm. As long as one nation does embrace crypto and tie their banking to exchanges, there will be an on ramp for conversion. At some point people stop converting into fiat. People used to be paranoid about paper money since it was issued for actual gold deposits into banks, but as time went on, people began trusting their deposits and stopped converting. It’s much like online banking, I was skeptical at first, but began to intertwine into everyday transactions, virtually eliminating the need for cash - I rarely have cash, as most Americans and Europeans. I didn’t even mention Asia. Trends in Canada don’t dictate the global environment. But if u aren’t confident in investing - don’t do it. You have that right but remember Bitcoin has died 200 times and even proved me wrong- always riding out the storm. Been through much worse already
