From the link to provided, it says to instantly transfer back to my local currency but how would that be possible if transactions take longer than 24 hours? Just within the past 24 hours btc has had a 6.5% swing. 
I can accept this for my personal investments, but not as a merchant with a company. 
So how should I accept bitcoin unless I set the fee to be higher to allow instant or quick transactions?
How do you do it for your business?

May I ask, how do you do your accounting work when accepting bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:56:06
But do you calculate your revenue in the price of USD at POS or after the transfer of BTC back into USD?
For example, you sell a TV for .1 bitcoin. For simplicity sakes, it is worth $1,000. You take the .1 Bitcoin, then takes 24 hours to transfer the bitcoin back into USD, and now you get $1100 because BTC went up 10%. What do you write as your revenue, $1000 or $1100?

Ok thanks
But what do you suggest I can do to counter the volatility and still accept bitcoin with minimal fees?
If the prices start to drop, I can't afford losing a lot especially since it's my business. If my personal investment drops, I can take that risk but not my business that sees a great deal of transactions per day.
How can I make bitcoin work for my business then? I can't handle a $10,000 swing if btc suddenly drops 10% in a day.

But at $0.01 fees, wouldn't it take forever for the transaction to go through? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:40:53
At $0.01, wouldn't that be like 1sat/byte? That would take a long time. Also, with my business I will need to do the accounting. With the volatility of BTC, I need to input my sales transactions of time of sale which can fluctuate quite a bit if I convert back to fiat

I do small $5 transactions, but my volume per day is quite high. I've been a cash business so all of this is new to me. How do you handle your accounting work? Do you mark the sale in fiat at the time of sale, or after converting back to fiat? How do you deal with the fluctuations and volatility?
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:19:53
You've never said to use other coins, you mentioned that fees are not an issue, but now you said they are an issue.  So basically whatever you wrote  before is different now. 
I want to help BTC grow, but as a small business owner it doesn't seem viable.

They collect data. Tencent is a huge tech firm that branches out too many subsidiaries. They don't care about the 1% fees, they want your data
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:35:04
So in your books is your sale considered $1000 or $1100 revenue?

If I set up a gold trading company and when I do my accounting, it will obviously not show it is gold.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:39:01
Yes but to operate a two way ATM, I would need to open up a LLC and a business bank account for the fiat.

Well I can lie, but I don't think my accountant is willing to risk their license and lie for me when I show my P&amp;E and other tax related information.
Plus there are always random checks on businesses to see their activity. It's not that simple

Lots of gold here! Unfortunately the link to purchase doesn't seem to be loading for me :(

I live in HK and can try to pop by there when I get a chance. But like others have said, it's probably just a virtual office with no one actually there

Fuck HSBC, they are a bunch of crooks. Global bank is such a sham when they freeze or put holds on your account for legitimate purposes

I'm really surprised you couldn't find any information.
Yes you can buy with cash. You can do bank transfers to exchanges or physical cash through P2P exchanges.

$10,500 is the dip. When it's $25,000 you will be thanking yourself. Just buy a little each month

The price of the goods reflect this already. You don't know what percentage of a $10 product goes to what, all you know is that it costs $10. Maybe the item costs the owner $5 to buy but then the owner adds $3 to pay for the rent, $1 for marketing, $0.90 for profit, $0.10 for credit card fees. All you know is that it's $10
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:45:41
You are paying more by BTC regardless of points or not. $9 with a Visa and $9.06 with BTC. Plus many credit cards offer points or straight up 1-2% cashback
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:04:37
Without setting off the mob, what advantages does this have over regular cash or credit card? Isn't there a fee associated as well that just ruins the point?

If you go to a candy store and buy $10 worth of candy, it costs you $10. You can pay $10 in cash or $10 by credit cards but no matter what it's $10. 
The shop understands people might pay with credit cards so they price their candy accordingly. If it's a shop that accepts cash only, they might be able to price their candy lower at $9.50 or something.
Have you never used a credit card before?
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:47:55
The credit card fees are calculated into the total cost already. $9 is with the credit card fees regardless what payment method (cash, amex, visa, mc), $9.06 is with the credit card fees + btc fee.

Come on, let's be real here. People always mention things like computers, internet, mobile phones etc but forget the millions of other products that were posed as "the next best thing" that failed miserably
