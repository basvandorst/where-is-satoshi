I also am from the 2011 days of bitcoin, I personally think that people should not force average daily joe ppl to get into bitcoins. It does not help their lives much, and its too complicated to understand to be a viable investment.
That being said, if these two things go away, then naturally people will start using bitcoins on a daily basis since it is already shown that it is a good solid system. To overcome these, 1 i would assume people will naturally get smarter and more keen to newer tech. 2. we will eventually abandon all physical forms of a wallet/drivers ID/credit card and have cell phones do everything.
Next, like others said, bitcoin is too early for real adoption. Like the internet in 1993. fast forward 20 years, now internet is everyday thing. Only older generations are not used to it. Give us another 20 years, and everyone in a 1st world country will know how to use the internet.
When human society was using the bratering system, I am sure people rejected currency at first thinking that it was super risky and skeptical. something on the lines of "are you sure i can trade this coin for a pig later?!"
As for buyer protection and all the insurance stuff, it is not really fair to compare it directly to bitcoin. As the USD or any currency itself does not give inherent insurance or protection. Some protocol or entity adds a layer on top of the USD to give us protection and insurance. 
I believe in the future, that some entity will try too provide insurance or protection against bitcoin transactions ect. so that risk adverse people will feel safer. I am not so sure if will work though... someone has to pay a premium somewhere.

Look man, if you don't feel good about having bitcions, or feel like your "doing it wrong" then sell or spend ur bitcoins. It is as easy as that.
No point ruining/wasting ur life over this. Much better things to go do instead of staring at book orders and such hoping it doesn't go down.
Whatever choice you make, just remember if you lose money, oh well man. It's just money, you can always make more later in life.
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:35:44
Yeah, well compared to our current money system, at least the "few people" you talk of cant abuse their power and make more bitcoins.
Also, I think you under estimate the wealth gap in real life. I mean people own empires literally (and many many poor people).No one in bitcoin system can come close to toppling that.

Regardless of what you bought in at(10, 100, 1000, or 500), you should of done your research and decided it was a good long term idea to buy in.
If so, you should not be feeling despaired and have the tendency to dump it all b/c of fluctuations in the market...
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:20:03
Well there ya go man, just leave them there in cold storage.
You got ups and downs now, but just wait till the next war starts or the stock market crashes. Then u will see gold, commodities, and bitcoin skyrocket. Hope you wont be holding stacks of dollars when that happens man...
Go out do other things to take ur mind off things, play the Southpark RPG i hear its amazing. 
I know its hard to do this but, don't get caught up on money or having a profit all the time! people win at times people lose other times, that is life.

I play rent with mine, buy everything on Amazon, and VPN services. 
I only use fiat for food and bills.
Remember, using a few bitcoins for commerce will make the rest of your bitcoins go up in value.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:07:09
hahaha, thats great.
@_date: 2014-04-10 05:02:41
To be honest, yes you are.
If a bank gives u 1000 dollars in error into your bank acct, they will want it back for sure. even if you spent it. and they have legal recourse to get it back. I think most people can agree you should return it.
Now in your situation, you got free bitcoins and they want it back. If you were an honest person, you should of gave it back when you received it by accident. But its their fault for not noticing, so its not entirely your fault for keeping it too (realistically).
but now they noticed, and they want it back. So you should give it back. So to answer your question, yes you are at fault. Legally can they do something about it? probably not, but if you don't give it back, well then u are a scumbag. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 07:02:04
no one can really answer your question about the future man.
You should hold on until you need something and then use your bitcoins to buy stuff on amazon or pay rent ect. That could be tomorrow or years from now, up to you.

You know, negative power rates are a bad thing... 
That means the power system was on verge of collapsing and they had to do drastic things to avoid it. Also the power company lost money too 
This is problem with renewable sources, they are uncontrollable. Going 100% renewable is batshiit crazy. Imo.

Someone has to subsidize all the green energy technology. And you know subsidizing gets funded by ordinary ppl. In this case it's high energy rates.

No he kind of has a point, a bit harsh though.
Literally its asked non stop. no one can predict the future. 
its the same answer everytime. Random guesses, trying to time a market with a bunch of daytarders is easy way to lose money (or gain)
If you are nervous, you are doing it wrong.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:27:00
You really need to put a time frame on your bet. as you said it now, I would easily take it and then just call u up when it reaches 385, be it tonight or next year...
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:14:42
you call this daytarding.

Armory for offline, blockchain.info wallet for online.

Get a job bro. its not hard....
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:48:42
I seen ppl say this over and over. Why do people always want to buy in a dip and "beat the market"? ppl did it at 100 per bitcoin. They goofed. Again at 150, 200 ect. 
If you cant stand the risk. buy 100 bucks a week. average it out so you never go all in on a peak. its not efficient, but its better on your heart lol.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:42:43
Hmm, not bad I thought you were gonna say 24 hrs. Either-way, kudos to you for putting ur money where your mouth is. 
Most ppl wuss out lol.
@_date: 2013-01-02 18:49:00
It is the best way to opt out of the american dollar (which is gonna get weaker) and the government interfering with your financing (aka sales tax, capital gains tax, gold taxation)
Everyone can understand those two points and agree.

Don't be a scumbag and steal it man. Your probably a good person, but just wishing ya had more btc (dont we all lol?) But, someone is crying right now and freaking out. Best thing to do is to return it. 
If you still want to play the greed card, just leave it in the account. Bitstamp will fix the issue hopefully. If it is still there 6 months down the line, then you can keep it.
You say you could use an extra 0.5 btc for Christmas, but I bet that other person needs it way more lol considering he was probably planning on having it...
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:52:35
This guy is right. you should buy a gift based on what would make the person happy. If he is into new technology it would fit to give him a bitcoin or something. Otherwise, if you want you can buy the gift on amazon from bitcoins via Gyft.com so then indirectly ur helping bitcoin with the gift.
Side note, I convinced my roommate (also landlord) to let me pay him rent one time... I spent roughly 6000 dollars in rent with today's price lol. Hes really happy.

Daytarders wanting recognition for tarding it up? 
Srsly not wanting to be mean and all. But is there really a point to this post besides self verification from community?
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:48:10
its like daytarders fighting in the sandbox.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:41:18
Cash some out when you need it. Whats the point in cashing it out and shoving it into a bank and sitting there?
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:41:06
Here's my take on things:
Everyday, ppl try to give me financial advice. I ask, how much is ur portfolio? If it is more than mine, ill at least hear you out.
If not? stop trying to give me advice.
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:47:20
You should sell if you feel like you need to spend it on something. Otherwise, what is the point in selling it to just let your wealth sit in a bank?
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:31:44
You should probably not have that much in coinbase for safety reasons...
