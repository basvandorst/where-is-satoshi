I believe others have kind of answered your question but not the specific question you asked. 
If bitcoin is going up, the marketcaps of the altcoins can go up, even if their price in terms of bitcoin goes down. That's because bitcoin is going up faster than the exchange rate in terms of btc is going down. 
If the price is going down slowly but the market cap is going up, it's because new coins are being mined. 
Hope I answered your question!

Potentially, block size will never need to be increased. For now, with all plans being 100% adopted, we'd still need to increase the blocksize to become a full-fledged currency. There are about 1000 developers working on bitcoin today. Hopefully in 10 years that number is 100000 and we have multiple layer 2 solutions besides/on top of lighting that allow for never having a hard fork. We'll see.

honestly though, the market followed the "classic bubble" picture to the T and all the officials did was help it along a bit. 


hard to know exactly, but at least a few bucks


Again, you have no idea what you're saying. You might be repeating a talking point you heard somewhere else or you may have come up with this on your own, but you will not be able to link me to an article or plan that feasibly breaks down how a government would "adopt block chain with fiat."  there are so many things... the governement doesn't control monetary policy, the FED does.
Even beginning the discussion would be an extremely political event. Second, if the US (for example) were to try and apply blockchain tech to the currency, it would be a non starter. How do you deal with the counterfeit bills already in circulation aka How do you retroactively include all the monetary creation that has happened?  How do you deal with future monetary policy?   
Blockchain technology is the *antithesis* of central banking.  A controlling government will have a very hard time endorsing something that makes their current state of existence pretty irrelevant. You SERIOUSLY need to READ MORE if you think that it's as simple as "adopting the open source tech".


This would be in just one country though. Unless you think all the countries across the world can coordinate on something? and this would be just like weed, right? And then the internet comes out and people find out that it's actually not all that bad? Well... the internet is already out, bud. People can find things out for themselves. and they will. 


yo, bitcoin works. - adoption levels are high enough that even a world-wide governmental ban would not rid the world of crypto.  it's gonna happen so fast governments are gonna be like, "what?"


Cause I can't send gold over the internet?

Then you havent thought it through all the way.

To fill up blocks. If you spam transactions that won't be included because of low fee then you don't pay any fee at all, the transaction just fades away.  A theory being put forward is that miners, who are the ones receiving fees,  are the main ones spamming transactions.

Wow cool dude
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:59:25
 If it was simply a fork to 2mb and didn't include other code changes you could make this argument.  As it stands,  the 2x hard fork is not an upgrade, it's an attack. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:00:18
 Actions like making a selling your 2x on a futures market?
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:21:33

Crazy, right? Triple ledger accounting solves problems we didn't know existed.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:57:28
Core isn't "fucking us in the ass" with a 1mb block limit. The price is the highest it has ever been, even with the 2x attack.

He faked the trade. Professional faker here. Probably a teen that's good at internet.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:30:03
Ethereum is still a theoretical tech controlled by a centralized entity. Very different than BTC. Bitcoin exists now, and has no central figure able to control it.
 Just because some icos happened on ethereum and they have good marketing... it's  meaningless. The same icos happened on XCP, WAVES, etc.
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:42:35


Sounds like they already bought ��

deflationary spiral? Please see a response to that argument here: 
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:00:44
I'd argue we saw this from 2013-2016. Sentiment was very negative for 3 years and the price only went down.
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:20:56
using a centralized system, calling themselves blockchain, does not make it so.
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:40:17
It's clear that they did not...
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:02:28
It's clear now that you explain it. I just think that the article is full of shit and no survey was done. And if a survey was done it wasn't a random sampling of college students.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:17:46
Better seriously love yourself
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:19:33
Where? How? Where is there more information about this? The whitepaper is, again, the "currently anticipated" plans.
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:10:18
All you did was link an article about decrepit homes selling for $1-$1000 on an auction site. Do you have a link to show that high taxes is the cause? Genuinely asking, I did a cursory search but couldn't find anything.

So you work for a school? How else did student loans pay off your student loans?
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:32:52
Eventually. But for now they have the 12.5 btc block reward so they can basically say "fuck you" to everyone and include no transactions in the block.
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:33:15
You don't get any! Sorry! Start a huge exchange like BitFinex and then create your own Tether. That's where you get your free USDT.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:27:31
How is he regulating or planning? He is simply asking miners to be aware of their effect on the network.
@_date: 2016-09-30 21:40:13
If you read the post, he didn't get dumped on. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:36:15
How? Student loans are disbursed directly to the university. This is totally bullshit.

Antpool and F2Pool have been mining half-full blocks for a week. Keeping about 20MB in the backlog, which is half.

I have some bitcoins from the genesis block to sell you. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:35:29
Genisis block? Coins can't be moved from the genesis block.
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:01:42
Amazing. I'd love to run some TA by you later.
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:05:40
Yeah but who is buying the coins being created? You say it's the exchanges? Why would exchanges buy car wash tokens?
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:33:38
Because it's illegal... No one says I'm abusing coffee or caffeine even though I'm a son of a Bitch without those things. I don't have to smoke to be in a good mood, but I do need my coffee.

@_date: 2017-09-06 01:09:31
those are people buying the coins on the exchange. not the new coins being created. 
the point is, the coins are being created out of thin air, no one is buying them.

 Fees in the short-term, blocksize in the long-term
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:39:53
Most loans are disbursed directly to a school and not a student. So this a strange and archaic sampling of college students being asked about bitcoin that existed before bitcoin.

Take statistics in your high school bro
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:38:13
Although a few scholarships are paid directly to the student and Federal work-study money also goes to the student, most financial aid – both loans and grants – goes directly to the school and from there is assigned to your account. Tuition, college fees, on-campus housing, and meals are paid directly from this money.

You understand their marketing well. Thanks. What I'm saying is no one is actually buying those new tethers being generated out of thin air. They aren't backed up 1:1 because Tether doesn't even have a bank account to receive money into.
