If miners and business switch to btc1 client (as we can see, they plan to do this), the Core 0.15 clients will cut out from Bitcoin, cuz their become as minority chain. Because Bitcoin it is the longest chain according to Satoshi's whitepaper
So, nevermind. My question was, do i need run full btc1 client or SPV clients will follow for longest chain by default?

Satoshi said 1 mb is a temporary limit  




    maxblocksize = largerlimit




Also he said "The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale"  


So 1mb is not optimal size if we talk about Satoshi vision

s2x + sw with 2MB blocks is the same. So 1/2 - 2/3 vote for S2X ( in your scenario)

I think you not understand how Bitcoin work 




Only mining nodes can create blocks... 99% of users never will need run full wallet
Bitcoin is p2p money, cuz 3th party is decentralized block creators. No the single point of failure. Run full node and not mine, it's probably the most stupid thing what you can do here

Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it  


The CPU proof-of-worker proof-of-work vote must have the final say. The only way for everyone to stay on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, no matter what 


They (miners) vote with their CPU proof-of-worker, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism. 


Generally support. Support in Bitcoin is a market share, will it miners or business. The more your share, the higher your vote
