Looks interesting, any idea on what the price will be?

Formatted those links wrong by the look of it, always forget which way the parenthesis and the brackets go. Can't seem to edit it on my phone though.

I agree, there is always room for improvement. But I haven't found a chain that does them better, so they're still number 1 in my books.
They do double cook there fries by the way.

Their is no inherent value in anything, a commodity is only as valuable is its utility and/or perceived scarcity. Bitcoin, the network, has utility. While bitcoin, the cryptocurrency, is a finite in number.

Cool video. However I would like to know who it is and what they plan to do with the email addresses they collect.

Any way to browse the other users on there?

It's a step in the right direction. I don't like that it requires two devices, should be optional to use one or two. Should also monitor transactions and confirmations. Otherwise you would simply use the other device that you are monitoring with as your POS.

cointree.com.au is the best and cheapest exchange I've found in Australia so far. No fees to buy, and generally a pretty tight spread on the buy/sell price with a comparable rate to US exchanges.
Edit - replaced coinjar.com with cointree.com.au 
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:35:55
$30-$50 would be very cool. But even at $150 would be worth it.
@_date: 2014-07-17 02:05:54
Cheers, looks interesting.
Really should have looked around first. Someone asked the exact same question about 5 threads earlier.

Not buying at $80 when I first discovered Bitcoin.

 - have used several times with no issues. 0% to buy and trade bitcoin, 2% to cash out to fiat. No off chain transactions.

I was going to order a couple of issues a month back, and changed my mind when I saw the outrages international shipping charges.

Really excited about the Storj project, when will metadisk be available?
@_date: 2014-07-20 00:16:05
Why not have the entire offered capacity filled with some kind of filler code unique to each node and verifiable by the network, and have it over written with real data when it is actually used to store something? Thus to advertise 1TB, a node must cordon off a 1TB portion of its storage with otherwise useless code which is unique to it alone. Two distinct nodes cannot cordon off the same space as their filler code does not match.

Thanks for the feedback. I love the idea of Brawker, and will definitely use it to order some products online. But at this point, it seems that the risk of charge-back would make it to risky for paying any significant bills.

I dig it. Where can one download it?

Lord of the Fries is an Australian fast food franchise, they seriously make the best fries in the country. Looks like they are interested in accepting bitcoin (see the small article in their newsletter, the linked pdf), and have asked for feedback from potential bitcoin customers. I eat there all the time and would love to be able to buy with bitcoins, so I'm going to email them right now. If anyway else is keen on their fries, or just wants to help grow the bitcoin ecosystem here in Australia, shoot them through an email at info tweet them  or message them on facebook.

Cool quiz! 6/7
Re Q3, not sure I would consider transactions that have made it into a block the "latest" transactions.

Could be way off here, but I think what OP is getting at is a USB drive that out of the box devotes it storage to Storj's DriveShare and MetaDisk.

Cool merch, would love to be able to checkout without having to create an account.

Posting from my Q10 right now. Between the one bitcoin wallet in the app store and the ability to load android wallets, it has all my needs for a mobile wallet covered. Don't listen to the haters, in my opinion BB10 is the best mobile OS out there. Others don't even come close in terms of usability and out of the box functionality. Sure there are less versions of angry birds in the app store, and you'll have to use a third party instagram client. But that is a small price to pay for the efficiency built in to the rest of the OS.

Use this service all the time! Have paid hundreds of dollars worth of bills with it. Thanks a bunch for the great service guys.

Within hours? Why so slow?
@_date: 2014-04-17 14:03:51
Yeah no joke, they literally didn't go more than a couple of minutes without referring to Bitcoin in one way or another.

It is odd to me that no one seems concerned with the double tax issue in the current ATO guidelines.
What I mean by this is that merchants will be exposed to GST twice in any given transaction if they plan to accept bitcoin for a good or service and then convert to fiat currency. GST is applicable to the value of the initial transaction, but also to the conversion. So in order for the merchant to realize the same cash return as a cash transaction, they will have to pass on an extra 10% cost to the end consumer to cover the GST on conversion of bitcoin to fiat.

Cool idea

Thanks for providing a great service Daniel. Used it a bunch of times. Sorry to see it go, but will eagerly await the day that your service becomes viable again.

You mentioned USD, CAD, and EUR, how about Australian (AUD)? Have you shipped any too australia as of yet?

Sorry, meant to write 
I used to use coinjar, and have recently switch to contree. Like it a lot better.

Awesome, I'll put through an order later

My issue with this analogy is the narrow minded view of the benefits of Bitcoin. There are a myriad of benefits to Bitcoin outside of the potential to profit via speculative investment, most of which are equally beneficial whether you got into bitcoin in 2010 or yesterday. Principle among these is the ability for the otherwise unbanked to access a trust free and global payment network. Opening up the possibility of trade where it was otherwise impossible or cost prohibitive.
