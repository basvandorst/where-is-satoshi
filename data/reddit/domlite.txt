May I ask how bitcoin mining is operating at a loss exactly? I've never really looked into bitcoin before, mostly because it's a very tricky little currency, with fluctuating value and available in denominations down into a ridiculous number of decimals. However, just the other night I searched bitcoin mining, and was led to believe that one does this by essentially setting up/buying a bitcoin mining server. I was led to one that basically cost about $50, under the impression that it's basically "Switch on. Let it mine bitcoin. Done." and listed it as being capable of processing enough to net you an amount of bitcoin that totals roughly $72 dollars per month.
It's not exactly major income, but at a $50 hit *once* to make what is essentially a free $72 a month, that seems like it's an absolutely incredible amount of profit. If I did that and just let it accumulate for a year, I could afford to purchase one of the more expensive servers that can run even more calculations a month and mine even *more* bitcoin at no actual cost to my standard income and start bringing in a significant amount of money every month in bitcoin. Given, cashing it out is a different story, but if I can use it for a large selection of online purchases, then it's not exactly difficult to just use it for personal purchases, or purchasing something that I can then resell for cash.
All-in-all, I just don't understand how mining for bitcoin is a loss when currently a mining server can bring in more in one month than it cost to purchase it in the first place, unless the price literally fluctuates so violently that the price I looked up two days ago has reduced to less than a quarter of it's value.
