Inflation is when money loses value, like when you no longer need $1 for that pie you want to buy, but now it's $2. When there is no price increase in anything in the development cycle of that pie, the value of a dollar has gone down. (It's no longer worth a whole pie, only half a pie).
This is frightening for people with savings, as their money loses value, but this is beautiful for bitcoin investors, as the price should increase.

I honestly don't care anymore if this guy is the real Satoshi. I would like to thank Andreas to make this happen. You and everyone who donated are awesome!

Maybe a biometric authenication? Or a PIN code you type in, like you do now?

Can't ISPs block the protocol? Or something like that? Block the port that BitCoin is on?

Someone should create a fuzzer-service to be completely anonymous. The service provides you with an input address and you give an output address and it gives you other bitcoins instead. 
It would need some reserve bigger than the maximum transaction that would be done, let's say 50 bitcoins.
It would not have logins nor logs, it would just have a simple form where you could submit your address and the site would provide you an address. That address would not work after a set amount of time.
And of course there would be a small fee to ensure enough profit to keep the service afloat.

Can confirm. Our chocolate is pretty awesome.
Have you tried our beer?

Because you think you can modify the system so it sends all (or most) bitcoins to your addresses.

You're asking how viable bitcoin is?
Here are some answers:
 * Bitcoin is a protocol, it is not owned by anyone, it is simply developed and let loose on the world.
 * Bitcoin relies on a trustless network, which means that nobody is required to trust anyone else in this network.
 * All bitcoin transactions can be viewed on the [blockchain](
 * All bitcoin transactions are final, no refunds possible (unless there's a fork, but that's very rare)
 * You do not own X bitcoins, you own an address that everyone on the network agrees upon has X bitcoins
 * All bitcoin transactions from the past few minutes get put into what's called a "block" and it has a math problem attached to it, which when being solved by a "miner", gives (currently) 25 bitcoins. This is how bitcoins get generated.
 * When a block is found, the transactions contained in there are final unless another miner finds another block, in which case the clients agree to use the longest branch they receive.
 * Because these "forks" happen all the time and sometimes even span 2-3 blocks before the whole network decides on a longest chain, it is advised to wait 6 blocks before you are very very sure you got your money.
 * When you as a business want to be able to accept bitcoin as payment, the only thing you need is an app that makes QR-codes that contain a request of X bitcoins to your address.
 * Knowing that your clients could ask a refund months after payment from their credit card company, bitcoin is better at this, as it is usually instant.
More answers can be found on the [FAQ](

The only way to make QR codes work, is that there is a button on your homescreen that activates your camera for scanning QRs. 
Or it is built into the native camera app.

We need to pay them, that's how the system works. We cannot change that. But we can change who we pay by choosing other politicians and starting riots and petitions against the bad and corrupt.

YOU COULD SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT BITCOIN
@_date: 2014-04-18 23:44:06
We chose them. We pay them. aka They work for us. 
It is very simple. They don't make it seem that way, because thay'd lose their job if they did. But it's true.

Can confirm, didn't learn everything in school. Was simply told that our King was not very happy with black people and he did horrible things. We didn't get any numbers.

How would you go on doing this? I'm interested

Not an economist sorry, I don't know how the government suppresses interest rates.
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:42:52
bitcoin is sold and bought by people with vastly more money than you or me, to influence the price to their profit. As long as you don't play on the market and immediately transfer bitcoin to fiat (which I don't recommend) you don't need to worry.
I don't recommend selling right now, as it going down slowly is a sign of it rapidly going up in the future as you can see in the past.
In my personal opinion, bitcoin going down is just a very good opportunity to buy ;)

Yeah I like what the EU has done to protect the user, or keep their crimes hidden by giving us something.
But you guys in the US really need to get your politics straight, there's a few major issues.

You used to be a currency trader? What are your key points to look for when buying/selling?
@_date: 2014-09-04 11:56:51
The US government is holding back interest rates, as they say "to help the economy" (I think it's more to get more profit).
So when they stop holding back interest rates, you can use a metaphor, like he did.

He added 2.49 to 2.49 and cut off to a whole number.

Yup, make a dictionary of a few bits to words and send it as 'text', then decode it at the end. 
You just sent an encrypted PGP block as 'text'.

The only thing this will achieve is lower the encryption of day-to-day communication between good, nontechnical people.
Terrorists are probably already using fully encrypted e-mails and messages, and if they aren't, now they will.
This guy is an idiot.

Didn't even think about how they would enforce that, lol

Why do you mine in a pool? You have quite a lot of hashpower. I thought that it was only smart for people with a low hashrate to join a pool(to remove the luck factor), to avoid a pool getting over 51% when the big guys join(like you)?
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:54:15
Yes, obviously, but if nodes reject the transaction because it is a double-spend (which it is not, because it's the exact same transaction with just a higher fee), it more than likely will never reach a miner.
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:55:33
I am not describing a double-spend. It's verifiably not a double spend, because I am sending the same amount to the same address. I am simply including a higher fee.
Edit: I can see why people think this might be a double spend now. One could possibly own a large chunk of the bitcoin hashing power, and if transactions like this are automatically replaced by the one with the higher fee, one could put the entire transaction to be 100 BTC fee for a few satoshi transaction and hope that they mine the next block (or even ensure it by not broadcasting the transaction, but only mining it).
