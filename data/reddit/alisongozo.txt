Is there some threshold of activity that prompts id verification on lbc now?  I am a fairly active with a few deals a week where i sell 10k usd monthly.  Ive not gotten a request like this.
Who here has got asked for id?  And what type of user are you(small buyer, big seller, etc)

It seems attractive for businesses to move there but what about traders?  My research show 0%  gains taxes on btc trades but in slightly unclear as to whether its more advantageous for a citizen or for a non citizen legal resident (over 183 days).
Also unclear about the first in first out sell rules (ie if i bought a coin at 1000 in 2014 and a coin at 10000 in 2017 and sell 1 coin in 2018.
My husband is maltese citizen and i am american citizen but its easy to get dual citizenship if married to one.
Anybody know 100% for sure about what exactly is advantageous about malta for both businesses and individual traders?  
For those seeking a btc friendly country, malta (gozo in particular is absolutely gorgeous, safe and relaxed - malta is a lil more of a commercialized location in my opinion).  Its paradise during the summer season and i guarantee most people who visit wont want to leave during summer if your a hot weather lover.
Im trying to get confirmation on the trader rules as i am seriously considering a permanent move there with possible citizenship in near future.  Bitcoin has opened my eyes to the red tape-filled rat race that usa has become as it relates to making money.  Every turn you make, the govt has their hand in your pocket making it as hard as possible to get ahead.  I love usa dont got me wrong but as far as making money, some of the laws are truly disgusting so i certainly cannot love the govts stance on personal wealth.
