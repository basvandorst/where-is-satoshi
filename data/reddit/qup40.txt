This is why I own Bitcoin. I don't want to lose money via interest and I don't want to invest in overpriced stocks.

Loved this! Money as an idea is such an important concept. It is I think the biggest hurdle to adoption. In China they have a near cashless society which makes adoption easier and faster there than here.
For those who want more stuff like this about the idea of money I recommend listening to this episode of OTM who is generally negative on Bitcoin but still make good points about currency.

Why do you trust Gary Cohen Goldman Sachs and Trump who brags about dodging taxes over Bob Woodward who's lifes work is being trustworthy. This is why we need Bitcoin because people who are not trustworthy have too much power and somehow our solution is to give it to less trustworthy people. How are you siding with the big banks and Trump? Just how? We are pro Bitcoin here.

It's okay you are wrong he isn't changing history. Next time take a breath and let it go because being accurate didn't hurt you.

Wish I had seen this in 2013.... Would have been in a more comfortable position today.

I agree wholeheartedly with both of you. Without taxes our society collapses. Without taxes bombs and jails aren't made.

Stealing from the healthy to pay for the sick? Is this  /s?
This is the premise of insurance. The only difference is putting it in the social contract.
