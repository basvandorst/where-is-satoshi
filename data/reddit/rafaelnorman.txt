hi pikadrew,
i like what 37coins did by incorporating bitcoin wallet into SMS. I think it's genius and will make bitcoin more easy to use for many people.
I think what's missing is to incentivize the use of the wallet and also spreading the word.
The main idea is to marry the idea of bitcoin SMS wallet with multi level marketing. I'm thinking that since being the top node has a lot of advantages then a lot of people/merchants will want to be the early adopters (and will want to refer a lot of other people to be users). This will increase the number of users by a lot. Also in some countries, if you could use the bitcoin credits for prepaid cellphone load, that would be huge since people need cellphone credits daily.
Be sure to message me if you are going to do the idea :D

You dont have to use 123ABC... you could use whatever string you want...
And encrypting the keys  using software is safe and can't be cracked but is tedious to decrypt... and can't be done manually by yourself...
Thanks for the link. I'll check it out.

the difference is losing money vs losing photos which you just have to reupload

i think the bottom (if there is a bottom) is where its at right now... or even a bit higher (possibly the ATH that we are about to break)
@_date: 2017-01-02 07:27:14

sell 10% if you need to...
then next time sell 10% of the remaining 90%...
just an advice I heard around here that I thought made sense...
@_date: 2017-01-02 07:08:53
ok... thanks for your psychic demonstration of age-reading... and your flawless prediction of the future... "NO"

when you try to act like you know everything... you run into using betteridge's law when it doesn't apply...
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:52:17
