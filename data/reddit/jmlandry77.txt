The private conveyance of money with an infinitesimally small transmission fee.
Bitcoin can represent death to the corrupt fiat beast that has enslaved we serfs for eons.  
Bitcoin will be the granddaddy of cryptos and will always have value as log as it is technically sound.
That said, diversify your wealth!  Real estate, metals, cash, cryptos, stocks bonds.

Bitcoin is more than a cheap way to transmit money.  It is the PRIVATE conveyance of money that is it's greatest feature.  
No longer will we serfs be bound to a corrupt, fiat, monitored, taxed system.

I believe that we will see ups and downs.  My number is $300.

I hope so!

I'm trying to decide if I should double down.

Maybe the "why" is Baidu.  Or if Paypal jumped on that would be HUGE!

Explain it to me like I was 5!
Is it now 41% harder to mine?

If it really hit $500, you'd be a fool not to double down.
