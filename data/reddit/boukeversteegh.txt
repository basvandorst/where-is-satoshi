Bankruptcies remove unhealthy businesses out of the market, and forces other market players to improve and convince their customers that they won't fail too. MtGox's demise will make other exchanges better, and customers more demanding.
To not allow a bank or company to fail is to make sure that none of them will ever fix their problems. The possibility of bankruptcy or losing their customers is their sole motivation to be a good company.
I do think it is terrible for those customers who've lost money, but countless people here have repeated over and over again to not store your wealth on an exchange, and especially not MtGox. The people who were still in were willing to take a huge bet, and they may have lost in the end.
Any victims are victims of ignorance or blind trust in the corporate media, which has continued to lead people to MtGox for the past six months, despite obvious problems there and better alternatives.

There's a lot of information on  and I've basically read all of the linked material and used google / reddit to understand all kinds of attacks.
I suggest you take your time to understand the following concepts.
Prerequisite knowledge (use wikipedia):
- public/private key cryptography
- hashing, secure hashing (SHA256)
- digital signatures
- peer-to-peer networking
Bitcoin topics:
- bitcoin addresses
- transactions
- the blockchain
 - mining
 - difficulty
 - block reward
Even if you think you know what they are, they are not. It is quite complicated and it took me a big part of last year to understand the details and how it all works together, even with a technical background. Don't let it discourage you though; every time you understand a bit more you will be more fascinated by how ingeniously bitcoin was designed.
By the way, "alt-coins" are usually referring to alternatives to bitcoin (such as litecoin and dogecoin); not cryptocurrencies in general.

Governments are the opposite of a free market. The value of a currency is not freely determined by the market, because the government changes the supply of money to manipulate its value. People are not free to use another currency if they don't like the Fiat currency. Saying that government currency manipulation is "close to free market" to any degree is a contradiction in terms.

During the age of slavery, only a few percent of society opposed slavery on moral grounds. They were they ones who were seen as "disconnected, quarreling with society". Having world views different from the general public is not necessarily bad. Your suggestion to focus on the progress seems parallel to telling an abolitionist to focus on the great things that slavery has produced, rather than the evilness of it.
Progress cannot be made when people accept the status quo as 'good enough'. It must be made clear what its fallacies are and why it is immoral.
You cannot conclude what is moral based on what most people think is moral. As [Hume's law]( says, the "ought" cannot be derived from the "is". Again, the overwhelming majority of society accepted slavery as a moral way to run production. Now it's hard or impossible to find anyone to openly support slavery. So, what's society's "opinion" worth? Nothing. The fact that most people don't realize that violence is evil, and that governments can only operate through coercive violence, doesn't mean that it's not true, or that it is insane to point it out.
Rather, lets have truth be determined by reason and evidence, and not sentiment or popular voting.
Sure, I agree with you that society will feel uncomfortable with opinions that threaten their world view, and that society can't tell the difference between a terrorist with "different views" and a nonviolent hobby philosopher. The fact that society labels someone a heretic doesn't mean anything.

It doesn't take more time:


They also don't need to include more fake than actual transactions. If there is a natural variation in fees, than their inclusion of higher fees fake transactions will drag the median towards those naturally higher fees. The more transactions, the more the median is moved, yes, finally they can include 100% more transactions and completely control the median value. This doesn't have any particular negative consequences while block sizes still have some margin for growth.

Yes, but you are also able to update the ledger without anyone's permission. So it is publicly *readable* and *writable*.
So it is:
- public &amp;mdash; everyone can verify it without trusting anyone
- cheat-proof &amp;mdash; no-one can break the rules
- distributed &amp;mdash; everyone can modify the ledger, without permission
If I want to transfer money through a bank to another, I need the permission and cooperation of those two banks. If they refuse, I cannot transfer. In Bitcoin, the entire network of all miners would need to conspire to block your transaction.

How can someone promote the free market and be anti-capitalist at the same time? That's impossible.
Free market:
People have the right to use their property how they see fit. They can engage in voluntary trade and make money doing so. If two parties wish to trade or transact, the state doesn't forbid it.
Trade and industry is in the hands of private owners. The state doesn't interfere with or restrict trade by private owners.
These two concepts are pretty much the same.

It doesn't matter. The price was already up before i even completed my payment, and I sold immediately after i saw the transaction in my wallet, so it was practically 0 risk.

Going against the government's wishes 2014 style.
In 1923, Hitler stormed a government building with 2000 armed people, in an attempt to commit a coup d'etat. He failed and got sentenced to FIVE years in prison, eventually getting parole after 13 months.
Today, to commit such a crime in the US, you would definitely get 100+ years, but probably get assassinated secretly before it gets to that.

Thanks for your response. I will explain something about QE, which is massively inflating the money supply (one use of the word "inflation"), and is then given to financial institutions and banks. They are the ones who get all the money, and then use that money to invest in derivatives and mortgages. The banks hand out low interest mortgages which causes a massive increase in housing prices. Home prices are intentionally /not/ included in the inflation index, even though they account for the majority of people's spending, and they are the biggest factor in people's purchasing power.
- Take a look at [this chart](  
^(Click *National*. Also click the list-button for the numbers.)
You can see that the housing prices went up by **11.18%** in 12 months during the last year, in the US. This means that *actual inflation* (*price inflation*) should be 11.18%, instead the official single digits.
That's why you don't see general prices go up, because the money goes straight to the housing market, instead of to people's wallets.
There is a better alternative to stealing people's money: not stealing people's money, and putting an end to central banking. To give one institution the power over the economy of an entire country (and even affect the global economy) is bound to go wrong, as it has now, and in the 1930's. It is time to fix what caused these problems: market manipulation by government backed institutions and trying to centrally control the economy. We all know planned economies don't work (as in Communist Russia), because central planning doesn't work on this scale. Coercing people into particular behavior is not how to efficiently run a society; everyone spending their money on what they personally need and desire, and allowing people to create businesses to serve society's needs is the only feasible way. Let the free market rule, and stop interfering with peoples' lives. And the root problem of this system is that using force to control other people is evil, and governments are based on that evil method.
I'm drifting off here, but in any case, the FED will not and cannot "use" Bitcoin, because they don't control it. They cannot manipulate it. If the whole economy ran on Bitcoin, they couldn't control the economy anymore. That is their whole reason of existing.
I wonder which country you are from by the way. Is it perhaps Argentina?

"We need you to tell us to do what we think is right"
If they think that an exchange needs this, why don't they just build an exchange with these features? No need for government licenses and regulations. This just closes up the market from competition.
- Licenses applications take a long time to review
- Ensuring compliance adds huge costs to the legal department
- Time and money is wasted on compliance instead of actual security
- Companies should prove their security to the consumers, not to somebody who will approve the license
- If people want an insecure exchange and get lower fees, its their choice
- It creates a huge barrier for small start-ups who want to build a new exchange and add these security features later
- Less competition actually leads to less security and worse service

Double spending is the scenario where a transaction that a merchant has accepted does not end up in the blockchain.
How to do it:
- Create a transaction X from A to B (B is also your address)
- Keep the transaction hidden
- Start mining a block with this transaction in it
- Wait until you find the block, but keep it secret
- Create a transaction Q from A to C (C is merchant)
- Broadcast Q, so the merchant will think you paid
- Broadcast the block, before another block is found
- X is not in that block, and because coins at A are already spent by Q, X will be ignored.
- You have now received goods, and still have your bitcoin at address C.
Very hard to do in a face to face transaction, because you have to wait to find a block. A single miner will have to wait a really long time, maybe weeks to find one. A merchant is not going to sit around while you are suspiciously postponing your payment. It's more feasible to do online, like with gambling-sites where the payout is returned immediately after 0 confirmations.
- Connect to some nodes near the merchant
- Broadcast a transaction that the merchant will accept to nodes around him
- Broadcast another transaction to many many other nodes, which will conflict with the first one
- If a miner gets your second transaction first, that one will end up in the blockchain.
Still hard to do, because the merchant can prevent this by not allowing incoming connections, and connecting to many different far away nodes. Supposedly payment providers do this already (BitPay, Coinbase, Coinkite), so you can't fool a merchant who uses these providers.

This is called 'divisibility', not 'fungibility'. Fungibility is the property of money of one unit being indistinguishable for another. One Satoshi is as valuable as any other.
If you are asking 'is Bitcoin too divisible'? No of course not. It is like saying, 'meters are too divisible', because it would be impractical to say "I am 1795000 micrometer tall", or "I am 0.001795 kilometers tall".
You can use any unit that is practical for that situation. Houses would probably be expressed in bitcoins, while groceries can be expressed in milli-bitcoins.
If a name for smaller units is more convenient, then people will come up with a name. Such names have already been thought of, though not everyone agrees which name is more appropriate.
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:04:56
Well you weren't specific, so I can only guess. What exactly takes 60 seconds you say?
Waiting 60 seconds could decrease the chance of someone issuing a second conflicting transaction right after the first one, but you could also wait 30 seconds or 10 seconds or 2 minutes. It's completely arbitrary.
Waiting until you see the transaction on blockchain.info is one way to go.

What encryption are you talking about? There is no encryption in bitcoin. Encryption means encoding information in a way that can be decoded. Nothing in Bitcoin is encoded. It is either irreversibly hashed or publicly visible, perhaps except transaction signatures which can be decoded using the public key of the address owner (someone please correct me if I'm wrong on this).
Blocks are found by finding a partial collision of a double-hash of the block-data. Finding even a partial collision (a hash that starts with a bunch of zeros) is very difficult, and takes the entire combined bitcoin-network 10 minutes to find (by design). When we are nearing maximum difficulty (e.g. the whole network can find any full hash collision within 10 minutes) we need a stronger hash function or I guess a longer hash. When that happens, not only Bitcoin is in trouble, but any other computer security infrastructure that exists on planet earth, although I don't know exactly within what time frame this stage might be reached in the future.
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:43:16
Because on average, a block is found every 10 minutes, and this block confirms all users transactions at the same time.

How I understand (Naked) Short Selling (correct?):
- **Short Selling** is like renting a car for 3 days, selling it and buying it back before you have to return it. Hopefully you could buy it back cheaper.

Sorry to disagree. I've attended the conference, paid the 360euro ticket, and in my opinion it was well worth it. Great talks, inspiring conversations and interesting booths. One of them was Butterfly Labs, who had a working prototype of their new hardware wallet for demonstration. I was very impressed with it. I also confronted them with their current reputation and my skepticism, to which I got some insight that imo did clarify their failure to deliver the asics. Basically what he said is that BFL wasn't going to take preorders. They prepared production for about 5000 (I think?) units. Then the crowd went wild and started to beg them to put them on some kind of waiting list. They were offering money in advance even without any guarantee of delivery times. After such huge demands for preorders and people willing to pay up front no matter what, they decided to go through with it. Then they got like 50.000 preorders (or something, an order of magnitude larger than planned), and they ran into trouble to fulfill the orders. I don't know why they didn't stop taking orders when things got out of hand, but I also don't know how quick those pre-orders were placed. Another thing I hadn't heard before is that apparently they didn't need the pre-orders for the development of the hardware. They were a successful chip-company and had used their profits for the development of their first asics. So the idea that they intentionally allowed pre-orders, to fund their r&amp;d for a product that wasn't finished, seems false.
I don't know if these answers make sense, but to me I felt these guys were honest and just messed up big time by taking pre-orders and allowing people to pay up front. He told me they will never ever take pre-orders again, because it's just a hell.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:11:54
Technically, you wouldn't need a screen if the hardware wallet could output a signed message back to the computer (through filesystem or some other way).
If you have a way to independently verify that the message came from the hardware wallet, it could securely communicate to the user which transaction request it has received, so the user knows 100% sure that when they confirm the transaction, that it is not a different one.
The wallet would need to come with a public key, and have an internal private key for signing. The problem is obviously that you need another reliable device to verify the authenticity of the message.

Bitcoin is basically a protocol to achieve consensus within a group of nodes. Consensus means that they must be able to communicate.
Basically, if two people on an island wanted to transact, they are using the rest of the Bitcoin network as a trusted third-party. The third party "Bitcoin" is however not a single organization but a collection of independent nodes.
If you want to use a trusted third party, you necessarily need to communicate with them.
If two groups of nodes can't interact with each other, then no consensus can be reached between them, but this is also not necessary, because to double spend you also need to connect to both node groups.
An individual node can try to double spend their coins on both separate groups of nodes, but in that case you are suggesting that none of the nodes between the two groups have any way to communicate, except for the individuals who wish to double spend. As soon as a single honest node relays information to the other side, the groups are connected, and the double spends can be prevented or reversed.
The network indivisibility I think could be called a "connected set" or "connected graph". However, the fact that it is usually connected, doesn't mean that all nodes are always connected, and that the Bitcoin network can't be split. Splits may and probably will happen.
There cannot exist a protocol that allows for network splits (disconnected graphs), and still be able to reach a consensus between these components (disconnected groups), because consensus means that the nodes agree, and you can't agree on anything if you can't communicate what to agree on.

Basically, the block-interval was chosen to be 10 minutes, so that in most cases a newly minted block would have time to spread through the network before the next block is found. If not, miners aren't working on the same block, and there will often be competing chains, causing blocks to be orphaned and letting work go to waste.

People are suggesting that sending dust to people makes it easier to link ownership of multiple addresses. I don't see how.
If dust was sent to address A, and later Bob consolidates A and his other address B, then yes, it becomes public that Bob owns A and B.
However, if A already had &gt;0 balance, consolidation would happen at some point anyway. The dust doesn't make it more likely.
Perhaps address A was actually empty, so Bob wouldn't (couldn't) consolidate unless dust was sent to it. Then what is the point of proving that Bob owns an empty address?
There would only be a point, if that address is still being used, except it was only empty when the dust was sent to it. Then the spammer can prove that Bob controls an empty address that he might use later.
However, the dust was sent to many addresses that weren't empty at all. This doesn't help at all to link address ownership.
My conclusion is that the purpose of this spam wasn't to link ownership or create transaction graphs.

The bitcoin network's hashrate is increasing exponentially, and the difficulty can go up 100% in a matter of weeks. If the equipment doesn't pay for itself within a few weeks or months, then it never will. It is very hard to predict what the future difficulty will be, and how profitable equipment is going to be.
In other words, mining is far more risky than selling equipment. It makes sense as a manufacturer to take guaranteed lower profits than very uncertain high profits.

Don't you realize how dangerous your perception is? "People shouldn't be allowed to do X if they may suck at doing X". Why do people reject this proposition in every part of their personal lives, but accept it when it only concerns others?
Should the government forbid you to marry the woman you love, if they think you'd be a bad husband and she'd suffer from you? At least with some marriage license women would have a minimum level of security that there husbands are nice.... Right......? We would never accept that the government made these kinds of choices for us.
Perhaps you shouldn't be allowed to post comments on the internet because you may not be good at that? How ridiculous such a rule would be.

In the US almost no-one get's a hearing by a jury.
[**Plea bargaining**]( in the United States is very common; the vast majority of criminal cases in the United States are settled by plea bargain rather than by a jury trial. They have also been increasing in frequency—they rose from 84% of federal cases in 1984 to 94% by 2001. Plea bargains are subject to the approval of the court, and different States and jurisdictions have different rules.

When I called central bankers evil bastards, I assumed that they were evil because they inflate the money supply, which is equal to theft, which is evil. I'm open to debate whether inflation is theft, or whether theft is evil, but there is a more interesting question, which I think is the core of the discussion:


I just spent 3 hours debating this question with a friend, and it is a tricky question. Two factors seem most important:
- Do they understand that their actions are evil?
- Do they have a choice in committing their actions?
In cases where people do not realize that their actions are evil, according to objective moral standards, society's or their own standards, they cannot be morally responsible for committing evil. If you didn't know that God killed a kitten, every time you masturbate, you are not evil for masturbating. If you honestly think that you are doing people a favor by manipulating the economy, and do not realize that you are stealing from people's pockets, you cannot be morally accountable, and are therefor not necessarily evil. Of course you are fully responsible if you are intentionally ignorant about the possible evilness of your deeds.
I do have evidence that at least one central banker is aware of the great harm that central banking brings onto society and the world: [Bernanke admits FED caused Great Depression]( admits fed caused great depression), long before he was the president of the FED back in 2008.
The second question is whether he had a choice or not. I assume that Bernanke was not forced into his role as central banker, and that he would have the possibility to step down, and at least to implement a different kind of plan instead of massive inflation and putting the financial industry on monetary steroids. Since it logically and economically doesn't make sense to assume that Central Bankers are forced to commit evil, I think the burden of proof lies with the other.
At least the case of Ben Bernanke, it is clear to me that he is evil. I don't have evidence against all Central Bankers so - to be fair - calling all of them "evil" is a generalization. I will proceed to call the actions of central bankers and their institution evil, rather than calling them evil as persons. Their actions are certainly evil, and it is those actions I want to argue against, not their personalities. Thank you for your feedback.

Actually, you don't understand. Nothing in Bitcoin takes "60 seconds". Every confirmation takes 10 minutes on average, and historically people said that 6 confirmations makes a double-spend attack extremely unlikely. Now people generally don't mind the number of confirmations, as it turns out Bitcoin transactions are very reliable even without confirmations or after just one.
As noted by others, for large amounts where speed is not an issue, waiting a few confirmations gives you 100% certainty.

"Economy" happens when two parties voluntarily exchange goods or services because they believe the transaction will leave them better off. Wealth is subjective, but the more people can freely transact with one another, the more that subjective wealth will increase. If your goal is to increase the wealth of all people in society, then you should want as little interference in economic activity as possible. Anytime the government creates economic policy, it is restricting people's ability to make voluntary transactions (minimum wage, licenses, zoning rules, trade restrictions, tariffs). Any interference will limit the growth of the economy.
Inflation and government "boosting the economy", a euphemism that means that people are forced to invest in companies they have no interest in, are inherently evil because it takes away money from people without their permission. I say it is bad for the economy because it distorts the market and the pricing mechanism. The housing booms cause people to massively get mortgages, and causes companies to start building more houses, which create jobs for construction companies and some economic growth. However, the question is: *at what cost*? People's purchasing power is cut by 11%, to create an artificial market which collapses later anyway, gives some people jobs for a short time and makes banks and construction companies very rich. People normally spend money on what they want or need, and prices rise when demand for something rises, which incentivize businesses to sell goods and services that people need. Due to inflation and interference in the market, this pricing mechanism is distorted, and businesses deliver goods that people don't really want (like too many houses), at least not for their actual price.
Another problem with inflation is that it encourages people to spend now, rather than save for the future. Saving money (collecting capital) is the key feature of economic growth. To start a business or create something new, people need investments, and when societies are forced to spend their money, there is little money for investments, and few new businesses will be created, meaning no new jobs, no new products and no increased welfare.


Did you mean to say that "the US is a perfect example of free market education and health not working"? Or do you mean the opposite? I honestly don't know which you mean so please clarify, before I write a long argument against the wrong opening statement.


Of course people need security, but it doesn't have to be a single company that is enforced on everyone (police). What people need and are willing to pay for, the market will provide.

too bad regulation doesn't even work. the financial industry is full of crooks. it will only hinder competition to existing exchanges who have the time and money to lobby licenses. Once they and their peers get a license, they can enjoy very little competition, leading to less secure exchanges and less innovation, even when people demand more transparency for example.
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:54:33
- People don't think for themselves because the government thinks for them. Regulation is making the problem worse.
- Making wise decisions should be rewarded, and bad decisions punished. This is why Gox should not be bailed out, so exchanges know that no-one will cover for them, and so consumers know that they have to do a bit of research.
- Consumers will learn that they should consult an expert before making difficult decisions.
- Regulation isn't the only way. Ebay isn't regulated either. A review system makes sure people know where to buy. If the marked is in need of quality information on exchange reliability, then the market will provide this. If the consumer doesn't care about possibly losing money, then they don't want your regulation either. Isn't government supposed to reflect the will of the people? Not "Let me tell you what you want, and force it upon you"
- Socializing risk leads to irresponsible behavior.
- People don't always make right decisions. That's why I don't want other people making decisions for ME. If I know exactly which exchange to use, why should I pay for the ignorance of other users?
- Regulation is enforced through involuntary taxation. Regulation makes running business more expensive at the cost of all consumers.
- Those who make the regulations don't know shit about Bitcoin. They are bound to create ridiculous regulations.
- The difference between Erik's call to brotherhood and the government taking your money, is that one is voluntary while the other is enforced using violence and punishment.

a more accurate way to describe it is: bitcoin demand is decreasing, which means:
the aggregate number of bitcoins that people are willing to buy for any price bracket is decreasing. so when the number of bitcoins for sale within a price bracket doesn't change, there will be a surplus of bitcoins in that bracket, and to sell, sellers have to lower their price.

yes there is, but it requires that all bitcoin software agrees on what the limit is, otherwise there would be several incompatible versions of bitcoin. it is a hot debate whether increasing the blocksize or not, and by how much and when is going to make bitcoin more centralized or decentralized, whether it is in the spirit of the original whitepaper, and generally whether it will help make bitcoin become a useful currency alternative to millions of people.

As far as how I understand it: it's not really a passphrase, rather it uses a very large dictionary of english words to encode the private key.
The problem with brainwallets with simple passphrases is that you use a low-entropy key to generate a private key which is supposed to have high-entropy. I think blockchain generates a random key, then encodes it in another way that is easier to remember or write down.
It's hard to remember the 0's and 1's of the key, so you could use Hex (0123456789ABCDEF) or Ascii-58; or use English words.

I think most people here will recognize that there will be a market correction (aka. crash) soon, but the problem is no-one knows when, at what price level, and how much it will fall. The price may go up slowly till 500 and then crash back to 300, or go till 700 and crash till 500. I don't know.

Unprofitable mining investments will lead miners to hold onto their coins and sell them when price can at least partially pay back their investment; which means less coins will be available on the market, driving the price upward. Some investments will turn out to be complete losses, as the machines bought during the hype can only generate a negligible amount of BTC.  Those miners might switch to altcoins. I'm not sure how that would decrease bitcoin price, or increase altcoin price. Please explain.

Limited supply and store of value are different aspects of sound money, but they are different. Limited supply is a necessary, but not sufficient requirement for something to be a store of value. For a commodity to be used as a store of value, it also needs continuous and stable demand (desirability). To be money, it needs many more things.
There is a limited supply of certain deceases, but they are not desirable and therefor not useful as a store of value or money. Umbrellas are limited and desirable, but only during times of rain. It is therefor unsuitable as a store of value. Bread would be better, because it is desired throughout the year, but unfortunately it is not durable (quickly loses value over time). A pair of ordinary jeans of average size would probably make a good store of value (if you don't wear it); desired at any time, and they have been worn for 40 years without much change in appearance. However, they make bad form of money. They aren't divisible (so you can pay arbitrary amounts), fungible (so each pair of jeans is worth the same), nor transportable (what if you'd want to buy a car, paying with jeans).
The point for using something as a store of value is that you would like to rely on proven desirability over a long period of time. There aren't many goods that have it. Gold and silver are really rare exceptions in this regard, and that's why they're considered good stores of value. They have been desired for thousands of years and in practically any culture on earth. Bitcoins just came about, and time will tell whether they will remain desirable. I believe they will, and that they will be more and more so, but it is an unproven assumption. Hope this helps.

What the hell? Why would you ask back what you gave to someone? Even if you regret giving it, you have no right to ask it back. The only reason you regret it is because now it's worth more than then. You should not regret giving 1btc and ask it back, and for these reasons:
- you helped spread the word about bitcoin. because you and others did that, we are where we are now. the price increase is also a consequence of that
- it costed you a couple of cents to give him hundreds of bucks. you should be happy about it.
- it's a friend, you should be glad to have done it. i actually regret not giving more btc to my friends. i bought a bit for my family last spring, but i wish i had given all of my friends some bitcoin. they would be so thrilled right now.

You bought Bitcoin with borrowed money? What if it drops. Sorry to say, and as much of a promoter of Bitcoin I am, I don't think it is wise to invest money you don't have into a volatile asset. Although I think you will probably get a profit from it in the long run; you did buy at an All Time High. I won't be surprised if value drops 10% suddenly.
To all newcomers, invest as much as you are willing to lose. If OP is willing to lose a portion of that investment, then I don't have any problem with it. I was tempted to go negative on my bank account to invest in Bitcoin, but I decided not to do it. If value goes down, I'm stuck paying interest, or I need to sell some of my other Bitcoin.
Don't spend money you don't have. If Bitcoin is the solution to the financial collapse, at least we should be wiser than those who've caused the collapse by ignoring this simple principle.

From what I've read, it will not be trivial to increase the cap to more than eight places, as this basically forks the blockchain. The majority of clients and miners need to  upgrade to support the new number of decimals, otherwise the new fork won't take over the old one. Clients who don't upgrade will keep using the old chain and make transactions that will eventually be undone when they finally do switch-over.
I'm not entirely sure if this really a problem or not, but perhaps someone else can clarify this..

If this solution would work why even bother encrypting a wallet and storing it? Just use the private keys to the bitcoin addresses which are uncrackable. The public bitcoin addresses can be derived from that, so you don't even need to save those addresses.

Your Bitcoin balance is stored on addresses to which you have the private key. A wallet application creates addresses and remembers the private keys for you. If you lose the private keys, then no-one can ever transfer money from those addresses to another. Meaning that the coins are unspendable, and "lost forever".
A simple way to prevent this scenario is by making backups from the wallet application whenever you add a new address or send money (because most clients create a new address to receive change). Some clients support password-protected backups, which you can safely email to yourself or store in the cloud. Of course the password should be very difficult (a long phrase is the safest way, or lets say 10 random words).

First of all, you can encrypt your wallet with a strong password, or use a long passphrase with for example brainwallet. In that way, the only way to lose control of your coins is if you are forced to give up your password/passphrase.
Secondly, the address to hold the bitcoin can be kept secret. If coins were sent to it in a way that's untraceable to you (ie, mixer service or coins paid for with cash), and if it can't be proven that you're the owner (because you didn't tell anyone you own it, and you don't keep records of it on your computer, nor are you constantly checking its value online), no-one can know how much bitcoin you have. If you are tortured you can always give the passphrase to an address with few bitcoin on it.
Practically speaking, if it were to become illegal, I don't think the state could do much to take your money from you.

It is actually possible to get a rough estimate, or at least an upper bound on the number of lost bitcoins. Because all addresses and transactions are public, you could scan the blockchain for addresses that haven't been used for over a year. Those could be 'lost bitcoins', although can't be sure of it. Sort of how you would measure "active users" on a social networking site.

The "price" is merely the price at which the last transaction happened. If you want to buy 100 BTC, but only 50BTC are offered at $220, then you need to pay more to get more BTC. The next 10 BTC might be 221, and the next few after it 222. Eventually, you buy your 50th BTC for $223, and thus the price of the last transaction is $223. This is pretty much deterministic as it happens automatically and instantly on exchanges. If you place a buy order of 2000BTC for $250 max, you can calculate where the price will go

Nobody owns the Bitcoin system, that's the beautiful thing about it. Technically speaking, Bitcoin is only a protocol. The protocol are the rules that decide how Bitcoin can be created, and how they can be transfered. The protocol includes mechanisms that make sure that no-one can cheat the rules. Everyone can verify that the others are following the rules, and if they aren't, they are simply ignored. This allows Bitcoin to operate without a central authority.
Bitcoin.org is owned by the Bitcoin Association, which is a non-profit organization dedicated to making Bitcoin popular. They have no control over how Bitcoin works, and no power over the protocol whatsoever.

Bitcoin has had enormous exposure the last two days on reddit; it's a trending topic on google in canada and the US i think, and someone posted a graph today showing wikipedia views of the bitcoin page that was like hundreds of times higher today than all the weeks before it. I'm expecting a lot of newcomers going into bitcoin, which should drive up the price. Unfortunately I do expect that it will be rush, so that the price will go up above its "real value".. I'm buying tho

You're welcome :) The help page will tell you how to access your online wallet. Once you are logged in, you can send bitcoin to any address you like. You could also download a mobile wallet (mycelium for android, or blockchain for iphone), and send it to that address so you have it with you. You could install a bitcoin client on your computer (e.g. multibit), generate an address and send it to your computer.

People who downvoted above post clearly don't understand encryption.
Yes, bitcoin is perfectly safe and noone can practically extract your private key from your bitcoin address. But if that private key is stored in a file, and the file itself is only encrypted with a short password, or a weak type of encryption is used, then this is much easier to crack. To have the same level of security as bitcoin, it must indeed be AES256 encrypted with a password that is as long as a bitcoin private key (I think around 50 random chars).
The question becomes then, how to remember that password? If you are going to write it down somewhere, then just forget about encryption, and just write down the private key of a single address, and store all your bitcoin there.
The only thing the coin provides you is secrecy. The fact that people are not likely to figure out that you have a private key hidden in a coin. If there's really a million $ on that wallet, encrypting it really doesn't help, because now you have to keep _that_ key secret somehow. Unless you don't use a random key, but a really long passphrase that you can remember. &lt;--- solution found!

The difference is that with (opensource) software, you download the program once, and it will be the same program from then on (except for autoupdates).
With webapplications, the program is downloaded (into memory) every time you open it, so its behaviour could be different. For example, the computer that serves the application gets hacked, and the hacker changes the encryption part of the code to not encrypt at all. The hacker can then read all messages passing through the server. With downloaded software this couldn't happen, because you have the software on your harddisk, so as long as you yourself don't get hacked, you're safe. Except when there is an auto-update function, or the software is not opensource so you don't even have any guarantee that the software does what it claims to be doing.
Now my point is, that using a browser-extension, you're doing downloading the code once and you can trust that it won't change, so a server hack can never expose your messages since they are encrypted client side.

1. I deposited money to bitstamp a week ago (from Europe, using SEPA), it took only 1 day.
2. Of course. That's the whole point of buying Bitcoin. You can send them to any address in the world; including other addresses that you own.
3. You mean fiat? As soon as the order is completed and visible in your account, you can initiate a withdrawal request.
4. From mt. Gox, it will take more than a month. They have serious liquidity problems. From Bitstamp, it will probably take a few days at most, although I haven't tried it yet (just made a withdrawal today).
5. Nope. Paypal doesn't accept businesses operating with Bitcoin.

I guess it depends on your culture. Where I live (the Netherlands) a present is supposed to be something thoughtful; something that took a bit of effort to choose and is something that the recipient specifically likes.
Money is just a lazy way to give a gift, because it doesn't take any  effort, so some people see it as an insult or feel it's inappropriate to give money, even when they were asked for money instead of gifts.

That's the miner's fallacy, to rely on rising rates for profit or even get ROI. If you're expecting a big raise in price, just buy coins instead of hardware.

Yes, so he still had to pay for those two gpu's. You can only mine so many coins with one card, because after a few months the difficulty is so high that you gain practically zero. The question is whether you can mine enough to get any ROI. And to test that you should use the market rate at time of hardware purchase, and not take into account future higher rates; otherwise you should've bought coins.
Now the thing is he is mining scrypt coin, I don't know how fast difficulty increases there, but the above applies to BTC at least.

If a bug was found that allowed someone to steal your money (if that's what you mean by "cracking the bitcoin code", then there would be a patch and a new version of the bitcoin protocol. Anyone with bitcoin would desperately want to switch to the other bitcoin version. Basically people who don't switch can keep using their old version, but it will become two separate systems (blockchains) and their payments won't be accepted by the other clients. It's easy to see how all Bitcoin owners would abandon the old version instantly, because they don't want to lose their coins.
The hard thing would be how the developers could deal with legitimate transactions that happened after the exploit was discovered, and how the patch would not undo those transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:15:02
I'm sure the payment would happen using bitcoin. Obviously with current volatility it still makes sense to denominate prices in fiat, because it is more stable. It doesn't mean they don't use bitcoin to pay.
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:24:26
I suggest registering and verifying an account on Bitstamp. Put some bitcoin on it, sell it, then transfer the money to your bank. But obviously your bank is going to ask questions if you deposit more than a couple of thousand euros. I would definitely NOT put that money in the hands of anyone but myself.
Sell a few thousand, like, i dunno, 2000, put it on your bank. Buy a small vault; create a paper wallet, transfer all the money to that wallet using blockchains anonymous send function, and keep the paper in the vault forever. Don't tell anyone how much you have. If they ask what's in the vault, just tell them its a 1000 euro bar of gold or whatever.

It certainly adds to the deflation, but Bitcoin is deflationary by design, even if of people didn't lose access to their addresses. This is caused by the inability to counterfeit Bitcoin (i.e. create bitcoins on demand).

1. You can use a wallet at Coinbase, and install the coinbase app. It syncs nicely. You could also export the private keys, and import them into your android; however that will not automatically sync new addresses that your different clients might create.
2. I don't know sorry. I use multibit. Your connection should be good enough; although it might take a long time to download initially. Actually, keeping it open would stress your bandwidth less, because it just downloads a piece every 10 minutes. The other data is might forward is not much.
3. It won't be too high. Also; you can use a lightweight client such as the one on your tablet; it hardly uses bandwidth (although it does eat battery if you don't Disconnect).
4. n/a. I'm in Europe.

If very few people keep mining, difficulty will crash and block discovery-rate goes back to 1 per 10 minutes. It won't take any longer to process a transaction. Furthermore, the block-reward will be shared by fewer people which increases incentives to mine.

I used option 3 from the help page to convert it into a webwallet. You can then use blockchain.info to manage it.
You can have wallets anywhere you like. Online, on your computer, on your phone. A wallet is the software or website that manages your money. Basically, it keeps the private keys (access codes) to your addresses for you. Obviously, if you have a wallet on one site, you can't use another site to withdraw money from it. But you can easily send bitcoin from one wallet to the other. Hope this helps.

It would need to be emptied every now and then; then deposited into a bank account, and then transfered to an exchange via bank wire or some other method. Unless people buy as much as they sell, then they can just keep the money in the machine to pay people who want to sell their bitcoins.

Bitcoin doesn't need to be backed by a scarce commodity, because it IS a scarce commodity. Only fiat money which could be printed at will should be backed by something, so it doesn't lose its value. Bitcoin is deflationary by design, so it doesn't need backing.
The argument is about whether bitcoins have value as a commodity (i.e. intrinsic value). I say no they don't, but Bitcoin as a payment network does have intrinsic value, because it is so useful.

To the one who sold the bitcoin. That person probably bought it from someone else, etc, who bought it from a miner who made the bitcoin. The miner gets the money, and probably uses it to recover the cost of his mining equipment, electricity, air conditioning and maintenance, and of course to pay him profit.

To summarize the article; according to my understanding of it:
- An evil Pool that finds a block keeps it secret, and starts working on the next bock
- The pool publishes their block immediately when another finds a block, and by surrounding other miners with "fake" miners who only propagate the pool's block, rather than the 'other' block, the pools block will be chosen.
- They already have a head start on the secret block, so it will be easier for them to find the next one.
- Once they get 2 blocks ahead of the public chain, they will keep publishing only the previous block, and not the latest one so they will keep their edge.
- If the pool gets ahead by X blocks, they can keep X-1 blocks secret, and have an ever bigger advantage.
- The pool keeps 'undoing' work made by other miners by publishing a slightly longer chain, and will push them out of business.
- The pool gets the reward for every single block
edit: added last point.

Actually I'd like to give you better advice. You don't know what commodities or currencies will crash. If you want to reduce your risk, don't put all your value into one. Spread the risk. Keep some dollars, keep some bitcoin, keep some gold, keep some stocks, land. etc. If one crashes, one or more others will probably go up.
