Yes, basically.  The end result is the CHF is worth more, as we can see in the markets.  Since keeping the peg meant selling CHF and buying mostly EUR, they also supported the EUR (and kept the value of their EUR reserves higher).  Now that they officially ended the peg, all those EUR are now worth less.  So if the SNB had printed CHF and simply kept them, then if you ignore the second- and third-order effects of the policies, the value of their holdings would be higher than they are now.
It's evaluating the effect of the second- and third-order effects that is really tricky, and why it's hard to say this was a bad move, even if the SNB 'lost' money with the policy change.
IMO the policy change was coming, whether they liked it or not (with ECB imminently about to start QE).  Keeping the policy would have meant losing even more eventually.
A central bank is not a hedge fund.  Their goal is not to make money on FOREX--it's, among other things, to support and protect the economy of the nation.  The peg was a very good thing for the Swiss economy; if they could have kept it they probably would have.  They re-evaluated the equities, though, and decided it was better to stop holding the floor.  C'est la vie.

Switzerland has multiple official languages, among them French and German.
Swiss National Bank -- SNB (English)
Schweizerische Nationalbank -- SNB (German)
Banque National Suisse -- BNS (French)
Either way is correct.
