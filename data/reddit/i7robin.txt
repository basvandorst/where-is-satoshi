There is something being developed called RGB which is essentially colored coins on LN. This would be a huge deal. There are many applications for colored coins, see Bisq's BSQ. Using colored coins on the base layer is very expensive so a lot of the usecases don't make financial sense. When the cost of making a new token is simply the channel opening tx we could see whole stocks being issued on LN. If i'm not mistaken RGB allows you to have a colored coin on one end and route it through normal "un-colored" channels to be colored again one reception at the final destination. There should be some really mind blowing stuff like fee-less non custodial stock markets given the technology works as promised.

How do you make it so it's not just posts about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-03-13 18:37:23
Excellent video. So, kinda a Lightning noob here. He is not running a lightning node from his phone because a lightning node requires a bitcoin full node, he is simply sending a request to make a payment to his LN node, correct? So in order to have a lightning node you have to be running a full node? How are everyday users going to get over the need to run a lightning node? Will there be LN as a service subscriptions?

The short answer is many people who own bitcoin only care about making a profit, freedom is an after thought. These people overlap heavily with those complaining about market manipulation.

Yes of course, I'm by no means saying it is easy and everyone has an equal outcome of mining a block. The difficulty of mining is what ensure the network is secure. My point is that there is no way to gatekeep entrance into the network, from within the network itself. 
Also if i'm being extremely literal, you CAN just run software and have a chance of finding a block, the odds are extremely low that you find a block but there isn't anything keeping you from trying.

Ok what happens if you get sent dust on lightning? Is that a problem?

I've seen people offering to buy or sell bitcoin on craigslist in my area? It seems to be a lot riskier without the escrow step that LocalBitcoins offers. 
Regardless there are options.
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:16:17
Quantify? probably not. I think the goal should be so people can run full nodes on their phones, which would make lightning adoption much more feasible. I believe this possible in the next five years with terabyte sd cards becoming cheaper and with 5g coming online in the next couple years.

LN potentially poses a huge risk to Bitcoin. Why ever push the transactions back to the mainchain if there is no counterparty risk? If no one is using the mainchain why mine? Since the block reward will be cut in half till there is no block reward who will pay miners if no one is transacting on the mainchain? The fees will either shoot through the roof or people will propose a higher inflation rate. It's important that people think about Bitcoin ownership as owning keys that can spend coins not owning keys that can spend transactions once those transactions are broadcast to the network. That way of thinking poses huge risks to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

You guys are arguing about 2 different definitions.  is saying there is no risk of people "defaulting" like on loans and bringing the price of your real estate down for example.  is saying there are things that can happen to Bitcoin that could make you lose money, like an inflation bug that goes unnoticed or someone breaking the cryptography. Both are true.

Yeah no I get that but that isn't the same as saying BTC = LN. Lighting is obviously something different than Bitcoin. You seem to be focused on Bitcoin the currency and not Bitcoin the consensus mechanism. Yes I 100% agree that Bitcoin transactions on ln are the same as they are on th mainchain. What I believe we disagree on is what it means to truly own your coins. Owning bitcoins (to me) means that a private key that you have in your possession meets the requirements of a tx that has been mined and validated by all nodes in the network. There then has to be at least 3 blocks mined and validated on top of the block with my utxo. Unless all of those conditions are met I do not believe you can say you "own" bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:53:06
No lightning doesn't move Bitcoin. Bitcoins are only moved on the mainchain. Lighting moves Bitcoin transactions not Bitcoin. The transaction has the equivalent value to you because you believe that you can give the transactions to a node secure the funds.
@_date: 2019-06-03 16:05:24
I understand your point. You don't need to claim your cash to spend it. I never made that argument. The argument I'm making is that by making an "IOU" for btc you can spend them faster and at high frequencies. Just like like paper money in place of gold.
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:26:39
OP never claimed Bitcoin ownership was without risks. They simply claimed there is no risk of default like traditional markets, and no counterparty risks. But absolutely everyone should be aware of the technical and consensus risk involved and should actively work to mitigate those risks, aka run a node and audit the code if technically capable.
@_date: 2019-06-03 16:16:08
But what about litecoin lightning tx's?
@_date: 2019-06-03 14:54:18
To me LN is the invention of paper bank notes while everyone was using gold. Like when I open up a bank account and put gold in it that gold never moves I simply give someone a note that when submitted at the bank grants them the gold in the vault. People realized that these notes were easier and cheaper to transact with. 
This is essentially what LN facilitates, a way to write an IOU ontop of Bitcoin and to trust that at any point you can go to the basechain(bank) and get your coins(gold). I see nothing wrong with this way of thinking and I believe it to be healthy for the space.
@_date: 2019-12-23 18:03:38
Every person that validates their own transactions decentralizes the network. So, you are correct. Having more than one node per entity is useless.
However, 


Is quite far from the truth. Each entity that uses bitcoin is making a value judgement by selecting the "right chain" the only way someone can make this selection (implicitly voting for the consensus algorithm) is by validating the history of transactions themselves according to the consensus rules they follow. It's the aggregation of all bitcoin users deciding for themselves what bitcoin is that ultimately helps the miners decide which consensus rules to follow.

I'm not going to try to prove a negative but I might be able to speak to some interesting points about PoW while simultaneously meeting your challenge. 
As of right now the big alternative to PoW is PoS. I will speak to what i see as flaws in what is widely accepted as the next most plausible form of securing a distributed ledger, PoS, rather than pit PoW up against some hypothetical yet to be discovered protocol.  
In a proof of stake system a user has to already posses a stake in the network to have the privilege of being able to earn a reward for securing the network, thus increasing their stake in the network, thus increasing the odds of getting rewarded.  And so it goes.
If I am a new user on the network the only way that I can earn money by validating transactions is to stake coins that I already own in the network. If you compare this to PoW I simply have to run software on a machine I don't have to buy coins from someone to be able to secure the network. 
With a PoS coin it is possible to keep a person or group of people out of the network by not transacting with them. If you hold all of the coins, and staking coins is the only way in which new coins get minted, then theoretically it is possible to keep them from ever obtaining the currency. 
Imagine WW3 breaks out and HardCoin, a PoS chain, is the global reserve currency. It's not so hard to imagine a scenario where the large staker countries and their allies in the network starve out the enemy countries off the network.

Can't tell if you are serious, but I'll answer for the sake of education. When Miners create a new block they ad a transaction creating btc as a reward to themselves. This is called the coinbase, and it's where Coinbase the exchange gets it's name. Every transaction can be followed back to it's coinbase, the block where the coins we're originally mined.

In 1944 following WWII the USA and it's allies as well as a few others formed the Bretton Woods agreement one of the goals of this agreement was to make a single global currency called the "bancor" to serve as a unit of account between countries, a measuring stick for wealth if you will. What actually happened was the US dollar became that currency. The countries involved agreed that USD would suite the purpose as long as a single ounce of gold would always be redeemable for 35 USD. Since the dollar was backed by gold, countries could simply make their own currency backed by USD and not have to store any of their own gold. Lots of these European countries were also in a lot of debt to the US from the war so a bunch of gold got moved to america. At this time america had 2/3 of the gold in the world. Then the 70s happened. Nixon broke the promise made at Bretton Woods and prevented countries from redeeming USD for gold. Since then america had become the world police all in an attempt to make the dollar look strong. Even if Bitcoin simply filled the role that the bancor was supposed to play Bitcoin price would easily top $10 million. 
Btw. Almost all of the wars the us has gotten into in the last 30 years have stemmed from middle eastern leaders wanting to price things (oil) separate from the dollar.

It depends on your time scale. Bitcoin has been around for 10 years. As long has you didn't buy Bitcoin in a certain 5 month period in 2017/2018 Bitcoin has been an amazing investment for you.

This is th correct answer. DCA stands for dollar cost average. What this means is that instead of investing $5000 dollars in one moment, you invest $100 every week for 50 weeks, or similar plan. The idea is to spread out your exposure. We don't know what the market is going to do. DCA also is a good way for a new investor to practice restraint and build discipline.

The idea is that bitcoin cycles. It has since the beginning, and i believe will until we start seeing things priced in btc. If that's the case the pump and dumb cycles are your friend in helping you accumulate. I accumulated a bunch more by selling on the way up in 2017 and buying on the way down in 2018. I plan to do the same in 2019 2020.
