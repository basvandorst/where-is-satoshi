If you keep trying to do that you’re gonna have a bad time

Ok , can you explain that lol. I’m in Coinbase most of the time and I know how to move from one exchange to the other but if I wanted to sell some of my btc and eth how would I turn it into cash in a large sum like you said. Thanks.

I’m so used to government lying that when they say it’s bad I hear “it’s good”

Epstein’s was for child adrenochrome as well. Tbh I think that was the main purpose.

People didn’t believe elite politicians and the royal family were not involved in a giant pedophile/sex trafficking ring 80 days ago and people didn’t believe the church covered up pedophiles crimes a few years ago. All of a sudden harvesting adrenochrome from children they trafficked and raped is a conspiracy? I saw an article where the fbi divers were finding body’s around Epstein’s island but good luck finding it on google now. There’s a reason the fbi weaponized the term conspiracy theory and don’t forget everything that people have been told was once a “conspiracy” yet here were are with shit declassified from the government thinking it’s normal.

I’m a huge trump fan in only speculating what I think.
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:44:43
Ahhh indicators... I see. The current administrations policies had little or no effect on the awful economy it took over but the indicator showed it was going to turn around. You’re the kind of guy who should drink the kool aid.

What’s the best way to sell large sums out of curiosity
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:43:04
It’ll hit a new high, hopefully break the 50k mark like has been speculated and tank again except the new low won’t be 3k again. It’s going to do this for another few cycles before it stabilizes or disappears. I believe if trump wasn’t in office it would’ve already broke 50k but the stock market is breaking records every day.

HODL “in big letters”
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:39:34
Has it though? Listened to a little too much cnn I guess.
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:38:47
Yea for sure but it’s a lot harder for people to take it seriously when they’re making a killing in the stock market. I love btc and eth and want them to succeed more than anything but that’s the mindset of the people who control the money who all happen to be 30 and above.

I look at crypto charts like this and say “ah” and then I send it to my smart friends and see what they say.
