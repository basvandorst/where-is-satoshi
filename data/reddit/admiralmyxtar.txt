So a bunch of central parties speaking on behalf of whole community is OK? Why not use Ripple then? Any change pushed from the few into the many will kill true Bitcoin's philosophy. If S2X would have happened and be adopted instead of BTC, then it would be a slippery slope, like if someone got hacked, hey, let's get few central parties to one place and agree to roll back the chain, just like Ethereum did. And then Bcash would have had a true advantage, that they didn't roll back the chain, they are the true immutable ledger, and with 32x capacity bonus. It would have gathered a lot of support and the master plan of killing Bitcoin and replacing it with Bcash would have succeded.

Maybe it means Lightning Network as the log scaling soulution?

So you wanna someone to dox themselves for you? Maybe he should give you his private keys as well? And home address would be nice too.

Well, this time is much different. We can't expect today's market leaders go to zero, but it might still happen. I still think that 95%+ out of 1600+ cryptos will fail, and putting money in BTC is much safer than altcoins, but look at BTC dominance chart. BTC lost a lot of market share, down from 75-95% to X-50%, and X has chances to dip below 30 for the first time in history. ETH Flippenning might not occur, since it's competitors will eat away some of it's market cap, but it did get very close in summer 2017, and there was no Bcash back then. Bitcoin will still be one of the biggest (or the biggest) currency, maybe even forever, but alts are now much scarier than they were in 2013. The problem is - you don't know which alts will die, maybe EOS kills ETH, or other way around, or ADA/NEO will destroy everyone, or something new entirely will blow everything away. I'm not bearish on Bitcoin, but I'm on it's dominance. Buy hey, maybe 1 very rough multiyear bear market with 1300 USD/BTC sale will shake all alts away, who knows.

That's why Bitcoin is awful at store of value. You try to preserve your money, but the damn thing just keeps mooning all the time. How can I enjoy my wealth evaporating by doing nothing, aided by banks, if it does the complete opposite lol.

Give up people, somebody solved the puzzle and walked away with 1 BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:47:50
Well, GBP is ~1.35 USD now, so it is 135 USD right now.

And some other FUD news, new Bitcoin Obituary and some century old investor speaking against bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:52:01
Hmm, should I buy 1 BTC from some guy for $50K or go to any exchange and buy 6.67 BTC at $7500 each and HODL? That's a real head scratcher.
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:02:04
Have fun holding your useless bags lol

A 100$ bill worth of bitcon in 2012 is now 72000$. Would you rather store 72000$ in a safe or a wallet?
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:46:52
I personally don't think that BTC will grow that much, but you'll have some gainZZZ, just be sure to secure your coins well but don't oversecure them so in 5 years you won't be able to unlock them.
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:47:11
it's fake satoshi all over again lol
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:54:59
Secure your coins in your own wallet and have your private keys, and live a good life. Check in in a few years. It it goes to 0, you should be broken if didn't invest money you couldn't afford to lose. If it goes to the Sun (cause Moon is too close), then you might find small free 1 million dollar loan from past-you there.

Like Chalie Lee said on the podcast: forget about it for 5 years and then wonder, am I a millioner yet? You might be.

Good luck shorting the mania with 100x leverage in few weeks

Now it looks like a scam ICO or some shitcoin site, lol. But where is our floating points and links between them in the background? Not bashing Bitcoin, but design similarities are obvious.
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:27:22
Except it's backwards, when there's fear in the market everyone flees to Bitcoin and alts die, but Bitcoin can have rallies of it's own, like in December with 65% dominance, and alts still die. BTC going down and alts up is a very rare sight.
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:16:51
BcashillPay needs to die.
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:28:22
go to r/btc then
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:43:17
For now, there's another half, the one between June and December, remember?
@_date: 2018-06-09 02:32:29
Miners have to signal for that.

Because there's almost nothing to complain about now, fees are pretty low now.

Soft forks are better for Bitcoin because it's much more decentralized than some other alts. In centralized systems, hard forks are better since they don't leave good tech go unused, but a hard fork of Bitcoin would split the community even more, and we're already in a civil war of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-06-10 05:17:32
Why so sure about "will never be"? Bulletproofs and Confidential Transactions are a part of Core's roadmap.
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:38:43
You are blind to logic. BTC drops by 65%, Bolivar drops by 99.999%, so is 35% of your wealth is better than 0.001%? Not if I listen to you. Of course, investing in USD would be much better, but why did you cherrypick an exact top? 
@_date: 2018-06-09 02:10:45
Bitfinex truly being shady, a hack, printing Tether to repay the hack, printing Tether to squeeze shorts, then sell off to squeeze longs, blocking accounts right on peak of the bubble...
@_date: 2018-06-10 05:26:01
Sure, but it's much less trackable than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-21 04:10:44
And only IOTA and Monero beat Bitcoin in Y/Y growth now, even though BTC dominance was higher back then.
