@_date: 2014-11-11 06:14:03
then what would I spend my spare money on??
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:09:01
what is seen as less volatile? I have some gold and silver (physical) and USD in the bank and a few shares but they just bore me.

Well done Rebit! Nice work. I am setting up Vibittance in Vietnam to allow people to remit money from overseas to Vietnam and for the OFW to remit money back home, get in touch if you think we can work together somehow.

This is the safest way to store your Bitcoins

Hi, 
I got the idea from here after seeing this video and I decided to get 1 made for my basement den. 
The text idea came from here: 
The design actually was done by the owner of the LED shop. But you are right they are pretty similar but regarding the text placement that would be pretty standard for a round logo with text. The LED sign is pretty different as there are a number of different light transitions, whereas the neon is a constant glow...Orange and Yellow are pretty standard Bitcoin colours.
Also, look what I posted above: 
'The sample sign will be finished in 4 days, I will post some photos when they are finished.'
Obviously its not a photo.
@_date: 2014-06-12 06:06:25
I live in Vietnam - I can buy a car, motorbike or house with gold. Silver is for the kids in 20+ years, whatever it is worth goes towards their university fees. Physical PM's also stop me from 'spending' my money - locked away in 3 different bank deposit boxes. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:10:45
It has reached $1200 so anything below that seems value to me. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 08:10:13
Thanks, I will read those later and respond in more detail -  bit too long to take in right now - although i have LTC as it allows me to diversify my risk. Litecoin has a non anonymous creator who is not holding a hell of a lot of coins. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 06:07:57
The reasons for the arrests in Khanh Hoa was because of lack of business licences, tax registration, violating labor laws. If you know anything about VN you will understand the corruption here. The government sucks. 
They give each orphan $12 a month in subsidies, the orphanages pay a tax of $10 per child.

@_date: 2014-06-19 10:25:53
I apologise I don't mean to berate people but just a general comment calling me a scam with no substance upsets me. 
I am privileged to be born in the UK, I am also lucky to have lived here in Vietnam for many years. The Vietnamese are amazing people but they are also very poor here. Their are so many children born with serious defects due to the use of toxins during the war. Orphanages are seriously over crowded, under funded and under staffed.
Especially if people took 2 minutes to look at the links, videos, photos, news articles
I visit Go vap often with my wife and my kids, we help out, we clean them, we feed them! we give them medicine! we play with them but most of all we show them they are loved and not alone. 
They need help though  we raise money here though charity drives you can google their Facebook.
Please watch these videos and just think about what you can do to help. If people don't want to donate Bitcoin fine, but why not send some old clothes or toys direct to the orphanage, you do not understand what'd difference you would make.

Just my 2 cents but lots of people who work overseas remit money to their families back home, who need it for everyday spending...thats why a lot of Filipinos leave the Philippines...to earn money to support their families..
@_date: 2014-08-31 01:46:45
Thanks, not done by me, just helping a friend out - I suggested he do them to help pay for his uni fees in Vietnam. Hope it takes the place on someone's wall:)

Gold and Silver have been used as 'money' for years, they were the most common form of money throughout history. Here in Asia gold is frequently used as 'money' - you say gold 'was' money but it still is money - in China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia etc it can be used to purchase property, vehicles etc, deposit down gold in the bank for a mortgage etc... Will read  the articles you posted later, thanks
@_date: 2014-06-10 02:05:28
Nice post...So i live in Vietnam, I have 2 Filipino nannies - I pay them in USD, they send it all back home... Could i send direct to you to send to their families?

The Go Vap Orphanage in Vietnam accepts Bitcoins and Litecoins - well via me they do not have a computer. They then provide receipts for the donations which I convert to Vietnam Dong and post online with the orphanages contact details incase anyone wants to call them to confirm. 
I am currently planning a Christmas Fundraiser for the children at Go Vap. 
You can see the last fundraiser I did here: 
If you are interested in helping them have an awesome Christmas get in touch - I do not take any money for this at all, in fact I have often donated food, toys, medicine and money of my own. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:15:49
at this point i would rather have bitcoins, gold and silver as opposed to USD or Dong

Not a bad move but never keep all your eggs in 1 basket, get some Litecoin as well. Litecoin is very undervalued right now.

The signs are just one thing that I have been looking into since last year. It would not make much sense to use red or green or purple as for the LEDs, as there is no link to BTC with these colors. Orange, Yellow, White are the colors associated with [btc]. The design of both signs is basically the basis for many BTC logo vectors:
We have been working on a project for a crypto store for the last six months with all of these items being manufactured here in Vietnam. In my research, I realized that it was possible to custom make anything here in Vietnam at a good price and with high quality. 
We have spent months visiting clothing manufactures to find the perfect quality material and design for the crypto clothing line I plan to bring out in July. I have spent hours watching metal plates be engraved, lathed and glasses and mugs being etched with various Bitcoin and Litecoin logos (all orange, yellow, silver, black - standard BTC/LTC colours).  
We have travelled to Northern Vietnam to research custom laser engraving factories for manufacturing key rings and steel cold storage wallets. I have a basement with thousands of BTC/LTC stickers, custom hologram cold wallet protection stickers and scratch pads. We will be selling BTC/LTC posters and decals, car bumper stickers and of course Vietnamese coffee because that would be a crime to not share it with the world. 
Furthermore, we are not just doing this to profit from crypto currencies. 15% of all of monthly profits will be donated to the Bitcoin and Litecoin developers as we truly believe in the future of Crypto.[/b]
Here is my previous post back in Feb about our plans: [url=
Until we are 100% ready to go, I will not let the website go live, we still have issues with Gocoin which i hope are resolved shortly. This post for the LED signs is a sample order to see what the interest is and to see if they are priced right.

How does this make it harder by adding Litecoin? 
One reason i got into LTC was the transaction times, BTC is pretty darn slow. When I buy BTC in person it literally takes 10 minutes (or more) to get one confirmation and no one will complete the transaction unless they see at least 1 confirmation.
There is also that little issue with the founder holding 1million BTC and so I believe LTC has had a much more fair distribution. Then there's association with Silk Road and the death of Mt. Gox leaving a bad taste in the mouth of new potential BTC adopters. Negative news after negative news.
If you're storing a large portion of your wealth in only one blockchain then thats just stupid, relying on 1 block chain to secure your networth, how does that make sense? 
The problem with Bitcoin is  downloading the blockchain and waiting on confirmations takes a lifetime. When I use Litecoin it actually feels more than 4x faster than Bitcoin. 
Again you have anonymous founder or BTC but the founder of Litecoin is out in the open, working as a manager at Coinbase and has a giant 'We accept Litecoin' neon sign hanging in his office?
Here is a recent post from Charlie..
The reasons we are not adding Litecoin today are:
Paradox of choice - need to design UI in such a way that it's powerful for people who want to use Litecoin and Bitcoin and not overwhelming for new users
Lack of liquidity - need more trusted (i.e. not anonymous) exchanges with large volumes
Engineering resources constraint - other projects are more important
(1) is solvable by some good UI design. Maybe a secret URL ( to opt-in in creating a Litecoin wallet. FYI, I actually implemented the multiple wallet feature.
(2) can be worked around by doing more internalizing of buys and sells and depend less on exchanges.
(3) will resolve over time. As more important projects get launched, Litecoin will become higher on the list of TODOs. Btw, I recently became an engineering manager at Coinbase with 5 direct reports, so I have some say on what projects they work on. :D

LTC has a good development team, 2nd highest market cap and daily volume, ASIC's will secure the network. Bitcoin has a lot more but I do see a future for LTC.

What is wrong with people - seriously...perhaps in your life you just think about No 1 but some of us don't. 
People thought I was a scam on Litecoin Talk - thats why the money was held in escrow. I posted the number for the orphanage, the phone number for the newspaper reporters. 
There are a lot of selfish people in this world. 
You may be too lazy to do anything to help others but some of us are not, trust me if you spent 2 minutes at Go Vap Orphanage, you would struggle to sleep for a few days after seeing what the kids go through.
