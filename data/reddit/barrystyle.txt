huh? just noticed this reply. i've re-read your post 3 times now and still don't understand what you're getting at.
are you basically saying 'prove you've actually done it' or do you think i'm only talking about a simulated hashing session?
i found a block of litecoin using nicehash scrypt power, pointed at a nomp instance polling litecoind (hosted on digitalocean) on christmas day last year (2015).
3317906811 / 65536 = 50627.24 which is greater than the difficulty at that time (49565.52) resulting in me winning the block.
trolling..? 
honestly if you and your brethren spent less time learning and misunderstanding new buzzwords on these forums (honestly i thought bitcointalk was bad..) and more time just learning on your own - cryptocurrency would be 5 years ahead of where it is.

i thought i'd covered all bases, your reply leaves me stumped as to your level of intelligence (then i remember i am on reddit after all).
noone is saying it will discover a key pair with a balance in 5 seconds; nor 10 years (i did state eternity), but eventually it will once all 2^256 private keys are eventually generated.

to not think that it will work is imbecility. a collision is inevitable; if the program was set to run continuously for the rest of eternity, it'd find a key/pair that inevitably has a balance.

They both eventuate from a need to securely store data in a sequential manner.. again, the contents of the block are largely irrelevant.


The way in which the block size is measured is irrelevant, bits/bytes are both similar units. You could give a block size in bits or bytes and it would still have the same end result.
Block sizes are **not** measured in minutes. The 'minutes' component is purely due the amount of time in which the block itself is solved; the amount of transactions that made it into the block depend on a number of factors, as well as the particulars of the setup (are we simply mining on top of header of existing block - SPV/Defensive mining, are we ignoring all transactions?).
Please read this:  and this (
Also note the following passage, 'The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography'.

All participants have an identical copy of the ledger, which can't be rolled back or altered without all participants agreeing, with the added benefit of it containing transactions (in order) which can be replayed from any point for analysis.

If you read through the entire wikipedia reference ( you'll see that it does refer to sequential blocks. What you actually stuff into the blocks (ie. transactions forming a database) is irrelevant.
You've said it yourself, 'Bitcoin Blockchain', its own derivative.
My point is, the 'block cipher' definition covers the fundamental aspect of Blockchain tech, which is a given block cannot be modified/altered after the fact without invalidating all other blocks. Early block cipher modes did not provide this; however the later ones did such as HMAC.
Have a read about HMAC and its relation to Bitcoin/Hashcash.
I feel you're being quite pendantic about wording; the underlying concept of a sequential series of blocks, containing payload which cannot be altered is not specific to Bitcoin.

Valid point.
I'm guessing though, that the 'total bitcoins' figure above doesn't contain Bitcoin currently being used as fees which are currently in the air/mempool (ie. not yet committed to a block).

Couldn't agree more.
Every second post I see is from a user who is particularly 'wordy', yet cannot code and has a very very limited (and often incorrect) understanding of how Bitcoin actually works. Once the actual issue is cleared up; the following posts turn incredibly self-righteous and all original intents are lost.
It's fantastic that people have an opinion, and that they can easily voice it. However, if you cannot code (or learn how to code, or at least learn how to learn) then FOAD.

Ideally any cryptocurrency 'highest profitability' reporting setup would have running instances of the wallet which they query using RPC JSON at regular intervals ('getmininginfo' would yield enough detail). I'll assume you're talking Scrypt coins although most work on a variation of this formula.
The 'highest profitability' is easily calculable with a few variables that we already know like our own/pools hashrate, block time of a given coin (no standard way of knowing this other than looking at an alt's code), block reward/halving schedule (same as previous) and the highest current 'buying' rate of that currency.
Say we have 45Mh hashpower on hand and we are hashing against Globalcoin (40 sec block time, currently 3.125 GLC block reward, buy requests at 45 sat per GLC, difficulty of 0.18849067).
First, we work out how many hashes/sec we need to find one standard block, within the standard block time.
    Hashes per second = Difficulty * 2^32 / Blocktime_in_seconds
    = 0.18849067 * 4294967296 / 40 = 20239031.58 hashes/sec
    = 20239031.58 / 1000000 = 20.23Mh/sec
This means, if we had 20.23Mh of Scrypt Hashpower - we would find 1 block every 40 seconds. This is 'ideal', not taking into account variations of difficulty through Block retargeting algorithms, finding blocks early raising difficulty (KGW/Elastic band effect) and of course, competing with other mining setups for the block.
This can be crudely manipulated to work out a 'per minute' BTC rating:
    (60 / Blocktime_in_seconds) * (Block_reward * Highest_buy_request) = BTC per minute
    (60 / 40) * (3.125 * 0.00000045) = 0.000002109BTC/min
We can even get our 'bully factor' included, as with higher than 20.23Mh/sec hashpower (the 45Mh mentioned earlier) - we will find blocks earlier than standard block time:
    (Our_hashpower / Hashpower_reqd_per_standard_blocktime) * per_minute_rating = BTC per minute (with higher hashpower)
    (45 / 20.23) * (60 / 40) * (3.125 * 0.00000045) = 0.00000469BTC/min
Now all we do - is monitor a given number of coins, apply the same formula to each and recalculate every 5-15 seconds and we will see for any given moment, what the 'highest profitable' coin given your own hashrate.
There are other methods for calculating profitability and also where to get these statistics without having to run a full wallet (not just scraping webdata) but this is a subject for another day.
BTW: Disregard any calculator that bases profit around existing 'nethashrate' variable, as this is usually rubbish.
@_date: 2015-12-28 12:29:52
You're still talking in a currency mindset 'transferral of value'; the block contents will be in a proprietary format suited to how transferrals occur between banks. The block becomes the wrapper, and the validation/signing ensures it can't be tampered with.
Validation occurs in POW as well, just by the way.
@_date: 2015-12-29 01:47:57
You do realise that a large portion of the hashrate originates from outside of China, right?

The banks are interested in Blockchain technology; as it allows them to run a distributed ledger amongst themselves that cannot be falsified, where all participating must agree that transactions are valid. This makes sense considering the amount of money passed between them.
To those crying foul; it isnt a cryptocurrency (nor would it want to be) and there will most likely never be a software product released to the public (just as little reason for the banks to release the software they currently use to us now).
I really think people are confused as to how Bitcoin and Blockchain technology works.. Bitcoin needs its own form of Blockchain technology (with incentives to process blocks) but Blockchain technology doesnt need Bitcoin.
I find the majority of people crying foul from the rooftops, cant conceptualize nor program.
@_date: 2015-12-26 13:41:20
Blockchain is a broad concept that can be implemented a number of ways, none of which need to be currency-based. It essentially relies on complete checksum of the contents of previous blocks before it, so they can be written sequentially and if any modifications occur/tampered with, the checksum will not match the given hash (hence the ledger concept used by all cryptocurrencies).

While it is a generous gesture (just like BTCC's decision not to continue SPV mining or withhold blocks whilst mining to build on), theres nothing stopping any of you from starting a node.

I think you've misunderstood whats going on.
R3 are not coming up with a new 'coin', nor will there be any software released to the public.
The banks would simply like a undesputable ledger system between participating members (ie. themselves), that can't be altered and is shared. This is the entire concept behind trustless blockchain technology. 
The banks have a perfect system for their actual customer-base.. choose to open Mon-Fri 8-4 reducing your access to your money, if not charging you on top for using an ATM - reducing your access to your money, their archaic online systems which do not give you 'reasons' for deposits not clearing in a timely manner/threat of your money going walkies (reducing your access to your money) and the 'topper' being on the phone for 45 minutes for a seemingly simple enquiry. Why would they pass their shiny new Blockchain tech to their customers?
Why would there be a currency, block reward or.. 'ugh' PoS? It is just a means of keeping track of data.

Bitcoin is decentralized by nature, but it can be re-encapsulated with a few sneaky tricks (or just plain common greed by a collective group) and effectively re-centralized.
Mining is only going to get more competitive and dishonest in the next 5 years. Mining as a service is already done to death. I switch off (like everyone else) when I hear sidechains. Relationships with governments for subsidized power will lead to further centralization.
You talk buzzwords and visions; but you don't seem to have much technical insight - which just makes you a speculator.

This is due to the 'echoing' effect of hosts situated behind the Great Firewall of China. Once F2Pool or Antpool find a block, it usually bounces between them for a while due to block propagation lagging back outside to the rest of the world (or them mining on top of each others headers using dead mining clients, whilst withholding blocks).
By the time any host outside of the Firewall starts receiving new block data, you can guarantee that hosts behind the firewall already have a 30 second head start.
Have a look at what happened to DogeCoinDark/Verge 2-4 weeks back; someone with around 200Gh of Scrypt power was belting the chain up to a difficulty of 12000+, then resuming mining using the same hashpower on a small 2 node pool. Once their greed was satisfied, they would reconnect their 'private' pool back to their stand-in node and flood the network with a new chain 400-800 blocks ahead. They know no other party has anywhere near that hashpower available, very sneaky and something that decentralization unfortunately cannot do much about.
The miners are all built in China as well, which creates a monopoly. They are then exported to the rest of the world at a premium. Luke Jr's suggestion to change from SHA256 to another algorithm wasn't a bad idea; as it makes the playing field a lot more even - i think the way he went about proposing it wasnt the best, but it was a smart bold move that noone else wanted to back because of their own vested interests (see a recurring theme here?).
Bitcoin itself still seems to function well however.
I think we can all see a few possible benefits of centralization; after withnessing firsthand the disadvantages of decentralization.

Very true; I remember remarking to a mate about a year back that Bitcoin/Altcoins are like a Communist nation, built on good ideas and intentions - however we soon see selfish behaviour, society dividing itself into 'pockets' and ultimately corruption. Having a centralized government is only nice when trouble presents itself.

MICKEY: Why not?
KRAMER: Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.
MICKEY: So you can't get Corned Beef?
KRAMER: Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.
Since most decisions have been ad-hoc and majority based so far – sadly, I think this is the way it will continue.
I look, in disdain, at  and see one Bitcoin Developer included in the foundation. Shouldn’t all contributing developers be there? Wouldn’t this be the perfect place for any future decisions to be made (it does seem old-fashioned, but still better than continually forking github code).
However, on the functional side it works great for the end-user.

Do you think the GFC problem only affects blocks?

I'm all for a free market.
However, there's doing things the right way, or the other method; abusing known vulnerabilities in Bitcoin (SPV/Header-mining, Block withholding, Dead-mining on others pools), which ultimately is just going to ruin it for everyone... for your gain? C'mon.


Saying "re-centralized" as an end state makes your thinking rigid and seemingly unable to think of a networks' level of centralization as a fluid variable, which can change to maximize efficiency, redundancy, and security, like bitcoin.
This line of reasoning can be summed up as, bitcoin is as decentralized as it needs to be, and can change if it needs to change. That can't be refuted at this point, because it is currently working.
7.4 billion mining full nodes? Huh?
Each node is its own authority and can process transaction/blocks as long as a set number of rules/conditions are followed. This is effectively how decentralization works at all. It doesn't need to 'trust' anyone.
Re-centralization as an encapsulation method literally does not need further explaining. I'd advise you go learn read 'Layers of Abstraction' in regards to solving/managing computer problems. Perhaps even basic virtualization theory; as to how a process/network can be contained yet has no way of knowing it is in a controlled environment. You might be able to draw some parallels there.


Google Nicehash/Westhash, Mining rig rentals, any Cloud-based mining service will suffice. Go search eBay for 'Mining Contracts'; this sort of thing has existed for at least 4-5 years.


Everyone switches off; it's just like reading another 'Blockchain' startup companies blurb on a news feed. It is by definition a side-chain, the data is not contained within Bitcoin Blocks itself; so will always remain as an optional extra that will garner little/no interest.


Huh? If 20 countries were competing on providing the most mining friendly situations, it would likely increase decentralization. But then, as I said above, bitcoin wouldn't necessarily need that. It might still tend toward centralization if the market valued efficiency over redundancy, and function just fine. Another idea is, perhaps isp's will compete for mining and guarantee protection against government subpoenas/actions etc, in exchange for a small share of profits. Who knows. Got any ideas? It's only limited by your imagination.
You've just involved 'Government'. With 'Government' or more appropriately 'Governance', you've just reintroduced the key factor that Bitcoin was designed to get away from. I literally cannot believe you've suggested this.


You tire me, i've literally given nothing other than logic as well as explanations. Get off my lawn.

A Bitcoin ASIC receives a string known as a hash. It performs what is known as Double SHA256, which could be represented by a formula like SHA256(SHA256(x)). It does this repetitively against the same data, until the resulting 'hash' matches a target/set of rules dictated by the controller (inbuilt/connected to a computer).
This would be more than useless to reveal any weaknesses in SHA256 used in a traditional form; or the classic 'conspiracy theory' that the Government is building a set of Rainbow Tables that would allow them to decipher any SHA256 encrypted data, because they have the known output of any possible hash (Rainbow Tables do exist for GSM scarily enough, look them up.. however these are designed around a 13bit system).
This does not rule out the possibility of someone with infinite time and resources, casting their own true brute-force SHA256 silicon and going for broke.
Quantum computing is said to pose a far bigger threat to the inbuilt protection mechanisms of Bitcoin itself however..

As long as you understand the facts and are able to challenge the 'FUD', there is no problem. Same way it has always been.


Core has always been the standard branch of development; you could argue that all the other 'forks' have slowed things down.


How? They've essentially released a self-contained bitcoin node, with a different front-end and a set of APIs?
It mines against their own private pool; and it wasn't made clear from the start how the earnings were split.
Storage is already at half of its limit; Jan 2016 the BTC chain was approx 53Gb, by the start of April will be 63Gb.
Assuming a jump to 2mb blocks in the next 4 months, storage will be looking very bloated around January next year.


Majority of the world's SHA256 power is behind the Great Firewall of China, known for its lack of throughput and high block propagation times. Once a block has been found behind the GFC; it usually takes some time before an external pool finds a block due to the delays/echoes.
I honestly doubt any major advances will occur here. I thought LukeJr's Algorithm change proposal was a good idea; as this single move itself will limit the monopoly the Chinese currently have over the currency.


Yes - but not Bitcoin itself; they are just after the Blockchain technology which Bitcoin relies on, but can be extracted and used for any purpose (tamper-proof incremental records); doesn't have to be a currency-based application either.


I've always admired that whatever situation has been labelled the 'Bitcoin Killer', Bitcoin always seems to emerge unscathed.
As long as people are interested, it will always stick around and I think the duration itself (2009-2016) is already impressive given its humble beginnings.

still more than possible to find a block using rented hashpower.
@_date: 2016-06-02 18:11:06
Check this out:
This is what Antpool does with its empty blocks - they don't go to the miner. Anyone who spends anymore time debating blocksize is fucking retarded - these pools have been laughing while you bicker.

And hows that?
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:47:33
i think you're mistaken, core is the direct descendent, the others are alternatives. just checked again, yep - direct descendent.

Selfish mining.
Antpool are renowned for not announcing blocks that they find, so they hold the advantage over other pools.
I've personally watched Antpool mine three blocks in a row without announcing them (tell-tale behaviour from their stratum); only to lose all three when an honest pool announced the first block (that they had found by that stage), to the rest of the world.
This has been done to death guys, mining headers with a deadminer, SPV mining; why become interested now?

So if you store your blockchain on a Seagate harddrive; is Seagate another third party you have to trust?

OP is talking about some reward for simply running a node; a reward for the node owner.
Please keep up.

all the information that you need to successfully mine a block of bitcoin; is the latest block hash and details of your coinbase transaction (where your mined coins are going to). the block hash is 32 bytes long (hex string of 64 base16 digits) and is the big number you see listed on the site i posted. you do actually need a few other variables, but these are easy to determine on your own machine.
what large pools, for instance antpool and f2pool, like to do is not announce when they've found a block to the rest of the world. this means they basically hold the advantage (known as selfish mining), as they get a head start on finding the next bitcoin block.
the 'tell-tale' sign of this happening, is connecting a miner to the pool and watching the stratum messages (stratum detected a new block) whilst keeping an eye on a bitcoin block explorer (such as blockchain.info). if the stratum messages indicate that the pool is on a new block, for a significant amount of time, before any block explorers/bitcoin nodes become aware of a new block; this means the pool is trying to find its second (or third) block in a row.
i've personally witnessed antpool mine 3 blocks on top of each other (without announcing any of them); and then 'lose the lot' as an honest pool announced the first block, that they'd found, by surprise - invalidating the blocks antpool had found.
on a more technical note; you could quickly script something that scrapes the newest block hash from the stratum messages and then tells the pool to switch to the new blockhash (regardless if your local bitcoin daemon is still on the old one). nomp/unomp provide a cli script to do this.
now as if that weren't bad enough, some of these dishonest pools are in cahoots (f2pool, antpool, btcc, bw) and actually share the latest block hash amongst each other.
some people will tell you they do this for bandwidth reasons or that they're behind the great firewall of china; so a local channel is required to ensure block propogation. however this is absolute garbage, as even behind a slow firewall like the gfc, bitcoin nodes will still communicate amongst themselves and do just this.
transactions do enter into the argument here to a lesser degree; as some of the worst offending pools (ahem) simple mine blocks with no transactions aside from the coinbase transaction. this is done because of greed and also to ensure the block gets quickly propogated throughout the bitcoin network (the irony). some pools attempt to stuff a few transactions (or send to their own addresses) into these blocks to make themselves feel better, and also to make sure the block is accepted by all other nodes.
quite a few of the tricks they employ may no longer work with the big changes coming up in the future of bitcoin; which is why they do not want to shift to new software. no 'philisophical' bullshit reasons like i see in headlines every day, life is not a zero sum game - its purely financial.
i'm sure ive missed a bunch of stuff, but there you have it.
(the point of the site is to illustrate when one of the pools is mining ahead on a newer block hash, if you watch it for a while you'll see)

Impossible means that it cannot be done, as in no method exists to perform this feat.
It is certainly possible, but impractical.
If you cycle through every possible private key, starting from zero to 1.1579208923731619542357098500869e+77 (2^256), whilst calculating its public key pair, you will eventually hit a public/private key pair that matches the intended account.

ah, my apologies, all valid points.
i had a dispute with the vps company and the site is currently down, once its back up i'll revisit this post.
@_date: 2016-12-17 14:28:30
how? give some constructive criticism.
you havent given a very good reply.

A Bitcoin node can be run comfortably in an Amazon EC2 t2.small instance which costs roughly $25/mo to run.
Being a 'community' based revolution; I see no issue why a few mates can't throw together the $300/yr necessary to run a node. I run one full-time on a t2.medium for approx $50/mo, just so I have it there if I need it for any reason and this hardly breaks the bank.
No incentive required. Incentives just lead to devious behaviour. Pay it forward.

bunch of fucken retards on reddit these days, no shit.
it is possible.
has been done.
read, stfu, then foad.
no wordy, pathetic, typical reddit-esque style responses needed here.

No-one uses brainwallets anymore since this topic was done to death in 2014. Sophos are obviously ahead of their game.
For anyone who missed this (i'd recommend Sophos have a read) and is in the mood for some nostalgia:

might be an idea to actually read their site in its entirety.
they've recovered money.

You can certainly do worse than BFL when it comes to pre-orders (remember HASHRA everyone?); I found the fact they released their PCB designs as well as Source Code (which actually compiles) to be quite an honest move, as well as incredibly helpful when trying to get every last hash per second out of the machine as possible.
I know most of the Bitforce range (pre-Monarch) utilized a FPGA chip, which was reprogrammable without too much hassle.. if you were so technically inclined, you could get the unit to hash algorithms other than SHA256d. Not sure if the Monarchs utilized dedicated hashing IC's or the same FPGA approach.
By the way luke-jr.. I've never been able to get your 'bitforce-firmware-flash.c' to work, it always seems to pause just before sending the headers/magic to the device (the unit seems to reply with OK
ECHO - not sure if this is an unexpected response, or an issue with the FTDI RS232H UART?).

thats not how doublespending works.
your transaction will sit there until a node decides to include it in a block. it may even possibly expire as mempool grows and you might have to resync your wallet to get your bitcoin back.

That's a single spend as it was only counted once. A doublespend is where you are able to spend one output twice. Derp.
@_date: 2015-10-06 02:58:30
So.. they're basically operating their own exclusive pool and selling their own hardware to run against it?
If they're already finding blocks (check blockchain.info) and the unit isnt available for sale, how do you think they are ensuring their ROI?
How do you think they are burning in the units before sale?
Wake up.

Dude thats neat; should try and grab the different versions that clients report as well (could match IP addresses within the last hour with the versioninfo reported).
Either via debug.log or python-libbitcoin which you're using.
Clean and well presented.
@_date: 2016-05-25 14:05:11
can you post details of a 'getpeerinfo'?
particularly interested if they are showing zero bytes sent/received and if their version number is -1.. i've had this happen recently on a bunch of different cryptocurrencies, even shitcoins..
@_date: 2016-07-02 10:48:26
No? People still do it regularly... as little as 4-8 Petahash can find you a block.. I still find Litecoin blocks with as little as 20Gh of rented scrypt.
@_date: 2016-07-02 10:46:57
it will not be '1 Apr. 2020, 13:04:17 GMT'.
the bitcoin block target of 10 minutes is due to the difficulty algorithm retargetting depending on how quickly previous blocks have been solved.
due to the world hashrate constantly changing, dipping and spiking, blocks have often gone 30 minutes without being solved; with other blocks having been solved within 1-5 minutes of each other.
have a look at the spacing on a site like blockchain.info
i notice a lot of long term bitcoin'ers still think that it is 10 minutes for no other reason; some of these have been very loud supporters of stupid shit like bitcoin classic.. just makes you wonder where we're headed
