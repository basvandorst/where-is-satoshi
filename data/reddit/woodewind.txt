did you visit the link to the goxcoin proposal?  all they would have to do is turn in their account database and goxcoin &amp; mastercoin can work from there. i think this is huge because it was assumed that lost bitcoins could never be recovered. this is a proactive stance towards the echoes of mt gox news.

Small mining pools have larger variance and could hit dry times where there's hours between finding new blocks. Can be more vulnerable.
Large mining pools have lower variance and a steady payouts. Can afford to be DDOS resistant.
Pool sizes does make a difference, but it depends on what you are looking for in a mining pool. 
You should always consider using a p2pool ( though.

How can the reporter deem this event as a reason to reguateBitcoin if that is even possible?  Mt gox or any other exchange is not needed for p2p or in person exchanges. Bitcoin has continued to function and while I am looking forward to Gavin's changes coming in [v.9]( Bitcoin works perfectly fine without regulation. 
It is sad that some have lost btc, but it is the freakin' free market. People are free to use or stay away from exchanges. We are all adults here. Businesses will succeed or fail &amp; this event will benefit the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.

tl;dr 4 Predictions
- 1. Bitcoin will likely be valuable first in places with wild currency fluctuations
- 2. Bitcoin is rough around the edges and innovators will be creating businesses that make using Bitcoin better, easier, more beautiful.
- 3. If Bitcoin innovators in the U.S. are forced to deal with regulations like banks do, innovation will happen where regulations are not as fierce.
- 4. Non-profits are primed to be the earliest organizational Bitcoin adopters

Sorry. You just seemed blatantly negative. I will explain what I know.
There was a window of about a month at the end of the summer of 2013 where JR Willet (lead dev) said he would be raising funds for Mastercoin. The way people within this fundraising window traded Bitcoin for Mastercoin was by sending their Bitcoins to an [Exodus]( address. When the window for fundraising had closed, this method of changing BTC to Mastercoins would end.
JR set up several incentives in that time window like donating in the first week got you an extra percentage of Mastercoins. I believe the price at the time was 1 BTC got you 100 Mastercoins and 100 Test Mastercoins.
Now one of the ways I know you can get Mastercoins is to use their self serve order book called [mcoin.io]( This is peer to peer and no exodus address is involved. The main requirement for these OTC trades are owning the wallet you send and receive from. They require you sign from your wallet address. They are also about to release a decentralized exchange.
They are building a lot in a short amount of time and they really should be called the bountycoin because they have bounties for every aspect of development and promotion. From T-shirt design to software development. 
And I just recently read they are releasing an Omniwallet which will support several altcoins. They will be giving out bounties for whoever helps with implementing [Litecoin and Peercoin support](
Just an FYI, I've seen several people confuse Ethereum, which is a scriptable DAC with it's own coin that trades with Ether, with Mastercoin. A good way to frame these two technologies is to think of Mastercoin like open source LEGO kits and Ethereum like Thingiverse and a 3d printer. This isn't the best comparison, but I think it helps.

If you were to tokenize a $10 Target Card, you would send someone 10 TARGET tokens (e.g. 1 TARGET = 1 USD) to a Bitcoin address that supported such a thing (counterparty,etc.). 
There are several issues with this route as TARGET would have to be the first to register their name or publicly announce whatever TOKEN name they were using. And leaving the value of a TARGET token up to the market can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it.
The positive is you could trade these TARGET tokens for BTC outside of Gyft's system as long as there are TARGET buyers. Hell, you could trade TARGET for WALMART tokens or WHOLEFOODS tokens, which opens up retail token exchange with cards that are normally one way like Starbucks gift cards.

Gliph is primarily for encrypted messages. Sending Bitcoins from a connected Coinbase account is a feature that was added on afterwards.
Yes Apple sucks for yanking apps, but try to get them the moment you hear of them. Pretty sure the blockchain iPhone app is available as I had my friend install it this week.

There are several gambling sites that use Bitcoins exclusively. I also know [some minecraft servers]( pay their users Bitcoins for each block they mine.  The payout is extremely small, but it keeps traffic flowing to the server.
As throck said, humblebundle just clusters games together that can be paid for with Bitcoins.

I think that way of thinking is best. Sometimes trying to convince someone isn't the same as them seeing the magic for themselves. 
If they've been given Bitcoins, the feeling of seeing it worth more is enough to win them over.

[LocalBitcoins]( is probably the easiest decentralized solution and if you take [appropriate precautions]( ([method to detect counterfeit bills]( [Enable 2 factor authentication]( you can avoid having to provide any personal information to a 3rd party. Here's an [excellent account]( of a great localbitcoin trade.
There are other centralized solutions like, Bitstamp, Coinbase, CampBx, Btc-e, but the experience with these companies varies if you read posts in r/Bitcoin.
Bitcoin ATMs, as they are released, are also excellent ways to go back and forth from BTC to fiat.

Altcoins are really good as playgrounds. A way to experiment without touching Bitcoin source code.  If there's a bug that could affect Bitcoin them it can be addressed before a lot of Bitcoiners are affected.

I was expecting to see the bitcoin logo next to the paypal logo. Even better to see the Bitcoin logo before checking out.

It would have been 100% decentralized if he would have exchanged with independent individuals.  Those exchanges are clearly centralized if 1 person can walk away with funds.

I think they are relaying the messages that are getting traffic at this point. Any story that is sensational... new high or moral low... is what gets published. 
I look forward to your article.
You should also cover the perspective I've read about, where Bitcoin allows it's owners to be shareholders and own a piece of Bitcoins value. As the use and utility increase all who have a share benefit by a Bitcoin being perceived as more valuable. 
I've never understood how the exchange price relates to Bitcoin's value, because there are certain countries like Argentina where it is the best currency option. In countries like India where gold needs to be smuggled in to store wealth, Bitcoin is the clear path of least resistance.

You need to add a logo that shows you accept Bitcoin at the bottom.

If you downloaded the blockchain or coinbase app before they were yanked from the Apple store you'd have those two options. the iphone could jailbroken.

agreed. the altcoins are playgrounds for all to see what features work and which ones don't. Primecoin is an interesting one as well.

The difficult is to ensure 10 minute blocks. If the total Bitcoin hashrate pushes block times faster than 10 minutes then the difficulty increases.  If block times are slower than 10 minutes the difficulty drops.  The difficulty is adjusted every 12 days.

some thought it will crash.  some still don't ynderstand it. it is easier just to set them up with secure wallets and get them their coins early so they can get exited about the rise. 
i'm wondering if there will be a jobs for bitcoiners to manage the wealth of those who aren't tech savvy.

Mastercoin has this feature called a [guardian address]( One address can control the Bitcoins in another address and retrieve it in bad situations.

1.5) Quick Money transfer (please double check these numbers for accuracy)
Try using moneygram and western union's calculator to see how much is charged in money transfer fees. i've seen anywhere from 3%-11%. paypal is around 2.5% but has a cluster of payment tiers based on the type of account you have. paypal also tacks on a 2.5% fee for switching currencies. 
Compare that to an average *fixed fee* of around 10-11 cents or .0001 btc of a typical bitcoin transfer.
