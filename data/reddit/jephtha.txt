Horizon documentaries are usually very good. I read somewhere that the mention of bitcoin isnt much which is weird given that this is a doc on the deepweb. Is that true?

If a buyer does the deal outside of the platform they wont have the protection from the arbiter is how i think it will work.  So if you are stupid enough to forgo this protection on a deal you should except a higher risk of being scammed.  
Ebay is like a nanny state which protects buyers but not sellers.

Mysterious cover but what inside? Nothing, no facts.

The real effect is down the road a little. Like much of the recent news. The next few years will be good

I like this product, but I'm skeptical.
What prevents a malicious third party from simply copying/cloning the Helios NFC and brute-forcing the encryption, which would likely have a short password since it must be typed for every payment? 
I'd rather lose credit card information than wallet information, since I'm not liable for credit card fraud if reported in a timely manner and Bitcoins are tantamount to cash. By using existing credit card technology I suspect you've opened yourself up to all of the advanced scams that the much larger market for credit card fraud funds. Everyone has a credit card, therefore everyone is targeted for credit card fraud (skimmers), which I suspect would be equally effective on Helios. If you had developed your own dedicated technology then you would have bypassed this threat. Few people will have Helios cards, the potential targets will be sparse and unidentifiable, therefore nobody would seriously invest in Helios fraud.
I suppose you could argue that a wallet clone could easily be rendered useless assuming one address contains majority funds and defaults to sending change funds to a new address, but once Helios data is identified as profitable it's a short step to automatically and immediately emptying detected wallets. Again, short password due to repeated manual entry =&gt; short brute force =&gt; quick and profitable theft.
I wouldn't personally mind having the password stored on the phone to bypass manual entry, as long as it does not also contain the encrypted wallet.

this is the dis-information you will always see.
such as government health advisers of the 1950's telling people that smoking is good for your health
such as government health advisers of the 2010's telling people that fluoridated water is good for your health
such as banks telling you that buying a share that does NOT change, is a good investment.
think about it. if it does not move then the price you buy at is the same you will sell at. meaning you wont make profit to keep up with inflation.
the real story is that they dont want normal people investing for profit while they themselves cannot secretly use your funds for their own portfolio.
ys there are risks, but putting a $10 bank note into a bank in 1990 which would have bought 12 loaves of bread. can now only buy you 4 loaves of bread, even after yearly interest that banks offer you, you may get 5 loaves of bread.
invest $10 in bitcoin in 2009 you can now cash out $1million. (5 loaves of bread becomes 250,000 loaves of bread)
invest $10 in bitcoin september 2013, now you can cash out atleast $40 (4 loaves of bread becomes 16 loaves of bread)

Well that's obvious. In 2010 it would have been less people... and in 2016 as adoption grows there will be more people... an interesting study/forecast into long term consumer choice about Bitcoin would be largely speculative and incredibly complex but more useful.
