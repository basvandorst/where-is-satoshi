Consolidating meaning into character glyphs is what humanity does best. Having non English characters represent something makes it universal. It's why we all recognize  Instead of writing hash Everytime. Consolidated code, meaning, and makes it universal for people who don't read English.

You'd think. But here I am. When you're on your own, it's harder to get started in life. Everytime I get to comfortable place with money, a Rainey day fund going, the car gets a flat, or the cat gets sick, or it's too slow at work to make a good commission check. And then I'm short rent by $100 and I'm scrambling to make it up by ubering or something, then someone throws up, and the cycle repeats.

This is good advice, but this bandaid system of plugging holes only works for so long. There's a crazy mass population of the states that are growing poorer each year, we should move to a universal system, so everyone is taken care of. Studies show preventative care reduces the costs of medical expenses, we would all be healthier if we pooled healthcare together.
