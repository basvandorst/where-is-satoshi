I am a Greek American who uses Bitcoin and has close ties and family in Greece. I also visit Greece regularly once or twice per year.
Greeks are not ready for Bitcoin. Greek people are still hesitant to use credit cards and make purchases online. Greek people do not trust and embrace technology like Americans do. Most transactions in Greece's economy are still performed via cash. The culture in Greece is a long way from adopting something as revolutionary as Bitcoin. 
Last time I was there, a little less than a year ago, nobody I spoke to in Greece was interested in Bitcoin and only a few had heard of it.

My best attempt at ELI5:
If the block size is increased based on number of transactions as you suggest, a malicious actor could flood the network with transactions to increase the block size. If this happens, nodes with less resources(bandwidth, memory, disk space) would be at a disadvantage and some may not be able to handle the increased size. This is what people mean when they say an increase in block size reduces the decentralization of the network. 
Increase in block size -&gt; theoretically more resources to operate a node -&gt; only those entities with adequate resources can contribute to the network

No. The verbiage in the Constitution that pertains to gold and silver does not protect the freedom of citizens to use them as an alternative. In fact, the US government outlawed the possession of gold over a certain amount in 1933:

Price is set by market perception, not inflow and outflow of cash. If nobody is willing to sell an asset at a particular price level, and people are willing to buy at that level and higher, the price will increase. There can be a very low volume of trades at a very high price, and that would become the new market price, which could represent a massive gap upwards, even though very little money exchanged hands.

In any economy, how do you prevent insider trading?

You are correct. Bitcoins have no intrinsic value just like fiat currency. A bitcoin at its core is a string of characters that comprise a complex mathematical equation. The intrinsic value of a bitcoin is the value of these characters. Bitcoins and fiat have value because of their utility but they have no intrinsic value.
EDIT: just to expand on this a lot of people seem confused about intrinsic value. The best example is gold. If the whole world used gold as a currency then suddenly stopped, gold would still have value because you can make jewelry out of it, it can be used as a conductor, it is used in medical applications, engineering applications, and more. If bitcoin stopped being used as currency, what value would it have?
