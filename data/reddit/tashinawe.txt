Same at 14, the rest at 18- all during a spike I thought was ending in the stratosphere. Tough morning today no doubt. Still gunna HODL, but not buying the dip out of financial objective to not buy more than I can lose safely. Just know that you’re not alone. Don’t panic, buy the ticket, take the ride

It’s people like you that can win a Super Bowl when they’re down 28-3. I can’t relate- but stick around. For the rest of us.

Will someone with a soothing voice record this and post a link? I’d like to fall asleep listening to it please. Less risky than the martini/bong cocktail I’m currently using to stifle my fears. Thanks.

I will happily kneel at the entrance for said big boys to enter and scuffle in behind them with my pittance of btc in a leather pouch

It’s fun when you are staring at the tracks in front of you clearly seeing the rise to come

Just called the 888 number launched this sept (found just googling). It said they couldn’t supply support in a timely manner and to visit their site and disconnected. No way to wait in line or leave any messages. If there’s any other number or a better time to call you know of I’m all ears. Thx

What’s interesting here is I hadn’t uploaded my ID or any proof of ID. Had only enter d bank info to create initial transaction- then began the id info for the local currency wallet and got through about 4 bits of info before being emailed that it was closed. So the ID tip is good for the future but not what happened this time- any thoughts? Could it just be over hugged because if today’s surge?

Good advice on switching next time. It didn’t ask for more ID info during set up so i assumed it was ok to do afterwards - that said- good info on ID details. My DL has a different address than my current mailing/billing address (it’s still my parents place since i move a lot). Is it best to use that address? My bank is linked to my current address though. Any way to make that work?

My account is locked now and the phone number will disconnect after a message saying the volume is too high and to log in for support. Emails are of course bounced back. Anyone know a way of contacting support or how to resolve? The page said I had to close account to ensure funds would not be frozen but I could not close and now am blocked.

No. Just opened a Coinbase account today and invested 1,000 US.  Was told bank transfer would be complete in 3 days and my price was locked in. Upon adding more info to add a local currency wallet I received a message from Coinbase saying my account was deactivated for dangerous activity and now I cannot log in. Now the site is saying they are having too much traffic and any service requests will not be returned for up to a few weeks. 1- will my money be invested or not? 2- how do I re open a wallet? 3- what the actual fuck

Gotcha. What about if it doesn’t match with my attached bank’s listed address for me- not a problem?

Also it’s daughter ;)

Absolutely. I also keep getting notification texts with 7digit confirmation codes but I only used the first one to verify my number initially- am I getting other people’s codes? Who knows.

Any advice on where to find a phone number? I sent a message in the contact submission after none of the automated answers were of any assistance. Also- excellent gif
