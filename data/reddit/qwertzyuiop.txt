Sorry, but there's no way to recover the 0.03 BTC, it's likely already distributed to miners.
Consider it a cheap lesson, in the past [people have given away hundreds of BTC this way](

Yes, your hot wallet has generated a new key pair for the change. You should be able to see it if you look in your list of addresses.

[How's this?](
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:57:54
Just guessing here, but I think it's set up this way deliberately.
If the ATM could pull as much BTC as it wanted, then a hack or an error could cause a large amount to be lost. This way, a human has to see that it's still working correctly before giving it more BTC to dispense.
Even Mt gox claims to have been brought down by a "leaking" cold wallet like this.

Did you make the transaction for 0.005 BTC?
If so, the leftover 0.4949 BTC may have been sent to a [change address]( different to your original address but also belonging to you. 
There's no harm in having your BTC spread accross multiple addresses, in fact addresses are designed to be single-use. But if you're concerned, you could send the entire balance of your wallet back to the original address.

It's possible that higher transaction fees will have to be used to incentivize miners to include transactions in a block. This will be especially true if a block size limit remains in place, and transactions have to compete for space to be confirmed. (Although I imagine in a situation like this most transactions would happen off-chain.)
In reality, though, I think it's impossible to know how the mining industry will look that far in the future. It would have been difficult to predict in 2009 what it'd look like today, and the gap between now and 2021 is even larger. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 22:08:14

It was the beginning of the transition to bits that caused it. Everyone likes to be tipped 300 of something, nobody wants to be tipped 0.0003.
It seems to be mostly confined to redditors at the moment, but with redditors also tipping on twitter, YouTube etc.

It'll show up as unconfirmed within seconds of the transaction being sent. Sometimes sites take a little while to do payouts.

It's not insignificant.

You could make a transaction sending a nominal amount to the address, and also to 1This1sAnExamp1eMessage... 1TheQuickBrownFoxJumps... and so on. You'd have to work out a 5 or 6 character checksum for each address but that takes seconds.
@_date: 2014-11-08 13:35:20
I think large mining farms will actually become more prevalent, and individual miners less prevalent. The network will always reach equilibrium, so as it becomes less profitable to mine, miners who aren't profiting will drop off until only those who can profit at the difficulty/reward level are left. It's easier for farms to profit due to economies of scale on their equipment and cheap electricity costs, so they'll be left at the end. I don't think it's anything to be concerned about, I imagine there'll be enough farms that the network will remain decentralised.
Of course I might be completely wrong. With ASIC technology becoming cheaper and more energy efficient, it's possible that a lot of people will run small miners just for the sake of supporting the network, without the hope of ever profiting. Maybe far in the future, every home computer or even router might come with a tiny miner built in that'll run unnoticed in the background using a miniscule amount of power. That'd keep the network truly distributed.

Not including the version number and checksum, an address is 160 bits, which works out at about 30 characters of Base 58.
You could embed a longer message by sending coins to multiple addresses in the same transaction.
@_date: 2014-11-22 00:29:28
No, the only factor that limits speed is the speed of your ASIC/GPU/CPU.
At this point there's little point mining on a home computer. Without an ASIC you haven't a hope of turning a profit, even with one, the cost of electricity is normally greater than what the miner generates.

I don't own one myself, but I looked around and it seemed to offer the best hashrate for a cheap USB miner. A Google search didn't throw up any suggestion that the company was dodgy, unlike some others we could all name.
Amazon has them for sale, but we'll hopefully be able to get them a little cheaper if the group buy goes ahead.

I'm not familiar with it. It might be best to send the whole balance back to your original address or make a new backup just to be sure.
There's probably an option to 'use change addresses' somewhere that you can turn off to stop this from happening in the future.

There are multiple correct checksum words for each set of 23 words. Each word is 11 bits of entropy so 23 words only gives 253 bits. A 24 word private key contains 256 bits plus the 8 bit checksum, which means the last word must contain 3 bits of entropy as well as the checksum, so there will be 8 valid last words.
It's probably best to generate a key by making a random 256-bit number, adding the checksum to the end (first 8 bits of the hash of that number), and then not converting to words until you're finished.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2014-11-09 02:37:51
Each address has a different private key. 
What wallet are you using? Some wallets only generate new addresses as they're needed, meaning your previous backups won't be able to recover the address with the 0.4949 BTC in it.

No reason Coinbase needs any more outgoing connections than a single-user node, they're just relaying valid transactions. I assume Coinbase doesn't need to act on incoming transactions until they're confirmed at least once, so the number of incoming connections is unimportant, unlike blockchain.info for example, who would have a few hundred incoming.

It's impossible to find the private key for a given address.

They'll never succeed in blocking everything. If they started blocking ports or IPs used for servers, server owners would just publish new ones. If this game of cat and mouse became too much for users they could just run their own nodes instead - with blockchain pruning enabled this requires only about a gigabyte. If they start blocking port 8333, other ports could be used. As long as the internet is functional, bitcoin will exist.

Nodes (which maintain a copy of the blockchain, such as computers running the bitcoin core wallet, armory, btcd etc.) communicate with each other over port 8333, and are typically connected to tens of other nodes. They relay new transactions and blocks to each other. I'm not too sure how nodes find each other, but I believe it involves scanning the internet for other nodes, I believe nodes share IP addresses of other nodes with each other, and I believe if this fails they can default to hardcoded IP's.
Bitcoin clients which are not nodes (e.g electrum, multibit, mycelium etc.), which are what most people use, connect to servers (which are nodes) which allow them to check their balances and push transactions to the blockchain. Web wallets also work this way.
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:34:09


[Careful now](
If you want to speed the transaction up, you can use a thing called child-pays-for-parent, where you make another transaction that spends one of the outputs from that transaction, with a large enough fee to cover both (try 0.0005). In order for the second transaction to be confirmed, the first will also have to be. 
AFAIK Eligius is the only mining pool that supports this, but they have 5% of the network, so they should find a block every ~3 hours.
@_date: 2015-07-14 18:33:13
Yes, though it'll be quite a large transaction (in bytes) so it would need a decent transaction fee.
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:59:52
There's a spam limit of 540 satoshis, or 5.4 bits. Anything lower than this won't be relayed by the network.
@_date: 2015-07-20 02:16:08
I'm not sure about ports, there may be differences between clients.
In electrum, there's a long list of servers you can use, I presume it's either hardcoded or fetched from somewhere. Mycelium relies on a central server which is a terrible idea as it recently went down.

Afaik, using 256-bit private keys was a standard, and the code would already have been tried, tested and secure. There would have been no point rewriting it for 160-bit keys, and deviating from the standard could have caused vulnerabilities.
