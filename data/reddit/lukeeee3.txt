Good point. But you are forgetting few things.
They are taking money only from "weak hands " who are gone by now (besides traders).
And second, there is limited number of bitcoins.
They may scalp range, or play trends but at the end, they will have less btc, which makes it harder to manipulate the price. Distribution is crucial here and I wont go there. 
Thx for the reply! I wish to hear moar from you.

Money doesnt dictate your life if you can cover life expenses. What you do with other hours in day, that makes a difference.
For example putting one hour a day towards creating your business makes it 365hours a year, what equals more than 2 months of working hours. Put 3hours a day toward your goal and you will have business in 2 years, i can assure you that.
Or just open a beer and look at those few few others, who have the grits and consistency.

Ie: if there is big enough difference arbitrage happens and price is stabilized somewhere between bitmex price and other exchanges?

Explain how bitmex moves the price. As far as i know bitmex is zero sum game and liquidations move only bitmex price not "exchange" price

Supply will lower and the price will double if demand stays the same.
This is good, so hashrate can grow making network more secure.
Tbh, i guess big miners have 2cents/kwh so if u do your math, there is plenty of room to grow for hashrate.
