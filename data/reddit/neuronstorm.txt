I just checked them out for an intel 730 SSD I was thinking of buying.. they're about $50 more expensive than I get them here in Australia.  Are newegg usually a bit pricey?
Just checked another drive.  $254 on newegg - but I see them locally for $150 to $180.
Newegg just seem ridiculously overpriced.. and that's before I even add shipping.
Why do people buy from them?
edit: product links given in my posts below.
Not sure why the downvotes. People don't believe me, or is anything not super-positive simply downvoted around here??)
I was just surprised and trying to understand why their AUS store has significantly higher prices even before applying shipping. It's not that I get things particularly cheap here in Australia.
@_date: 2014-07-01 11:17:42
Intel 730 240GB - $275.02 AUD - (292.80 with shipping)
I see though that the US price is $216.99  
At current exchange rates - that should come in at under $230AUD - so why the price hike for their AU site?

I went there with my fiancee last night for dinner &amp; drinks - and we were the first to pay with Bitcoin :)
The food is top notch &amp; the service was excellent and friendly. It's a tiny place though - so make sure to book. We ate at the bar because there was a function on upstairs.
We chatted to one of the owners, Amir, and he was  enthusiastic about the future of Bitcoin, saying he intended to keep some of the takings in Bitcoin rather than convert it all to AUD.
The checkout process was using BitPOS, which was smooth and easy. They just use their phones to bring up the payment interface.

All up - I'd be a lot richer if I'd only backed the winners.

It was a lot of work reading/researching though.

You don't need the blockchain in order to sign a message with a private key (which is basically what a payment is).
I expect the user interface in bitcoin-qt won't let you send a transaction before you're synced - but you should be able to export one of the private keys that has enough funds.. and import it into an online wallet.
I don't know if fiddling around with the console and exporting keys counts as 'quick' - but it's doable.

Once you have some Bitcoin - beware of investing it into the various Bitcoin stocks.

Sad to see such an obvious troll-story in a tech publication.
Forgetting the hamfisted 'spooky' embellishments and the obvious dig by having the perp as a 'kid' -  Bitcoin mining doesn't take a lot of bandwidth.

Well things can always go a little bit backwards.. but this is more like a major software change than a mere update. 
I'd expect a few bugs for a major upgrade - but in this case I don't think they've even done enough consultation with people who actually use the software. Even without the bugs - it's less intuitive, and less useful for anyone who does a reasonable number of transactions.
@_date: 2014-03-25 02:27:57
While it's true that a properly created paper wallet can't be hacked - you still have to be aware of possible gotchas during wallet creation.
e.g the printer you use may store a copy on its internal drive.
Also you should do some checking of the code you use to generate the wallet,   possibly using your own offline copy, or at least use one that the community generally recognises as safe.

Yeah - while I think it's plausible they had significant losses due to automating the transaction retries, it seems unlikely that they lost enough to put them in a serious hole.
At around 3 to 1 goxcoins to realcoins - it certainly seems worth a punt to me, and I've hoovered up a lot.
Yes, there's a small chance that their BTC accounting was so bad that they topped up their hot wallet multiple times from cold storage because they were under the mistaken assumption that the current hot wallets were not empty - but just in some sort of locked state. 
I just think they have terrible PR skills, and will muddle through.
@_date: 2014-10-23 22:54:39
We will then get ignorant statements like.

My feeling is that they could handle the loss of their hot-wallet, but there is a small risk that their BTC accounting was so mucked up that they didn't realize the hot wallet was empty.  They may have assumed that the hot-wallet was merely inoperable due to a bug, and so it's possible they kept bringing in more from cold storage just to get things flowing.
That's a worst-case scenario though - and I'm personally betting on them being able to pull through.
@_date: 2014-06-29 23:08:23
"The Bitcoins are put in cold storage and only a hot wallet is used for withdraws"

I don't think it's so much being shady as just sucking at communication.

While some see "where there's smoke there's fire" - I see FUD, trolls, bad-PR - and a buying opportunity.
I could be wrong - but hey - it's worth a gamble.

In the past I've tried to maintain an address which represented a pool of available funds by sending the change back to the same address - but of course this is 
a) tedious

c) Slows things down if you need to send payments in quick succession.

Neo &amp; Bee seems like a great way to invest in a Bitcoin business that is not just about mining.
It's still risky and speculative of course.. mainly due to possibly adverse political decisions - or just the fact that the odds are often stacked against new businesses being successful.
I love that they're targeting the general populace with a serious marketing campaign - but at this stage I have no idea if the average Cypriot will really be interested or understand what they're doing. Despite the general mistrust Cypriots seem to have for banks, they may just not be ready for the leap to Bitcoin, even wrapped in a user-friendly service with physical branches.
Still.. I've taken a punt and bought a bunch of NeoBee shares. If they can pull this off, and branch into Greece as a next step - they'll be a powerful force for greater Bitcoin adoption.

For more context:
RBS invested in at least one ponzi scheme, Bernie Madoff's - to the tune of around £400M - with further related losses due to lawsuits apparently in the billions of £.
RBS has been fined hundreds of millions of pounds for being involved in Libor rate rigging.
RBS traders have been caught covering up trading losses (at least one trader even getting jail time.. wow, someone actually called to account!)
RBS bankers were involved in criminal tax fraud in the film industry.
RBS has been accused of 'alice in wonderland' accounting practices and 'finessing' its results regarding the eurozone crisis.
They've been 'hacked' too - with 9Million USD in ATM theft in a single incident with RBS worldpay (and doubtless other events)
Up to 2,000 customers have been the victims of fraudsters who targeted RBS's Get Cash phone app
The Serious Fraud Office has been  'looking into whether RBS systematically defrauded companies by forcing them out of business'
RBS has been involved in mis-selling Payment Protection Insurance (policies people could never claim on) with a potential compensation liability in the billions.
But you know.. that's all just 'business losses' for the traditional banking system.. right?  
But hey.. the taxpayer will cover it - so these 'minor' incidents are no reason to lose faith in their management :P
'hacking', 'fraud', 'theft', 'poor accounting' and 'mismanagement' in a single entity are cause for shock &amp; ridicule of the entire Bitcoin industry - but what, it's just costs of doing business for normal banks even though these things occur globally and not just at one or two banks?

First try it out with really small amounts until you're familiar with the process of going back and forth with paper wallets.
Yeah - you should probably get in the habit of treating the paper wallets as single use. I usually 'sweep' a paper wallet to a new address (unless I'm in a real hurry to spend it without waiting additional confirmations). There are a few things to think about when using them. e.g if you just imported the key without sweeping, then left the paper around unsecured because you assumed it's empty.. it could still give access to some funds.
If you have an android device, either blockchain.info or the mycelium wallet are good choices with private key import facilities.
I usually keep a couple of copies of paper wallets. You have to figure out what you're comfortable with as far as number of copies and whether they're password protected etc.
If the only password is in your head - not going to do your family much good if you snuff it suddenly.
@_date: 2014-09-05 10:55:12

A possible solution is wallet software which tracks your losses and gains as you spend (and as you acquire bitcoin) - and bundles it all up into a nice report for tax time.

Sounds totally wrong to me.
The split probably means each unit will be trading at roughly 1/15th of what they're currently trading at.  
Also - my understanding is that each new share equals only 1GH instead of the 15GH a share used to represent.  This means you're getting 14GH for each 15GH you previously held.
That is the price you pay to be rid of the 'loan' which has been dragging on the dividends.

It's pretty clear the authors of this app don't actually use Bitcoin day to day.
A chronological transaction history is vital.  This is such a step backwards.
I have over 130 unarchived addresses in my wallet, and it's now incredibly difficult to find any recent transaction.  I see a notification that I received a payment - open my wallet - and I'm none the wiser as to what it was.
I go out for a night of drinking paying with Bitcoin - and the next day I can't see how much I've spent.
Truly awful update.

Well.. some of the goxcoins are still available to buy on bitcoinbuilder at a heavy discount - and there is still light trading going on.
Those goxcoins which were already sent to bitcoinbuilder are tradable - obviously other 'coins' on gox can't really be traded.  I think it's only a few thousand that are tradable there anyway.. so yeah, it's still close to 750K that can no longer be traded I suppose.
I guess the buyers are still punting on there being something available - but at around 0.06 real BTC per trapped goxBTC; after recent revelations, the price seems pretty steep even if you don't mind a gamble.

I watched Bitcoin slide from $30 to $3 amid widespread negativity and held..  I also bought some more when it was down.
That your particular flavour of copycoin/overkillcoin is currently down in value isn't the problem in itself - that's just going to happen sometimes.
The problem is that most alts serve only to attempt to duplicate the 'wealth creation' aspect and most people in the altcoin herds are ignorant of the massive battle in PR Bitcoin has fought tooth and nail just to get this far.. even in winning over parts of the tech community - let alone the general public.  
For example the immutability of the 21Million limit was a tough concept to get across. There is/was deep suspicion from even semi-technical people that this could be changed... that there is some sort of shadowy controller who could just 'flip' it to something else.
Having finally (or mostly) got the message across about how immutable this is for Bitcoin - along comes dogecoin playing fast-and-loose with their coin cap - and worse - doing it effectively by decree from what amounts to a pack leader. (Yes - I know it wasn't actually a code change - but the publicly declared limit changing is the same issue)
We had to argue tirelessly that the 21mill limit wasn't going to be irrelevant due to a thousand copycat clones making the *effective* coin cap of cryptocurrency limitless. 
This was largely based on the idea that Bitcoin has a big enough head start and momentum and a core of devited enthusiasts &amp; developers who were building real infrastructure that couldn't just be duplicated like a software project.
Along comes dogecoin and shows that you can get a pack of people to drool over an infrastructureless phenomenon and publicly urinate over every Bitcoin thread they come across.
It seems they're oblivious to how their cheery '..and dogecoin too!'  interruptions to serious attempts to sway merchants; are damaging.  
Dogecoin is impressive from a marketing and social/viral standpoint.  It's a shame it wasn't simply implemented as a wrapper around Satoshis as then it could have enjoyed the use of all the existing infrastructure without hurting it so much. (though we probably have the mining difficulty and sha256/scrypt mining divide to thank for the proliferation of new chains)
If doge maintains its social momentum - then presumably the infrastructure will gradually come too... at least on the software side - though it remains to be seen if it'll ever attract the sort of infrastructure that Bitcoin VCs are beginning to fund.
Back to your question.. people didn't know I was going to get Bitcoin before I did - and when it was going up - they kept saying - 'oh.. wish I'd bought earlier - but it's too late now'  (ie at $20/BTC &amp; $100/BTC)
When BTC prices go down.. some of my friends/family have bought a little.. but many seem to think each dip is 'the end'.. or else they just never get around to it.
I just can't seem to get interested in springing even 100Million satoshis to get what.. roughly 1 Million Dogecoins...  even though I've thrown hundreds of Bitcoins into other risky ventures... so perhaps the way I view Doge is similar to how many outsiders view Bitcoin. 
I personally wish you good luck - though I think investing-in/promoting dogecoin &amp; other non-innovative alts is a potential road to a tragedy-of-the-commons which impoverishes cryptocurrency  through dilution of focus, and trashing of previous PR work in getting people to take Bitcoin seriously.
I hope I'm wrong though ;)

I think real 'moon' valuation would be around where the average person in an average developed economy and holding 1 bitcoin would feel somewhat privileged.  ie - the equivalent of a respectable savings account. 
I'm thinking.. say USD $50,000 equivalent. (in today's purchasing power)   
I'm not certain it will ever get there, but if it did - I'd be comfortable saying "wow.. Bitcoin really did go to the moon!" 
For now.. all this moonspeak is just fun &amp; giggles - and half-jokingly self-mocking about how optimistic some of us are about this thing :)

The 9BTC were combined with 9 other amounts (the other input addresses in the last transaction) - totalling about 35.46BTC.
This total was sent to 3 different output addresses. (one of those might be a 'change' address belonging to the sender, or they may all be to different 3rd parties)
It doesn't really make sense to say the 9BTC went to the 35BTC output just because it is bigger.. it partially went to the 0.4 &amp; 0.02 output too. I guess you'd say it's a sort of proportional mix with the other inputs.
This is where the concept of 'taint' comes in. (see the 'taint analysis' link for that address)

goxcoins started selling at bitcoinbuilder for only a small discount. 
Many of those who bought there wouldn't have an average acquisition cost anywhere near as low at 10%.. even if they bought a few that low towards the end.
I suppose it's possible a few people only started buying once they were heavily discounted - but those who thought mtgox was actually likely to come good, probably jumped in earlier than that.

I think there's a small chance that there is/was initially something to distribute - but a large chance that whatever is available to distribute will largely be eaten up in legal &amp; administrative fees.

It's not a matter of some minor updates. They've failed at a higher level than that. They completely screwed up the concept of a transaction log.
By forcing transactions to be categorized by address - they've made it unusable for anyone with more than a handful of addresses.

"Can you imagine if other areas of banking worked that way?"
But it does.
Sometimes an ATM will just eat your card, or the merchant will hold it because it is flagged for some reason. This happens completely out of the blue.. and means if you don't have cash or another card handy - you're stuffed.
Just this week my girlfriend's card was taken (a new one will be mailed) by staff in the bank branch when she went in just to make a password change. The staff said the card was flagged with 'contact issuer' - though they couldn't say exactly why, and they actually *were* the issuer.
 
So - not only can you be double billed for things on credit cards, you can get fraudulent charges - and sometimes they can cause your card to be flagged and snatched at inconvenient times by machines, merchants or even when you walk into the branch of the issuing bank!
If you don't actually do the work to complain/report double bills or fraudulent charges - guess what... you'll usually end up out of pocket.
So.. it's unfortunate to see similar things happening with Bitcoin - but even though there's no 'bank', I think the vast majority of these issues can be sorted out satisfactorily by the customer reporting the problem to the merchant or the payment processor.

Assume exchange rate of $500/BTC.
Take $500 - buy 1BTC from non-gst registered local, or from OS.
As a GST-registered business, you can now buy business supplies to the value of $550 from another Australian GST-registered business who accepts bitcoin.
(since you 'supply' that 1BTC to your supplier and swap GST invoices with the same amount of GST)
It evens out in the end when you submit your BAS - but you only needed $500 to pay a $550 GST inclusive invoice. It's like you get your GST credit instantly.
Now whether it's practical is another matter. You have to be able to acquire Bitcoins from individuals or from overseas without paying GST, and you also have to do the ridiculous invoice swap when you spend it - basically the same as barter is treated GST-wise.

A consumer walks into a Bitcoin-only bar.
He walks up to a Bitcoin ATM and pays cash for enough BTC to buy 2 drinks.
Bitcoin crashes 50% before he gets to the bar.
Under the old rules - he simply lost 1 drinks worth of value. 
Under the new rules - he's recorded the acquisition cost of his BTC in his tax-aware wallet and the loss at purchase time. 
So although he now can only buy 1 drink at the bar - he has a tax loss equivalent to 1 drink which he may be able to use to reduce tax payable at the end of the year.

No - the business would not end up paying 20%. The merchant just *charges* an extra 10% when converting to fiat. i.e receives 10% more fiat which it then gives to the government - and only if it doesn't sell the coins using an overseas Bitcoin trader.  
If the merchant exchanged via a local intermediary payment processor - the payment processor would then have an input tax credit - and whether they onsold their coins locally or GST-free from overseas - the GST inputs/outputs would even out. (Although it has some potentially annoying cashflow/exchange risk implications for such a processor)
If the merchant exchanged their BTC to fiat via say an on-premises ATM - then they'd have to charge 10% extra fiat.
Clearly - the effect of this would be that a *consumer* using BTC would be taxed twice... but only if they acquire their BTC from a local GST-registered entity.
Under such a regime, Australian exchanges, merchants &amp; payment processors would find it harder to sell BTC to local non-GST registered entities (i.e consumers) - as presumably those who really wanted BTC would either mine it or buy overseas to avoid the GST. 
I guess the effect would be somewhat negative on the Australian Bitcoin industry - but 
a) it would not mean the merchant is taxed twice 
b) it would not mean the Australian Bitcoin-paying consumer pays more than the standard GST at the till or checkout page.
I think if the AU gov did this - it would be revenue neutral for them, as it would only raise money from non-GST-registered Bitcoin buyers who chose to buy locally... and presumably most wouldn't.
Any local bitcoin exchange business who was 'supplied' bitcoins by a merchant - would pay 10% more to the merchant in fiat - but if they sell it GST-free overseas, would get a refund cheque from the government. 
Anyway - that's my take. Let me know if you see any holes in my reasoning.

But how does this protect from confiscation?
If the Cyprus government issued an order to Neo to freeze all accounts - and then to 'haircut' x% Euro from each account and hand it over, (perhaps requiring NEO to convert BTC to Euro to make the payment)
..then wouldn't they have to comply?   How is a BTC denominated account any safer than Euro if it's being held by a company which is physically in Cyprus?

"receivable within the US"
I'm sure that's fabulous for you.. but I don't see that instant payments within some particular country's borders are either unanticipated - or threatening to Bitcoin's raison de'tre.
Yes - existing financial systems will eventually get more efficient and provide faster services, which may decrease interest from some who are well-enough served by their national currencies and institutions.
For those who think Bitcoin needs to 'take over the world'.. (and soon!) I suppose I can see why this would bother them.. but otherwise, yeah a centralized system can be faster... so what?! Optional fast centralized systems can and will be built on top of Bitcoin too, to serve you if that's your thing.
The raw underlying system doesn't have to outcompete on every metric.. especially when Bitcoin is a more flexible 'platform' on which a myriad of services can be built.

It's highly improbable that by mistyping 2 letters, you stumbled upon a valid bitcoin address. 
This means that despite the ANXPRO system telling you the transaction was processed - it probably wasn't - and ANXPRO should be able to help you by manually crediting your account. (because it's unlikely their system sent the money anywhere)
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:33:01
You certainly can.
Some wallets have a pretty poor UI. e.g If you're distracted while hitting the send button, you can refocus and there has been no audio or visual feedback that send was already pushed and the transaction is going through.
It's more of a problem when buying drinks for bitcoin at a bar (after a few!) - but I could see it happening in other circumstances.

I'm Australian - and my impression (from running bank accounts at a couple of different Australian financial institutions) is that 'most' payments take a day or two. 
Even though as a consumer you might feel that credit cards are 'instant' - in my minor experience as a merchant - the actual crediting of the funds to the merchant is again, delayed by days at least.

You need to find out what mechanism your friend was using to convert that phrase to a private key.
You could try brainwallet.org and see if the public address given has any Bitcoin value in it (by entering the resulting *public* address into blockchain.info)
Anyway.. be a bit careful about where you enter those words. I believe brainwallet.org to be reasonably safe - but you might want to investigate a fully offline method if you're paranoid.
Once you have the private key (probably a long string starting with 5) you can import it into some bitcoin wallet software and then sell it on an exchange.  (Or you might be able to use a tool provided on the exchange to import the private key directly e.g MtGox has this feature)

It's always worth mentioning, because it's surprising when someone sends their entire wallet balance somewhere and finds the destination balance different. It may be a small amount, but the users might see a nice round balance in the source wallet and some fractional amount at the destination.

Competition from those currently running the financial system. ie Banks getting their act together and 
a) staying open 24/7
b) providing fast cheap international transfers.
c) low fees, competitive interest
I see a lean mean banking system as a possible threat to Bitcoin adoption.
If they see the threat from Bitcoin, and decide to just compete by providing better service than they do now - many ordinary people just couldn't be bothered switching to something new.
Ok.. so this wouldn't actually 'kill' Bitcoin - but it'd possibly keep it as a niche phenomenon.

BTCGarden seem to be taking the 'go big or go home' approach with a bold IPO of 4 Million shares sold in 2 tranches.
They've now sold 1 Million shares - or roughly 1.6MUSD worth.
This will give them a much bigger warchest than Labcoin or ActiveMining.
They also have a provision which allows share dilution (under strict circumstances).
This is actually a smart move, as it means they will be in a strong position to raise more capital if needed to push ahead with a future-generation technology.
I think the sheer scale of what BTCGarden is doing, and that they're doing it in China - means they could dominate the other new players. 
I suspect they needed to go large to have a chance to catch up with AM.

A hash function is a one way operation which converts a chunk of text to some really long string. 
e.g when I use the sha256 hash on the text "SomeBlockOfTransactionsETC"
I get:
When you mine for bitcoins, you're doing a hash of a big block of text which includes the current set of transactions that have been broadcast on the network (as well as a reference to the previous block so that it forms a chain).  You perform a hash like above (which is a really fast operation for a computer to do) and look at the result.
The result needs to begin with a certain amount of zeros in order to make it 'difficult'.  That's what the mining difficulty adjustment is doing. When mining difficulty goes up - it says that for everyone to agree you solved a block - there need to be more zeros at the beginning of the next hash result. 
So basically you tweak an unimportant part of the block - create a hash, see if it starts with the right number of zeros... keep trying millions or billions of times per second.
e.g - I hand tweaked my example above and found that
sha256 of "BlockOfTransactions111"
=  c64f8dc6051a967d6e8f731acdfc0edf89425eca3b99d219f3c32ccdda0efab1
no good.. for this example we've declared the current mining difficulty to require a single zero at the beginning to be a valid result. try again.
sha256 "BlockOfTransactions119"
= 029d882e8338e8428e5ec0480a817c735778cfb61b6e2839d120898c10278b81
Yay! A leading zero satisfies the current 'mining' difficulty in my trivial example. We've solved a block.   It only took me a handful of 'hashes' to  find one.
When miners create the block text that they are trying to hash - they also put in the payment of the 'block reward' to themselves ie currently 25BTC as well as transaction fees.
So - it's basically a hashing race to add another valid block in the chain. No point trying to cheat, because if other miners and network nodes don't agree that your block followed all the rules - it'll be ignored and you wasted your computing work.

Unfortunately - some services require you to set withdrawal/control addresses which aren't always a snap to change..
e.g picostocks (no idea how to change withdraw addr), btct.co (30 days wait to change locked withdraw addr!)
Also - various group buys etc may require you to 'sign' proof with a particular address which may now be untrustworthy.
just-dice is easy enough to change the emergency withdraw addr - but you need to actually perform a withdraw from just-dice to change the standard recorded withdraw addr.. so  it's a bit inconvenient.
Friedcat's ASICMiner shares are controlled (and divs paid) by a particular address which you need to check if it's now compromised.
All up - this could be quite a pain if you use a lot of services and have been paying via your android device.
I've archived a lot of addresses - and will have to 'unarchive' some when/if I need to sign with them..  but I guess I really need to contact each operator and 'sign' a request to use a different address as soon as possible.  
Ouch.. not just a pain for me - but a really big hassle for the operators who may now have a huge number of change requests to process :(

It's much easier with Bitcoin to pull your funds back to somewhere completely under your own control.
Also - there are new features coming in Bitcoin which allow 'multiparty' 'm of n' keys.  By distributing the key, any one datacenter raid won't cause the coins to be lost. Hopefully services at risk of raiding will take advantage of this.

I don't protect the gain - I protect my state of mind by thinking for the long term.
My strategy is to ignore the dips and wait.... or buy some on the dips if I have spare dollars.
Occasionally I'll sell some or buy things with Bitcoins during a big  run up in price.
In short - I don't get too attached to the current price as a measure of what value I'm holding, and I'm mentally prepared to weather big drops.
I remember the long slow slide from around $30 to around $3...  it was painful - but I held and bought because I believe in the technology.
Similarly I wouldn't lose a grip on my coins if there was a sustained slide from $400 to $40.
Some traders may be able to protect and increase their holdings by selling before they 'lose' too much - but I'm no good at predicting when trends reverse, so that game's not for me.

Blacklist trackers are inevitable - unless something like zerocoin gains enough traction to make them impractical before they even start.
We can't stop people (esp regulators,governments) building these additional layers - but we should probably fight to at least keep it out of the protocol itself, and if possible, the reference client.
I expect that unless we get true anonymization via widespread use of a system like zerocoin - then various address blacklist databases will arise - and eventually merchants in certain jurisdictions will be forced to subscribe and act upon the lists. Once large merchants do that - it will be in the interests of consumers to use 'blacklist aware' wallet software.
A future of multiple blacklists and a combination of confiscation &amp; taxation at the points of sale in order to mark the coins 'clean' seems to me to be the direction regulators will take us.
The alternative is presumably a truly anonymous blockchain - with the risk of regulators being able to point to terrorist acts/assassinations/kidnappings as an excuse to *attempt* a complete ban.
I don't know if a middle ground is even possible.

You don't *need* a separate bitcoin wallet - but it's probably a good idea. Generally it's not advisable to leave coins in the hands of a 3rd party.
Try the wallet here: blockchain.info/wallet  and make sure you enter your email address to back up your wallet.
The blockchain.info system is nice because although it acts like a hosted wallet - they never actually have direct access to your coins and you could recover your money even if the blockchain.info website were to disappear.
(Basically your wallet is an encrypted blob of data they store, and only gets unwrapped on your computer when you enter your password)

A user could prove they sent an amount by 'signing' a message using one of the addresses they sent the amount from.
'signing' is a feature of many wallets which allows you to enter some arbitrary text (e.g "sent by MR x") and create a garbled-looking piece of text (the 'signature') which you can verify could only have been created by the person in control of that bitcoin address. (verifying a signature is also a feature in various Bitcoin wallets)
This address 'signing' feature is often used by people to prove they sent funds.. but can you explain why you'd want it for donations?  When I've tipped/donated I've never cared to identify myself.

Whilst the 10 minute figure may be somewhat arbitrary - It's probably more robust in terms of resolution of network splits and large scale network connectivity degradation.

Buyers want to jump in ahead of other buyers, but don't want to drive the price much higher. 
Sellers want to jump in ahead of other sellers, but don't want to drive the price much lower.
Sometimes whole dollar amounts act as psychological barriers... so for example someone might put in a sell order at 114.99 because they're just guessing the price won't quite hit 15. Basically it's just people guessing what other people are doing, and possibly being impatient about it.

The first local merchant I looked at seems to have the worst bitcoin policy I've ever seen.  It's insane. It'd be better they just didn't accept it.












































Forgetting refunds - This is not even a 20% fee - it's a 20% worse exchange rate - which works out worse.
e.g an item that might cost you 1BTC elsewhere - wouldn't cost you 1.2 BTC here  - it'd cost you 1.25BTC
x/x*0.8 =  1.25X
So.. you pay 25% more.
If you were to request a refund an hour later and the bitcoin exchange rate hadn't changed - you'd get back only 1/1.2 = 83% of the *base* price.
ie 0.83333 BTC
Pay 1.25 - get back 0.8333  -  lose 0.41666.
That's a 33% fee for your refund.

Is a return from a previous transaction made in your mtgox interface.
Don't expect priority service though - as this isn't any fault of MtGox or satoshidice. 
As the satoshidice 'read this warning first' note says:
"Only use wallets that allow you to receive Bitcoin from the same address you sent from. If you're not sure, test with .001 Bitcoins. If you get nothing back, then your wallet is not compatible."

I've sold in Sydney a few times.  All went smoothly. Some used devices such as laptop or phones, one just brought a paper QR code for me to send to (We confirmed by looking at tx on blockchain.info). Some buyers want to use the localbitcoins site as intermediary for the transaction, others are cool with direct transfer.
They've all been easy going people - I've never felt uneasy, although a few times there have been jokes about how sus it looks handing over wads of cash and/or envelopes!

Putting my really paranoid hat on... OP could be someone who has compromised a machine upon which they found evidence of a 400+BTC brainwallet - and is attempting to get the owner to panic-shift the coins on the compromised machine so the transfer can be intercepted. (via any one of various means: copy-paste buffer hack, keylogger, script which sees the private key when they attempt to move it but is fast enough to spend it first).
Anyway.. paranoid hat off, and back to taking the OP at face value - good on you.  If it were my wallet - I'd throw 10BTC your way for the honesty &amp; help.

As bbbbubble pointed out - people have coins in cold storage which don't move for years. e.g Casascius coins. Even if you increased your 'inactive' period to years - it would suck to have to destroy the holograms on coins you intended to keep for decades.
Also consider brainwallets, which might be used by people who have been unfairly detained/jailed.  After being wrongfully imprisoned for 20 years - it'd be a double whammy to lose the bitcoin stash ;)
I made a related proposal that extremely old coins might require a higher fee to reintroduce to the network - thus reducing the systemic impact of a huge old stash being dumped on the market - because it could only be done slowly.  Even this idea was received poorly by the Bitcoin community.  I think people like the current simplicity of the rules - and any change would have to have large benefits which most participants understood in order to gain any traction.

You've missed *a* bubble.  It's reasonable to suppose there could be more  price volatility and over-extension in future.
You've also missed the golden opportunity for mining with CPUs &amp; GPUs.
Now we're at the tail end of viability for mining with specialized FPGA rigs and coming into the age of the ASIC miner. Either way - getting involved consists of outlaying a fair sum on hardware that isn't useful for general-purpose computing - so it's definitely speculative. Many say that you may as well buy Bitcoins directly.
"bitcoins are dead"??  sounds like something Wired magazine would say. 
e.g in 2011 they titled an article "The rise and fall of Bitcoin" and stated that: "the bitcoin never got back above $17".  Well now it's above $17.
I predict that there will be many more people incorrectly proclaiming 'bitcoin is dead'.  What they actually mean is.. they haven't bothered to understand it or where it's going. 
@_date: 2013-01-14 01:47:00
Not quite.
The left is *declared* demand the right is *declared* supply.
It's better thought of as representing buyers' and sellers' rough intentions only - as there usually remains much money in both Fiat and BTC that sits on the exchange but not on the orderbook.
A flatter curve on one side does indicate that a large order or two *could* drive it rapidly in that direction, but it depends on how quickly manual (or even bot driven) orders pile in - for or against that momentum.
These graphs do tell you that at least that much money exists on the exchange - as orders without the funds to back them don't display - but when the action happens, it's not always in the direction the orderbook suggests.
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:01:18
If the US dollar crashes or becomes highly volatile - I expect people would start referencing it more against the Euro or some other currency. If the Euro and other currencies are also in turmoil - it would probably be traded in terms of gold/silver.. or even other commodities such as 'loaves of bread'.  At that point presumably more things would start being priced directly in BTC anyway.. so perhaps people would start thinking of 1 Bitcoin = X months average wage etc.

Yes, every miner (well.. actually every pool and solo-miner) is trying to find a hash for a block which will most likely contain a slightly different transaction set to those the others are trying.

It's semi-optional, in that you can often put through a transaction with zero fee and it will eventually go through. By attaching a small fee, your transaction is likely to be mined sooner. As Narmotur pointed out - ultimately fees will make up the only reward miners get, but by that time there will presumably be a large number of transactions occurring daily so hopefully competition between miners will keep the fee relatively low.
The fee also helps the network by making it impractical to spam/attack the network by sending tiny amounts back and forth rapidly.
@_date: 2013-01-14 01:50:50
The other phenomenon to account for is rapid 'pulling' of orders from the orderbook as the price approaches their declared position.

Wired had better have a very thoroughly audited system of destruction - or they're providing the potential incentive for someone on staff or (some malicious code on their systems) to surreptitiously copy those private keys and spend it years down the track. 
Bitcoin has a beautifully transparent way to prove they've sent coins to some worthy cause - yet they choose to just declare they've not kept copies and have us believe it?

The EFF is having a 'chilling effect' upon Bitcoin, as bad as we could expect from any poorly-drafted legislation which causes people to curb their own activities and speech, based on fear. 
I believe there are many within the EFF who are interested in Bitcoin and its potential, but overall, they are oblivious to their hypocrisy and the damage they are causing.
It's one thing for the EFF to avoid Bitcoin due to their own *unique* role in legal advocacy - it's quite another for them to so incompetently word their stance that for other organisations; it acts as a driver towards abstention from such a freedom-enhancing technology.

Investors want a return, and if any such 'connections' to government agencies become known due to their over-enthusiasm for data collection (hey.. nearly everything 'leaks' eventually) ... then this becomes a liability to the investors. They are competing against a huge pool of other investors who operate without such 'connections'. 
In short.. no, I don't worry it about it 'too much' (but I'm not exactly apathetic about it either). 
Society needs to be vigilant to keep overzealous politicians and regulators in check - and hopefully there's a balance that will ultimately be slightly in favour of the masses - so long as there is a core group of technologists who can stir the masses out of their apathy every now and then on the critical privacy/freedom issues.

My understanding is that you just have to pay your 'capital gains tax'.  
(Which is payable when selling assets such as real estate, shares, managed funds investments etc)
I suppose if you mined and sold regularly, it might reasonably come under income tax though.
For someone buying and selling Bitcoin on a regular basis through various channels as well as spending some directly - this is likely to be quite a headache to manage. 
Theoretically, purchasing goods/services directly with Bitcoin would constitute a gain(or loss) which should also be recorded for capital gains purposes. 
If people/businesses really want to be compliant - there may be a case for wallet software to calculate some of this.  I guess one could do it retrospectively by examining your own tx history and historic exchange prices, but somehow, with or without assistive tools, I think it'll be very few people who go to the full effort to be compliant.

They may for example be able to record for later analysis,  where (at least approximately) certain transactions are first broadcast into the network.
Unless you're using Tor (and perhaps even if you are), then that sort of capability just has to be factored in to your decisions about how you use Bitcoin. 
Generally, I don't think most consumers are too fussed (rightly or wrongly) that various governments might have a fair chunk of information about their spending habits - so I don't see it as either a major driver to or away from Bitcoin - unless we see some more serious attempts at capital-control around the world (e.g the sort of credit-card taxation that the Argentinean gov has been applying)

I thought you meant the same parties as in the 2011 feld.com article ... I can't find the references you mention there.

btradeaustralia.com is another option.  Their rate is sometimes not quite as good as coinjar - but if you do a cash deposit via NAB, I believe the fee is reimbursed (as bitcoins) which brings their rate to about the same or sometimes even slightly better.

I didn't find anyone wanting to buy.
Not very 'all over it' eh!?
In fairness though.. I didn't get to speak to everybody. 
Hopefully soon we'll have a Sydney 'Satoshi Square' going :)

Last week's meetup was fun. I also went to the monday meetup in western Sydney, where we could buy pizza and drinks with Bitcoin.  (But it's so far out I drove and so didn't take advantage of the beer!)
I'm sure a lot of us would love to have meetups in a more central part of Sydney where we could pay in BTC. Does anyone know any candidate bars in Sydney we could encourage to get on board? Surely someone knows a bar owner we could convince of the joys of being mobbed with coins.

Yeah, I guess a frivolously acting 'rouge' employee is some sort of paid clown.... or an old hooker wearing too much makeup?
Well at least they're not rogue rouge employees - that would be terrifying.

ordered jalapenos in July 2012 - received June 2013.
They work nicely.
I'd order again if I had a *reliable* indication of how long it would take to ship units.

More like around 15BTC each about a year ago I think.

"Once the video has been shot we have decided to ship the device to conman who in my opinion develops the best Bitcoin mining software available"
To conman eh?   Is this a thinly veiled insult to jgarzik for having received the first Avalon?
This posting is just too ridiculous.
I'm expecting to soon see yet another 'hacked' announcement.
