damn I could finally start up my bitcoin business with only a dozen of those bitcoins! kudos

It costs money for stores to transport their cash securely. Especially ATM owners etc. Obviously unless bitcoin eliminates cash completely these services will still be needed to some extent but it reduces the liability and perhaps the amount of trips needed etc. Bitcoin does indeed help reduce the risk this link shows.

I haven't had any issues with coinbase's paper wallet feature.

Early in the morning you can catch their live chat support online sometimes. Try that route too.

Proof? last I checked owning an exchange doesn't mean you are manipulating prices.
The order book looks no different from any other exchange using XPY.
I will be happy to report someone if there is substantial proof. 
But to be honest telling people to report someone for something they have no clue about without educating them is just stupid.

Well.. If you think about it, it can make sense. The problem is Russians can't exactly use bitcoin for everyday expenses it's not that mainstream yet. As ruble loses its price the cost of certain goods can't lower in price to match the devaluation of the Ruble which means people who invested in Bitcoin are needed more Ruble for everyday expenses so they are selling their bitcoins. 
If bitcoins were expected by most stores they would have a lot more incentive to keep their bitcoins and just use those.
edit: Also just wanted to point out that this article is still rubbish, there is no sight that THIS is going to cause a crash in Bitcoins value.

If they ever did integrate BitCoin they need to offer a 1-3% discount when purchasing with it... which they won't do... because there is no discount when people pay with cash. But even then bitcoin is more convenient because they don't have to secure that cash in the store and run it to the bank etc... I dunno  any integration would be great but people need to start offering motive for people to switch to it.

Honestly what rubs me wrong is when you can donate without providing that information at the actual location but if you want to donate through the interwebs you are "obligated" to provide more information. 
It flicks my ears when I see that an email address is *required when filling out some forms such as ordering a pizza... of course I make an email up but my initial reactions to these kind of things is if I can go to the store and buy a pizza or go to a charity and donate cash without providing those information why can't i do it over the interwebs.

Making a circle account was a bloody headache for me... but after I finally got everything authorized and working it is pretty nice but their limits are worse than coinbases. 
I think Circle has great potential but I'd go with coinbase to start.

Would make all the smearing going on a little less annoying if this is true. A confirmation would be excellent.

LMAO I don't fiddle with the XPY much but anyone can make accusations and threaten with "proof" the fact these Trolls spread FUD with NO proof is proof its all BS.

Hey thanks, been working on SEO for the site but my buddy is headwaying the entire thing I have been following Reddit for a long time and just wanted to get an account set up and start contributing to the community. Still got to learn the rules for this type of community but it's been really helpful.

I agree. I wrote a post why I felt Bitcoin &gt; WU however that does not mean I support trying to deface them. I personally think we need to wait until we can send bitcoin anywhere and have it easily converted into fiat currency. Once we can easily do everything WU can do then I honestly don't think I would have a problem with trying to let the public know that there is a better alternative.

Good thing I bought extras when it was sub 500!

I'm not pro WU however I think it is rather harsh to say they skinned the most vulnerable people in the poorest countries.
They made it possible to transfer money from one country to another, without them it wouldn't have even been possible to get money to those in need, I fail to see how they are skinning them?
Sure they are making money off them but let me ask you what's worse? Not helping people transfer money to those who need it. Or helping people transfer money to those who need it for a fee? Would you rather be able to transfer money to someone for a fee or not at all? seriously... 
HOWEVER I do not tolerate WU trying to destroy Bitcoin do to the fact it's competition. But of course anyone wanting to make some money is going to try and run out competition. 
So I think your second paragraph is harsh and incorrect but I agree mostly with the rest.

I think this is a pretty accurate guess IMO. I mean if I ask myself and all my friends and pretty much everyone I know who are into bitcoins right now they either found out about it by a friend. Or researched alternative methods of sending money internationally. I mean the vast majority of the public haven't been introduced into bitcoin. Look at what the price did with the few millions of people that have started to use it! Wall street has been waiting. Lots of big players have been waiting. Speculating the dangers, the regulations. I think 2014 allowed those big players to see what they needed to see. Now that regulations are starting to exist 2015 we see more big players and we see 2nd half 2015-2020 mass adoption. Mark my words.

Yes I have..
I have always used coinbase without any problems however last week I needed to get some bitcoin quickly and circle is instant. I am not verified enough with coinbase ( I do not own a Credit Card only a debit card) to get instant transactions. So i decided to make a circle account seeing as it's suppose to be quick ( with a debit card anyways )
After I tried to attach my card it said the same thing you are experiencing so i waited and waited then sent an email and they told me the same thing you said it was flagged by the fraud prevention system. what they didn't tell me is they sent an email requesting a government issued foto ID to verify my account.. So i did that but the system kept telling me the picture didn't pass because of a list of things but the foto ID did fulfill all the reasons it could have passed so it made NO sense to me. 
Sent them another email a little pissed off at this point and within 2 hours they said my account was good to go. Their actual service is nice but it was a headache to get verified.

Would love to see a Toyota dealer here in AZ accept bitcoin! Congrats.

Someone who has an idea if their "reserves" are held in fiat meaning they would have to purchase the BTC to reimburse anyone who was affected. I don't follow bitstamp but i assume their reserves are in BTC and they will just use those if they reimburse anyone for that matter. 
Bitcoin investors literally have to put the trust in the exchanges hand.
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:38:55
yay the bulk of the bitcoins are safe.. meanwhile BTC tanked and everyone who has invested in BTC lost money. This does not help anyone want to buy into bitcoin.

This doesn't change the fact probably 90% + of their users don't care and will still use them. Unfortunately the people who do care about this change is the minority. And a % of the minority care for illegal reasons.

You are joking right? They openly admitted they were compromised. The addresses were tagged and the price goes down the same time 18,000+ coins get re routed to a random person? Yes it does appear that was the case. 
but if you want to be naive and pretend that 18,000 missing coins and an exchange being compromised has NOTHING to do with the price decline be my guest.
