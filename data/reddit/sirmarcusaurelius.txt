Our cells need a coordinated centralized blood supply, lymphatic system, etc. They do not each connect to one another - they all connect to the central circulatory system that they share. But, if you turn up with a cable in-hand at my house, explaining that you are connecting your house to 50 million different houses across the country, I will listen. It seems fantastical and logistically impossible to me, but who knows.
Edit: I will also be curious to hear how you get all that cable across everyone's properties with their permission.

Nice cherry picking at the duration. Who has a long-term investment for a MONTH? Look at 6 months MINIMUM.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:37:45
Yep. Many people value a little convenience (not having to move exchange) more than degrading the entire system. Selfish.

You read it in a strange way - it said: if you have a friend that uses coinbase, help them stop. You read it as: I will be your friend and help you stop using coinbase. Where did I call myself a friend to you?
Edit: downside or not for you, you’re harming us all by clogging up bitcoin. Since you are talking a lot about being nice to people, how about YOU think for a second about whether that piece of convenience is worth the damage you are causing as a user

Haha because of THIS, you're going to keep using Coinbase??
If you make financial decisions because of reddit etiquette, you have bigger problems than continuing to use Coinbase. Good luck to you - I recommend not making any big decisions because you saw a post with off grammar or they weren't polite enough for you. Jeez, I am glad I am not depending on your decisions for things in my life.

"And yes, this means making our own internet technology."
I hope you don't really believe that we have to setup an entire new internet to everyone's home, because that is ridiculously difficult, resource intensive and requires centralized coordination, which literally runs counter to what you said.

Ok, you're clearly a little slow as you cannot connect Coinbase with Bitcoin. I will leave it here. I do not care about classifying you politically. You are clearly not very good at drawing connections or are desperate to rally against net neutrality but still like bitcoin. Either way, we're done here slow boat.

I first bought at 800, then added some more at 1,200. A week later, it dropped back to 800 and I thought I'd stupidly bought at the peak. Thankfully, held.

I also thought that Blockchain had responded to that concern: np.reddit.com@_date: 2017-12-02 23:54:59
Possibly. I don't know if Exodus draws on Blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:14:59
Also, you've had issues of your own ("Unfortunate indeed, I sent funds there. What to do?") judging from you comment history.
Edit: also, I notice that you didn't comment on my remark about fees removed before conversion (i.e., wasting your time on the other stuff). VERY telling
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:10:08
Okay, thanks for your valuable contribution. I took the time to provide multiple sources and bring them together. I am no longer using Exodus - I left the comment purely for others, who can choose to take the advice, or not. You have heard the concerns, so if you choose to carry on despite that, then that's on you. To paraphrase you, I assume you're indeed arrogant and that Exodus is problematic. You're ignoring others left and right. You seem to be a very annoying person overall and probably, not much fun at parties.
I actually am pleased you're continuing to use Exodus. It might end up teaching you a valuable lesson. Bye!
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:19:37


Absolutely. And reputation (which is the definition of collective opinion) is also defined by the bad, as well as the good experiences. I have brought together some bad experiences from a group of independent people. You can probably bring together good experiences from a group of independent people. And people can make their own mind up

k, bye edgy troll
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:44:30
Yes, you can pick and choose a source that does not understand how that works. You can also pick a choose a source that does. Cherry picking isn't contributing much. But more generally, shy of people's memories being wiped, it's not rocket science for people to compare their balance before and after they make a transaction. Yes, some people will do something stupid and their balance will not arrive at all, but we are not talking about transactions not going through here. That would be obvious. Bitcoin users tend to think that everyone else in the community is a complete moron.
It sounds like you don't use Exodus, so thanks for your (random) input, I guess?
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:16:03
Well it's up to you. Personally I would do that or move it to an exchange that you use (for only a few days while you're waiting for Ledger obviously), but your call
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:32:44
Yep, there we have the true you - calling people a ‘retard’. Hopefully you’re just 17 and being edgy but I suspect not and you’re just a toxic person.

Jesus, the arrogance of some people. First, you will see a bunch of people who know what they are talking about in the comments. Second, don't assume that dozens of people are incorrect. Yes, there might be a few reasons in there, but people keeping records and matching them against their current balance is pretty straightforward.




They have responded to other questions quickly. Whenever this comes up, there's silence (when mailing them)

Hardware wallet’s an option (and recommended by most anyway)

That’s what you get for being on Coinbase. If recent events hadn’t convinced you to move exchanges, it’s kind of on you.

...I literally just gave a dozen posts over the last week from reddit - that was the bulk of my post here
I am sure they are wonderful people. I included a bug (not malicious) as a possibility and someone else in this thread thought it might explain another bug that's spread recently (though just correlation).
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:01:30
Actually, no - the blockchain can still be completely accurate because an amount is taken in fees, etc before the conversion (and then a smaller amount will be converted that expected). So, we can look at the blockchain and say "looks good!" but in reality, they sent/exchanged 1 bitcoin, they expected 0.95 to be converted because of 0.05 fees, but actually 0.93 is converted.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:14:04
Huh, corruption? Who said corruption? If you read my post you would have seen that I also mentioned a loophole, bug, or weakness as a possibility. I would suggest you re-read it, but I'm not holding my breath.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:26:50
Great! I'm glad my post helped at least one person avoid what I/we went through.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:38:33
Interesting! Wouldn't mind setting some of that up myself.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:56:23
Well you can give them a choice - new pair of gloves or this?
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:48:20
Yes, I didn't want to waste my time. In short, the blockchain can be completely accurate when additional fees are removed before the conversion. The transaction is completely fine on the surface, but it involved slightly less money than it was supposed to.
But, hey, if you want to go ahead and use the wallet despite all these experiences and warning, then all the power to you. It's not a cost/benefit analysis that I'd make, but you do you.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:26:29
Oh, interesting. That's definitely a possibility. Someone with better coding skills than mine would have to look into that.

Why do you think he looks so fed up?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:32:03
Not as trusting? Why does that matter? What can they do? It's not like telling someone your bank balance gives them your account numbers and passwords. It really doesn't matter.

Says the person who just said they recommend it to their friends and family. At least keep your BS consistent
And for the record, a lot of this post-dates the display bug
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:47:00
Sorry, you do not understand how this works. The blockchain keeps a record of the transaction, but some fees are deducted before it reaches the blockchain, so the blockchain transaction can be perfectly correct, but an incorrect amount can end up arriving compared to the amount sent (minus expected fees).
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:48:42
No, has happened since that release, and on systems that are completely updated.
And, even if the people storing currency on light wallets are "not worth their salt" and "nubz", it doesn't mean they deserve it. Get some compassion in your life.

It doesn't help that your friend chose the most expensive wallet available. Other wallets are much cheaper

If you’re going to invest, do your research - you have years of posts here. Look at the top posts on the coinbase subreddit alone. You don’t have to live through something to learn

People have said exactly that for centuries. I'd love for it to happen, but I've heard it said (about lots of different things disrupting political structures) so many times before. Unfortunately, human nature (greed, power, etc) is strong
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:30:31
Well, with this bitcoin cash debacle, it now looks like this was a blessing in disguise - I guess I should say thanks to coinbase for pushing me away. Because I now have claimed my bitcoin cash and sold some of them.

Would love to. But they randomly closed my account and now won't let me withdraw my bitcoins. But let me guess, it's my fault, right? Good luck getting sympathy when they randomly screw you over in the future (I look forward to saying "use their services the way it was intended")
@_date: 2017-04-14 17:25:41
Plus, this logic is so terrible: "they are so busy, with so many customers, and so much profit. If only they had enough to invest in more customer service agents". Ummm if they are doing super well and have customer support problems, they are not investing enough in their customer support - too many champaign celebrations, not enough reinvestment in their company
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:08:40
Tell them that it will rise with time. You don't buy a stock in Google, see that it dropped 1% the next day and scream and stomp your feet. You know there will be natural variation. With bitcoin, the variation is just a little more than normal. Tell your relatives to get a grip.

mustyoshi's wasn't, fool
@_date: 2017-04-14 17:23:57
So, if they simply never respond to my e-mails (or to other people's e-mails) what does that mean? You're just saying "that's how it is." No, no it's not. In other industries, people would have decent competition and would move away. You can say "it's been fine for me", which is great, but if multiple people (including me) literally get no reply from them, what are we supposed to think? "Oh hey, it was great for barefooter, so I guess they're a great company afterall and I am just unlucky. Oh shucks."
I am getting kinda sick of these coinbase shills who think that because they've never had a problem, the company must be fine.
@_date: 2017-04-14 04:29:09
What's the name for getting no response from their customer support e-mail? Literally, none, after several attempts and weeks?
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:57:41
Thank you - this is really informative and useful! Do you know if there is a group I can support that are in favor of a system that regularly updates block sizes? (Or is this just technically implausible). If cryptocurrency explodes as we hope, even 8 MB will one day look tiny. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 17:29:52
Also, what am I supposed to do with the never-ending "waiting..." spinning symbol when I try to transfer my bitcoins? Serious question - changing the destination address does not work, it's something on your end. I'm literally cut off from my bitcoins
@_date: 2017-04-14 19:47:07
I didn't either for many months. Someone else said it perfectly: "It's fine until it isn't". Their interface is decent, so if everything is routine, you're set. For me, they just randomly said I violated their terms of service (who knows why - I did nothing unusual) but won't let me transfer out my bitcoins (and of course ignore any e-mails)
@_date: 2017-04-14 17:27:35
If Rosie the Robot, sorry customer support rep, really is excellent, why does she give out an e-mail address that no one replies to? - This is an actual question (please don't tell me to e-mail support for the answer)

Uhh yeah nothing says "positive" like showing crypto users in scary white masks like an episode of Dr. Who.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:50:27
Why are you putting it away? Why are crypto folks angry at one company but when it comes to the big banks, giving them a pass (no pitchfork). Shows that crypto isn't really about "Changing the system"

A lot of exchanges are effectively giving people a choice (at least for the trades after the fork), so with a finite sum of money, the value of BTC will fall by whatever percentage BCC is chosen
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:32:03
I wonder how many people who are casual bitcoin investors will check on their bitcoin early August and wonder what the hell happened to their investment. I suspect a surprisingly large percentage of bitcoin holders are "just in case this thing explodes" investors rather than people who follow it closely.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:25:05
But I am guessing it would suck for the bank. I mean, if 80% of customers pulled their money out of Bank of America, the bank would be in big trouble - needing to have cash on hand instantly.
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:21:26
Thanks to everyone for helping us non-experts understand all this. My exchange (Kraken) is saying that "Clients holding Bitcoin (XBT) balances at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) - e.g. 1 XBT will result in 1 XBT + 1 BCH"
So in practice, is this the same as if I just transfer to a paper wallet? It sounds like the same outcome...
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:30:05
