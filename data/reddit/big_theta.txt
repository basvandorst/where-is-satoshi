Solid attempt, but let me ftfy.
We need 40 bits to create the signature.  The probably of any contiguous string of 40 bits being the signature is (1/2)^40, or roughly 10^-12 .  We would need about 5.5*10^11 strings of 40 bits before the probably of such a string containing the signature becomes 50%.  40 * 5.5 * 10^11 = 2.2 * 10^13 bits or 2.7 terabytes.

Yeah, wouldn't count on all the people who replaced our jobs with robots to give us free money for being unproductive.

Which things aren't mutually exclusive?

You're missing the point. Craftsmanship will only sustain so many jobs. Labor follows the laws of supply and demand just like everything else. If everybody is trying to become craftsmen than everybody is going to get paid shit.

I reject this idea, and I'll tell you why. The problems with homelessness are more than just "they don't have houses". Many suffer from mental illness or other issues. Just putting them in houses isn't going to eliminate the need for social programs to provide real help. We give people free housing, its called the Projects, and they're usually pretty terrible. Without education, mental health and medical interventions you just wind up with all the symptoms of homelessness in houses. I'm definitely not opposed to housing the homeless but I think its shortsighted to think that it wouldn't still require a significant investment to deal with the root issues.

Exactly! Please see my original comment.

Its not your fault, I read that study you're talking about. That's totally what they claimed. But they assumed that, "if you put them in houses, crime and social issues associated with homeless with disappear." So, its them I disagree with.

I don't think i implied that the two had to be exclusive. My point was, building houses doesn't remove the need for social programs.

Did Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerburg, or Warren Buffett replace their work force with robots?

[There isn't a rule of economics that says "better technology makes more better jobs for horses." It sounds shockingly dumb to even say that out loud, but swap horses for humans and suddenly people think it sounds about right.](

The truth is, leadership's refusal to invest in reimplimenting legacy code is what necessitated the use of XP to begin with. It's not IT's fault. IT has probably been warning them for years. But executives don't understand the problem because they didn't see any consequences before and they heard, "it's going to cost money" and thought, "share holders aren't going to like this."

So are you like autistic? Or are you seriously not aware that you sound like a giant asshole? Your answer could have been two sentences, and just as effective.
