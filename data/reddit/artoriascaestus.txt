Do people even trust them though?

They never really ask. Most know I've been mining for a while and I never mention how many coins I hold. Mostly they just tell me to make sure I cash out enough at certain points that I'll survive if the bubble pops. I do that anyways though. I'm not putting all my eggs into crypto no matter how much I believe in it.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:17:06
I did a bit further research and it doesn't seem to be affected but I'll use mine for lunch today to verify. I am kinda hungry. Haha
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:41:56
And I still can't even get them to explain to me why they keep stripping out my verification info and refusing to accept it when I reupload. Going on 4 months now.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:44:32
To proof of stake from proof of work. A method of confirmation that requires less power cost and gives returns to validators but punishes those that attempt to introduce bad blocks. Off chain is literally the same as lightning network. And there there is sharding which will allow for different "universes" or chains that are tied back to the main one that hold specific data in order to keep the main chain from getting bogged down by worthless data while still maintaining the same level of security and transparency as the main chain. On top of that, there is already more functionality built into the protocol but less "anonymity" if bitcoin addresses can even be referred to that still.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:56:37
One of many reasons Bitcoin has surged in popularity even if acceptance has stagnated due to instability and fees.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:28:41
Sharding, moving to PoS from PoW, off-chain transactions, etc
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:04:33
I'm still waiting on them to stop randomly deleting my ID and blocking buys on my account. I contacted them in November and they still haven't even responded.
If not for the fact that I require them to use my Shift card, I'd have long since dropped use of them. At this point I don't even bother buying from them (since I can't anyways), I just use Gemini.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:30:03
Yeah, litecoin at this point is just a testing grounds for new btc features
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:10:20
Here's hoping. Mine worked as of yesterday.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:07:45
Shift cards are still functional though, correct?
What caused these to all get cancelled?
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:26:56
My coworkers and family keep saying the same thing and I ask why they are sorry. It's not like I've lost anything. I got before the price drop and I haven't lost anything.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:43:07
I thought people were using Monero for that these days?
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:47:15
To save myself time on the specifics for sharding this is a good place to read up.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:50:07
Ehhh... My grandma can't use cellphones so that metric doesn't work for me. I get what you're saying and agree completely though.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:35:22
Yeah, they've been doing this a few years now, right?
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:15:24
So they're good again now huh?
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:34:02
Toshi honestly reminded me a lot of Line when I used it. I was wondering when Line would get into the game with this.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:06:02
I just checked them out but it doesn't seem they offer services in my state yet. :/
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:40:59
I fall into this category.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:57:58
Hindsight is 20/20.
You could have sold for more or you could have held on indefinitely. I don't regret spending any of mine to buy games or whatever.
But I agree with the core message of never getting rid of them all. Be careful with your savings guys.

I'd honestly prefer Bitcoin to be constantly steady in price rather than constantly hitting new highs. Would make it more usable for me. Although I'll use it either way in all honesty.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:06:23
Any idea what all states they actually provide service to? Seems my state isn't supported by many people.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:47:53
Wait, I have bitcoins?
SELL SELL SELL
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:21:53
Just means I'll get better USD-&gt;BTC exchange rates.
I'm ready!
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:43:48
Not if you bought it at $0.10USD
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:17:25
I legit just bought Nioh with some of my coin all of a week ago.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:03:32
Thanks for the heads up. I ended up created an account with them and now am just waiting to see if they approve my verification or keep throwing it out like Coinbase.
Seems CEX.IO doesn't work where I live. :(
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:17:09
Been doing that for a month or so now. I notice little difference from prior.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:28:42
Hopefully same goes for me. I'm floating at about 24 hours with them still verifying right now. By the time it goes through I expect bitcoin to have hit 12K and I've been waiting to get more since it dipped to 8K like a week or two ago.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:52
Parabolic more like
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:24:58
Thanks fam.
Good looking out.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:47:02
Yeah it took me a second to see what was going on there too until I checked the dates.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:45:59
Yes please. I won't spend them all this time. I promise.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:42:23
Or you could work 40 hours a week in order to learn more about the things you are interested in and grow as a person so you can pursue your passions.
I work as a net tech and love every second of it. Plus one day I will become a net admin which would be even better.
If I wasn't getting paid to do this shit I'd do it in my free time anyways.
@_date: 2018-05-25 17:11:28
Doesn't BTCPayServer effectively do the same by remove the middle man in general?
@_date: 2018-05-25 17:07:39
Only real issue I have with it, that caused me to stop using it was that it didn't play videos correctly in many places due to codec licensing issues or some shit.
@_date: 2018-05-30 21:09:11
Oh nice, so this will be effective for more than just Bitcoin then, correct?
@_date: 2018-05-01 16:04:51
Newegg, Microsoft, Overstock, Subway, KFC, Green Man Gaming, Valve (until a few months ago due to major volatility), Expedia, Dish, HumbleBundle, Mint, Playboy, Wikipedia, etc.
Need I really list more?
@_date: 2018-05-25 17:19:42
This is the best shit I've read all day.  
You are the blockchain masteruuuuuu

My coworker sent this to me yesterday when I told her she could pay me in bitcoin for servicing her macbook.

When did they join the Linux foundation again? Like one year ago when they started to utilize the kernel to power their own Azure platform since they noticed Linux makes up a majority of the server marketshare.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:46:54
Agreed, more than content with mine. Occasionally I've noticed there are issues if I try to use it online, but in person at a store I've never had a problem.
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:48:52
That's what it seems to be.
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:16:17
Lack of proof is proof to the conspiracy theorist.
The burden of proof is reversed with them.

Since when? I was under the impression that a private seller could accept largely whatever they want to satisfy a debt within the United States. Obviously I don't think a trade for contraband would be allowed, but crypto doesn't quite fall into that territory. Not to mention, the IRS already has tools to perfectly track and peg crypto possession and gains. They largely just seem to hate if someone makes money and doesn't give them a piece of it.
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:01:17
Proof of corruption still doesn't prove a theory though. Otherwise we could just say any crazy thing is true because "tha gubmints covering it up"
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:09:11
Not to mention Ledger doesn't properly handle derivation paths for Ethereum last I checked. I omit's the change portion of the path unless they recently changed it.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:48:18
I'm still locked out of buys and have been for the past 10 months. They don't respond to any support tickets or PM's. I wish you luck man. I've moved pretty much all my business over to Gemini cuz their customer service is so shitty.
@_date: 2018-04-02 22:47:19
Those are the only two banks with branches local to me beyond the bank I'm currently with, sadly. And my bank is a pretty small one and doesn't support Apple/Google/Samsung pay which is part of why I'm looking to potentially swap. I hate carrying credit cards with me and since I can't pay in crypto for everything nfc payments are a decent alternative for me for now.
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:18:43
What does Newegg count as?
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:34:36
People wanted to up the blocksize but the majority of the community didn't so the community forked or split into different pieces.
There's the original community and then the bitcoin cash community. Many people take issue with the cash community because they try to sell themselves as the original bitcoin when they are really just a splinter group that isn't compatible with any of the new changes like lightning network.
If you send actual bitcoin to a bitcoin cash wallet it will be lost as well which is another reason many people take issue with them not referring to themselves as bitcoin cash.
