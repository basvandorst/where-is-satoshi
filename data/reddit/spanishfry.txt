android only? is this an app for peasants only?
@_date: 2019-07-31 16:47:56
so what did the mechanics of these trades look like?
@_date: 2018-09-15 14:15:33
we got a badass over here
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:24:23
sure, but first let me file this massive loss from Gox since you want to be so thorough taxman.

You've got a future in journalism
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:23:46
some of us were not allowed to withdraw our trading btc/funds before this went down.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:00:39
you injected law enforcement and government investigation.  what is being demanded is blockchain evidence and 3rd party investigation, which could all come from within the community.
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:26:04
is it paranoid to assume the irs will use the apostilled copy of my driver's license that gox demanded?
eta: not that is matters cuz goxxed
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:07:46
yes, the incentives are fubar.  assume for a second that gox regains control of funds:
a. tell people you recovered funds and lose hundreds of millions
b. tell people funds are lost and keep hundreds of millions

thanks for providing rational discussion to this series of unfortunate events.  it is much appreciated to have differing opinions and the ability to back your claims with evidence.  have an upvote and keep doing what you're doing.

hey family sign up for this thing that hopefully isn't gox.2

I went through it with Bitfloor and eventually ended up fine

SHOW US YOUR PAPERS!
(hi res scans pls)
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:09:20
what deposit method did he use?  from U.S.?
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:39:54
i understand, what i'm explaining is that traders didn't have that option and gox froze some of our accounts in the weeks leading up to this.
@_date: 2015-05-19 00:21:04
but that is benefit to the user - a repeating payment for having the phone on.  
that could facilitate complex issues like universal income for a billion people.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:03:58
from the blockchain. up until very recently lots of people bought btc on gox and successfully withdrew them to their wallets.
@_date: 2018-10-27 15:37:04
Hahahahahaha! Final price.  This guy.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:32:16
Thank you.  I just transferred by coinage to stamp just in case there were shenanigans.  Should've left it in my wallet 
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:57:41
Buy some now some later.  Dollar cost average and you won't be waiting on the sidelines 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:07:35
Even on the delay you still lock in at that price, you just get those locked in coins put into your wallet in 5 days.  Patience grasshopper 
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:51:03
uhhh so if i have some bitcoin pre-fork, where is my BTH?
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:26:18
thanks dude v reddit sucks
@_date: 2015-07-08 23:13:23
is this like giving a pregnant woman a box of condoms?

"We are still waiting to hear back from the bank regarding our remaining account balance."
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:01:42
this account is fake or compromised.  His info is wrong and the so is the amount of information.  No way bitfloor or Roman would post this much.
@_date: 2013-04-18 12:49:00
thanks. both of those fit under wonked.
@_date: 2013-10-07 20:20:45
that hurt
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:28:33
any updates on your situation from your lawyer?  I'm surprised there aren't more people talking about this, it seems most of the discussion is days old.
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:14:55
same. submitted verification info day before, still not approved.  no updates since 4/20.  
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:03:57
If you're waiting on USD withdrawals of funds currently in bitfloor, what are your expectations about receiving your money and when?
@_date: 2013-02-17 22:23:27
what is the best chance to get enough BTC for the avalon tomorrow?  I'm thinking President's Day is going to mess up any chance of bank involved transactions.  My best bet seems to be bitinstant cash deposit to mtgox?
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:50:00
yeah, the fake account was a lot better at PR.  
The bitfloor 5/1 update is a one line joke and all I can think of with them is the "Stewie v. Brian Griffin - where's my money?" scene.
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:09:38
those machines to create more supply are about to come online in numbers. Asic mining groups will be able to create a large supply of BTC, hopefully the demand can keep up.
@_date: 2013-05-15 13:18:54
in your method $503.95 yields about $480.  With Dwolla I would pay $1 or $0.25 total fees.  Huge difference
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:02:14
If you wanted some good pub for what Bitcoin can do, why not setup a donation fund for the heroes and/or victims of the Boston bombing and chase?  The funds could transparently go directly to the intended recipients without middlemen, and you could make donations via phones and social media.  
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:09:35
And how many business days does it take to post an update?  Reply to a tweet? Answer an email? Approve an application for the simple ability to ACH withdrawal?  
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:03:16
and hope the exchange doesn't steal your fiat like bitfloor
@_date: 2013-05-02 20:54:57
make it right? how about you follow A. and B. from indescription? You can't approve ACH details in 2 weeks?
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:47:07
well damn
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:45:25
wtf. i moved my bitfloor btc to blockchain and both are wonked
@_date: 2013-04-26 21:12:31
dropped off of the planet.  They're not even tweetin no mo
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:09:02
Why can't they be reviewing and approving withdrawal docs right now, though?  I understand they're awaiting funds, but I submitted my ID 10 days ago and they have not approved, don't respond to email, don't reply on twitter, don't update, and disappear.
They have my money, they should be talking.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:29:56
thanks, I've been scouring reddit and bitcointalk for a post like this.  Hopefully we can use this single post as the hub of our activities and progress.
i have 4 figures stuck in bitfloor and still have not had my docs verified for ACH ability in over 10 days.  My requests go unanswered and there are no updates.  As far as I'm concerned, Roman has had enough time.
@_date: 2013-05-08 01:11:55
i feel the same way and have been investigating.  if you're not going to mine, your best bet is AM shares imho.  It pays weekly dividends, you get passive upgrades, the shares are very "liquid."
you could try btc lending, but to me it's not worth the risk.
