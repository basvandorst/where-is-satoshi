What type of things do you buy with bitcoins?

Well, if that mentality holds, no one will ever spend their bitcoins... They will keep waiting for a "impending" future.

What are some examples of software or digital goods you or your friends have purchased?
I want to see if I can spend some of my bitcoins but was looking into what I could get.

On what for example?

Wouldnt you say apps like blockchain.info are easy to use?
Also isnt crypto designed as the "Money of the internet" or money for the next generation of tech savvy youth as opposed to the past generation of 50 year olds.

But most wallets nowadays do have double authentication, with a pin needed to validate transactions onto the blockchain. Also you are not required to house your crypto at an exchange, as often it is directly deposited into your wallet. I agree with what you say, but I think individuals should not hold large quantities of crypto in their hot wallets anyway.

Is Bitcoin is inherently deflationary, wouldn't other crypto currencies with a larger supply and a more efficient infrastructure solve this issue?

The title of the whitepaper was a "p2p electronic cash system". Would this not constitute a payment network?

Basically an escrow but the customer also has the power to send the money as opposed to only ebay?

But that means that Bitcoin is functioning as a asset rather than a payments system.

But the internet in some ways was incredibly novel. In a way that nothing like it had existed previously. 
on the other hand, efficient payment networks exist, and there is really no true need for bitcoin besides to store wealth.

but facebook served a need that didn't exist in a convenient form...
online payments are way more established than social media was when facebook first launched.
