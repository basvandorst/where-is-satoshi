Precisely my thought. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:57:51
But the iPhone was "the first smartphone". All those things you mentioned are not "good enough" to stay. Bitcoin is. I still use a 3.5mm jack, windows 7, my original silverware I've had all my life, and a 12 year old bed. I could get better stuff but I don't because it's good enough, like bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:26:11
Yeah I sent $25. $1 fee. Ridiculous. And slow. No way it's gonna get adopted at that rate. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:53:33
It's been that way for a while. It's shitty. I'm missing out when exchanging fiat. 
I'm going to buy litecoin instead and convert it now. Long hours for a next gen currency is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:33:31
I like bitcoin. 
But honestly it sucks. I sent $300. It's a $4 fee. It's slow. Sure it went up in value but I can't wait to buy an altcoin with it. It's so slow and expensive. Unless it becomes fast and cheaper I won't use it anymore. I'll convert it to an alt and then reconvert it when they get it to hold value but as for using it, it's terrible. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:35:58
Exactly my issue with it. 
Good value. Shitty speed and costs too much. 
I think waves can be used to concert fiat and bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:09:32
Isn't ethereum the most secure?
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:51:57
Rage harder and ignore problems to deflect. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:43:59
 
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:04:20
I agree. It's useless for its purposes. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:15:40
They're cheaper. And until then it's still cheaper. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:54:08
Yeah I bought a lot of Ethereum yesterday. 
Made $200
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:52:14
"Peaceful" tho
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:40:52
Alphabay takes ethereum as well. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 18:01:25
Well the tech I like more since it's more fungible. The centralization? Not really. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 04:36:18
Depends on what you'll do with it too. I never hold bitcoin I use it to buy other stuff (like eth)
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:51:20
Now he's laughing to the bank.

5.2in isn't small though… nor is 2017 old. I like one handed phones. Used a 5 for 4 years until the SE came out. Plan to use it for a long time.

You sure veryone invested early?

I'm a few years you'll calculate that the tequila cost you $653.89. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:34:41
Can you give more examples? I'm trying to figure out what is a scam. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:14:46
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:35:48
So it can be a world currency. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 23:48:20
I think that if we had a way to use it for small transactions with low or no fees, it he fantastic. I don't think anyone besides miners want high fees. If large transactions had no fees or low fees, I'd be happy too. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:38:47
But they're talking about drugs.

iPhones from the 6S (A10?) were so good that they were better in performance for over a year from anything from android. I love my iPhone.

If it goes higher then it's the bear trap. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:08:58
Dash isn't tied to btc and neither is eth. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:32:54
Stocks can do that as well. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:46:02
No lambo no gamble
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:08:55
And the influx of bitcoin investors aren't dummies trying to get rich? Eth does more than bitcoin right now and has promising ICOs. Bitcoin is like faxing gold. 
I don't hold any eth. But after yesterday I wish I did. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:35:31
I agree. We are just transferring power to whales.

Online robberies aren't thaT traceable. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:47:22
Yes. I know. But I'm surprised they don't use something else like litecoin s what I'm saying.

How are icos scams? A lot iF then have value. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:27:34
Precisely. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:52:30
Because with low fees you can?
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:36:01
Yeah right. 
I have billions of bitcoin guys. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:26:57
I dont't like them. They are too well known that some sites block their ranges. :(
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:47:57
They missed today's crash lol
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:51:57
No knowledge: eth is a scam
Some knowledge: eth is a good investment 
A lot of knowledge: eth is a scam
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:19:32


You seem dismissive of eth. Why? I was as well and I was wrong. 
So you're saying high fees are good? I want to buy coffee with it, not pay $1.30 to spend $5. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 05:23:40
You can keep it in coinbase. You can also follow guidEs to use a raspberry pi tO do it. I don't have a guide since I don't use rpi 
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:21:23
Doge isn't a scam?
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:04:00
How do you know how many bytes they are? How do you calculate this?b
My wallet (Blockchain) tells me if I don't use a higher fee it won't work and I could just lose the money. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:33:15
Dash isn't? If satoshi was around, I think he'd like dash, zcash and monero for sure though. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:29:37
It will when calculated
@_date: 2017-06-24 01:26:35
Cost, right?

Crypto it's slow. But banking is even slower. I'd choose another crypto though. 
$4 isn't a bargain for me… if it was a bargain you wouldn't need to call it a bargain.

They're dominos. They start it and more and more people just drop after they do. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 01:32:06
Nah. Idiots will be idiots. They'll walk a mile to get their drink on if they had to. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:56:09
I'm not reading fud. I'm using bitcoin and I convert it to something else to transfer for speed then convert it back to btc. 
Calling bitcoin the best? How is is better? It stores value well, but the fees and the scaling is an issue, which is why eth keeps climbing. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:37:19
What long term effects would that do?
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:43:29
You can't. It won't be mass adopted at that rate. Hope lightning gets implemented or litecoin is tied to bitcoin seamlessly but we'll see.  
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:28:30
What ICO has been that bad?
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:12:29
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:21:01
Petrolyuan already does this. They also have gold conversions from yuan. Goodbye petrodollar!
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:26:24
Why else would you use a VPN?
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:46:28
My wallet warns me that if I don't use a high fee, it might not go through. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 02:48:28
Invest in alts I say. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:22:40
Not with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:37:51
Agreed. Until it's evenly distributed it's not going to wrest away power. Hopefully those in power are better.

Ugh this wrinkly ugly guy has the ugliest nose I've ever see!

What about token with only PoS?
I have waves and I don't think of it as a scam although it doesn't fulfill your requirements. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:09:31
I agree but it's more expensive than an iPhone, will drop in value faster, and I've never had good experience with Samsung anything besides their memory and SSDs. Their phones die easily and go down in value fast. Not a fan of the curve on all their phones either. 
If they made a good small cheap iPhone 5 sized phone with good internals I'd probably be more open. But the SE is definitely the best for that category. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:13:36
JW, are they transferring with bitcoin despite the high fees and slow transaction time? I'm surprised litecoin didn't gain traction yet. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:12:16
ICOs are illegal in the US now ive heard so maybe it is that way. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 02:57:29
Why that and not waves?
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:49:27
I agree. I reluctantly bought it as NY friend told me to. It's gone up a lot. But could it still be listed as "not a scam" if they reward bagholders and don't run with the money? I agree with you, it's just hard to call it a scam if it made me money. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:12:27

In tech terms it's ancient. If it was a fetus then eth isn't even born yet.

I don't trust any of them either. More than unencrypted but I wouldn't trust them either. Short of being a terrorist or a child pornographer I don't see how I could test it either.

Common sense dictates you wait a year and get it for 40%-50% off. 
Android without gapps is great, but that's difficult or rare.
