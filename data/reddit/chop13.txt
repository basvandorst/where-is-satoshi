just know that its going to most likely result in a ban of your account and the inability to create accounts under your name/info in the future if you decide to.
If you're just going to HODL anyway, then let it go through and ride it out. This drop is temporary.

You would have to pay tax on capital gains, however it entirely depends on which tax bracket you fall under. Below a certain amount of income (whether single or married), you don't pay any tax on those gains.

Thanks a lot for your explanation. But with that said, does Coinbase always report to the IRS? 
Also, given such hypothetical scenarios, if one doesn't hear anything from the IRS for 2 years after such transactions, would it be 'safe to assume' that everything is good?
found this:  so if one falls under the first 2 brackets, taxes when it comes to bitcoin are negligible? (assuming of course you don't make significant purchases/sells $100k+)

Coinbase is just a clusterfuck right now. I have made more than enough attempts at trying to get my own issues resolved with them. Not saying anything bad will happen down the road, but if I had to bet on the next best Mt.Gox candidate, it would be Coinbase. 
US citizens, I highly advise you all to switch to the (infinitely more reliable) Gemini instead.

How feasible would it be to do that though? Would you have to be a miner? Is it something you can just do from a bitcoin qt or other software wallet? I mean, I now understand the risks, thank you, but can the average joe easily pull it off? (Not saying it makes it any less of a risk)

No it’s obviously supposed to be the top half of a cat’s head.

Wow, well that sure put things together. Thanks so much for the explanation!
