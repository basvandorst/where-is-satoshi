no it wont, there won't be a single currency it'd have to be the whole crypto market. People are starting to realize that bitcoin isn't advancing anymore. it is the first blockchain/crypto for that it'll always have value. My point is that up coming ico's/cryptos will be the fate of the future in cryptocurrencies, not bitcoin.

This is why crypto is better and Banks are going under. Banks are frightened about the crypto market and since they don't know how to join it, they choose against.

I doubt it'll be the "single global currency" Because other cryptos like Ethereum are actually still working on making it better. So i can see a Crypto market like how the Stock market is today.

you guys are all talking about Gold being valuable but you have gold 2.0 right in you're face. Things that hold value don't have to be a metal is my point. Scarcity in Crypto, advanced/Growing technology, EVEN Acception in Professional sports are all factors why Cryptocurrencies are worth something in the first place. Its not back by Metal, its backed by Technology which is the future.

You're one of those scarcity scrubs that think the less coins they're the more value. In reality with crypto, its back by technology. Bitcoin isn't advancing whereas Ether and Altcoins are working to make crypto better in general. you ask very unrelated questions.

I think i see what you're saying, it shouldn't only be their citizens, it should be anyone that needs to cash out, or put cash into crypto in general. Maybe a Universal crypto debit card where you can buy/sell at any bank world wide.

Lol you're probably mad for buying btc at 15k. Way more room for profit and growth in any other crypto other than bitcoin. Just sayin.
