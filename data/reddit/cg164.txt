From an actual Bank?

This is what banks and governments do, they steal your money, this is just another way for them to do it, they are all at it, its nice to have some control back.

Thanks for your support!

Shame they had a really nice site, but it was ridiculous that some features were so hard to use, especially escrow release.

Is it bad to steal some ones idea I wonder...

Thanks for link!

Yes, holding Bitcoin is super risky and creates a multitude of problems, some quite serious.  Also you are absolutely right not using an instant BTC &gt; Fiat conversion is a lot of crappy repetitive work.

Looks like I will need a special Locabitcoin only account and only release once I have the cash from the ATM :-( PITA!

At coingas.com and cryptosextoys.com we take payments directly without a processor, we use open cart and take loads of coins (not just bitcoin), we pay all possible costs with coins and store the payment addresses in the invoices/emails so you dont even need to have your wallet open or near by when you order.
If we need £ we cash the coins on Localbitcoins to one of our regular buyers.  We did this to take alt coins but it also works to avoid the payment processors and all the lousy paperwork.

Thanks very much! Have fun!

Great show!

Unfortunately at the moment bitcoin cannot be used for suppliers so it will need to be turned into fiat if any business wants to operate for more than a month.
@_date: 2013-06-26 23:07:39
Sounds like a good idea, what features did you have in mind?
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:10:23
BTC goes legit, and about time to!

Thanks for your feedback!

My apologies, loads time are now back to normal at around 3 seconds.

You could try, bitcointalk but if you are not a member you will be in the newbie queue for ages.
Every coin has its own market place so maybe sell for an alt and then trade to BTC.  Perhaps you can put 0.01 and select seller pays shipping.

Now with over 3000 products, proper crypto sex store!

Watching the vid it seems they have plenty off sellers, just need some customers. Good luck Atlantis, but you should be fine as drugs pretty much sell themselves.

Thanks for your suggestions! Google dev tools has highlighted areas for improvement and I will work on those.
