There's a huge backlog of wire transfers. A wire transfer requires human intervention on both ends so there's a limit to how many they can do any given day. It's even worse when you consider normal banking hours and are in a different timezone than Coinbase - there might only be a few hours in the day where they're able to do wire transfers to a bank in your timezone.
If you use ACH, you'll get your money within 2-3 business days because it's automated.

I'd argue that a desktop wallet is less secure than an exchange. A company like Coinbase has a dedicated security staff, insurance against hacks, etc. I've seen PCs so infected with malware that they could barely function so there's no way I'd suggest anyone ever use a desktop wallet to store a significant amount of bitcoin.
Keep your coins on an exchange or use a hardware wallet, don't use a desktop wallet unless you already have very solid security practices or just don't use the PC for much.

Besides that, if you have your exchange linked to your bank account and start depositing huge amounts of money, the IRS will notice. The only way to avoid the IRS finding out about massive gains is to only deal with cash and only anonymously, like through localbitcoins. If there are any bitcoin wallets linked to your identity in any way, the government can (and will!) find out about it.
And good luck trying to say "I lost the bitcoins in a boating accident and don't have them anymore". They'll ask you to prove it. They'll ask you how you were able to afford that nice boat on your shit salary and ask for receipts and go over your bank records. If you can't prove how you paid for all of your fancy shit, they will take it. It sucks but that's how it works and how it has worked for a very long time.

How does generating energy destroy the planet?
The areas where bitcoin mining is profitable are areas with a huge amount of excess energy. They're using power from power plants that were already built but weren't generating full output because of lack of demand. That's why it's cheap.
Instead of just looking at charts, spend some time trying to understand the energy economy and how energy is produced.
Edit: To give you a hint, much of the power is generated from hydroelectric plants in China. Even the newer plants were planned long before bitcoin ever existed. The Chinese government built these to sustain growth, but the human population hasn't met the demand so the power is cheap and available and isn't destroying the Earth any more than has already been destroyed by building the dam that runs the plant.

My wife also suggested I should sell immediately when she realized how much they were worth about 6 months ago. It's up a lot since then obviously. I just tell her "if I listened to everyone who told me to sell, we wouldn't have this much". I've been holding since 2014 so I'm up quite a bit.
It also helps that it wasn't a very big initial investment and it's still not a majority of our net worth. I'm already set to retire in 2-4 years even without the BTC, so even if it goes to zero we won't exactly be hurting.
At this point I'm going to limit BTC to 30% of our net worth as it grows. If it goes above 30%, I'll sell some. That'll let me siphon off some gains into our main nest egg. When I decide to retire, I'll sell half of my BTC and use it as fun money, assuming it's still worth something.
So I suggest putting together a plan of what you'll do if your BTC goes up and what you'll do if it goes down. Make a plan to funnel some amount of profit somewhere else to reduce risk. If BTC dropping to zero would have a significant impact on your life, cash out enough that it would no longer have this impact.

This article is based on a 2 week old blog post and it's wrong. Coinbase didn't say that SegWit support is their 3rd priority, they said that adding new features is their 3rd priority. SegWit is one of those features. The only thing they promised is that they would deliver SegWit support in 2018.

If it helps you sleep at night, go for it.
The way I usually think of it is this:
Let's say you invested $1000 and now it's worth $2000. If instead you had $2000 right now, would you invest it in BTC? Or would you only invest $1000?
Figure out how much money you want to have in BTC right now. Ignore the past gains or losses. Thinking about how much you are up or down is a beginner mistake and a logical fallacy (unless you're planning for taxes, etc).
Edit: It also helps to look at it through the lens of portfolio balancing. How much of your net worth is in BTC? Do you think that's too high? Then sell and diversify. Do you think it's too low? Buy more.

When I first started buying bitcoin, it was moon-or-bust for me. It was fun money, money I could easily afford to lose. I held for two years at a loss, from 2014-2015. But in 2016 the price was hovering at $600 and I was up 3x. Then it went up to $900 and $1000 in 2017. Up 5x.
At that point my wife and I decided that if we got to the point where we could sell 90% of our bitcoin to pay off the mortgage (after cap gains, etc), then we would do it. I'm close enough to retirement that if the BTC holdings dropped to zero, it would have no impact on my retirement plans. I already have a decent nest egg, the BTC is just icing on the cake.
Anyway, it seemed ridiculous then, BTC would have to be worth about $25k to sell enough to pay off the mortgage and the capital gains tax while leaving 10% to hold.
Now I'm kinda terrified by how close we are. Here are some of my fears:
- We'll hit $25k but I won't be able to sell because Coinbase is down, then it crashes to zero
- We'll hit $24,999 and then crash to zero without ever selling
- We'll hit $25k and I'll sell but BTC will go up to $100k within a month
Most people here seem to be concerned about being able to hold during dips. I got dips. I held my stocks through the dotcom bubble and the housing crisis. The first two years I held BTC it was at a loss. I can handle watching my net worth drop 50% without breaking a sweat. But I can't handle watching my net worth go to the fucking moon without freaking out about it and wanting to convert it to gold coins and jewels and hoard it in a cave like a dragon, breathing fire on anyone who tries to steal it.
But anyway, we have a plan and we're sticking to it. See you fuckers at ~~$25k~~ $24.999k.

The problem is that the community can't decide on solutions. The scaling debate has been going on for years. Most of the original Bitcoin core developers gave up on the project because they couldn't make progress.
Progress on the protocol is stalled and has been for a while. It's just not possible to change the Bitcoin protocol anymore because there will always be fundamentalists that argue it shouldn't be changed and that only soft forks will be allowed.
SegWit is a neat idea, but it's also an absurd hack. It's an accounting trick that doesn't actually offer real scalability, it simply allows more transactions in a block because only some of the bytes are counted. It doesn't save network bandwidth or blockchain storage space. Years ago, such a proposal would be seen as ridiculous and overly complicated. But now it's the only solution because just simply increasing the block size is sacrilege.
It was easy to get consensus in the early days because everyone working on the project believed in it. They did it in their spare time and it wasn't worth anything. Everyone had the same goal. But now there are tons of people involved, there's a shitload of money involved, and everyone not only has different goals but different ideas on how to reach those goals. Consensus for a protocol change will never happen again and Bitcoin will continue to be forked and forked until nobody really knows which fork has the best claim for being "the real Bitcoin". Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies will eat its lunch.

There's no consensus in bitcoin and I doubt there ever will be ever again. The only time consensus is really necessary is when proposing a feature that would hard fork the chain. That consensus will never exist and any scaling solutions will need to be done off-chain or implemented as "accounting tricks" like SegWit.
Basically, any serious hard fork proposal will split into at least two factions.

Online shopping is just a modern version of catalog shopping. Before the internet, people would browse catalogs and make a phone call to order stuff. Before credit cards you would send them a check or wire money. I still remember filling out order forms from catalogs and asking my mom to write a check to send them and I'd give her cash to pay her back.
Obviously the process of receiving something too much longer - a month or more - but it's basically the same thing.

The critical thing you're missing here is that the internet was able to scale by continually upgrading and replacing the first layer to improve bandwidth and latency. TCP/IP have effectively been the same protocol for 40+ years, but the physical and data link layers have changed drastically. And that's the great thing about the internet - you can replace the underlying technology and the applications still work without modification.
So by your model, once applications are developed on top of Bitcoin, Bitcoin itself will need to be replaced with something that can scale. This is the opposite of what you're trying to suggest...

The fact that miners are necessary is BTC's biggest risk for future dominance. PoW uses a ton of energy and lots of people seem to think it's wasted. I personally don't, but it's been shown that PoW simply isn't as necessary for decentralization as people first thought. The fact that it's not necessary to invest in hardware with a limited lifespan, a warehouse to house it, and energy to run it, is a huge risk. It also means there's a huge up-front cost to becoming a miner which is a risk to decentralization. Of course full nodes are the ones that verify transactions, but they won't be included in a block unless a miner chooses to put it into a block, so centralization of miners is dangerous.
And people that are working on ASIC-resistant PoW solutions are missing the forest for the trees and trying to solve the wrong problem.
I do think BTC dominance will continue for a while, as long as it's profitable to build warehouses full of mining rigs. But if there's a "flippening" event and some other currency (based on PoS) passes BTC's market cap, I don't think it'll be able to recover. The price will go down, miners will abandon their operations, and the BTC network will continue on as a hobby project but will have no significant economic footprint.
People will look back on PoW coins and think "what were we even thinking? what a waste!"

You are boned. You can recover your account with the seed or the number, but if you lost both there's nothing they can or should do.
The security that's preventing you from accessing your account is doing exactly what it was intended to do. Would you really want someone who didn't have your phone number or seed to access your account? Because that's what you're asking for.
All you can really do is try to get your old phone number back or get it re-activated. Or maybe call the person who owns it now and explain the situation and have them message you the SMS recovery code.
Coinbase support won't and shouldn't help you.
Edit: To think of it a different way, you lost your wallet password. There's no way to recover it. But in this case, Coinbase has your wallet password but there's no way for you to prove your identity to them because you lost your phone number and recovery seed.
It's amazing that people fight against the KYC/AML stuff but then expect an exchange to just hand their coins over without proving who they are. "You can't have my identity, but if I show you my ID you should give me my tokens!"

The law only applies to cash deposits, not checks, ACH, or wire transfers. Why? Because the bank has records of where checks and wires come from. If the IRS decides to investigate they can get all of that data from the bank easily. They can determine pretty easily if a transfer was money that should have been taxed but you decided not to pay tax on it.
But they have no record of where cash comes from. So if you deposit more than $10k, the IRS gets notified. That doesn't mean it's suspicious, they just want to make sure you pay taxes on it.
Structuring is where you purposely deposit less than $10k at a time, over a period of time, to avoid the IRS reporting requirements. The funny thing about that is that the banks can detect that you're doing that and tell the IRS. You aren't getting away with anything by structuring your deposits, you're just breaking the law.

LTC and ETH will survive the coming altcoin/ICO bubble pop. My reasoning is that they're not run by a company, they're run by a community of volunteers that believe in what they're doing.
Most altcoins/ICOs are just people trying to get rich. LTC and ETH have been around long enough that the early people involved are already wealthy and they can continue working on their vision with the help of the community.
When the bubble pops most of the people behind the real shitcoins will abandon their project because they never really cared about them - they just wanted to strike it rich on an ICO. If they don't get rich, they'll move on.

@_date: 2017-11-05 14:52:43


The tax advantages of a traditional (non-ROTH) 401k are irrelevant compared to bitcoin. The advantage is that the growth (dividends, capital gains) isn't taxed until you begin withdrawing money from the account. But bitcoin isn't taxed until you sell it. If you wait to retirement to sell it, it'll have the same benefits of a 401k. But on the other hand, if you feel like timing the market, you can move the 401k in and out of cash-equivalent investments without having to pay the capital gains. I don't do that. I've been hodling investments since before bitcoin existed and it's worked out pretty well for me through a couple of major market crashes.

Are you forgetting that the reason exists in the first place was because of censorship on The mods refused to allow discussion of "software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus". Just mentioning Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin XT was enough to get your thread deleted or even banned. The problem with that is that can't reach a consensus without discussing something, but the mods were just banning discussion of clients and protocol changes they disagreed with because they weren't "overwhelming consensus".
So that's why is full of people who overwhelmingly support/worship the Bitcoin Core devs and name-call/insult everyone else. If you visit other more neutral forums like you'll find a more diverse point of view than what you'll get here.
Edit: If anyone's wondering, I'm firmly on Core's side regarding block size, I just think this sub has way too many people who resort to personal attacks and name-calling because they're not smart enough to attack the actual ideas. I think the mods are fostering that type of community because they don't allow debating non-consensus ideas but they do allow personal attacks.

The other thing people are freaking out about is the idea that the IRS will try to charge taxes for moving Bitcoins from one wallet to another, like from Coinbase to your own wallet.
That's not a taxable event. You won't owe taxes for that. If the IRS suggests that you might owe taxes for transferring Bitcoins out of Coinbase, you tell them that it went to your wallet and you can prove it's your wallet because you have the private key.
But I seriously doubt the IRS would even ask you about it unless they have other evidence that you turned those BTC into cash, like a massive deposit to your bank account. They're looking for people who converted BTC to cash and vice versa in amounts that don't line up with what they reported to the IRS for those years.
Edit: If you really want to evade taxes with cryptocurrencies, you need to avoid banks and exchanges (in the US) because the IRS can compel them to give up their records. If you have significant income you need to launder it. You can't expect to use a bank or an exchange that complies with KYC/AML laws and think you can avoid paying what you owe.

While not an outright scam, he sells bitcoin cloud mining contracts. I don't say it's a scam because they're delivering what they're selling, but they are extremely misleading.
They advertise that if you buy a certain amount of hashrate for a 12 month period, you'll get a certain dollar amount per day. If you do basic math, it looks like you'll break even in about 8 months and have 4 months of profit before the contract is over. Sounds great!
The very fine print tells you that as difficulty increases on the bitcoin network, your hashrate will earn you less. They also take a fixed daily fee out of your earnings. So if you start with $100 a day, they might charge $20 and leave you with $80. But if your gross daily earnings drops below $20 for a period of time, they cancel your contract.
Basically, your best case scenario is that you'll break even in a year. Most people don't. If you just bought bitcoin instead of a mining contract, you'd earn more money. The only time a mining contract is worth it is if difficulty decreases steadily over time so your hashrate mines more blocks... but that also means bitcoin's price has been going down and miners are turning down mining hardware, so the blocks are worth less.
People who sell cloud mining contracts do it to take advantage of people, not because they want bitcoin to succeed. They're not outright scammers, but they prey on people who can't do math. Not great for the community.

$1M is enough to reach financial security, but most people will still have to work, especially if you're young. You won't have to work as long, though. $1M in the stock market will double in roughly 7 years. At $2M you're at the point where you don't need to work anymore, depending on your lifestyle. That's enough to pull out $80k/yr for life (a 4% withdrawal rate).

If you learn enough about bitcoin, you'll realize it can't possibly be a scam or ponzi. There's no single person or group in charge that collects money for it and it doesn't pay interest or dividends. So anyone claiming it's a scam or ponzi is just flat out wrong.
Now there are companies involved in bitcoin that are complete scams. There have been quite a few ponzis involving bitcoin. But bitcoin itself can't be a scam and there are many reputable places to get it.
So anyone capable of doing a tiny bit of research and using critical thinking will realize it's not a scam. If people insist on it being a scam or ponzi, they're just an idiot who isn't worth convincing.
The big question is: is bitcoin worth anything? That's really the only thing worth debating. Some very smart people think it's not, some very smart people think it is.

I never tell anyone how much my BTC is worth or how many I have, but I do tell them when I started acquiring my coins if it comes up.
Literally EVERY SINGLE PERSON says "wow, it's way up, you should cash out now!". Or, back in the day "wow, it's way down, you should cash out now!". No matter what the price is, the suggestion is to cash out.
If I listened to people who told me to sell I'd have nothing left now but I still have my full stack. It helps that I don't need the money. I have a decent job and have been working my career for 20 years and I can retire soon even without the BTC.

If he's the kind of person who pisses away money with gold diggers, I doubt he would have held onto that 1000BTC until now.

People have been telling me that for a couple of years and if I listened to them I'd have no BTC left.
Most people would see a 100% gain and immediately cash out and think they're an investing genius. I don't need the money I have in BTC so I'll just let it ride. At this point I'm up 17x. BTC would have to drop by 95% for me to be in the red.

You need to give bitcoin credit for fighting the status quo. OP is right that there are tons of things that use more energy and I agree that bitcoin's use of energy is for a better cause.
But I agree with you that it's a shitty argument. Just because you're better than the worst shit in the world doesn't mean you're the best.
Sure, bitcoin might be faster than writing a check and cheaper than Western Union. Maybe it uses less energy than the Bank of America tower that I can see from my back yard. But there are objectively better solutions out there for censorship-proof trustless digital cash transfers than having a datacenter full of ASICs in China. There are faster and cheaper tokens that use far less energy.
I still love bitcoin and most of my cryptocurrency holdings are bitcoin, but I'm also a realist and won't just cheer for bitcoin because it's my favorite team. I can acknowledge that PoW isn't the best solution for the problem that bitcoin is trying to solve.
Here's a stupid car analogy: Bitcoin developers are like engine manufacturers trying to make a more efficient internal combustion engine. Yes it's a worthy cause and it's better than a steam turbine powered by coal. But there are other people out there leapfrogging the technology to build purely electric cars.

Bitcoin has several flaws that can allow one person to manipulate it. Many are spelled out in the original whitepaper, like the 51% attack.
But are you talking about manipulating the network or manipulating the price? Because while there was an attack on the network making it hard to make transactions, the network itself was safe and recovered. No bitcoin transactions were lost.
But one person being able to manipulate the price is possible in all financial markets. There's nothing the bitcoin protocol, or any cryptocurrency protocol, can do to prevent that from happening. The exchange rate to USD or other currencies isn't a fundamental property of the protocol, it's completely external and unrelated.

Around 2010 I thought we were complete fucking retards for spending that money on drugs when the price of gold was approaching $2k/oz. If I bought gold bullion instead of dope I'd have an 8x gain on my investment. I could have turned my $250 ounce of weed into $2k.

To give you some perspective, this isn't unique to cryptocurrencies.
There are tons of stories of people who held stock in a company, sold when there was a panic, then found out they would have been millionaires if they just held for a few years.
Apple (AAPL) is one - they were about to go bankrupt in the mid 90s. The low in 1997 is a split-adjusted 47 cents. Now they're trading at $170 20 years later.
There's a website that tracks how much your AAPL stock would be worth now if you bought the stock instead of an Apple product:
If you bought a share of AAPL instead of blowing $170 on an iPod in 2001, you'd have $53k worth of shares now.
My point is that right now you're worried about past mistakes when RIGHT THIS VERY SECOND there is some investment you could make that will give you 100x gains. The hard part is figuring out what it is. It's easy to say "if I knew back then what I know now...", but there are investments available today that are next decade's huge winners. Good luck picking the right one!

I invested a pretty small amount, less than 1% of my net worth at the time. It was a low enough amount that if I lost it, it wouldn't be a big deal. It's now over 20% of my net worth. But I still don't need that money. I'm 20 years into my career as a software engineer and set to retire within the next few years anyway. I don't even include the BTC/ETH/LTC I'm holding as part of my "real net worth" or FIRE number (for those of you who hang out in It's still bonus money to me and it wouldn't impact my future plans if they all dropped to zero tomorrow.
So to answer your question, when will I sell? Probably the day I quit my job and retire for real. I'll cash it in and buy an RV or some property in the mountains if it's worth enough. If it's worth an absurd amount of money, multiple millions, I'll probably find ways to give it away or start a charity or scholarship or something. But by that point, seeing it grow another 2x or 10x would be pointless. We wouldn't spend it. We already spend enough to make us happy and spending more wouldn't make us any happier.
So TL;DR: when I invested it was play money to me, it's still play money, and I'll cash out whenever I want

If he deposits any money in a bank account he'll have federal marshals showing up at his door asking where he got it. He'll be limited to dealing strictly in cash with something like LocalBitcoins.

It's not an outright scam, they are delivering exactly what they say they will when you pay for it.
But it's a completely idiotic investment designed to attract people who can't do the math to figure out why it's bad. So I'll help you out:
Get a chart of the price history of bitcoin, and every time you paid into the mining contract, figure out how much bitcoin you could get that day for that amount of money.
Now figure out how much that BTC would be worth today compared to what you got from the mining contract. I'll give you a hint: if you just bought BTC you'd be doing much much better.
Why? Because mining contracts sell a certain hash rate for a certain amount of money. But bitcoin mining gets more difficult over time, so each month you will get less and less bitcoin from your contract for a certain hash rate.
Since the price of bitcoin has been going up rapidly, it might seem like you're getting a good deal because you're making a profit. Everyone loves profit. But that profit isn't anywhere near what you'd get if you just bought bitcoin instead of a mining contract.
**TL;DR:** Mining contracts aren't always a scam, they're just a shitty investment that earn less than buying bitcoin outright.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:08:51

This is a dumb idea. Cloud mining is already a ripoff, and your friend wants to skim even more off the top?
Just buy $350 worth of BTC and hold on to it. You'll make much more doing that than you would with a cloud mining contract.
Edit: 1 month ago, $350 would get you 0.06345 BTC. Today that would be worth $495. So why the hell do you think it would be a good idea to spend $350 that you'll never get back to earn $50 in a month? You could have had almost $150 in profit if you just bought 1 month ago and held on!

I'm not sure about the laws in which country or state you're in, but where I am if you were married at the time you acquired the BTC back in 2012 then she already legally owns half of it. Hiding it from her makes you the bad guy in the situation and is grounds for divorce.
Just tell her about it. If she freaks out and says you need to sell them all right now, explain that if you sold before you never would have had that much in the first place. If she's adamant, offer to split the bitcoin into 3rds - you keep 1/3 to do whatever you want with, she gets 1/3 to do whatever she wants with, and you keep 1/3 for family things like buying a new house.

But there was an effective increase in block size recently. SegWit allows more transactions in blocks through an accounting trick. More transactions still use more bandwidth, but part of the transaction is moved outside of the set of bytes that are counted as "the block".
So why is a complex change to block layout better than a simple block size increase? The answer is probably that SegWit allowed an effective increase in block size without changing consensus rules (a hard fork).
But it's still ridiculous to argue against block size increases because they use more bandwidth when SegWit also did this.

That's the biggest problem with PoW today, besides the massive energy consumption. Hashpower is centralized in places where it's most profitable, meaning where electricity is cheapest. It also drives secretive development of mining hardware, leading to things like ASICBOOST to get an edge.
Proof-of-stake levels the playing field a bit because you only need to purchase a large stake. You don't need specialized hardware, you don't need data centers, you don't need extreme amounts of energy.
There's also the benefit that if you get caught cheating, you lose your stake. Compare that to mining hardware, where if you cheat nothing happens and you keep your hardware and can mine other coins if people blacklist you.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:22:09
What's evidenceless? It's a fact that covert ASICBoost still works on Bitcoin Cash and that the miners that created and use ASICBoost (Bitmain) are the same miners that pushed for Bitcoin Cash and were against SegWit. Neither of those facts can be disputed.

That's a pretty major misunderstanding of SegWit. The actual number of bytes used by transactions is allowed to take up more space but the signatures are only counted as taking up 1/4 of the space. It's an accounting trick. The actual bytes are still there, the blockchain is allowed to use more network bandwidth and grow more rapidly. The only real benefit of doing that over a simple block size limit was that no hard fork was required. Although an unintended bonus was that it makes it impossible to use ASICBoost in an undetected way.

Not really. Visa is a very well-run company and can adapt to changes in FinTech.
This kind of talk reminds me of people who say oil companies will go out of business after peak oil. No, not really. Most oil companies have already re-branded themselves as "energy companies" and are investing heavily in wind and solar power. You really think a bunch of rich dudes are going to willingly watch their money disappear instead of adapting? I guess it's possible. It's happened before with smaller companies like Blockbuster.

This is true, and that's why "investing" in bitcoin is actually speculating, not investing. You are just betting that you'll be able to sell it at profit in the future. But meanwhile, the underlying asset doesn't change.
Compare that to stocks, where the asset is part ownership in a business run by people. There are profits and your shares entitle you to the profits. Many companies re-invest these profits into the business, some pay them out in dividends. But there's a huge difference between investing in a company and speculating on an asset like gold or a currency like bitcoin.

I searched for 'bitcoin' in a new incognito tab and the first few things I saw were news articles about bitcoin. The first real link was to bitcoin.org, the second was to bitcoin's wikipedia page. The 3rd one was to bitcoin.com. I clicked it to humor you.
The first thing I see is a big button that says "Start Mining Bitcoin!", so I clicked that. It let me to a page to sign up for a cloud mining contract, which itself seems pretty scammy, but it's clear that there was a difference between "Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin Cash".
When I tried other links, like "Buy Bitcoin", it was clear that I was being sold Bitcoin and not Bitcoin Cash.
I clicked around a lot and didn't see anywhere someone could get tricked into buying BCH instead of BTC.

Something that many people don't realize is that when you propose a change to Bitcoin's protocol, you can't just get the code checked into the Bitcoin Core repository and call it a day. That's just a single implementation of the client. To build consensus you need to convince lots of people it's a good idea and get every Bitcoin client to implement the changes. That's why it's taking so long for SegWit to roll out. There are only a couple of implementations out there and Core's isn't even complete yet.
And that's the big problem with proposing any change that results in a hard fork. Without a very wide consensus among miners, wallets, exchanges, and users, you'll end up with a split chain. At this point I can't imagine that any Bitcoin hard fork proposal would get wide enough acceptance to avoid a split. There will always be a set of holdouts for the "original" chain. I'm just glad I got in early enough to hold tokens on all of the recent splits, even if they're currently worthless. You never know when one of them might actually take off and take over.

The problem with Uber is that people think it can replace a regular day job. It's fine for what it was intended to be - a way for people to make extra money on the side by driving people around. The idiots who want to do it for a living without doing the math to realize it's a bad idea are ruining it for everyone else.

It'll be interesting to see how they came up with those numbers. My guess is that they know the addresses of Coinbases's wallets and can track transfers to and from them. If someone has a lot of transactions out of Coinbase wallets then it's likely that they could owe some taxes or at least should be reporting to the IRS.

Not even the latest Bitcoin Core wallet GUI supports it yet.
It's absurdly complicated to add wallet support for SegWit. Just check out the requirements:

What makes you think that? I'd personally love it if Coinbase sent me a 1099 for my BTC/USD transactions each year.
Edit: I still don't agree with the IRS's request and side with Coinbase in that it's a fishing expedition. But if CB decided that they were going to start sending 1099s, I'd be happy.

I'm a long term holder and have been following the fork debate since it started. Hell, even before that, when people were still talking about Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and Bitcoin Unlimited.
But I'm not dumb enough to presume that I'll know which chain the market will value more and then sell immediately based on my guess.
I still haven't sold my BCH either. In fact it's still in my main wallet, I haven't split it out yet.

The article was published in June while it was still accurate. I have no idea why OP decided to post it here. Most of it is wrong now. BTC's market cap is 3x what it was when the article is written, surpassing the net worth of all individuals.

A lawyer can't, but a lawyer can convince a judge to. If your spouse (or soon-to-be ex-spouse) finds out how much you have, they can take it. You can try using the excuse "lost my Trezor in a boating accident" but judges have heard that shit long before bitcoin existed. It used to be "all of my cash was in a box and I lost it in a boating accident".
The judge will laugh at you and tell you to pay anyway because you can't prove you actually spent or lost the money. They'll garnish your wages. You might say "then I won't have a job and I'll just live off of my secret bitcoins". Right, until a private investigator sees that you've been spending money you haven't earned and notify the courts and the IRS, who will come and take your stuff away. And thanks to the open ledger nature of bitcoin, they can just watch your wallet address like a hawk and wait for any movement to come after you to prove you lied. So yeah, you'll end up paying anyway. Unless you just flee the country and never come back.
But is it really worth it? Why the fuck would you be in a relationship with someone where you actually consider leaving the country with your money as a viable relationship exit strategy?
Also remember that hiding assets can be grounds for divorce. People are worried about what will happen if their spouse is an asshole and tries to take their money, but by hiding assets you're making the first asshole move.
But also I suspect people who suggest hiding bitcoin assets from your spouse aren't actually married. And probably teenagers who haven't been in a serious relationship with anyone at all.

That dude is crazy enough that he probably cut his own dick off years ago and keeps it in a jar, cutting off slices every once in a while to use in place of pepperoni on homemade pizza. He's been eating his dick for years so it won't be a big deal to eat the rest of it.

SegWit doesn't do anything to make transactions more efficient. It's an accounting trick. The same amount of data is still going across the network and stored in the blockchain, there is just less of it counted as "block size". So yes it allows you to fit more transactions in a block without a hard fork to increase the block size, but the data is still there.

Tons of people made charts just like this, but nobody is sharing the ones that didn't work out.
I could make a ton of charts right now that predict bitcoin will be anywhere from 1000 to 100,000 by the end of 2018, then I'll just show off the one that was closest to right and people will think I'm an amazing trader.

I work with a guy who was planning to dump about $100k into cloud mining and retire. He saw he could get $500 a day and the contract would pay for itself after 7 or 8 months, after that it was all profit. Since he only needed a fraction of that to live on, he could keep putting the extra into contracts and increase his earnings exponentially. He showed me his spreadsheets working out the numbers and he was about to quit his job. He was an older dude, in his mid-50s, and this was his life savings.
I looked at his spreadsheet and asked where he was accounting for the difficulty adjustments. He didn't know what that was. I facepalmed hard. It took a while but I explained that it would probably take over a year to break even on his investment, if at all. I told him the daily pay rate would steadily decrease until it's zero. He had NO IDEA about any of this. It was kinda sad. I suggested just buying and holding onto some bitcoin was a better idea than cloud mining, but he told me I convinced him that the whole thing was a scam. That everything about bitcoin was a scam. Ooops.
Sucks for him because that was January this year. If he dumped that $100k into BTC in January he'd have a cool million bucks now and be able to easily retire.
Edit: I also asked him about taxes and he said "Bitcoin's unregulated, you don't have to pay any taxes on it". Pretty clueless dude.

If you think it's a good idea to short as the price is punching through an all-time high, you should probably do some more research on trading strategies and bitcoin's price movement history.

Liquidity isn't a property of cryptocurrencies, it's a measure of how cheaply and quickly the cryptocurrency can be traded for other currencies on centralized exchanges. The only thing that influences that is how popular it is, not how great the technology is.
It's a little weird that you say your biggest concerns are decentralization and liquidity when liquidity only exists because of centralized exchanges.

Something else to think about is that all of these new people buying in because they heard Bitcoin is a great investment will be the first to sell when there's a correction, driving the price down even further.

Desktop wallets are a horrible idea. Tons of people lose money from their desktop wallets due to malware and phishing attacks. AV and ad-blocking software won't help.
Don't keep your bitcoin wallet on the same machine you use for daily web surfing, email, chat, gaming, etc. It's just asking for trouble. You could be the next person posting that your [Electrum wallet was emptied]( when you stepped away.

There's no reason to hold GBTC if you have the option of holding BTC instead. GBTC's premium will eventually be wiped out. If anything it'll eventually be trading for slightly less than BTC/USD because of the fees involved.

At $6350 it costs $133,350 to get into the 21 club. That's out of reach for the vast majority of people in the world and even most people in developed and wealthy countries. People who do have $133k to dump into bitcoin likely have it locked up in retirement accounts where it's difficult to buy BTC directly.
So for those of you who had the foresight or luck to get in early and accumulate 21 or more BTC, enjoy the ride.
