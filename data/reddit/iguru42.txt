This is something I've been thinking about with the recent over/under 9000 thing.  Is this the most times we've crossed an arbitrary value?

There's an old post on another forum where a person typoed HOLD, to hodl when a large dip occured.  Since then hodl has been the term for bitcoiner's holding onto their bitcoin regardless of the market.

The longer parent to this reply is very good, but I think I got more from your reply.  TYVM!  I had heard of a short squeeze before but never understood it, now i get it.

This is my main thought. I don't believe them but even if I did my earlier point stands. In the next few months a whole lot of new hashing power is going to come online and AFAICT anything that hashes at less than xxxgh/s will be largely irrelevant. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:47:16
"The" Bitcoin?  "The?"  Again and again "the?"  WTF?  Maybe it's just me but I've never heard bitcoin used with a persistent preceding "the" before.

I agree, 30% is a very aggressive assumption, difficulty has never increased at such a consistent rate, I wanted to go with a worst case scenario.
And while I agree that miners that become unprofitable do drop off the network, the reason they've become unprofitable is because their hashing power relative to the network has become miniscule, so I don't see them dropping off as having a perceptible impact on difficulty.
This year has been the year of the ASIC, the difficulty graph is in full hockey stick mode, and with the introduction of 28nm chips I'd say that's going to continue until at least February.  Will ASICs make the transition to a 13nm process?  Maybe a new startup will arrive with a completely new kind of chip for hashing?  No one knows, but I think you are agreeing with me that difficulty is going to increase significantly through February at which point a 2TH rig might be able to grind out 20 bucks a day, that just seems pretty dire.
That is unless of course the hockey stick graph does plateau, then the people with TerraMiners will be pretty happy, I just don't think that's likely.
So far, AFAICT, bitcoin mining has followed the classic gold rush scenario; The best person to be is the guy selling shovels (rigs), (almost) everyone else loses money.

Yes, seriously, I try my best to listen to what people are saying, especially on difficult to understand issues, because that is when you stand the best opportunity to learn something.
Now I'm annoyed that the OP has USD in it at all it's really just there as a convenience as its easier for me to comprehend the value of 30 USD an hour (day, week, or whatever period), than .217 BTC.
Ultimately I think my point stands, that difficulty is going to rise dramatically in the near future, and quite possibly for much of next year, significantly affecting the profitability of BTC mining.
@_date: 2013-09-15 14:35:50
BTC doesn't stand alone in a vacuum it's usefulness is always going to be relative to fiat currencies.  That said, yeah I understand that assuming the price is the weakest part of my assumptions, but something has to be assumed, otherwise we're just talking BTC, and how could you calculate ROI without including fiat somewhere in there?
Even if you bought your rig with BTC, the price you paid in BTC is certainly calculated against the current exchange in fiat, right?  No seller of a rig has it for sale at 100 BTC, and then ignores the exchange rate, right?  If BTC crashed tomorrow to 1 USD, I'm sure the TerraMiners would suddenly be priced at 14000 BTC.

I did email BFL, but I didn't really wait for a reply because I don't expect them to be really snappy about replying, since I was close to 6 months from the order date I figured I might as well just start the chargeback with AMEX.  The AMEX lady did say something interesting though, she said if I had started a chargeback with paypal then she would have had to cancel the AMEX one, since between AMEX, paypal, and BFL I trust AMEX the most I think I started with the right party.
@_date: 2013-09-15 17:04:45






Ooooooooooook.  I see what you are talking about now.  Got it.
@_date: 2013-09-15 12:16:51
I agree, a 30% increase every 10 days for the next year is pretty unlikely, BUT lets assume that CoinTerra does ship what they say they will in December, 1000 2TH machines, the entire network will go from 1PH to 3PH by next year, December alone should have a massive increase in difficulty. 
@_date: 2013-09-15 14:43:38
I removed the numbers after Feb as I'm more interested in discussing the near future than over a year from now.
@_date: 2013-09-14 17:45:02
I posted about my chargeback a couple weeks ago.
I emailed them, asked for a refund and they sent me the generic "all sales are final" email.
I contacted AMEX and filed a chargeback, AMEX filed with Paypal, Paypal still has it under review.
BFL has changed my order status to complete - refunded.
I have not received any money back yet though.
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:46:34
Looking at the numbers and what the actual difficulty has done, clearly my 30% adjustment per period wasn't aggressive enough.  Something is going to have to change in the mining world soon, it cannot continue like this indefinitely.  Whether that is in 4 months or 4 years I don't know, but unless some knew hashing algorithm or technology arrives eventually the hashing rate will plateau.
@_date: 2013-11-09 13:05:31
And as with the price of gold the price of BTC will certainly affect the numbers of miners in the marketplace.  The overall point above about the dangers of using the future price of BTC to calculate profit is absolutely true, but at that time it was 150, we've more than doubled since then, if BTC were to double again in the next 2 months we'd be at 700+,  that would have a huge impact on the profitability of a Terraminer IV bought in January, but as with BTC all things are variable especially during rallies, so I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
@_date: 2013-09-15 12:12:45
Yeah TP's is what I started with, but it doesn't calculate forward in time.  It's a great calculator for a specific difficulty but given that difficulty changes about every 10 days I thought it made more sense to project forward through time a bit, hence the spreadsheet.
@_date: 2013-06-25 03:55:34
Yeah crazy bids sitting out there:
@_date: 2013-09-15 16:46:21
Are you making the case that BTC mining should never be equated into fiat at any point?
To some degree I see that when mining BTC, you get BTC, and the exchange is irrelevant to that but (and this is a rather big but in my opinion) it seems to me that would only be correct if one were to never do anything with their mined BTC.  Going back to my point, which you agreed is a good one, whenever someone does do something with their BTC, even if it's in direct trade for a widget or service, the current exchange rate has a direct impact at that time.
Now if we're talking about profitability I agree that there does seem something wrong with calculating it against an arbitrary point in time  and exchange rate.  If we're playing that game, then someone who mined 1000 BTC with a GPU in 2010 and sold them now would have a massively profitable miner, and I think you're saying I'm doing the opposite, extrapolating into the future and using an arbitrary exchange rate and declaring a negative proposition.
If that's what you are saying, I absolutely concede the point that converting BTC against arbitrary points in time is not a great way to figure out the profit/loss of a miner, maybe you would be more comfortable if I called it potential profit?
@_date: 2013-06-21 04:15:57
Usually there is a certain amount of parity between the different exchanges, I've never seen Bitstamp and Mt.Gox diverge so distinctly.
As a guess, I would assume that people are buying BTC on Gox, then sending the BTC to Bitstamp and converting to USD there, anyone else have an opinion?

I don't believe them.  Regardless, as I have said a couple of times now, with the hashing power coming online in the next few months the probability that a single will ever have a positive ROI is very small.
