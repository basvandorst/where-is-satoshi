Reddit economists.  Gotta love 'em.
@_date: 2019-11-05 17:06:19
I kinda agree.  Crypto-currencies in general are a solution looking for a problem.

Only $10,000?

As a future CPA I’d be interested to see some of their accounting ledger entries.

Nice to see the anti spam efforts are paying off.

What you've just said is one of the most insanely, idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response, were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.

Stability.  The US Treasury/Gov won't cease to exist.
@_date: 2019-11-10 23:07:16
Unlikely it’s a big bank.  Big banks have too many people and somebody would have spilled the beans by now.  Also, banks like the status quo and won’t rock the boat.

Won't happen.  The powers that be are too entrenched.  The system has to collapse so it can be rebuilt.
Here in the US, we don't do anything until somebody gets killed.  Every town has a "Dead Man's Turn."  People would get killed on it all the time.  But then, a judge's daughter looses control - and whamo!  Tiffany gets buried in her cheerleader uniform.  Construction begins on making Dead Man's turn safer before the body gets cold.

I did my thesis on encryption, so I know a thing or two about it.  You'd make a great stepdad, kiddo.  Quit while you're behind.  Why is PGP dead?  Because its a pain in the ass to use.

Ok..  by that philosophy there shouldn't be airbags or seat belts in cars.  If you don't drive perfectly, in perfect weather during the daytime, there's no need.  
Yes, there are problems with stupid people, but here in the real world "shit happens."  Tires blow out, even under perfect conditions.  People can watch over your shoulder as you login - anything can happen.  You'd make a great IT guy.

I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you OK?  You probably got dumber as a result.  But don't worry, a few hours on Luminosity should compensate!

It was part of the punchline.
I just got to the university’s library, sat down at a study kiosk, and I have to fart so bad I’m scared to move.  I can’t guarantee it will be silent or that it won’t waft to the entire floor.
