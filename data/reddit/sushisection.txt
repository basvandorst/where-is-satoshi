I disagree, unfortunately. People, especially americans, have been conditioned to choose a team. The elites know this and actively create divisions in order to maintain control, and the internet is helping them. 
Let me give you an example. A big one is the police brutality hoopla that's been going on the last few years. The media has created this issue to be one of race rather than one of class or of government abuse. This divides the white lower class from the black lower class *even though they are on the same team* (how? Police brutality is a consequence of a lack of government accountability, which pervades every level of govt up to the president. James Clapper lying to congress without any recourse is exactly the same as a cop unjustly killing a man and getting away with it, the same as Dick Cheney creating an international torture program against the Geneva conventions and not being tried as a war criminal).... sorry I digress. The internet helps to create divisions by creating echo chambers for people. So average white american guy sides with the cop. But this guy only reads blogs written by other average white guys who share his same views, and he only listens to right wing radio and only gets his news from right wing websites.... *even though he has access to the free flow of information, he chooses to tune into a very narrow band of information which supports his political viewpoints*. 
The same goes with people on the other side of the political spectrum. Just look at Reddit. 
Edit: to finish my thought.... I think only a small portion of the population is capable/willing to receive information outside of their mental box. Most people rely on others to tell them what to think. They rely on their pastor, they rely on the man on tv, they rely on anon on reddit, and they can't understand life from a perspective outside of that. This isn't going to stop any time soon.

Why? 
Operate it like a debit card with PIN. And seriously , do you really think bitcoin could has mass adoption without a card system? 
I think it's necessary for the transition
@_date: 2015-06-05 22:17:05
Inform us how it can be abused.... obviously you are more informed on the matter than we are
@_date: 2015-06-05 22:14:20


That is until someone creates a Bitcoin card. 
As someone who wants to spend my bitcoin right now to buy food and gas, a bitcoin card would be the final piece in my transition into using bitcoin for everything. And I think it's safe to say that this mentality is shared with many people

That's modern conservatism in a nutshell. But Rand Paul is at least competent and sticks up for our civil rights, and that alone is enough to give him some respect 
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:30:08
I understand you guys have to comply with the law, but I have to ask, how do you determine if a customer is engaging in illegal activity? 
I'm concerned that I one day I will buy something legal with bitcoin, like a tattoo or a piece of art, and then will have to argue my innocence to the police.

Their official strategy is "keep telling the public that we are different than the republicans, but then turn around and vote alongside our rightist brethren"
@_date: 2015-05-28 01:21:01
But the question is, do those who want power manipulate the majority to join their cause or do these groups arise naturally? 
For example, the ultra - conservative/religious right in America. How much does the words of the right wing media and preachers sway the opinion of their audience? If they collectively said tomorrow that the moon was made of cheese, how many people would blindly believe them? 
@_date: 2015-05-28 16:49:12
That's come back to my original point.... you can't really blame the masses for being stupid, but instead point your finger at the powerful elite who manipulate them. 
This shit is going on all over the world.

Only up to a point. There are billionaires who made their money from interest, literally got rich doing nothing. There are billionaires who, yes contributed to society, but have offshore bank accounts and don't pay taxes to their home country. There are multinational corporations that make quarterly profits and utilize shady loopholes to avoid paying taxes in their home country. 
I don't give a fuck if they got rich helping people, they still need to pay taxes if they want to live here. That's the fucking deal. They use our roads, they are protected by our military and police force, they have to pay taxes.

What does this have to do with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:37:05

I just bought Total War Warhammer with bitcoin a few days ago. Like damn, I could have an extra 20 bucks right now

Through Steam, they accept bitcoin now.
I was going to purchase from an online vendor called GreenMan Gaming. They have deals all the time and usually sell AAA games cheaper than Steam. They also used to accept bitcoin but I believe they are going through some development issues right now and had to get rid of bitcoin payments temporarily. 
Btw, TW:W is a great game.

@_date: 2016-06-14 04:49:29
Yeah, but at the same time I feel like it's more important to transact with bitcoin rather than have it sit on my computer. Like I feel more apart of "the movement" when im spending btc, it legitimizes the currency. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 21:52:04
You know what happens when something gets banned from the government? It becomes rare, and the price goes up. A single government cannot control a global market, and there are so many free market sanctuary countries in the world, even a concerted effort to stop bitcoin can't happen. Businesses will just move to another location.  
@_date: 2017-01-23 21:53:31
Bitcoin would just move to the black market and the price would skyrocket.  
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:01:18
For real. They gotta have a "voice" in DC
@_date: 2017-01-23 23:55:21
What percentage of  bitcoin is currently being spent on legal goods versus what is being spent on illegal goods? 
If the majority is being spent on illegal goods, then the market wouldn't really change if governments banned bitcoin. People will find a way to exchange bitcoin into fiat, the law isn't that powerful.  
And if the demand for bitcoin business is lucrative enough, people will find a way to move their business or else their competitors will and gain an advantage. Yeah its not easy, but it is profitable, and thus its worth doing.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:25:57
Lol corrections. The s&amp;p hasnt corrected in like a decade

And guess what, if the internet goes down, the stock market goes down too. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:03:34
The US government had their chance to shut down bitcoin, and they didnt. They accepted it, slapped a tax on it, and now a lot of banks and institutions trade it. And the short term return wouldve made you and your clients a fuck ton of cash if you traded it like any other commodity. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:28:07

Bitcoin never goes low anymore though so its hard to predict on a long term basis. Buy low, sell high only works right now if you are day trading this thing

@_date: 2017-11-10 16:30:23
The average person doesn't need to know bitcoin as long as the nerds in the financial sector are using it in the back end. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:08:22
I mean thats IT in a nutshell, cryptocurrencies really aren't that different.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:04:58
I just find it funny how the people worrying about a bitcoin correction aren't shitting bricks when thinking about an s&amp;p correction. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:08:41
Dude ive watched the price of bitcoin go from 12 bucks to 200 buck to 2000 to 7000. And all along the way ive heard people say, "oh its a scam. It wont last. It wont hit 100 bucks. It wont hit 1000 bucks. It wont hit 10,000 bucks", and they are wrong every time. 
Then i look at the financial institutions, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and they are all accepting bitcoin with open arms.
So tell me, what knowledge about bitcoin do you have that Merrill Lynch doesnt? Why do you think its a scam and the financial institutions dont?

I think it's because (I assume) most people in this sub are pro-drug and thus any mention of bitcoin being used for drug deals is shrugged off.

I agree. But I think he's a little too old to understand it? To my knowledge, he hasn't said anything about bitcoin publicly.
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:05:53

It's fire.
Fire has made our life better, it allows us to cook food, it allows us to build and create out of raw materials, and it allows us to travel far distances.
Fire has also harmed us greatly. It allows us to kill others instantly, and it allows us to brutally kill thousands in a matter of seconds. 
Now ask yourself, should fire be outlawed simply because it can be used for harm?

The bitcoin system could help us with that

That doesn't make sense. If I get a bitcoin from a guy who got it from a guy who got it from a guy who got it from a drug dealer, somehow the starbucks on my corner will know that and deem the bitcoin less valuable? Oh and the only way for this to happen is if the government enforces it.

I still have to disagree. Nation states are required for large populations, and in a world with over 7 billion people, a lot of nation states are required. And here is why: by your definition, a nation state is a monopoly on theft and aggression. What is the alternative? Many different groups fighting for that monopoly on theft and aggression, literally fighting for it. You get rid of that nation state, and others will arise trying to fill its place. Its *natural* with human populations numbered in the millions. Decentralizing technology is not going to destroy countries, only other countries (or in-fighting) can do that. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 20:48:31
Empires collapse and give rise to new nations. 
Law and governance has been around since the dawn of time, and a transition into a new economic model is not going to get rid of it. Nation states arise organically when a given population needs to allocate resources and to protect itself.

Its natural for a given population to form some sort of political structure. Even tribes have leaders. 
Just look at the middle east. Association by birth is the main form of politics in that region. ISIS is trying to form their own nation state right now, one which is not governed by man but by their god and their beliefs. This is not a new concept. The idea of homeland is very poweful. Since the dawn of man, people have died protecting their homeland. Its ingrained in us. Governance and nation states are just an offshoot of that idea.

I don't know specifics about the crisis so I'd rather not argue you about it haha. But if you want to lay it out for the rest of the internet, go ahead. I'm actually interested to hear your case. 


I don't endorse it. I'd rather see the banks fail and society learn from their mistake. But you do make an interesting point, that the regulatory bodies insulate these financial institutions and create a closed market. It's seems as though the Fed incentives bad behavior and the banks are acting accordingly.

Doesn't matter. Bitcoin is a global financial system, visa/mastercard only operate in a couple countries. If they shut down bitcoin in the US, the industry will simply move to another country.

I don't have much knowledge on international payment systems so take this idea with a grain of salt, but what if businesses demand the use of bitcoin on the back end to more efficiently pay their foreign workers. Those shitty oligarchs would have to adhere to their corporate

People also aren't informed in the many applications of bitcoin, how it can revolutionize global trading, how it can give banking to billions of people worldwide... The naysayers in the west are used to their credit cards and bank accounts and don't realize that most of the world doesn't have access to those.

Mods on a bitcoin forum are used as thought police... how ironic

Not a lawyer, but I think there is a fair case to be made that drug *user* laws are unconstitutional against the 8th amendment, "cruel and unusual punishment" especially when coupled with mandatory minimum laws... locking someone up for at least 5 years because they were caught with less than a gram of weed seems very cruel and unusual.

Governments won't, but banks and businesses will once they realize how much money and time they save by using it.

Well for one, it supports bitcoin

It's a double edged sword. 
The repeal of the Glass Stegall Act allowed banks to take extreme risks with no accountability, causing the financial crisis. Dodd Frank is an attempt to make sure that doesn't happen again. 
So what would you rather have, large financial institutions making deals doomed to fail with no accountability or an overreaching regulatory bureaucracy?
Edit: obviously there is a middle ground somewhere to be made here. But this is America damnit, there is no middle ground.

Its not really "get rich quick", more like "get rich after 30 years"

Thanks. I literally just got Mycelium and sent an email asking the devs about this backup system. You just answered my question.
Edit: stay away from fires. Gotcha.
