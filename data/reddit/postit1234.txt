@_date: 2018-08-14 02:09:12
lol i love this sub. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:46:50
what that u own .05 btc? My credibility is i made a big profit selling at 14k. im willing to buyback once there is hype. but hype is ded. btc runs on 100% hype. this is not a currency at all.  trends for btc search is ded
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:36:09
you sound like a gambling addict, coming up with hopeless reasons
@_date: 2018-08-14 11:47:11

@_date: 2018-08-14 03:11:05
for the noobs who bought at 18k and are still HODL
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:10:02
lol stop it you sound silly
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:12:08
Lool no matter what you tell them, they delusional . Im glad i sold at 14. i will buy back if crypto becomes a “thing” again like 2017. ill enjoy my wins for now
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:27:37
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:22:30
never said that. but tbh, you just sound salty AF that youre losing in whatever investments you have. dont get me wrong , im all for crypto and its purpose, but people like you need to stop being delusional and cut to facts. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:13:55
this subreddit and the Hodl warriors are delusional at times. know when to pull out. you guys sound like compulsive gamblers. im glad i sold at 14k after reaching the ATH last year. nothin wrong with profits. obviously theres no hype in crypto anymore. i dont see this being adopted as an actual currency as of now. i will buy back in once we see true trends towards global adoption. right now , theres zero hype. this aint 2017
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:25:16
im no troll. ive been on here to help yall out since my first post earlier this year. but you guys are so stubborn and cant handle the truth rationally. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:42:24
I dont but i wish i did. more money in banking than post 2017 crypto. i was all for cyrpto when it was bull in late 2017. but cashed out soon after and happy that i did.
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:44:16
No. 20k was the moon but that hype train got derailed. so many people were hopeful of adoption but in reality, no one really talks or is interested anymore. everyone says “x amount is the bottom.” but keeps going down and down. its a gamble at this point. put that money towards an ira or some real form of investment. btc was a good gamble for me last yr thankfully.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:48:18
cant handle truth. you sound so immature
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:28:55
not here to shitpost. here to spread awareness that yall are buying into a losing investment. how many times is this sub gnna lie to themselves predicting new bottom dollars. there have been endless of those predictions and clearly no one knows what the fk theyre talking about.
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:40:02
your throwing money away. stop buying btc. its a dying investment 
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:09:12
i wish i was a banker. cant rely on a “currency” that swings 10% a day. thats not currency. that gambling
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:26:29
u give me too much credit. its just common sense. i wish i had multiple to sell. but only had 1.5 and sold at 14k. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:33:25
if youre gnna continue to throw money out the window please send me some fiat via paypal. cash is king my friend. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:43:01
long ago as in earlier this year. no one knew of btc existence until 2017. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:07:53
This is perfect representation of this sub. people cant handle the truth
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:50:22
i heard about btc since btc was at 1.2k and bought in then. then i sold at 14 ealrier this year. my post is for those like me who bought in 2017 or even 2018.
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:39:52
its about profits. profits only occured with hype.
i pulledout before hype died. theres no profit in the crypto game anymore. just trying to help others out by speaking truth . truth hurts sometimes
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:42:14
cus im trying to spread the truth. here to help
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:36:28
i know 
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:04:25
lmao this sub so cringy.  crypto is ded ppl. it runs on 100% hype and FUD. its not currency. its gambling
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:52:48
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:32:29
thats a flawed rule. everyone posts about price everyday because price is dropping every day. btc main purpose is price and value.  what other purpose wiuld this sub serve other than that? 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:46:12
Bought 1 btc at 1.2k for funsies. did some Hodl. Sodl long ago @ 14. i admit i got greeedy at 19k thinking it would keep going. but i realized. why should i have my money hostage in this dying trend post 2017 decmeber.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:35:09
proves me point. sub cant handle the simple truth. tells alot about your personality.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:21:53
you still holding there little buddy? hope ur not in debt
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:43:47
keep lying to yourselves
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:41:45
its the internet my friend. u have no control
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:46:22
stop spreading false hope. crypto hype is done. no ones as interested and full adoption will never be universal. lets just be real with ourselves and mitigate the losses. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:38:23
SODL. its time to sell. btc is ded
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:47:31
my point is for the average joes who joined the hype train. people bought in not too long ago and are losijg $ ever since. if you bought in at .50 cent, think of how much more ROI you could have had earlier thsi year. youre still in a good position but the trend is going downwards. sell my friend
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:18:51
are you thinking what im thinking
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:38:42
LOL what peace. how can you live in peace when your money is going down the shitter everyday. id be fking depressed ever since it dropped below 10k. ive been telling yall to SELLL long ago. you need to Mitigate losses my friends.
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:17:56
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:21:20
i understand the purpose this technology serves. but it wont make a difference when mass adoption will never occur. im glad is FuD at 14k. made a nice chunk and paid of school loan. it was fun while it lasted
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:48:23
