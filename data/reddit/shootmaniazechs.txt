I think it'd be a good switch to make, but only when it's so established​ that we know it won't crash and burn. At the moment, the huge value of one btc is playing a big part in why people are talking about it, which is doing huge amounts of good for bitcoin's acceptance; helping it become part of the fabric of society.

I unfortunately bought miners from bfl. By the time they arrived, they were costing more to run than they mined, though I kept them on for a bit in hopes of a value increase. 
As a result, the 1.5 btc and 0.5 ltc I have are just sitting in my wallets, I'm too scared to do anything with them. I bet most people reading this will say I'm being useless for the economy but I don't know enough about it to do anything else. I guess I'm hoping that the price will rocket in 20 years and my mortgage will be paid off 
Edit:  any advice would be much appreciated. I haven't really followed the btc developments in the last 2 years

I'm way out of the loop and really don't understand what's going on with block chain. I have a coin in my wallet, is it at risk of disappearing if I don't act soon?

Do i need to do anything to maintain control of my wallet as a result of this?
Eg last time there was a big wallet upgrade which made it a pain to recover

To anyone who understands bitcoin better than me, could it realistically reach 1 mil? Could it go beyond and actually become the de facto currency? And what about other crypto like litecoin and ethereum, would their success damage/compete with bitcoin?

Interesting comparison, thanks for the info

anybode else notice how ALL of their customer service employees are women? 
Jody on the forums, you mentioned Emily, and i've had an email from Alicia.
Methinks they're making up names, and it's actually one guy in a basement

I spent $700 on the same two 7gh/s miners. They worked fine for nearly 2 weeks, and now the power supply on one has developed a problem. after running for 5 minutes it seems to heat up and short circuit my house.
I emailed them and got no response

yeah i was exaggerating about the basement.
it's a well known thing in business to send email correspondance under female names; for some reason it gives more positive results. i have no doubt that they're doing this, and i don't have a problem with it either
