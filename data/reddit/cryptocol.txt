This makes me think. Perhaps Satoshi has spent his coins, just not yet. He came back in time, he created bitcoin, and then he went back (or should it be forward) and then had all his coins, at a massive worth. It would explain a few things.

It used to confuse me too back in 2050 but it's all clear to me now.

How does it work for crypto speculation?
I watched as bitcoin rose from less than $10 to what it is now, but only just has my life allowed me to be able to invest what I can afford to lose, even if not much. I want to catch the train later rather than never but I'm not sure what the general approach is.

Only job on there...

I got in recently too, but it's fine, because I'm averaging my investments month by month, so over the grand scheme, it will work out. Had I waited a few more days, sure, I'd have saved $100...which I may spend on a dinner one night... so unless you've joined and gone all in then we should be fine.

Stupid bot, I know.

Thanks, I think I'm being thrown off by number 4... '92 helps but I'm stuck working out whether it's a significant book or whether it really is just a cooking book... I'm sure I have 2 and 3 easily (even if 3 a decimal), and if 5 isn't flatirons, then as a non-US citizen (UK), I don't really know enough to guess this one!
Tough quiz.

I give up, my time spent on this has now far outweighed the reward.

I'm new to HODL and I enjoyed this.
There are two things that have cheered me up since I joined the HODLers at $2600. Someone sent me [this]( and your gif. So thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:07:09
thank you, I can use that to get an idea of parameters
@_date: 2017-06-29 12:33:05
that's the thing, I don't know, there are so many unknowns.
every question could have multiple answers...
    &gt;&gt; 25149 
    &gt;&gt; 25148 
    &gt;&gt; 25147 
    &gt;&gt; 25146 
    &gt;&gt; 25145 
    &gt;&gt; 25144 
    &gt;&gt; 25143 
    &gt;&gt; 25142 
    &gt;&gt; 25141 
    &gt;&gt; 25140 
    &gt;&gt; 25139 
    &gt;&gt; 25138 
    &gt;&gt; 25137 
    &gt;&gt; 25136 
    &gt;&gt; 25135 
    &gt;&gt; 25134 
    &gt;&gt; 25133 
    &gt;&gt; 25132 
    &gt;&gt; 25131 
    &gt;&gt; 25130 
    &gt;&gt; 25129 
    &gt;&gt; 25128 
the potential permutations are untenable!
@_date: 2017-06-29 10:29:27
I've checked a thousand so far. It's driving me insane.
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:51:27
yep, I've checked 5000 combinations so far and still nothing.
@_date: 2017-06-30 07:07:04
finished without success... one of the answers is definitely something that nobody has mentioned. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 09:27:51
Scammy? What is being scammed? Your free time?
@_date: 2017-06-29 10:04:14
This is great fun, but I'm wondering if there are any "rules"?
So it works with the URL, but _any_ character can go in a URL if you URL encode it. Should I be expecting to put "Florence, Italy" because it's URL acceptable?
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:11:03
That is one thing we know, that they are lowercase.
What we don't know is whether it's a name, a book, or what.
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:11:25
I've done about 10,000 so far. I've lost track of all my guesses. Taking a break as this is doing my nut in.
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:52:58
Thanks, so far I've tried about 5000 combinations with no luck. Got 15000 more to go before I have to go back to the drawing board. It's tough because you could have 4/5 and have no idea which is the wrong one.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:24:46
some of us exist per occasion 
@_date: 2017-06-30 07:02:17
Running another 1000ish checks.
@_date: 2017-06-28 08:51:20
Ah, dollar cost averaging can help to alleviate this risk!
