Nah we shouldn’t be splitting bitcoin into two cryptos, it’s bad enough with bitcoin and bitcoin cash, and that’s ignoring the other shit forks from bitcoin 
All bitcoins should be backed by the original blockchain

Because gdax pays the fees, not you 
If you were ever to use those bitcoins for another transaction from your non gdax wallet, you’ll have to pay the fees then

No such thing as a lightning bitcoin 
It’s all just normal bitcoins 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:41:12
Poatpones it until segwit adoption is higher and lightning network is ready for mainstream use
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:17:02
No way of just creating a new SegWit address then?
Sucks but I guess it’s viable now fees are lower

Because it's not a problem coinbase can solve, it's an issue with the bitcoin network being clogged with transactions
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:39:36
There isn’t one and I never claimed there was
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:18:17
According to this blog post they have 
I didn't have BCC on coinbase when it was released on August 1st and therefore can't verify that they've actually done this, but as the BCC wallet is the same as a BTC wallet unless they lost their private keys they should have an identical amount of BTC to BCC ignoring any insider trading that may have happened.
And if they haven't got their BCC then the issue is entrusting your money with a 3rd party company - not your private keys, not your bitcoins after all.

Is there a way to do this with electrum?
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:24:01
So in the last two years it's increased an awful lot, which is what many people mean when they say that fees have increase - they have relative to recent history, and for an awful long time it looks like the the trend was for fees to decrease.
We haven't seen fees this high since around the end of 2013
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:15:34
They're an integral part, but nothing in the white paper says fees must be high or low, only that "Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees"
Since there's still many many years until that point is reached, it makes sense that most income should still come from mining, not fees

....you can already withdraw and deposit BCC from Coinbase I think
You just can't buy it and sell it for fiat, so you'll just need to send it to a different exchange where you can
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:56:10
Looks like you set a [massively low fee]( meaning a lot of miners will ignore it for a long time.
I'm in the same boat as you with a similarly low fee taking ages, you'll just have to wait.
In the event that the transaction never completes, eventually the money will be returned to the sender once it's removed from the mempool I believe.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:47:21
And I never said it wasn’t, your point is?

If we’re going by your logic then you must also agree that [SegWit]( has less utility given it’s similar market share to [Bitcoin Cash]( I guess this mean the “SegWit” narrative is equally false.
Or maybe it’s a case that you can’t judge a technology by its current adoption, and maybe that Bitcoin has room for both SegWit and bigger blocks

The LTC network isn't nearly as clogged as bitcoin, however it is the busiest it's been ever
According to  it's around 300 - 500 pending transactions right now, however it was around 800 earlier when I sent mine to coinbase, so it's high traffic but not exactly clogged
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:46:26
All of the other coins generally have trading pairs with BTC - because of this all other altcoins are linked to the BTC price somewhat, so when BTC has rises they do and when BTC falls so do they.

If you read my comment then you'd know what
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:45:19
For bitcoiners that don't know, this is what other people in the UK commonly refer to as "someone who is for some reason against people voicing their concerns about brexit"
Because brexit has made everything so fucking polarised the debate has devolved into name calling, where all remainers are now "remoaners" against the will of the people and leave voters are apparently xenophobic racists -- both of which are wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:53:21
What fees did you set for LTC? I've personally found a transaction will only take around half an hour and I only used a fee of 0.001 LTC
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:17:33
Fees in satoshi per byte have increased 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:23:14
They have less transactions because there’s less people using it, not because it can’t support a higher amount of transactions 
It doesn’t matter how big your blocks are - if less people are using it, there’s going to be less transactions a second 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:47:00
Not sure, maybe a fee of 0.0001 LTC is too low or something?
I doubt it's an issue with the ledger nano or bittrex - an unconfirmed transaction on the blockchain is a pending transaction.
If it's anything like bitcoin, eventually the funds will return to your wallet once it's been unconfirmed for too long - until then you'll just have to wait like I am with my bitcoins :/

So you're saying the hard fork has had better adoption than segwit did at this stage? 
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:20:05
That's not capitalism? Why not? In a fully capitalist state, what's stopping someone with vast amounts of wealth from using it to impose their will?
You sound just like the commies that say that every current and past communist state wasn't actually communist

Spend it at stores which accept bitcoin directly then

I don’t know much about the technical aspects, but surely moving everything to a segwit wallet is harder than just opening the wallet private key in BCC? 
BCC is as easy to implement as a new currency as it is a different currency, whereas ensuring Coinbase is segwit compatible means moving at least some bitcoins to separate segwit wallet 
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:09:47
My ideal segwit2x is one supported by the main bitcoin core devs, with development of bitcoin remaining as it is right now, except with 2MB blocks 
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:47:46
Exactly where as access to your bcc was promised before the fork so more engineering effort went into that 
It's too late now, but I still think a proper 2x hard fork would've got everyone on segwit, and bcc wouldn't have gotten any traction
