If you think it reached the top of the bubble, then please sell and give the chance to others who believe in it to own it.

Be easy on him guys. He is human and needs to vent a bit. Listen more and criticize less.

I sent BTC yesterday, paid 6 usd on fees and started getting confirmation within an hour. Maybe it is because I am using segwit address? 
@_date: 2018-05-28 23:21:53
Wow. This seems legit. I am all in. Voted! 
@_date: 2018-08-11 10:26:40
Bitmain = BCH bag holder.
@_date: 2018-08-11 10:35:16
Bitmain needs to dump good amount of its mined BCH coins to pay the bills. With not many buyers around, it is natural that BCH price tanks. Mining profits are about to get razor thin for them.

That UC stand for University of China? 
@_date: 2018-06-04 13:36:35
Yup, just look at the crypto-related news in Japan and you will see who is really pulling the strings there. Kitao-san, you better wake up or get rekt.
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:19:23
Bitcoin transactions feels like sex, specially those with high value and low fees. The feeling keeps going watching those newer blocks coming on top.
Banks transactions, specifically swift ones, must feel like being gang raped by the all the participant banks. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 20:50:54
Exactly, the say that right before chopping your head off. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 07:16:21
That's your buy signal bois! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:31:32
I think is already low but if you feel i will go down more, split your buy orders all the way down. Roger is about to run out of gas.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:37:32
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:13:01
Not war. They are about to see what global market forces are all about.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:05:01
It is weekend guys, Roger et.al manipulating the market as usual. Just see the very suspicious volumenes from Bithumb. So good chance to get more coins cheap. Split your orders and buy on its way down.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:51:29
+2 billion pump from a single Korean exchange. I hope they continue for the cheap BTC but too obvious.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:01:09
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:08:25
More than a billion on just Bithumb's BCH/KRW pair...
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:23:55
Not much as last weekend. More whales are aware now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:35:40
Double down man! Bet the other one when it hits $100,000 USD but be very conservative with the time!
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:58:56
Our Shaman Andreas!
That made my day after thus crazy pump and dump. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:30:55
Good for the ones who profited, bad for ones who lost and hell is coming to the market manipulators.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:35:54
Do not forget to stick the label 'please be sweet when you kidnap me' on it 
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:45:23
Come on. He is very serious.
Remember when he told us that everything with Mtgox will be fine?
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:43:52
Let them sell and learn.
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:01:58
Yeah, nice roller coaster brought to you by 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:38:21
The other day I read a Japanese guy writing something similar on Bitflyer chat.
"I am finally getting laid!"
Interesting what moon means to each individual.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:54:42
I will not disclose who I am but just trust me, HFT has been having an eye on it for long time. Any juicy opportunity and they will take it.
They will not definitely let BCH mess up with CME BTC derivatives being launched soon. So Roger and friends are peanuts compared to them. Enjoy the show.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:02:04
That is only the usual BCH pump. I do not think it will last.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:00:30
Do not forget the life insurance. Cardiac arrest is becoming popular in the crypto space nowadays.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:07:54
Be wise and split your buy orders
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:05:20
Of course. He is going to help taking BTC to the next level. I know he will not let us down. Very skilled and will not break his reputation for anyone. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:37:32
Yup, and that is going to go-live in a few hours more. My mining rig is ready :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:59:37
Agree. It should be our bitcoin shaman. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:23:50
The guy is a joke who thinks Bitcoin is a religion. I am still green but after this shock I need to watch 10 videos of my Shaman Andreas for proper healing.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:22:53
Because of the animated bcash logo that rotates counter clock-wise ?
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:33:42
Well looks like he is doing now. Grabbing all those yummy cheap coins now until he goes broke.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:20:26
They were not just moving some coins, they manipulated the market. I won't be surprised that the SEC audits Bitfinex, the Korean FSS do the same to Bithumb and perhaps Japan FSA.
I won't be surprised that regulators start requiring exchanges to have proper circuit breakers.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:44:07
Beside risking voiding your warranty, for sure you are going to degrade one of the most expensive components which is the battery. I have a friend who bricked his Tesla for leaving it discharged for a few weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:31:43
Roger has a Lamborghini but I heard rumors that Satoshi owns a Tesla Roadster. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:31:27
Fsck Lambo! The Roadster is for real Bitcoiners!!!
Unless you want to be like Roger.

And BTG is coming live in just a few hours. Do not be surprised if it put BCH out of its misery.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:02:03
Punish? I bought my last coins at $3000 and enjoying the show. I hope the Koreans continue dumping until payday.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:59:54
Wait for BTG to suck the life out of BCH
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:06:38
Wondering why so many fugitives or convicted felons move to Japan...
Somehow I have the urge of learning Japanese now. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:11:43
The whales are way younger than you think
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:47:50
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:09:30
Let them pump a bit more. All the missiles are aiming at them on Monday morning when market opens or earlier. We got some HFT guys ready (specially in Korea) to bring them down too and BTG is lauching in a few hours. That will drain the life out of BCH.
In the meantime, let's continue educating people and institutions with the facts. No need to attack anyone. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:25:44
I can also show a very truthful face if I get to keep (or even increase) my coins holdings after that statement
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:16:46
Unless you are Goldman, JPMorgan, et al the last thing you want to do is to mess with the regulators. They like snacks. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:43:29
I cannot get tired of telling people that they do not get to choose their nickname. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:25:31
It is afternoon in asia
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:44:31
Come on. It is just one exchange pumping.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:41:03
People from Korea on Sunday. Sure!
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:33:11
No one will win including Roger himself. No one will ever trust Cryptocurrencies and it will be many years after this gets back to normal.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:00:38
Is our lovely friend pumping BCH again. He is online now and active in reddit too
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:09:04
Andreas is my Shaman!
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:35:40
Looks like this was the original plan. 2X was a decoy
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:12:43
Great, let's get all these facts right so we can have people checking with regulators. He may be breaking some laws already. Japan and Korea regulators might be interested. It is going to be very useful for the post-mortem
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:43:29
That should not surprise you
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:16:22
There is no win for Roger now. Things are past the point of return. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:23:59
Agree. 2 week redditor alert 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:50:30
No but market manipulation is. Japan FSA and Korean FSS are very strict. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:03:15
I also could notice that r/btc is active during Asian hours. New here so not sure how to hard prove it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:03:33
And they will bite the bullet and move back again.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:40:40
You are right. Evidence is pilling up. Too bad Roger did not think it through the consequences of messing up with big fishes in Asia, specially the ones close to regulators. He is about to know the real meaning of "Do not shit where you eat"
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:36:18
Not selling any and just watching Roger going backrupt
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:53:59
I finally got it. Most of the (Korean) people are switching back to bcash. It is clear now.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:23:29
According to the book written by friend I met in a Bitcoin Meetup years ago, Satoshi owns a Tesla Roadster. 
Entertaining book if you have plenty of time to kill
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:37:23
It is just Roger and co pumping BCH at bithumb. It passed 1.6 billions USD 24hr volumen 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:50:34
As soon as "the koreans" pumping BCH give way, BTC will soar to the stratosphere.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:38:45
Normal markets. It will start when Asia opens as bank money transfers flow to the exchanges. Until that Roget can keep pumping from Bithumb and Bitfinex
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:51:38
Usually the original Teslas are second cars, so most of the people store it during winter. Looks like someone unplugged the cord without plugging it back. Of course, Tesla did the battey replacement. The bill was around 30 grands!
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:11:45
Nice. Let me know when you sell.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:38:53
RIP to the weak hands though. I have been around for many years already so I have learned my lesson :)
@_date: 2018-03-29 00:55:17
For non-technical stuff better use the likelihood of something.
I would say: It is very likely that Szabo is part of the group (along with Wei Dai, and Hal Finney) behind Satoshi. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 00:04:37
Sorry folks, it is hard to look at her and not feeling like a bull.

Being half Greek, he seems to be Shaman indeed. From Wikipedia:
Shamans are normally "called" by dreams or signs which require lengthy training. However, shamanic powers may be "inherited".
@_date: 2018-07-14 06:05:49
This is their normal practice to put naive investors on the wrong side of the bet.

He can be a good comedian after crypto put him out of the job. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 01:38:58
Good reading. Just avoid naming your kid "Satoshi" or something similar. In the 90's some of my zealot friends named their kids "Linus" after Linux god Linus Tordvalds.
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:47:19
That is Jeff's plan B
