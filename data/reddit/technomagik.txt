Shapeshift is already paying taxes, failure to pursue criminal prosecution would be misuse of customer funds.

Another problem that Kerberos and real hardware two-factor authentication could have solved. Hell even just a decent Kerberos server running on OpenBSD with some decent policies would have made this a lot easier to manage and mitigated losses significantly. SSH keys are convenient, and horrible operational security. You don't know if someone's got your multisig secret or your ssh authentication secrets until it's too late.
But Kerberos is hard, you know, and Multisig is the new 2016 blockchain buzzword compliant "solution to everything" right?

Oh jeezus christ on a stick. At least you updated the repo to say it's inactive and linked to openbaazar.
If you are going to call something 'Dark Market' it would be far more subversive to give me code so I can trade corn futures and arrange physical delivery settlements with a real dark market exchange.

My guess is Gavin's paycheck is somehow tied to an organization that has invested in controlling a large percentage of the hash rate, and sees a competitive advantage to be able to shut down, delay, or block transactions that compete with their business model.

I think the financial press tends to miss something very important about open source software, as well as owner-operators, like farmers and the  (non-industrial) miners.
They do this because it's a lifestyle, not because it makes money. There is no way a for-profit business (visa, microsoft, corporate farms) can compete with bitcoin, linux, or farm owner-operators. The startups, for-profit companies, and industrial miners all have to pay rent and make loan payments.
Now what gets really interesting is when some farmer combines all three with [crypto-commodites](
The value of the blockchain isn't in the value of bitcoin, it's in providing an infrastructure for distributed global commodities trading directly between people that grow the food and the people that eat it.

Dividing a bitcoin is all well and good, but bitcoin value/supply is a one-way function, and is completely in-elastic. As soon as there is a widely used [Hayek money]( cryptocurrency, I expect people with goods to trade will quickly start using it because of lower futures volatility risk.
When that happens, Bitcoin will either have to adopt an elastic money supply algorithm, or experience a dramatic price crash. The only question is will the loss be spread out among all bitcoin holders fairly, or will the losses be concentrated in the naive speculators?

And this is different than the religious nuts that assert that a hard limit of 21 million coins is a good thing?
Bitcoin is full of religious nuts. I find LukeJR's open expression of his beliefs refreshing. A number of other developers seem to worship some kind of perverted libertarianism and others worship the almighty dollar that pays their salary. But Lukejr is one of the few that tend to make their religious views public.

Make it like 'USDA certified organic', which, while it is a complete racket bought and paid for by campaign contributors, has been a great success in the marketplace.
I see no reason that New York cannot set the world standard for regulatory capture AND still allow farmers to trade [crypto-commodities]( without posting an outrageous bond.

If Theo De Raadt released OpenBitcoin I'd switch immediatly. He'd never have allowed the bogus code that enabled remote key compromises by heartbleed.
Assholes they may be, but the assholes are the best centralization-attack early warning sirens we have.

This is not a goddamned democracy. The people that code make the rules.
So learn to code or stop complaining, or those of us that do might replace you with a very small shell script.
Or hire me to release Catoshi for Bitcoin and blacklist Eligius ;)

Or you could use the billions in media outlets you already own for market manipulation, hire some hackers and hashrate to attack a large bitcoin exchange, and get the exchange to blame the attack on a bitcoin bug, then pay some developers to blame the exchange, and then scoop up millions worth of bitcoins for 10% of the price.
Add more mining, pump the price again, launder the money, rinse, repeat.
Oh sorry, someone already did that.
Question for you: Doesn't limited supply of miners mean all you need to do is kidnap a relative of someone who owns or has admin access to 30% of the hashrate, and then start DOSing some mining pools?
@_date: 2014-01-08 22:58:53
I'd just settle for a simple system to get feedback from the catcoin community that doesn't involve yet-another-online-poll site on how to deal with coin-hoppers.

I do not seen how kimoto gravity well maintains cryptographic integrity of of confirmations in a 'hash withdrawal' attack.
Suppose mr bad hires 10 gigahash on an altcoin with 1 gigahash and spikes the difficulty. He drives profitability in the toilet for everyone else, and half of it goes somewhere else.
Now mr bad profit-switches 9 gigahash to something else, but leaves 1gigahash mining an *off-network* private chain.
KGW adjusts the difficulty back down for the remaining 0.5 Ghash, and merchants go about accepting payments and think everything is great for say 6-10 blocks.
Now mr bad releases his gigahash chain which has double the proof-of-work, and he's happened to have double spent a few key transactions to lesser-well known exchanges and maybe mining pools.
My point is I think KGW will drop the difficulty too fast for merchants and exchanges to safely accept confirmations without *ALSO* checking if the hashrate has recently dropped. So you still have the same problem, it takes forever to reliably confirm anything after a hash withdrawal.
You can mitigate this by having developers issue checkpoints, but then it's all centralized again.

And just why do you think the price of bitcoin was so low leading up to this 'news'? Someone had to make sure the guys who print the money get a good price

Pretty much, but to really grow your money you need to charge transaction fees for egg &lt;-&gt; eggcoin transactions and make sure you cultivate your eggcoin with some algorithmic trading to keep the pump-and-dumpers under control.

This is an ongoing work-in-progress on being able to build multiple altcoins from the same source code base. 
I would like to merge it up to relatively a relatively recent bitcoin-core version, and I need some altchain users that are willing to test and contribute code to support their favorite alt.
@_date: 2015-07-09 23:09:55
Do you have a mailing list to discuss this refactoring? Since bitcoin-core went to autoconf, I am thinking just making everything work from a QT-creator/Qmake build system. 
The downside of this is it might GPL-encumber the whole thing, which personally I think is a feature, others may not. The benefit is now it becomes a lot easier to build **native** Android and iOS full node wallets.
Take a look at  ... This works *sort of* okay for grantcoin because it's still pretty new and the block count is low. It would blow up when you get big blockchains with a lot of history like doge

so why in the world would anyone take a loan denominated in a deflationary currency?
The promise of built-in price-of-goods deflation with bitcoin is that you'd never take a loan, and if you did, you'd eventually realize you need to default. Why in the world would anyone loan you bitcoin if they knew you would probably default and it would go up in value if they just held it?
Bitcoin is horrible for people who like to inflate the money supply by issuing debt. What do you have to gain by believing what debt-issuers say?

When you hear "too big to fail" from politicans, "Big Data" in reference to the servers needed to house a terabyte blockchain, then it will likely be time to start over.
What I'm trying to figure out is will bitcoin's collapse be a 'flash crash' where all of a sudden nobody takes bitcoin for any real world goods anymore, or if there's going to be a 'soft landing/retirement' devaluation of Bitcoin because someone is willing to either destroy their own coin hoard, or trade for a new cryptocurrency.
I'd love to see some realistic economic models of say 20 years out of blockchain size that has 25% of the world's GDP, and how to 'retire' the old chain for a new one.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:04:11
Here's the problem.. How do you develop and gain adoption for 'the perfect currency' if it takes a lot of time and effort (and mining, if done equitably) to get a new cryptocurrency off the ground.
For instance, a design goal of  is that the total currency in circulation is adjusted in order to have a stable value.
What I can't figure out is how to bootstrap the time It would take me to fork {bit/lite/frei/dev}coin and release a working prototype. Then how do you get people to start using a stable-value currency?
I actually expect there might be *more* short-term volatility in a currency that adjusted total coins and mining difficulty based on a 'consumer price index', because some year you'll have a drought and food and biofuel prices will go up.

Here's what will happen (or has already happened)
1) Government(s) tax bitcoin, and accept it as payment for taxes
2) Lobbyists for Big Mining Firms argue that 'regulation' is needed, and government should destroy (remove from circulation) some percentage of the currency taken in as tax
3) Big Mining Firms hire 'The Developers' and release a patch(es) to continually increase the total number of bitcoins that could be issued, "To reduce bitcoin carbon footprint", or any other number of feel-good excuses
4) 'Independent Developers' (with a large Bitcoin hoard) will find their transactions ignored or blocked by the 'Big Mining Firms', unless they agree

They'll figure it out after I've been selling shipping containers of corn for bitcoin for a couple of years, and a couple of farmers co-ops finally send a post-panamax container vessel loaded with grain over and the farmers get paid directly in a cryptocurrency that includes futures contracts.
Of course, that's also about the time BTC will collapse because everyone figures out the exchanges are the Oligarchs of the bitcoin world.
