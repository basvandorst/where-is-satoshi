From 2008-2013 I refused to open my investment statements I’d receive in the mail.   
Stop opening the statements! Just forget about it! Ride the waves for couple years, put a few bucks in every month and you’ll be fine.  Never regret what you believe to be an good investment.  Save for your future!  In Ten years from now you’ll be rewarded.  BTC will rule the world. No Doubt.  By then the whales should be fairly diluted hopefully and will not have much impact on the price.   Store of value will prevail for pricing and BTC will be as common as the air we breathe!  Governments are only going to fuck things up even more between now and then.  That’s what I’m betting on.  Fucking world governments have fucked us so bad in the past 50 years why would it any different for the next half of century.

This is what’s called building support.  We headed way up over the next several months.  Wait till you see the peaks and valleys once we go over $20 and beyond.  At $100k we will dump and bounce $10k-$30k on a regular basis.   I’d only be worried if we dump all the way back to $4k and sit there for a month.

Hello, darkness, my old friend  
 I've come to talk with you again  
 Because a vision softly creeping  
 Left its seeds while I was sleeping  
 And the vision that was planted in my brain  
 Still remains  
 Within the sound of silence  
   
 In restless dreams I walked alone  
 Narrow streets of cobblestone  
 'Neath the halo of a streetlamp  
 I turned my collar to the cold and damp  
 When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light  
 That split the night  
 And touched the sound of silence  
   
 And in the naked light I saw  
 Ten thousand people, maybe more  
 People talking without speaking  
 People hearing without listening  
 People writing songs that voices never share  
 No one dared  
 Disturb the sound of silence  
   
 "Fools," said I, "You do not know  
 Silence like a cancer grows  
 Hear my words that I might teach you  
 Take my arms that I might reach you."  
 But my words like silent raindrops fell  
 And echoed in the wells of silence  
   
 And the people bowed and prayed  
 To the neon god they made  
 And the sign flashed out its warning  
 In the words that it was forming  
 And the sign said, "The words of the prophets  
 Are written on the subway walls  
 And tenement halls  
 And whispered in the sounds of silence
92750 inbound so try to enjoy.

I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
They're really saying I love you

They'll learn much more than I'll never know

Dust in the wind  
All we are is dust in the wind  
Dust in the wind  
All we are is dust in the wind
I close my eyes  
Only for a moment, then the moment's gone  
All my dreams  
Pass before my eyes, a curiosity  
Dust in the wind  
All we are is dust in the wind
It's the same old song  
We're just a drop of water, in an endless sea  
All we do  
Just crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see  
Dust in the wind  
All we are is dust in the wind
Life's too short brothers and sisters  
Dust in the wind  
All we are is dust in the wind
Don't hang on  
Nothing lasts forever, but the earth and sky  
It's there always  
And all your money won't another minute buy  
Dust, all we are is dust in the wind  
Life's too short brothers and sisters  
Dust, all we are is dust in the wind
Open your eyes you've acquired quite a bit  
Keep your balance don't you slip  
It could all end instantly as you will see  
Time waits for no one, it just moves on  
There is a white one  
Who won't accept the black one  
Who won't accept the yellow one  
Who can't accept the white
When will we learn  
That all we are is dust in the wind  
Time for the healing to begin  
All we is are dust in the wind  
Time for the healing to begin  
All we are is dust in the wind  
Everything is dust in the wind

Standing in the middle of nowhere  
Wondering how to begin  
Lost between tomorrow and yesterday  
Between now and then
And now we're back where we started  
Here we go round again  
Day after day I get up and I say  
I better do it again
Where are all the people going  
Round and round till we reach the end  
One day leading to another  
Get up go out do it again
Then it's back where you started  
Here we go round again  
Back where you started  
Come on do it again
And you think today is going to be better  
Change the world and do it again  
Give it all up and start all over  
You say you will but you don't know when
Then it's back where you started  
Here we go round again  
Day after day I get up and I say  
Come on better do it again
The days go by and you wish you were a different guy  
Different friends and a new set of clothes  
You make alterations and (a fact in you knows)  
A new house a new car a new job a new nose  
But it's superficial and it's only skin deep  
Cause the voices in your head keep shouting in your sleep  
Get back, get back
Back where you started, here we go round again  
Back where you started, come on do it again
Back where you started, here we go round again  
Day after day I get up and I say, do it again  
Do it again  
Day after day I get up and I say, do it again
