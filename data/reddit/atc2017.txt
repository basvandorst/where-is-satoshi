In some recent post I shared an interactive graph I created and update daily that captures mainstream sentiment (by means of an algorithm quantifying headlines) and mainstream exposure. From this the ratio between positive and negative crypto headlines are calculated and plotted.
Interestingly the latest up and downturns in Bitcoin price are preceded by a drop and rise in sentiment. Future will tell if this will persist in the future, but it gives some insight in how sentiment affects price.
Anyway, for those interested in keeping track of sentiment the graph is updated daily at [

Not sure what you are implying?

Correlation (in this case) is an irrelevant metric. Correlation (pearson) gives some indication of linear co-movement of two variables. Financial markets are generally very complex, and if there are any related indicators they are generally not linear... Moreover you want something that starts oscillating before that what you are interested in (in this case price), rather than at the same time. Therefore judging whether an indicator has value is in my opinion it is more appropriate to set up some long short portfolio based on the indicator value (sort of a Fama Macbeth regression). However I havent got around to setting this up yet.

For the past year I've been scraping financial news headlines in for the use of sentiment analysis on equities. This has resulted in a dataset of about 150k headlines from financial news websites, blogs and forums.
Over time I have shared some analysis of this data ([
I have now added an additional graph showing relative polarity (positive news vs negative news) over time. This gives some interesting additional info in my opinion.
Anyway feel free to share your opinion, if you find it interesting it is updated daily on:

Yes indeed, that is on the list to include next. Probably the time horizon is too short to establish causality (does news drive price or does price drive news?) but ill keep updating the data to get more info over time. Anyway, thanks for the suggestion and ill add a price overlay somewhere in the near term.

The reason for this is a bit more nuanced. The algorithm calculating polarity looks for words that signal either positive or negative sentiment. However there are more words with a negative connotation than with a positive connotation and therefore the absolute number has a bias towards a negative number. Therefore the change in value is (in my opinion) more meaningful than the actual value itself

I’ll add in a next update of the code

A couple of days a ago I shared a graph showing crypto exposure on mainstream news ( ). A common request was to have BTC movement as overlay, which is added now.  
Anyway, graph is still available and updated daily on

Since, arguably, the rise and fall of crypto prices is related to the exposure and awareness by the general public, I found it interesting to see how much Bitcoin/Crypto is mentioned on general news outlets over time. Moreover an algorithm (based on a Loughran-Mcdonald dictionairy) allows it to classify headlines as positive, negative or neutral. 
Anyhow, I setup an algorithm as to run and update this every day and because there was a lot of positive response I decided to share the daily output. It is available as standalone graph at  The graph is designed with plotly so it is customizable and data points are openly available. If there is any interest in it Ill keep it publicly available, if not it is going to the private collection;)

No they are on a private Synology, since the database is quitte large it is more efficient to only push the analysis online. If I get around to it im planning on adding a drilldown function to show the actual headlines in the graph.
