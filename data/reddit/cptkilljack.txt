Never had a problem with Wells Fargo and Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:01:20
Bcash is green because no one uses it lol.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:17:29
I too am not getting paid my .01+BTC. Oh well time to mine something else. I think Im going to point my GPUs at ETH for a while to diversify my portfolio a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:23:32
Wells Fargo has yet to complain about my dealings with Coinbase but Im also not using Credit to do my business with them.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:03:49
Wait I thought we already hit the moon. TOO MARS!!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:01:56
If I had won the lottery. Id probably invest in more bitcoin. After funding the USS Texas' Drydock.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:52:27
Just wondering when you passed the .01 threshold. Once past that point if you mine to an External wallet it would payout on every Friday.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:28:41
I dont know what everyone is worried about. All I see is an Internet Money Sale. IMS for short.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:08:57
To be honest Im not deterred by the fees on coinbase. Its the cost of convenience of not having money on an exchange but still being able to buy right way. If I bought $50 worth right now it could cost me $2 and thats not bad. I went thou and figured out where the fee increases and you can order $51.99 of Bitcoin and Get $50 after fees at $2. At $52 it increases fees to $3.

Yes but the bank executives and the media reporting on bitcoin did the opposite of what they wanted. Instead of getting those of us that hold bitcoin out it inevitably made more people watch it and probably get some bitcoin. Im personally going to invest heavy if it drops by 75% and whatever I put in high be damned buy more. Im looking at an investments as With China Petro Yuan coming out the Dollar is probably going to loose its reserve status and I want to be in something else that holds good value compared to the rest of the world before that happens.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:42:14
Im prepared to buy when the crash happens.
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:29:54
This is why im only putting in a small portion of my paychecks into bitcoin. As well as mining for Nicehash.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:41:20
I think I may have already. Those 50 Bitcoin from back in 2010 and the .06 I shouldnt have sold In a early dip this year. I learned the lesson and no longer look at bitcoin in a value of dollars but Dollars in value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:49:41
I would totally put that on my wall. My Dad hates bitcoin. He vehemently refuses to let me talk to him about it.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:33:35
I just havent put any in yet. I set up GDAX not long ago but havent moved anything into it yet. I have didnt buy any bitcoin with my last paycheck and this coming paycheck because Im buying a Ledger Blue. And thats where Im going to long term store it. Meanwhile Im mining on Nicehash for more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:29:15
Indeed. And its payday on Friday. So that's a bingo.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:00:38
I intend to Hodl, Buy on Dip and Buy on paycheck and of course mine to my ability.
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:49:16
Here I am and still not changing my mind of the choice of getting a ledger blue for my coin and use Coinbase and gdax to purchase because of the Segwit2x. But I still want the Ledger. I dont have even .1BTC but I dont want to leave it with an Exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:51:51
This is why Ill just settle for a fully decked out Ford Raptor and maybe a Tesla Model 3 or X.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:36:09
Hes one of those that only sees it as the tool in what it was used for back in 2010 and 2011. Basically for drugs. Its not money and he doesnt want to hear about it. Meanwhile I continue to mine with Nicehash to get more. I of course never used it for those purposes. But he would always send me emails with articles about how bitcoin was being used for the wrong things. And thats the mentality he has about it.
I really want to send him the page for the NPR interview on bitcoin that went up today as it actually has some good info for those that have a view on bitcoin from when all you heard were the bad things people were doing with it.

My last time dealing with the fraud department helped me hurt my back for 4 months because they couldnt file that I was out of state and to allow purchases from outside the state at a convention. I called 10 times before it was fixed when I was at a vendors booth trying to purchase something..
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:55:30
My only problem is we cant go to the site and order just one of the units. We must order 5 along with the power supplies. I dont want a tone. I would just put one in my Garage and have it run. Im rather sad by this. And I would love to buy one of these.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:27:23
Hey If difficulty magically went down I would be happy to return to GPU mining. I can think of a lot of people who would do that.
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:29:27
Just wondering if anyone else here has ever read the book "Ready Player One"?
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:46:30
Why shouldnt you have dont that. You have 1BTC now. I wish I had the buying power to get a whole btc right away. Although Im looking at what bitcoin will be 5 years from now as many things happen to the validity of bitcoin which will increase its worth.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:57:23
I would be buying.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:29:16
That's exactly the mentality I have gained over the last 2 months I wish I had 7 years ago when I was an unemployed college student with 50 Bitcoin. But the lesson is learned and for the future we buy. And if the crash for told by history happens I'll be ready to buy a lot. But until then I'll be buying what I can afford with each paycheck.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:38:27
it is quite true. Iv learned my lesson. I want to see how far it drops. I would love to buy more if it drops thousands. Then again most of us that HODL will buy more at that. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:24:57
I sold them for $10 each. They sustained me.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:38:23
GPU mining can always return. I was actually looking at it this morning. Im after BTC to if it would be better to mine direct I will move 3 GPUs over to direct mining and possibly instruct my friends that are mining to do so. I just dont know what miners are out there today. I havent GPU mined for bitcoin directly since 2011 when my friends developed the Phoenix miner.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:28:58
Its 3M Novic Fluid. Its completely inert and boils at ~34 Degrees. Its meant to be evaporative cooling and then hits some condenser coils above which arent shown to make the gas back into a liquid so it doesnt run out. But it heats up the liquid and the heat is carried away with the bubbles. It was designed for Data Centers.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:01:55
I would rather get a decked out Model 3 for around 55-60K.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:19:12
However you cant just pay $1350+115. You must multiply that by 5 which is the minimum order. As someone who would buy one I dont need 5 of them.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:38:20
Hey I didnt say I wasnt buying in the mean time. Any amount of BTC is good BTC regardless of the price.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:03:25
I vote for this one. Its perfect.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:11:17
Right there with you bud. Just waiting on the weak minded to relinquish their shares.
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:43:06
cant tell if good or bad comment...
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:09:57
As well as a lot of pools provided a wallet as well.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:51:35
I like them and Might actually get one but I have the problem of they wont let me get 1. I must Buy 5 and also buy the power supplies for them.
@_date: 2018-03-02 03:22:03
I would say that it has something to do with the picture frame.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:14:06
Had no money to buy the dip with because of car repairs. But I do have a working car.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:30:54
Thank you. That did it.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:10:56
Ill look into it when i get off work. The app looks interesting.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:48:15
I should do this next summer.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:25:27
How about The Bitwizard or Bit the Wizard of Coin.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:49:46
I need to find this later when reception is better on phone.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:13:41
I saw you were in Denver and wished I had gone out that day. Would have been great to have helped you out or cheered you on. I'm working on getting some of my co-workers to invest.
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:57:54
Oh it didnt pay for college. Bitcoin was worth $10 It helped me buy what I needed.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:27:19
I would gladly purchase one Bitcoin If I had the capability to. But small purchases each paycheck will have to do.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:40:24
This is a great app. But since I got more ETH it hasnt updated the amount of ETH I have.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:22:17
I can say that I did not fully understand it back in 2011 as a college student. If I had I wouldn't have sold 50 BTC for $10 be each back then. And even this year with the beginning of BTC boom from ETH I sold when it started plummeting I sold .04 BTC. And then my eyes were opened as it rose to 5000 and I now understand the investment and holding for the long haul. I will also be investing a small bit of my paychecks each time into Bitcoin. It's for the future although I can't convince my parents as such.  
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:16:10
Im kind of hoping this dip keeps going till after payday.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:52:41
I would be down for that.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:20:32
I'm considering it myself because I don't know where to trust to keep my coin at the moment. I'm using Coinbase ATM.
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:26:02
I do regret not getting back into bitcoin as well as selling off my 50 bitcoin year and years ago. Although it funded me as a college student and I probably would still have it if I were to have gotten a job.
