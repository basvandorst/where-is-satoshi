my experiences have been that it takes around 40-60 minutes to transfer out bitcoin, iirc.  If you are just looking to get fiat in and crypto out to somewhere else to do trading, I find that litecoin is the faster way to do so.

Sure - and trezor looks like a knock off tamagotchi..  but they both are pretty handy!

1) exchange like coinbase, kraken, bittrex, bitstamp etc, you can sell for USD and then transfer to bank
2) localbitcoins.com
3) a card like shift or bitpay

Any specific reason why you went trezor vs ledger?

For hardware, Trezor and Ledger.  Store any sensitive information in a safe or bank deposit box.  In the case of a hardware wallet, I'd advise storing in separate locations so one can't be known without the other, if possible.  Just a matter of how paranoid you want to be and what is worth the cost of creating a level of security that makes sense and how often youre going to access your funds.  Also don't forget where you put them.

I am still trying to get a handle on the multiple accounts, wrench attack mitigation, etc.  I do wish I could install more than just 4 coins though...

localbitcoins.com ? But my guess at that buy amount, you're going to have to deal with the person to person fuckery and the added cost of dealing directly vs dealing with exchange.  As for getting in touch with a miner, I have no idea, but I would start getting in touch with local crypto meetup groups and see if anyone has extra out there.

Check out under your Tools -&gt; History -&gt; and then click on the transaction in question for Buy Details... It might have some more information about your buy order.

Cool - i just got my ledger after waiting for weeks, was wondering if there was something other reason besides available for one v. the other

Not going to lie, I was really hoping for an animation of all the coins logos dancing on a dance floor with a cameo from charlie lee and vitalik ...
