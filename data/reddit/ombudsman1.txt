Could you elaborate what you mean with 'acceptable until the end of July'? I thought these companies like bitmain only would support Segwit with a 2x fork tied to it.

No, Chainlink (LINK) is.

 Don't click this link. Trojan behind it.

I don't think a lot of people are buying before we know if BIP91 locks in (earliest July 23th) 
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:18:36
I'll do that. 
You're not my financial advisor, but since you mentioned the hard-fork associated with BIP91, maybe you could give me your thoughts;
with the hf coming, would it actually be a good long term investment to buy BTC when BIP91 locks in? Or do you think it's better to buy, sell at a peak in the summer, and re-evaluate after the hf?

Could you tell me why this site shows the last 144 blocks, and not the last 336 blocks, which is the number of blocks looked at for the 80% threshold?

I don't understand. I'm not really into this subject, buy wasn't signaling for BIP91 supposed to start at July 21th?

Oh yeah, I think after bip91 lock-in, there's a very big chance the price will rise a lot. What sources do you use to determine probability of a lock-in before it actually happens?

 Could someone explain me why signaling for BIP91 / Segwit2x starts today, and not July 21th?

Alright. I was referring to BIP91. Signaling starts July 21th, and Segwit locks in automatically as soon as 80% of the hash power signals support for BIP91 within a pre-defined series of 336 blocks, right? 
Is there any way I can check BIP91 support real-time? 
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:00:47
63,3% doesn't look too good for BIP91. Do you expect some of the 'no' pools to still switch to 'yes'?
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:22:30
ViaBTC mentions NYA in their blocks as well. Same goes for them?

Turned out to just be an option to switch to another public address for BTC, if you would want that for privacy reasons.

You don't think it's save to assume the price of BTC will decrease further towards the end of the month? You don't have to time the minimum price well to make it profitable, just have to be fairly sure the price will fall, no matter how little. If I were a hodler, I would for sure sell a big part of my BTC at $2500, and buy back with all that money later this month. No brainer imo. The more worried you are that the price won't drop towards segwit, the smaller part of your BTC you should sell and buy back. What am I missing?
