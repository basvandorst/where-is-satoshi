wao...that a great new....actually in china people prefer to use digital money to pay...and the market it's estimated around 9 trillions...so imagine a 40% of that amount in bitcoin or other crypto...

well..maybe i didn't expresss myself very good...we can consider state-run crypto as semidecentralized...semidecentralized because even if they are emitted by a state they are still based on a decentralized technology built on peer to peer technology and they can give to that state a kind of freedom from other state currencies....about bitcoin...yes it's decentralized but the fact that the 51% of hash power it's in the hands of few big company it's a very big problem...me too at the beginning i thought that even if that 51% was destroyed there was the other 49% that can sobstitute that gap but it's a bigger mess than you think and there are two reasons why i'm telling this.
First: even if you destroy that 51%...in the other 49% there will be always bigger companies or group of people that together will have the majority of hash power obtaining decisional power on transactions and blocks validation.
Second: if the 51% of hash power fall all together in a very short period of time...this will lead to a big drop in the bitcoin price (and i mean very big) pushing people to sell their bitcoin( panic sell) for stablecoin or fiat currency leading to a very severe bitcoin crash.
i made a lot of research from a lot of time...and the only stable consent mechanism from my point of view will be the Pure proof of stake (not proof of work).
Take in considerations that this is only my personal point of view and i don't want to force anyone to share it.
Maybe i'm wrong or maybe i'm right... who knows.

but the tech behind him it's decentralized...they used it to be free from USA control...imagine each country in the world with their official cryptocurrency....they could become indipendent from each other...and for "the same it's happening"...i intended that as africa used bitcoin to be free from FRance control the same it's doing venezuela with pedro against the USA even if the pedro it's a governement run but not fully decentralized as bitcoin ( but we can say the same for bitcoin because as you know the 51% of mining computational power is in the hands of three big bitcoin farms making the system not really decentralized and giving them a big power on transactions and block validations)

yeah....in africa bitcoin had a great success... the main reason is in the fact that france control the money emission rate in a lot of african countries don't giving them the freedom to do it by themeselves....so they used bitcoin that it cannot be controlled by any governements and banks....the same it's happening in Venezuela with Pedro....

well....bitcoin it's a decentralized payment system based on peer to peer technology...nobody can't stop you to send any kind of money amount around the world...you can send 1000000 dollars from the north pole to the south pole in 15/20 mins  without giving explanation to nobody....in any case it's not an anonymous payment system as it was intended to be.

be the owner of the 51% of the hash power means to be the owner of the entire blockchain having the power to manipulate the prices, blocks validations and transactions... thus transforming the blockchain from a decentralized platform to a completely centralized platform... this cannot happen with the Pure proof of stake model based on byzantine agrrement...give a check to that consent mechanism and you will understand what i mean
