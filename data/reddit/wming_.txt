My trezor has always been PIN protected; it wasn't PASSPHRASE protected (for that matters). And again, it is impossible that anyone had physical access to my device, expecially when the hack happened since at the time I was alone at the computer, in my room, where the Trezor was.
I would have no reason whatsoever to make this whole story up.
I know you are trying to help somehow and I appreciate any insight but facts are facts. You don't have to believe me, I get it. It is what it is.

There is absolutely no way that someone someone did it physically using my hardware, that I can exclude 100%; about the Trezor being compromised, I purchased it brand new on the official website and I don't see how it would be possible.
I think there MUST be a third option. It just, again, makes no sense.

I didn't protect it with a passphrase, this is my bad I guess; but still, no one but me could ever touch my trezor, let alone know the PIN or seed. As is, I doubt the passphrase would have made a difference. But maybe it would have.

I thought it had to be related because the timing was there. It was the only explenation I could come up with, I quite honestly couldn't think of anything else at the time because it's the only alternative to "someone I care found a way to steal my seed". And again, the timing. Although I'm now less convinced (because of how strongly the community reject the idea that there might be a vulnerability in Trezor) I still think this has to be the case, it still looks to me way more likely than the alternative. I understand it sounds extremely biased and frankly it obviously is.
I did never enter my seed anywhere. This kind of things I can be 100% sure of.

I purchased my Trezor on the official site and I never used it onto a different computer than mine; it never actually left my home since I bought it.
How it happened is a mystery for me as well. It did. I would love to know how and I would have no reason to lie about it.

wrong, my trezor was PIN-protected, I said I didn't use the passphrase protection which is very different.

I live in a house with my parents since July 2017; before that I lived in an apartment in a different country with three close friends. They might have had access to my trezor at the time, but not to my seed. This is just for the record by the way, as I know no one of them would be able to do anything like that... not even if they could, and they most certainly can't because of lack of skills.
Only my mother and father could have access to my room as of now (and they don't know how to turn on a PC). Trezor was up to date.

I didn't have the lucidity to think about it until now, I was too shocked... my ETH, all gone. From 4 different addresses protected by the same Trezor, 35ETH are gone.
It makes a grandtotal of ~55k USD:
All sent to this address:
By following where the money goes, this is the last wallet i get into:

I'm aware I'm the one to blame, I'm not putting it on anyone else. BUT. There's nothing I left out. This is exactly what happened and I'm not seeing how they managed to breach my Trezor either; despite that, they somehow did.

can you please link me that 4BTC post?
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:40:52
Yes, I did generate my own seed, wrote it on paper and stored it safely in a lockbox, where it's always been.
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:35:28
yes, it is
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:57:56
And then I left the chat.
I never leave it plugged. I cannot say it with 100% certainty it was unplugged because I don't remember looking at it... but it's very, very, very unlikely.

from the official website.
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:51:42
Of course, I did follow the Trezor procedure and wrote down the seed.
Then again, what is even harder to understand is: assuming we can agree on the fact that the booking thing and the crypto scam are correlated (of course I cannot be 100% sure, but judging by the timing I'd call it a safe bet), why would anyone with access to my trezor and/or seed need to do that?
I can't help but thinking there's something else to think about.
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:39:41
I did not. The seed is written on paper only and it never left a lockbox in my room since day1.
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:51:37
Look, I see where you are coming from. Not only that, but not even all my bitcoins were stolen: I had more on the very same address. I know this is fucked up and I totally expected to be insulted. All that matters to me now is trying to understand what happened
