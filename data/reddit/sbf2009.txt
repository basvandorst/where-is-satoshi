Because bitcoin isn't actually money?

1) It's not investing, it's gambling. Might as well be buying penny stock.
2) Buy the dip and sell off at the earliest signs of a bubble (~10-20% gain.)
3) Withdraw your principal wager as soon as you can. Only play with profits. This is a game, not a real investment.

You mean like Bitcoin?

Nothing worse than when a currency is devalued to about half overnight.

Why? Anyone could see it was a bubble. I bought at 12500 and sold at 18000 because I know bitcoin is a silly fad. I'm spreading my $200 profit over a bunch of coins to wait for the next meaningless bubble to sell on top of.

The bubble will unpop, any day now...
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:17:55
When you have made your target percent increase and people are still inflating bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:24:13
There's no doubt it's a bubble, but it's easy to make a little bit of money on a bubble when you sell early.

That's a contradiction. All crypto is gambling. You diversify by keeping crypto a very small part of your portfolio and putting most of your real money into proven vehicles: index funds. I put a couple hundred in BTC+ETH+LTC because it's got marginally better odds than the lottery of paying off. Real speculative money I put into high dividend and real estate indices.

Can you repeat that again in English?
@_date: 2018-09-07 13:38:03
This is by far the stupidest thing I've ever read on this subreddit.

Bitcoin is for fun, not for retirement.

Bitcoins are an extremely profitable speculator tool that are otherwise relatively useless. Basically, they're tulips. If you time an investment well, you can try to make money, but no sane human can look at this and not see a massive bubble.

They are exactly the same, though. They are all inherently valueless poker chips. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:29:04
It's like a poker chip.
@_date: 2011-08-15 19:32:53
Why are all the prices in dollars?
@_date: 2011-07-11 18:08:10
You are deluded in the idea that somehow bitcoins will magically make all the normal barriers to entry in a business different that if he were using real money.
@_date: 2011-07-20 05:23:34
Cause people buy them.

I tried like hell to set up bitcoin on ubuntu. Linux's usual unnecessary difficulty combined with a lack of good bitcoin software made it too difficult for me to even want to get it working. I would like a user friendly bitcoin client with a good UI and easy setup.

@_date: 2011-06-28 03:07:13
Cause aint no good alternatives that people know about.

The catch is he'll pay the bet in bitcoins, win win.

Is it secure to keep a server in America, what if they legislate against it?
@_date: 2011-10-08 01:53:25
I remember when the bitcoin was $30...
@_date: 2017-05-08 02:39:53
That exactly proves my point. Deflation destroys the point of currency.
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:38:55
This just encourages people to not treat bitcoin like a currency. It's just a commodity for speculation now.
@_date: 2011-06-23 01:24:12
PLEAAASE! I've been waiting forever to get into day trading with USD, and I don't know where to go.
@_date: 2018-04-05 11:56:12
Where's my $10 in bitcoin that I bought in 2013?
@_date: 2011-09-08 00:37:21
Is it bad that all I noticed was his huge gut?
