Um, you may be a few fries short of a Happy Meal....because we want to service customers from Texas! Welcome to Gemini Texans ;-)
@_date: 2016-04-10 03:53:52
You would never make the word "Asset" plural in this context -- for example, you wouldn't ever see "Bitcoins Exchange". 
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:39:59
Will definitely consider adding it to the exchange pages as well! Thx for your feedback -- as you can see we listen to our customers and try and deliver ASAP!
@_date: 2016-04-09 21:23:19
Cameron -- President of Gemini here -- Yes we do! Very excited about the new paint job on the Gemini spaceship ;-)
@_date: 2016-04-10 18:11:56
Thank you!!!
@_date: 2016-04-09 22:41:23
Damn straight.
@_date: 2016-04-20 17:39:42
Welcome ;-)
@_date: 2016-04-09 21:37:15
We are indeed responsive! We are even using special layouts for different sizes of tablets. Wait, hold on a sec...2001 called and just asked me to ask you for their Motorola Startac back. 
@_date: 2016-04-09 21:40:35
Hi Frapp -- so we built our exchange for both ***individual*** and ***institutional*** traders -- you will see that not only in how we built our entire GUI and infrastructure, but also our entire site messaging which speaks to this very mission. All market participants are welcome and important to Gemini!
@_date: 2016-04-09 22:38:13
Absolutely -- we released new order types ***maker-or-cancel*** and ***immediately-or-cancel*** on Thursday (though currently only available via API). You can read more about them [here](
We will continue to evaluate more order types and trading functionality based on customer feedback. 
@_date: 2016-04-09 22:41:56
I could tell you...or you can go and look around and see for urself! Working on it.
@_date: 2016-04-09 22:40:46
Until next time! Just make sure you get more out of what you are being served on the next literal round (i.e. drinking) than it takes out of you ;-)
@_date: 2016-04-09 21:41:27
Great suggestion! Appreciate the feedback ;-)
@_date: 2014-10-31 14:38:21
Just released Android!
@_date: 2014-10-31 14:34:54
You all asked for it, and now we are happy to deliver our first Android app! This continues our efforts to bring the most accurate price of bitcoin to as many users as possible. As always, your feedback is invaluable (in fact, many suggestions have already made it into our pipeline) and we welcome your comments as we continue to improve WinkDex.

Hi everyone.  We built a new BTC-USD calculator that uses Winkdex’s blended bitcoin price to determine historical pricing of US dollars and bitcoins on a specified date.  The calculator will display the Winkdex value of said amount in the corresponding denomination as of 4:00PM Eastern on the date identified.  
I hope this is a helpful tool for the community.  I welcome any and all feedback, but please also bear w/ us as this is a first version ;-)
@_date: 2014-09-25 00:01:10
It will should appeal to "technologically challenged folks" as well investors and investment funds (hedge funds, pension funds, etc.) who are unable to hold the bitcoin asset outright based on their subscription agreements, but can buy/sell equities. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:30:30
Thx, I have actually already checked out Safecoin. On first pass it looked like some details were underspecified, however, I plan to keep tabs and review again as they make progress. The idea they are trying to solve is certainly "big". 
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:02:42
I welcome any feedback or further input.
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:18:46

@_date: 2014-10-15 14:37:18

Correct. SEC rules prohibit me from discussing specifics of our S-1 filing while under review.

My brother Tyler and I recently gave this presentation on money (@ Money20/20). Our premise is that money today is creating a trade problem (broken), but crypto-currencies can and will solve this problem, enabling entirely new and previously unthinkable forms of trade in the future. Hope you enjoy!

Nope -- we just opened our services to customers in the UK.

@_date: 2015-08-13 21:25:49
Hey guys, Cameron here. Just wanted to clarify that the emails sent out today were sent to institutional customers (who signed up to our early access list) in order to begin the process of setting up their account -- there’s more KYC work to do to get institutions onboarded than individual customers, hence why we have started to get the process started with these folks earlier. We’ll be sending out invites to individuals once we’re ready to launch, which we expect to be quite soon.
@_date: 2015-08-14 15:00:41
We've been doing some internal testing on exhange.gemini.com to make sure it's all ready to go live, that's why you're seeing market data.
We're using decimal representations everywhere internally, no floats at all. 
We’ve also been testing out different numerical precision settings on our exchange, which is why you’re seeing some really ultra-precise numbers in the market data feed.  We’ve since moved that activity to our internal test servers, and we’ll be turning down our exchange's precision settings before we open to the public.
While we work on a set of v2 APIs of our own design, we've made our v1 API so that it's mostly compatible with Bitfinex. That necessitated some ugly looking JSON, but I assure you our internal data is much cleaner.

Gemini's Chief Security Officer, Cem Paya, found a key-extraction vulnerability in Safenet HSMs. If you have been using Safenet HSMs for managing Bitcoin keys, your wallet may be at risk. It was reported to Safenet on January 30, 2015, confirmed by vendor on February 11, 2015 and a patch was released yesterday (July 9th).

Neither can we -- hope to service you as a customer very soon!
@_date: 2016-02-16 18:59:04
Working on it! 
@_date: 2016-02-16 18:58:57
Yes -- you can definitely still use micro deposits to link your bank account as an alternative to our new instant option.

@_date: 2016-02-24 23:54:17
Yes that's the official blog post we published earlier today outlining Gemini's Fee Schedule. 
@_date: 2016-02-22 20:49:25
We are a fiduciary and allowed to service both individual and institutional customers -- as a fiduciary, we must meet the highest levels of banking compliance, regulatory and capitalization requirements and we have an obligation to protect the interests of our customers first and foremost. So ask yourself, would you rather trade on a platform that has the consumer protections mentioned above, or trade on an unlicensed unregulated platform that may or may not take the same precautions when it comes to the protection of their customers?
@_date: 2016-02-22 16:20:37

@_date: 2016-02-24 15:16:21
An area = a state, country or any legal jurisdiction in which we are operational. We link to all of our areas of operation in the post, so not sure what your actual question/point is...but thanks for your support past and present! 
@_date: 2016-02-02 18:59:19
Eric (our VP of Engineering) wrote a great post here -- if anyone has any further questions about our multi-user or Gemini in general feel free to ask me (Cameron). 
@_date: 2016-02-22 18:51:50
One of the most obvious differences is that we are licensed, they are not.

Cameron (President of Gemini) here -- would love to hear questions / feedback anyone has! 
@_date: 2016-02-02 20:20:13
The average trader may not, but programmatic institutional traders definitely do/will. Latency and reducing jitter is key to allowing traders to model what to expect with respect to orders getting filled on an exchange.

And yes, STEP 1 is to read the blog -- a two-sided end-of-day auction is a basic mechanism (*universal in the world of finance*), and yet almost all of the questions here are from people who *clearly* didn't read the blog...**SMH**

That's right -- Gemini Trust Company, LLC, a New York state limited liability trust company, which makes us a **fiduciary**, and allows us to accept both **individual** and **institutional** customers under *New York Banking Law* (unlike the BitLicense, which does not convey such fiduciary powers).
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:32:32
Absolutely -- we are looking at expanding our area of operation globally and will announce accordingly on our blog as things develop.

Thx for the support, but we have it under control -- will keep you posted and updated as things unfold. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:30:09
Spartans hold! This isn't a month to month thing, its going to take years to build the infrastructure necessary to unleash the promise of Bitcoin -- we are in it for the long haul.
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:04:00
why thank you ;-)
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:19:53
Sure -- Institutions can be comfortable that we have the highest level of *capitalization* and *regulatory policies*, and can rely on us acting as a **fiduciary** (i.e., to protect their interests first and foremost). 
@_date: 2015-10-05 15:18:22
Incorrect -- Gemini Trust Company, LLC, is a New York state limited liability trust company, which makes us a **fiduciary**, and allows us to accept both **individual** and **institutional** customers under *New York Banking Law* (unlike the BitLicense, which does not convey such fiduciary powers). Coinbase is currently _unlicensed_ in the State of New York (but applying for a BitLicense -- a much lower licensing standard).

Coinbase and a Gemini comparison is an apples to oranges exercise. Gemini Trust Company, LLC, a New York state limited liability trust company, which makes us a **fiduciary**, and allows us to accept both **individual** and **institutional** customers under New York Banking Law (unlike the BitLicense, which does not convey such fiduciary powers). In other words, Institutions can be comfortable that we have the highest level of _capitalization_ and _regulatory policies_, and can rely on us acting as a **fiduciary** (i.e., to protect their interests first and foremost). Coinbase is applying for a Bitlicense which does not convey such powers.
Wto itBit, we are both going after a *very large* market that is to date completely underserved or not even in Bitcoin at all. I think its a good thing that there are multiple efforts trying to build bitcoin infrastructure (including Coinbase) so that we can get this thing to the moon. No single points of failure, lots of tunnels, bridges and onramps...onward and upward!
