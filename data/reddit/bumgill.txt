Though the invest/understand aspect is true, it doesn't imply that he invests in everything he understands. Not that you really implied that, but just a note for others reading your comment.

It doesn't make much sense to conflate bitcoin with technology, broadly.

No, but they clearly wouldn't be engaging in institutionally supported criminal enterprise for charitable reasons, so it makes sense to assume they turned some profit on it. Whether or not it's more than $1.9B remains unknown.

The domain was seized and the business is shut down. That is significantly more damaging relative to total assets than the HSBC fine.
Since the HSBC fine is so relatively small (compared to their assets and profits) it shouldn't be considered "busted" since it is unlikely to dissuade HSBC from engaging in similar behavior in the future. You're only "busted" if you're caught and stop as a result. There's no reason for HSBC to stop since it makes more financial sense for them to continue then pay the relatively small fine if/when they get caught.

They wouldn't have been doing it, at the time, if it didn't make financial sense. Since they were knowingly laundering money (and knowing it was a crime) over a decade, it seems pretty unlikely that a $1.9B fine somehow made it no longer a good business idea. Of course, future indications of similar wrongdoing would result in a greater fine. There are unknowns involved, but you can make reasonable assumptions (which is all anyone can do without extensive access to secret financial records).
EDIT: This is especially true since the risk for laundering money for drug smuggling and terrorist organizations is so potentially high and their assets are about $2.6T. They'd charge a hefty fee for such a service, and those people need a lot of money cleaned.

Well, [they aren't entirely alone](

They hardly suffered punitive punishment. I'm not sure an effectively nominal fine which ensures the laundering is cost effective (and encourages it in the future) constitutes "busted." If those assets had been seized or a larger fine levied or the company shuttered, then I'd agree.

I'm sure MetArt considers itself erotica instead of pornography. Better [show it to Justice Stewart](
