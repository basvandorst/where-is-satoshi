The difference between this community and the rest of humanity is that this community is using energy at an unthinkably incomparable pace
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:16:57
A simple extrapolation of the current trends leads to this logical conclusion.
I asked what I'm missing, and only a couple people have filled me in on efforts to curb energy intensity, which I intend to look into. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:16:25
Correct. A life well lived has nothing to do with you - I promise that if you forget about yourself and work to help others (currently alive or yet to be born), you'll have a sense of fulfillment far beyond what you could otherwise achieve.
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:25:41
OK, so even with some sort of self correcting system that adjusts for the supply of mining (that presumably is related to energy costs), it remains energy intensive (and likely considerably moreso than now) unless the global price of energy is made onerously high (which seems impossible)?
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:41:59
Someone else posted that he has created a far more accurate estimate, which shows half the energy. Even it if was 10% the energy, this is horrifying
Yet again, the planet doesnt care about our "economic interests". It's in my (and all of our) existential interest that people start thinking and doing something about this. To say nothing of the fact that a life solely valued by economics is just a shell of human potential...
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:47:40
Really? You can't value something that is literally rooted in valuing stuff? 
And what is economic freedom and how does bitcoin satisfy that?
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:23:26
My entire point is that people don't seem to be taking the real ecological costs into account at all. Almost all rational arguments have been purely economic. But the planet doesnt know or care about our economics... It cares about heat. And from what I've seen and shared, thus uses an ungodly amount of energy - multiple US households worth per transaction. This techno economic circle jerk honestly strikes me as FAR worse and much less controllable than the financial industry... 
I've been given some good links by so I'm gonna go through all those. You might want to as well. 
But again, my understanding right now is that  if you can't untangle energy from price, the only possible outcomes are the world burning as price goes to the moon, or the price catering as we recognize the existential threat
Perhaps there are ideas in the works that will make this more energy efficient, but one thing to consider is if bitcoin is supposed to be sound money, how can they be changing/"improving" the way it works? And who are "they"? And can "they" be manipulated?
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:17:45
Which require energy and are presumably less efficient than whatever they currently use... 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:30:51
OK thanks a lot. 
One last dumb question (I'd prefer you to clarify than some morons I find through Google - they seem to be predominant), what is the scaling phase? Building out the infrastructure to make this sustainable and ubiquitous globally?
Ps. Your silence on the future/manipulability of bitcoin in particular is duly noted... I'm a fan of block chain, but it seems that this will not be the surviving format.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:45:20
I cant imagine that mining gold, or all of the other stuff you've mentioned, has nearly the energy intensity of bitcoin, which uses the power of multiple US households to process a single transaction... If that were extrapolated to the trillions of global transactions, it would be apocalyptic. A few have started to explain how the energy requirements are inherently capped, so that's something for everyone to look into, but this comment doubles down on what I greatly fear is the biggest problem - that people seem to value economics and "sound money" above all else. The earth doesn't care about either of these things though, only heat. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:08:31
Thanks again, very interesting stuff.
Is there somewhere I can go to find more on all of this in a popular (non computer geek) format? The other answers on here would be farcical if not for the serious existential implications.
But let me ask again, doesn't even open source undermine the idea of bitcoin and the lack of tampering? How do you implement changes to something that is supposed to be unchangeable? And doesn't it stand to reason that someone with enough inclination (like those this system is trying subvert) could forceably become the gatekeeper? 
And if you can't change bitcoin itself, doesn't that mean that some new crypto currency needs to be developed, rendering bitcoin worthless? 
 I'm a general fan of the block chain concept, but bitcoin just strikes me as premature and doomed to fail. I'm encouraged by all these alternative heat uses though.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:21:20
So there are plans in place to scale it and make it more energy efficient. I get it (and will certainly look into those things more). But what about the meantime? The energy stats are literally exponentially growing. 


Given the immediate importance of energy usage, this proves my point that bitcoin is a ecological catastrophe, doesn't it? 
And while I appreciate that there are people who are seriously thinking about all this stuff, why should anyone put their trust (which is required, and antithetical to the whole project) in them if they didn't foresee these problems to begin with? 
And again, this isn't a purely academic, rational thing. Putting aside ecological stuff, will all the folks involved maintain their intellectual integrity with a gun at their head? And while they may think they are anonymous, I think the nsa would beg to differ. This is the reality of the world. Having any human input makes this fragile and defeats the principle of soundness. I just don't see how anyone can hold it up as incorruptible while also praising the value of a committee that can change it all.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:37:46
This is MY point. This argues against the need for bitcoin (which isn't ecologically costless) altogether... 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:34:55
That all sounds nice. But how does bitcoin (not block chain) and the seemingly myopic focus here on economics play into that world? Seems like it's the latest and greatest iteration of that dying meme, which is bringing our existence along with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:12:16
Yes, that's where I was mostly going with this. Amorality (at best) and the religion of ME are the dominant themes in our time, and it's literally killing our species prospects of survival. And even if no one cares about future generations (a horrific notion), it's hurting our own lives via forest fires, floods, shitty infrastructure, etc...
However, I'm not so sure about this Ray kurzweil singularly stuff. It seems to be a techno-spin on the same amoral ME theme, and ignores resource scarcity, etc... Living forever wouldnt even be enjoyable anyway. We get value, motivation and fulfillment precisely because of our mortality 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:20:36
If Lloyd "doing God's work" blankfein is interested in something, count me out.
There's a massive difference in understanding economics and understanding the business of economics/finance. With the exception of perhaps woz, none of those people have anyone's interests in mind but their own.
And block chain is probably better than gold. But that doesn't make it good or necessary. Its also all within a very myopic, capitalist, transactional  worldview
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:15:06
I'm all for machines doing all the shit work for us so that we can just sniff flowers and daydream, but as it stands the machines will all be owned by like 10 people.
Even if bitcoin democratize that (I don't see how it could, they'll just have their armies of actual, tangible resources take you/your coins if needed) then we have a new oligarchy of soulless, techno robots who equally value money over all else

@_date: 2017-11-05 04:03:07
If you cared to look closer, or at all, at the link I shared, you'd see how incomparably less efficient bitcoin is than visa alone. And the accuracy doesn't matter because there's endless buffer room available.
And the trend is only getting worse.
So there are two scenarios in my mind. 1) bitcoin becomes ubiquitous and kills us all 2) people realize this and abandon it, making it worthless 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:00:48
A few questions.
1) what's the antiquated part and how does it drop, and what does bitcoin have to do with that? Is it getting rid of bitcoin altogether (thus making it worthless, thus it'll never be adopted)? 
2) this isn't just some academic game. There is a serious ecological impact of this that we really cannot afford to be paying. How is this not immeasurably worse than the ecologically negligible wink and a handshake of current currencies? Again, the financial system and our entire way of living is a disaster, but the currency itself is not an ecological disaster.
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:32:55
The problem is not current usage (though still a problem given how unknown bitcoin is and the marginal utility that it provides). The problem is how much it is growing and will use in the future. Please review the link and data to get an idea of how crazy this is

How does this store any value? Value is in tangible resources, human ingenuity, ecological balance etc... This is literally some electrons that require unthinkable amount of energy to maintain. If scaled to process the transactions of the global financial system, we will all die in days.

Sorry, that was a reference to his assertion after the financial crisis that he's been doing God's work, rather than hollowing out the country. Whether or not there is any God(s) is irrelevant. 
And while anyone is capable of changing, he most certainly hasn't while he remains the ceo of the sneakiest, most pernicious, money driven organization in the world. 
And on closer inspection he's just on the fence about it, which I was as well til I realized it may very well kill us all. Some of what you've shared helps my concerns, but I'm still not sure. And given that very few seem to share these concerns, it stands to reason that very few incorporate this factor into valuing their "investment". Yet another reason it'll collapse when reality strikes. Will it be in time? We shall see.. 
Could you elaborate on fixing double spend?
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:30:02
Thanks, I'll check out your work. But at a glance I find your 5 reasons that it's not wasteful to be DEEPLY unsatisfying. I'll follow up with more detailed thoughts tomorrow on my computer if you like. 
But I specifically said don't pay attention to how accurate the numbers are. Even if it's 4x too high, it's still shocking. Especially since hardly anyone uses bitcoin right now, so it will become a full fledged environmental disaster someday if it continues to grow (which your "investments" rely upon).

@_date: 2017-11-05 14:45:16
Please feel free to elaborate in as much detail as you like on this - this is what this post is hoping to learn. What sort of system would be required to handle trillions of daily transactions? And how far in the future would we have to go to build it?
Also, if it can be capped/changed, how "sound" is this really? I thought the entire point was that no one could manipulate how this works. Anything with a human element, even open source, can be influenced by anyone who cares enough. I can think of a lot of powerful people who might care enough...
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:01:31
For 1 and 2, this doesn't really address the fact that using energy creates heat. So regardless of how it is produced (and I'm skeptical about these sources), more transactions requires more heat
The key will be this stuff regarding block limit and other innovations that reduce energy cost per transaction. 
If the 1mb size is the problem, why not make it 20mb right now? And if the system can be changed, how is this "sound money"? 
Others have said that the fees are decreasing towards zero and mining new blocks will cease at some point anyway. Regardless, you agree that the power will continue to go up anyway... Thus my concern. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:25:03

@_date: 2017-11-05 06:05:20
This is what I was really trying to learn from this post - could you go into more detail about how profitability, price, transaction volume, energy usage etc... all relate?
As for 1) this is my primary concern, which extends far beyond bitcoin - no one seems to have any concern beyond their economic welfare. 2) the low volume is also what proves my point - if this was actually a legitimate thing, the earth would be on fire. I don't know anything about Lightning etc... Yet, and presumably it helps make it more energy efficient, but how can these sorts of things be retrofitted? I get that it's open source, but isn't bitcoin designed to be tamper proof and unchangeable?
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:14:21
The difference with steak is that we need to eat(though I have given up beef for this reason). There's no need for this false trustless trust system that creates vast emissions when handshakes have largely worked forever for free. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:21:21
If I'm not mistaken, the difficulty (thus energy intensity) for processing transactions continues to increase indefinitely, so eventually the transaction fees would be onerous given the energy required.
Or is the increasing difficulty only related to mining new coins, and transaction processing is easy? 
Still, it remains that the mining of new coins could/will be absurdly energy intensive at some point well before all coins are gone, thus never even reaching this terminal period. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:18:41
I don't know anything about it, and only a little about about non-currency uses of block chain. I do like the idea of it though, but no opinion 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:03:13
Fair points about greenhouse effect being the main issue - generating more heat by releasing energy that has been stored in various forms is likely quite negligible compared to the heat/energy naturally generated by the sun. It's not nothing though, and full renewable energy is a very long way away and the vast energy requirements of bitcoin is not helping at all.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:57:58
Again, I'm still, and always, looking to be less wrong. Id love to discover that this is an unfounded fear, so thanks again for being  the continual voice of reason thus far amongst the rabid fanboys.
But if having a strong grasp of software engineering is required to gain a working, let alone thorough, knowledge of how this works, how will this ever possibly become broadly adopted? Especially when it shows all the telltale signs of a full on mania/bubble, AND most people don't really see anything wrong with money as it is. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:37:28
Thank you for the first remotely satisfying answer.
One main issue I see with what you said is Google is a sovereign entity - it can choose how to power itself (though even "green" energy isn't fully "green"). Bitcoin is decentralized by design, so there's nothing stopping people from burning coal in Uzbekistan (which probably happens, and worse) to mine coins.
Proof of space looks interesting, but how does it get implemented for bitcoin? If it can be retrofitted, doesn't that defeat the purpose of no tampering? If it can't, and needs to be used with a new type of coin, doesn't that render bitcoin worthless? 
Unlike the building of the internet, bitcoin is using more energy than Nigeria, and only still in its infancy in terms of widespread public adoption (which, I presume, is the ultimate goal)
Trust the ecosystem sounds like a line out of a Sci fi dystopia novel... Pretty sure big brother or T-1000 said that.
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:07:44
This is essentially my second question... What happens when it's not economical to mine it?
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:00:47
Those who are even more foolhardy so as to keep buying into a bubble and let earlier "investors" cash out. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:40:54
So you agree that bitcoin is worthless then? That if it were to replace our current currencies, it would have to plummet in price?
(please feel free to elaborate on scaling, etc... And it's relation to energy usage. That's what this post was really trying to learn) 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:16:36
I don't know. From what I understand, though has shared some interesting and encouraging ideas, i hope it flops sooner than later as a result of people realizing this is insanity. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:55:35
I'm extremely well versed in economics and financial/investment stuff, and discovered bitcoin and came to a general understanding of it back when it was at $50, but decided to ignore it since there was, and still is, no way to value it. It's pure speculation. 
It just came back on my radar with the energy angle, and I have zero regrets and still no intention to get involved. I wish everyone well, but I think a lot of people are in for a world of hurt when this "ride"  instantly craters someday. 
I will read up on all you've shared though as I'm very encouraged by blockchain in general, and perhaps a future iteration of crypto currency.
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:02:07
This is precisely my point. No one seems to care about the environmental impact of the energy consumption, so long as it is economical...
And again, what happens after all the coins are mined?
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:17:06
News to me... Seems like the US is doubling down on coal. And the developing world is still very much using it.
And even if we are, how fast are we doing it. Fast enough to counteract our existing use AND absorb the unthinkable amount of energy required to process these transactions - which seems to stand at the rate of multiple US households? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:05:03
How? What does this replace? It seems to be a completely new addition 
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:41:37

Long ago.
Have you considered that there is more to life than money? Such as life/survival itself? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:15:03
Putting aside whether this is actually sounding money when it seems like there's a way for some open source committee to change how it works, how is sound money worth any cost? As it stands, it requires the energy of multiple households to process one transaction. If this is extended to trillions of transactions, the energy requirement is absurd. The fact is that the earth can only process a certain amount of heat at a time, and we're already we past it, without the advent of molten "sound money"...
Others have started to explain how the energy requirements have a limit, but this doesn't do that. Perhaps you can elaborate on it for me?
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:44:49
... Because it's energy footprint is exponentially increasing unlike anything I can think of...
Not to mention that it provides questionable utility to the world, especially when you take the environmental costs into account. At least gasoline lets me go faster.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:33:22
Again, I still have to learn more about what is being done to reduce the energy intensity of transaction processing, but if all the world's transactions by all the world's exponentially increasing, immortal people are done via bitcoin, and it continues to require a vast amount of energy per transaction, then we'll be "living" in a sauna 
Gonna have to agree to disagree on the latter philosophical part. I don't have time to go into that.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:10:01
Could you explain each of these things in more detail? I'm having trouble understanding them.
How could it run on exhaust energy? 
How is 300k an artificial limit? This seems key to my understanding, because if it turns to 1 trillion a day, and it continues to use the energy of multiple houses to process each transaction, the only way this can turn out is the world burning or the price catering... 
And what keeps people processing transactions when the reward is zero (either because price fell, or no mining rewards)? 
 
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:18:42

Again, thank you very much. This sort of stuff (I'm sure some is though) should be stickied in the FAQ. Im clearly not the only one who doesn't know much about any of this, but am certainly in the vast minority who actually cares to learn as opposed to cheerleading a sure bubble (not that this is a scam at all, or that block chain won't stay around)

The problem is that I'm not sure most of you understand how the planet works. 
The planet doesnt care about mining economics. It cares about heat. I care about living. So I care about heat. You should too.

And I'm shilling for the human sector, if you must know.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:49:31
Frankly I don't care about people's motivations for bitcoin. I care about staying alive and when it takes the energy of multiple US households to process a single transaction, I am terrified by what happens if this becomes the global currency.
Some have attempted to explain various innovations that deal with the energy intensity, and I need to go through those, but this doesn't address it at all. I hope you'll give the ecological implications a lot more consideration, lest our collective fingers get literally burned. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:59:36
I'm passionate about humanity and my skin is in that game - I'm just trying to get an understanding of the degree to which this is a major existential issue in the making. The info you shared about harnessing the heat for actual productive purposes was helpful, and I look forward to reading it all, but I'm skeptical 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:24:34
I'll take the red pill, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:24:39
This is my whole argument...
How does bitcoin play into this? Or better yet, how isn't it augmenting the broken system? It is doubling down on money, with an unthinkable ecological cost.
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:16:06
Absolutely. But as it stands, if everything were replaced with bitcoin today, the energy requirements would boil the oceans.
I look forward to reading up more on what you've shared - hopefully it gives me a better understanding and hope that this can someday be a viable alternative. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:56:35
This seems a horrifically flawed methodology and I would very much like a study.
But even then, how do you put the cat back in the bag? You can't stop this by design. Best case, everyone just stops using it and the value plummets and people abandon it... 
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:23:30
This logic is terrifyingly self-serving. "others are doing bad things, thus it's ok for me to do bad things". And if you take even a conservative projection of the energy intensity of bitcoin mining, which already uses as much as Nigeria, which has 130mm people, it far outweighs any dredging. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:22:08
This starts to bring into consideration whether the benefits of crypto currency are actually valuable (I'd generally say no), but it seems to me that if it requires the energy usage of Nigeria to process a negligible number of transaction in comparison to the ultimate goal of universal adoption, then something is really flawed.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:05:54
You do realize that gold has other uses than maintaining a non-existent gold standard, don't you?
And that the entire financial industry is not set up to process payments, but to offer investment services. Whether those services are worthwhile or not has nothing to do with the currency used. If bitcoin became the standard, they'd all still exist. AND, as it stands, all the countless transactions would each require the energy of multiple US houses. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:11:17
Ah yes, feelings. The bedrock of discourse. So long. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:05:13
Most wasteful? That seems like a stretch. 
And how does bitcoin change the fact that people are siphoning value from the world through the financial system? If this were the currency, they'd still do it in exchange for investment/financial services... 
And just think of the countless transactions they manage, in comparison to the pittance that is done by bitcoin... Again, some people have started to explain how the energy consumption reaches a limit and is also tied to price, but you haven't touched on thus at all yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:56:38
Please elaborate on this. This is what I came to learn and have been largely disappointed so far.
How do # of transactions, price, # of coins mined, and difficulty/energy relate to one another? How does this not lead to the apocalypse if there were trillions of daily transactions, without some change to the system that thus nullifies the raison d'etre - sound money?

Also, it made "headlines" a couple weeks ago that a full $7mm usd worth of bitcoin was traded in 2 entire weeks there. That's a blip in terms of economic activity.
Consider rejoining the real world someday, friend.

Real, tangible assets or investing in your skills, capabilities and wisdom are a hedge against collapse/shtf.
If there's a Fiat collapse, it's certain that no normal person who you're gonna need to deal with to buy food etc... is gonna want some computer files.
In the meantime, cash and barter already allows you to pay for literally anything without middlemen or ads.

Isn't that "possible" today? The only appreciable thing that will change in 2 years is the price - quite possibly down.
And if something appreciable will change in 2 years, I'll buy it then. The intl reason to buy it now (or before) is possibly getting it cheaper. Again, the price is everything.

I ate a lot of beets yesterday and I just had a completely purple shit. It's the first one I've had in a long time - should I have collected this rarity to store value?

That's what gold is "supposed" to do and he specifically stated this is a replacement for gold
