I did! Thank you so much!
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:08:23
What does ETA mean?
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:23:37
Can you share the link on Chinese exchanges pls?
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:22:33
Sure. I would like to buy some there. I need a translator...
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:03:44
You should definitely buy it now, because the price will rise today 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:25:18
Okay, but 500$ difference per bitcoin is huge

Who now sells is helping traiders to make their money. We have no (bad) news and no problems. China just prolonged the operation of two major exchanges for one more month until end of October and will come up with an announcement the big Chinese exchanges have licenses to further operate from November on. No panic sells! Just HODL it! 
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:24:44
Just buy and HODL. Traiders try to put the price down and then buy back cheaper.
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:52:25
Do you have the links? On BTCC it is for 3218$ now
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:10:08
From November on they will probably operate with a full license.
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:44:42
The price will rise up to the moon, because of less bitcoins produced.

I want to sell at 20k, where to transfer?
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:55:51
Thanks a lot
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:28:06
Probably it was a testing of the wallet with a little money
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:29:32
Nice (predicting?) video
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:06:52
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:09:47
So it's better not to sell now if we have 500$ difference to western exchanges?
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:52:25

@_date: 2017-09-25 14:38:13
Why now?
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:09:48
What does mean ETA50 or ETA 200 in context of bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:30:34
So you haven't said anything by this posting

How much is that?

What are your price expectations at the end of September/October/November/December 2017?
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:45:20
So what to do now?

@_date: 2017-09-16 09:59:31
Sell now? Okay
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:13:43
Which direction are we going with btc?
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:18:10
What will happen if the price will fall up to 2500$, because of China etc.? I could buy in cheaper and not just waiting for a new peak....
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:48:29
I have no money more to invest, that's why my question about selling today and buying in in 2 months again. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:56:07
If we gonna have another dip of 3000$ it does as well ;)
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:06:52
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:31:21
You're the first who fully replied to my question. Bravo!

Panic sellers will regret!

Nobody is interested in it. Either investors nor traders. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:30:00
Wait for 3 years and everybody will use the bitcoin as a digital money. Companies are now introducing this kind of payment into their portfolio. When the mining of bitcoin is over and the market manipulation is forbidden by law, no major price deviations will exist and people will use bitcoins to pay. At this time one bitcoin will cost 1.000.000$ each. You don't have to believe me, but nobody is interested to destroy this currency because it is the revolution of our traditional ways of payment.
