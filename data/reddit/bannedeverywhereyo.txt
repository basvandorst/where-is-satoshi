most retarded statement ever. Most people don't want to responsibility of holding $10,000+ fiat cash on their person. Does it mean the USD isn't ready to go mainstream?
Fiat/Crypto custodians will never go away, that has nothing to do with crypto's readiness to go mainstream.

Not the same thing at all. $1000 of bitcoin a few years ago had the potential to become $100,000+ of a hideable, liquid asset.
jewelry is not worth 100k nor is it liquid. Cars are not hidable nor liquid.
You have a way bigger target on your back if you are known to hold what is now worth $1mil in crypto than if you are known to own some 50k jewelry or car.

the best thing they could do was convince people who don't understand the tech that big blocks don't scale, which will cripple bitcoin's adoption for years to come while a few guys get 50+mil VC funding for their personal project (lightning)

Incorrect, exchanges exit scam all the time. It's not doomsday, it happens literally every single year. It's not a 1 in a billion chance. More like a chance in hundreds that you will lose your life savings in an exit scam if you keep it all on an exchange.

because it's not a threat, it's free speech fucking communistic retard, though r/bitcoin does its fair share of anti-constitutional banning.

the price increase is way more impressive than that fact.

I'v read many bloomberg articles about topics I'm an expert in and the journalist covering it was either wrong or purposefully lying. News websites often lie or are incorrect.

everybody already knows about bitcoin

you're dumb as fuck, there's 1 major exchange that exit scams every year costing noobs 500mil. Educating those noobs is doing the lord's work.

Incorrect, there's 1 major exchange that exit scams every single year, and a bunch of noobs lose their life savings, costing them $500mil+. This happens every single year and this doesn't stop crypto from gaining more and more adoption every year.
If you have large sums of BTC in an exchange, you are a retard, period.
Assuming there's 200 exchanges, and 2 of them exit scam every year, that's 1% chance of exit scamming. So every year, you have 1% chance of losing your life savings. Yes, you are a retard. It takes maybe 10 hours of learning to buy a hardware wallet and learn how to use it.

People don't understand how electricity works, how how the internet works, how phones work, how medicine works, nobody except specialists know how anything works, it's an extremely low IQ argument.

not really, plenty of open source software are capitalist and make money.
@_date: 2019-10-18 09:47:08
the argument does resolve around price. If you invest in the best technology ever and it goes to -10x and dies, you're an idiot. the best technology certainly doesn't always win.

Bitcoin is worth $8000 today so you're massively in the green, you've beaten pretty much every other market. Tell them that.

Not true at all. Miners (hashpower) help the network. Miners have full nodes. Whether there's 10 miners and 1 million other full nodes or 10 miners and 0 other full nodes has no impact on the network. The exact same transactions and blocks get written and propagated, which the exact same amount of security.
The more decentralized hashpower there is helps the network. Non mining nodes do nothing. A single person could run 1 million non mining nodes with a botnet for almost no money and it would have no positive or negative impact at all.
@_date: 2019-12-23 16:56:40
correct, non mining nodes simply receive and pass around messages. Messages that would reach mining nodes with or without them. They have no power to modify or write messages to the blockchain. The amount of nodes can easily be faked by  a botnet, It has literally no impact on the network. People who run nodes thinking they are "helpful" are retards.
People who think that being able to run a non-mining full node on a laptop has ANY effect on decentralization are even bigger retards.
