1st Don't buy preorder most if not all delay shipment. That will cost you money.
2nd Research BFL on the forums or even Reddit. just in case you don't want to I'll sum up their HW never perform as advertised, they have a terrible costumer support, and for what I have heard from other miners they brake of burn out electronics commonly.
Now as far as mining goes prepare your strategy use calculatorS to make sure if is even possible to ROI read about difficulty increase. I read a lot before I invested mid last year just this month I ROI on my hardware due to a lot of bulk purchases, forum deals and ebay sales, if was only mining I would still be half way to ROI!

For people that don't travel abroad or have to convert currencies Bitcoin is cool. But as soon as you are traveling and having to deal with different currencies and wages earned outside the country of residence BTC is the best solution for all your problems.

Keep in mind that there are several tax exemptions and discounts on capital gains, bonuses, very high incomes as well as outright tax fraud. Most of these tax code exemptions were carved due to wealth and connection influence, if the taxes were equal across the board maybe we all would pay less and still benefit of all the goods ans services above.
P.S. I'm an immigrant (recently naturalized) coming from a outrageously corrupt country, and thanks to our tax dollars, the efforts of my family and many kind strangers. My sister and I were able to attend a public school (far better than any private schools in my country) attended a great university and soon will be graduating with degrees in accounting and engineering respectively. Thank you for your taxes and I hope my past and future contributions can help many others like my family and I.

You don't have to tip the guy, just tweet or leave a supportive message on his channel. The point is not only mine, although that doss help the network, the point is popularize BTC and cultivate adoption giving us freedom from the corruption and greed of banks. If some one that has a large following is excited about it, is bound to get more people interested.

A blog with the experience and some videos would be awesome. I'd definitely contribute some BTC for this project.

Not defending taxes too much, I wish the system was more efficient and we hat to pay less taxes but these taxes fund some greater goods that benefit us all. We have roads, airports, ports, schools, defense (domestic and international) to maintain. Our poor, elderly and sick don't die on the streets (mostly). We have veterans, national parks and other wonders to preserve for posterity.

If it is backed by gold something or someone has to hold on to the gold, so how can it be decentralized?

This guy might have a defense there.

Surprising that a country that took its citizens money would be against an asset they can't seize!

OK, now I understand your point. I believe a better way to refer to that idea would be public or decentralized ledger system as the currency is no longer decentralized it would be stored in a single or multiple buildings. However such currency would forever be subject to currency deflation since any amount of gold added to the reserve would make the currency in circulation a little less valuable than before, in the same manner this currency could suffer of inflation or even become worthless if anything were to happen to the gold reserve.

I do agree we could be more friendly to noobs after all we all want BTC to succeed and that means evangelize. So that others don't think silk road as soon as they hear BTC.

Just because Google owns twitch it does not mean they are a single entity. YouTube is owned by Google yet operations are kept separate as a subsidiary which Google owns all or great majority of stocks.
