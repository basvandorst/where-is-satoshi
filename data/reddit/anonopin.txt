And it looks as if that didn't do him a whole lot of good now, right?

Not enough people are aware of this super simple concept.
Coinbase is no better than PayPal.

The capacity isn't what holds it back, the technology and infrastructure is not there for India.

The darknets are solid, but I don't think they are going to see significant enough gains to affect BTC much at this point. Especially with pot prohibition ending. They were a great launchpad, but some DNMs are pushing Monero, and I don't think the growth of the markets themselves is there.

Yeah, and egifter/gyft/others are nothing new. What a shitty write up, waste of space.

I would just take BTC. Probably taken, though.

Spot on. Used to do a lot of business there, on the selling end. I would go as far as to say the majority of my "peers" were using fraudulent methods. I was exposed to some of them, and carding is surprisingly unpopular compared to other methods.
