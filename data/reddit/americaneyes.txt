Like most people, I started out very clueless about money, though I have a master's degree in computer science. I knew a lot about my field, but almost nothing about money. Over the last couple of years I have slowly been teaching myself all about it, and it is absolutely fascinating!

The US government is 20 trillion dollars in debt and growing. At some point, the chickens will come home to roost and they will have to devalue the currency (reduce purchasing power by printing more) to fulfill the obligations. The people (who own 70% of this debt) will pay the most.
Yes all governments back their currencies... until they don't. Just like Zimbabwe. When something like hyperinflation happens, there is simply nothing the government can do, there just isn't *faith* in the currency. Sure the US can go to war to capture oil etc., but only against limited countries. And you have seen how that has turned out in Iraq etc. War is incredibly destructive, even for the winner! And of course, we will never (hopefully) go to war against Russia or China. Therefore *backed by the military* is only of limited utility. Only good enough so people can continue to have *faith* in the dollar note.
Even a gold standard won't help. I still own gold and silver and always will, but gold is valuable for the same reason crypto is valuable. We *all* give it value, and we all *trust* that everyone else will continue to give it value tomorrow. Besides there are thousands of years of history to gold, so it probably has the *faith* of most people out there. Antonopoulous was spot on, money is a massive massive shared hallucination. 
There is no *inherent value* in gold, as goldbugs like to believe. Here is a litmus test question for *inherent value*:
**What would this item be worth, if the whole world thought it was worthless?** Let's apply it to two items:
1. Eggs: It has inherent value because I can make an omelette with it and satisfy my hunger. This is true even if the whole world calls it worthless.
2. Gold: Can be used in limited applications in electronics, but other than that it has no *inherent value*. If the whole world decided gold was worthless, no one will buy our gold and it is no longer a store of value. 
The same applies to cryptos, it is only more obvious because there is nothing tangible behind it.
However cryptos are decentralized, and designed to be deflationary. Bitcoins are limited in quantity, and the adoption of bitcoin is more like a *self-fulfilling prophecy* at this point. As more and more people gain faith in bitcoin, and the price rises, even more people will pile in and gain faith in it! If/Once that *critical mass* is reached, and people start to have *faith* that bitcoin will always store value... that's it. It will be almost like a religion at that point. Running entirely on faith, but with tremendous power and trust of the masses.

I agree with Examples make it more clear.
Most people have a limited amount they can invest in this. Say for arguments sake, 30k. At 3k per coin, they can buy 10. At 5k per coin,  they can only buy 6. Definitely a huge difference especially if btc does go to 100k.
Whereas at $3 or $5 you are correct. Most people wouldn't hit their *budget goal* at those prices, instead they would hit their * goal*. i.e. most would have bought like 1000 coins (at either $3 or $5) and hodl'd.
Finally yes, I'm a pre-k math student.
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:15:10
I'm guessing from context that it is a tiny leftover amount in a wallet. E.g. 0.00001 bitcoin. If the price goes to hypothetically a million, it will be worth collecting that dust.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:55:35
I explained in the second paragraph above, with italics. Yes the proportional difference is the same, but with the absolute value so small at 3 vs 5 it doesn't matter. Because you would have bought the same fixed number of coins, not hit your budget limit. At 3000 vs 5000 most people will max out their budget instead.

There is a lot to Bitcoin besides speculation. Good old libertarian minded decentralization, removing the ability of banks to print money, p2p transactions, digital store of value, etc. Other cryptocurrencies have more properties like smart contracts, anonymity, and so on.
I agree that many of the entrants into this space now, and for some time hence, will be speculators. When we have a 2000-style dot-com version of the cryptocurrency crash in the future, a lot of these speculators will exit and price will drop as you say. This will be, IMO, an excellent time to buy for people that believe in the underlying tech.
I truly believe cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech is here to stay, and fundamentally transform and disrupt existing methodologies. Maybe the Google/Amazon of the crypto world won't be bitcoin, but you can be sure a few will survive the great crypto purge and thrive.

Yep. Remember that Bitcoin has the most hash power. Attacking bitcoin in prohibitively expensive, at least for now. Attacking one of the numerous copycoins is easy, and several 51% attacks against other cryptos have happened recently.
Not to also mention the brand recognition of the original crypto. 
Remember why you got into this. Fiat will continue to depreciate and fail spectacularly all of a sudden. All the central bank QE and low interest rate environment partying will not end well. Remember '08. Worse is coming. Winter is coming.

You are 100% correct. But people will keep arguing that just because CPI is low there is no inflation. Yes, the stupid basket of goods that they buy to compute CPI isn't inflated, but houses, stocks, etc are very much inflated.

One of the goals for Bitcoin was to be decentralized. ASIC resistance enables the average Joe Sixpack to mine crypto (solo or in a pool). Without ASIC resistance, the entities with most $$ and best ASIC designs would win out i.e. the mining would get centralized.

Fair enough. And that would raise the price of gold. But would this demand be enough to raise gold to $1300 an ounce, purely on the basis of industrial usage? That's my point.
@_date: 2019-04-15 18:16:31
You are correct that it would still have value in industrial uses. But those are limited for gold (unlike silver). Gold's primary "value" is as money. It is very doubtful that gold would be $1300 an ounce without this value.
@_date: 2019-04-15 07:05:20
Gold does not have intrinsic value. And I say this as a goldbug. Most of gold's value is derived from the fact that people value it because they think other people value it. And it has been "money" for thousands of years, so unlikely to change. I still buy both gold and bitcoin as a hedge against the banking and economic system.
Here's a litmus test to determine whether something has "intrinsic value": What would be the value of X if the whole world thought it was worthless? Once you can answer this, you can determine X's intrinsic value.
Something that has intrinsic value -- eggs. If the whole world thought it was worthless, it would still have value, because I could use it to cook an omelette and feed my family. Something that has no intrinsic value -- gold, because if the whole world thought it was worthless, it would in fact be just a shiny rock. At least silver has plenty of industrial uses, and thus is of "value" to someone.
Bitcoin's "value" comes from its network and all the electricity that goes into securing it. But it fails the "intrinsic value" test as well. And that's OK. It **is** digital gold, that is the closest metaphor.
@_date: 2019-04-15 07:11:05
This is the correct answer. Please have a hedge against the current economic system, it is already on its last legs.

I don't understand. Why didn't they cash out their original investment and then let it ride? So much easier to hold that way. Unless they got in during Dec/Jan I suppose. Then they are shit out of luck. :-(

I'm not OP, but I will admit that as a computer scientist, my knowledge of finance comes from a variety of sources online, and that my understanding might even be wrong. How about telling us exactly **how** OP was wrong, instead of berating him as "uneducated"?
Didn't the government literally create currency out of thin air during QE? Sure they didn't engage the printing press, but manipulated some ledger entries to add extra zeros at the end. As for "unwinding", shouldn't we wait until the Fed actually *succeeds* before we declare the grand Quantitative-Easing/Quantitative-Tightening experiment to be a success?


The US is 20 trillion dollars in debt, and 70% of this is debt held by it's people. Surely they aren't going to bomb us with these shiny aircraft carriers when the bill comes due? No. More likely they will borrow again, and if that doesn't happen they will devalue the currency by *more* printing, and give us our FULL amounts owed. Which will have no purchasing power left due to devaluation.
China has about 8-10% of the debt I believe. I highly doubt we are going to bomb China as well. That will be one hell of a rude awakening. 
Please feel free to correct me, since I will again readily admit that finance is not my field. Let's engage in useful discussion rather than name calling. Thanks!

As a contrarian viewpoint, real estate financed through debt is a great investment if you expect hyperinflation. Hyperinflation benefits debtors, since they have to pay back with money that has reduced purchasing power. 
i.e. Buy a house with debt, and then let hyperinflation get rid of your debt. Said another way, you could buy a $1 million house with debt, and after hyperinflation, you could sell your chair for $1 million and pay off the house. Of course, this assumes fixed interest debt, and non-callable loans (otherwise the banks would call in the loans before hyperinflation truly kicks in).

Don't blame yourself. Anyone that tells you they could see this magnitude of correction, or that they could see the top, are lying.
My advice... When you are sitting on 5500%, you definitely should cash out some next time. Even if you think the market will go up still. I've done this before. *Become greedy*, and kept holding even though I've made a killing. Then it crashes, and before I know it, I'm down way low. Remember, until you cash out everything is just paper profits.
My advice is to set certain points in your mind, and cash out at those intervals (little bit at a time). Before you know it you have the original investment plus decent profits. Then when the downturn hits, you can weather it out without panicking.

^ ^ ^ This is it right here. The central banks, as well as commercial banks (via fractional reserve lending) get to print money for free. Then they loan you the money, and you work your ass off your whole life to pay back your stupid house, car, and other loans. Then you die. 
So what ends up happening is that you exchanged your labor and time throughout your whole life, for little pieces of green paper, that you also pay back in tax and interest. Meanwhile the bankers do nothing productive, profit off of you, and blow money on hookers and cocaine. And if they make risky loans that go bad, they get bailed out, because they are "too big to fail".
The whole system is a way to keep people in debt-servitude... good obedient little servants that worship their overlords.

He meant that it should be 225 lbs. Four 45s and the 45 lb bar. It would be extremely weird for someone to brag about 220 lbs. They would much rather train a bit more and get a PR with 2 plates on either side before bragging.

I completely agree with Gold is good and safe and everyone should have a small % of their portfolio in precious metals.
However bitcoin has tremendous potential, and we haven't hit the peak yet. For sure, there will be crashes. During/after a future major crash, the speculators will cash out and exit and that will be the *best* time to buy BTC. Finally bitcoin also might fail due to reasons completely outside the scope of the technology (i.e. it does take some luck as well). 
Invest 5% of your portfolio in BTC, and prepare to write it off completely if shit hits the fan. The potential is definitely there. But there is still tremendous risk for potential tremendous reward.
