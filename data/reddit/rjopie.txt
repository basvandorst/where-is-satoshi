It doesn't work with bitcoin.
Because unlike with traditional currency, when a saver deposits cash in an account the money still exists for him. The bank then "creates" new money based on these deposits to loan out. So the deposited money exists twice. The saver still has access to his deposits if he wants it. And the borrower has his money too.
This doesn't work with bitcoin because if the saver ever wants his bitcoin back, he can't because the borrower now has them. Unlike fiat the bank can't just create new bitcoin to loan out and bitcoins can only exist in place at a time. So this model of traditional banking doesn't work. 
Peer to peer bitcoin loans are possible though. But trust is an issue.

This is what PayPal have done for years. You share your private bank information with one organisation rather than every merchant. ApplePay also does this.

this is a scam right?

Honestly it takes 5 minutes to buy bitcoin on localbitcoins.com

Buy them like everyone else has to:

You just do a domestic bank transfer to the sellers account. Why are you finding simple things so difficult? Maybe bitcoin is not for you

If you boot one of your old computers using [Ubuntu]( from a Live CD, I don't see how it can be compromised since it is using a fresh OS image.
Alternatively use [VirtualBox]( to run an Ubuntu VM. Disable networking on the VM so it remains offline.

How many satoshi per day do you get per erupter? It might not be profitable now but if you hold those satoshi until they are worth a cent each, then you're in the money.

If it becomes unprofitable to mine, there will be less miners, which means that the difficulty recalculates and it will become profitable to mine. 
Its a self regulating system.

Bitcoin and keep it long term.

You're very wrong because Overstock announced they do about $10,000 sales per day in btc. Quite a lot of btc to cash out you think? No not really because there are $12,500 worth of btc mined every 10 minutes. That's over $1,800,000 of new btc created every day. So do you see how Overstock btc sales is really incredibly tiny and wouldn't affect price at all.
Yes you need to add in Dell, Newegg etc but I doubt their sales exceed Overstock yet, on a per day average. Fact is, merchant sell pressure is almost non existent compared to the newly mined btc that are just being created.

Hopefully it makes bitcoin more appealing and less scary/techy, which I think is a problem that bitcoin adoption is facing.

BTC is volatile. But only in one direction.

emailed them a few hours ago. nothing back yet. how long does it typically take?
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:05:00
Well your analysis was wrong, since we just went way over $1047 and it certainly didn't crash at that price like you predicted. It's now $1070 so you might need to refine your analysis :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:45:42
You could try 
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:39:34
Because it's not going back down to $920
You will end up buying back in at a higher price than you sold for.

but you can't hack a blockchain.info account only knowing an email address?

I think you'll be waiting a long time
