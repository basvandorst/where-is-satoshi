If bitcoin is not halal then buying a companies share is not halal. 
If bitcoin is not halal then gold is not halal.
If bitcoin is not halal then silver is not halal.
Those are just example.
Bitcoin has value just like other valued commodities aka platinum, oil, sugar, orange juice etc.
The more demand for those commodities the more of said commodities value would go up and vice versa.
Jordan shoes has values depending on the year and model.
Owning a land is the same maybe ypu bought a land for a cheap price today and tomorrow it might worth ten folds. 
So yea bitcoin is halal and i am a muslim and i regularly buy it and hold a bunch of em. 
If you think is haram please give them to me ha ;)

Currently i have 24.59241100-B. Have 21.05876745-B in a trezor wallet. Bought 'em for around $450-$600. Will hold 21 coins for life whether it reaches a mill or zero. Unless i can buy a house, a car, a land, life stocks, golf and silver etc. Till then am holding and buying as much as i can. It sucks that circle discontinued their bitcoin services. Was the best place to throw in extra dough after my bills and regular savings. What ever was left i would just buy btc instead of weed or turning up and waisting money. 
I do have 53 xmr. 50 dash. 50 LTC and 50 ETH.
Im 23years now. I found out about btc around 2009 and told my self i'll buy in 5 to 6 years to see if it's still would be around. I was in high school and broke. It sucks what i know than what i did before but could've, would've, should've. I thought it would only work for gamers and kids like chucky cheese but online. Live and learn. 
Then again gov pressure or some other form of manipulation can drive btc noes bown. But im in for the ride.
