your 'math doesn't add up' post encouraged me to sell at $45. thanks!

this man is quite right. bitcoin is never going to reach the masses if the future services are as inaccessible as they are now. 
I know we're still in the early stages, but we need a better alternative to buy bitcoins and it needs to come soon.

the market is too volatile to predict anything right now. I'm waiting out this ridiculousness in hopes of the market prices settling down and stabilizing. At that point, I will buy.

We all appreciate your work but I see a couple of problems with how you're dealing with customers here. I hope I don't come across as bossy, but..
1) why do we have to find some obscure thread on a very general bitcoin forum to get any help? 
2) why is there no warning on the bitinstant page that says many users are experiencing problems? your services platform is its speed. that's why we pay the extra fees. when that doesn't work, there's no reason to use bitinstant.
COMMUNICATE with your customers! own up to your problems. trying to hide them and acting like nothing is wrong is just going to piss people off and it's going to hurt your business in the long run.
