Still don't understand what you're trying to get at haha, Visa is accepted worldwide and has nothing to do with USD which you seem to be implying by your first example. The original intention of my first comment was to address that bitcoin can be easily used to buy goods and services. Just because there is an intermediary and automatic exchange step doesn't mean bitcoin isn't being used in a transaction. I'm not trying to debate where it is on the spectrum between asset and currency.

Is that currency conversion step supposed to be a disqualifier? You're still transacting with bitcoin. If bitcoin were proliferated and accepted everywhere it's still another currency. The value at which crypto is traded is always gonna be pitted against  some other currency, cept maybs way in the future if it's vice versa lol. TenX and Visa handle the currency swap for you, but if a business or company "accepts bitcoin" they're going to take it to an exchange and swap it for their local currency

You certainly can anywhere that Visa is accepted with the [TenX card]( You can deposit Bitcoin, Ethereum, and any other ERC-20 token with minimum fees onto your TenX card (or balance, they're planning on adding Apple Pay and Google Wallet compatibility this year). There are a few similar cards but I believe TenX has the largest user base. Their token is also rewarded as cash back monthly, and holding the token generates dividends in the form of Ethereum.
