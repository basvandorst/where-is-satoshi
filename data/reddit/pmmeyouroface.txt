Is bitcoin doomed?
@_date: 2019-03-04 08:15:38
I sold some bitcoin to take care of expenses. I have the worst luck in the world, so prepare for the BTC PRICE EXPLOSION on 3/4/2019

I didn't bother reading that. Just to let you know. ;)

HODL HODL HODL HODL LMAO 
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:41:27
I hope it drops to $200 again.
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:36:28
It will dip this summer when all these jobless idiots need to pay rent during school break, then surge right after student loan refunds come out. Facts.
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:36:06
I'm pulling the plug on grandma and putting everything into bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:34:52
There is no definition of a "dip" in Bitcoin. It might keep slowly falling all the way to $200 and stay there for the next 30 years, who's to say.
@_date: 2018-06-10 05:09:58
Why do you monkeys say HODL instead of hold?
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:24:51
Bought another $150 worth today, I hope it keeps tanking.
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:40:35
Which one? Nothing has name recognition like Bitcoin which is all it needs.

@_date: 2019-02-26 09:44:17
Or the idea is just terrible.
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:26:03
Just like OP with his own address in this photo?
@_date: 2019-01-06 09:35:29
No no, you didn't understand. He said invest everything.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:53:55
Well, whatever. Can it be done or not?
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:53:31
I have found no information on WHY the dip happened however. Anyone have info? The bounce back of ~$1000 in under 5 minutes felt suspicious also.

@_date: 2018-02-02 09:35:54
Based on this fact, I am actually the one who controls the Bitcoin price. Bribe me.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:40:33
But I prayed to Satoshi last night and bitcoin went up $1000 in a day. Explain.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:40:55
Buddy the dawn came and went lol.

@_date: 2018-02-02 12:50:42
Everyone knew about it in 2013 also.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:18:31
That's disgustingly pretentious of you.
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:17:39
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:39:03
There's a realistic possibility you'll be waiting years for it to come back.

No daily discussion thread? The crash is going to be that bad, huh?
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:01:09
It literally only dropped back down to its average trend line before the artificial spike to 17k, and now it's resumed the steady upward trend it's been on the past two years. Mind-boggling, really.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:29:42
It's funny because this is a steady, controlled downward spiral, not an elevator drop. Bitcoin may be down for a long time to come.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:19:53
Can't wait to see how cheap these delicious morsels get over the next few days.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:03:54
You didn't help, thanks.

Does Coinbase allow stop orders through the app? I want to buy when it hits a certain price.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:12:02
Been awhile since we've had such a good day to buy!
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:55:18
This shawty's gettin *low*
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:58:44
Dude. The news outlets were HEAVILY covering Bitcoin for months as it topped $1000 for the first time. You probably weren't old enough to remember so why argue?
@_date: 2018-12-21 04:29:46
Based on...nothing. Nothing at all.
