If the price of AM shares continue to climb, you may never be able to catch up with less than 15 or so shares of AM already. If you have enough such that you get more dividends than the price increases weekly, get burnside. If not, get TAT.

Frankly this is my thinking as well. BTC has been reasonably stable for a while now, but there aren't really any new products or services being introduced into the ecosystem except more ways to try and make more BTC and a very small number of hopefuls accepting BTC for their business. 
I have lost faith in BTC as a currency, and am not particularly interested in speculating it as a commodity. I got in early, and pulled out recently to pay for a college semester. To me, that's enough.
I'll wait for more products before I get back in, or wait for BTC's successor that solves this fundamental problem, at which point I'll try my hand in mining like I did back in 2012. As long as BTC continues to be centralized with unreliable exchanges, and has little value as a currency, I have no more interest in it.

The currency may be anonymous, but nothing else about the transaction is. They create a single use address for each exchange and tie it to the order, along with your name, phone, and address.

I would suggest that most people who are currently receiving dividends on BTC-TC from Burnside to reinvest those dividends into TAT. With the insane climb occurring in AM shares, reinvesting your dividends as soon as possible makes sense as long as you believe the price will continue to rise.
Naturally, as soon as you feel that the price will decline, you should sell all your shares. In the words of Louis CK, "But until then, WEEEEEEE!"

With more and more investors with A LOT of money and with more and more corporations with A LOT of money throwing their hat into the ring with Bitcoin, the more secure Bitcoin becomes from the (mostly meaningless) government intervention. 
The lobbying power of these people is one of the strongest assets Bitcoin enthusiasts could have on their side.

 [Burnside]( and [TAT]( run two separate ASIC MINER assets. While they both are pass-throughs of AM shares, TAT are 100:1 of 1 share, while AM-PT is 1:1 of 1 share.

I'm growing more and more worried by the lack of competition in almost all the spaces AM operates. AM is a great company, but I desperately want more companies operating in its space.
Where are the competing mining companies? Where are the competent ASIC manufacturers?

Dividends will be higher on weeks of auctions. I think there are a few more in the pipeline. That aside, they're extremely keen on continually scaling their hash rate, and that means higher dividends.
