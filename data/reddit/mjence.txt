You can send bitcoin from the Cash app to a private wallet.  From the main screen go to your profile, tap where it shows your Bitcoin funds, then scroll down to "Withdraw Bitcoin."  I've done it many times.  My app says there is a $2,000 per day, $5,000 per week withdrawal limit.

Yup.  Which is why I transfer it to my own wallet right after I buy it. :-)

Personally I pay tax on all my crypto sales, but I totally get where you're coming from with those feelings.

You can buy coins instantly on Coinbase with a credit card (or Paypal, I think?), but on GDAX you have to first do either a wire transfer or bank transfer of funds, then purchase the coins on the exchange, and those take a little more time and/or effort.
You're right though, if you can plan ahead and are comfortable using an exchange, you can avoid fees almost entirely by doing a bank transfer to GDAX instead of using a CC on Coinbase, and you can still take advantage of the free withdrawals to a wallet.

Coinbase is just a user-friendly front end that's more like a bank than anything else.  When you buy coins on Coinbase, you're actually just buying coins from Coinbase's own supply, and nothing is actually transferred to you, they just make a ledger entry that you've purchased X amount of Y coin.  That's why when you use your credit card there, the coins "instantly" show up in your account.  It's also why everyone says you shouldn't leave your coins there--Coinbase controls the private keys, and not you.
Like others have said, GDAX is a trading platform or exchange like Bittrex and others, though it's limited to the 3 coins available on Coinbase.  It is owned by the Coinbase folks and the accounts are linked.
Edit:  I wanted to add, in answer to your last question:  GDAX isn't linked to your private wallets, but you can use it to send your coins to other wallets for free.  I've also successfully used it to send coins directly to other exchanges, like Bittrex, Binance, and Changelly, to purchase altcoins that aren't available on GDAX or Coinbase.  You just use the "withdraw" procedure I described in my post above and enter the address for your desired destination wallet.

One little secret about Coinbase is that you can actually move coins from your Coinbase account to a personal wallet for free, if you use their exchange platform GDAX.  Go to gdax.com, and you should be able to sign in with your Coinbase login info.  Then from the trading screen of the coin you want to move, click "deposit," then click "Coinbase account" as the source.  The transfer from your Coinbase account to GDAX is free and usually instant.  Once the coins show up in your balance on the trading screen, then you can click "withdraw" and choose to withdraw to your private wallet address.  This withdrawal is also free and usually pretty fast.
