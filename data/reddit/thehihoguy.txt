So in short: TO THE MOOOOOON
@_date: 2018-08-03 11:49:33
Wasnt it because of the rejection of the ETF?
@_date: 2018-08-17 09:41:09
Whatever floats bitcoins boat...i guess...
@_date: 2018-08-27 15:24:40
How can you make sure that no one will copy the data from your service?
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:42:15
But so many ETF's have been denied in the past, what makes this one stand out?
@_date: 2018-08-17 09:53:53
And we know how the last chinese new year went for btc....
@_date: 2018-08-07 10:06:47
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:20:43
Im getting ready for tomorrow, at what time is the decision? so i know when to strike :D
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:06:21
how? can you please specify?
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:01:12
What do you guys think on how the chances are for ETF tomorrow?
@_date: 2018-08-17 09:51:58
like GridCoin or similar?
@_date: 2018-08-23 10:14:06
At least youd have free advertisement of your shitcoin "ETF" every month in the bitcoin subreddit...
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:33:25
Good point!
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:23:08
And you know what? For sure the reward goes to one chump who just started to mine on his private pc for fun :D
@_date: 2018-08-17 13:16:44
What if he just lost the private keys to his main wallet?
@_date: 2018-08-06 12:02:34
and do stuff
@_date: 2018-08-27 15:25:35
If you replaced all money with BTC, dont you think people will start war for BTC?
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:02:31
coins.ph is probably a good way to start...
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:31:53
Great answer, appreciate the poetical answer:D
@_date: 2018-08-07 12:04:19
Isnt that a parody website like the onion?
@_date: 2019-03-27 00:31:40
But sunscribe!
@_date: 2019-03-19 15:14:54


@_date: 2019-03-22 14:14:10
HUH, what is it good for? Absolutely NOTHING! AHHHHHHHH **sings**
@_date: 2019-03-20 12:24:09
Blockchain that camera, its the solution for everything /s
@_date: 2019-03-12 15:31:02


How did he manage to pay the house fully without mortgage and even a second house for that amount of money?
@_date: 2019-11-07 18:27:48
That is uses as much power as some countries and that its a waste therefor to even look at BTC
I heard that one the most.
@_date: 2019-11-27 19:00:56
I hope he gets caught, vandalism is just plain stupid....
@_date: 2019-11-07 18:29:04
Tanks ofc
@_date: 2018-10-01 07:24:47
@_date: 2019-11-28 07:38:42
Hardware wallets and btc price in general
@_date: 2019-11-06 22:29:27
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:58:35
how so?
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:57:28
Worked pretty well for Venezuela..../s
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:40:01
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:45:35
Trump is Satoshi Nakamoto and he successfully played us....
@_date: 2019-08-14 08:45:45
To escape the volatility of crypto for a while without going the extra loop to cash out to fiat. that way youre more flexible to invest back into crypto and save on fees.
@_date: 2019-02-06 13:35:26
transaction fees are much higher but the stocks are more stable compared to crypto
@_date: 2019-02-04 16:16:10
Soooo....we should free every criminal with a heartbroken mother? seems legit....
@_date: 2019-10-25 11:25:19
Im kinda speechless of this....
@_date: 2019-02-05 07:48:01
I fully agree with your perspective on this case. he did not deserve such a long sentence while violent cases get far less. But reality is, that most of people actually think he is innocent and never deserved prison in the first place. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 15:03:06


@_date: 2019-12-16 10:58:19
Because of your attitude....we are still in early adoption, so not everything is one click...do your research and be nice, ask people and they will help
@_date: 2019-12-05 05:59:10
Hmm ok, question, what happens if the app support runs out due to whatever reasons? How can you save your btc on the card?
@_date: 2019-12-04 23:16:33
No background info about the company. Is it really swiss or a scammer using swiss reputation of welath management?
@_date: 2019-12-02 15:14:45
Check supported coins and compare to what you need. Then second thing is the handling, do you need big buttons for fat fingers or is a ledger ok as well?
Third, how important is it for you that the source is open or closed?
Thsoe are the main things to worry, the rest is quite same level of both products...
@_date: 2019-04-01 18:51:27
When youre desperate for karma....
@_date: 2019-04-02 10:23:11
lets be honest here, even when it was stable we looked at it every 5 min...its just like the fridge thing, where you open the fridge again in hope it has more snacks...
@_date: 2019-04-09 05:32:29
@_date: 2019-04-05 11:54:30
You just dont want us to be rich and keep it to yourself, why should i trust you? /s
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:13:02
Complains about people predicting....predicts the market to go down....smh
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:58:46
Expected a shitty clickbait blog....but found an actually interesting and good written theory with formulas...nicely done!
@_date: 2018-11-17 13:10:21


Its not a valid representation of the public or useful statement as the target audience who voted are all followers of Ron Paul or are twitter user in the first place aka very limited spectrum of the public opinions.....
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:00:17
Jeeeeesus take the wheeeeeel....
@_date: 2018-11-18 13:31:30
Most people are not aware of that option. Personally dont use it as the fee is quite high compared to coinbase or whatnot....dunno how the demand for it is though
@_date: 2018-11-12 09:26:42
Yes, would be awesome and promotes the adoption of crypto.
There is a booking plattform coming up from the TOA project, where you can book hotel in BTC and TOA!
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:59:56
Hmm true hash is not necessarily attached to monetary value....always thought that the hashrate is like the vote of the people for what they believe in and therefor decide the value of it.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:11:42
Thanks, great explanation. makes sense
@_date: 2019-01-23 14:00:36
Dont use exchange wallets. Either have your own wallet or one that lets you adjust the transaction fee. Myetherwallet for example lets you adjust the transaction fee. THe lower the transaction fee the slower the processing of the transaction but it will be still done.
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:59:56
Dunno why but i always prefered Generation Y of pokemon....
@_date: 2018-11-12 07:43:06
Just wait for chinese new year /s
@_date: 2018-11-12 12:22:54


Still waiting for the launch of the booking website, so lets see
no, lemme check on those two
@_date: 2018-03-01 10:15:16
You prevent single point of failure or abuse of power by a single entity (censoring/unfair conditions/etc). The truth is broadly available for the people to judge instead hidden in a company folder like for example in Enron before.

@_date: 2018-11-18 14:42:29
You can ask literally anyone to lend you the phone as it doesnt charge anything for it but only sends one sms....sooooo not that hard to get around
@_date: 2018-03-23 08:26:30
why may?
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:26:32
One of the big BTC miner went to a BCH fork to fight a hash war. Is no one afraid, that this person will stay on that fork, attract more miners there and therefor make it the most dominant "BTC"? Wouldnt that decrease BTC value immensily if people would suddenly decide that the fork is the real "BTC"?
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:48:31
Yes, thats a given. Only needs some FUD and it would drop hard again. 8800 is not unrealistic.
@_date: 2019-01-14 07:28:35
Not the best spokeswoman for bitcoin....afair shes the one selling snake oil crystals to remove any disease or illness.
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:17:11
Depends on context, but i assume you mean IRC chats? 
Check out:
You can login into any irc node (server), then into channels (topics) of chats...
@_date: 2019-01-22 11:24:32
not in EU with GDPR...
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:37:00
But on the other hand....according to murphys law, the knife is more likely to fall towards you
@_date: 2018-11-12 09:28:28
My problem back then was the missing community and no communication of the team....is it any better now?
@_date: 2019-01-07 11:43:56
Nah, just send it to the elon musk website, he will double it and send it back to you! /s
@_date: 2018-11-18 13:33:03
One of the most anonymous way to buy btc beside localbitcoin trades imo as you need only some random phone number to confirm the pin upon payment
@_date: 2018-11-12 14:40:37
Does someone know a store where you can buy a finished product of the Bitcoin Lottory device? see link for reference, would be cool to have even though i dont have the technical knowledge for raspberry pi's
@_date: 2018-11-18 13:37:16
The option still exists and you can buy up to 500 chf worth of btc. Rest dunno, must be answered by someone else
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:12:34
someone just talked about it;_;
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:58:31
Heh mac....
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:16:59
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:27:35
Nodes can be also cryptocurrency nodes. A node is a local copy of the blockchain on a computer that is online. The blockchain node will help the network to verify transactions.
Whats LN?
Dunno about channel in that context though, maybe someone else knows more
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:35:46
RemindMe! 16 days "What happened to the drive with all the BTC"
@_date: 2018-03-02 11:29:42
haha:D well said
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:14:05
not at this rate of decline....
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:38:32
top notch!
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:31:41
Doesnt matter if he did it on mistake or on purpose...if he can do that, its not really decentralized....
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:19:19
Good or bad day ahead? Lets see....
@_date: 2018-07-10 08:58:11
Glad to hear:)
@_date: 2018-07-17 09:20:30
Well, we can still hope for the 10. august rally on ETF....
@_date: 2018-07-10 08:50:25
And your Excel?
@_date: 2018-07-13 09:18:45
I think the data combined with the comments on here tell us one concrete fact -- no one on here has any fucking clue what BTC is doing, or why.
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:18:50
Anyway, you still have the halving next year
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:07:56
Sorry, I cant help you further in that regard:/
Its the only asian forum i know
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:49:54
I think china has 8BTC as bitcointalk....but you would need to know how to read chinese...
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:55:22
they said the same about 6.5k

438 Bitcoins Worth Nearly $3.5 Million Stolen From Exchange In India, CSO Accused 
@_date: 2019-05-22 13:07:53
So by your logic, I would be forced to deliver the car keys back to you? even if i have to drive there or pay the postal fee to send it to you?
@_date: 2019-05-17 10:26:43
So did the guy waste ALL his bitcoin back then or only a part of it?
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:12:11
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:11:36
same was said last christmas:(
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:11:55
Is this a joke or are you for real asking?
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:25:48
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:40:44
Like fiat?:P
Haha jk would be awesome if they accepted crypto
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:39:33
hahaha, thanks for the link. was entertaining to see and flabbergasting on how people can fall for this....
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:55:42
Greed and emotions....
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:38:30
Draw Lightnings on your body and call me Satoshi! You naughty crypto enthusiast!
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:59:47
To the MOON! /s
@_date: 2018-12-19 09:08:01
I mean...its a good thing....just feels a lil bit wrong that its "only" 10k for a company that earns a ton of money....
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:16:05
Nice, glad to hear
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:32:11
Clouds are always online and therefor always exposed to attacks.
Lets assume you dont get hacked and you use a different complex password on dropbox than on other online plattform to minimalize the threat....youll still have the issue that all free dropbox accounts are in posession of the dropbox company and therefor they can terminate it without much discussion if they like it. There have been cases with other cloud storage before where the company just shuts it down.
Best would be to still store it on a paper offline or airgapped device (hardware wallet, usb, offline computer, etc)
