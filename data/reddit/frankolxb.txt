Bitcoin: for a fair and transparent financial system.

From Andreas: "Bitcoin isn't just money for the internet, it is the internet of money".
So a good slogan that  encompasses more than just the currency aspect would be:
Bitcoin is not just money for the internet,  it is the internet of money!

The first practical application is a distributed exchange which is scheduled to be live on March 15th. 
Ethereum has not even started their initial funding phase/IPO, nobody can buy ether at the moment, but you can buy mastercoin already. Ethereum is a much more ambitious project  that may take years.

These guys manage millions and cannot even setup a coffee shop properly. 
"Mt.Gox is actively taking all coffee orders in bitcoin and expects to serve the first latte in about 2 to 3 weeks".
So according to the statement they take already coffee orders in BTC but coffee is only available in 2-3 weeks, Sry lol. 
Typically Mt.gox, this highlights their mediocre planning, organizational, and management skills as well as their top notch PR department.

Just an idea, did you use a comma (,) or a dot (.) in the BTC amount? I can only withdraw BTC if I use a dot so this might be your problem, if not just ignore my post.

Typical reddit, just pointing things out, not even raising my opinion and I get downvoted lol. I just wanted to point out that Mastercoin will probably  be the first project to go live. I do not care if Mastercoin, namecoin, ethereum or OT becomes the new norm. This subreddit seems to be allergic just to the mentioning of Mastercoin.

2% on all transactions is too much IMO. People are better of using a credit card in this case.

True, if amazon would accept BTC tomorow only a  very small percentage of customers would use it.
I believe that for bitcoin to gain wider  attraction as a currency companies need to go  beyond just offering the possibility of paying with bitcoin. They need to allow discounts for bitcoin payments. The masses will only start using it if they can see a tangible benefit. In other words, some businesses might start accepting bitcoins in the future to gain new customers and get slightly higher margins on these orders, however for bitcoin to be mainstream this reduction in cost need to be shared between the parties. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 12:09:17
Do not forget the 15th March the Mastercoin distributed exchange is supposed to go live. This will be the first major decentralised exchange.
This exchange will be built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain benefiting from Bitcoin´s security infrastructure. It will be by far the most advanced exchange as the use of the Mastercoin protocol will allow new ways of investing. People will for example be able to short BTCs or any other asset which is currently impossible on any exchange.

Tipping the devs is important. However it might be even more important to tip the foundation itself. By tipping devs, you only increase their personal revenue which motivates them as an individual. Tipping the bitcoin foundation on the other hand is more important as the funds collected by the foundation itself can be used to hire more and more developers. I believe that both tipping the devs and tipping the foundation is important. By tipping devs directly you motivate them to continue with the good work. On the other hand by tipping the foundation you allow it to grow faster and engage more devs.
In other words the question who to tip: the devs or the foundation is a question of **Quality vs Quantity**.

I suppose there is insurance on it, not sure up to how much though. Anyways robbers would have to crack my bip38 wallets so even in this scenario the robbers should not get my coins.
Safe enough for me, i could have used 3 boxes at different locations with multisig and 1 key in each box I suppose. I think this would be overkill for the amount I am storing.

Seriously? you guys never heart of the silk road, a historical road that was used among others to transport silk from china.

It is so easy nowadays to undertake a market research online. The altcoin mining niche is even easier to target as most miners rely heavily on forums and other specific social medias to share their knowledge. 
Social medias nowadays,  allow to cheaply and effectively target a very small sub segment of the market. 
These companies should figure out which social medias are most relevant and ask the community itself what they would need. The product should be the result of the cooperation between the community and the company. That way both parties win: consumers get exactly what they ask for and businesses can make sure their products will match actual demand.

I am sorry, but the franchising story is a joke. The company was only open for business a couple weeks ago. Who in their right minds would want to become a franchisee of a  company that is not even profitable? Only one branch which is located in Cypres which still does not show profit yet, not very convincing imo. Btw  i wanna point out that i am an investor in neobee, so i criticise my  own investment position which is relaitvely stupid ;). 
My point is that  in order to offer a franchise model a company needs to prove its business model  is viable which neoboe did not do at the moment. They need first  to show a profit before  thinking about franchising, anything else would be irresponsible. Reading this comments already makes me wonder where do they  plan to go? I agree Greece would be the  first option. However in addition to proving the profitability of  one branch they could open some more which would result in more credibility for the potential  of the company. Why franchise a businee when you can open another branch yourself with the profit of the first branch??????  This  should already point to a red flag!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please  NeoBee give the investors real numbers before cruising in fantasy land. I want to see high adoption rate in Cyprus and more branches !!!!!!!!!! Make yourself credible!!!

I still have my BTC but their value went down quite a bit. So regardless if I own the same amount of BTC, I purchasing power. The price might go up again, but I could have bought more BTC if Id invested fiat now into it.
So everybody looses! at least in the short term.

Check out Mastercoin:
Mastercoin is build on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and is working on smart contracts. 
Ethereum on the other hand will rely on its own blockchain. The ethereum project is still in its infancy.

Quick update: My BTCs finally released! More than 48 hrs ago i tried to withdraw 0.5 BTC and the transaction got stuck, never showed in the blockchain. Last couple days I did more than 10 BTC withdrawals at MtGox and only one got stuck, now  afer 48 hrs finally unblocked. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:22:19
Considering point1, basically Neo has accomplished nothing in Cyprus yet. The Neo representative on the video acknowledges that as of now you can do nothing in Cyprus with Bitcoins. 
In my personal opinion this does not look very promising. The company opens a branch and has not even any products it can offer to its customers for more than a month. Looks like bad management to me.

I should have pointed out that I do not see bitcoin hashes as useless in any way. The power behind the network, aka the mining, the energy that is needed to extract the bitcoin commodity(currency) and moreover to verify the ledger keeping it safe is definitively not useless. However I saw some people speaking of the idea of using mining in an even more efficient way, and parallels with the SETI project popped into my head.

Information provided by the blockchain should be more than enough
@_date: 2014-03-25 12:24:24
This is management related information and there is no reason to make it available to customers. These statuses are used internally and I am even surprised that you know they exist. 
Many organisations use such codes but they never make them public, this is management related.
IMO you make a point though by saying in your post that the  audit that has been performed is only related to the BTCs Kraken has and not to the fiat money they have in their bank account. So this information  is not entire trustworthy on its onw. Kraken needs to combine the auditing of they funds in fiat currencies and BTCs in order to really make a point.
@_date: 2014-03-25 11:57:40
The use of statuses such as received and processed is typical in management when two different entities work together to achieve an objective.
* request received by Kraken
this means your request to withdraw arrived at Kraken but has not been processed yet
* request processes by Kraken means that they processed your withdraw demand and forwarded it to their bank (at this point their job is  done)
* request received by their banking partner  means that the bank received the demand from Kraken but has not processed it yet
* request processed by their banking partner means that their bank completed the money transfer.
When you  talk about the 1 business day rule, it only applies from the point on when the bank received the request by Kraken.

I think these questions are pretty much irrelevant. IMS is no more than a term vaguely used to describe the relationship between different  currencies and on what a currency is pegged (dollar nowadays or metals such as gold or silver in the past). IMS is governed mainly by contracts between countries. There is no organisation managing the IMS per se. Though some organisations take part in discussions (IMF, World bank).
Therefore questions such as the approval of the IMS do not make sense! The IMS is no organisation, it is not the IMF. I would suggest you make some more research and understand the basics before asking specific questions that do not really make sense the way they are formulated. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:18:45
Neo Bee just lauched a little more than one week ago. The company is still at a very early stage and has only one branch open. Plans to expand to other countries are far fetched at this stage. I suppose the company wants to test the market in Cyprus first. The company needs first to be profitable in Cyprus, open new branches over there before even thinking about expanding abroad. It is a brick and mortar business and cannot be scalled up internationally just like that. 
By brick and mortar I mean that the company relies on physical buildings (branches) where clients can go similar to banks. Moreover it relies on a network of businesses using their hardware (machines to process bee cards). They are basically trying to build a whole new ecosystem on the island which takes time.

Same here, the past days I had no problems, but today I withdrew some BTC and transaction still does not appear in the Blockchain. This does not seem to be something new though:
                (check after 2hrs why your transaction on MtGox did not went through)
Happened apparently already. Transactions eventually got through, MtGox answered to a ticket fom another user and said that withdrawals in BTC can sometimes take 1-24hrs. 
Some people might have waited longer, but I think that at the end everyone got his money. So I do not start worrying right now.

thanks that is useful information, i hadn´t considered this possibility.

Bitcoin presence would be great for the world cup. 
Before bringing this up I want to mention that I am not a big fan of Dogecoin. But the example of dogecoin donations to the jamaican bobsleigh team was  a great idea. I watched the bobsleigh with 2 people on tv but did not hear any mention of dogecoin.  I did not however watched the bob with 4 and was wondering if the media (tv) actually reported about the donation which was around 30k usd?. 
I realize that every media channel in every country will report differently about the event. I was wondering if TV mentioned the donation during the Olympic event, or if this donation was relatively fruitless from this point of view (i am not speaking of media articles on the web, my question relates to the live national TV broadcasts of the event). 
For the ones who ask themselves why this question: Increased knowledge of how Bitcoins/Altcoins are marketed at international events would allow the community to focus on the best and more efficient marketing channels and techniques to market these currencies in the future.

The only way Mt.Gox can survive is if the company makes radical changes. 
First the CEO should resign. From here on the company would have to be managed in an exemplary fashion. 
- the whole website  would have to be updated to a real  trading platform
- withdrawals would have to be processed faster and cheaper than industry competitors
- Trading fees would have to be very competitive
Not forgetting good marketing and a miracle PR team to restore trust in the company. 
I know Mt.Gox is not public, it seems that Marc Karpeles the CEO has &gt;=51% of the shares as otherwise the other investors would most likely try to push him out of his CEO´s role to save the company.

Do not take us for fools, these carpets are probably made in china as nobody in Iran would hand weave a carpet with acrylic! 
Moreover i am not sure about the density as you do not state if it is per square inch, or square sth. But looking at the photograph the details would suggest that the density is not very high compared to quality carpets. 
Anyway i´d suggest anybody that is considering buying such a carpet makes his own research and considers the material used and  the  density (more knots per square inch means more detail, a little bit like pixels in a picture).
@_date: 2015-03-31 06:38:31
I like the idea of a bitcoin carpet. I just wanted to point out to my fellow redditors that these carpets are far too expensive considering the fabric used which is acrylic. Quality carpets are either wool or silk, silk being the most expensive ones. Moreover it is probably manufactured mechanically not as traditional Persian carpets that are manufactured by hand. Considering the price you should get a silk carpet that is manufactured by hand. Keep in mind that in Iran carpets are much cheaper than over here, so my opinion is that these guys just want to make a quick buck selling us bad quality for an exorbitant price.
