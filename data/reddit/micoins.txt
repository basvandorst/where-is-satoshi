Thanks Ross im in one of these countries so will have a look as i have a feeling i signed up on CoinCorner in the past but always stuck to Localbitcoins until a few weeks ago when my account got hacked and all my coins stolen and even with all the security and phone number which should of been text with a code they allowed it to happen without doing any security checks and they say it was me that withdrew the coins but wouldnt be trying to get my coins from them if i had withdrew them so started using Coinmama and after a few deals they failed a order and the funds have been stuck as pending in my bank and they say its the bank that has my money and the bank say its them that has the money and if they dont release it then i will never get it back and they now wont answer my e,mail to customer support so its looking like some scam they are doing so will check your recommendation and if i have already signed up then will give it a try if not i will sign up as i have heard a few good reports regarding CoinCorner.Cheers
