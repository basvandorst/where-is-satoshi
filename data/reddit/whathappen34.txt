 this used to be popular, not sure if it still is. If you decide against, maybe find an older one that doesn't store print history and something that uses toner instead of ink (won't fade over time).

Thanks, I was looking for this!

I am sorry to hear that. Does Mt. Gox have two factor authentication? If so hopefully you have it enabled so that the risk of your account being compromised is reduced. Take a deep breath, I was freaking out when Coinbase was not working in Firefox; the next day everything went back to normal. Sorry you are missing a big wave though :/ 
Edit: Not as bad in the Mt. Gox exchange, I was following the Bitstamp exchange and after days of being pretty flat it is finally making a move.

I wasn't sure why or what I wanted to read when I opened the comments...but this is it. You would figure Forbes wouldn't run such a shit title/story.

This was so good I searched my phone to see if it was real. Nice design!
@_date: 2014-02-21 00:12:02
Nice :)

I would be interested in hearing this. I have been wanting to put my coins on cold storage but paranoid I am going to have malware take it.

You are awesome. Thank you very much!

Hey Bruce! Excluding government, what barriers do you think are preventing global awareness/adoption? Is it information/lack of understanding the protocol, too new, etc.?

got screwed. He posted his work in progress and put what seems like a lot of effort into the contest.

Does it matter what you spend it on? What if you buy $600 worth of BTC, does that count? Or is it only when transferring BTC for goods and services? Thanks for the clarification. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 22:46:28
I think it is a Chinese business suit.
@_date: 2014-06-06 14:12:28
This is a good point. Libertarians/fiscal conservatives who do not believe in the Fed's quantitative easing plan may view this as a hedge against inflation.

Of course this comes out right after I made my first BTC purchase on their site. Ah well hopefully it is the beginning of many more savings opportunities to come!
@_date: 2014-06-06 14:05:30
I think people are beginning to understand the many applications the Bitcoin protocol can be used for. It's intrinsic value is starting to peek out :)

I was having an issue similar to this when trying to login to Coinbase. I tried Internet Explorer instead of Firefox and that worked. Best of luck!

Aliens have come to Earth and want to buy your house. They use Bitcoin. You are a human that does not know what Bitcoin is. The aliens have to explain it to you. Go!

You have to report anything over $600.
Edit: Apparently I was mistaken!

Great link, thanks!

Jonathan is a great presenter. Very engaging and interesting material!
@_date: 2015-04-27 01:15:12
Maybe try bitaddress.org - seems simpler.
@_date: 2015-04-27 02:49:36
Sorry, I'm a noob so can't really help much. Just wanted to mention the other site in case you had not heard of it...hope you find the answer to this!

They basically run their own blockchain on the side, and then use a factoid to hash into the bitcoin blockchain. The factoids are just an anti-spam method.
Edit: ...I think...

Well said! Good stuff to know :)

For insignificant sums of money, I like breadwallet for iPhone.

I actually prefer tipping in dollar amounts. I think it helps those with little bitcoin knowledge understand the technology better by using a value they are familiar with. They can see how it can be used as "real" money.

Great job! The link has some personally identifiable information, you may want to remove it (be careful of internet creepies!).  And thanks for being proactive for us lazy ones :) 
@_date: 2015-03-25 02:13:04
Thanks for making original content. I think the more people do stuff like this and grow the community, the better. $1 @_date: 2017-06-13 01:57:40
Respect for Pitbull. His understanding is deeper than I expected.
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:24:41
My favorite so far!
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:37:27
Love seeing the progress! This should definitely be the contest winner IMO. It shows the amount of time put into the design, and is professional-grade work.
