Exactly. Ever since the government took away the gold backing of US currency, it's been just a bubble waiting to pop.

btc is backed by drugs and other illegal stuff?

So, btc is basically just like a stock in a company. Except its only based on what someone will pay for it?
Down vote me if you wish, I just sincerely don't understand it. It seems like having our information on hard drives that could be whipped out by a solar flare. It just seems like a really fragile thing.

I just don't know how this hold any type of value. It's backed by nothing, just like paper money. I would cash out, but I'm a moron who knows nothing.

Yeah, but gold is tangible and has uses beyond it's worth in paper money, which is why paper money had value, because it was backed by a physical entity which has uses.
Now paper money only has the value of what someone will pay for it, which goes down as they continue to print more. So in that sense btc at least can't be watered down.

I guess that's where the phrase, "it takes money to make money" comes from.

I understand that there is a finite source of it. 
I'm saying that the paper money we earn and use to buy goods is essentially worth nothing. If the economy collapses, the value of the dollar would crash and wouldn't be able to buy you much of anything.
Before 1933, the only reason paper "money" had any value was because you could exchange it for gold. Since then, its essential sentimental paper that people SEE value in. It's no different than saying an old baseball card is worth $1000. Effectively, it is just a piece of paper with ink on it and it's only worth what someone would pay for it. There is only a finite amount of those cards out there, but the only value is what someone sees in that object.
While gold (or other precious metals) is also a finite resource, it's physical nature means you can use it for a variety of things.
"Just go with it man" isn't really a convincing argument.

That is hardly a coke nail.
