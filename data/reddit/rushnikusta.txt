They've all gotta go folks, we are selling these chains at RIDICULOUS prices!
@_date: 2016-03-05 07:53:10
I'm trying to work out what triggered this price drop and I think it's just the news of the block size issues doing their rounds again combined with those transactions that got stuck a couple of days ago. If that's the case it's probably going to head down further until the issues get solved edit: and then make a huge comeback with greater confidence.

[Bitcoin and Mallory](
"When I see sustained, multilateral action against systems as organic and valuable as Hawala and BitCoin, my first response is to slice up the official story and look for the lies. The second step is to look for the truth, outside the official tales. And it’s almost always about money, profit, someone’s private benefit."
"One wonders why and how Western Union was given a blank check to gobble up its competitors and create a global monopoly. One might also wonder if the heavy handed crackdowns on informal — and cheap — money transfer systems (like Hawala networks and e-gold etc) is connected to WU’s growth."
In his book “The One Percent Doctrine: Deep Inside America’s Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11,” Ron Suskind writes about a meeting between the FBI, CIA, and Western Union at CIA headquarters:




Has the CIA asked anyone in the Bitcoin community to be "patriotic"?

It's not them you need to worry about. It's the banksters and intelligence agencies they work for. I'd say the next trick is to associate bitcoin with terrorists.

Just not with the XT fork. Which is why this guy is having a cry.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:28:00
As I understand it (and maybe I'm misunderstanding the situation), he's talking about the consensus amongst developers, not nodes, and how that flows on to impact the distributed consensus model. These two developers will be able to change the distributed consensus model a lot more easily after the fork than before because there are only 2 of them not 5. Sure, if people don't like they way they change it it can fork again, but the barrier to doing that is very high. In other words, it's much easier to put these 2 developers into power than it will be to remove them, and the door to political manipulation has been opened.

Exactly. It goes against the entire concept and philosophy of bitcoin to have someone "in charge". Needing someone in charge means bitcoin has failed.
Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders, even if their name is Gavin Andresen, Barack Obama, or Satoshi Nakamoto.
@_date: 2016-02-12 01:38:52
Satoshi didn't put anyone "in charge". Read his posts carefully and understand the philosophy. If anyone needs to be "in charge" then Bitcoin has failed. And in any case, people and motivations do not stay the same - Hitler was a fantastic leader at the start, doesn't mean he should have been in charge the whole time.

I suspect they are going to be using a sidechain or a walled-garden blockchain.

They're also measurably more expensive and you're measurably more likely to have your funds frozen for 6 months.

That clique only wants to kill or control bitcoin anyway. Thanks Gavin, maybe you can join Mike at R3.

Does he have any idea what's happening? Like if they are doing something with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-12 04:46:39
I'm just saying that even if Satoshi did put him in charge (he absolutely did not), that doesn't mean anything. People change. Circumstances change. His motives are very clear to me.

IMHO China is responsible. A subset of a subset in China just got a sniff of Bitcoin and that's all it takes. For the last 6 months, all my speculations about what Bitcoin is going to do has been based on what's happening in China coupled with the assumption that Mike etc are working for the banks and intelligence agencies who want to kill (or control) Bitcoin. I've been right basically every time and I've been clearing 4% growth per week (basically doubled my money in 6 months while the price has only increased 35-40%). I think she's going to grow moderately this year as they start linking Bitcoin to terrorism funding but at the same time the number of unstable economies is increasing, I'm guessing $1000 will be quite normal by the end of the year. Longer term is really hard to predict, it really depends on what governments and banks come up with to kill it, I think they expected the whole Mike thing to work a *lot* better than it did.

Why would I care what random people on the street think of bitcoin...? That's like going out and asking 10 people how old the earth is. It doesn't matter how they answer, the earth's age doesn't change to match their average opinions.

The media is owned by the same J's that own the banks, their job is to kill bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-09 02:57:28
What are you actually talking about....? By your logic, nothing (and I mean absolutely nothing) can ever be a success. If you asked random people on the street what they thought about credit cards when they were first created you'd get the same response. Same for the automobile. Same for electricity. Same for literally everything. The average person on the street has no idea what bitcoin is yet. I suspect you don't either, or perhaps you have a short position. The only opinions I care about are people who have actually used it, not random strangers who've never even heard of it before.

I dunno guys, Huobi is dropping like a rock right now. Maybe it will head back up again, or maybe it was speculators and they're starting to drop out.
@_date: 2015-10-27 01:12:01
I was thinking it was a pump and dump but as someone who's lived in China for a decade and is somewhat in tune with what's happening in society in general I'm leaning towards people screaming "oh f*ck the monetary controls are coming and realestate is about to pop" for the last 30 days, combined with the fact it's a MASSIVE country and it only takes like 0.0000000000000000000000001% (edit: or whatever) of the population to choose bitcoin as an option for something like this to happen.

Not only to fund their wars, but to scrape as much as possible from society at all times. There are people inside the system (slaves) and people outside of the system (people who can print money, let's call them Je... Bankers). The funny thing is the slaves will fight tooth and nail to protect the system. (edit: spelling)

I'm not much of an analyst, I'm just looking at it on the ground and I think it's simply a numbers game. If Bitcoin doesn't disappear, they'll adopt it, at first just as a way to get money out of the country (it's basically a dream come true for that). That of course will just be an intermediary between RMB and some other asset but I think it will drive actual adoption rates up, especially as other countries start seizing assets and deporting 'tax evaders' etc back to China. Not to mention the fact that Chinese don't really trust banks, the first thing they'll tell you when withdrawing money from an ATM in China is to check if the notes are real. IMHO it's a f*cking powder keg ready to blow. Then again, bitcoin could also go to zero.
@_date: 2015-10-28 02:08:00
It's 9am in *China* and *Huobi* is already hitting $300.
@_date: 2015-10-28 01:53:49
The mom and pop ones are worse, but HSBC, China Merchants, and even Bank of China all have fake notes.... I personally got fake notes from an HSBC ATM just last week.
@_date: 2015-10-28 23:48:59
In the free market in HK where there are hundreds of little mom and pop currency exchange places they all change USD and RMB at very close to the official value, not even close to this amount of difference. There are also black market traders in Shenzhen, same story. So even if you sell your coins on Huobi for RMB and then convert it on the black market to USD you're going to end up with closer to $311 than $302. In any case the point of the discussion was about Huobi, everyone knows it's always about $10 higher than every other exchange, whether it's because of currency issues or something else, that's not the point. What's interesting is the divergence between the normal discrepancy and the discrepancy when volume hits the exchange, unless you think the 'real world' RMB/USD rates are reflected in the Huobi exchange and no other factors.
@_date: 2015-10-27 04:13:33
I wouldn't buy now either because I don't think it's going to go past 320 (before going down first anyway). I'm claiming 2 things: I don't think this rise is a pump and dump, I think it's Chinese entering the market and building a solid base. And if bitcoin doesn't go to 0 the Chinese middle class will start adopting it over the next 2 years (and anyone who hasn't lived in China for at least a few years won't be able to grasp what that really means).
@_date: 2015-10-28 01:55:15
No one knows for sure what's going to happen to bitcoin, if everyone knew there wouldn't be a discussion.
@_date: 2015-10-27 05:46:25
I know all about the 1% fallacy, you may have missed context of my comment. I'm using a 1% example because I'm replying to a comment that was asking specifically about a 1% adoption rate. My point is *not* that "if only 1% of X then Y will happen" (that's why there's more text below that line), my point is that widespread adoption in China (more than 1%) is *not necessary* for China to have a *huge* impact on bitcoin and there's a plethora of precedent for this - *every time* a small subset of a subset in China get some kind of idea about something there are massive consequences for all involved. I think (and of course I could be wrong) that this recent rise over the last month might not be a pump and dump but actually legitimate demand in China, everything else is just to illustrate that point.

@_date: 2015-10-27 02:07:35
Yes but those are literally the kind of numbers we're talking about if there's an influx, and that's only 1% of the middle class putting *some* of their money into a safe and untouchable spot.
@_date: 2015-10-27 06:03:59
I'm maybe noticing a trend in case anyone is interested, the price seems to drop at 12 and come back at 2, coinciding with when most of China is asleep or eating lunch.
@_date: 2015-10-27 01:43:06
Even if only 1% of the middle class chose bitcoin as a safe haven I imagine it would skyrocket (5 million people dropping in ~$100k each). We're talking about people who go to Hong Kong for the weekend and spend $10k on handbags because they know they're not fake.
What I'm saying is, China's middle class (who have just as much or even more disposable income as their US and EU counterparts) is half a billion people. That's why when Chinese get interested in something they have a huge impact, even when it's only a slim minority. For example, after the Fukushima incident in Japan there was no salt left anywhere in the country, the shelves were empty and the stockpiles at the mines disappeared overnight, because a *tiny* percentage of the Chinese middle class (mostly middle aged housewives) thought the iodine in salt would protect them from radiation blowing across from Japan. That's the kind of power I'm talking about, and with bitcoin they are only just starting to scratch the surface in a tiny way. So a pump and dump isn't necessary to explain the rise in demand, the rise in demand can simply be summed up as "Chinese early adopters". That's my take on it anyway.

It's the RMB equivalent of US$300...do you have a point? No one was saying the *bitcoin* price was hitting $300 (even though it is now), we were saying the *Huobi* price was hitting $300... We're discussing the Chinese market, not the US market.
