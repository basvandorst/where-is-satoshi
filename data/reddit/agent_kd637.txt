....or the prices will be back up by NYE.

Ah I see, hmm. Think I will just sell 50% and hold the rest. Who knows.

LTC is climbing though?

Do you think Bcash and banking shills are really operating on this sub (quick look at the new threads) in order to discredit BTC, or is it unfounded paranoia?

I'm keen to read it if you inbox it to me :)

This. I want to test the outcome such conditions might have on a system, using the "simulated game" setting in cognitive-behavioral psychology. Apparently areas of Russian have something similar, but not on the Blockchain (yet).

It might be the biggest centralized and "institutional" coin out of Asia. I prefer Stellar Lumens.

You are going to get an caps (anarcho-capitalists) telling you one thing (no external or subsidised help, you're on your own etc) and anarcho-socialists telling you another (Blockchain/crypto could be used for creating a form of universal basic income, streamline true democratic participation, reduce healthcare costs etc.).

If I am anticipating a dip after/on the 17th following the launch of CME futures, would it be a good idea to trade in my (small investment) of BTC for an altcoin beforehand and watch and see?

Please ELI5:
* Why are smart contracts possible only with Ethereum and not Bitcoin?
* In what possible ways can proof of stake be better than proof of work?

Would the rolling out of the lightning network make Litecoin absolete? Currently invested in BTC only but I'm considering diversifying with Litecoin.

I use Poloniex, works fine
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:54:50
I'm going to invest a couple hundred dollars of my wages in BTC every month, using dollar cost averaging and HODL. I am using Poloniex as an exchange since GDAX/Coinbase aren't available to me as a non-US citizen. I hear personal wallets like electrum are more secure, in case the exchanges get hacked or go offline, but 1) is it worth going this route  if I am just investing a few hundred dollars a month, 2) is electrum easy to use/operate, 2) are there significant fees to transfer between my wallet and an exchange in case I grow bold and want to use some of my BTC profits to buy alts? 
Suggestions for alternatives to electrum are welcome. Thanks!

Marxist socialism: class consciousness among the working class will increase, from the embers of an industrious but unfair capitalism, socialism will rise.
Communism: vanguard party/dictatorship of the proletariat must rule because the working class has not "yet" reached class consciousness. Ruralism can be converted to socialism without the need for substantial existing industry.

You asked, I obliged. No need to be a sarcastic dick pump.
