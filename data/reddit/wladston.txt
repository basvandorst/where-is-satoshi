Leandro is still a partner and the owner of Mercado. I was a client that suffered from the hack (indirectly) and I wasn't paid back. He only paid back the direct users from the Market. Affected third parties (us) were left out.
At the rate he is paying, it will take over 2 years. And he is paying the coins at the frozen rate of about $80 per coin. It's just too unfair.
@_date: 2014-01-11 17:41:54
That's just not true. Money from many people that was lost during the event on MercadoBitcoin were not paid back. See

Would be nice if it supported Firstbits.

I still waiting Leandro from Bitcoinrain to pay me! [2]
@_date: 2014-01-11 03:03:22
It's not hate. What happened to Bitcoinrain since MercadoBitcoin was hacked was real. We just want proper explanations of what really happened and our coins back.
@_date: 2014-01-11 00:20:38
I just wished that the Mercado's operator, Leandro, payed all his debts created the last time his market got hacked in a very controversial manner, before buying expensive machinery.

I disagree completely. A large part of the community believes max block size should be set by the market, not centrally determined. And the market wants bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:03:18
yup! As long as your phone is free of malware, it's secure.

They retired the bots here because of large fees to transact with small amounts. They still have a bot on The bot is banned here though.

Bitcoin.com is one of the most notable Bitcoin websites, according to Alexa. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:43:13
If oi don’t own your private keys, you don’t own your coins. Use the BTC.com wallet for Android :) 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:36:37
Oh, so now Coinbase (or any other exchange) will allow you to withdraw BTC for 5 satoshi per byte? Last time I checked that was far from true.  Anyways, if that’s the case I’m sorry.
@_date: 2015-08-30 22:34:09
What exactly do you need? We can get examples of Bitcoin in running text almost anywhere, I think… Just give me examples of what you need and I'll try to help Googling some. Now that we've got Bitcoin listed in the Oxford Dictionary, I think it shouldn't be hard to get it into Unicode.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:59:31
Not your private keys, not your bitcoins.

I was sure I’d see at least one meme with eleven from “Stranger Things”, but nope, none. What a disappointment...

Big blockers aren't against new L2 technology. They just believe that current technology is more than ready for handling over 1MB blocks. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:56:38
Short answer: you can’t.
Long answer: It would cost you more than a dollar of transaction fees to get a dollar worth of BTC. And then that dust would be unspendable, because it would cost over a dollar in fees to transfer it somewhere else.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:35:22
Coins from the genesis block are unspendable. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:14:31
Die hard small blockers won this battle. But the war is far from over. The only difference is that now it will be more polarized than ever…
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:45:02
Problem is, you need a fan for the ASICs inside not become toast. And these fans are *reeeeeeally* noisy... 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:07:35
At this point, it seems to me the community is split beyond repair between big blockers and small blockers. I'm on the big blocker's side. The demise of 2x now polarizes this split even more.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:19:35
I'm so happy that I didn't need to make that mistake in order to learn the ultimate lesson: *Signaling means nothing.* I feel super sorry for the dude though… from his post he really believed signaling could be trusted.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:40:47
Of course! Because with crypto one can pay less in transaction fees and there is less risk for the merchant. And crypto is sound money that cannot be overinflated.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:03:59
Yes, that's the problem. Mining with GPUs produce a LOT of noise which is really annoying.

I started to work on this project in december 2011, and launched it a week after Rugatu made its first beta announcement. Anyways, Rugatu is about a QA community, and my project is more oriented towards creating an information market. I don't even feel they are competing with us. 
@_date: 2012-09-06 13:09:37
The model is not about getting what is left from SE and other free QA sites, the model is to do something different. When you are paying cash for something, the interaction is different. For example, a musician might play an instrument to you for free in the street, out of pleasure. But if you give the guy a nice tip, he'll probably try to excel.
We think a virtual cash reward might motivate people more than a virtual badge. We expect to bring a different type of community. I have many friends who are experts in many fields, but none of then reply others questions on free QA sites. When I explained Bitquestion, they were interested and willing to answer questions.
With Bitcoins, I belive there is a way to bring people to help each other, in a more efficient way than free QA. That's why I'm investing so much time and money in this idea.
@_date: 2012-09-05 23:54:07
Promote ? What exactly can I do to promote it ? I even made a print ad on Bitcoin Magazine, that seemed to make no difference.
Split the money to several answerers is on our todo list, we'll implement that, it should be easy.
If there are no good answers, the question will just sit there forever. You could email me and I'll manually cancel the question. We have plans to let users cancel questions too. The tricky part is to keep the game fair for the repliers.
Our strategy is to maximize traffic and number of questions. Once a question is posted, it usually gets answered. The thing is we have almost no questions...
@_date: 2012-06-07 17:51:08
 thanks :)
 Tonrific : it was our first question registered to the system. It's a *very hard* question. In the future we'll implement donating funds to open questions, so maybe if one day the bounty gets too high, someone will show up and give the world this information.
@_date: 2012-09-06 19:17:53
O.o Can you access via IP ? 108.166.79.80
I try to talk your network administrator out of blocking the site haha
@_date: 2012-09-06 16:03:26
The thing is, there is no mechanism to ensure that the question's bounty will really be delivered and in a fair fashion. At Bitquestion, that's one of our main concerns.
@_date: 2012-06-20 23:41:45
eldentyrell wow, your post was really good. That's exactly what we are trying to do. Right now we have a tag based subscription option -- you can follow tags on the system and it will notify you about new questions with that tag. We are going to expand this to include topic and search at some point.
We're working hard here to build this system you envision, with is the same we also envision. 
@_date: 2012-09-06 12:53:55
We thought about offering a free 0.01 BTC question for starters. But we couldn't find a way to avoid people from trying to hack the site and creating a script to ask and reply questions automatically and profit. We're thinking about giving a free question once the user links his facebook or google account.
In the future we will probably have to set a time limit. But now the site is soo low traffic that it doesn't make sense...
@_date: 2012-09-06 00:05:06
Enmaku, I appreciate and respect your opinion. I disagree with you because I have already tried those sites with some "harder" questions, and got frustrated.
Sometimes, people just don't know how/want/can help you for free. I've interviewed many people, and most people I talked to also had the same experience of trying to obtain help online without success. 
There is the super cool site uclue.com with also has a lot of traffic and works based on paid questions, the only difference is that you can't reply people's questions to get money. So I thought -- well, that might work better with Bitcoins, in an environment that everyone can ask and answer -- and that's why we made Bitquestion.
@_date: 2012-09-05 23:54:19
Thanks man :)
@_date: 2012-09-05 23:58:20
I believe we have to reach a critical mass (as in Network Effect), so people would be able to get a reply in our service faster and easier then in other free sites. We're doing the best we can to move towards that critical mass.
@_date: 2012-09-05 00:11:02
 joelthelion, thanks :) We're working on it to make it even better. If you have any feature requests, please drop me a line!
@_date: 2012-09-06 16:09:48
That's a very feasible idea. I'll try to make a page with the next 50 questions for free, 0.03 BTC bounty (we don't support mBTC, as 999 mBTC are less than a dime now). Thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2015-09-08 15:58:22
as of now, r/BitcoinMining, r/BitcoinMarkets and r/BitcoinXT are the other large subs.
@_date: 2015-09-09 04:38:28
I understood now that your motivation wasn't to state LN works in a similar way a write cache layer works, but to explain what a write-cache layer is to someone without a CS background.
A write operation would be to record a new transaction that has a given hash, so a read operation would be to retrieve a transaction with that given hash. In this sense, with LN we would get eventual consistency with read/write operations. With a formal write cache in the other hand, full consistency is achieved.

It's sad we can't even have a fixed place to host the damn thing in such a huge city haha

A lot of people are talking about 3rd party email providers. Email is decentralized, you don't need a third party company to have it. You can just setup your MX records and a mail server application properly, then, boom, you can send email for free.
@_date: 2015-09-09 02:32:49
Totally agree. A write cache layer is a temporary store of data to be written to the permanent store, not a intermediary layer for processing data.
As I understand, what would most closely resemble a write cache layer in Bitcoin is the mempool.
The part where the author says people would need CS background to understand his reasoning was indeed somehow upsetting to read.
@_date: 2015-09-04 21:55:39


guess why? Ethereum has no block size limit in Mb for starters.
@_date: 2015-09-13 02:00:23
I can't see why a user would want to use the bullet point two, but if adding this raises the overall support for an eventual bigblock fork, then I support it too!
@_date: 2015-09-08 13:42:43
BIP100 only exists in theory, it's not implemented. BIP100 support doesn't mean much in practice, because no miner is actually running BIP100–it doesn't exist in code yet.
@_date: 2015-09-09 01:28:18
Thanks for the reference, I'll read it, so I can have a better opinion about it.
@_date: 2015-09-10 04:37:35
If that really happens it's going to be super messy, but fun to watch. All the greedy miners dying with their useless hardware :)
@_date: 2015-09-08 15:55:10
It's happening. Let's see how long it takes for 90% of people to leave.
@_date: 2015-09-10 05:01:57
Really? I heard they shut down: 
@_date: 2015-09-08 15:50:24
Well, if some things doesn't change, I seriously doubt it will remain this way.
@_date: 2015-09-08 13:37:47
Indeed. I challenge people that say democracy is bad to name a better alternative. The best solution to a given problem can only be a good solution.
I really admire Switzerland's direct democracy model. If we had direct democracy in Brazil, I'm sure we would have a lot less injustice and corruption. Of course people that currently hold the power in Brazil will never allow this to happen, as they derive their power from the status quo.
In other words, it's really hard to change a system, even if it's for the better, when people that have the executive power do not benefit from the change.
