I think it depends on the psychological make-up of holders of BTC when it happens. I think that until 2017 most BTC holders had a very (decades+) long view on it and had no desire to sell, at any price - which kept supply low and resulted in the very high prices we saw a month ago. I'd also wager that back then most BTC holders would be interested in technology (in general) which implies, to an extent, that they already are of comfortable means (following technology trends is a very expensive hobby otherwise...) and less likely to be severely negatively impacted by a recession (i.e. wouldn't sell their coins).
But I'd wager the massive gains we saw in 2017 saw more short-term holders involved who are more likely to sell, not just to limit losses - but because they might not be as well-off as I imagine the typical pre-2017 BTC holder was - so the pressure to have liquidity during a recession is higher.
It's unpredictable because we don't have the data that breaks-down the financial situations of the people holding BTC at present. BTC will only crash if supply and demand say so - but what we've seen over the past year is that any downward trend is quickly corrected because there's still plenty of people who have long-term views on BTC and will buy the dip.

Correct. They're all sitting there, undisturbed, in wallets dating back to the beginning.

Because the coins have still never left those wallets - given the current ATHs it'd be crazy not to diversify at least a slither of his holdings into other sources. Either Satoshi is acting irrationally, is a time-traveller from the far future, or has lost the keys to those addresses.
...or he's a super-HODLer.

Problem is fungible assets are not... entirely fungible. Bitcoin's market-cap can hypothetically exceed global wealth if a significant chunk of BTC is inaccessible or non-fungible (e.g. lost private keys).

"Nearly instant" and "low fee" are relative terms. Domestically in the US moving money around is expensive (Same-day "Wire" transactions cost me $20) or slow (Free ACH transactions take 2-3 days to appear and theoretically weeks to fully "clear") - compared to that, Bitcoin is a godsend.
In the US, services like PayPal, SquareCash, Venmo, etc all run on-top of the ACH and/or Debit card networks - while you can "send" money by PayPal instantly, it still takes 2-3 days for the recipient to get their PayPal money back into their actual bank account - with the ever-present risk of a PayPal account freeze.
Other countries, like most of the EU, the UK, etc already have free, instant interbank personal payments systems (e.g. "FasterPayments") meaning that PayPal and to an extent, Bitcoin, is unnecessary - except for international payments where you're at the mercy of Western Union, currency exchange commission fees, and profit-margins embedded in exchange rates - and international transactions are invariably slow too (sending money from the US to the UK using Xoom takes me about 1-2 hours, but still 3-4 days the other way thanks to the US' slooooow domestic ACH network).
Some good news: the "Zelle" network in the US is a new interbank network that allows for free and instant transfers - except you can only use it for "personal" payments and not for any commercial reasons, which limits its utility overall, but still gives Bitcoin an edge in commercial transactions.

Given Bitcoin is only pseudonymous, isn't Monero used for illegal transactions though? The online drugs market is large, but certainly not big enough to justify BTC's $200bn "market cap" (I hate the concept too, but it's the least worst way to describe it).
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:13:17
Not all alt-coins are Bitcoin clones. Many are valuable in their own right for different reasons, like Ethereum (a distributed computing system, the "smart contracts") and Litecoin which serves as a playground for new ideas that would hopefully be eventually applied to Bitcoin (e.g. both Segwit and the Lightning Network were trialled in LTC first before BTC got them).
If IPFS takes off then they'll need their own coin because BTC is "proof-of-work" but a distributed filesystem needs "proof-of-space" for which BTC is inappropriate and a new coin is needed (hence Filecoin).
The ICOs you see launched should be thought more as paper shares in companies traded between private individuals (hence all the Ponzi scams) - but it makes sense for each org to have their own ICO instead of basing theirs on another company's ICO (because then the value of their own ICO is tied to their own success (or hype...), not another's.
The rest, like Trumpcoin, BCash, and so on don't really serve much purpose that BTC doesn't already provide. Some of them might experiment around, sure, but you should look to see how organised and serious a coin's development team and backers are before either dismissing them or buying into them, and always think critically!

This is the worst point because it's false. There is a "plan" for BTC but it's more like a vision-statement: it's the foundation for the new economy. It will be valuable as a utility as a new medium of exchange that obviates  the need for middlemen like SWIFT, Western Union, Visa and Mastercard, and so on.

I want to know exactly was being "sold" in exchange for $25k - was the fraudster selling him a mining rig or ASIC hardware - or selling him bitcoin in a really dumb way - as-in "pay me $25 and I'll send your bitcoins in the mail"?

A friend of mine is a casual day-trader who also day-trades BTC. He was so sure of a crash as soon as it hit $10k due to the sell-wall that he liquidated his entire BTC holdings (into six-figures USD) around $9700. Then it hit $11,290.
He also told me to sell of my ETH on the 20th November because he felt it was due for a correction - he sold all of his ETH too (about $40,000 worth) - if he held then it would be worth $53,000 now.
He goes to Vegas about six times a year and won $20,000 at slots once, too.

Coins are not regulated securities, I don't believe the SEC has jurisdiction here - and Coinbase Inc. isn't even a publicly traded company - so insider trading and wilful manipulation of the price of BCH is entirely lawful - even if it is a huge dick-move.
That said, I believe everyone forsaw the price of BCH would skyrocket when it launched on Coinbase - I was watching the feed live on GDAX when it happened just out of anticipation for a shit-show. My only regret is not getting my Sell order in on-time before the BCH trading-fuse popped.

It is not physically possible with a classical computer to brute-force a Bitcoin private-key as the key length is 256 bits: 
Quantum computing algorithms exist that significantly reduce the runtime (to a Sqrt with Grover's Algorithm; while I don't know about Shor's algorithm but from my limited understanding it isn't going to reduce it to polynomial-time).
@_date: 2018-03-23 06:41:18
It's not that we put our life-savings into this - it's that we casually mined for a few weeks or bought some BTC with disposable income in the very early years - and suddenly we realise we have more value in BTC than we'd like to - which puts us in a difficult situation of not wanting to sell - or buy.

GitHub wasn’t launched until 2008 and Git (released in 2005) was not fully embraced by the developer community until around 2010-2011 because the concepts involved in distributed source-control were difficult to internalise after everyone got comfortable with SVN (and as bad as SVN in, remember CVS (which it replaced) was much, much worse).

But bitcoin was so worthless back then that you had to spend 10,000 BTC to buy a pizza!
...so spending a few hours CPU-mining to get a few dozen coin doesn’t seem that impressive, but that’s the idea: BTC’s value came from the cost of mining those coins: a few hours of intense CPU activity on a workstation-class machine would probably cost $0.05 in electricity - so 1 BTC == $0.05.

To an extent, systems like OCSP and Certificate Transparency already provide the *functionality* of this proposed D-PKI, except using a variety of protocols and means of transmission. D-PKI seems like a movement to bring it under one roof - I laud it, but I'm hesitant to call it any kind of revolution in PKI, especially when many parties have legitimate needs to maintain secrets in a PKI system, such as not disclosing certificates for internal hostnames, or maintaining their own revocation system because they operate their own separate trust system.

Assuming he mined for all of 2011 and assuming 2.5BTC/day (as the difficulty didn't change much from 2011 until 2013) then that's at least 912 BTC - now worth $5.5m USD. If he mined consistently from 2011 until GPU mining stopped being viable in 2014, then a conservative lower-bound on his BTC balance is around 3,000 BTC - or $16.5m+ today.

Isn't that using Deterministic Wallets though? And it means that given any previous address someone can calculate what your next wallet addresses will be?
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:00:16
This could be done with non-cached, zero-TTL, DNS record - provided you have a trusted DNS server that you can keep online - it would serve a new address each time a new request is made. I don't know how well that would work with DNSSEC though, unless it was delegated to a new sub-zone that was re-signed on every generation - which might limit scalability.
I'd much prefer an email-based system (send a specially-crafted e-mail message to someone's "bitcoin e-mail address") where a two-way exchange happens and the funds-originator gets a newly-created destination address sent to them by email, and the funds-recipient gets the sender's email address - which can help accountability in cases where it's needed.

A workaround is using disposable, single-use addresses for each transaction. A street-vendor could have a sign with a QR code or web URL that goes to a web-page that generates a single-use address - and provided the funds are never funneled back into a single address then there's no way to tie them together until they're passed on to another individual.

I take exception to this. I accept it's the logical conclusion of things being "law" - but the fact is that you will *not* be threatened with a gun by anyone for not having the right kind of FCC license for your HAM radio or for bittorrenting a Hannah Montana CD. In fact I believe it would be illegal (ironically) for the police or civil agencies to escalate a situation like that anyway.

They can do it, sure - it just isn't economically viable at all.
Say you have a $500 graphics card, that when running at full-load 24/7 consumes $50 of electricity in a month. For that effort you'll be rewarded with $25 of Bitcoin at current prices. Thus you effectively bought $25 of Bitcoin for $50 ($550 if you include the cost of the GPU). That's equivalent to paying $9000/BTC today as the price is currently $4500. It's senseless. You'll only get an ROI if you can sell the BTC you made for $50 or more - i.e. when the price reaches $9000/BTC.
This is because of Bitcoin's difficulty factor: as faster mining hardware is used and becomes more prevalent it gets more expensive (computationally) to mine new blocks.
Mining is only profitable if you can mine blocks (or share, in a pool) at a cos of electricity consumption less than buying coins on the open market - otherwise you're gambling on the price increasing so you eventually make a profit.
Right now I'm mining ETH at home at a cost of $50/mo in electricity but I generate about 0.7ETH/mo ($150 USD equivalent) - giving me an effective monthly profit of $100 (which technically isn't a profit yet as I need to recuperate the cost of the mining hardware too).
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:59:28

If you buy now and then move it from an exchange to the blockchain then you'll have the coins *and* the alt-coins after the forks - then we can liquidate before they lose too much value. I reckon the price-jump is because people want to buy-in before the forks happen - not to mention the purchase-delay on exchanges like Coinbase.
I'm fully expecting a crash or correction back to the 4000s within a few weeks too, but if I buy then it may be too late to get the "free" forked coins.

Only if the business is looking for the long term. If someone's looking for a quick gain and it's in their short-term interests to screw people over then it's going to happen. Look at Trump University or multi-level marketing schemes (even when there's a real product to sell).
