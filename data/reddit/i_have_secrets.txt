Tried to scan it, didn't work...obviously. Wish I was there to take one of these cards. Probably never going to get the chance to own bitcoins.

What? I thought you could only do this with those who already had bitcoins?! Damn the future is scary cool. Thanks I officially own 1.27mB.

Is it just me who can't help but cringe when an individual with a start up business declares themselves as CEO or Managing Director?
EDIT - Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love start up companies and the ambitious nature individuals have to risk all in trying to make it on their own. I feel that the title shouldn't be a factor unless it has to be in a more "corporate"(yuk) setting.

Was thinking about making the most of this bad situation and buying some, but I agree it is not as low as I imagined it would fall.

Yeah, just romanticising the point really. Who knows. Nobody cares.

I don't think it's terrible, but to say "I have my own business", "I am the owner", "I am the sole proprietor" or something along those lines makes it so much more admirable, I have so much respect for those who are admittedly doing things on their own or within a small business. To say you are a CEO to me, gives the misconception that you are trying to make your company appear larger than it actually is.

I guess, I would just feel a little out of character to call myself a CEO for my little florist business or something. Anyway, no harm either way. Good luck in all your ventures.

Yes. Totally agree. This is a learning curve for so many. DPR made some very stupid mistakes. He believed he was untouchable but at the same time left the biggest breadcrumb trail you could imagine. Others who are smarter, will learn and create other markets.
