My response is short, and doesn’t give  any credit for your statement and thoughts I apologise for that. It is a good angle. 
My response, 
I agree with the thought about people will hold onto appreciating assets and won’t spend it, this is always the point of other crypto’s purpose, and the idea that bitcoin will act like gold in the future is a valid one. Also limited supply does play a purpose in the growth of what bitcoin. Will be. 
But what will change the game is the ability to earn bitcoins in stbitcoinsandard workplaces or small business, when one earns bitcoin and pays taxes. This will change the dynamic of the coin entirely. When you have expenses and income that can be offset in a trusted fast reliable way one will find the ease of spending as one earns it. 
Additionally one will spend bitcoin if there are advantages too, constantly exchanging to either fiat or something with less appreciation potential will become  a hassle and encourage direct spending amongst peers. 
This is how I hope the future of bitcoin to become, I have just set up BitPay in my busienss and spend bitcoin where I can to improve circulation, I hope everyone does the same, the benefits to the world will be amazing.

You may not fully understand financial services and bitcoin enough to forecast the dynamics st play in the future, strongly disagree.

Very well said sir. 
those who care only of price, or who views this as an “investment” miss the point of bitcoin completely. At the end of the day bitcoin offers a futures of a fair world and that’s worth much more than a price. 
In terms of value perception I think it’s similar to gold, it’s not about the price going up, it’s about the fiat system going down/debased.

Long read but amazing insight

Disagree, I think the goal is adoption not price gain, I would prefer price stability stay at it’s value and everyone uses it, than price to go up and harder for other people to adopt.

So your suggestion is just to follow suit? Keep your USD because the government might put an executive order order in and lock everyone up? Have some courage my friend. 
What happens if there was enough people who said no? What happens if they couldn’t lock everyone up? What happens if there was a revolution At that time? All because of BTC. Wouldn’t that be nice? Then people would be freed of these executive orders, and I think that’s one of the main benefits of BTC, power to the people. At least try, better than following suit on an archaic system, don’t you think?
