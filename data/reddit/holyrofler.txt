Sorry - those weren't supposed to be reasons why I think it's a ponzi scheme.  Those were just other negative things that I threw out about BTC.  It's treated as a ponzi scheme by many early investors.


If/when BTC is widely adopted by nation states, then this will no longer be true.  Until it does, people investing now are only paying early investors for snake oil backed by a lot of hype.

Excellent argument.
@_date: 2016-04-03 08:33:16
It exists but it isn't what the hype makes it out to be.  Just three years ago, people were selling miners for thousands of dollars which never payed for themselves.  People investing in BTC right now are being ripped off and sold snake oil.  There is nothing there but hype.  Volatility still exists in 2016 but ppl keep speculating.
If I sell you a bag of dog shit and say that it's the latest craze and that I can increase your investment 10 fold, I'm not selling you a bag of dog shit, I'm selling you false hype.

It is still a ponzi.  The price is hyper inflated.  Service fees are outrageous.  You can spend it virtually nowhere.  BTC has a long way to go before its viable for everyone.

I don't get it.  Why would the Australian authorities care who created Bitcoin?  Is BTC a crime in Australia or something?  If so, why would Gizmodo and WIRED try to dox the person?
@_date: 2015-12-09 12:33:18
Do you know of any books that describe the history of BTC from beginning to present and do it well?  I'm fairly new to BTC and have been loosely watching it since it became known in the tech / maker community fiver years ago or so.  I still don't understand a great deal.
@_date: 2015-12-20 12:25:56
As a community, I think everyone is doing a poor job of protecting the qualities of bitcoin.  Patents are a serious problem in the U.S. and in 10 years, the patents that are being placed now will rule the day in what can and can't be built.
Honestly, I can't get serious about bitcoin because I don't feel like the community is serious about bitcoin.  Everyone just seems to be speculating and trading - innovation is only coming from a few and NOBODY is countering banks from coming in and ruining everything great about it (which has already been happening for at least two years now).

Please go to the principal about it - that kind of behavior shouldn't be tolerated.  You kid's scores should be graded fairly.  If the principal doesn't take action, then go to the school board.
This isn't about Bitcoin, but about ethics and fairness in the school system.

@_date: 2015-05-01 21:29:02
Why isn't BTC licensed under GPL?  If it were GPL, then any related tech that uses the blockchain would also have to be licensed under GPL.  Too bad it was created under an MIT license - this may prove the bane of BTC in the long term.

This wasn't a complaint - it was a comparison of the pros and cons of BTC exchanges.  Before you can come up with a solution, you have to identify the problem.  I'm not educated enough to solve the problem yet - we'll see where the future takes me.

@_date: 2015-09-22 09:23:32
I really don't get the point of exchanges.  They charge fees, aren't secure and seem to be the antithesis of what is good about bitcoin.  I'm a noob though, so maybe I'm missing something.
@_date: 2015-09-24 04:39:08
No source needed - it's common sense.  As you said, it has happened before - not too long ago.
Coinbase does stand to lose, but I wouldn't say they'd lose more than anyone else.  When your 10k USD worth of BTC is suddenly worth 100 USD overnight - that's quite a loss.
@_date: 2015-09-18 06:07:50

You seem pretty confident.  If fiat crashes, then utilities go down.  Then networks go down.  How will bitcoin be used in a country that has no internet?

BTC is a currency - everyone holding it is trying to make money.  This is why we all watch the market to see the current value.  We want to buy when it's low and sell when it's high so we can reinvest in more BTC.  It's no different than people who exchange other currencies for profit.


I don't disagree with that, but the next time there's another Mt. Gox, I guarantee you the price will plummet overnight.  Set a reminder.
Simply not true.

@_date: 2015-09-24 04:04:57
I didn't know that watching exchanges destroy Bitcoin was going to be part of that experiment.  Serious - have we no better ideas other than exchanges?
Pros: Convenient way to exchange BTC.
Cons: Susceptible to unreasonable and unregulated fees, insecure, susceptible to fraud, potential to crash the entire market and now we have exchanges trying to claim BTC as their own IP.
@_date: 2015-09-24 15:24:42
I think there's a solution - there must be a way to cut out the middle man and accomplish the same task.  The more I think about it, the more I think it's possible.  Got to get back to class, though - no more time to think about it.

I thought we didn't know who created Bitcoin?  So people took the source code and are updating it?  Doesn't that mean that the entire economy that surrounds Bitcoin has an Achilles heel - the developers who've taken control of the project?  I'm just curious about this as I'm new to Bitcoin and still figuring it all out.
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:13:29
Whether or not it's a livable wage in your country - it certainly is not in the United States.  These are near poverty wages.  ~30% of that will go to state taxes, federal taxes and social security.  Then he'll have to pay for automotive and health insurance on his own.  He'll have to pay for automotive inspections, automotive tags, licensing fees, property taxes and automotive taxes.
Whatever is left will go to food, health care deductibles, medication, medical co-pays, automotive repair, electricity bills, water bills, gas bills, internet bills, rent and let's not forget sales tax.  $25,000 simply can't cover all of those things.

. . .  and I believe.  Technology isn't a religion and if you treat it as such, you will get burned.  If you're interested in BTC because of a sales pitch, then you probably aren't playing it smart.
That said, this was probably a figure of speech - hope so.
