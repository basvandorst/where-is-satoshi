I had a roommate adopt a dog about 10 and some years ago and he named it ROFL MAO.  Great dog.  Dumb as a bag of rocks, but such a good boy.

an addendum to this: ACH withdrawals from GDAX are processed in about 24 hours, compared to the week that they take from the regular site.

Ditto, was supposed to cash out my nicehash wallet (just been mining against my laptop gpu) for this weekend, and now ... nope.  Fortunately, I have two other wallets with a little mined eth from my simplemining rig.  I'm still building it as money from the day job trickles in, so it's hardly a faucet, but every little bit, I guess.

BWAHAHAHAHA!!! At a former employer, the employees were encouraged to use the recall function in outlook by the legal department in certain events.  After I found out about this, I explained that that function only worked on your own organization, and not over the Internet.  *They didn't believe me* (the guy running the Exchange infrastructure) and then after I quit, was asked to come back as a contractor for something or other, said legal department sent a rather defamatory email in response to my invoice.
Then he tried to recall it.
Oh I had so much fun with that.  I only wish I had my current lawyer at the time.

How much did you have saved in fiat?  I mean, technically all of my savings are in bitcoin as well, but that's because my clients are behind on their invoices and I just paid all of my bills.  However I'm far from a digital Scrooge McDuck.

Seconded.  I've managed about a half dozen Blackberry servers over the years and PIN's are the Blackberry equivalent to sms-only phone numbers or contacts, and follow the format in the post.

Neat ... I can't really justify the upfront cost of mining anymore, but I've been exploring the possibility of doing a leased option until I can...

Seriously?!  Those are some thin skinned businessmen.  What was their business?  Giving up?
I live in NYC.  Every time I travel, I get at least one guy trying to give me some kind of deep Brooklyn accent ala Jon Travolta in Saturday Night Fever.  It's funny.

OK, how about some music jokes ... 
What do you call a guy that hangs out with a bunch of musicians?
*A drummer*
What's the difference between a violin and a viola?
*Viola burns longer*
How do you know a trombonist's kid is at the playground?
*He can't swing and he complains about the slide*

Fantastic.  This is exactly what I was trying to do, but was getting caught up in trying to figure out json that I wasn't getting anywhere.

I'm just skimming through it now, but I think this should be able to get me where I'm going.
