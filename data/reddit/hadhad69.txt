Maybe in your bedroom, in the real world being nice is the default.

At least with paypal the consumer has some recourse to refunds etc.

This forum is excellent. You are all delusional, funding each others pyramid schemes. I love it!
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:59:39
Contact the bank and make them stop the overdraft.
@_date: 2014-01-20 00:04:21
Yes, but with cash you [can often] go back to the vendor and find recourse. There is no such protection in bitcoin exchanges.

In the uk you can do bank transfers free and instantly to any account, its called faster payment I believe.

I think we should use 'Bitcoin of a gamble' as the header.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:16:30
I'm just here to laugh at you all.

If I enter a loan agreement, how is that theft? 
And what is bitcoin's value based on? How many dollars it's worth of course, because we all trust that a dollar today is a dollar tomorrow. A bitcoin though? 
I think it's a noble idea, decentralised currency, but it doesn't mean the first actor on the scene has got it right. And congratulations on forming the reply!

Cash is exchanged for something. You might even get a receipt! Put your money in bitcoin on some exchange and you have no protection whatsoever, as shown time and again. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 13:34:48
A bank has never stole my money, although they are not without fault. Unlike the hundreds ripped off by failed exchanges. I can transfer money from my bank to yours on the app on my phone maybe you just need a new bank. And perhaps the wit to form a reply but we can only ask for so much! 
@_date: 2014-06-01 07:37:39
Calm down you spastic.
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:26:58
You won't reply to me because you have no answers to my posts! All you can do is try, pitifully, to devalue my posts by copying them. 
Carry on, son. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:18:58
Will it even be worth it?


@_date: 2015-05-06 11:33:29
This is the problem with a 'currency' with no oversight. You can say goodbye to your money unless the dude feels gracious which I find doubtful. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:16:51
Ok so bitcoin will stop inflation now? Praise satochi! 
I agree the current system is not perfect but the issue of this post was op was ripped off by an exchange. I'm saying he has little recourse with such an emergent technology.
If you want to start a new financial paradigm, you are too far gone for me to help. God bless.

That also answers my follow-up question, thanks! Good luck with the scam, I mean scheme.
@_date: 2015-05-06 12:45:49
Except banks where we keep cash have countless safeguards for depositors. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:20:17
It's only January but I feel honoured!
I would say [your comment here(last year admittedly)]( was more stupid shit as you put it. Good luck with your pyramid scheme.

Do you have a terminal illness?

They're a waste of time. Go play stock broker if you want to be a gambling man. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:29:09
Right, so call me when your bitcoin exchange's deposits are guaranteed by oversight. Until then, any tom dick or harold can open an exchange and simply turn off the lights one night.

Just found out I've got £2.49 and nowhere to withdraw it to lol

Hey man, saw you fighting the good fight in these threads yesterday too. Don't mind the downvotes, I for one find the whole thing very suspect. Combined with the Victoria following them on twitter etc...

OP bought $30,000 worth of bit coins at $14/BTC, current rate for bit coins is $128/BTC (On  So his investment could theoretically be worth around $274,285 today (Although OP did say he didn't put the full whack into straight coinage).
