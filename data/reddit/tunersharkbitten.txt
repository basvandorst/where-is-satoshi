yup.  its basically a message of "where the fuck did i put that 100k worth of bitcoin? OH SHIT ITS GONE" 
nothing that is actually promoting the value or technology behind it.  
the show is worthless to be perfectly honest.  in reality, a show that makes people think that smart people are smart, but are really just making fun of their carelessness.

I tell each and EVERY single person that asks me how to get into bitcoin "how much are you willing to invest?" and when they tell me, i ask them "are you willing to lose all of it?"
if they say no, then i tell them that bitcoin(and investing for that matter) is not for them.  only had a couple people say no.  about 20 people have said yes.  each and every one of them received a refer-a-friend link to coinbase.

2: the person that is more interested in it as a "math problem" instead of the technology that holds it all together
3: and finally, the person who hears the word bitcoin and jumps in and thinks they are all cool just because they heard someone else mention something about it(comic book store owner).

i hate that too.  most of the people that ask me have no interest in the technology or the economical potential it has, just the potential for them to make a quick buck.  in those cases i ALWAYS send them a link to the refer-a-friend for coinbase and tell them to buy 100 dollars worth.   that way, at least i make 10 dollars off of them, regardless of what they do.  i have made about 200 dollars so far that way.

@_date: 2017-11-27 02:44:32
not likely tonight.  unless the chinese start buying en masse(which IS possible).
what is likely is a 400-500 dollar correction, and then a backbuilding over the course of 3-4 hours.  then a spike to just below 10k at around 1430 UTC.  then it might hover around 9950 and then break thru 10k before noon.  
just my prediction.  all based on what i have seen for other landmark values.

no it isnt.   more INVESTORS is good for us.  there are a ton of people out there right now that intend on using bitcoin as a day trading hobby.  those are not the kind of people we need buying right now.  
think about it like this: when building a house, the most important thing is a solid foundation.  we are still building a foundation.  when you have a weak foundation, you have the potential for a total collapse.  at least once the foundation is laid, if a hurricane knocks the house down, we will still have the foundation.

what is happening right now is not a bubble bursting.  it is just normal corrections.

unlikely that the bubble will actually burst.  it will probably just have a bunch of corrections.   lotta people trying to get in their buys right before the hard fork. i moved all my money out of a wallet to coinbase so i can try and take advantage of it.  sell all the forked currency to buy more bitcoin.  i have a feeling that is what a bunch of people are doing...

@_date: 2017-11-26 06:01:05
OP, dont let anyone discourage you for how much you have.  I bought 200 dollars worth just before BTC hit 800.  that gave me .250 worth of bitcoin.  that is ALL i ever spent.  i still have .250 worth of bitcoin and can you guess how much that is worth now?  
my point is this: you bought it early.  it is still in its INFANCY.  its crawling still.  imagine how much your btc will be worth once it stands up, and starts to walk(in my opinion 25000 per).  and then imagine how much it will be worth when it starts to run(IMO around 100,000) 
HODL and stand proud to be part of the 1% of the future.  DOWN WITH FIAT MONEY!!! LONG LIVE THE BITCOIN
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:02:48
This is a GREAT question.  You have a lot of great points.  Personally, if I were a trader at a large firm and CME futures were right around the corner (and I had predicted accurately that BTC would break 10k before CME went live) I would have gotten together a shit ton of capital to buy bitcoin at around 5-7k.  Growing that a bit to make myself some money from the point where a bunch of like minded individuals end up selling them while also shorting on the same track.  Make money for yourself, while making a bunch of money for the investors.  Then you rinse and repeat.  But the problem is that now that the price is low again, they would be competing with people that are looking for that discounted coin.  So the discounted coin gets snapped up by HODLers, and the bosses give the investors more money to use for the bitcoin tactics.  
You see where im going with this right?

i stopped calling it a dip.  it is a minor correction.  it corrected slightly from 9700 to 9500, and now it is moving up again.   kinda like an aircraft gaining altitude.  going from a climb to a level flight isnt always parabolic.  sometimes there is a slight correction in altitude.

IIRC I think I got a bitcoin tip from him 3 years ago.  It was like 1-2 dollars worth.  I had COMPLETELY forgotten about it until 1 year ago when the holding company or wallet service was going offline.  I noticed that the value of what the person had given me was dozens of times more valuable than when I had gotten it.  
And that is when I invested in bitcoin.

it wont break 10k TODAY, but maybe  tomorrow(monday).  we still have a MAJOR correction inbound.  probably 400-500 dollars.  but i doubt it will drop below 9k.  especially after all the turkey day talks and black friday buying.  shit, 3 people i know bought all their black friday purchases with bitcoin(newegg.com).

there are plenty of people out there that have sell triggers for this region.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:13:51
you can never tell with certainty, but there tend to be trends.  
after a spike, there tends to be a correction, then a backbuilding(or what i like to call a bolstering) phase where it gets back up to that spike price, and then it keeps going.  oftentimes the spike will be 200-400 dollars, but it can be more.  it jumped 1000 in a day once.  
but like mentioned, "crypto is chaos"  and you can really only speculate as to the outcome.  
which is why it is only advisable to invest only as much as you are willing to lose.  
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:26:08
haha, yeah today doesnt look very promising for it going up to 6700.  maybe tomorrow.  friday is payday for a lot of people so it is possible that we will see a nice jump then.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:59:50
i agree that i am a bit impatient, and unwilling to teach people that are unwilling to utilize the tools that they have.  
If they are incapable of google searching "what is bitcoin", surely they are incapable of grasping what bitcoin is and why it is important for the future of technology.  whether it be preconceived notions or technological ignorance, they are the wrong people to be  investing in bitcoin.  they would only hurt themselves financially in the long run.  they would panic sell at the slightest dip, and when asked why they sold in the middle of such an upward sweep, they would say "it felt like it was going to crash"
it is not just ignorance, but discomfort and unwillingness to change.  patience wont do squat for those individuals.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:40:19
yeah, this person not only sounds like he ISNT a very good friend, but he probably isnt someone you want to associate with.  
you tried to give him an investment tip, and he spat in your face.  repeatedly.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:14:27
My way of doing it is I set 2 numbers. One reasonable.  Usually 200 dollars to 300 dollars lower than when the drop started. Once it goes past that I monitor it closely. If it gets to my "wishlist" number, I will buy, no matter how much further it dips. My wishlist number is 500 to 700 dollars lower. I have only ever gotten my wishlist number once. And that is how I justify buying the dip and my method behind it
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:06:23
I had a bunch of friends ask me if it was worth buying bitcoin now that it was almost 10k, and that they couldnt afford buying one.  i told them that they didnt need to buy a WHOLE bitcoin, but a few of their responses was "but what will they send me if i buy a part of one? a piece of a coin?"
I stopped responding to these individuals.  these are not the types of people we want buying bitcoin.  they have literally no concept of what bitcoin even is, nor do they have the interest in researching it in the slightest.  they want a "go fast to get rich" scheme and will drop their bitcoin at the hint of a correction.  
3 of my friends asked the right questions though.  they asked about the blockchain and how bitcoin is related.  they asked how to purchase it and how to store it.  they asked about trying to trade it and try and game the system(i warned them away from that entirely).

im not certain as to how it works, but all i know is that when i see a string of green the numbers typically rise.  if the green stream is broken with a red bar, the price goes down temporarily but as long as the numbers are flowing green, the price rises. 
i think some of those red bars are delayed transactions or automated transactions set for a specific numerical value.

this is good for those of us that intend on hodling for the long term.  we KNOW that this is what is going on, and we KNOW that every time there is FUD mongering, the value will dip.  but we take advantage of this and buy in and HODL because in 5-10 years when fiat currency is far less popular, and when bitcoin is sitting pretty near 100k per coin or more, we can live better quality lives because we were early adopters.
