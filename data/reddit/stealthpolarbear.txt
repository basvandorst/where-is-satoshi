Probably because if someone posts something like this they more than likely don’t know the basics. Better to be informed than spread false info to other people that don’t know the basics.

You should increase your dictionary usage back up to 100% then. If you dropped it 40% in the last 7 days and continue to make these basic mistakes, it’s probably not the smartest move.

But he wasn’t talking about all crypto investors. He was talking about those that let crypto become a part of their identity. For some reason you are missing that part of it...
From the article:
“Many of them don't treat bitcoin as an investment. Instead, bitcoin becomes part of their identity.
And when that happens, it becomes nearly impossible to change — even when they've lost a ton of money.”

This article is 100% spot on. You might be proving his article correct, and you don’t even see it. The fundamental message of the article WAS NOT that everyone in the cryptocurrency market  was suffering from delusion. 
However, if you felt offended and identified with that sentiment, then you very well might be. 
The fundamental premise of the article is that people get wrapped up in self identities that they can internalize irrational messages so much that they refuse to admit when they are wrong about something. This affects their ability to act rationally on certain matters that are tied to that identity.
Direct quote: “But be extremely cautious about the messages you tell yourself because once you internalize it, you’ll do anything to justify your choice.”

Because it’s investing 101. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Which means that the observation is meaningless, which is why people see it on every thread like this.

You know we can see when you edit your comments? 
If you had just left the original comment alone you could have avoided another error. It should be, “making *the* world”. I guess it’s back to the editing board for you.

You have no clue what my investments are. Everyone reading your posts can see you don’t know how to use a dictionary though.
