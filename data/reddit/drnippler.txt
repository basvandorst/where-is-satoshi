Is it going to pop?

% of sign-ups per million inhabitants:
Country | [Population]( | % Signups | signups/1m pop
Netherlands | 16,861,500 | 6.57% | **0,389%**
Germany | **80,716,000** | 8.56% | 0,106%
United Kingdom | 64,105,700 | **21.25%** | 0,331%
In absolute numbers, the UK might win, but per inhabitant the Dutch are leading in signups!

Using Bitpay is great for you because you have instant conversion to fiat currency and have no volatility issues. But, since you have a bitcoin only story, it's quite a basic thing to see the (estimated) price of a product before you press the purchase button!

I even like the conclusion: "Bitcoin, a global revolution in money or a bubble about to burst. Perhaps, like the early days of the internet, both.". 
When I explain Bitcoin to people, they always point out the exponential growth and volatility, that's not what Bitcoin is about. Because Bitcoin is new, exciting and mind-bending in a financial perspective, speculation and hyping are jacking up the prices. I think that "the big crash" is still to come, after which the bubble has burst and we can finally get into the real purpose of Bitcoin: improving the world of finances.

Since the Apache config language is turing complete, yes. I don't have any experience with nginx, but it seems turing complete too.

You can create your own entropy for offline private key generation, using a die or coin.

Great, but at current prices, it's almost better to use an exchange.

It's pretty hard to give a summary, but I'll try. There are 3 articles in the paper:
**Who profits from Bitcoin?**
* Explains the creation of a Bitcoin address, how to buy and explains mining.
* Names some of the early adaptors and some of the scams with Bitcoin.
* Explains the philosophy behind the Bitcoin.
* Has a short interview with Roger Ver (over skype, because landlines are too expensive LOL).
**Does Bitcoin really have a future?**
* Cites some warnings from the banking world.
* Explains that there are huge fluctuations on the exchanges.
* Notes Bank of America's statement from last friday.
* States that the bitcoin could have huge potential, if it surpasses it's infancies.
**(Opinion piece) The teenager of the monetary system**
* States that the opinions on Bitcoin differ alot.
* States that the fluctuations don't help the Bitcoin to become a currency, instead of a speculatory stock.
* States that the Bitcoin gets you into a kind of 'frontier' way of thought.
* States that the Bitocin has no regulations and is non reversable. That makes it attractive to criminals.
* States that the Bitcoin is still in it's infancy, and looks like it's a experiment gone wild. They would like to see the experiment grow and learns from there mistakes, rather than to kill it right now.

I have a digital copy of the paper, but I think that that would be a violation of copyright law.

Thanks for the advice! New post over [here](

Too bad it's behind a pay-wall which doesn't accept Bitcoin!
