To be completely fair thats only a US problem...
I am from the Netherlands and when I want to buy something online I open my bank mobile app and just scan the QR code.

No he is not right. Your whole net worth is 100k so here is what can happen. 
A. You win, get a bit rich. Cool right?
B. You lose everything, you have absolutely nothing anymore. All you worked your entire life for is gone.
Sure if you were rich too, or toss the coin several times then its a great bet. But you are betting your entire life for a potential slight increase in your way of life.

I really beg to differ. At this moment my mother owns a house worth 120k EUR. And I still can't believe how easier and better it is to already own your hose and not having to worry about anything. You don't have to think "What if we miss rent?"(or payment on mortgage)  You own that house, you can do whatever you want to do, and only pay for the most basic bill each month (electricity, water, internet) and even if you don't you still got the house.
Even if you were offering me 10 million so 1:100 on a 50/50 chance I wouldn't take it.

You are all missing the point. Sure it is if you do multiple tries, people will take it without a second of thought.
But as a 1 time offer its either win big or lose all. And the quality of your life won't increase as much when you win all as it will decrease when you lose all.

So if someone comes up to you and says they invested some money recently your immediate thought is that they gave some money to charity? Or is your first thought that they put their money into something expecting monetary return?

The question is "should i use my money on x to get more money?"
The only appropriate answers are yes, no, and something like "if you want to get more money you should invest in y".
Here he is just straight up telling him to give away his money. That is not the question and no "investing in future" is not the investing he is talking about.
Its the same as saying "hey guys anyone knows a good place to stay under 800/m?
And some prick answering that he should give this money to homeless.

Oh come on, you know god damn well that you are just bending the meaning of "investment" stop being an ass.
He was asking for investment advice, not a donation advice. And you are being an ass for thinking that its a proper answer.
