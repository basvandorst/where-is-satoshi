This is a great point about succession.  I would imagine many people will die in the coming years and their bitcoin will just be lost as there is no plan on how to pass it on to their loved ones.  My wife would have no clue how to recover my BTC and it is held on an exchange.
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:22:45
Yep bought the dip.  I am honestly glad it went down so I could pick up more.  I wanted to stock up prior to the New Year.
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:33:04
It may not even be intentional.  Some whale might have sold a few million to buy real estate or something.
@_date: 2019-11-14 19:54:34
I guess yeah.  By 2022 it won't matter if you bought at 7k or 10k.  I am assuming the price will be at 100k or higher.
@_date: 2019-11-15 18:03:12
mm = milimeter I thought.
@_date: 2019-11-20 21:34:54
The two ideas are not mutually exclusive.  I will admit I have heavily invested in BTC with the plan to get rich.  However, the reason I invested in BTC instead of a stock or something else is precisely because it is a good technology that will swallow up old tech.  Using money that is not tied to political ideology or company IS the future.  It is an easy decision.
This is precisely why Libra is doomed to fail before it begins.  Mark Z. plans to peg it to several national currencies... yeah thats a pass for me.
@_date: 2019-11-20 22:00:47
Failing and being the best are on extreme ends of the spectrum.  I am sure some people will use Libra but as a crypto it is orders of magnitude worse than Ethereum or BTC.
@_date: 2019-11-20 22:41:44
To me Libra (and others) are trying to get the benefit of crypto but in the process they are gutting it.  The amazing thing about crypto was its decentralized nature and lack of political affiliation.  They are taking the concept of crypto and stripping it of its strengths.  These so called "stablecoins" are shit relative to other cryptos.
btw putting "stable" in your name doesn't mean the value will actually be stable.  By linking to political entities they are intrinsically weakening their currency.
Each crypto should live and die by its own merits not whatever happens to be in the news about "x" country or "x" company.
Pegging to an asset is different.  I could get behind a crypto linked to the price of gold.  That would actually be bad ass.
@_date: 2019-11-14 19:53:18
I totally agree with that.  I have more fear of it going to 100k and beyond than me buying some and losing 20-40%.  Thanks for pointing this out.  This is actually very helpful in getting me to just buy.
@_date: 2019-11-13 18:56:24
I am so confused and I don't know what to feel.  I really hate these and really love these all at the same time.
@_date: 2019-11-14 16:17:01
I love BTC but really dislike paper investments!  Good luck tho
@_date: 2019-11-15 18:42:19
word.  I have never heard of that.  If I want to abbreviate million I just write "4M" or "20M"  that is what I have seen and seems to be most standard.  But hey, I am not an accountant.
@_date: 2019-11-14 00:25:37
I agree with this.  I was just wondering what people thought in terms of short term best time to buy.
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:18:52
Feel free to laugh.  People always ridicule what they don't understand and what is new.  The internet was thought of something that wouldn't work and is just for nerds and look at where we are now.
The principle is that new technologies will swallow up old technologies and make them obsolete.  Fax machines and Blockbuster were made obsolete by better technologies.  It might not be BTC but some form of crypto/block chain technology will take over in a massive way over the next 5 years.
@_date: 2019-11-15 20:49:44
Fair enough.  I am just talking about what is common usage or at least what should be common usage :)
@_date: 2019-11-07 18:42:10
Large banks are looking like Blockbuster in 2007
@_date: 2019-11-18 22:46:45
This is so cool.  Pretty damn sick that BTC can be used without the internet.  This is very powerful for undeveloped places where internet is a luxury.
@_date: 2019-11-07 22:16:57
What do I think banks do?  Not much in the future.  The main function of a bank in theory is to keep money safe.  Once crypto becomes more popular people will realize you don't need a physical bank to keep your money safe.
Even without banks there is still ways to finance loans.  Look at something like Kickstarter, most of the ideas on there wouldn't/couldn't be funded by banks.  Similarly, there is nothing that stops other people from starting a company that specializes in financing other companies and start ups.
The bottom line is that physical banks are an antiquated technology and the amount they make is way out of line with the value that they contribute.
@_date: 2019-11-12 16:57:19
Keep learning and going for it and I am sure you will succeed.  Great work so far!
@_date: 2019-11-14 22:03:07
I am with you bro.  I am also long term buyer and believer just looking to buy dips.  Either way I will be buying.
@_date: 2019-11-20 19:12:58
Wrong.  Those numbers are the same.  Don't believe me ask the FBI.
@_date: 2019-11-14 21:54:11
Thanks.  This is the exact "type" of feedback I wanted.  Cheers!
@_date: 2019-11-13 00:05:12
2 or 3 years is not a long time to see 28x growth.
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:56:45
The decentralized nature of BTC and any other crypto worth anything makes it very different than the current system.  The KYC rules, national fiat currencies, and the banking system will be disrupted.  Not only disrupted, but in large part they will be replaced by a superior tech.
@_date: 2019-11-20 23:56:59
I don't mean backing the coin with physical gold, just pegging the price of the coin to what the gold spot price is.  There will be fluctuation but minimally based on what the price of gold is doing.
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:12:25
preaching to the choir on this bro.
@_date: 2019-08-02 20:57:47
Again strongly disagree.  If you think there is such a thing as a "safe index fund" then we likely won't find common ground.  Good luck!
@_date: 2019-08-02 20:47:42
Strongly disagree.  Gold is the ultimate defensive investment whereas the public market is extremely volatile.  Gold will seem like the best investment ever in economic hard times like in 1987 or 2008.  Someone in their 60s will have lived through both events and could have been financially ruined twice.  Without some defensive assets you are very exposed.  Personally, I would never put more than 10% of my net worth in the market regardless of distribution.  If growth and ROI is what you want then pursue real estate.
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:13:16
Is there a subreddit to discuss buying gold coins and such.  I am interesting in learning about buying gold coins but know nothing.  I am Canadian btw.  Is buying from your linked site a good idea with good prices overall?
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:31:42
damn.  sorry man.
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:44:37
Thanks!  I figured it would be something so simple as r/gold lol.  My plan is to try and buy physical gold as close as possible to spot price.
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:24:19
I don't think this is good for kids.  It will just inflate their ego.  Just go have fun and be a kid.  If you are under 18 you shouldn't be worrying about the GDP and the banking system.  This is a strange cultural phenomena where we are propping up kids to somehow be spokespeople for complex issues.
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:32:07
I have always enjoyed Robert's content.  He is the real deal.
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:24:04
You seem a little too worried about what other people think or the feedback you might receive.  Just make your prediction and stand by it - that is what everyone has to do.
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:55:22
Thanks!  I figured it would be something so simple as r/gold lol.  My plan is to try and buy physical gold as close as possible to spot price.
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:58:32
Efficient Market Hypothesis...lol.  This is kind of my point.  Many people advocating the market offer theory instead of solid facts grounded in the real world.  I am not really interested in debating this.  If you think the market will return you 8-10% then put all your money in the S&amp;P.
@_date: 2019-10-30 21:12:53
haha this is so true and how I feel about BTC right now.
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:08:05
Incredibly optimistic regarding the S&amp;P.
Gold is a great hedge depending on what you think the future holds.
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:58:29
Really?  I am interested in why you think that.  Send me down a rabbit hole.  I always thought he was cool and had good insight.
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:37:25
Imagine if all the struggling economies just switched to BTC like Venezuela and Chile.  If every currency that failed switched to BTC that would facilitate BTC taking over globally rather fast.
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:54:27
Thanks.  I do want to buy in the dips.  I am in no rush.  Approx what would be considered a dip?  What is a good buy price that would be conceivable in the next 1 or 2 years?
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:59:06
I am not "in the know".  I always just liked his stuff.  What should I look at?

I know this is the funniest part of that whole narrative.  Drug dealers will use crypto....mmmmkay.  
How many drug deals are just USD ?....inconvenient truth right there....

Anyone against getting out of "personal" debt is retarded.  There are of course advantages to taking on debt in business or leveraging assets to get ahead.  However, on a personal level we should be spending less than we make and be paying off any debts.  The end game is to have money to invest where you make passive income whether it is from stocks or by directly investing in a company or by owning real estate.  If you are consistently spending more than you make and are in debt then you will be a slave for your whole life until you figure out how to get out of debt.  Debt totally kills hope, freedom, and enjoyment of life.

Seeing zuck get roasted by this black lady is really fun! (around 30 min mark)
@_date: 2019-10-30 15:53:35
I was making the distinction between borrowing for business vs. just overspending as an individual.  With low interest rates people should be borrowing for business or for projects that can return a profit.  On the other hand regardless of interest rates going into debt personally is always a bad idea. People should be spending less than they make month to month regardless of what interest rates are doing.
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:11:09
What does saving even mean?  The idea of saving up money in your mattress or putting it in the bank earning nothing makes no sense.  Again, there is no economy where I would recommend saving in the sense of just piling up money.  Whatever extra money people have needs to be working for them.  We can invest in a company directly or via stocks.  We can start a business or we can buy real estate.  There are many things that can be done to make your money work for you.  Saving, in the sense of just stockpiling money is always a waste of potential.
When I talk about debt I am not talking about taking out a mortgage.  Most people that have debt it is just personal debt from overspending on stuff like holidays, cars, and clothes etc.

Yeah I hear you.  My plans are not just to play xbox but I can play xbox if I feel like it.  Maybe get high and sit in the hot tub.  Who knows.  That is the joy of having financial security.  
I will for sure be working regardless of how much money I have but it won't be for someone else and on someone else's schedule - thats really the key for me.
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:17:11
You gotta have lofty goals man.  Aim for 10k and maybe end up with 6.  If you aim for 2k/month then you might end up with 1200.  Just my philosophy to push myself and have goals beyond what I think I can actually attain.
@_date: 2019-12-12 22:58:17
Great answer.  I finally figured out the key to money management is having investments that create cash flow.
To me being rich doesn't really matter.  All I need is 10k/month passive income and I won't be working another 8-5 job in my life.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:56:30

Indeed I prefer laymans terms whenever possible.  What I have realized is that really smart people are usually trying to dumb things down so others can understand.  It is the people that make simple concepts *seem* complicated that are usually full of shit and just trying to sound smart.
@_date: 2019-09-10 17:00:45
I thought he did a decent job of selling it in laymans terms.  The basic concept is more security and not attached to any government/political system and he hit both those points.

My first gold.  This is where I am supposed to thank you but I refuse :)
After reading the explanation from Reddit I totally don't understand the benefit of gold and the members only r/lounge sounds like a hangout for virgins :)
@_date: 2019-09-04 18:09:51
Just my hunch.  I don't think this was developed by 1 person.  There is just too much complexity.  IMO it was developed by a team of 2-3 people that all worked on their own parts of the project.  If it was just the one dude then - kudos.
