Idk I'm skeptical.  You can look through their 10-Q filings here:
The quarter ended Sept 20 shows an increase of 28% in gross profit comparing the same quarter 2012 to 2013.  They still have a positive net profit, though it decreased slightly from 1.33% to 1.17% comparing 2012 to 2013 annual.
I don't think it's because the business was floundering as much as they saw it an opportunity to capture an untapped market that nobody was willing to sell to.  
Decreasing profit margins may have been some extra incentive to get it started early.

If you believe in bitcoin, your best bet is to buy some bitcoin and hold long-term.
Miners have long since been replaced by ASICs, which are specialized hardware used for mining that consume small amounts of power and have exponentially better performance than CPU/GPU mining. It is **not** profitable to mine without an ASIC.
The problem with getting a good ASIC is that many manufacturers have been suspected of using their own miners until it becomes more profitable for them to sell or ship it at a high price.
Basically if you pay for a high end miner, and get it tomorrow, you might be able to make some good money, but getting it tomorrow is extremely unlikely.  
Even some of the more reputable companies have been sold out of their early shipments, and you can put $6k down for something that will arrive in May.  If you look at OP's graph, a $6k miner might take a while to break even starting in May as opposed to today.

Would support for what you're saying be found in that book?  
I've been looking for a good read too.

To be fair though, bitcoin has just as much to do with the internet as it does with economics.
What the future holds will be very interesting, as we have two Nobel Prize winners in economics predicting generally opposite outcomes.
What I really wonder is why Krugman is so quick to denigrate bitcoin even while it's in its infancy.  Bitcoin clearly isn't a threat to the centralized banking system in its current state, yet Krugman is so unequivocally against it, and doesn't even take the time to consider its possible merits.

I don't think that's quite right.  There definitely are incentives to sell in an inflationary currency.  Though the value of money decreases over time, the value of the product will usually also decrease over time due to advances in technology.  It's probably more like:
Deflationary: No incentive to spend
Inflationary: No incentive to save
There is definitely an incentive to sell in a deflationary currency, but it seems like trade could suffer because there is now an incentive to save bitcoins.  Inflationary currency inherently favors trade because the moneys gonna be worth less tomorrow anyways, so might as well spend it.  
Whether or not a sale is ultimately made, is up to the demand and not the supply anyways, so it would seem like the incentive to sell is weaker than the incentive to spend.

Yes, often the wealthy may invest in low-risk low-productivity assets like gold, but I would view that as trying to resist the natural tendency of an inflationary marketplace.  The market logic dictates that you would probably be more successful investing in more productive assets, but the bear-ish moods prevail in some cases.
Bitcoin on the other hand, being a deflationary currency, actively encourages that type of behavior, which is detrimental to the market.  Being a bear in a deflationary currency gets the upper-hand, just by default.
Full Disclosure:  I am like 95% on the bitcoin bandwagon.  The remaining 5% are my concerns about how it will scale up to mass adoption.  In this thread or a another, someone mentioned the U.S. government owning a significant amount of bitcoins from the seizure of the silk road.  What's to stop them from crashing the market in 5-10 years by dumping all those bitcoins after bitcoins have skyrocketed in value?

That doesn't sound fair to me.  In any sector, one would expect material goods to lose their value over time.  
For example, how would it profitable for any car company to hold on to their cars every year instead of trading them for an inflationary currency?  I'm pretty sure the auto industry is pretty devoid of monopolies as well.
Even increasing the quality of goods may not be enough.  Unless it's necessary, people will fall into the line of thinking "I don't really need that, my money is gonna be worth more next year anyways."  This thinking stifles trade and hurts the market overall.

So you're predicting that bitcoin will eventually become equivalent to a  global index fund?
I haven't heard that one before, but it's an interesting possibility.

You can try but good luck.  I've heard far too many horror stories here to consider dumping $6k into a potential paper-weight.

[Milton Friedman]( discussed the possibility of an internet currency that has the same characteristics as bitcoin.  
Not exactly supporting it, as he died a bit before bitcoin was invented, but a strong argument for why something like bitcoin could be successful.

You aren't using the word monopoly correctly.  Import taxes on cars exist everywhere around the world.  Even domestically, there is competition between a few major players.
Trade for the sake of trade **is** good. If trade shrivels up because people start hoarding, then there is less incentive in capital investment. You get a less productive workforce because nobody wants to fund a start-up when there's no cash involved.  It's also how wealth redistribution happens.
I'm not saying that putting pressure on the producers to make a better product is a bad idea.  I'm just saying the logic behind a deflationary currency is that it's wiser to save now and spend later. Whereas an inflationary currency it's wiser to invest now because dollars will be worth less in the future.
