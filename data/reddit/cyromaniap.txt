Brings a new meaning to blockchain.

I bought some earlier today around noon and got an email around 8pm this evening same email. I usually buy through Gemini but I happened to be out and about and bought the dip with Coinbase. As soon as I got the email I went to Gemini and bought the same amount again for even better deal. Going to call tomorrow and verify I wasn’t charged from Coinbase but I chalked it up to a suspected fraud and that was the reason for the cancellation. Although just two days ago Gemini went through just fine and it was for the same amount. Glad to know it wasn’t just me.

Is there a way to avoid using it or is this fork going to make a new crypto just like the bitcoin and bitcoin cash? What you are saying is this fork is not in favor of decentralized blockchain and thus no one using the crypto this fork creates and all the issues it faces die with that crypto?

To an extent it is yes but it also allows you to encrypt your 2FA when a new device signs in. So even if someone gets into it they still would need to decrypt it to view the codes.

On one of the current episodes of Grey's Anatomy the hospital was "hacked" and they demanded 5000 bitcoin to restore functions.

Try and transfer it to your wallet and flee the country..

Authy has a multi device option I leave enabled to allow multiple devices in the case my phone breaks or gets stolen. I’m multiple android phones switched and now on iPhone. Not one issue.

What do you mean by bubble?

Right no I totally agree I bought two ethereum to start out and play with and I'll probably but the $1000 or so into Bitcoin. That way I have some things to play with and while if I lost it all I would be pretty upset I know that comes with this territory and it wouldn't disrupt my living in any way. I've got other investments that I involve my funds with. 
Why do you say don't let them trick you about other coins? Bigger risk/penny stock/hype vs Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:47:53
Care to elaborate?

That's my thinking.. diversify. This isn't my only investment either Gold, Silver and just plain cash never hurt anyone. Something I need to get over in my mindset is the fact it's plenty okay to invest 100 here or 1000 here and not be as focused on the amount of actual whole Bitcoin I buy because for one Im not that rich. My other idea I can't grasp is how little Bitcoin you are actually getting for that amount of money. Maybe it's because I know how low it used to be?
