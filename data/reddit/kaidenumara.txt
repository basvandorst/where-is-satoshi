Sorry to hijack, trying not to make my own thread. Ive run into a problem that i cant seem to find an answer to on the google machines.
I made a 100 dollar purchase using bitcoin, first time ever using it.
My transaction says it was sent off block chain, but its been hours and the money is not posted. If i open up the transaction link in my email, it says it currently has 0 of two verifications needed. Which seems to be not off block chain? 
So im not sure how to tell if it was sent off the chain or not. I hope it was not sent on chain because I did not add any sort of tip to the transaction for miners as nothing was there.
Sorry for being confused bitcoin scrublord!

ok i see. thank you for the help. looks like i just need to be patient and wait since as you said everyone trying to jump on the bitcoin boat right now. worst case it get the coins back in a day or two.

I'm new to bitcoin. Am in the middle of trying to make a 100 dollar purchase with bitcoin because paypal is not available for the purchase right now. 4 hours later i still dont even have 1 of the 2 required blocks or whatever its called to complete the transaction.
im thinking i did something stupid when it comes fees and im at the very bottom of any list to process. its an interesting currency but im still learning. today is the first day ive ever even messed with it

ok i think i understand why i was confused now. the transfer from coinbase to gdax was off block. the payment from gdax to the game card company is on block and is waiting for two verifications from miners to process. 
thats the transaction with transaction identifiers deleted
hopefully i did not screw myself by not putting in a fee for the miners. i did not notice an option to do it anywhere
