Well unlike Mark Karpelles he is not a founder of a private corporation, he is a public bureaucrat who clearly lied either on Feb 10 or Feb 11 your pick.

Curious how a technical point about why only shareholders are qualified to ask for CEO resignation by iwolf gets voted down out of existence while numerous vulgar obscenities stay. I guess we get the culture we deserve.

Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan was not jailed in derivatives fiasco in 2008. Instead Timothy Geithner and Ben Bernanke rewarded JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs with over a trillion dollars of US taxpayers money. Now JPMorgan writes that fiat is infinitely better than bitcoin. Really?

Right, just like when trustworthy John Sculley was brought in at Apple to replace Steve Jobs in 1985. 
Never throw the founder "under the bus" like Kleiner Perkins did last week.

I completely agree. Gavin Andersen response to MtGox bug report was arrogant and he was proven wrong within 24 hours. How can be a bug which allows repeated withdrawals of the same asset be not in top 10 list and not be fixed in 2 years?

I am sorry about my misspelling of Mr Andresen name. What about contradiction in his statements?

Comrades, your criticism is misguided. Starbucks latter aside, Karpeles is a working class hero. All those capitalist scum laundering their ill gotten gains on MtGox deserve to be punished!
