Mcafee claims a lot, but never has any substance. Well actually he has substance, its brown and smelly, and is called shit.

Mcafee is full of shit

I can see both sides for and against Craig White as satoshi.
Firstly there is the initial white paper. Wrote by someone with background in research and experience writing white papers. Would fit the background with a title Dr. 
However, their will be the doubts, and those doubts could be removed by moving 1 coin from 'satoshis' wallet. I would be happy to be that be receipient. My address is 
Add to that the NSA have done research to identify Satoshi Nakamoto, allegedly. So submitting paperwork to the SEC is pretty dumb considering the info can be fact checked.

It depends on the reason Nakamoto has resurrected. If he/they have cause for concern over bitcoin and crypto, the price may tank. Any unmasking would need to be handled with care.

This is going to stir the pot.

This has some quite serious consequences for bitcoin.
With a fixed supply of coins, this could ultimatly lead the all coins being held in dormant wallets. Thus no coins in circulation. Considerable supply issues.

Anyone that believes a single word from mcafee deserves to lose all their money, Crypto and remaining assets.
I have seen diarrhoea with more substance than what comes out of mcafees mouth.
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:15:01
You miss my point. If people are dying leaving dormant wallets, then without a way to recirculate the money, then eventually all coins, whole or fractions will be in dormant wallets.

When you can't own the tech, own the patent.

I don't buy this - 'their client'. Well they haven't done their client any favours as this will just increase the price (fiat to bitcoin) and cost their client more to buy in the long term. 
I would treat this, much like a lot I read around about bitcoin, not entirely credible.

The way is the samourai.
I have this wallet installed, and I can say it is a very good offering by the ninjas. 
The proof is in the pudding, so I can only suggest that you try it. But in my humble opinion the ninjas nailed it, and is one of the best wallets on a mobile.

If you help a person solve a problem, they may generously donate something. Coming cap'in hand like little bit Oliver saying 'please sir can I have some' is likely to result in nothing but laughter.
That's just my thought.

Corrected. I was still half asleep when I wrote it. I know, lame but unfortunately it is the truth.
@_date: 2019-05-28 15:04:19
This is just my humble opinion, but Craig White fits the profile as a possible candidate for Satoshi Nakamoto.
Which is more than can be said about a lot of the keyboard warriors spamming sub-reddits.
Satoshi Nakamoto has control over a lot of bitcoin. Had he wanted to dump a small amount of that, he would have done it at 20k. Which probably means that whoever Satoshi is, he does not have control over the wallet, either temporarily or permanently.
But these are just my thoughts.

You can work this out for yourself. If you do not know how to, speculation isn't for you.
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:01:15
I simply cannot accept this, and believe the moderators should remove this.
If you have a license to print bitcoin as you claim, you would not need to people to give you there money.
I strongly urge nobody touch this, and the mods to remove it.
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:09:48
In terms of speculation, isn't their like a word for this type of behaviour. It's something like collusion.
