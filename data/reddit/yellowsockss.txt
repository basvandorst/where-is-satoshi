im no econ major but my value is retained. i just wont be profiting from the raise in value of bitcoins in the little time.

because im buying it right back after my first paycheque

thanks! I sold all my holdings but thats only because i held one bitcoin. Even if BTC shoots up 100% in the next few months, I'm only losing a thousand dollars. I sold, but it wont be the last bitcoin i hold for sure. After my first paycheque, I'm going to be buying in on it monthly.
@_date: 2017-02-25 22:59:45
absolutely! my love and belief in BTC is higher than the current hashrate

what i mean was when i get my paycheques from my new job, ill be buying in monthly

thanks! I'm temporarily selling to secure my trip funds. I'll be re-entering the climb when i start receiving my pay cheques!

money means nothing until you use it

good thing i secured my funds a month ago. ill buy in again when it hits 800 again

many here dont understand risk management. i learned a lot day trading in my first year undergrad.

good call on your part. your prediction came true 
@_date: 2017-02-25 06:00:31
nicely executed! id like to buy mine at the bottom rung too but id rather not see that day for bitcoin anytime soon

i guess we share different ways of thinking. investments are always subjective to ones purpose for investing. i invested to retain my value not to become a millionaire.
i like to believe the backpack trip is a form of investment on myself. investment in oneself beats any other investment always. what will i do with bitcoin if it never served me when i need it the most? thats why i dont regret selling last month. ill buy in again after may

i dont see your point
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:45:55
ACTUALLY the money supply increased?
