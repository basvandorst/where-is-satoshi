What does this mean?

Thanks!

Won't the input I use with high fee (which is the output from smaller ones) also be very large in bytes?  That is, is it not the case that all the data (which is taking bytes to describe) from every input/output in past is included, so it will only be larger?

So the answer is, "no"?

How will this help?

That is what I was trying to do, but as I sent to new address, thee were fees.  Lots of fees
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:10:41
Yes, less.

7 years of faucets and and old computers in pools

Unless there is another way to send to another address that does not require fees?

so far confirmed move around 0.6BTC with a fee of around 0.002.  Thanks for this advice.

When I tried to move the total in one transaction, it told me the transaction size was too large (in bytes).  Through trial and error I found small enough amounts that did not give the transaction size error, but ended up being high byte/BTC ratio, so the fees ate up a lot.

Empirically (see   etc) your argument that volatility is decreasing seems to not be the case, as it is trending up over the last ~18 months (during which period adoption has increased explosively, as measured by number of new accounts on trading sites).
Not only that, Your post implies you misunderstand the term "liquidity", important since the inverse relationship between liquidity and volatility is central to your claim.

I am learning.  As I am complaining about people giving useless/incorrect/speculative responses, it would be hypocritical of me to turn around and post answers to questions for which I do not have the expertise to answer.  
As you (hopefully) noticed, I was vocally appreciative of the help received in that thread
