Lol like anyone on this sub could tell you that with any certainty

The problem with that logic is that DNM's using bitcoin has nothing to do with it being a good currency, and everything to do with the fact that it's easier to keep anonymous, which really doesn't matter when it comes to bitcoin as a mainstream currency 
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:15:07
Assuming your not just making a joke, I meant it being used as an actual currency for more then just illegal internet dealings that need it for the anonymity 
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:24:59
As an actual currency? Very much so, yes.
But now most people see it as an investment, instead of something they can use to buy stuff, and are disappointed that it isn't shooting through the moon 24/7

So I don't really know much about bitcoin. With the recent volatility and massive difference in market prices, is there something stopping people from making insane amounts of money very quick by just buying and reselling coins to a different market all day? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:31:56
So criticizing the Chinese government is racist... Because the government recognizes 56 ethnic groups? What are you talking about? It sounds like you are repeating some propaganda shit
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:34:02
At least we have uncensored internet and freedom of speech to criticize our government
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:59:10
Not to mention the volatility. Steam just *stopped* accepting bitcoin for these reasons exactly, and other places have done so too. And now we are supposed to believe Amazon is going the complete other way

I wouldn't believe everything OP says. As many comments have pointed out, there's strong evidence he fell for a phishing scam and is trying to blame it on binance and get them to cover his ass.
In addition to what many other users have pointed out, op's statements aren't consistent. In some comments he said it couldn't be a phishing scam because all messages "were through the official binance site", and in other places he says they asked to Skype over email.

... On the bitcoin subreddit. Is it really that absurd to assume that people talking about losses on a bitcoin subreddit are talking about bitcoin losses? 
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:21:15
That wouldn't make any sense though. The post is about 'bags' being down 40%. Does that not mean one purchase you made that you are holding on to? Also he said he was down 90% and 'not selling'. That makes it sound like he means one purchase that he's down 90% on but isn't going to sell. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:43:35
But then that's not 90% down on bitcoin, which is what he was implying 
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:09:18
I would, if there was anything that I bought on a weekly basis that I could use bitcoin for
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:38:36
Is that not literally impossible? The most you can be down on bitcoin right now is 70% if you bought at ATH
@_date: 2018-08-12 18:40:08
Tell that to the majority of Bitcoin users, who see it as an investment, and would never spend it because that's less gains if it blows up again. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:36:09
How can you possibly be down 90%?? In order for you to be down 90% at current price ($6000), you would have had to buy bitcoin at a price of $60,000....
@_date: 2019-11-13 06:46:43
If they don't, memeing it is good way to make sure they do
@_date: 2018-06-08 02:31:57
I *am* the blockchain
@_date: 2018-06-08 02:33:13
Price doesn't matter, all that matters is up and down
@_date: 2019-10-14 21:50:12
TIL losing in the actual vote count but winning due to electoral college shananigans = "the biggest election victory imaginable"... Dude I think the biggest victory **imaginable** would be one candidate getting literally every vote, not the winning candidate LOSING the popular vote. Get your head out of your propagandized ass
@_date: 2019-10-15 13:32:33
It came from the original comment that I responded to, and he pretty clearly meant margin of victory
@_date: 2019-10-14 23:50:55


In terms of who wins the election, it doesn't *directly* determine anything. But it does show who the majority of voting Americans support. Also, I was just using that to say that Trump winning in the "biggest election victory imaginable" is bullshit propaganda he feeds to his rabid supporters
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:41:14
Judge, I would like to call my witness to the stand.
Poop. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 15:30:43
Do yourself a favor and read that comment again, really slowly. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 17:29:53
Just seemed like you didn't realize that it was a joke 
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:58:17
You must have not been on reddit at that time 
@_date: 2019-01-05 17:08:15
He said he's been **buying** at the **top**, and **selling** at the **bottom**. It's a joke. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:49:19
Nah, it's only going to hit $469k. A piece of paper I pulled out of my butt earlier today told me. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:59:55
Why anyone still uses large national banks confuses me, many of them fuck people over on the regular (looking at you Wells Fargo). Local credit unions are the way to go. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:40:24
Wells Fargo is the one that pisses me off the most. They literally got caught opening accounts and putting unneeded auto insurance in almost a million unsuspecting peoples names, only got a slap on the wrist in response, and people still trust them. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:15:30
Not trying to be a naysayer, but there were people saying it could only go up when it was almost at 20k. Nobody really knows what it's going to do
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:02:07
You can't argue that charging fees all at once for transactions made over the past year isn't scummy as fuck. Sure they can do it, and their customers can take their business elsewhere and tell them to fuck right off, which is exactly what this guy is doing. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 23:49:39
That doesn't make any sense. If anything, the fact that it failed to hold its price for even a short period of time, and fell sharply after almost hitting $20,000, shows that it was OVERvalued at the time. 
Regardless, I don't really think Bitcoin can be over or under valued. Unlike a stock it's value is not tied to anything real, so it's impossible to say it's over or under valued. The price of Bitcoin is determined by the demand alone. That is the value of Bitcoin, and it is also the price at any one time. It can't be over or under valued. On top of that, because it's not tied to anything real and you can put in any amount you want at any time, the dollar value of Bitcoin alone means nothing. The only thing that matters is if it goes up or down. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 21:47:18


Yes, because when the price of something spikes like that, it is often described as *overvalued* at the peak price. Yet for some reason you thought that meant it was undervalued?


I have no idea how you came to that conclusion. You keep telling yourself that. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 23:44:04
This right here. If you look at the last month, there are at least 4 examples of quick ~10% spikes both up and down. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:46:11
Pretty sure that's ketchup
