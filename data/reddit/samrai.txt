It’s Bitcoin and Bcash. Simple as that

I've had a horrible loss. I think this is specifically about being terminally I'll, not just losing someone else close to you 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:13:14
Need to call it Bcash. That is the only option

The banking sector is a terminally ill patient, previously in denial. 
The Kübler-Ross model, otherwise known as the five stages of grief, postulates a series of emotions experienced by terminally ill patients prior to death, or people presented by the loss of a loved one, wherein the five stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.

Bcash supporters timing their attack with the recent article by Emil Oldenburg: [here]( 
Basically just FUD. It’ll pass within a week and things will be back to normal. It’s buy the dip time!

Upvote this to the max!

It’s true. A fart really can take over a room quite quickly in stench, but will eventually fade out

Today I learnt that lambo are the car of crypto choice because the symbol is a bull

That's one thing I'm conscious of. Less than a year it's 50% of profits. I've heard over a year it drops to 25% of profits

That's what I mean. The merchant needs Internet for the transaction to happen. There are contactless cards being developed for crypto currently. Some are already out. So it's no different except the behind the scenes of what the merchant is accessing

Yes you're right. Trailing would be good. 
Some exchange don't even have stop loss. I would say because these exchange popped up quickly to try cash in from bitcoin. The more established exchanges probably started on other commodities

Always transfer your BTC away from a wallet when trying to retrieve BTG. Once you expose your private key to BTG is open for hacking basically

Bitcoin isn't money in a "fiat" sense until you cash it out. So even if the value goes up you're not actually earning money. 
Only if you were regularly withdrawing profits would you have an income. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:45:17
Did you get taxed when you withdrew your profits? 
Edit: saw AU

How much will each BTC be worth once it his 1 trillion market cap? I think that's a significant milestone 
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:07:45
Alright guys. The plan is we'll never let bitcoin dip. If we all agree, then moon lambos for all

I was just part of the POWR ICO and it's returned 500%+. 
Ethereum was once an ICO pretty sure. Basically you need to DYOR before you buy into a company with very little history. Need to be extremely confident.

All transactions still need Internet. I keep seeing people say "what about when there's no internet". You can't really use a eftpos machine without internet either ... 
In the future maybe one bitcoin represents $1million. People refer to dollars as Sats but still have a card. It's just how it operates behind the scenes that is different
It will become easier to access and purchase once higher adoption increases 
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:59:24
Because crypto is so volatile as it is. Leverage was designed for oil etc which barely moves. If you had a coin grow 500% like POWR has recently and had that on 5x leverage the company would go broke. The exchange would have to cash you out of their own $$$

This coin has a real world purpose. Not a pump and dump. It's Australian (where I am from) and is basically peer to peer energy sales. It's just scored contracts in several other countries because the test it had (backed by the Australian government) was a success. 
Moon lambo here we come. Just hit 1000% gains since ICO today 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:28:30
Here comes those moon lambos

What do you call this meme? I've tried to find it in GIFs previously. Its such a perfect response to so many situations 
@_date: 2018-02-19 02:40:44
I was under the impression you only need  to factor it into tax when you change it to fiat. 
If it’s a direct swap ie bitcoin &gt; steam game then there’s nothing to be taxed as it doesn’t ever enter fiat.

It’s called specialising. People looking specifically for this service will have faith in his skills and he can probably charge the same amount of work for a premium

Hectic. I tried to do this the other day thinking it would naturally happen but didn't work. Glad that it now can :)

I believe they think it's going to keep rapidly dropping and that they'll buy back in at the very bottom. 
More often than not they're selling at the bottom and buying after the bounce

Partially correct. 
Goku should be the mascot for bitcoin because Vegeta is commenting on Goku’s (bitcoin’s) power level when he says “it’s over 9000!”
