It will be interesting to see which country will be the first to implement cryptocurrency, I also like Estonia's idea of implementing it by offering e-residency.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:27:41
But they did not implement it as a currency, that is a major difference
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:15:00
100% agreed! Some countries are already looking at that option like Estonia and Singapore. I think the first pioneer country could have a big advantage over others

There was already a pop up House of Nakamoto but it was there for maybe a month before they closed it down just as fast as they had opened
But thanks for the advice :)

Ok thanks

How awesome would it be able to pay with BTC on Uber?
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:29:39
tht's right thanks
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:26:31
Yes he does. Just watched it very interesting  insight, thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:32:46
Oh did not know that was possible. How much do you pay in fees? 
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:43:51
But I get where you are coming from, I was initally thinking the same thing until I considered those points
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:14:58
Coming to Vienna any time soon?
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:34:00
What if you could put up credit of let's say 0.5 BTC or something. Would you use it then? What if fees are waved because they are supported by BTC? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:35:16
Yes I know that's why I am saying. It will be interesting to see though, who will be  the first one to dare. In my opinion it will be Singapore or some other Asian country, just because crypto is already much better established and also accepted by the general population than anywhere else. Time will tell

Check it out yourself:
Today's High $5,013.91 @ 2:25 UTC
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:08:39
Ok, whatever you say. I still think it's great for Crypto and a positive indicator that it is bound to go there soon and stay. Do you think differently?
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:03:03
I make sure I comment again when its 5k+ :P
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:04:44
Yes I know. I never mentioned anything about that. 
Now @ $4,672.79 which is fine still.
Why so offensive? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:05:24
True, I still think that's pretty good, don't you? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:02:51
I hope so. But it could also go the other way get shut down and be worth 0 soon
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:10:30
That's the only reason I shared it when I saw it because I thought the community would be as pleased as I was :) No more no less.
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:45:39
Thanks anyways
