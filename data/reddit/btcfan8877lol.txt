Does this mean that if we keep the block size fixed at the current 1MB, we'll be able to fit the whole block chain on a $17 computer ten years from now?
(I multiplied my original $5 with 1000KB/300KB to get $17.)
If this is the case, I'm wondering if it's a good idea to keep the current 1 MB size forever. What do you think about this?

Thanks so much! I think I could work with this.
One question: Is there any room here for accidentally doing something dangerous (i.e., losing bitcoins)?
Of course I'm assuming the destination address is correct and the 0.13 HD wallet is backed up. Apart from these basics, are there any other risks involved when following your instructions?

"It turns out it is possible to add almost any new feature with a soft fork."
This is because of the Segregated Witness innovation of Pieter Wuille, right?

Is this because of some particular code in the Bitcoin Core, or something else? Thanks.

I run Bitcoin Core as my wallet, so no BU miner will be able to fool me on what a real Bitcoin is.

These economic dinosaurs are kind of funny.
But they are also dangerous. They will take a lot of people down with them as they go extinct.

Thanks for the info. Didn't know this. One question: The GitHub "Release notes" are still independent from the ones in the repo, correct? In this sense: If I want more guarantees I'm getting the correct release notes, I should look at the ones in the repo instead.

Don't be fooled.
For example if you want low taxes, you're better off moving to an established, recognized country like Singapore.

I think you're partly right about ignoring him. Yet at the same time, hopefully some people who get bamboozled on bitcoin.com also come to to see all the RogerScams exposed.

This is what you get when you touch shitcoins: a shitty experience.
Fiat are all a bunch of shitcoins.
Buy real money and never go back.
I'm sorry, this doesn't address OPs issue with Kraken, but someone had to point this out.
Thanks to OP for warning us about Kraken's shitty practices.

Not if computing power increases faster than blockchain size. With Core, at least we have a chance - such that eventually, a farmer in rural China will be able to run a full node.
This is especially true if proposals of **reducing the block size** to 100 KB see the light of day.

What was the purpose of having a guarantor (KnC Group) if this guarantor served no useful purpose in the first place?
Are you planning on getting another guarantor instead of KnC Group?

How do you store your 20,000 bitcoins? Do you have proper security measures, including multi-signature distributed among multiple trusted but independent parties, in place (so that no one person can just steal the bitcoins)?

Trace Mayer explained it really well in this interview:  (Trace Mayer: "Bitcoin Core has No Real Competition")
After watching this interview, I fully understood why I'll probably never want to run anything other than Bitcoin Core. (Except for small amounts in mobile wallets.)

And I should believe this because ... somebody wrote about it online? (With links to some questionable sources.)
Sigh. Russia does this, Russia does that. Sweden does this, Sweden does that. Ukraine this, that. When will this end? People are so gullible IMO.
I'll believe it when I see it.
For now, I will work under the assumption that Ukraine is run by the post-Soviet oligarchs - like Russia (those who are in Putin's good graces).

After BIP-148 happens, will Pieter Wuille work on the BIP-148 chain or not? That's the essential here IMO.

Typical statist mindset.
We don't need a new pro-bitcoin "national policy"! What we need is a *non-policy* and the abolishing of other existing laws that may get in the way. Just leave people the hell alone!
