you don't HAVE to supply ID to any of them. It just removes the safeguards. Like on bitstamp, if you're unverified, you are limited to 1k EUR deposit on the first one.

Can see the anonymous side of bitcoin pulling in more, erm, entertaining businesses like these. Nothing to show up on the old bank credit card\statement. bonus

Not withdrawn yet, but I'd imagine it's the reverse of the deposit using transferwise.
Open a withdraw request with bitstamp, use the EUR account number that your request with transferwise gives you. They send the money to EUR so it will be converted. Once that's done, transfewise will swap it to GBR. 
If you did use Transferwise, let me know - I presumed it would not be an issue to get the cash back out.

The rising price of gold in the last few years has been due to global instability. That's a given. When 'paper' money is devalued, people move to physical mediums. The old adage of 'if the world ends, at least I can melt gold down into coins and trade them for goods'. When people are scared, they turn to trusted forms. Metal coins have been used for thousands of years. 
Not sure where the 'A store of value isn't a store of value if it isn't also used for something else' comes from. A store just needs to be something that everyone knows, accepts and is not infinite. All the gold on the planet can be held in a small arena. You can't make more.
As for poor countries becoming richer, those who love gold and wear it, i.e India. Most is passed down from family to family or through dowries

good luck

mining boat has sailed. It sailed last year for some, depending on which boat they chose. By the time some of the ASCIS batches come out, it will take a ROI of nearly a year. That's WITH known output. who's to know who's making chips and mining without going public. It only takes a venture to have enough capital to make the chips, after that it's better to use them to mine than sell them. The public ones are crowd funded as they had no startup capital.
Buying coins is easier by far. Transfer money to an exchange, do your analysis and but up a buy order. Then leave it. Don't chase the market or you will get burned
Good luck

The big unknown portion, I take it that's the solo miners not in a pool yeah? Wonder how much of that is being mined by a botnet

in Bitstamp, click on deposit and it will give you the info you need. make sure you put the red reference number in the ref field in TW, so they know it's your cash.
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:05:17
haha, hopefully I won't be withdrawing ;)
Cheers guys, I opened a mtgox account a while ago but it's taking forever to properly verify and that exchange is getting beasted. I'll crack on with bitstamp
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:18:43
When did TW say (it's in the email they send) that the money would be with Bitstamp? my TW transfer completed days ago, but it won't be with Bitstamp until 9am tomorrow morning

You need to do both at the same time
Sign up to Bitstamp (or any exchange). Go to deposit and it will give you an unique reference number (in red) as well as the exchange's bank details. You enter that info into TransferWise. Once TransferWise does the swap from GBR &gt; EUR, it's transferred to Bitstamp's account.
Hope that helps

I don't really follow your issue
TW use SEPA, a EU banking standard. If they go after anything it will be it's ability to SEND money to Bitstamp. If you have money in Bitstamp, you move it to Gox. If you then need to get cash into Gox, you use international wire. There's always a way. 
I do agree the exchanges are the main point of failure. It's always been a thorn in my paw and I spent a great deal of time getting over the fact that a decentralized currency has to use so few random, questionably controlled points to sale...
Ripple is.. well who knows. It's an interesting concept, but with the group holding 20% - I feel it flies in the face of Bitcoiners (exchanges withstanding), the very people it's trying to appeal too. A closed source VC driven machine to cash in on Crypto people under the rabid frenzy of what's going on now. It will be interesting to see what happens with it..
BTC is a gamble. LTC is the woods. Spending on Ripples before it's even out of beta is laying naked in the desert... 
Kettle is boiling. Chin-chin

Why not start the ball rolling and then post the petition, it's not too hard to open one. Sabre rattling with an idea is a bit pointless
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:20:09
Can you post the exchange rate you got from GBR &gt; EURO?
Since SEPA is only for true Eurozone countries. i.e EURO to EURO. I'm wondering if Barclays have given you a lower amount of Euro's at the other end, as a way of adding the fee.

For the UK
Move funds from GBR bank account to  (It's made by the people behind Skype, so it's easy to use and safe)
TransferWise then move the cash into their own UK account. Someone in the Eurozone who wants Sterling, does likewise. Once the process is complete, you get their Euro's and they get your GBR. Money does not go through a cash exchange, so you pay hardly anything. Fees are under £5 for for a £1k transfer. Transfer takes a day or two.
I then uploaded the cash to an exchange in the Eurozone.  are hosted in Slovenia and have a good rep. Trading is done in US, like all the exchanges, so there's a delay here of a few days waiting for it to be converted. They can also VERIFY YOUR ACCOUNT IN A DAY! I'm still waiting for MgTox verification after more than a week..

Bitstamp exchange rates (Corporate rates)
(When you open a deposit, it's in the blurb at the top of the page)
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:10:14
But that's a good thing no? the more people involved the better. BTC is only taking off because of more interest. If the only exchange was in the US and it was impossible to send funds from anywhere else, it's not going to thrive.
My main issues with BTC's are
Limited exchanges. The knowledge is there and so is the money; why are there no exchanges popping up in countries that are and have always been used to store cash.
The early adopters having such a massive market share and the fact that the few exchanges are geared and easily manipulated.
It's close to the perfect plan, if I was a conspiracy nut.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:01:42
Yes, you have to enter that in the reference box, otherwise when the cash goes into the exchange account, they will not know who's it is.
I had an email from Bitstamp last night saying it had cleared. Now the owner of some bitcoins :) Was fun deciding when to buy in. Did it early morning when the market was flat. Used a list order and waited for someone to fill it. Have fun
Oh, TW had said that the cash would not be with the exchange until 9am this morning, so the process was faster than I expected
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:18:50
You can put in ANY amount really. Once it gets to the exchange, the price will dictate what percentage of a bitcoin you get. i.e if you put in 50 and one BTC was 200 on the day, you'd get 0.25BTC's

according to the Wiki 
Bitstamp - Based in Slovenia. Deposits in EUR will be converted to USD
So you pay in Sterling, it's converted to Euro's by transfer, then they change it to US to trade. What a convuluted mess. When you withdraw, do they come back out as Euro's or GBR then? Euro's would not be my choice

Great post Knight
Greed.. It's human nature. Everyone wants to get ahead of the pack and get something for nothing. BTC is at It's current price due to massive speculation. It's never really going to be a free currency since it's linked to other fiat currencies. We get paid in US\GBR etc, so exchanges exist to allow people to transfer wealth into Bitcoin. For it to be truly free, we'd all have to get paid IN bitcoins. Then there's no need to check what BTC vs USD is, since were all using bitcoins. No government is going to allow large companies to do that. It simply won't happen. Anyone who believes that is kidding themselves.
A small country or state flipping the switch to BTC will be the only way we will see that happen.
Bitcoin WILL thrive on the net, that I can agree with - it's got a long way to go on that front. Seeing it as a day-to-day, in shop currency? replacing others as the sabre-rattlers keep saying.. hmm. Who's got time to use 2 currencies in normal life anyway. Plus it does not scale well. Shops with 'Ham sandwich, 0.00000012382 BTC' (if it, as some people suggest, gets to 1k and above - I can't see that happening either). Litecoins AND BTC could work maybe. LTC for smaller amounts, linked to bitcoins as it already is.
So what's going to happen? It will stagnate at set points. A ceiling price is found and then it stays just under. New investors won't buy in high. Eventually, someone with a large amount will cash in, drop the market, just to get it moving again. New people will buy in to speculate and so will the person who crashed the market. The circle keeps on going. Bubble after bubble.... 
It's the large initial holders of BTC's that can and will dictate.
Good luck to them

if you put in 50k, you'll not sleep well until you take them out. Be careful
Maybe put in 1k and see how it goes?
