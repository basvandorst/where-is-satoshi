Hey this is news to me, care to say which aspect of the project fails to be open source?
@_date: 2019-07-23 12:49:02
Mycelium is open source and pretty damn okay IMO
@_date: 2019-07-24 05:47:18
That's good to hear that's what I thought in terms of verified OS builds (which is perhaps all I care about in terms of how open source a project is).

The "Bitcoin weapon".. hah
Who has ever called it that.. what trash
@_date: 2019-03-19 12:42:27
It was borderline "okay" until about the 10:00 minute mark.. 
Then it became obvious it was just trash.
MIT funding having a sway over development? Lol..
Bringing up Andresen and the Bitcoin foundation?? I'm on your side on that.. or was in 2012.. it's 100% irrelevant now.
@_date: 2019-11-09 20:43:07
Can't wait to see more of this.

It's almost like the charts sometimes lie

What's reaching out to the donator going to do? You can't "reject" a bitcoin payment. Or did bitpay just assume that the donator would keep his old keys after donating and send it back to the same address.. either way rediculous and Amazon watch are half to blame here as well.
@_date: 2019-08-23 13:14:07
They took Bitcoin donations without an understanding of the technology. 
That, or they understand Bitcoin and still chose to have a custodial wallet with bitpay.
For a mom and pop establishment sure that's NBD, but for a charity trying to help an environmental disaster? That's a failure of due diligence.

99% of this article is (poorly written) political speculation. Maybe it's just lost in translation, or maybe it's propaganda
@_date: 2018-11-30 00:26:58
Get this trash off @_date: 2018-11-25 06:20:38
Oh you




@_date: 2019-09-04 15:28:27


Yes. [This chart]( would go from 0 to something much higher than that.
@_date: 2019-09-11 06:23:16
Yeah this is complete shit

$2k baby

No one knew who tf he was when he first showed up either.

A miner could just generate dummy transactions that are still valid with any fee rate they choose to fill the txcount.
It's a tough problem to solve, but I'm pretty sure someone smarter than me will solve it (if they haven't already)

How do I get people to give me negative interest loans? I gotta talk to my banker.
@_date: 2019-09-07 02:45:24


This is not a huge confusion, as the miners get to choose which transactions the nodes will validate. 


No, this is false. If a miner so chooses they can not include any transaction they dislike and the network has no means whatsoever of "rejecting" them for it. Blocks are only rejected from a node in the event that it includes an invalid transaction, breaks some other consensus (like blocksize), or is proven to be an orphan.
Their line of reasoning isn't necessarily invalid either. Miners do have "customers". Their customers are anyone who includes a transaction fee in a Bitcoin transaction. I'm not supporting this as it would turn Bitcoin into the most powerful spying/big data apparatus ever conceived but at least properly report on the situation instead of saying "they don't even know how it works". They do.
@_date: 2019-09-08 02:43:32




This would be implemented as a *whitelist* instead of as a *blacklist*. It's very easy to regulate and say that "it's illegal for a miner to include an unknown/non-KYC transaction". And due to the security of BTC instantly provable/prosecutable if a miner does.
Saying that EVERY miner has to agree to this is a little sanguine. For example, if China implemented this today, the effective bandwidth for (unknown) transactions on the block chain would go down more than 50%.
So maybe with enough lightening dev that is resilient, since if 1% of miners will include any transaction you can still open a channel after waiting long enough but It would still create a secondary fee market for psudoanonymous  transactions. All of these things are bad for Bitcoin.

Yeah, I've used Bitpay's and the Shiftcard. The shift card worked great (especially paired with something like bitwage) and I used it as a daily driver for a year or two until they shut down, I can only assume the coinbase card is the same.
Bitpay on the other hand, is fucking trash. You have to sell your BTC to load a balance on the card and use some stupid payment system for fee negotiation (this was years ago btw, it may have changed by now)

Kevin's alright

It's better thought of as a demonstration of Bitcoin's centralization than a threat to it. Those 70% of miners can't make the protocol any *more* centralised.. so they're not a threat to centralization itself. But they certainly can do some heinous shit (only allowing KYC transactions 70% of the time, for example).
Should you lose sleep over it? Probably not. Just stow away another pack of popcorn for the inevitable UASF that comes to defeat it.
This sort of attack is coming someday though and it's going to fail.

Unfortunately bitpay is not new, this bit of news doesn't bring us further than we were in what.. 2015?

Bullshit, don't mind the purists. Anything increasing the usability of your Bitcoin holdings is a good thing. Try telling my landlady to accept Bitcoin.
