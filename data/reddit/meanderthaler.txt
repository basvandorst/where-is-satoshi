It’s a country. With passport and all. It’s not even a country within a country (like Lesotho, for example) as it’s not surrounded by China, just has one landborder.

Two questions. Are you Japanese? Are you Satoshi?

You know, he’s using BTC as it was intended to be used. He even says that he doesn’t mind the ‘early adopter’ hassle. If there were many more people like him, so many more places would accept btc, and we could start using it properly as a day to day currency. As a fellow German, we do really care about privacy a lot, so that’s one good point(see for example the problems Google had with Street View in Germany, or why many or even most Germans still don’t have credit cards). And i fully agree with his points about the middle man...banks are ridiculous. I once had to take a very large sum out and couldn’t do it at once, despite me having ID on me and it supposedly being my money. They started asking questions what the money was for and so on. I know this is to avoid money laundering, but still... it felt strange as it’s my money!!

Yes point was that it could be the symbol! However, wasn’t aware of the unicode acceptance? What’s the story there??

And that Thai symbol on that key... is it the moon behind a hill?

Why not?

It might not be the most common thing, but yes, it does happen, as pointed out above in another comment (tried to take out large sum and had to do it over several days and answer strange questions re money laundering). Also, blocked payments: once abroad, which I’m a lot, cards get constantly blocked, even after calling in and telling the bank/credit card company where I am. 
Edit: not OP btw

Do you mean dilettante?

Yes! Who needs Fiat once bitcoin takes over

You single handedly convinced your local groceries to accept bitcoin? And that in ever so sceptical Germany? I’m intrigued!!
@_date: 2018-12-27 00:49:07
Haha good one! 
@_date: 2018-12-27 14:29:25
Nothing funny here
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:36:20
I think that’s pretty cool, well done and thanks for the effort!

You’re welcome! Thanks for your sarcasm
