I FOMOed way too many times in the past and lost on fees and buying back in, before realizing that if I just sit tight it should come back around. Have a stop limit set at 6250 to buy back in. If it goes up over 9.5k then I'll accept the loss and buy back in. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 18:33:16
Replace "$6k" with "$8k" or "$9k" or "$10k' and re-ask your question. 
I don't know what it will do, but the only way I am making money now on it is that I buy when it hits 6450 and sell when it hits 6200. Just been doing that over and over again the last two months.
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:52:23
Does anyone think now would be a good time to buy or does it likely have lower to fall?
@_date: 2018-09-21 12:17:33
You are *skeptical* that that will happen? Or are you saying you believe it will happen?
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:20:22
Bitcoin was at 8200 last month. Whose to say it won't go back up to 8200 and fall down again? This EMA doesn't mean jack. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 16:48:01
There is no way you can say bitcoin/altcoins are "commonly used" for payment. Grab 50 people on the street and ask them how many used bitcoin for payment within last 24 hours and you're lucky to find one.

All the downvoters from Friday when I said I was going to sell at 6700 and buy back in at 6200. Where are you now? It has been doing this same pattern for 2 months. If it goes up 5% in one day you sell. You don't sit and wait for it to possibly keep going up to 12%. Then when it drops down 5% in a day - you buy. 
I know no one can predict the price of bitcoin and it could do something crazy at any time, but this has been pretty consistent now and is an easy way to make money.

Not anytime soon. Been working great for the last two months. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:41:26
As today (and the past two months) shows, I sold high. Easy money.

This is some incel shit right here. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 14:14:17
Buy at 6500 and sell when it drops down to 6200. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2018-09-21 12:16:15
Just sold at 6700. Will buy back in at 6200. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2018-09-07 17:05:27
I'm confused by Coinbase Pro. I want to buy $1000 worth of bitcoin if the price reaches $6600 or higher, to ensure I don't miss an upswing. Do I set this up using a Buy Stop order, put $1000 in the Amount section, and then $6600 as the stop price? If so, it looks like it executes as a market. If I also go to advanced and set the Limit as $6600, it looks like there are no fees.
1. Is my understanding of the type of order correct?
2. What is the disadvantage to adding a $6600 limit? Just that the order might not fill at all if there isn't $1000 worth of bitcoins at that exact price? If so, should I change the limit to $6610?
@_date: 2018-05-11 23:47:33
I get what you're saying, but if 90% of the people want to talk about price, why discourage it just because *you* don't think that's what they should focus on? I understand your'e a mod so that's your prerogative, but obviously if price dominates discussion that is what is most important to people. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:00:30


You don't know this anymore than anyone else. Might as well be "6k soon."
@_date: 2018-05-11 10:57:19
Hard to take you seriously when last week you were absolutely sure it would be 12k by now and shit on anyone who said otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:41:46
Sold at $6550ish a couple weeks ago and now bought back in at $6207 and will sell again at 6500-6700. Easy money. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 19:37:43
Only 3 BTC, but it's enough to make about $800 every 10 days, for doing no work. It's not a 6k risk as I have stop limits set in so I don't lose too much if it goes crazy. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 19:38:38
My tax bill? Don't I only have to declare gains when I convert to FIAT?  
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:37:32
Yes, and I still made money since I just bought back in at 6200. Will do the same thing in another week or two. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:39:38
You're right on all points.

Okay how about now? Can I celebrate now?
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:38:56
I know I can't predict it, but I am gambling that it is going to keep these patters and so far it has for the last three months. I have made enough from buying low selling high that I have almost purchased an entire bitcoin from profits. 
@_date: 2019-08-08 17:35:27
Thank you very much. This is pretty much what I need to know. Looks like I need to file amended returns for 2017 and 2018, and put aside money for 2019. I appreciate it!
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:08:25
Thank you very much. This is making much more sense to me. I downloaded the Coinbase capital gain/loss report for my 2017 transactions and it looks like I moved some bitcoin I bought in 2013 as well as bitcoin I bought in 2017 to an Ethereum wallet. I have long term gains on those transactions of $272.46, and short term losses from what I bought in 2017 of ($106.40). I think you can deduct net losses of either type against the other, so I have to file an amended 2017 return and pay on long term capital gains of a total of $166.06 at 15% for a total of $24.91, right? It doesn't matter that in 2018 I then ultimately transferred all of that same bitcoin back to Coinbase Pro, and I just have to deal with that when I amend my 2018 return?
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:40:13
I do not ever see mass adoption unless energy prices decrease and we solve the climate change issues. How could you possibly have mass adoption when bitcoin consumes so much power to mine?
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:10:27
Does that mean I can pretty much ignore the coinbase gain/loss report, because in 2017 I never sold for FIAT, and all I did was transfer to my ethereum wallet?
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:38:45
Jesus christ thank god I got out at $10,800 yesterday after reading Coindesk. Will buy back in at $9500 and then sit on it for a few years.

Can anyone explain price action vs Baakt? For a year all I heard about in these discussions was "wait until Baakt comes!' and "Baakt is so close" and then Baakt is here and the price actually drops. Wtf.
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:40:25
Hasn't happened yet. And I'm to the point where now I am only going to do it with the profits I have made from day trading, so even if I lose it all it won't matter. 
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:13:34
Thank you for the advice. I guess I can probably go to H&amp;R Block and have them actually look at my returns. Just hate spending money on that because my total gain in 2017 was $166 and I had losses in 2018 of about $400, so it's such a small amount, but I definitely want to make sure I report correctly.
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:42:53
You honestly think bitcoin could increase 200% in two weeks? You must be trolling now.
@_date: 2019-08-07 19:59:49
Yeah but I'm not doing that. I'm buying gold, putting it in my safe, then taking it out of the safe and selling it to Steve for USD, then using that USD to buy more gold from Steve when the price drops, *then* moving that gold to my table.
@_date: 2019-08-07 17:46:42
Tax question:  If I buy 1 btc today at $11,700 then sell it on coinbase tomorrow at $12,000, then buy back in when it is $11,500 and transfer that entire amount to my hardware wallet, is that a capital gain that must be reported next year? Or do I only report gains ten years from now if I sell that bitcoin for USD?
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:48:18
99% of the comments in the Daily Discussion are people's thoughts on the price going up/down. You don't need to ask in a separate comment. Just read this thread.
@_date: 2019-08-07 18:08:06
Thank you very much for responding. Yes, US tax law. I think I understand. It only matters when I "bought" or "sold" on Coinbase Pro, and every time I did that, that is a taxable event I have to report. So I assume if next year I transfer that $11,500 worth of bitcoin back to Coinbase Pro when it is trading at $20,000 and then sell it when it is $20,050, I have a new capital gain. Is my cost basis on that gain $11,500, which means I owe taxes on a profit of $8,550? Or is my cost basis only the difference between the price of bitcoin at the time I transfer it to Coinbase, and the time I sell it for USD?
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:12:14
What if it goes up after the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:45:04
No, if you love bitcoin spend it and use it as currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:37:24
What does that mean? I'm asking if Reviken believes that the multiple agents that obtained the chat logs from the Silk Road's server mirror all colluded to create fake chat conversations where Ulbricht orders a hit on Friendly Chemist, and then there is a separate collusion involving Ulbricht ordering a hit from Force and Force and Green and the other agents colluding to create a fake hit? 
Or is it more likely that Ulbricht actually is guilty of murder for hire?

@_date: 2017-11-10 13:46:26
Of course it would be drastic, just like its jump from 5000 to 7400 was drastic. If it can go in one direction it can certainly go in the other.

A martyr? Are you saying you think he is innocent of trying to have a human being killed?
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:54:06
There were hundreds of investigators in this case. Two bad ones doesn't mean that Ulbricht is innocent. You would be looking at a pretty massive conspiracy involving a dozen law enforcement agents to overcome the mountain of evidence against Ulbricht.

If bitcoin hits 60k I'm putting in a sell limit at 50k. No way I'm letting it get down to 32k.

He was dumb enough to use his full name in his gmail address and tie that to a silk road handle. You think he wasn't dumb enough to leave something in a chat log? The chat log was on another computer, he wouldn't have a way to alter it through TorChat.

Quality post man. 
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:01:26
Would make more sense for people to put in sell orders at 9930 to try to jump ahead of the ones putting in at 10k.

You are not speculating. If you take out a mortgage, that mortgage requires an appraisal which is an evaluation of the value of the house.

I just got a Trezor so I did a test transfer of .01 BTC from GDAX to it. In my Trezor wallet, it shows one transaction on my account and when I view the details of it, it says  Total Input: **0.38108028 BTC and** Total Output: **0.38099216 BTC** and fees of **0.00008812 BTC**. What does that mean exactly? I see in the details it does show .01 BTC at the end, but why doesn't it show .01 output and .01 input? And am I paying that fee? Or are these numbers related to the confirmation and I don't pay any fee to transfer from GDAX to cold storage? Thanks!

No, don't move it to Coinbase. You don't control your  private keys there. That is the last thing you want to do. Look at Bitcoin Cash. If you had them in Electrum you would have access to it now. If in coinbase, you have to wait until January. Move it to electrum. There will be plenty of guides explaining how to recover them after the fork.

And a shittier title.

So you're saying someone knew your password as well as gaining access to your wallet? Did you use the same password for the cloud storage or did they hack multiple accounts of yours?

You create them when you create the electrum account and write them on a piece of paper and store that paper somewhere safe. I had no idea about private wallets until I read the FAQ and a guide on electrum. Took me about 1 hour of playing around with it and reading the guide to learn everything I needed. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:04:08
Thank you again! I also just found a few reddit threads that explained it more, and I opened a GDAX account. Will do some more research on it. I definitely like the idea of being able to place a desire purchase price and go to sleep, and hopefully GDAX purchases it at that price. I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:19:22


Okay so I was going to make a backup of the bitcoin file and store it my a relative, but instead of giving him a USB file, I really only need to give him a piece of paper with the 12 word seed on it, right? It doesn't matter if I have a hard drive failure and lose the wallet as long as I have that 12 word seed? And I guess it also doesn't matter if I ever forget the password for my electrum wallet as long as I can recover that seed?
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:24:44
I said I would need my seed phrase + password, not just the password. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:15:26
Ah, okay. So if I have the wallet file, I only need to enter my password, which decrypts the seed. But if I ever lose the wallet file, in order to recover it I am going to need that password plus the seed phrase, right?
I was thinking about making a backup of my wallet file and storing it with a relative, but I guess the only point to that is if I am worried about losing my security key? Do you guys all store your wallet files on your computers in plain sight?
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:12:15

@_date: 2017-10-23 22:49:41
Thanks for the quick reply. So I'm guessing on CB you buy at the rate coinbase sets, and on GDAX, you buy from whatever rate someone is willing to sell to you for? Do most *savy* buyers use an exchange like GDAX over purchasing on CB?
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:52:59
Same here my friend. It will drop again. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 13:48:58
is incorrect. If you are filing taxes in the US, the IRS has made it very clear and even publishes on their web site, that if you spend bitcoin on a purchase it is a taxable event and must be reported. If you buy bitcoin at $100, and then it goes up to $200 and you buy something for $200, you have to report $100 in capital gains taxes.
