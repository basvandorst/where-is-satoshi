On the checkout page of overstock I see the Bitcoin logo as a method next to Visa and the like but I don't see anywhere to click pay with bitcoin. Just some annoying form that I must fill billing address. This is starting to annoy me. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:44:10
You know I thought about doing this. I actually started out the process of starting a ghana Bitcoin meetup group then found out there's a small fee, which isn't really a problem. Was about to pay then I was thinking how would I set up the venue, possible additional costs threw me off I guess. I'm new here, I guess I should also ask how many active Ghanaian redditors there are. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 14:32:30
Tell them to go to the local bitcoin meetup

"It will do a man a thousand times more good to show him how to succeed than it will to tell him he needs charity. We need not listen to all the calamity howlers. Let them howl if it does them any good. The infinite has given us a power and we must use it. We can do more toward saving the world by proving this law than all that charity has ever given it."

I've said this before and I'll say it again. The general perception of bitcoin will begin to change only when and if the (Bitcoin to fiat dollar) value surpasses the all time inflated high of $1200 that it was once at. 
Think about it. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 13:03:49
I agree. I have an m7. Been more than a year now. Never been happier. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 14:53:11
I hate how almost every article has that stupid picture of a bunch of the cassascius coins. 
Because of this picture, I've actually heard someone explain to a few people that "you know they've issued actual coins now"  
I went on to explain that there is no "they" to issue anything. It just shows how misleading those pictures are. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 20:27:41
I've read articles by this guy before. He's been a pure hater since day 1.
Bitcoin probably goes against everything he's ever come to believe, so we can't blame him. It will be fun to rub it in his face in a few years but he'll most probably have changed his identity by then.

Thanks for your advice! However for number 2, I was asking more along the lines of purchasing a currency like litecoin using Bitcoins I already own. I see a plethora of exchanges but I'd rather prefer one that has some form of extra security measure like 2 factor authentication for example.

Quick question. Bitcoin loans would be measured in fiat right? Because if the value appreciates it would suck paying the whole btc amount back to the lender.

Because using satoshis is not practical as yet. People prefer using currencies with 2 decimal places like dollars and cents.
They prefer this on a psychological level; and it is one of the things holding adoption back at this point.

@_date: 2014-06-04 00:50:04
no you don't hate it, you just made stupid decisions by rushing into it. 
I researched Bitcoin for months on end without buying before I got into it. Even to the point where I was advised against trading at MtGox, way before the collapse.
Just buy and HODL, bro, and stop whining.

@_date: 2014-06-05 13:52:16
No matter where it comes out. The day after that there will be a torrent out. Maybe they're trying to get around that to ensure there's no piracy malleability... lol

I'd tap that 
@_date: 2014-09-10 08:11:14
I'm saying this because the skeptics that have heard about Bitcoin know that is was once at that price value. It's one of the main reasons people assume it was a failed experiment. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:04:48
It's still a good time IMO because the market cap is expected to grow exponentially. And Bitcoin is an inherently deflationary currency, so it's value must go up over time as flow of supply is near constant and limited, demand goes up. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:21:13
Do you know where I can find a collection of these?
