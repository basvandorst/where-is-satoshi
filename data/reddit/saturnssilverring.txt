with that logic, Coinbase would have also betrayed you on your forks.
Breadwallet (and as far as I know, ALL wallets) are not touching Bitcoin Gold because their code does not have replay protection (prevents double spending of bitcoins).  2x is also going to have some problems, as replay protection is not built in, so Coinbase will not give you the 2x on day 1.
Golden rule:  If you hold the private key, it's your BTC.  If someone else holds the private key, it's their BTC.   If you keep the BTC in Coinbase, they hold the private key.
TLDR: Storing BTC on Coinbase is the rookie move.  Storing BTC in your own wallet is the only way to be sure you get your "free coins" at the fork.

Hopefully someone can correct me if I'm wrong - BUT - 
Bitcoin ATM and LocalBitcoins are what you're going to have to use unless you decide to try to mine.  Also - some BTC ATMs do allow you to both buy and sell.
Once you have bitcoin in your wallet, you can spend it in places that accept it, or you can try to find an exchange that only does crypto and not fiat.  One complication to this (while it is unlikely) - the IRS could come after you if you are making gains by exchanging one type of crypto for another and not claiming it.

Years from now, this will be the American CEO Olive story.
Back in my day, Bitcoin was on the rise so much that if you put your payment for next month in today, you'd be able to keep paying me from that payment for the next 3 years.  (similar to $100 coffee story)

I don't think he's wrong -- many people are waiting to see what the market does after the 2x fork.

Shows how BTC may end up replacing the USD as the global  reserve currency.  Interesting.

GDAX.  Tons of info out there on how to do limit orders.
Coinbase has set up their system on two sides: 1) Coinbase - the rookie method with massive fees - which pay for that curated, easy to use approach as well as insurance and; 2) GDAX - the more professional trader approach with low/no fees at the trade.  (low fees for a market order, no fees for a limit order).
Seriously - do yourself a favor and search for info on how to do GDAX.  It looks scary, but it's not, and if you have a coinbase account, you already have a gdax account.

I'm more surprised by MLB in there.  The World Series is over.

Golden rule:  If you hold the private key, you hold the BTC.  If someone else (coinbase) holds the private key, they hold the BTC.
The fork is a copy of the ledger.  If you have your coins in a wallet that does not support 2x, and 2x ends up winning, then you should be able to transfer the coins to an updated 2x wallet and see those coins as it's still on the ledger as unspent.

FOMO is real, esp with 2x looming.
Just DCA if it allows you to sleep better at night.  If you have $7000 ready to go, buy $1000/wk for the next 7 weeks and ride the coaster.
(also recognize that DCA basically paying $ to limit risk, so it will perform worse if there is no dip)

Lots of people left their coins on coinbase for the btc cash fork -- market has not seen what the end result of this will be.  A few weeks ago, this sub thought it would tank the price to double digits or less.
The rise is probably people hedging their bets.

And it will make it beyond Uranus

Only you, or your magic 8 ball can decide.
It may go up, it may go down, 2x may end up being the superior coin -- no one knows.

Especially considering the (i'm guessing here) $1.99 fee.

Things you pretty much need a bank to do:
1) Securely hodl large sums of currency
2) Securely transfer large sums of currency
3) Loan out large sums of currency.
Things BTC allows you to do:
1) Securely hodl large sums of currency
2) Securely transfer large sums of currency
That's all they're referring to.

Losses and Gains are not real until you exchange.
What's your endgame?  10k?  1yr?  figure that out, then sleep better at night during the dips.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:39:10
Nope.  But I'll give you an upvote.

It's a weighted average of percentage of searches.  So, say that there are 1,000 people in Nigeria, and 2,000 people in South Africa.  Let's also say that 100 people in Nigeria searched for Bitcoin.  In order to have a 100, South Africa would need 200 searches for Bitcoin.  (The algorithm and base numbers will be different, but the concept is similar)

I'm a fan of Martin Luther King weekend in 2019 as a good dip before the 2020 rally.

The true lesson here is to HODL.
Buying at ATH - no big deal when the tide rises again.
Selling the dip after ATH from fear - giving money away.

Look at ethereum - it goes up, it goes down, but it seems to have a happy equilibrium at around $300 right now.
At this moment in time, Bitcoin is consistently moving up, but you could play this same game by looking at the all time price history and see what would happen if you invested on 2 random dates a few years ago.  It may climb, it may shrink, it may stay relatively flat for a few years.
Yes - if you look at the big picture, and pretend you held since 2009, you'll always be up.  Look at some of the other altcoins (bitcoin cash or neo maybe?) for examples of what could happen.
Fiat loses value over time, as it is inflationary.  Bitcoin is deflationary, and by design is supposed to hold or increase in value over time (assuming demand stays the same or increases).

Well, if he had enough to buy 5000 btc, and that goes up by $1000, then he manages to sell the 5000 btc without crashing the market -- he could have done it last week.
