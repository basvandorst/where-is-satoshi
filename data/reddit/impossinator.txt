Bitcoin and gold are like brothers.  Neither is "better" than the other, they're different and they compliment each other very nicely.  You don't have to choose.  If you're invested 100% in either you're making a mistake.  If you have one without the other, you're putting yourself at needless risk.
That having been said, USD is not an investment.  It's also a speculation, in a sense...  but it's a depreciating asset because it can be printed with impunity and without end.  Gold and Bitcoin are limited to what can be extracted, given a certain capital/energy outlay.  
Until war comes, of course, then the USD will appreciate somewhat because you can count on the yanks to make good on their promises.

Well...the jokers at GOX validated my JPY domestic bank account a couple weeks ago, and I transferred the proceeds from a couple sales (a mere 100,000 JPY, or a little less than $1000 US) on the 15th of this month...

A rational investor would stop accumulating after a while, and take some money off the table -- sell a third or half and recoup your original investment plus a healthy profit, and let the rest "ride for free".  Sounds like you're putting all your eggs in one basket and are a bit of a zealot.  That's unlikely to have a happy ending...

"*Unexpectedly*" ...?  Are you fucking serious?
Did you mopes really think China, which has serious fx controls in place and a managed, unconvertible currency, was going to allow bitcoin to trade freely?  Are you insane?  They have the "golden shield" "great firewall" and social censors;  They block websites and content and news from abroad that they don't like.  You thought they were going to officially or tacitly *embrace a quasi-financial instrument that would enable unlimited money laundering in a country with a nonconvertible currency, an immature and undersized bond market, a government-run joke of a stock market in Shanghai*, etc., etc.   For real?
This is a country that can't agree what happened at Tienanmen square, and you bought the notion that they were  going to embrace *bitcoin* and all the social change it can bring?   
Are you people for fucking real? 
If you thought that, or worse *bought* that...well...you thought wrong, kids.

Yes, the "greater fool theory" of valuation.  
Bitcoin has been pronouced dead on multiple occasions before, so it's premature to say this will kill it any more than Silk Road dying did, but it's hard to see how it can come back strong after this in the short term.  At least a new generation of "investors" know what counterparty risk means, and why a currency being "virtual" is *both* a good *and* "bad" characteristic, depending on the circumstances... 
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:07:46
I don't care.  I know the place because I live here.  Lovely people, if only they could be freed of the CCP.  That's all I hate, the CCP.  They've twisted the minds of a billion people, preach hatred of foreigners constantly, and are the most thin-skinned cunts on earth.  They're going to reap the whirlwind eventually because of what they've done, either through external war or internal instability.  It's inevitable.  
@_date: 2017-02-09 09:09:55
Mate, rare earth metals are everywhere, and they're not particularly rare.  The reason China mines most of the world supply is because the environmental damage done by refining them is enormous, and Chinese clearly don't care about their environment.  In fact, few Chinese people care a fig for common property, all they love is their own family and their own possessions.  
"So what if they ripped off the world" ...  Spoken like the child you clearly are.  
It matters for two reasons.  First, you can't innovate if you can't protect IP.  That's a fact, and the makeup of the Chinese economy bears this out perfectly.  Second, China's current batch of stolen tech required no discipline to discover, which means the way people employ it is slapdash, careless, and once the initial spurt of growth wears off (which is happening as I write this), this technology actually becomes a drag on society.  China doesn't *need* 20,000km of high speed rail.  It doesn't need anywhere near the number of office buildings it has.  And on and on.  
"Give it 20 years" you say.  Everyone on shaky ground says that.  Chinese research institutes are a global joke and will always remain that way so long as the communist party's position in society remains unchangeable.  I can't even believe people doubt this.  You can't have a world class scientific mindset if vast tracts of thought are forbidden.  It just doesn't work like that.  
But you're a kid, probably an Asian kid who's been fed bullshit your whole life.  I won't hold it against you.  
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:03:35
How do you figure?  China invented none of the technology.  Absolutely none.  Sure, we subcontract them to build some of it, but it's not like they contribute something essential.  
@_date: 2017-02-09 02:56:02
The land is "priceless"?  WTF does that mean?  Half the country is polluted beyond redemption.  
"They have started to gain some great minds?"  Based on what?  Their thoughts and media are policed by the world's most thin-skinned control freaks.  China had no space program until it purchased a Soyuz from Russia.  China had no high speed rail before it bought rolling stock from Japan and Germany.  China had no advanced manufacturing until the rest of the world came in and set up factories.  China still can't manufacture high performance jet engines despite decades of trying, and its scientists are still harping on about the genetic and cultural uniqueness of Chinese in a manner similar to what the Nazis were doing with their insane science and archaeology.  
The country is awash in fakes of all kinds, which betrays a deep rot at the core of intellectual life in China.  Innovation will never take hold, because innovators *who are not politically connected* are never protected, and end up getting ripped off by their so-called compatriots in China.  Only the politically connected can safely innovate... and that pool is too shallow and too prone to simply ape the West since they're the only ones who can generally speak English and travel abroad to study.  And what have they done to date?  They've ripped off the world, blind.  Baidu, Tencent, Xiaomi...  all carbon copies of western tech and methods, living in a protected bubble of control.  Name a single bloody thing that's a true Chinese innovation that the rest of the world has adopted in the last thousand years?  Bet you can't.  Oh yes, potstickers and special   But besides that... 
Great minds don't emerge from within systems as sick as China, and it truly is sick, sick with crushing political control, sick with crushing debt, sick with a culture of shortcuts, fakes, copies, and half-assery to a degree most people would not believe even if they saw it with their own eyes.  Take your "priceless" nonsense somewhere else.  I lived in China 3 years and live in HK now.  The number of "great minds" I've met who were Chinese I could count on one hand, and they *all* detested the Communist party cunts who are running the place into the ground.

Nobody cares, because this is simply another Chinese hot money bubble.  The authorities are closing off all avenues for capital flight they comprehend.  Bitcoin will get shut down somewhat in China eventually, like it was a a couple years ago.  This bubble will burst... 
@_date: 2016-06-17 15:25:30
As a vehicle for evading capital controls, temporarily, yes, maybe for a while longer.  
But when the cunts who run China want to stop something, they can stop it, at least within their own shitty borders.  I'm sure it will go higher, but I'm sure it will crash like it did the last time it spiked like this.  Best to sell high, and not try to ride the thing all the way to the top.  I sold a heap of coins I mined myself at $750.  Missed the top by about a couple hundred bucks, but missed the trough by way more.  Glad I cashed out when I did...  good luck mate

These idiots are playing you people.  Bitcoin is not "better" than gold.  Gold and Bitcoin should be **allies** and partners.  Gold is the physical instantiation of what Bitcoin proposes to be.

@_date: 2018-11-21 08:58:27


Well if that's the case then Satoshi dun fucked up.  Bitcoin is withering on the vine for several major and nearly-impossible-to-correct reasons: 
1 - Design of the protocol and bitcoin blockchain was badly flawed in multiple fundamental ways.  Poor scalability lead to performance problems and (unsurprisingly, given human nature in general) too much incentive to fork.  "Mining" started out as an act of communal stewardship over network integrity, but has turned into a total clusterfuck that's been captured by huge Ponzi players of questionable commitment to anything but their own short term profits.  A rigidly-enforced (at the protocol level) community of **small** miners eking out a tidy (but not obscene) profit whilst contributing to network security would have prevented this from happening. It probably would have prevented the bubble all on its own by preventing hype in general from swirling uselessly around bitcoin because nobody would be making crazy profits (allowing bitcoin's actual utility to be its selling point, not the insane appreciation/volatility...)    
2 - Bitcoin suffered terribly from the community's easy acceptance of the waves of cash that washed over the community, ignorantly and selfishly chasing the "next thing".  This money has done nothing of lasting value for either bitcoin itself or the community (although one could argue it has helped to advance blockchain tech a lot) except to make a handful of people wealthy and impoverish at least as many.  Bubbles suck, and this one was caused by selfishness and greed.  For all the lofty philosophical talk, this community sold its soul for a song.  
3 - The community also made the crucial and irrevocable mistake of giving a flying fuck what the "price" of a bitcoin was in U.S. dollars.  Once that line was crossed, there was no going back... bitcoin was compromised.  You don't "be your own bank" or imagine you're dealing with an alternative to fiat when you price your so-called alternative in fiat and crow about how much your so-called alternative has "appreciated".  If you care what the dollar price is of anything, it's an "alternative" to *nothing*.  
4- Lastly, as OP points out, this community turned its back on making bitcoin a viable medium of transaction, which would have been essential to its being more widely accepted.  You hoarded. You speculated.  You blew your first, best chance to change things.  
You fucked up.  Stick a fork in this thing -- bitcoin has been dead for a while to anyone who understands what it was, could have been, and how the chances of that happening now are slim and none, and Slim has left the building... 
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:13:35


You and millions of others... this is why it's dying.  It's dying because it blew its shot at becoming *ubiquitous*.  It is ubiquitous for some things...sports betting, porn, and drugs.  Yeehaw.  The currency of the future!

If you were convinced it could go no higher, would you begin to spend it?  Even then, I have my doubts you would.

"Build value"  
Give me a fucking break.  
Where is the value in volatility?  What causes volatility?  Take a wild guess.  
It's not value or anything related to value.
Bitcoin went into a bubble because the community was a.) inexperienced and b.) got greedy.  
Bubbles are signs of delusion and immaturity.  Now it's deflating, and you're still holding.

This is foolishness. 
Deflation only ultimately injures holders of debt instruments.  Everyone else's buying power goes up in a deflationary environment.  Productivity increases flow directly to the bottom-line, keeping healthy operations profitable.  But holders of *debt* get wiped out.  
People who own assets free and clear (cash included) love deflation.  
America experienced powerful productivity-generated deflation through much of the 19th century.

"back on track" ... don't make me laugh.  
The problem is too many of you people have begun to equate BTC's *value* with its *dollar* value.  The BTC ecosystem for regular payments is still tiny.  It's nowhere near ubiquitous.    
All crypto is hobbled as long as you even give a shit what it's dollar value is on a day to day basis.  You are owned by the banks, then.  You've been bought off.  Your gains are paid for by suckers chasing this thing even higher.  Not going to be too many more of them now.  Get ready for a real bloodbath and a fall back to parity with gold or lower...  
It's incredibly sad to see how this has turned out.  I was a miner back in 2010 thru 2015, when my GPU became useless.  Haven't done it since and sort of forgot about it when then dropped back below $800...  now I turn around and everyone's chasing appreciation instead of *using* BTC to buy non-illegal things, daily use stuff...damn near everyone who bought since the end of November has been bled white.
