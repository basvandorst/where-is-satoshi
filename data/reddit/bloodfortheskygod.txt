Don't promote BCash.

Definitely. Whitepaper should be updated with the new state of the art tech like SegWit and Lightning etc. It also defines btc as p2p electronic cash which is just wrong, should be gold instead of cash.

Yeah, of course he can spend his bitcoins, it's just he's chosing not to spend. The fact that he would pay a fee higher than the transacting amount for daily usage is irrelevant.

The community did that, it's called Bitcoin Cash. 


It's not 1MB vs 1TB blocks.
Indeed it is not. It's between a camp that wants to shove their layer two solutions down our throats and disallow even proposing a block size increase as a solution, and a camp that is motivated around bringing on chain scaling especially until l2 solutions are deployed and proven to work. 
The bigger block camp didn't make a proposal to suddenly increase the block size to 1gb. They said **at least** raise the block size enough to let the network continue to function. The other camp responded by rejecting this idea *completely* and offering their l2 solutions as the be all end all scaling solution to the problem. It's been how many years since they proposed it? Three? Four?

This is flawed thinking. The whole point of the chain split was that one side wanted bigger blocks, other side did not, so a split occured. Saying that Bitcoin Core can raise the block size is misinformation. Bitcoin did raise the block size in the form of Bitcoin Cash, so if the general consensus becomes that raising the block size and scaling on chain is the way to go, BCH simply becomes the BTC.

It's not anyone's code, but everybody's code, that's why it's called open source.

Most here don't know what block size is yet you claim they're against non consensual hardforks. Know the community you're engaging in.

What usecase is left for BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:50:12


It wouldn't actually. The reason the fork happened was that Bitcoin Core developers disagreed with scaling on chain and they pushed for scaling off chain as the only solution. The other side spesifically disagreed with disallowing scaling on chain. There is no reservation being made against layer two solutions. It's just that the other side also is very skeptical of LN actually working.

Now transfer it out of your wallet and experience the real fees.

Read what Satoshi said just after the part he quoted. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:00:44
Yeah, definitely. It's not like Bitcoin is a peer to peer electronic cash or anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:20:51
Yes, because everyone treats cash as a medium of exchange, not something to store so that it goes up in value and then sell it for some other currency.

["I consider BCH a legitimate contender for the bitcoin name. I consider bitcoin's *failure* to raise block sizes to keep fees reasonable to be a large \(non-consensual\) change to the "original plan", morally tantamount to a hard fork."](

this made me laugh out loudly. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:29:24
It's amazing how the users of one of the biggest open source project have no idea what open source is. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:26:52


Is this some sort of a joke?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:19:45


How relevant.


Bitcoin Cash exists because a disagreement emerged in the bitcoin community about scaling solutions. One side proposed an immediate block size increase to cope with the ever growing demand, the other wanted to wait for a better off chain scaling solution. This is as simple as that. No need to revision history. If you think BCH was the first attempt to actually raise the block size, then you are seriously misguided. The first attempt was actually in 2010 by Jeff Garzik. 
None of these things are actually about our topic however. The topic is that you as a claimed open source expert have no idea what open source means.
