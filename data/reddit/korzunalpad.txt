Once you have the Bitcoins all you got to do is transfer it to your wallet such as electrum or Bitcoin core, and then make your purchase. Good luck!
@_date: 2016-11-09 06:36:53
Try Indacoin

PayPal has been very useful for buyers but not for sellers. They give support to buyers more then sellers.
I sell some of my virtual items through PayPal with legit buyers.
Maybe you should consider switching to other payment methods then such as bank wire, western union,  web money, perfect money, Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin may be inconvenient for some buyers as they use long addresses and cannot send payment directly, where as in PayPal its your password and you pay. It is however the best option for sellers.

Setup a Bitcoin wallet in your computer, electrum is a good option. Tutorials are available on setting it up.
Once done, you can buy Bitcoins with CNY from :
- LocalBitcoins.com 
- OKCoin.com
- BTCC.com
Transfer the funds to your electrum wallet.
Sell Bitcoins using these exchanges :
- LocalBitcoins.com
- Bitsquare.io
- Bitquick.co
Coinbase is also a option for selling but they require documents and could also potentially freeze your account and your Bitcoins demanding plenty of questions. Many customers have reported this in this subreddit.
Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

Localbitcoins.com. p2p
bitsquare.io p2p
@_date: 2016-11-03 07:54:27
Use another exchange or a P2P exchange  such as bitsquare.io.
There have been many reports in this sub that people's coinbase accounts has been Freezed and coinbase does not at all want to care to reply.
@_date: 2016-11-08 05:27:47
P2P decentralized such as bitsquare.io
@_date: 2016-12-16 08:20:24
Use Bitsquare.io or Indacoin, no ID required
@_date: 2016-11-15 13:43:48
Move all your coins to a new wallet and it will be fine electrum is a good one
@_date: 2016-11-07 14:52:57
Just check this sub many people have had similar issues with Coinbase. Consider using another exchange or do P2P decentralized trading.
@_date: 2016-11-16 15:00:11
Localbitcoins.com P2P
bitsquare.io p2p
Indacoin (debit/credit card)
@_date: 2016-11-16 15:02:05
Coinbase always does this to their customers. Use other exchanges such as localbitcoins, bitsquare.io, Gemini.com and others. Keep your funds in a Wallet such as electrum 
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:43:08
Indacoin 
@_date: 2016-12-01 13:49:33
I haven't gotten it yet from the jaxx wallet neither the seed backup
@_date: 2016-12-16 08:16:48
Or alternatives such as bitsquare, mycelium, paxful, indacoin
@_date: 2016-12-16 08:18:59
Use Indacoin for Debit/Credit card purchases
@_date: 2016-11-19 06:16:55
They will because they have all information of customers who bought/sold Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-12-16 08:17:30
Bitsquare.io or Indacoin
@_date: 2016-11-01 08:52:01
Try Indacoin.
The fee is $2 or 4 percent , whichever is higher
@_date: 2016-09-09 09:52:46
Amazing Bitcoin story!
@_date: 2016-10-12 07:38:59
I've seen localbitcoins, maybe western union or local bank transfer would be a good idea for you.
@_date: 2016-10-16 15:20:16
Setup a Wallet on another platform, depending on your choice. Blockchain.info, electrum, Bitcoin core are good. You can use them to transfer your BTC from circle and then gamble
@_date: 2016-10-16 15:04:38
This is just overpriced and they want more profits. Bitcoin would be a more cheaper option to send money. It would also be faster
@_date: 2016-10-16 15:10:08
You can buy Bitcoin from coinbase and circle if you want, although coinbase requires identification, not sure about circle. If you don't wanna give identification then Indacoin shall be fine. This is for debit/credit cards.
@_date: 2016-10-16 15:43:05
Yes that is because their fee is 4% or 2$ minimum. So you would have to buy 50 USD and you then would get 48 if I'm not wrong.
@_date: 2016-10-31 08:22:25
Wirex should be a good choice for you. Virtual and physical card available
@_date: 2016-10-12 07:34:18
Use Indacoin you can buy from there instead the fees are about 4%
@_date: 2016-10-20 09:53:23
Don't use coinbase as these issues are very common. Use another exchange
@_date: 2016-10-16 15:19:06
Indacoin is good, you can use ur CC/Debit Card with it. 4% fees. 
Correct me if I'm wrong
