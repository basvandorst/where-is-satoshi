He also thought the main point of cryptocurrencies is the fact that they are anonymous (which they aren't) and didn't seem to understand at all that the main point in fact is the combination of the system being 1. secure 2. decentralized (no single point of authority) 3. able to find a consensus regardless. Those three things combined is what has never been done before and why Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies matter.

It's not important, because if the merchant doesn't send your product then he's comitting a crime. At that point you've already left the area of "payment systems" and entered the area "legal affairs", you go to the police and/or to a lawyer. Sure, having a method for chargeback is more comfortable, but a serious merchant isn't going to require you to go the legal route in the first place because bad reputation means he will go out of business. So I don't think it's a huge deal.
A lot of EU countries don't do online business by credit card, they use SEPA bank transfer which also doesn't have a chargeback, so that pretty much proves the point that it would work just the same with Bitcoin.
