In what context do you think you've heard that phrase? A movie with  2 inmates in a federal prison, one of them takes drugs with promise to pay it back soon while the other is hesitant of this.  Then the barrower says "Word is Born!".  At which point he restores their broken civilization and a means of communication has been recreated...

I believe its a matter of introducing Bitcoin into these tried and true methods that drew success to other marketplaces as well as bringing Bitcoin further into the manufacturing world.
The concept isnt new per say, but instead of the business model working off of gold backed/fiat currency, its adding increased benefits garnered from cryptocurrency.

Delusional paranoia has little positive benefits on others.  He is after all a serial liar and tends to think everybody wants to get him, fleeing belize from police wanting to question him over a murder, to guatemala.  Just google the guy.  
IMHO he's the kind of person that would only create a negative focal point to the public in regards to cryptocurrency.  We didnt forget about that whole drug manufacturing and unlicensed weapon snafu in belize did we?

Good to know gifts filled with mystery went pretty "meh" with your family.  Very quantifiable. 
Good on the link however.  That on the contrary offers an answer to one of OPs questions.
Still chuckling to myself imagining a young man or woman getting handed a piece of paper from the eccentric uncle for Christmas, being told of its life changing implications. Remaining polite but not sure what to make of this gift. Theres gotta be a better way to get your family to be happy and enthusiastic about receiving money....

Isnt this a little backwards.  To be online requires internet.  Just like bitcoin requires the blockchain.  Seems as if the blockchain could have existed without the currency, but the currency relies on the chain. 
Granted there would be no incentive to drive network power.

What the fuck is the point of writing if you dont give a damn about your audience.   Even if money is all you care about it goes hand in hand with readers.  Which therein lies the final question, whats the point of airing your side of the situation if not to sway reader opinion.

Im seeing lots of alterior uses for the blockchain so it seemed as if the blockchain could indeed exist without bitcoin, or at least thats what i was attempting to describe.  I am in no way well versed in the system, so i wholly appreciate the clarification and any further clarification as well.

VM it,  start learning.  If u use a smartphone its linux based,  both Android and IOS,  theres just different mechanisms of interacting with the kernel. Same with distributions and window managers.  Hell OSX is pretty much nix.   You have more "experience" than you realize.   Get a VM gong and fuck around.  It wont hurt, only help you understand how many of the devices we use daily actually work....

only when someone writes "ID" or "show/ask for ID" on the signature field on the back of the card, even then only about 40% or less of merchants will request photo ID.  This also technically renders the card void (according to most large credit card company's terms) but this almost never enforced. 
I suggest you look into PCI-DSS compliance  to give you a better idea as to how merchants need to complete secure transactions as well as how card data is to be stored encrypted whether its long term or merely the data transfer from POS station to the payment processor.  
All that being said, and the mild tangent I went on, you'll almost never be asked to show ID for small purchases like food.   Large purchases however are a different story and ID verification is based on store policy moreso than PCI regulation.  Even then however many brick and mortar stores wont ask, and online merchants will rarely ask for further verification relying on billing address and shipping address matching as well as the name on the card matching the shipping details.

You need to enable header details through your account settings.  It can offer some good info but generally unless they are sending via an open relay smtp or similar it wont yield much useable info to unveil the jackass.

If obtaining a clean version is an issue for you theres many ways to work around that.  Either by completely separate workstation w no wallets, a vm, or ya know,  up to date AV since the heuristic signature would be everywhere.
If you dont verify yourself ultimately your just taking another persons word for it without verification.   Slippery slope.

If one is opening a shop, they got bigger problems to worry about if the difference between 1$ and 6$-7$ is gonna make or break them.
It furthermore shows how serious  merchants are if they deem it unnecessary to put in investment to get a return.  My fear is you are only going to foster merchants that will half ass their store, effort, and interaction with potential customers.
