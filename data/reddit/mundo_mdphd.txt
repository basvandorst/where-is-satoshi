Why wouldn't it be a good idea?

Likely referring to double spends against satoshi dice that may or may not have been done by the GHash operators or some hacker.

Given the context of the thread, I think it's already implied that not everyone should migrate to the same pool.

Personally, I think it would pretty messed up to discriminate against a pool because of the operators religion...

There are some great Khan academy videos about bitcoin on YouTube that I think would be very beneficial to you.

Doesn't get more real than the trillions of dollars of debt backing the USD right?

If you send an unencrypted wallet over the internet at all you should probably never use it again though.
Just a heads up

One of the main premises of Bitcoin is that you should be unable to determine the private key just by knowing a public address. If this is the result of a typo then there's about a 99.9999% chance that no one owns that address yet and you sent them out into space. If this is the case you are completely fucked.
If you sent them to some address you have saved rather than your cold storage then idk maybe there's hope if you remember the person associated with that address but even then they would have to willingly send them back to you.

Reading this it looks you're hung up because of the difference in scale between your respective examples. 
Maybe think of it this way. If I have a plumbing problem I'm going to spend the money to keep my house from flooding with shit today; regardless of what I think my money is going to be worth in 5 years if I hold on to it. Likewise, that demand creates a lucrative opportunity for people to invest in shit pipe supplying companies or shit pipe servicing companies. 
Essentially, deflation doesn't necessarily lock up an economy because people need stuff.
