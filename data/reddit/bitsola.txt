Sorry for the delay. Much better for someone unfamiliar with the application and wants to learn. Thanks a lot!

Your concept will be huge some day. This is just like going to Goodwill, making a purchase, and when they ask if you would like to donate your each change to the roundest dollar, you say, yeah sure why not. People will have no problem adopting this in the future - once the masses have been accustomed to and understand bitcoin. You've developed a sweet application.
Your demo goes a little too quick to really understand what is going on. But, the design looks great.

The wonderful things you can do with bitcoin... Merry Christmas good sir!

Ha, fair enough. Thankfully accepting a ChangeTip is pretty straightforward.

Love the idea. I condensed the URL and updated the link from my original post but I'm not sure how to make it any smaller: 
If you have any other suggestions, I'm all ears.

Whoa, thank you very much (and to the others too)! I was not expecting that. That is very generous of you and I'm glad you appreciate it!

Are there any other apps on the iTunes store that allows bitcoin buying and selling or is this the first allowed (assuming it is allowed as I know other companies had their apps pulled)?
@_date: 2014-11-18 21:46:24
Awesome, thanks for the answer. Much appreciated.

You might find this interesting. It's a collage of the  tips of the night: 
You'll probably find this website useful as well. Over $4,000 was tipped on the 26th:

I'm very impressed. You have a beautiful website. Very well done.
@_date: 2014-11-18 22:31:02
Appreciate the kind words! ;)

.30 * .01 = fee of $.003 
AKA less than a penny. Hope that doesn't break the bank ;)

It's good. It's treated exactly how it should be treated; exactly the same as normal currency (dollars). If you make payment in dollars for a product, you will pay a sales tax. If you pay with "convertible virtual currency," you will pay a sales tax. Providing clarity regarding taxation is definitely positive, especially since it's being treated properly.
If you want to review the IRS tax law regarding "convertible digital currency" go here:

If you already have bitcoin and are comfortable using bitcoin, then ChangeTip may not seem that amazing to you. The beauty of ChangeTip is the fact that it operates within a framework that people are comfortable with (Youtube, Twitter, Reddit, etc) and it's opening the door of bitcoin to an endless amount of new users. If you're a fan of bitcoin and would like to see widespread adoption, it's hard not to like ChangeTip. Just think about how many new users it has the potential of reaching within the social media networks.

Yup, pretty sure the feature I've described hasn't been developed as a wordpress plugin for the masses yet. Unfortunately, I don't have the know-how quite yet and I want to create something of my own before I would be comfortable developing something like this.

A great tool that will be one of the first interactions that people will have with bitcoin - and a positive one at that. "Hello free money!"
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:59:15
I wish you luck! Message me if you would like to spitball ideas.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:58:39
I'm sure there are ways to make this happen, but I think it would be extremely beneficial for the gobs of wordpress users to use this feature.

I don't use bitstamp. I just think it's a valid question that needs to be addressed.

Likewise with Charles Schwab (listed, but not activated yet)

Blizzard is good at making money with it's millions of users and subscriptions. Why wouldn't they want to decrease one of their unnecessary costs (Credit card fees) if they can get the same dollar value on the sale? Their core demographic (age group and type of users) is perfect for accepting bitcoin. From a financial standpoint, it makes sense.
