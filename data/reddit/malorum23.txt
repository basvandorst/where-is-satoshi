Okay but what for? Because of how bogged down it is? I didn’t need the transaction to go through immediately but saw no where to adjust fees. 
If so, what can I do in the future to not get charged so much when I try to buy? 10 or 20% fees I can understand... even 30% if I need it rushed, but  97% is so insane that it’s not worth it. I imagine lots of other people just starting are in a similar position...

I have seen local bitcoins. Have you had success meeting up with people? Are the fees much lower?

I can’t find an ATM that sells BCH, where would I find one of those?

Okay. I haven’t tried either of these yet. I will look into them, thanks!

Where do you suggest opening an account at? What are the most intuitive exchanges for beginners? Or which one has the most direct and straight forward directions on use?

USA :/ 
Can you buy on coinbase and send it to a non-coinbase wallet? I want to keep access to my private keys

About an hour ago. The transaction went through insanely quickly, which I understand is usually the result of higher fees, however 97% is ridiculous! 
Any suggestions on what I could do differently? Every online service I’ve looked at so far has had so many hurdles to jump through that I just get lost (even after trying to follow the instructions!) or the fees are so astronomically high it doesn’t seem worth it.

Yes! The price was at 5800ish on my ticker and it was selling for 6400+. I figured that was already adjusted for fees... boy was I wrong!
