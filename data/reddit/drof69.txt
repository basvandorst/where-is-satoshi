hehe.. then I'll take them from behind ;)
My favorite lyric right now.
"It has to start somewhere It has to start sometime. What better place than here, what better time than now?"

The tried. I'll give them a B+ for effort.

Honestly, there should be no reason to compare Botswana to Western culture. Each region has their own unique way of doing things. We may not understand it in the West but that doesn't mean that it's wrong. I think a question for the Bitcoin community is how do we help developing nations utilize Bitcoin to aid in self determination? 
It's hard not be disgusted with the way people approach the issue because Western influence has already played a major role in keeping poor nations poor. We figure that since we're in the 21st century that the pains of 18-20th century imperialism have no influence on society today. I believe that is wrong. I'm not an expert, though, so who am I to say anything right?

Question. If this was a hard cash foundation would it be an issue?

My prediction is BTC &gt;3000 by June.
@_date: 2014-01-21 02:43:38
I'll have to look into that. I'm still new to Bitcoins and have only recently been grinding the wheels in my head trying to think of ways to get in on Bitcoins while they're still profitable. After the December crash and the fairly good recovery, along with all of these new sites saying that they'll accept Bitcoins as payment, I think it's a good time to get started.

The name of the young woman who wrote this is very important.

I can see that you're just jumping all over the place providing useful information for everyone! You're such a help the Bitcoin community!
@_date: 2014-02-15 23:36:46
Why not? Cell phones aren't exactly rare. 
Edit: I like the idea of setting up cloud mining for villages who need help. How do we remain culturally sensitive though? I don't want to change the way people live if they don't ask for the help.

This is great! I know where I'll be booking business trip hotel reservations if I ever take a trip!

The problem is that people only hear the negative from the news like the Silk Road; therefore, they associate those of us involved in Bitcoin and other currencies with scammers and criminals. That's part of the reason it's so amazing working with the Quantum Leap Foundation because the whole goal is spreading crypto and helping people with complete transparency. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:08:45
Is really is. lol. Hardcore mining there. I just don't get reddit sometimes. So random of what people love and hate. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 04:32:33
No? Explain. It's an economy. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 06:38:35
Hmmm.. interesting. I mean, it's done with E-Cigs which don't seem like the most legit/legal business. I can't imagine everyone who's buying and selling Bitcoins is doing it under the table. Isn't the idea to make it a legitimate currency? I have no problem paying taxes on earnings. I'm not sure about the details of having to register your average E-Cig cart or Cell Phone Case cart at the mall. I'll have to do the research to see what kind of difficulties I'd face. All of the input is very insightful.

This was two weeks ago. The promise was to ship in 1 week when no units had shipped yet.  They were taken down shortly after I called them.

Just a note: I personally know the person in charge of this. It is a legitimate cause. Any questions can be directed toward me if you need proof before donating.

Honestly,  I think this is the start of the image change we need for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 02:36:37
I have an ulterior motive. I want to get a TerraMiner™ IV – 2TH/s rig and I don't have room in my house for it. I have some financial backing and I was thinking if something like this could possibly work out, with relatively low startup costs, I could do my mining and buy/selling at the same time. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:06:53
lol, this was made by Reuters, not bitcoiners. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 03:37:04
 this video gives an easy explanation about how it works. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:51:35
Bitcoin kind of has poor image right now. I'd like to change that, but the interest for projects like Example Africa just aren't there right now. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:13:38
Did you read it? I bet you didn't. I didn't just replace the word bitcoin with cash. If that's what you're getting at. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:50:39
I see what you mean. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:11:15
Dogecoin is missing :/
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:57:36
Thank you for doing me the honor of coming and posting on this thread Mrs. Itireleng. Your group is an inspiration to me personally. I had a long conversation with Steven about the Quantum Leap Foundation and I want to help out in any way that I can. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 02:14:51
Check my post history. I tend to help those in need. If you don't believe me give me a call and I'll talk to you in person. I'll message you my phone number if you'd like and the number of the person in charge at Salt City Miners. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:23:49
Someone knows something we don't know eh?
Edit: Person who made it probably Googled

Please drop more! Must buy 100 BTC today.

Oh yes. If you check out Bitconfused.org you'll see our doge campaign in the works.
@_date: 2014-02-16 04:00:04
No, I'm not actually. Roya Mahboob is also with me. Steven Carpenter, and Alah MotherPk Itireleng as well. 
Edit: You see, we work in the background while others make noise. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 03:43:15
And that is the norm I seek to destroy. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 01:11:13
I'm just getting familiar with the Quantum Leap Foundation, but I read on their page that Botswana is the 3rd most... what is it, unequal country in the world for disparity between rich and poor, I believe. I'll have to double check that point. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 14:55:09
hehe... now why is this not bigger news? Even if it's old news. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:05:07
Mrs. Alah MotherPk Itireleng  is the reason that I'm currently becoming an active part of the Quantum Leap Foundation. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 15:10:56
Yeah, I'm really appreciating reddit right now. The research based on some of the links people have posted will save my ass. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 06:05:49
That's kind of the idea.
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:40:20
They should really add gyft.com and Film Annex, big names there. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 23:14:17
The Foundation I'm volunteering with, the Quantum Leap Foundation Inc, was approached by her foundation two days ago. They want to do an documentary about the Bitcoin Botswana group we've been working with.
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:44:52
Bitcoin Botswana is amazing. They're so passionate about helping people. That's really the key to the success of Bitcoin. We're going to work very hard to help them succeed.

What can I say, you're a realist and I'm a dreamer.

No money put forward yet, I have a week to do a wire transfer. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:42:14
Does it? The US government holds a large amount of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-01-22 05:36:03
Thank you. I want to invest in crypto currency; however, I think I may have jumped the gun here and I don't want to go in over my head. It's basically an investment between 5 members of my family so we'd like to break even at least. I think it's a good opportunity, but you're right, I need to be willing to risk the investment and I'm not sure if I want to risk that much at this point. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 06:05:34
I don't get how it's different than these people who are selling "face-to-face" online? Why would I need licensing if I'm trading through a website?
Edit: Essentially it would be doing the same thing as say localbitcoins.com, I'd just have a kiosk set up to do it in a centralized location.
@_date: 2014-02-03 03:17:14
I saw a couple of these on ebay and gave Cointerra a call asking about them. They told me anyone posting at the time was trying scam people because none of the units had shipped yet. Gotta be careful. There was a "company" in IL saying the had them for sale also. Lots of scammers out there. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 12:17:43
I don't even get why the different coin communities have trouble with each other. We mostly all have the same goals. I've seen posts on that were totally legitimate calls for help and go unnoticed. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:41:21
It's nice to see the negative feedback. Actually gives me more assurance that I'm doing the right thing despite no one noticing right now 
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:38:07
It's basically Christmas for me right now. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:12:15
I've been in contact with Mrs. Itireleng. Their group is very excited to be able to do this. It's great to see the people of the world connecting through Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:55:23
Looks like Reuters needs to do some fact checking..... 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:35:28
I feel your pain. I had 7 bitcoins and sold almost all of them in 2014. I had like .4 BTC left and sold that when it hit 1800 :(
