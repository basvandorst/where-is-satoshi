You’ll be enquired to provide evidence of losses. Such task is not as easy with multi exchange transactions and missing cost bases. So yeah they can destroy your life if they wanted to no matter how big or small your account.

@_date: 2018-05-31 01:14:18
Valid point but not all retail investors are traders. And if you do without education you’re just gambling and being emo. It’s a zero sum game. There’s looser for there to be winners. And if institution money flows after retail invested then were winners if we just hodle. The dot com crash had retail investors joining in later that screwed them up. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 01:50:37
Stopped listening to annoying tone. Lol 
@_date: 2018-05-25 14:26:20

There needs salty retail investors out of the market for the next bull run, many would speculate as a bubble. The perspective i stand as an early investor is that if bitcoin the free market of self sustaining monetary finance. I believe in this to succeed for us people to prosper over the current dominant institutions that control majority of the worlds economics. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:11:25
@_date: 2018-05-09 14:22:48
Im more bullish on the speakers on the conference about supply chain and platforms. Thats where institutional investments will go into. Thats just my bet, since the local big businesses like telcos, insurance companies are experimenting with blockchain 
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:46:02
The ico is a bubble of speculative investment for 100x returns and people want this as its a easy way to get in early and market it on Twitter and YouTube. If it wasn’t for the ico’s btc would be 3x today at least 
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:40:38
It’s definitely not this cuntt craig and his bch as crew
@_date: 2018-05-09 00:57:38
Look seriously Bcash trashed Bitcoin and created a joke for the crypto community absolute sabotager. But Roger makes a fine point too. Bitcoin fuked up in December. So i don't know guys some dark shit is going on that we are not awre of fully.
@_date: 2018-05-01 09:49:26
Jamie deamond did the same. Crooks
@_date: 2018-05-25 03:56:10
No its *your
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:34:52
Bitcoin will be controlled by x. Privacy coins will replace btc as the free market currency.
@_date: 2018-05-31 01:15:45
And right now if those retail investors exit the game, thats when institutions will come back in buying it up, then the herd will follow and thats the next bubble. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:37:56
You’re referring to a specific segment that is a small relevance. Majority of users are speculative investors that react on price movements. And the rest small segment are holders because they foresee a bigger perspective. In the coming days and months will differentiate looser and investors, period. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:21:52
If its only the USD then ofcourse BTC will increase in value enormously! Because BTC is a global currency that’s interconnected with every other fiat transaction. But if its a global collapse then different story everything will he cheap

Haha some advice if i may, from a ux person the persona you have there are elderly with maybe less financial knowledge than our parents generation. So you’ll loose their interest in 5seconss after looking at your face thinking wtf im dying. I would recommend maybe an analogy to farming ecosystems and use money as the currency for value transfer and introduce internet network. Just a thought. Testing and feedback. Don’t argue with granny ok.

Omg the media fake media crap media, people are sick of hearing etf and sec. they’re not good for us the peer to peer users anyway. In effect it could create a bigger bubble and rekt havoc. But BTC will survive i just hope retail investors do too.

Guys don’t put people down for when people came to btc or how much btc they have made. The idea is for everyone to get involved in btc.
