We have actually been accepting Bitcoin for a while now, since March of last year. Just let me know if you have any questions about our services.

Yep! That's us! I can get us setup right now with a shared account, we have a new shared cluster we just setup that doesn't have any clients on it. It's more than powerful enough until we get a dedicated server setup for this.
I will message you. Let me know if you find a great domain name.

We are actually running a killer promo this year. $2 Domain names and 50% off all of our plans. 
Thanks again Bitcoin Black Friday team! You guys rock, I wish we could have sponsored the event this year but we got the news too late. (Our fault)

We actually have severs in both Canada and the US. The US definitely has its advantages. We are a Canadian company and we wish we could keep all of our infrastructure in Canada but the reality is that we get triple the bandwidth, double the power, better peering for 1/2 of the cost in a US data center which has allowed us to provide more for our clients and move costs to other things such as staff.
We haven't directly been affected by the NSA spying, we have never gotten a request from them or had any of our servers tampered with. We are also a relatively small company so we haven't been a real target.

We use Bitpay as it integrates with our billing scripts really well and they do have a 15 minute timer once the invoice is created. Even if the Bitcoins are paid after that timer we get a payment notification and I can just approve the invoice for you anyways.

It would be our pleasure to host the new wiki! Let me know what you guys need and we can set something up!
Best regards,

I think it's more than just branding. They have to see interest. Techies like to think in terms of specs, efficiency etc. so bitcoin is a no brainer platform in our eyes with low fees and no charge backs but if there is no interest to use it, it's pretty much useless. 
Small businesses don't mind giving credit card companies a cut out of their revenues since there is a clear demand for accepting credit cards and it visibly increases their revenue. 
If you want more merchants to accept Bitcoin, every time you step in a store ask if they accept Bitcoin. They eventually will. They will want to search it up themselves and they will find a way to accept it.

Hey, 
This is Matt from Hosterbox. Daniel here opened a support ticket and sent us this reddit post. I rushed over and as a personal advocate of Bitcoin I hate to see things like this happen. Although we can't expose the clients personal information we would like to help in any way we can. 
I have suspended the users account for now as this is against our TOS. 
Let me know if there is anything else I can do.
Best regards,
-Matt
