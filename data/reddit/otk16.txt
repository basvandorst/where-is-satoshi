That argument is true for any country/region in the world except for Puerto Rico, which has a special exemption when it comes to US taxes.
If a Puerto Rico resident has been resident for the whole year and has no income from outside of Puerto Rico there's no federal income tax to pay:  And yes - this includes US citizens as all Puerto Rico "citizens" have US citizenship.

SegWit won't fix the mempool issues. At best it's a temporary mitigation, but without block size increase the fees will continue to rise.

Who do you think is going to pay the miners if the block reward continues to decrease and if the number of transactions per block gets artificially throttled?
How is LN going to help you if opening/closing a channel will cost a few thousand dollars (or more) for an on-chain transaction?
The only benefit of small blocks is keeping the network more decentralized by allowing full nodes without lots of bandwidth to participate in the network. What do you think would be the motivation behind running such a node, if the operator is outpriced and can't send any coins because transaction fees are too high?

The one feature how ETrade could differentiate itself from Coinbase and other companies is by allowing the purchase of cryptocurrencies in 401k and IRA accounts.

Who are those people who can't afford a decent hardware, but at the same time are happy to pay a $50 fee on each of their transactions?
Running a full node isn't really that useful if you can't afford the transaction fees. The users you're talking about would be better of using a SPV client on large blocks and with low transaction fees.

It might be volatile but at least I don't have to pay a fortune in transaction fees. Is there any working plan to fix the fee issue for BTC in the near-term future?

Why would I buy from a centralized exchange/broker when there are lots of other coins that have larger block sizes and allow for decentralized transactions.
While the devs decide what ends up in the code base it's the users who decide what to use. And if there isn't a solution available soon users are just going to walk away and start using another alternative.

If downloading 250 GB takes a week this implies that your internet connection is quite slow with 3.3 mbps. Cases such as this are covered in the [whitepaper]( - see the section about Simplified Payment Verification.
Satoshi's original goal was to only have a few well connected full nodes that are able to handle the load. Users themselves would run simpler SPV nodes instead:


I'd recommend to use a light-client such as Electrum instead of running a full node.

What's not possible about it? The whole economic model depends on the assumption that the transaction fees will eventually replace the block reward. If you don't scale the block size upwards this implies that you will end up with prohibitively expensive transaction fees.

I tried out Lightning a few weeks ago to see how well it works as alternative to bcash (which is currently my preferred chain due to low transaction fees). Unfortunately Lightning has been a nightmare so far:
1) I have 1-2 outgoing transactions per month. Bitrefill guarantees that payment channels stay open for 30 days. So one payment channel can be used for 1 or 2 transactions and the per-transaction cost is even more expensive than raw Bitcoin transactions (due to fees for opening/closing the channel).
2) Receiving transactions via Lightning is insanely expensive: I receive more coins than I spend (see Reddit history for details) and with Lightning I'd need to buy an incoming channel at Bitrefill. Those fees are something like 4% of the channel capacity on top of the regular transaction fees. It would be cheaper to process regular credit card payments.
I've been a Bitcoin user since 2010 and technology-wise I never had a worse outlook than now. Lightning is a dead-end and will provide zero-benefit to users who only use Bitcoin occasionally (the majority of users at this point). In the near-future we expect transaction fees to replace block rewards, but due to the tiny block size this implies that even higher fees are required. Bitcoin needs to scale up or otherwise it'll be and altcoin soon. There's zero benefit in "keeping the network distributed" if the network is dead.

I didn't mean the price but the fees. Not planning to pay $2 in fees just to buy a $2 donut. And while Lightning implementations are a great early tech preview, they're at least a decade away from being actual useful (assuming that all of the open issues can be solved).
@_date: 2019-05-25 10:07:09
For which you spent $31.45 to add it (including the fees). That's nearly 12% in fees - pretty much any other payment method is cheaper than that.

I don't know. I'm not the one who posted the picture that implies a transaction that's clearly not viable anymore on the BTC chain.

The average monthly salary in Cuba is about $20. A Bitcoin transaction costs now more than $4. Why would anyone in Cuba want to use Bitcoin over pretty much any other solution?

That's fake news. A segwit transaction is larger than a regular transaction, it just *appears* smaller because the witness data doesn't count into the arbitrary 1 MB limit. Segwit is not going to help you. If that limit is already way too low right now, do you think a 30% bump is going to make a major difference? BTC decided to keep that arbitrary limit, so better get used to $100 to $1000 transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:21:29
Makes sense. The store of value got a too expensive for everyday transactions.
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:19:37
What else should they accept? Right now the next block fee is about $2 - given that the items they're selling cost a few dollars that won't really work.
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:39:42
I just checked the last few BTC blocks. Either your transaction is on a different chain or you're lying. None of the blocks has any transaction with such a low fee.

Just make sure to [bakkt your coins up]( while [hodling](

Does your counterparty keep the channel open for more than 30 days? For example Bitrefill seems to only guarantee 30 days:

I know a few people who regularly trade leveraged Bitcoin shorts/longs. 100% of them are gamblers and have not the slightest idea of risk management. For them trading is just another type of a casino game.

Buy when it goes up. Sell when it goes down. What could possibly go wrong?

Post-fork I sold exactly the same number of coins on all chains so my stake in each of those coins matches their market cap - I hold 20x times more BTC than BCH. But I'm mostly using non-BTC chains for transactions nowadays as I'm not planning to waste huge amounts in fees.
You're obviously someone who never even bothered to learn about Lightning or to use it. Otherwise you would have suggested a non-custodial Lightning wallet such as the "Bitcoin Lightning Wallet" or the Eclair wallet on Android. Instead of just shilling for something that you don't understand I suggest to regularly use BTC for actual transactions so that you see yourself where the pain points are.

I used the fees from  which currently shows a fee of $2 and which in my experience provides the most accurate estimates.
Lightning isn't really an option if you do only very occasional transactions. Channels expire after a while (Bitrefill guarantees 30 days) and there's a fee to open and close the channel. Your $0.000067 fee is very misleading because it doesn't take those fees into account. Using a Lightning channel for just a single transaction (if I have one transaction per month for example) is going to be even more expensive than an on-chain transaction.
Users and merchants are going to use the technology that works best for them. Why would someone consider some complicated experimental technology, when the other option is to use stable battle-tested on-chain transaction on an altcoin with very low fees? Bitcoin won't be able to compete if the community doesn't decide to raise the ridiculously small blocksize.
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:07:32
An example: Your Lightning channel stays open for 30 days. That includes an on-chain transaction fee to open the channel and to close the channel. Let's assume there a no other Lightning related fees (there are). Currently not that many places accept Bitcoin so in the best case I have 2 Lightning transactions per month. That's still an effective $4 fee per Lightning transaction.
Unless your layer two suggestion includes custodial wallets there isn't any layer two solution that currently works well.
@_date: 2019-05-17 08:05:03
With fees at $4 it doesn't look sustainable.
@_date: 2019-05-25 09:23:22
Great! Your solution for high fees is to use a custodial wallet where I don't control the keys. I might as well use Paypal then.
