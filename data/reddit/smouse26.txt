It's people like who stop people from entering bitcoin. Seriously man, saying that John doesn't have the necessary intellect to understand bitcoin? He is a writer for **techcrunch** ffs. He is more technically inclined than most people. If you are implying that someone with John's level of intellect should stay away from bitcoin, then you are saying that majority of the population should stay away, too.

Do they have to register as an MSB?

Although they match buyers with sellers, they receive a commission either in Bitcoin or fiat. Does this change anything?

How does this apply to those selling Bitcoins?

Do businesses selling Bitcoin still have to comply with KYC and AML requirements?

You don't pay the surcharge unless you are late on payments anyways. This doesn't apply to this scenario because you are not borrowing money from them.

Would it theoretically be possible to mine the 20mb coin and not the 1mb coin if there was a hard fork, or does mining give you the same amount of both coins?
If it were possible to mine just one, and miners had to choose which coin to mine, the difficulty for the forked coin would decrease, correct?

The reason MtGox is higher is because it's impossible to withdraw your money out of there. Essentially, you are selling higher on an exchange that you *may or may not* get your money out of **ever.** I believe there is a bounty if you can prove you have successfully withdrew money from there. Sorry, bud.

Is this going to be a Visa or Mastercard?

And hold bitcoin, like online wallets.

Not necessarily, because it's all about the $/Gh. If you are paying the same price per Gh then you are in the same position as everyone else, although potentially higher volume. In the end it won't make a difference on your ROI.
