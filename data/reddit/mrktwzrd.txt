the whole shebang is just ridiculous
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:34:41
nope sorry , iam in for the pot. money to be made.. however i also like the revolutional technology behind it..
but everyone got his price tag... if the price is right i sell, but its def a long term thing.. so not quite there yet..
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:24:20
low risk short setup would look like this..
break of TL .. lower high on a retest.. 
ie sell the break.. RR would be low..
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:21:32
it is possible ..
however .. that call will get burried and forgotten if it dosent happen..
but it will be praised if it happens..
still 50/50...

conservative view.. BTC will hit 20K within the next 3 years..
nevertheless , still stupid if you have a family involved...
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:14:55

@_date: 2017-05-25 18:11:36

ledger+bitpanda+???= profit
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:04:53
sorry i dont know ???
i dont really know whats going on on the BTC tech level..
my guess is dont worry and dont do anything , better be save then sorry.. and a BTC not spent is a BTC saved....

@_date: 2017-07-23 18:26:16
where does the fee go ?
for real how is it split among minérs ? i dont understand that fee thing on Btc 
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:51:09
i own a ledger nano s..
and thats where i keep my coins..
also LTC and Etherum ..
however i also invest into IOTA but for that i only need a seed.. which is offline generated.. so.. iam fine i guess.. ;)
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:57:04
i dont think its one man...
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:55:10
serious question , why and how is that possible ?
how can one miner control BTC ?
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:02:44
me wantz some of theeze...
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:40:44
i guess both are equally fine.. just dont hold your coins on any exchange for longer then u need...
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:27:31
it will drop because there will be no BIP91 ?
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:59:21
yea? ... i can hookup on ANY computer with a chrome extension 
plug in my ledger and boom.. my wallet shows up... so basically
my ledger is the storage and key ...
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:38:04
is  hype is a necessity for BTC to gain widespread adoption ?
what are your thoughts ?
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:30:30
leaving coins/tokens  on what eva exchange is always a bad idea..
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:12:30
want to buy some coin ?
i sell you 1 BTC for 3000
deal ?
want to sell some coin ?
i will buy 1 BTC for 1500
deal ?
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:04:06

@_date: 2017-07-23 17:24:00
could you may eloborate why you think that way? ..
@_date: 2019-05-20 18:19:16
sure , but the ETF market seems to bigger then the crypto market as a whole ?
wouldnt that be a sort of concerne..
ie  . dont bite more of then you could chew...
@_date: 2019-05-20 17:33:04
Vaneck ETF decision .. denial , approval or delayed ?
your  thoughts ?
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:57:28
keep em there and wait till the dust settles.. u wont lose anything...
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:49:27
thank you for your input...
hmm.. i dont think that BTC is seasonal... i know u may mean that it takes such and such weeks/months for the next build up to the next hypephase...  but still ..
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:53:06
il make that £50... no joke btw..
@_date: 2019-05-20 17:35:31
