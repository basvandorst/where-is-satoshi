Japanese bank. They can legally accept USD.

I had to check the URL to see if this was an onion article...

You know what's better? Living breathing human beings JUST LIKE YOU now have more choices for themselves about how they want to live their lives.
I guarantee that if we were arguing that YOU should drop everything and stay home to take care of your family, you'd be singing a different tune. And for this reason, your opinion is wrong (and stupid).

Because a few years down the road, this ends up being a retarded solution. Try thinking ahead a bit.

Every single person who's bet against BTC has gotten completely FUCKED over the years. I HODL because I don't want to get fucked by bitcoin. 
In a couple of weeks, send me a message and I'll have some soothing lotion sent to you, because you bet against bitcoin and are about to get fucked.

This is the kind of quality shitpost that keeps me coming back here!
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:40:47
The shittiest part to me is that there's good evidence that the BTC miners are submitting spam transactions (seriously, look up some of the previous reddit posts about this subject) to make you have to pay $68 in transfer fees. I honestly don't know who's doing it, but they obviously want BTC to be hard/expensive to use. I wonder who would benefit from that...
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:03:25
I had to scrape the salt off of my monitor first before I could even read this article. It's getting a bit pathetic...

The market cap is meaningless. There's lots of bcash around, so high market cap. No one uses it though, except when Roger does one of his pump/dump days so he can leave gullible posters holding the bag.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:28:28
You're right, but that's what makes me sooooo bullish on BTC. It's really rare. Only 21 mil will be available EVER. Once wealthy people realize that, and that crypto is the way finance will be done in the future, well, see you on the MOON!
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:10:46
I really believe you made a great choice! If you just hold on, even for 6 months, I promise it will change your life!
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:54:27
It's Apple Cash not iCash ok?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:15:55
That's true, but I get comfort by thinking about all the stuff that has to happen before BTC crashes to 0. I've been holding on to this shit for YEARS, through plenty of crazy ups and downs that were way worse than before, and every time it's gone back up. I don't know for sure that it will again, but nothing has changed so much that I think it won't.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:00:29
You too! And thanks for being so sweet in an environment that's usually sooooo terrible!
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:02:59
I could be wrong, but I believe very strongly that I'm not. There's enough other people who believe in BTC as much as I do for it to be worth 10000+ USD right now. That's a life-changing amount of money for the MAJORITY of people on this planet right now, and only a tiny tiny fraction of the earth's population are using it. There are news articles every day about it now, and the amount of daily trades in USD being made is increasing exponentially. 
So, you seem quite confident that I'm wrong, and that's cool. I admit I very well might be, but given my argument, isn't at least a possiblity that I'm not wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:55:54
I may be wrong, but it sounds like you are trying to say HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:33:27
Well, coinbase also charges you a premium since it's not an exchange either. But doing it that way should at least allow you to cash out in Canada.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:05:42
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:07:24
This is the kind of thing that makes me so hopeful about Bitcoin. We're all part of rewarding someone REALLY great at what they do. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:40:26
They are basically the Canadian version of coinbase. They support interac money transfers which is basically an instant way to buy. 
They aren't a real exchange though, so you'll pay a premium for your first purchase. However, you can buy something like LTC and send it to a real exchange to trade. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:19:01
Jesus. I snorted and thought "ya right" when I read your prediction earlier today, but I'm willing to admit when I'm wrong. 
I bow down to your predictive power Bitcoin Nostradamus!
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:21:31
Yeah, look at Binance too. Price is trending downwards, but some folks are still buying at the current price... WHY? I mean, look at that fucking sell wall...
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:17:39
I think I watched a documentary about this!
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:34:22
Speak for yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:55:23
That's fair. It's a problem, and I can't even claim that I'm sure BTC will survive it. Getting out now is likely the best move.
I'm only arguing from the position of someone who's tried to time the BTC market before (sell high buy low), and I've gotten burned every time. I'd literally be twice as wealthy if I had just HODL! So, considering seeing that again and again from one crisis to the next over the years, I'm somewhat bullish on the platform despite those that would try to do it harm. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:10:33
I think we're discussing the bcash pump in a different thread. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:32:57
It means that anyone who has BCH on other exchanges should get to selling it in a hurry before it's worthless...
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:41:44
Y tho...?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:28:02
Sure, 10K isn't a life changing amount for most middle class people (though I really had most of the rest of the world's population in mind with my statement). However, say every middle class household with a mortgage got 10K applied on the principle. For some folks with 25+ year amortization, that could mean 3-5+ years of no mortgage payments depending on the property value. So, ask yourself, what is 4 extra years of retirement worth to the average person?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:28:20
You haven't gotten fucked yet for sure, and it's always a good idea to take some profits. However, cashing out completely is betting against bitcoin, and I've never seen that go well in the last 8ish years. 
With all that said man, you do what you need to.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:43:35
You're absolutely right, and I really would feel terrible if I mislead anyone vulnerable in to making a mistake. I just really feel confidently about the technology and how it's going to change our society (for the better, like the internet did!).
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:26:28
Yep, I really believe that THIS is what's happening with the price more than anything else. Crossing 10K per coin was a huge psychological barrier for early whales, and now those with huge stockpiles of coin are taking some profits. 
This is actually REALLY GOOD for BTC in the long run. Huge sums of bitcoin in the hands of a single person are hard to hold as the value of them grows. However when a whale takes profits, they are distributing the coins among the masses. Not everyone who buys will be a long term holder, but it's always likely that a certain percentage will be. 
Each time we go through one of these price cycles, we come through the other side with just a few more *true believers* who will hold on to their coins. Thus BTC becomes more scarce and the price rises.
