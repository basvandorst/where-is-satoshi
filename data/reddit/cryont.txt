" And I'll also point out explicitly that it is \*not a goal\* of the system to handle transactions that are underpaying fees. " 
Well that censors poor people of the world out of the system if they are able to transfer couple hundred satoshis at max.

Did you transact BTC during Dec 2017 or Jan 2018? I did and I didn't like over 16 hours tx times and huge fees in satoshis (who the fuck cares about fees in dollars). We have experienced full blocks and it is a real problem that will come again quite soon if it's not dealt with. The flood network attack hasn't happened. 
I like to use BTC on-chain.

There would be no incentive to do so economically and this kind of scenario has never happened and never will. Nobody would waste so much money for fun.

Well when the bull market begins and blocks get full quite rapidly because there will be a lot more people and so also tx traffic on-chain you will understand what I try to point out here.

But until it has actually happened it is not relevant. You fix the problems that actually exist not the imaginary ones.

Time will tell how it goes.

Yeah but if the BTC network becomes unusable there's no point for cencorship-resistance anymore if there'll be no users left. If you concentrate too much on c-r you'll push the users away. I think there have to be a balance with these things.
