Sorry!  I thought I may have found somebody who could help.  But look at the bright side—if you start getting paid in BTC you could then buy and sell and have a monopoly on the entire country!

Looks like there's [one buyer]( on the ground, at the very bottom, could it be that he also sells but is out of stock at the moment?  I think there's definitely market opportunity if fees are so high as it is.

Maybe show them [BitPremier]( just to warm them up to the idea and show them that there are plenty of bitcoin millionaires and big spenders out there.  They even have a [real estate section](

Obviously, but when you buy one share of KO you don't pay the [$45 that Wall St. pays]( you pay roughly $55 (say you're using TD Ameritrade) which is over 20% more.  Same deal when you sell that share.  What price do you think you can get euros for at your local bank, compared to the price Goldman gets when they want to buy or sell?  Much of our economy still benefits on these differences and arbitrage opportunities, and we'd be kidding ourselves if we pretended that a lot of the activity and interest in bitcoin didn't stem from the money making opportunities, I mean there's still an &gt;$18/BTC arbitrage opportunity [buying Coinbase]( and [selling p2p]( in almost every market out there.

I imagine something on [LBC India]( should fit for you.

Any high-rep. [trader in Nippon]( will be able to get you BTC, likely anonymously and almost certainly instantly.  It's gotten really popular since the Japanese Central Banks took interest rates below zero.

Wirex still hasn't solved the time delay issue however, and the only instant way of [getting BTC through PayPal is LocalBitcoins]( although it comes with a fee

Have you tried [Mycelium's app](  It's anonymous and instant.    
And they won't do much better for you on price but [247exchange]( and [Purse]( take prepaid debit.

Maybe talk to him about [Bitwage]( since they integrated with [Uphold]( you can get paid in bitcoin, €, gold, silver, USD . . .
