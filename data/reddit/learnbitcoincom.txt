This question needs an answer badly...

The fee market problems will not be resolved by SegWit (or SegWit+LN with no on chain capacity increase. But it is true that by constraining the available block size to 1MB Bitcoin and even off-chain solutions like LN or RSK (both require 2 transactions to open and close channels/pegs) will not be enough to relieve the pressure of full blocks.
The block size needs to increase now, AND in the future. 
2MB hard fork is a band aid to end the huge tx backlog and reduce fees to a sane level. Then we can work on a solution like adaptive block size with safety limits to ensure future growth is not stalled. Do that and we have plenty or room for real economic activity, LN, RSK, and whatever else some kid in a garage is imagining building right now.
The current situation is untenable. It's pretty clear that SegWit, in its current implementation is not going to activate. UASF is a joke. 
2MB is a real short term solution.

I never promoted the agreement. 
I also don't agree it was a disaster. Over 80% of the hashing power and a large portion of the economic community are screaming from the hilltops for a solution.
Discounting them because you do not completely agree seems like a brazen and hasty thing to do.

PoW change to what?
Measuring anything by UASF nodes is a giant Sybil attack.

Your a very active voice suddenly, whats your motivation?

While I cant speak for the articles author, I can say that I am neither a "big blocker" or a "small blocker", in fact I try not to be a blocker at all.
I'm a bitcoin enthusiast who is strongly for increasing Bitcoin's transaction capacity in a way that is trustless and decentralized for as many users as possible. 


Again with the "big blockers", whats with the divisive labeling?
As for "fake" agreements, while it may or may not come to be, I think the most important thing to take away from that letter was the wide support it received from both it's signers, and other members of the community. 


Agreed, 2MB does not change this today, and it will change it even less in the future, see [Moore's Law](
As for your final comment, where you state you read things more carefully only when "Core" cant be blamed, well, I guess it speaks for itself.
