when crypto becomes universal, vendors will go with cheaper transaction costs and faster transfers. If Bitcoin was the only crypto, then yes.

then what is it? an artificial value of "universal connection?" ? Most of the miners are centralized so not even that is truly decentralized.

Why do people think BTC is an actual decent product? It's slower and more expensive than other coins out there right now. 
Lot of dumb and new money flooding the market right now with FOMO

This is what gets lost in the ocean of memes. You are correct, the HODL mentality is what has caused it for it get to where we are. Those that bought bitcoin after thanksgiving are gone now. They will learn and soon HODL when they comeback.

Agreed. These normies gives us a bad name.
Regulation is =! to Crypto. Even if people say "regulatory adoption" will bring more credibility. 
Crypto doesn't need centralized organizations to deem it ok for it to coexist. It is already here and its here to stay whether a regulatory body agrees with it or not.
