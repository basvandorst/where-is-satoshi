You have to buy a $100 receptor / transmitter. Yea I see your point. Still a big leap forward in terms of self sufficiency though. A world that "goes to shit" is more likely to have internet anyways...probably just not safety

$338,095. That's the current market value of gold ($7.1 trillion / 21MM). You were close.

Good thing there's BitStream so we don't need the internet anymore...

I am bullish if this is really true. That just makes the limited supply all the more valuable. More people are entering crypto now, not leaving it. This will make supply even smaller and each coin all the more valuable.

You're a moron if you can't see the forest through the trees. I know that Bobby Lee of BTCChina is his brother but dude this isn't some conspiracy theory. Please be smart with your money. Just because you HOPE really badly it's a conspiracy theory does not help your case. Chuck Lee is a good man with millions in the bank. He doesn't need to defraud people on a massive scale just to collect a few more of if his own coins.

Great article. This is exactly what I was looking for. A very rational analysis. There is so much positive BS on this sub sometimes and this was a real, actual analysis with risks and mitigants. Keep on writing articles and I will keep reading them. Nice job.

I agree with you here but he is getting better at PR. It's a learning curve.

Good point. Not having local exchanges for fiat conversion does suck. Still think this can be useful tech somehow given the current situation.

401k is for safety. Digital money is for the Wild West.

This is correct. People only trust bitcoin because they know they can cash out of exchanges to banks for real spendable currency. Not that bitcoin isn't a currency. But it would make everything much harder.
