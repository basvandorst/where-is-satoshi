Feel free to ignore downvotes. Some are machine generated via the local anti-vote-rigging system, others are just resident trolls.

I fear that you have misread the context. This is simply 101. Building a bot or automating trading systems of some sort (as Alpha492 has done successfully) without understanding these basics first is unlikely. In my experience, these indicators do help make money on cryptocurrency markets.

re: If short position is not on margin, I don't see a reason for closing your position without your consent.
I agree and was extremely surprised, hence my post.

It's being handled internally to Coinbase, then, as a database entry, and won't show on the blockchain directly until they reconcile many client withdrawals in a larger transaction later.
The music industry does love their tech and makes sense as another early adopter for Bitcoin payments.

I was not on margin.

I lost beer money, I'm sure someone lost mortgage money.
I exited a short at 555, my last action was to enter another short at 542 and this is the trade log. No, I did not have any other USD in here to enter a long position.

BTC-e has never closed a short position before in my use of the exchange, nor have I heard of this happening. But then, we've never had a bearish 10/21 EMA crossover in 1d Bitcoin before last Friday.

Post author here. I'm flattered to see this submission. I wish I had more examples for you in the article. But this is a relatively new area and we seem to be seeing geographic expressions of the phenomenon where expertise in technology and cannabis coincides, e.g. in Northern California.

I agree with your analysis in large part, but BTC-e needs to be up front about their policy, and stop pretending that we can enter and exit any trade we like (as was the case until recently).

No, just selling BTCUSD on the web interface. That's why this is an issue.

Web interface. This is a complaint about not being able to sell the instrument at any rate below 542 during that time, essentially.

While it is certainly brazen and courageous to operate a clearweb pot store in the post-Silk Road era, it is important to note that medicinemansdispensary is not operating in a legal fashion as was the South Bay Apothecary Collective.

BTC-e normally lets you sell bitcoins for dollars while the price is dropping, then buy back a greater number of bitcoins at a lower dollar price.
As of writing, they were not honoring such trades, instead refunding initial purchase minus fees.
This may be related to the breaching of the 12 hour timeframe low low price at 550 today, as well as the recent first ever bearish 10/21 EMA crossover in 1 day timeframe.

Wasn't on margin. This was just a "Sell BTCUSD" action. The problem is BTC-e followed it with a "Buy BTCUSD" action without my consent.
