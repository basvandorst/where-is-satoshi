Lmao, you clearly have no idea what Korea is trying to do.
1 in 4 people own crypto and the 6 major banks are starting to facilitate kyc accounts for crypto in a week.
Next time please get your information from somewhere other than Telegram or lazy western journalists that can't source information.
If they wanted to ban it it would already be banned. So stop talking nonsense.

Perfectly reasonable questions that will give most crypto 'investors' anxiety.


You pretty much got it there.
Due to the volatility of bitcoin, it's historically been a matter of just waiting long enough for it to go back up. Of course, there will be a day that that stops being true and everyone averaging down will be left holding a much bigger bag than they hoped.
It's hard to properly and objectively give bitcoin a valuation and most people in it are not experienced traders. They don't set targets or stops. It's really more blind speculation that it will bounce.

No dude don't you know Asians are all programmed to cash out 3 weeks before lunar new year?
It would have been a better explanation to say it's normal for January, in combination with overinflated FUD. Instead OP went the vaguely offensive route of insinuating that people will sell on a low because they have to buy a present...
Wonder if he knows that people have jobs and savings? Or that, at least in Korea, it's usually only parents or elders shelling out the most money?
But nah, let's just go with an unnecessary appeal to oriental mysticism that's completely out of my circle of competence...

Classic signs of problem gambling. Playing for a win, not for a profit. Chasing the loss. Not the slightest clue what 'sunk cost fallacy' means. Superstitious beliefs.
OP, if you actually want help, I think you need some counselling. I work at a gambling addictions lab and I can forward you some resources if you message me your city. If you're too proud for that, please just stick to index funds and stop trying to pick individual securities. You are not as good at it as you think you are, unfortunately.

1. So you're saying you should buy high and sell low instead? 
2. Selling is temporary, not permanent. Also whoever predicted that is unreasonably optimistic. 
3. Past performance is not an indicator of future returns.

Already tested highs of ₩5M today. I usually track both KRW and USD though.

And that we correct this week. Anyone else got some feelings?

Could just be Koreans getting on the train. Most citizens here in SK don't look at the North as anything more than attention whores. If they wanted to avoid volatility BTC is a dumb place to go.

You're also in your late thirties. I'm in my twenties. If I lose a couple grand I have time to make it back. But if I get a big payout, it can compound for 10 more years compared to you. No home to repo, no kids to feed, no one cares if I eat ramen for a few weeks. Younger people have less to lose and more to gain. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:03:34
Eh, it seems obvious to you, but you're not hard pressed to find people here who really think like that.

The only good advice in this thread
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:26:15
Seems like this depends on your bias in who you take notice of. For example just in this thread you can see both calls for 10k and calls for mass shorts. Not that I disagree with the concept, I try to do that myself.

You don't know Charlie very well do you?
Always rattling on about something he's tangentially connected to.
