The negative opinion of BTC in this article stems from the idea that creating a new gold standard is not a good idea:


Do I really want to use BTC to buy a meal when I know I might be able to pay rent with that same amount at a later time? I'm not sure whether I feel the same as Krugman or not.

I suppose I'll have to quote then. Claim  highlighted in bold:






You've claimed that 1% of $1 trillion (=$10billion) is currently trading, and divided by the total number of bitcoins in existence to arrive at the $917 figure.

Twice now you've dismissed the basis from which your $917/bitcoin figure was drawn (transaction volume divided by number of existing bitcoins). 
Considering adoption rates and making comparisons to Paypal is a whole other can of worms with too many hidden variables and speculations that I'd rather not debate about. That's something that I think would prefer somebody put a computer model through various situations before publicly making claims about.

I want to analyze your argument a bit, to make it explicitly clear to anyone who can read. Help me out if you like.
Claim  we currently trade $10 billion in bitcoin
Claim  10,900,000 bitcoins exist
Therefore the value per bitcoin is ($10 billion)/(10,900,000 bitcoins) = $917/bitcoin
The missing logical element here is an understanding of what you mean by claiming that we currently trade $1 billion in bitcoin. Could you clarify what you mean when you say we are trading $1 billion in bitcoin?
