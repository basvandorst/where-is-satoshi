So just because I cashed out to secure all my profits I suddenly don't believe in crypto?

interesting question, I have been wondering the same... Just because that current BTC marketcap is 240bUSD it does not mean that 240 billion dollars has been invested in Bitcoin. It simply means that some of the 5% "active" bitcoins has been bought/sold to an increasingly higher price. 
95% of BTC is owned by people who invested to HODL and to create profit over time. These people are simply not going to be using their BTC for everyday purchases similar to how they spent FIAT. 
Once the large holders of BTC decides to convert a large chunk of their BTC to FIAT, we will see a big drop in prices, especially once fear and panic sets in. 
Fear and panic is not as common in the stock market since the majority is "experts". In the world of crypto, not so much.
Fear and panic in the stock market is not as common, since a large part of the stockbrokers have a lot of experience in the field. In the world of crypto, not so much. 
*edit. Yes - people will eventually start using their cryptos for everyday purchases just like with fiat currencies - it's just not going to happen any time soon (1-3 years).

I want to be clear that this is the "effective reward per day". Not the actual reward per block. The effective increase happens because by driving down hashpower until the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment kicks in, you can get more than 144 blocks per day ... on average.
Bitcoin Cash yearly inflation rate and mining rewards are effectively increased until/unless EDA is removed from the code.
Block times must remain erratic as long as miners continue to behave rationally and increase their profits by using this exploit.
A miner does not have to be specially configured. All he has to do is mine the most profitable chain and this will occur.

No I have absolutely no empirical evidence, but you also saw a surge in BTC price right before the BCH hardfork. Who doesnt want free coins whenever it hardforks? Everyone who had BTC when BCH split will make money if either BCH/BTC "wins". The same can be said about the segwit2x - however this fork didnt happen, so now there's no reason for big investors to hold BTC since they did not solve the scaling issue.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:41:26
Maybe if you hold it for a couple of years you'll be fine. However, the recent surge from 3k-7k was mostly bc of the free segwitx2 coins people thought they were getting. It was also a possible solution for the increasing fees and scaling issues. However, now that sw2 has been cancelled, we're back to where we started, and so far there has been no other possible solutions for the scaling issues. That's why you're currently seeing a lot of BTC market cap transferring to BCH since BCH does not have any scaling issues at the moment
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:53:56
There's no need to. BCH was created because core group supporters could not agree. Some wanted to keep Satoshis whitepaper intact, while others wanted to revamp it. Currently it seem like the ladder was the best option. But still it's incredible hard to tell what will happen in the next couple of days/months/years. The market is like a complex organism that is almost impossible to predict. Crypto is still in its infancy, similar to what MSDOS was before Windows 10.

If you think that Roger Ver is the one influencing 2bUSD worth of transactions, you haven't done your homework properly.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:50:01
and what smart solutions is that? And what exactly do you mean by parroting FUD? I am telling you why I believe the market is behaving like it is. If you cannot allow critique regarding BTC, you should not be investing in the first place. Investing is about questioning and doubting everything so that you can make the best decision. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:27:18
Of course it isn't. No one use crypto to buy anything physical, yet.
But with what you just said it seem like you're not quite familiar to the world of investing. Investing is the process of laying out money now to receive more money in the future.” The goal of investing is to put your money to work in one or more types of investment vehicles in the hopes of growing your money over time. 
Investors invest in crypto because they believe that one day it will become similar to digital money, meaning that people all over the world will use it to buy bagels and coffee.
If you have any other questions/remarks, feel free to shoot. It seem like you still have a lot to learn.

what do you gain from a comment like that? I'm simply presenting what I think. If you dont agree, tell me why and we can have a discussion.

This comment will get deleted within a couple of hours, if not minutes, since the administrators of the /bitcoin subreddit usually will delete every comment from people that are bullish of BCH. Head over to /btc if you want to read posts that has not been filtered by admins in order to propagate BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:41:20
Even if you want to, you cant pull out of BTC for the next 4-8+ hours unless you're willing to pay a larger tx fee than the avg 18USD. Mempool is completely clogged with more than 120.000 transactions and counting
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:32:14
This is not true. I have been posting lots of comments and posts on both and Granted, you get downvoted on if you post any criticism without any reasoning behind it, but on your post will be removed if you post anything positive about bitcoin cash. It's not by chance that 8bUSD has been added to the BCH marketcap within the last 24 hours. 
The recent surge from 3k-7k was (MOST LIKELY - nobody knows) due to the free segwitx2 coins people would be  getting. It was also a possible solution for the increasing fees and scaling issues. However, now that sw2 has been cancelled, we're back to where we started, and so far there has been no other possible solutions for the scaling issues. That's why you're currently seeing a lot of BTC market cap transferring to BCH since BCH does not have any scaling issues at the moment. Unfortunately, this comment will likely get deleted within a couple of hours, if not minutes, since the administrators of the /bitcoin subreddit usually will delete every comment from people that are bullish of BCH. If I had posted the same comment being bullish of BTC on it would probably get downvoted, but NOT removed. For anyone with any comments/remarks, feel free to let me know, but please provide reasoning to whatever argument you may have so we can have a discussion.

Probably true. But big bankers will invest in whatever investment vehicle that can grow their initial investment. The huge potential for most cryptos including BTC is that one day it can be used as digital currency so users can purchase bagels, cigarettes and coffee etc. Currently BTC tx fees are too expensive for transferring small amounts of BTC, which was supposedly one of Bitcoin's biggest advantages. Currently it is not, and Segwit2x was a possible solution for this problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:26:21
Do your own research like everyone else. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:45:05
As I said before, BTC has not been able to solve the scaling issues for 38 months. Segwit2x was a possible solution to this problem - and since it has now been cancelled we're back to where we started. Don't expect to see a massive surge in BTC price for the next couple of months
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:39:36
Exactly. But those 5USD tx fees is what currently makes investors nervous, as it seem there is still no real way to solve the scaling issues without splitting the core support group. BCH still follows the original vision of Satoshi, which does not have any scaling issues or high fees. Currently, BCH can process 5 times more transactions 
 per second than Visa, so scaling wont be an issue for the next 5-6 years at least.

I am sorry to hear that you sold your BCH for btc linkamus, so far that has been an extremely dumb decision. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:17:50
I'm sure you do. Our fundamental understanding to why the market is behaving as it is is very different, and we can probably argue till we die of old age - but if you think that big money is what gives any particular crypto its value, I don't think you understand the basics of digital assets.
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:09:11
Reddit is the exact opposite - they’re bullish because they want to profit as quickly as possible. simple as that
@_date: 2018-12-08 12:12:55
I honestly dont think we will see a bull market for the next 3-5 years, or at least I dont hope so..  if we go back to pre-november 17 prices, I will be slowly accumulating cryptos until the adoption, convenience of use and the tech is all aligned - which will take at least a couple more years
@_date: 2019-05-09 12:49:07
What if I told you that 2019 was just a bull trap?
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:41:45


It actually was a 20% flash crash, but it stabilised at -9,39% - so indeed a 10% drop
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:17:35
It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that we're about to see another "red wedding" in the crypto space. A couple of days ago, when 0.017% of the BTC supply was sold, it caused a 10% drop. That's how illiquid the market is right now.
