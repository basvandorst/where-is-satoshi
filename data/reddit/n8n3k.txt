I don't think the problem with public schools is lack of funding. Rather they were invented to create obedient people.


If you're concerned about that, wouldn't it be better to support projects like One Laptop Per Child?


It is, by leading me to invest in Bitcoin to defund the government and thus end compulsory schooling.

What a horrible idea. If you really want to improve education, donate to khanacademy or betterexplained or something. Public schools are nothing but indocrination and humilation.

Bitcoin is controlled by the investors, only a majority of investors could change things (
I don't see a problem with this (not that there is anything I could do if I did) because all investors have generally the same interest: To raise bitcoins price.
Investors also have the same interest as other investors because other investors help raise the bitcoin price too.

+ It would probably be impossible for any one person to buy the majority of all bitcoins since he couldn't buy them all at present exchange rates, he would raise the price massively.
+ Even if someone did it he would still have the same interests as all other investors: Raising the bitcoin price

It's important to point out here, that ASICs are a huge win for bitcoin, because people who own them have an incentive to secure bitcoin - their ASICs aren't worth anything if bitcoin isn't. Without ASICs anything from a botnet to a server farm could take over bitcoin.
Also Bitcoin becomes decentralized because lots of people have an incentive to start mining, to buy and produce ASICs.
And we should destroy this to protect the market share of Slush's pool?

This will be possible when everyone recognizes that bitcoin is a better store of value then fiat money - and thus fiat money will become worthless. Then stores will accept bitcoin - and only bitcoin - not because it's more practical for them but because that will be the only currency of any value.

Well fiat is a reasonable store of value too (compared to everything but bitcoin), and of course it has a large market cap.
But it is true that a currencies qualities as medium of exchange also matter, just that they're not as important as store of value (otherwise wow gold would be the world's currency)

Since apparently people don't read the article before commenting, here is the full text:
*It makes no sense to account in or exchange something that one doesn’t want*
# World of Warcraft Gold as Medium of Exchange
Transactions in World of Warcraft gold are cheaper and faster than transactions in bitcoin, gold or fiat money, so it should be a better medium of exchange. Yet is has a far smaller market cap then all these alternatives. Why?
It’s because the market cap of a currency is primarily determined by its usefulness as a store of value, not as a medium of exchange. Why?
When you decide whether to sell one currency for another, what’s more important: Which currency you can buy coffee with (or world of warcraft weapons), and which currency will still be worth something in ten years? Most people’s savings are greater than the money they have to carry around with them to buy to a cup coffee, whenever they want one. (And some people have very large savings.)
# Stocks as Unit of Account
A stocktrader doesn’t account in how many stocks of particular companies he’ll end up with. Why? Owning as many stocks as possible is not his goal. He can’t be sure that he can still sell them when he retires and he can’t buy coke with them now.
# Bitcoin as a store of value
Even though you can’t buy a coffee with bitcoins in most places, and even though accounting with it isn’t particularly simple, many people own bitcoins. Why?
Bitcoin is a better store of value than fiat money (no inflation) and gold (less risk of theft and confiscation).

bitcoin will be stable when it replaced fiat money and gold. before it can't be. it's better then fiat money and gold. it could only be stable when everyone decided to sell when it's over a certain price and to buy when it's below that. why would that happen?
calling bitcoin unstable, when measured dollar, makes as much sense as calling the dollar unstable, measured in bitcoin:
