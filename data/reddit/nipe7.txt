I find it interesting that people keep saying "Never buy at an ATH, always wait for a dip" but if you waited for the dip this week, you would have bought at $9,800 and been stressed out watching it go up for two weeks straight.

I bought in a month ago, and I'm glad I did. That dip hasn't happened yet ;)

That's why I just bought some Raiblocks yesterday while I was browsing an IOTA thread. I'm glad for my decision.

I'm glad you have some!

So... Did you buy any yet?

In my opinion you should definitely maintain possession of your own crypto. One of the huge benefits of crypto over something like gold is that it's not owned by a centralised organisation. When you hold your own bitcoin, no organisation or government can say "No, that's actually our bitcoin now". On the other hand, you have to be responsible and make sure that you keep your crypto safe and secure. Also make sure that you are 100% sure that your sending/receiving transactions are correct. Cause if you send something to the wrong place, there's no big organisation there to save your ass.

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. But doesn't this mean that the distribution of bitcoin wealth is WAY WORSE than the distribution of FIAT wealth? Won't this make it pretty much impossible for the general public to get involved and use it as a currency, when less that 1% of the population holds the vast majority of the currency? When that 1% can just decide on a dime to sell it all, and buy into something else that they feel like should be the new standard?
I absolutely love bitcoin, blockchain and crypto. But I am very concerned about this distribution issue.

Raiblocks on the move! Instant transactions, zero fees, highly scalable network, and not on any major exchanges yet.

I found out where I'm moving when I retire

You should already be able to play for hours...
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:45:06
Right... but will it drop?

@_date: 2017-11-28 18:52:17

Since you can only buy ANT miners with BCH, it's likely that a large player in Korea is buying BCH in order to buy ANT miners, to start a new mining pool.

TIL there's 6 million BTC
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:42:00
I think it's probably still at least a couple bucks.

He finally made the divine move.

Hahaha, you're good. We're still in the high 8000's. $8,741 USD on coinmarketcap.
