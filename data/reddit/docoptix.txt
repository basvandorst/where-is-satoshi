Last time I checked, purse.io wasn't available in Germany

well intra-EU it is free and takes like a day

You seem to be kinda new around here. BCH people were fighting for block size increases for years. All they got was "we wont hard fork and block size increases are bad. So go away and fork your own version of Bitcoin". And thus BCH was born.

You cannot fund a LN channel with 10usd either...

We are talking about the closing TX
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:35:12
What mechanism enforces the miner to validate that?
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:52:15
Also, they do not pay 18bn, most will be unsellable stocks, etc

Max 1hr, sry don't mention it anywhere I think.

No, I don't Apple.

Dev here.
I had some free time and wanted this primarily for myself - but in case anyone wants to collaborate you are happily invited to do so.
Questions &amp; feedback welcome.

Regarding the 'scaling solution' part on both options: I think neither can be called a 'long term solution' - we just don't know how a long-term solution will look like, maybe there even isn't one (Bitcoin failed then).
All BU wants to achieve here is to offer the additional option of scaling on-chain (as it has been the original idea of Bitcoin).
@_date: 2017-02-09 09:51:19
As I see it, there are multiple ways of scaling without recording every penny:
1. Trusted sidechains, like Coinbase (just banks, basically)
2. Other methods of payment
3. Lightning or other smart, trustless Bitcoin extensions
For option 3, you need to increase the block size. So why don't we start doing that right now?
@_date: 2017-02-23 08:05:11
use the TRON button ��
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:09:04
That is not what I meant. We were talking about double spends. Is the following possible?:
1. User opens channel via funding TX_in (onchain)
2. User can build a TX1_out which would close the channel and refund him 
3. User buys coffee from Merchant. Now both the User and the Merchant can build a TX2_out which they could use to settle on the chain.
3. User now settles TX1_out, which is still a valid TX onchain. TX2_out is now not valid anymore
4. User enjoys free coffee paid by double-spend.

Screenshot is just a screenshot. AFAIK my server calculates correctly.

Anyone who had a glance at the IT infrastructure of the current financial system knows that Bitcoin's electricity needs are not even comparable (yet)
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:24:55
So you'd like to go back to GPRS? Also, what would be bad about more people using Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:21:13
I don't know about other Big Blockers, but this is exactly my reasoning.
@_date: 2016-03-01 09:26:20
Sorry for pluggin in here, but can you point me to documentation for transaction autocancel/timeout? I was trying to find out about that earlier and basically ended up with contradicting/outdated info.
@_date: 2016-06-22 11:10:35
I've worked in a project related to (German) bank IT. The datasets involved were about internal IT maintentance cost/budget positions. Since I saw these, I am 100% sure that the Bitcoin mining/infrastructure will never even come close to the scale of traditional bank IT...
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:50:25
I am talking about waste of electricity
@_date: 2016-06-08 08:38:03
Why would a double-spending (whichever way) not be handled like a credit card chargeback (or something similar)?
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:07:54
TXs are instant (0-conf), but I guess you were not here yet when this was how we used Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:26:07
Did the mentioned block size study include that 4MB blocks might have 4x as many users (-&gt; businesses -&gt;nodes)? It just seems odd to predict a 5% node loss taking the growth into account. You did not link to the study, do you have it?
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:42:34
I am sorry to mention it, but "Satoshi's Vision" usually references the Bitcoin Whitepaper you linked. So what is wrong about mentioning it?
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:26:20
Even if one beer is $100,000 then?
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:10:54
isn't your premise somewhat contradictory?
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:31:00
AFAIK yours.org is just one of many bitcoin projects which see no future with a settlement coin. lots of companies need the original bitcoin vision of p2p cash...
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:52:01
I thought SegWit TXs need more space than normal TXs.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:55:15
The clashic blocks are not valid on the Cash chain. What exactly do you mean with "wipeout"?
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:35:18
Well Satoshi assumed that nomrla user will use SPV wallets IIRC. In that case the resources needed to run a full node don't matter anymore. Lots of people in did not dismiss the original idea.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:48:39
That is pretty much the update Cash is rolling out tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-07-24 06:56:17
A Humble Bundle
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:51:12
Smartphones will not be able to run full nodes in thr near future. But they are already the main type of computer people use.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:17:11
@_date: 2018-11-17 08:57:24
FYI BCH wallets had the same problems with Bitpay.
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:20:05
at 10kUSD/BTC that will be the case, so we are already halfway there:
'if' 10k USD = 1 BTC
-&gt; 10 USD = 1 mBTC
-&gt; 0.01 USD = 1 µBTC = 1 'bit'
I know that 'bits' technically make no sense, but I think it would be a great, catchy name.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:42:05
But then you were here when the  troll horde was rolling. I was actually pretty surprised they weren't censored away.
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:45:23
I always hear that bigger blocks lead to fewer nodes. Are there numbers supporting this? What was the node count when we had avg 0.5MB block vs now? Shouldn't increased adoption as a currency mean more users - more nodes?
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:31:07
I am pretty certain the root of this has been caused by the block size debate. Satoshi might not have put in the limit if he'd known that it would split the community a couple of years down the road.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:26:05
Just imagine the core dev team was in some (bad) way compromised - not saying it is right now (so don't ban pls ;-).
How would the community get the power "back"?
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:57:45
I thought we had that done already...
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:43:34
If the core team would schedule a hard fork where most others agree with it would also just happen without much trouble.
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:28:24
What is happening now is the result of the core devs refusing to hardfork to a higher block size. Under the assumption that some of these would accept a successful B2X fork and integrate it in core, what would you say?

You can use Coinbase, though.
@_date: 2016-05-01 09:23:25
You can just use SEPA transfers. I did this multiple times and never took longer than a day.
EDIT: Coinbase

Isn't BCH much closer to the Bitcoin Satoshi envisioned than BTC?
@_date: 2016-05-06 22:59:48
The article quotes some "Bitcoin-Expert" with "you would need to wait 10mins while paying at the bakery" ...
@_date: 2015-02-03 08:15:35
Any sources on that?
