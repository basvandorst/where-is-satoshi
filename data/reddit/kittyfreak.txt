Question...what if I open a channel, make some purchases and get the goods/services that I want. Then I try to game the (linked) channels for a tiny amount (smaller than the Bitcoin transaction fee). Is it worth it to enforce the penalty? ...not sure if that is a plausible scenario with LN, but curious if possible.

Does this require identify to create a channel? That doesn't necessarily exist in Bitcoin...nor should it.

If you have USD on one exchange and you want to buy an altcoin on an exchange and they only accept deposits in bitcoin, when you convert USD to BTC to Altcoin, can you consolidate the trade and use the original USD as the basis for the ALT?

I often use "specific share identification" identified by the size of the trade. Is that legit?

I think it might be possible to get the the original USD as the basis.
Sure, you still track/report the intermediate trades (BTC-&gt;ALT), but when you do so, you need to assign a fair market value to BTC and the ALT. During times of extreme volatility (like now), it is difficult to pick a single exact value for each asset. Coupled with the fact that ALTs have low liquidity and simply trading them causes the price the fluctuate significantly.
Ultimately, since you need to pick FMV, you can just choose the FMV that meets your original basis. 
I think ultimately this should be acceptable because you're not actually making a real gain or loss if you're converting the original USD fully to ALT. You would ultimately cancel out any gains or losses anyway.
