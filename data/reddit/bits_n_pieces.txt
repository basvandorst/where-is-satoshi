Great work! Loved it!!

It would be a killer if it works with 0 or 1 confirmation.
Bitpay usually wait for 6 don't they?

Thanks guys!

I think it is because he is on a bad connection.
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:07:02
I love the concept, but how would this work? Wouldn't this mean there would be no mining of new coins on the sidechains? How would their blockchains be kept secure? Transaction fees?
@_date: 2014-06-12 07:29:51
I think you pretty much got it right.
@_date: 2014-10-25 04:53:53
There would be a different girl on the stage by the time 6 confirmations take place. Maybe you charge you account with bitcoin, then make it rain as you please.
@_date: 2014-07-22 03:50:37
It can't really vanish because the code has been downloaded onto thousands of computers already. If it stops getting maintained, switch to a new wallet.

I would appreciate if you could explain why not reusing addresses can protect somebody from such an attack. I understand this is a good practice to keep your transactions more private, but isn't your public key broadcast to the network, the second you send coins to it? What is the difference if you only spend from it once?
@_date: 2014-12-04 14:18:19
Just a little over 1 transaction per second.

“I’m gonna predict that amazon.com is going to be accepting Bitcoin by the end of this year”  Wow!
@_date: 2014-10-25 06:18:47
I see, thanks.
@_date: 2014-07-03 11:10:49
These are really great ideas!

This list: 
should be enough to show who is ready for Segwit. It's the logo that I feel adds a layer of marketing to it.
@_date: 2017-02-22 06:39:59
I am talking about logos for proposals. Not features.
@_date: 2017-02-22 07:20:06
Code is code. Dressing up feature proposals with fancy logos in an open source software project just seems a bit "marketed" to me.
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:45:02
I believe what needs to be done is:
1: Backup your private keys.
2: Stop your wallet/client from broadcasting the transaction. ie. disconnect it from the network.
3: Import the private keys into a new wallet.
Can someone confirm this?
@_date: 2017-02-22 06:01:41
I don't get the comparison you're making.
@_date: 2017-02-22 09:58:49
It seems SegwitSF was the only option Core was willing to put on the table. And many people oppose it. If we had more options on the table that could be voted on, we probably wouldn't need all this branding in the first place.
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:10:34
Lets say there were only two people in the world, "Mr.A" and "Mr.B", and there was only $100 dollars in this world, and "Mr.A" had the $100 to begin with. "Mr.B" really wants the $100 so he builds "Mr.A" a house and receives the $100 dollars as payment. There is now $200 dollars of value in the system. The $100 dollars, and the house which is worth $100. This continues as "Mr.A" now goes out and builds a house for "Mr.B" and receives the same $100 dollars as payment. There is now $300 dollars of value in the system. The point is that when you pay somebody something for something, you usually receive something of value in return.
best way I got my head around it..
@_date: 2017-02-23 06:12:22
What I am saying is that many people oppose SegwitSF. Somebody is spending a lot money to promote it. It is a part of Bitcoin Core and they will not consider any other options other then the ones they have decided on. This move is also being funded. This is an open source project. Somebody is using money to take Bitcoin in a direction that "they" feel is correct. This is being done through marketing rather then open community discussion.
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:35:49


So it should be decided centrally?


Not according to the hash rate.
@_date: 2017-02-22 09:15:04
And then I find this:
@_date: 2017-02-22 06:11:33
Clients that support specific features have logos. Not the features themselves.
@_date: 2017-02-22 11:37:20
There are many proposals that are very powerful upgrades to Bitcoin. I'm just saying I don't see websites for Flexible Transactions or Adaptive Blocksize Limit etc.
@_date: 2017-02-22 06:00:44
It's just that I don't see logos coming from other proposals like "Bigger Blocks" or "Hard Fork Capacity Increase". That brings me to my original question. Why does a proposal need a logo?
@_date: 2015-01-28 06:50:55
I would also like some clarity on this issue.
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:04:29
Great talk regarding the matter:
And also coming..
@_date: 2017-02-22 09:10:41
well, obviously
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:59:26
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:58:29
I totally agree with you. This post makes no rational sense. It seems more like character attack.

fun thought!

@_date: 2017-03-30 15:22:38
Because they want a blocksize increase before an Altcoin eats Bitcoin's lunch. What else would you do?
@_date: 2017-02-22 09:44:25
Sure, after it's activated.
@_date: 2017-02-22 06:54:34
Well yes it is a feature. A feature which requires a majority consensus to activate (proposal).
edit: wording
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:59:41
I see, thanks.
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:03:11
But isn't the data suggesting that 4MB is currently safe?
@_date: 2016-03-13 15:24:15
Even if currently the maximum is 4MB, isn't it safe to say that in the future with better technology, that maximum safe limit will also increase?
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:50:29
Lobbying, Lol. What about the closed door meetings the Core Devs had with the miners during the "Hong Kong agreement". This sub is is so funny.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:22:21


Lol again! Are you saying creating a fee market by artificially limiting the blocksize isn't introducing new and unpredictable game theory to Bitcoin. How can anyone take these arguments seriously?
