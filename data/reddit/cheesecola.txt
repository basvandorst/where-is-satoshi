Another way of looking it at (using your example):
One of McDonald's partners decided he wanted to sell hot dogs instead of burgers. The other partner didn't agree since burgers are what made McDonald so great. So he went and made a 'McDonalds Burgers' which sells burgers. While the first partner kept McDonalds as the name but sells hot dogs.

The road + transport analogy is flawed on many levels to make a direct comparison to cryptocurrency.
But one thing that could be said is that LN are like airplanes, in the manner that they cost millions of dollars to buy and will lead to *much* higher centralization.
So while it may be cheaper to fly with a plane from one city to another - only a few large companies will ever provide this service - and as history has shown, airlines will do everything in their power to increase their profits - smaller seats, higher fees, refusal of service, overbooking flights.

I have a question for you to ask yourself: Why are you okay with a 2 hour confirmation and 9$ fee over 5 minute confirmation and 1 cent fee - that can be supported *right now* with bigger blocks?

It would, although once you get a better connection it would take less ... whats your point!

Yes that's the way Bitcoin works right now - but it doesn't have to - it *can* be cheap and fast.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:04:10
Math time.
For a measly 15,000BTC you can bring the price of bitcoin to $3000 on GDAX. 
GDAX makes up 6% of the trade volume.
Meaning selling 250,000 BTC can bring the bitcoin "market cap" of $270 billion to $60 billion.
Funnily enough $800mil at $3k/btc is ~250,000BTC.

Yea but I'm talking about Average Joe, who uses his credit card to solve all those problems right now. HE trusts banks today, I agree he will wake up in the future when he gets bitten and finds out money in the bank, is not his money - just like Cyprus - but until then, there is no point in convincing Average Joe to *use* Bitcoin. Especially when the value is so volatile, any swing in the wrong direction will cause him to lose trust in Bitcoin, and TRUST is what Bitcoin should aim at maximizing right now.
Basically bitcoin will take off when the FED screws Average Joe over - until then, bitcoin awareness is what needs to be promoted.
@_date: 2017-01-14 11:01:33

Apart from the speculation aspect of course. Why should they use Bitcoin right now.

It's an exponential line fitting the trend of bitcoins growth ignoring the obvious 2013 bubbles.
Sure it may turn into a bubble, but exponential exponential growth isn't sustainable, it'll still correct to the trend line.

Sorry to burst your bubble but until bitcoin can be used offline without ever needed to have another node confirm a transaction it will never be a cash replacement.
This is also, by the way, the reason bitcoin can never scale like paper cash today.

Just as I thought, full of shit.
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:21:16
What I see is a lot of actual users of the Bitcoin, no not HODLers, people who actually use crypto as a day to day tool to get paid for services online, are changing to other crypto because they can not *depend* on Bitcoin when it hits scaling issues (conf time/fees).
It's the same reason Kraken is losing marketshare to Bitstamp, after a while people will prefer something else.
I personally find myself using Litecoin more and more - it's widely accepted, is almost never disabled/down, and stable - there won't be crazy price swings while the money is in transit.
The way I see it - Bitcoin could increase block size to solve the "right now" problem of scaling, giving it room to breath until layered payment tech is completed, as Cash has done. A 4MB block limit wouldn't be so bad in the grand scheme of things as it would be temporary and would 100% solidify Bitcoin as crypto king.
There is also a ton of c*nsoring going on around here which is never healthy as it sweeps real problems under the rug.

Not a good idea for Bitcoin in the long run though, people like familiar things, if they change to something else and it solves their problem, they won't have a reason to change back even if stuff is 'fixed' in the other one.

Bitcoin's correct growth is exponential, but bubbles are exponentially exponential.
It's crystal clear on this chart (log scale):
See the 3 larger mountains - those are big bubbles - and there are a few small ones here and there. They don't follow a straight line of regular exponential growth.
As I said I didn't sell at the ATH - I sell on bad news - and bitcoin is full of it. Then buy when there is no news.

As someone who's been through many bitcoin bubbles, you haven't missed anything, and no, 2.5K isn't the floor.
The thing is you probably won't have the balls to buy when it does reach those levels, they call it despair for a reason. After a few months, your get rich quick interest in bitcoin will have faded entirely.
