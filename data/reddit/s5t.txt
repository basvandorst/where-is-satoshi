No, but you can talk to suppliers. They might or might not want to accept Bitcoin. Just try.

It was down for only few minutes.

You should have reported this ad to Google.

One guy compared Bitcoin to internet, as technology that got so widely adopted to show that it's possible that Bitcoin can become so popular as well. Someone else  compared Bitcoin to Segway to show, that even if something is hot right now doesn't have to become world wide hit that everyone will use.
Point is that it's hilarious to think that Bitcoin will succeed and become very popular just because internet became so popular.

I don't print them myself. I live in Poland and it would cost a lot to ship them to US (and also pracel might get lost). They are printed in Los Angeles by [Printful]( so quality is amazing and shipping is fast and secure.
Also, you might want to pick color yourself on their website. I sent you New Silver one. They have plenty of them, if you like one of them you can tell me which one, I will create mockups so you will see how they look like with QR codes.
You can choose colors [there](

I will send you all files needed for printing via PM (artwork, print files + mockups). You probably don't want to have your private key public (yet).
When ordering mark it as sample order (you will get 20% discount, you can make 3 such orders a month).

Same goes for Bitcoin, but it's still close :D
@_date: 2016-07-03 14:01:37
I created [mockups]( for you.
Do you like them? They would be printed on American Apparel T-Shirt.
Sadly, it costs $21.85 to just print them (printing on both sides costs more).
@_date: 2016-07-03 09:17:47
I think I get it. Also I think I will create request thread soon!

Do you mean just the logo on shirt? It would be pretty easy to do yourself or if you want to buy it bitgear sells such shirts. 
I want to collect some ideas so I might add this idea with shuttle with that text too.  It might take some time as I work on OpenBazaar android app atm.

Thanks,  great idea. I will try do something nice at the weekend.

Reddit took post image from my github avatar. It's not t-shirt design. 
My avatar is Epigram (name of latest Gramatik album, when you download it,  you can create Epigram (like my avatar) with your text). Gramatik makes his albums totally free and he accepts Bitcoin donations so you can check him out!

As you requested (and as white on black QR codes are not scannable in most Bitcoin address) I made white variant with some real wallet codes on it.
@_date: 2016-07-03 09:19:07
I might create one for you. Just PM me how you would like it to look like if you have any specific idea.

This was just random QR Code I found. I didn't want to put any wallet keys on that mockup. I will PM you with mockup with actual public and private keys.
@_date: 2016-07-02 22:49:04
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:51:45
With public key on front and private key on back. This could be the most expensive shirt you ever had.
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:31:35
I created store after I published these designs,  but I appreciate it! Thanks.
