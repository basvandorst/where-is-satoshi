I ordered a miner from ButterFly Labs # months ago.&amp; Transaction ID #  &amp; I have not recived any word on it even being shipped. i would like my&amp; put back into my account. i fear this business is a scam and are violating your TOS by not shipping anything. My order number from BFL is&amp; has stated they&amp; not provide a refund although they have not shipped the product. To me that is FRAUD. please help me with&amp; you can reach me by phone at
