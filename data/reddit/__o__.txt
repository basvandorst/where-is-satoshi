Since when is giving a software user who operates a client more options considered an attack?  The default setting in BU is the same as Core.  Miners have to make a choice.  If there are valid reasons to increase the block size and a majority of miners do so, then that is the consensus.  Just like if a super-majority choose SegWit.

If you only use bitcoin to diversify your investments or to get rich you don't really know it. I want to use something other than fiat.  Its a fiasco.  I don't want to get involved with banks if I can avoid it.  If there is a superior currency, a digital cash for as many payments as I need then my preference would be to use that.  When an idealistic concept such as bitcoin is successfully deployed it makes you feel good inside as you transact with it.  People who travel internationally have some good use cases.  If I had more disposable income I would probably gamble a little with it and donate to some third-world charity overseas.  Its the plethora of subversive applications which make bitcoin so delightful.
@_date: 2017-01-17 22:46:04
I hope the price continues to rise, mostly because that is what bitcoin does.  If it doesn't continue to rise it may indicate there are problems.  However I would never believe bitcoin failed just because it returned to a price of US$500 or even US$100.

This is unlike cash or visa where I just pay without thinking about how necessary that transaction is depending on the payment method.

Maybe its Soros pulling the strings and maybe Putin is yanking on Soros's chain.  Or maybe a group of developers have coalesced around a rare opportunity to shape bitcoin to their benefit.  Out of the three scenarios one seems more likely.

Eventually the agitators from both sides will realise what you have writen is the best way forward.  Its the science that proves, demonstrates and persuades not words alone.  The bitcoin arena is dominated by nerdy males.
Technically dense matters expressed via individuals who's communications skills have been honed by smaller audiences are bound to be partially ineffective.  This sort of ego-based combat around a best way forward division is a healthy sign even if its not immediately helpful.

It doesn't prove that, no.  A ban on bitcoin would be as effective as copyright laws are against copyright infringement.  Online file-sharing is rampant, widespread and chronic.  If the government makes a fuss about it, then it will only make people more aware of bitcoin's usefulness.

I can't see the problem here.  I can detect a lot of angst.  Is it bitterness, jealousy or are there a lot of angry people who want to blame things like hacks or Mt Gox on him?  I appreciate how he is out there, actively doing things and engaging in what he thinks is important. He just wants a healthy bitcoin ecosystem and spends his bitcoin to do that.  We have alternative software clients - is that a bad thing?  I agree with him on fees while I don't agree with some other things he has said.

@_date: 2016-12-08 12:02:01
Ideally I think nodes should give weight to transactions without fees after some time.  That way low priority or micropayments which would be uneconomic if they included a fee would not be penalised.  Its not convenient to have to look up what the best fee is when using bitcoin.  Could we create an incentive for this so the network caters for everyone?

I am suggesting that when one bitcoin is priced at US$1,000 it could be an apt time if you are fortunate enough to be able to make a bitcoin donation to charity or someone less well off.  I also wonder if advocates of bitcoin should make events for the times the bitcoin blockchain reaches a height of 500,000 and one million.

@_date: 2016-12-04 04:19:52
So you believe one attack vector for bitcoin is through poor user operational security at the node level, a mass remote exploit via an operating system which could temporarily take out enough nodes to cripple the network?  You also believe the network could become more vulnerable to this as the blockchain grows.
@_date: 2016-12-08 11:30:11
That is very suggestive but its not an assessment of the adoption scale.  Couldn't it just as easily drop off when things settle down in India or is there a growing consensus that a structural shift towards crypto is being inadvertently created by the Indian government?

I'm not disputing your premise. Journalists are more establishment managers than investigators. I am asking for examples of fake news that push the narrative you speak of.
I see oddities in journalism and mass media all the time.  An example from many is that I have problems when media focus on criminal trials and report intricate details of what was said in ongoing trials.
“The role of the media corporations in the US is similar to that of repressive state regimes elsewhere: they decide what the public will and won't be allowed to hear, and either punish or recruit the social deviants who insist on telling a different story.  The journalists they employ do what almost all journalists working under repressive regimes do: they internalize the demands of the censor, and understand, before anyone has told them, what is permissible and what is not.” – George Monbiot
“The campaign against Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 is indicative. The film is not radical and makes no outlandish claims; what it does is push past those guarding the boundaries of “respectable“ dissent. That is why the public applauds it. It breaks the collusive codes of journalism, which it shames. It allows people to begin to deconstruct the nightly propaganda that passes for news.” – John Pilger

What makes you excited about Bitcoin?  Identify these things down to their absolutes.  Focus on the top three aspects that you believe the majority of Bitcoin users may also appreciate.  Develop tools that will assist adoption based on the attributes you identify.  If others are developing the same tools try to join their effort.  Re-assess after a period time and go back to the first step.

Since Core's use is voluntary and there are alternatives the premise of your comment is invalid.  If Core was really a problem for the network then why is it so popular with miners?
@_date: 2016-12-27 11:45:38
The primary thing that matters regarding Bitcoin's energy use is miners' use of renewable energy.  Anything else is inappropriate.
Personally I would like to see a hemispheric division where the Northern Hemisphere does most mining around Christmas when its cold and the southern vice versa.
I gather the move towards domestic heater-miners has faded as the difficulty increased and mining centralised.

What have these minor punitive measures got to do with the chronic, rampant and widespread piracy that occurs online?  Its like you are implying Bitcoin will fail because a few developers, investors and advocates are punished or something.  First, people have to commit a crime to be punished.  Second that isn't going to stop mining all around the world.  You think people are going to dispose of their bitcoin or something?
