GDAX will support the fork. Once the forke happend they will name the current chain BTC and the segwit2x chain B2X for at least two weeks.

after the split a new wallet can only hold coins from one side of the chain?

what wallet would you recommend? currently i am using jaxx
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:07:06
this whole fork thing is kinda confusing. how can i identify coins from the different chains?
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:12:39
I guess we have to live with the fees for now
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:11:11
They should also sell the place for Bitcoin

I guess that makes sense. But if the fees don't change then there will be fewer people paying with Bitcoin. I don't know if there are some extra costs involved to receive Bitcoin payments as a business (like setting everything up, selling Bitcoin to pay employees, ...) but if there are then it might not be lucrative for them to keep accepting Bitcoin.

Then why are some restaurants and takeaway places accepting Bitcoin? Most of them don't sell very expensive products.
Also other coins are not very popular compared to Bitcoin so buying something is almost impossible.

The 3.87$ are transaction fees. You have to pay them to the miners to include your transaction in a block.

Sadly it is difficult to buy a coffee with ETH

Thanks for explaining the situation. Now I know that it is not easy to find a solution and it is even harder for everyone to agree.
I guess we have to wait and see.

yes i know the basics. 
I want to buy Bitcoin because i think it is the currency of the future.
I just wanted to know if it is better to buy bevor the fork and have coins on both sides or buy after the fork wenn the prices might be lower
Edit: I want to hold Bitcoin

thx for the reply

10-20$ is less than the 0.01 BTC minimum, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:59:55
thanks, that is the best answer i got

Where should I store my Bitcoins during the fork? Currently I'm using Jaxx on my PC. 
Should I move my coins to a paper wallet before the fork and sweep them a few days after the fork? 
Or would you recommend using different wallet for example Copay? 
Currently I don't own a hardware wallet, I ordered one but it will not arrive before the forks
