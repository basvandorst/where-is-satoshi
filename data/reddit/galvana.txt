Correction happened when 11k fell to 8k - might happen again soon, might not. Either way a 30% correction is very extreme even for bitcoin so we'd still likely be higher than a week ago.

No real "how you do it" method, depends on how much you're willing to risk. Only invest what you're willing to completely lose and if you want to be safe, take out initial investments so you're only riding on gains

If it crashes 40% - which is a big fucking crash - it’s still higher than it was a week ago. 
If you buy in now and it rises to $20k, and it crashes, you’ll still probably have a net gain.

Bitcoin is a new type of investment. Never done before, no historical working historical analysis. It's new territory, and some people can make some general analysis but it's, for the most part, impossible to predict. You can say it will go up more but it can crash tomorrow, it can crash 10 years from now. It could go down to $2K next month. It could rise up to $20K next month. 
No analysis is completely trustworthy. No analysis is completely correct. It's a massively high risk, massively high reward investment. 
I bought in late to the game at $8K. At the time people told me it was stupid to buy into it. But it's getting more traction now and it's rising rapidly. If I ever make a 100% gain after taxes (so more like 125% gain), I will sell the original amount and offset for taxes and keep the rest for a few years until it rises high enough for me to be satisfied, and I'll take money out slowly. 
If you are going to invest, do not wait for a drop. If I waited for a drop at $8K, it would have gone to $9K, and then $10K, and I would have lost a potential 20% gain. Understand the risks, invest into it at any time, and pray it goes up. 
This is gambling, but safer than regular gambling. Think of it as a coin flip. On one side you lose 90% of your money. On the other side you gain 1,000%. Decide based on your risk/reward ratio to see how much you want to put into it. I put $2,000 but many people put way more than that (or way less). 
I would recommend you to have a lot of self-control. I used to do short-term stock trades and while risky investors make large percentages and can triple their money in a year, you can't compare yourself with them because your risk threshold is different. 
I made myself a few rules. Once I can make my money back after taxes, I'm taking that amount out so I will never lose money from playing into Bitcoin. Then, I'll take it out in increments of about $1,000 as it's being made, but only after the 300% mark. 
I might lose a lot of gains from that but the idea is to not regret those gains and just be happy about the gains that DO happen.
