There was a post on the front page not to long ago about how redditors never actually read the articles. Just read the titles and upvote or downvote accordingly.

I also came here to see if anyone else was getting a Username and Password prompt.

Its a good choice. Using obsolete media to store private keys. Anyone who would try to steal them would have to go way out of their way to even try and get them

That's what I thought exactly. Theres a sell wall of 3400 bcash when I checked.

This is the most I ever seen

Honest question. So you been trading using coinbase. Does that imply that used GDAX as well or are you strictly comparing Gemini to coinbase?

Coinbase Back up now

Not to mention that $3,500 at about $19,000 is about .184 BTC. Right now it's at 13k, which if he bought right now it would cost him $2,400. He's eating a $1100 loss. 
I'd he would have just let his father sell that low and used the $3,500 to buy at current market price, he would have .269 BTC.

From my experience its just better to hodl. Every time I sell thinking its pretty high, it just goes way up. When I try to buy when it goes low its never as low as when I sold it.
 
Example: bought at 5,000, sold at 7,000. Went up to 7500 bought back when it was 7,200.
I did get lucky and sold at 11,000 and bought back when it was around 9k the other day.

Yea that's a big red flag. They were able to change your password so they probably have access to your email. It would be a good idea to change your email password as well.

I came here to say this. I always buy on coinbase pro, and even buying at market price, I was getting more BTC/dollar compared to Cash app.

Yea but people know Banksy. So if you were to put it in the title it's more likely to be upvoted. And someone in the comment is more than likely will correct them.

I just want that new Tesla Roadster.

Or when it hit over 19k? thats almost 10x over what he initially paid.

Brb about to start a new ICO and call it GOAT. Thanks Ellen.

Yea I wish I could understand what he was originally laughing about.
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:00:45
No, because the difficulty increases based on the hash rate.

Actually right now is really good time to trade Bcash for BTC. Last week it was going for about .09500 to under .10000 and now its trading for almost .12995

Ok, I can help. First do you still have your old phone with the original Google Authenticator App? Because that is what you're going to need to access your account. Your new phone wont have the same code as the old phone unless you saved and used the same secret key that coinbase generated when you used with your old phone.
