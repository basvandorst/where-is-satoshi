Did you really think we want those laws observed?" said Dr. Ferris. "We want them to be broken. You'd better get it straight that it's not a bunch of boy scouts you're up against... We're after power and we mean it... There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced or objectively interpreted – and you create a nation of law-breakers – and then you cash in on guilt. Now that's the system, Mr. Reardon, that's the game, and once you understand it, you'll be much easier to deal with.

If our current pace continues, it makes much more sense to buy as much as you can now.  Even if you buy on credit, your interest rates will be far outweighed by the increasing value of the coin.
Assuming it doesn't crash.

That doesnt matter at all. 
They dgaf about you.
All they have to do is make bitcoin scary and hard to use. And the vast majority of regular folks wont touch it. So it never grows in value, never becomes commonly used. Stays a little hobby for adventurous tech nerds.

It's not a left right thing. We're not even on the same axis. Libertarians will never bond with the current American left because their economic policies are unnaceptable to us. Many extremist libertarians do describe themselves as anarchists, because if less government is good, none must be best right? But that includes a complete free market. Which of course would leave room for voluntary socialist organizing, but not directed by the state.

This may be a shock to you, but most of us already do. The younger ones at least. Old fudds can fuck right off.
