It's not a payment system anymore. It's currently only good as a high risk store of value and/or high risk investment.
I have a horse in the BTC race and it pisses me off to no end that BTC is having the problems it is at the moment. Shit needs to change or another coin WILL take over. It won't be tomorrow, and it probably won't be next year but it's going to happen after that if things are fixed.

Why is everyone here being defensive and butt hurt about my comments? BTC is 90% of my crypto holdings. I love BTC. Been following it since the start.
That said I'm not going to come on this sub and make excuses for it. It needs to be improved or it will be replaced. I stand to lose a considerable amount of money by BTC falling out of favor. I'm not going to sit here and pretend everything's perfect.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:51:56
I'm not so sure. I haven't seen the blind following going on here.
I'm another big fan of BTC but I don't have my head in the sand. Looking at the comments in this thread it seems the vast majority of people don't either.

You're making a big mistake comparing fiat currency to currencies that are also commodity.
Just look at pre 1965 quarters and new ones. Same face value, same fiat backing. ones worth $.25 (because the .gov says so) and the others worth $3.00 (because the market says so).
The thing is Bitcoin cant be melted down and used as an industrial metal or a piece of jewelry.
We are in some majorly uncharted waters and BTC already starting to fail at being a currency is not a good thing. BTC needs to be fixed immediately to be allowed to be used as both a currency and store of value. If it doesnt, something else will take its place. The market isnt going to put up with bullshit indefinitely.

The problem is that BTC was never intended to be a stand alone investment instrument. It wasnt really intended to be that at all, actually.
The real problem is we can't use BTC for it's original intention. We can pump BTC to the moon in the meantime but eventually it is going to come back down to Earth if BTCs actual use is not realised.

BTC can only get so far as an investment instrument. It needs to be other things beside a store of value if it's ever going to survive and or remain top dog.

This is wrong.
People think that they have to buy an entire BTC to get into the game. When they think this they stop researching as they've already decided they are priced out.
We need to get them the important facts before they give up.
I know this is a real problem because I have spoken to MANY people in person about this who thought they had to buy and entire coin and said F' it and never looked back.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:13:57
Yeah I'm sure.
Most people do not own BTC still. When the general public starts buying BTC for a store of value and or use it will start to bubble without a doubt. 
BTC is in a huge hype situation right now and could drop like it has in the past but since it's gaining traction I think it's going to keep growing in the short/mid term.

People get careless and get hacked due to easy passwords. People also go to similarly named URLs and get phished.

the FDIC covers your fiat up to $250,000 with Coinbase.

I don't think so, but I think it would be interesting a decade or so down the road for their to be some sort of audit on the block chain to see when the past time BTCs were spotted. Could put a rough estimate on how much is either lost or in deep hibernation. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:22:28
Wow. OK, lets do this again since the comment I replied to has deleted itself.
Fiat currency used by coinbase; the US Dollar (at least for me), is insured by the FDIC. Don't believe me? Who cares. They are insured by the FDIC in regards to the USD.
Coins, as is Cryptocurrency, as in BTC, LTC and ETH are insured by a private insurance company. Understand?
Since you couldn't be bothered to either read, understand or care enough to read my entire post, I'll even link the FAQ right here so you can be prepared to be amazed. (I googled "coinbase insurance" and the page I am going to link was the 1st result. I know, a lot of work.)
But wait, are you going to click that link? Are you still even reading this or are you replying that Coinbase isnt insured? I'll cut and past it.
"All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result.
The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft."
"If you are a United States resident, your Coinbase USD Wallet is covered by FDIC insurance, up to a maximum of $250,000."
Amazing. I know. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:00:14
If their systems are destroyed they are insured. If they are hacked they are insured.
Fiat is protected under the FDIC.
The best thing I've ever done was get my wallet out of my physical control. After several near misses I had enough of it. Luckily I have triple redundant backups and the 3rd one happened to eventually come into play. After that I was done with it.
If someone wants to break into my account now they are going to need my credentials plus the authenticator. It's not a simple task and I am satisfied with that level of security.
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:32:56

Dude come on.
Fiat is insured by the FDIC up to $250,000. Coins are insured by a privately purchased insurance company and cover all coin losses that are the result of coin bases actions (or inactions).
All this shit is right on their page for anyone to read. 
mtgox's CEO was and probably still is a mess of epic proportions. His direct leadership style was directly linked to the problems that mt gox had. Again, all of this is well documented and not a secret.
Coinbase is a legit company that has enough competence for private insurers to insure their holdings. MtGox wasn't.
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:07:12
Coinbase is insured. As long as you as the user can keep your credentials and authenticators safe, you're good.
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:47:29
You are going to have two sides to the story. On one side you will have people who store their coins at home. You'll see many posts about people losing these. 
On the other side, you'll see people keeping their coins on an insured exchange. You'll see many posts about people who failed to set up 2 factor authentication and who were phished and had their accounts cleaned out.
The hardware wallet has its downsides just like having it on some place like coinbase. Coinbase is insured, so on their end you are covered. Like the hardware wallet, it boils down to your ability to keep the hardware wallet safe or the account strong enough online.

@_date: 2017-11-27 19:04:58
It's completely up to the user. If either are done correctly it is a good bet. Coinbase isn't Mt. Gox, so that's a start.
Paper wallets at home solutions are fine - when managed correctly. Many a horror story has already appeared here from both people losing their coins/accounts on exchanges and losing access to paper wallets for X reason.
Want BTC to keep taking off? Thank Coinbase. Want LTC to keep taking off? Thank Coinbase. Want Etheruem to keep taking off? Thank Coinbase. 
While CB has it's problems the amount of shit it catches from this sub is insane. CB is the entryway to mainstream for BTC/LTC/ETH in the US and maybe the West in general. 
Instead of attacking it ad nauseum I'd wish we'd talk about it and at least to pretend to be objective about it and see CB for the blessing it is - allowing everyone to enter the arena easily and without to much bullshit.
reply is cliche. Buy BTC, move it to a paperwallet. Then no one ever tells that newbie wtf that actually is, how to do it, how to safeguard it, etc etc. If we are going to give people the minimum amount of advice we'd just be better off telling them to keep in on CB where they can only lose it via phishing.

Coinbase fucked up huge with that B2X situation. No doubt about it. Big mistake, dumb policy and luckily a mess avoided. 
That said they still are doing the casual crypto community a huge favor by providing an ultra friendly front end to new users.
If CB pulls another stunt like B2X I will start jumping ship, but Christ, people make mistakes and fuck up.

That's defiantly the issue. And a lot of the Coinbase "problems" are from people doing things that they shouldn't be doing, break the ToS or are lying.
We had a popular anti coinbase thread here last week that was an obvious made up story attempting to phish an account here on reddit. It was the most retarded thing I've seen here in awhile.
When I read the OP's sensational words, I thought to myself "is it in Coinbases interests to destroy/damage BTC?" The answer is no. BTC is there bread and butter. If they damage it, destroy it or lessen it in anyway they hurt their business.
There's always 2+ sides to every story. While upgrade we just skipped was a bug turd for sure, the shit that people say/do here is so subjective and filled with ulterior motives its retarded.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:33:54
Just as an FYI to people new to this and using the authenticator ( you should be!).
Print out the seed code. Just the code, no explanation on the page. Put that some where safe. You'll be happy when you run into a situation like the OP has run into.
I suspect coinbase support may think his account is being phished or stolen via other misc social exploitation. The old "my phone number is messed up please help" is a very common technique used to break into accounts.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:59:39

But the insurance guarantees the coins, so there's that.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:09:02
If Coinbase gets comprimised you are covered by their insurance.
if your account gets compromised (you get hacked, phished, etc) it's on you. That said, Coinbase gives you so many options to safeguard your account that if you ended up getting phished you were beyond hope in the 1st place.
All of this stuff is in their ToS, which is easy to find. 
People here love to shit on CB for being insecure or X problem, but Coinbase has a lot more safeguards than the computers I used in the military with a secret clearance log in wise. Let that be food for thought.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:07:41
Ignoring your strawman, the fact remains that the branding/sizing we use is confusing to almost everyone not in BTC.

@_date: 2017-11-15 02:35:22
No, it doesn't. I think there is more to the OPs story than is being told.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:07:23
The reason why there are problems is because if it can break it will break. It may not break today, tomorrow or next week but it's going to break.
When you scale a system to the size of something coinbase uses, then throw in the layers of security, auditing and the rest, things are going to break a lot. 
Most of the shit that breaks can be fixed quickly and easily. Sometimes it can't. Occasionally something major breaks and backups have to be rolled out. Or huge patches have to be added in to fix a problem. Other times one thing will break and it will cascade into some retarded monster of a problem.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:42:44
Anarchy? Give me a break. 6 people control BTC.
6 people running a system that is accessible (potentially) to 7,600,000,000 people is not "Anarchy Governance." 
It is the most tightly controlled oligarchy in the world. Which is a bad thing for people without a clue. The fact that so little people have so much power is one of the few things that makes me a little unsure about BTC's future. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:11:23
Want BCH to go away? Support the changes and fixes that make BTC the best coin to use. And no, I'm not saying that BCH is better than BTC. I'm just pointing out that BTC has problems that need to be fixed, like yesterday.
I hold a good amount of BTC and a tiny amount of BCH. That said, as we all know, BTC is next to useless for day to day transactions. The people who bought BTC to get rich quick and make money don't care about that. The people who want to use it for its actual intended purpose do.

That's basically it.
People get phished, give out every single friggen bit of info humanly possible to a phishing site, get hacked and then come on reddit to complain about how much exchanges suck.
If you get phished on coinbase you seriously need to learn how to use the internet. You have to make huge mistake after huge mistake in a tiny time frame in order to get cleaned out.

Don't listen to it. Don't send money or receive it from known bad addresses. Don't break their ToS (like buying illegal shit with the money right off the exchange).
Coinbase is a legit company. The IRS audits them. They are a bank also, and have to go by US banking law. So if you want to use coinbase to buy drugs, launder money or other misc illegal thing, and I think weirdly porn (dumb, i know) then it's not for you.
Otherwise it's a safe insured place.
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:20:19
I suspect they will do something similar to the Bitcoin Cash decision if the new fork takes off in any capacity. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:22:47
I'm sure there's a reason. But how often do people come here and say they know why, or at least have any sort of clue?
Coinbases CS may or may not suck. I'm not going to defend it because CS's are typical meh to begin with. If your account is locked than Coinbase should be notifying you in writing either by email or snail mail immediately. If they aren't (and i don't think they are) then they are wrong and should immediately address it.
Same goes with investigations. Bank bitches about it? Notify client, conduct investigation immediately, come to a solution. They shouldn't have people on ice for a month. That's BS and I'm not going to defend that either.
As for the rest of the "no reason" complaints we see, I suspect a lot of them do have reasons and a lot of the people who say they don't know why probably do. They aren't telling us the reason because people aren't going to feel bad for them and support them.
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:34:46
I agree that coinbase is definitely apart of this problem.
That said, releasing BCH was the right thing to do. The lack of coins that CB offers is a bad thing, not a good thing. Letting people dump shit coins via forks is a good thing.
Everyone here wants the free market (till they get scammed or fucked by a big player) and everyone here wants financial freedom (only if its the coin that comes after I personally don't see how or why BCH is going to be around much longer. BTC will kill it just by existing, even with it's epic level modern day problems with are on the verge of a crisis.
The BTC vs BCH thing has turned into a partisan and or sports team fan issue. It's just 2 pools of people fighting over crap not seeing the big picture. May the best coin win (I think it will be BTC simply due to it being bigger and 1st.)

Like others have said, the 2 people I am thinking of are probably full of it and dont actually want to buy. One of them is currently blaming his bank for not allowing him to buy on coinbase and another is saying he has cashed out all of his stocks to buy BTC, then admitted he only bought $50 worth, and now wont say how much he owns because I suspect his wife made him sell what he bought.

I own more BTC than gold. That said my gold at the moment is way more liquid and tradable than BTC.
Will gold be replaced? We'll see, probably. But gold is still higher on the hill than BTC.
BTC's biggest issues now are few places to spend it and wild value swings. When those are addressed BTC will take off.

Bankers are panicking? I just lost a few thousand dollars in a week. I don't think the bankers are the one sweating it.

I hold gold, silver and crypto. I think in an end of the world scenario gold would be the best bet for me personally.
A 1 once gold coin is small, about the size of 2 stacked quarters. It's not something that is difficult to defend and it is something that is recognized by every human on earth as being valuable.

I agree that its moving cashless but for me it's moving towards credit cards that I can use to abuse the point systems. 
What's my incentive to use BTC when I can use my Chase cards and fly for free? BTC is fantastic for places like Venezuela who have hyperinflation and an economic trainwreck of epic proportions.
Right now in the states I have very few places that take BTC, my complete refusal to use any of it since I am making bank on holding it and no incentive bonus wise for actually using it at the moment.
I think BTC or another coin will take off, but not for the reasons people think. Especially in a strong western economy. The masses are plenty happy with credit.

Don't you think the environment that BTC is a little different now than it was 4 years ago?

As much as I like BTC, comparing it to a failed states currency is nothing no brag about.

I cant wait for all of us to "hodl" so we create such a massive bubble that we all lose big when it pops. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:36:23
You are correct. If adoption and actual use doesn't pick up the bubble will pop and most of us will lose our asses.
This bullshit "HODL" mentality only causes hording which leads to shit like bubbles. If BTC is to take off it needs to be very liquid. It's not.
All the people saying hold are the people who are putting this into danger the most.

I'm not going to let rumors and other bullshit push me around. Coinbase is in the game to make money. They are a for profit US based business that has to answer to US based AG complaints, lawsuits and other shit that people are going to throw against them if they play games.
Pissing off their customer base, stealing, playing games and the rest aren't going to net them money. It wasn't to long ago that Coinbase was going to steal all our Bitcoin Cash also according to everyone.
They could make a bad move and rip people off or play dirty bit it isnt going to work well for them. They still have a decent reputation in the Cryto world I see no reason for them to tarnish it over bullshit.

dude for real? Are we really going to pretend that BTC is more liquid than a gold coin? 
I can't think of ONE place in my area (Boston area) that I shop at that even takes any sort of crypto. Are they out there? Sure. Do I know about any of them? No. Do stores take gold? Obviously not, but there are plenty of places to instantly cash it out and everyone on the planet understands that gold holds value. For reasons. Golds not used as a currency either it's a store of value for better or worse. One thing gold does have going for it as a store is it's a lot less volatile than BTC at the moment.
As soon as stores start taking BTC this entire thing will change. Peter Schiff will finally have the shut the fuck up about it and we will all win. But I'm not going to pretend that BTC is better or bigger than gold when only a tiny percentage of the population holds any and next to no one uses it as a currency.
Sure, I can cash out my BTC to my bank account just like you, but that BTC still remains virtually unspendable for day to day transactions and is also not recognized as a currency by the majority of the population. We will get there, but I'm not pretending we have won the battle.
Don't get me wrong. I want BTC to take off and I think it most likely will. That said I'm not drinking the kool-aide and mashing caps lock to type out "HODL" every chance I get like half this sub does.
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:07:02
One thing you'll see here is people making false comments about Coinbase that go directly against easily found links that say otherwise.
CB isn't perfect but if you set up your account security correctly it's very safe.

Youre giving the media way to high of expectations.
These people are put on camera and expected to have conversations about whatever topic they are told to talk about or have to via organic conversations. If they don't know it, they are going to fake it.
Same thing goes for the media with guns in the US. They have to talk about it due to the news and most of them have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. 
Since these people are getting paid either way they arent going to bother to learn more as theres no gain for them.

BTC and the potential for theft, being lost or misplaced is a bad thing about crytpo and a valid concern for people hesitant to join.
Making fun of people or attacking them for having legitimate concerns isnt going to make BTC any better.
I hold a decent sized amount of gold and silver coins and they are kept in an insured place.

Why is it that people who mention Coinbase hasn't been hacked yet fail to mention that Coinbase insures it's assets? Coinbase says in it's ToS that if you lose funds due to Coinbase you are covered.

The only thing that is going to get your coins in the Coinbase vault gone for good is you being phished beyond belief.
Have a strong password (which is phishable)
2 email addresses (phishable)
mobile authenticator (people probably could be fooled into giving the seeding code out)
if you give all 3 bits of those information out, yes you will be vulnerable. That said, if you comprise 2 email accounts, your coinbase account plus your mobile authenticator a physical wallet isnt going to help you either, as youre beyond help.
reddit cypto users hate keeping coins on exchanges. Thats the TLDR. I personally have zero problem with keeping coins on coinbase. I don't keep my USD under my mattress nor my bullion collection in my home.

I understand it and I don't think it's a good or bad thing. I do think it's a huge turn off to people, though.
The unregulated and decentralized nature doesn't appeal to the majority of people out there. People like shit like the FDIC, help numbers and a business who will eat a large financial loss for a customer to retain them as clients.
BTC is the wild west and the amount of people who actually believe in BTC as a currency is pretty small. I suspect most of the people here, myself included wouldn't be here if we weren't making an easy buck off the ride.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:08:04
Yep. Day after day on this sub and others we have people outright lying about coinbase, especially around it's insurance for the coins and FDIC coverage for fiat.
It seems a lot of people have no problem pretending neither exist and just continue to say how dangerous the place is to use.

The fact of the matter is when you shut down peoples accounts that have monetary assists in them you are playing a game by not telling them why. People are going to hound the shit out of a company who is holding their funds. It's one way to make the spam problem worse.
If my money was held up by Coinbase and I wasn't told why I would call up my AGs office. They are one of the most insanely heavy handed .gov organizations I've ever heard of or seen. They love to play games, and the prizes they hand out are fines and draconian regulation.
That said, I posted earlier that I suspect a lot of the people who have locked accounts have them locked for a very valid ToS violation, and these people are intentionally playing dumb about this.

RT has a really weird and complex marketing angel towards the west.
Most of their work is ultra slanted towards the East and the other work that does not appear to be obvious is geared to appeal towards certain political groups.
RT has big success with people who dislike the 2 party system, who dislike American imperialism/expansion, who dislike the federal reserve and or who dislike the US .gov in general.
People who are interested in Bitcoin are often found to at a minimum hate the federal reserve. RT is all about that.

And if it happens to Coinbase their holders are covered by Coinbases privately purchased insurance.
