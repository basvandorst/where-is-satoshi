Good example. Can you explain or link to some of the "human technology" aspects of Bitcoin that you think set it apart from other projects using the same technologies?

Most things worth saying have been written about before. I hoped you might know where in this case. No worries.
Maybe you could make a quick bullet list off the top of your head to help get me started?

How is that relevant? Did someone claim that "smart straight" is an oxymoron? I didn't see that anywhere.

Maybe "Money allows for happiness" would be a better statement?
I have enough money I don't have to think about it and I'm *much* happier than the rich people I know.
Or maybe "lack of money brings misery"? Because being poor sucks.

I'm pretty sure you have it backwards. Bitcoin was built using the idea of a  blockchain.

Bitcoin has a ton going for it indeed. I think we might disagree about what the word technology means though.

Oh, that's very cool. I thought they changed based on market price when your USD arrived on their end. I'll try this out.

I bring my fiat on the exchange and convert it to BTC right away. If there were a dip I'd be waiting another 5 to 8 days to transfer in more fiat before I could buy anything. Do people just keep a bunch of fiat on the exchanges?
