Thats what i was thinking, if lightning works do you then use the blockchain tps or assume a number based on channels etc? 
@_date: 2018-05-09 11:32:08


let me correct that for you


@_date: 2018-05-12 18:51:05


Yea sorry stopped reading there because you can't possibly think that's true.

Isn't everything traded on Wall Street in some way or another? How do you want to prevent that?

What are all those low key dumb questions? Do research before you spit out some buzzwords or put a little more effort in formulating your question, else I certainly won't put more effort in answering.

TBH never really lost any, I once payed 0,1 BTC for a 10$ game but I don't cosider that losing it

Just received my "I got lightning working" stickers,  I really like how well the stickers fit into the remaining space on my notebook cover. Next up in line is the genesis bag and a poster from bitcoinshirts, also payed via lightning.
Lightning is real and it works Ladies and Gentleman.

Because that's how it works. /s
People don't even think before they speak.
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:27:15
Sure they have, they would be dumb if they haven't \- even if they truely believe that it's not going to succeed. 
None of these people would miss out a chance of increasing a portfolio by 400&amp; a year even if it would mean they could loose it all because they all have high risk high reward investments anyways.

Listen. There is a big difference between coercive centralization and market\-based centralization.
Exchanges are centralized but you don't need them to own/buy/sell bitcoin, there are many P2P alternatives out there end even DEX's like bisq. Centralized Bitcoin Services exist only if the users decide to let them exist, not because they need to exist.
Mining decentralization is a problem yes, but again: mining doesn't need to be centralized and even more importantly is appreciated to be decentralized by the systems nature. If miners leave, which is very unlikely in the forseeable future because of the money invested, we also "only" have a problem until the next difficulty adjustment.
People own money, I still don't even know where you want to go with that argument.
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:59:31
You seem to have no understanding of what would make a crypto centralized and if this is your only argument \( which you cannot prove and I cannot disprove because you can't know \) it's a weak one because that has no effect on anything other then price. The least interesting part of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:05:01
Trying to explain why theres lower risk:
It takes time to generate profit and it may even become unprofitable from time to time. Selling the mining equipment has a instant and calculatable profit at the time of item\-sell and takes only the time to manufacture the ASIC.

IF this is not a troll, asking because the answer seems to long for a troll, do you care to explain?

Love it. Who made this?
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:01:43
Why not subscribe to the mailing lists of lightning and bitcoin for that? Or read bitcointalk? Sadly Reddit hasn't really been a place for that for a while now.
@_date: 2018-05-09 17:00:56
It's just so exciting to see something you truely believe in succeed and having that confirmed by having a physical item in your hand, throwback to buying my first lunch with bitcoin.

Obviously unpopular opinion but bitcoin is more then speculation for me. I've been here long enough so that I can openly and honestly say that I dont treat it as an asset. Call me borderline fanatic but I am here because I fucking believe in what bitcoin should and will be. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:09:36
"worth it"? Setting up a channel at the moment costs nearly nothing, let me tell you taking two minutes out of your day to set up a channel and experience lightning first hand is worth it. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 11:28:24
I mean you can buy via Bitcoin on G2A if I'm not mistaken, those cards are more expensive then in retail though just as everywhere else on the internet. If you want to use lightning your best bet would probably be finding someone who wants to trade personally with you in a forum or something since I'm not aware of a site selling [Battle.net]( Balance via Lightning \( Steam and others are available but not [B.net]( \).

Glad someone mentions it. Smaller blocksize limit? Sorry no. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 17:05:14
What's "real money" anyway? Money only has value because you and the baker down the road agree that it has, does that make it real though?

Currencies are the medium of exchange within a payment solution, not the payment solution.
@_date: 2019-03-26 21:14:04
You just said it yourself, payment solution - not currency.
@_date: 2019-03-27 05:41:54
Btcpay, Paypal and apple pay are payment solutions - bitcoin and usd are currencies. 
Currencies exist without payment solutions, payment solutions do not exist without currencies. Payment solutions can support multiple currencies though.
