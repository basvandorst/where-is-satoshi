Anything that falls 50% is a bubble, in conventional terms. BTC is anything but conventional. as an old timer, i see this as good thing, to build support on the charts. Had we gone from $7-8k to $25k, the correction would have been uglier. 
The Ace card has always been patience.
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:44:11
Yes, but what guarantees do we have that the real market cap is $2bn? They could easily have an unchecked, unaudited amount of Tether circulating, which buys up BTC sell orders. The whole thing stinks and we have every right to be worried about a token that is printable at will, and is recognized/accepted to purchase valuable BTC!

Brilliant 
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:26:24
Amazing how much progress could be made in a month. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:20:00
I would back this idea. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:30:47
This is Bit-con-nect dumping all the BTC that they have been collecting?
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:49:45
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:55:43
It is true that the duration of a correction is getting smaller and smaller. Could this really be mass adoption? Or institutional manipulation? That is the m(b)illion dollar question i guess.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:35:58
As i mentioned below...

@_date: 2017-12-07 14:31:21
True, but not in every case... most are in cold wallets, offline. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:57:25
Gone for ever, frozen in the current circulating supply, thus reducing supply, thus increasing price. When Fiat is lost, more is printed, creating further inflation. The complete opposite is true for BTC.

This Sub needs a sticky up top that states: "YOU CAN BUY $10 WORTH OF BTC - Here is how"
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:53:50
I just want to see what people with more experience than I have to say about institutional money, the coming of BTC futures, and on a positive side, mass adoption theory... 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:36:42
So sorry regarding the pets :'(
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:51:44
We need more retailers/services that accept Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:51:19
Seriously 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:34:00
That would be a 60% correction from ATH, doubtful imho. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:55:10
If my memory serves me right, didn't Roger Ver claim that he owned a percentage of blockchain.info? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:47:20
What crash? You mean the 6th 30%+ dip this year?
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:44:23
Ok, "$100 Worth of Bitcoin", as many have pointed out the fee situation. 
That's still 0.00588 BTC at today's price, which was the point of this post. 
Sorry if i hurt some feelings with the $10.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:48:28
The moment he starts mocking the interviewers income/ financial situation, i realized what a sociopath this guy is. Definitely not trust worthy, and the reply regarding BTC not being a business was spot on.
Bcash is not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:48:35
I hear you loud and clear and you just pretty much echoed my thoughts perfectly. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:10:52
rough estimate is in the neighborhood of 25% of coins are lost for ever. That's over 4 million coins unaccounted for.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:34:21
Good point. Perhaps this pump is institutional money... then when futures are active, the very same institutes that pumped so hard, would have put options - then sell BTC right before the options are expired?? I could be totally wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-02 06:37:24
Ahh Roger boy, the epitome of a sociopath... 
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:12:13
options anyone? 
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:01:45
So in a nutshell, the difficulty will keep rising, along with the price of BTC, thus miners will need much longer to get a coin, but it will be worth it as the price has risen so much? correct? 
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:28:15
That would be correct. When u need ur crypto, u need ur crypto. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:54:10
Sorted! A friend knew someone who knew someone, 5 quid solved it... happy times : )  
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:31:27
I would do tha in a heart beat of i could pick it up with some cash. Im in Jordan at the moment with no access to a credit card. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:25:09
I had 20 USD in BTC yesterday, sent out USD no noticing that i went below 0.01 BTC. Now im stuck and i dont have anyone close by that uses crypto...
Sad times indeed. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:26:12
non of my mates or family use crypto. Im in the middle east at the moment and no one around me cares (YET!)! 
@_date: 2019-03-11 16:27:37
That’s not what I’m looking to do. Was hoping the community would give out some suggestions or possible warnings that I haven’t thought of. 
@_date: 2019-03-11 18:24:27
Definitely not. I can easily sell what I get hold of on places like eBay. But for crypto, one can charge a small premium, and that’s where the added value comes in. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:52:56
Will this make the network become more centralised as less miners will find the idea of fees less attractive…?

Great story, if it were true.
Put them in a hard-wallet, then post the address if you would like your story to be believed. The cynic in me says, this is just some clever Hodl marketing.
Ps. I'm a hodler.

Class... I should have made/bought a rocket costume, then stuck BTC logos all over it. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:27:51
I am thinking of switching my mining to slush pool. Any advice? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:50:36
Been here since this time last year $699
I have to agree with the massive FUD this time. definitely coordinated, but they shall fail, like all the rest before them. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:49:00
Very awesome. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:01:52
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:00:08
Nope. sent BTC from exchange to trezor and paid the expensive exchange fee of 0.00100000 BTC, which is far less than $12. Got them in no time.  
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:02:22
If you can afford a decent hard wallet, you are already late. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:01:09

hah! I see what u did there! :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:02:23
May it be Bcash the imposter?

Actually if you watch the intro, a bunch of coins are flying through the air next to the crane... The Lite coin just happened to show when the person paused the clip for the screenshot. Need this in 4k to see all the other coins.

Are you trying to say the are veering off?
@_date: 2018-02-19 08:26:21
Yes. How else are they going to learn? $10 is not going to hurt anyone either. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:39:48
mmmm. the tech may be outdated before next winter, no thanks. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:04:54
Not true. One can buy BTC OTC and have it sent to a wallet using LN. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:30:02
Bollocks to your thoughts.
