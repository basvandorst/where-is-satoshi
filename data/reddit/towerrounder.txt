This is not how exchanges work, unless you meant something else.
When you make a trade in an exchange, it's off chain always. At this point, your balance is actually just a number in a database table 
When you send that balance to your own wallet, that's on chain always. This is your real bitcoin.

I'm actually willing to bet that a good acid test on a shitcoin is to look at its Blockchain volume instead of its coinmarketcap volume. 
Anecdotally, when a new coin is released on exchange, there's a movement on chain. And then prices drop because the movement on chain becomes less.
Gonna actually check it out

Asshole yes, but that point 2 hit me in the feels man. Feel the same way about it.

OP kinda wrong here, if you read it properly that OP refers to an ever increasing BTC price.
Dumb bullshit anyway

Slightly misleading, but anyway

It's far more important for the middle class to do this than upper class guys.
Reason is that these guys can take the risk because they're probably in a good financial position. 
This who are not shouldn't take their salary as 100% btc just yet.
