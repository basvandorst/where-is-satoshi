True but as I mentioned any new accounts/addresses are used once (with fake info behind a VPN or TOR) and deleted as soon as their transaction to another wallet or cold storage is done after mixing the coins a couple times using the service the other user mentioned. As for people I am trading with or selling to is a different story I suppose. But in that case as long as my trail to my other addresses are otherwise nonexistent or very hard to track and using a completely unrelated wallet/cold storage for trading and selling, I don't see where my privacy would be removed. I might be missing something so I'd be glad to hear your thoughts.

I guess you're right. I just shouldn't mess up. It shouldn't be that hard if I'm careful enough and I shouldn't be doing it too often anyway. Step by step.

True true. Thanks for the info! It's been really helpful.

True. My point of privacy though is not to send it to anyone in particular but to make it anonymous outside of my account so I can withdraw it somehow (prepaid card or gift card), trade it, or keep it stored in cold storage. Although wouldn't it work to send it to a friend's account after using all the privacy stuff? Like my Coinbase I buy 1 BTC, send it to a couple different addresses in smaller transactions, send it from there to a single address, delete old addresses, send coins to mixer (the one you mentioned), send them to another separate address, and then send them to my friend in a few different addresses, and then have him send them to his Coinbase Account (or any other wallet he uses for that matter)? Won't the trail be pretty much gone by that point?

Makes a lot of sense. So if I do as much as I can when moving coins they can be much harder to track. How secure does my hypothetical situation in my last comment sound? Of course counting out the most dedicated people does it sound secure enough for most situations at least? As long as those addresses (with fake emails linked and names if possible and made behind a VPN) are deleted after use would that also help make it more private and secure since it would be harder to track especially after mixing?

I heard about that. Sounds pretty secure. Have you used it yourself?
@_date: 2015-11-09 07:43:30
How does it work exactly? And how was your experience using it?
@_date: 2015-11-09 20:09:46
Cool thanks. I'll look into it.

Okay. Is it fine to use Coinbase for buying though? And then doing as I said by moving it out of the account as discreetly as possible? And if I send to them is it okay for them to sell the coins on Coinbase into their bank (for ones that might not mind the privacy concerns as much as myself) as long as my trail to them is pretty much nonexistent?
