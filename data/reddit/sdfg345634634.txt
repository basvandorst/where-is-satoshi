Call the bank, tell them that they mistakenly declined some recent transactions that you made and you want them to be whitelisted. Go back to coin.mx, retry the buy.. this is pretty much standard procedure for using a credit card on any non-amazon or other mega brand website.

I guess it's similar to liqpay and liberty reserve.. basically you just have an unrecognized 'central bank' run by the company that issues vouchers backed by cash that they hold somewhere (or not!) and leave the retailing of the vouchers to shady middlemen who will regularly get shut down and have their accounts closed.. but their job is to open new acccounts and new front companies to keep things going.. also because the regulators know this they're possibly less inclined to even bother shutting them down.

If the deposit failed it's most likely because it was declined  by your bank. Call your bank and ask if their fraud system mistakenly declined any transactions recently. They should be able to whitelist it.. then go back to circle and retry the deposit. most likely it will work.. but with the cash fee, card fx rates for usd/gbp conversion and circle's own 2.9% card fee don't be surprised if it ends up costing around 8%.. it is very convenient and instant but you can actually get cheaper BTC on localbitcoins if you find a good seller.

Sadly bitcoin is not an option for this guy.. the service he was using is much cheaper than anything you could do with bitcoin.
