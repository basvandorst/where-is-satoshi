Why not list it on eBay, choose "cash on pickup"  as a payment option, but also write in the listing that you will accept bitcoin/crypto for postal orders?
That way if anyone wants it posted out they will need to use a crypto.

I think it is quite probable that it is one of two people creating lots of accounts. These accounts seem to exist solely to post negative comments about bitcoin, and a lot of them are new accounts. They are all there at the same time, swarming onto a thread and voting each other up. Sometimes they even pretend to have minor disagreements about exactly *how much* of a ponzi scheme bitcoin is, which is a nice touch. 
They are so over the top it is ridiculous. So much so that I could almost believe they are actually trying to *discredit* other bitcoin critics. I mean, some of the accounts have names like "tulipfutures" and "Btcpyramid". They are like parody accounts. 
They are so very obvious that I don't think they are convincing anyone of anything. It's just kind of annoying, between them and the "freeeee" accounts, there is just a lot of rubbish to wade through here. 
I'm worried that when potentially negative things actually do happen in the bitcoin world, people will dismiss them because of they are all worn out by the constant negative trolling. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 05:27:08
After all the retarded drama recently, yeah, things are pretty boring right now. But i don't think this can really be taken to mean anything. 
I remember everyone at my workplace talking about bitcoin when it first went up to $250. 
A couple of weeks later they were all bored of it. 
When it went up again, everyone was talking about it again, and a few of them bought some. 
People hysterically buying in when it's going up, and those who spend their time posting *hundreds* of negative comments every time the price goes down - these groups are very alike, in that neither of them add anything of value to what I think is a pretty cool community and technology.

Don't sell your MTG cards for BTC! 
Hold, in a few years they will be worth way more. 
Or, rather than cashing out, try to find a merchant that accepts MTG directly. Encourage them to pay their suppliers in MTG where possible.

My understanding is that credit cards are checked through the payment system at the time of sale, regardless of whether a signature is taken. The system checks if they have enough funds or whether they have been blacklisted. 
If unauthorised transactions happen on a credit card, that card will eventually be disabled. 
There is not yet any analogue for this in the bitcoin system. It's more like cheque cashing.

In Australia, any time a sale is made with regular old money, ten percent of the sale price must go to the government as tax. 
When it came out, it was strange and scary. And then everyone got used to it. 
There is no reason that bitcoin transactions would/should be exempt from GST. If they were, then using bitcoin would be the most awesome way to avoid tax, ever. 
Is GST really payable when purchasing coins from an exchange? That doesn't make sense.

@_date: 2014-03-25 21:46:04
Correct me if I'm wrong... but the only information you need to do your tax is some way to tag which bitcoin transactions were buys and which were sells/purchases, right? 
If you have a list of your wallet addresses, then come tax time, you could scan over all transactions in the blockchain for the last year, get the historical exchange rates, and calculate approximately how much you bitcoin you have sold, and for how much. 
If I'm missing something please let me know =)

For the purpose of this thread I'm using ATM to mean transfer either way. I don't think the definition needs to be limited to two way transfers since normal bank ATMs don't even have this ability.

Perhaps online businesses just generally get less media attention than brick and mortar businesses. 
I could imagine that journalists find physical stores much more tangible and easier to report on. 
The need to show *something* is obviously quite strong as shown by the pictures of "physical" bitcoin on every article. 
Perhaps pictures hold more credibility because they have traditionally been harder to manipulate than words.

Just a quick note about how this works.
For each round, the top right shows the prize for that round. The prize seems to change between rounds, between 0.001 BTC and 0.004 BTC. It is not clear when/why it changes, except that apparently every hour, on the dot, there is a round at 0.004 BTC.
It costs .001 BTC to make a guess. This coin is not returned to you, whether you win or lose.
If you win, 20% of the prize pool is taken by the house, and the rest is immediately sent to you.
If the prize is at 0.001, and you make a correct guess, you will lose money (20%) and be returned 0.0008. This particular aspect does not seem to make any sense.

I can vouch for coinjar being easy to use and safe in my experience so far. 
Only complaints I've heard are for verifications, seems you need to contact them to get them to chase it up quickly. 
One thing to note is it is not an exchange, so you are paying a premium. 
First of all there's a 2 percent fee to buy. 
Then there is their buy/sell spread which is a lot higher than the bid/ask spread on most exchanges. 
You also need to understand that their fair price formula, which calculates their spot price, can change with time.

I've listed with bitcoin payment in the description before - I just picked both PayPal and COD as payment methods. 
If you chose only PayPal, and then tried to get people to use bitcoin, that could be a problem.
There is no difference between COD, bitcoin, or bank transfer when it comes to eBay's ability to verify payments. I would like to hear more about what happened to you here, as if they have singled out bitcoin as being disallowed that is unacceptable.

Yep. To anyone that thinks volatility is going to kill bitcoin -  the AUD/USD pair has seen some crazy shit in the last decade. 
How are prices for US brands so stable in Australia? The volatility has traditionally been handled by Australians paying insane prices for US goods, all the time. 
When the buying power of the Australian dollar goes up, things STILL cost like twice as much to buy in Australia as they do if you bought them on holiday in the states. 
That is the cost we are paying for reducing volatility...

Hmm, I see what you mean. But I guess it is how you look at it.
I've bought some bitcoin to keep, and some as spending money - i.e. it was purchased specifically to be spent. I don't consider this portion as an investment in bitcoin, because I plan to spend it on a pretty short timeframe.
If bitcoin goes up in value, then I won't specifically regret making those purchases using bitcoin. I will just regret that I didn't buy more as an investment. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 09:04:00
I am Australian and I can verify this is true. However I didn't know about this until a couple of months ago, because it is not something that most people will come across in their day to day lives. When I first heard about I also thought it was unbelievable. 
I think the idea is something like, if someone has disappeared/died, rather than the banks being the default recipient of the funds, the government is. Which I think makes sense.

Once these trolls shut up, do you think a lot of people will start commenting with the "BTC is the best!" stance again, with their arguments having a similar lack of depth? Because it's kind of quiet on that front right now. 
Perhaps this is the same group of people. I don't know if a campaign like this could have an appreciable effect on price,. But if so, it would be a very clever strategy for someone trading in BTC to engage with a group offering to spam the forums with alternatively negative and positive sentiment.

I don't think it matters what the early distribution of bitcoin is. What matters is how it evolves over time. 
One person who has hoarded 1 percent of all bitcoin has a lot of power now. But the power is only there while they have those coins, and (apart from being able to scare people into doing something stupid), the power can only be exercised by actually using that bitcoin. 
I believe that early adopters *will* eventually burn through all their coins, either exchanging for goods and services, or selling them. 
Will bitcoin wealth concentration produce a feedback effect like it does in fiat economies (i.e. The rich get richer?). I don't know. I'd assume yes, it will be the same thing, but it would be interesting if there were any theories to the contrary. My assumption is that the crypto geeks who got in early will eventually be displaced and wealth distribution will end up something like it is now (i.e. The type of people that are rich now will become rich in the bitcoin economy). 
Also, to anyone who things our culture of massive consumption is a good thing, let's have a chat about that on the evacuation shuttle after we finish fucking the planet.

I agree. Nothing is going to happen on the fifteenth. We already and announcements about bank transfers stopping on various dates. Who knows, the price may crash or sky rocket due to other news in a weeks time, but there is CURRENTLY NO REASON TO THINK ANYRHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN SPECIFICALLY ON THE FIFTEENTH. 
There's been a lot of talk about waiting till the fifteenth to get back in. If a lot of people are planning to do this the price will spike on the fifteenth. Smart people would get in early. There's been a lot of buys this weekend huh? And it's being led from China.

Whatever gets used, it needs to be something in Unicode. Using vector graphics everywhere or creating a new font (?) is not going to work. 
I am not fully convinced either way, but I will comment that the new symbol is still not supported on the default android font, which is a big problem.

This is so dumb. 
Using this argument, the act of transferring gold could also be considered very expensive, since gold is continually mined. Or, if you pay cash, you need to consider how much additional money has been printed, and factor *that* in to your transaction costs. At least bitcoin and gold have a capped supply, whereas paper money does not. 
But in any case, the reason people do not think this way for gold, fiat, or bitcoin, is because it is just not a useful way of modelling transaction costs. It is not insightful or clever at all. 
Inflation itself is an important concept. But this makes no sense.

I was joking. I didn't believe you. If you wanted to check if your wallet can receive coin, you could have asked for one satoshi. 
If you legitimately need to check, you could use this service to get some free BTC and send it to yourself: 
Also, if you have an offline armory install, it is not going to show the money, because it is offline.

If you are talking about the commonwealth bank, I heard that Coinjar have had no end of trouble with them, and are a lot happier with NAB.

I recently tried Coinbase and I found the denomination in BTC very confusing.
Aside from the BTC/mBTC thing, does anyone else find it strange that no-one ever uses any sort of periodic separator after a decimal point?

Even thought the link OP posted says that it costs $52 or so go get a $50 steam card, and this put me off a bit, it is actually cheaper than steamloader ( 
If you pick pay with bitcoin, and enter your email, they will send you a quote. I just got quoted 0.0906129 BTC for a $50 steam voucher on OPs site. 
Steam loader is 92mBTC for the same $50 voucher.

I bought a book from Polyester Books in Melbourne. 
I read online that they accepted bitcoin and wanted to give it a try. The staff said that bitcoin sales were small but slowly increasing. I think there was a bit of excitement from all of us just to be using bitcoin. 
The experience for me was very positive. It was super super quick, they typed an amount, a 2D Barcode popped up, I scanned it on my phone and typed the amount, and pressed send. A big green tick flashed on their screen within a second. I got a reciept. Done. 
The price was very close to the current bitcoin average exchange rate multiplied by the AUD price, which was quoted with GST included. 
I don't really see any downsides for bitcoin in this setting - at least not yet. Zero confirmation transactions are obviously not an issue for them at this point in time.
@_date: 2014-06-19 22:27:06

This is an interesting question, but it is not specific to bitcoin. 
Why would I sell my house, when it will continue to appreciate in value in the long term? Why withdraw money for spending when I'm getting a good interest rate? Why would I buy a sports car now when I have a mortgage? 
The reason is that one day we will die.

Unlimited really means "unquantifed". Lower bounds on leave are thrown out along with the upper, and corporate culture determines what you will be able to take. 
Without anything accruing on paper, you will find it much harder and feel much more guilty asking for time off. That's the basic gist of it. 
A tech company I worked for did this in the US, but weren't allowed to do it in Australia because of stronger worker protection.

The thing I love the most is being able to buy digital content without having to create an account, hand over personal info, remember login details, and deal with having a credit card. 
For digital goods, I use bitcoin where I can because 1) it is quicker/easier, and 2) I want to help encourage other marketplaces for digital goods to do the same. 
To me this is THE use case for bitcoin, and it does it exceedingly well - everything else is a bonus.
