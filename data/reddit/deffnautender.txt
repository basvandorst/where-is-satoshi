as 10 dollars or 10 total withdraws? Like lets say I make 100 bucks a day, would I be safe withdrawing monthly? Which site is reputable?

I'm actually pretty close to done and have already written all the websockets and stuff... but what are you talking about strategy module? This is something much simpler.

I haven't paid for anything yet. I'm looking to get in, thus research.

So gox doesn't let you withdraw? How is the most reputable place? I was just about to buy my first btc from gox.

see i keep hearing this but I wanna play the luck factor. I have two pcs sitting doing nothing all day anyway. Why not gamble with the electricity they are already using?

obviously, the math isn't easy or I wouldn't have extended this offer. Do you know what a cliche is? It's something that's done so much it's considered faux-paus.... like attacking someone because he's a programming champ with that "ur an x, y don't you do y" logic. 
so please keep your snide, jealous, behavior to yourself. To anyone with a lot of logic it shows a glimpse of your character and, in me at least, has created disdain.
