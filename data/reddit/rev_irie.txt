No, **I** am Spartacus!

Yup. Let's call them out on this two-faced bullshit.

In other news, bitcoin is up 250% in the last 30 days.

If you really wanted to prove you don't give a shit, you'd have called it Operation Honey Badger

This is a bit surprising, but also awesome.

The problem is that a lot of exchanges hide the fee, rather than making it apparent, so people can choose to tip the miners and whatnot. I know that Virtex usually just pays the fee for you, but it'd be nice if there was a bigger push in the community to make the fee a bigger deal. Hopefully as transaction volumes increase it'll get to be a bigger deal.

The "fixed" version made me laugh more than the original.

He said "trusted", not "random". It's a good idea. I'd chip in.

Not spam. Relax. We're mostly capitalists here. It's spam if you keep posting it over and over and over again. You haven't.
Incidentally, I'm a very kinky Bitcoin user, but the GF and I just tend to use inexpensive ropes for binding.

Not presently. Virtex has a 3% fee on exchanges, which works out to $1.50 at the current ~$50/BTC valuation, so $51.5 or less. Canadianbitcoins is $53.62 which is like 7%.
On their graphs it looks like they use Mt. Gox as a reference point, which is lower than Virtex right now, so Canadianbitcoins is even more pricy.
