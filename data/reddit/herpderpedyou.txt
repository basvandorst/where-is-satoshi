you went all in on crypto, so you accepted to lose everything.
now you lost everything, due to your second mistake: being an idiot and creating that wallet on a PC you are using on a regular basis.

sorry, a bit late, but let me try to explain what i meant:

you can have a lot of space, just don't live in a bigger city?
not expensive at all in a lot of countries
I have never felt "close" to all the problems you have listed, this is pure bullshit.

your calculation doesnt include any news, any hype, new technologys or anouncements. nothing. so it obviously cant be right
