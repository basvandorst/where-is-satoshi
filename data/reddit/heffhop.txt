Yikes. I’m a little too risk averse for that

Liked it!

I did just about the same, except marginally increased my BTC about .1% lol. It’s a really freaky feeling when you sell, and are sitting there waiting to time a bottom. It’s nerve-wracking and thrilling at the same time.

Other than philosophical reasons and the ability to host your own wallet, are there any perks to hosting a node? 
I have been considering hosting One as well.

Like take a loan against your bitcoin to buy more bitcoin?

If you want to invest in BTC using TA I think you are setting yourself up for failure, as a thought experiment look at the chart for the last year and tell me how you would have traded it. In my opinion TA is akin to voodoo and right just as often as it is wrong. Would your voodoo really have gained you more than just holding bitcoin for the last year?
You do sound like a logical investor though. All the logical investors I know, invest with goals based on their risk tolerance. Diversity is one way investors can lower their risk, along with evaluating the risk of any investment. Bitcoin is going to be different for different people. From only an investment perspective I would label it high risk. However, putting money you can afford to lose into it, I think actually lowers your overall risk, because it will add diversity to your asset portfolio. 
As with any investment, due your own due diligence.
Now to answer your question, I don’t think either way about bitcoin being a bubble. I see a future for bitcoin and I see possibilities of it crashing. As for my asset portfolio, it is mandatory based on my personal situation that it is included. I intend to hold some bitcoin long term to pass down to my kids/grand kids. Now if it starts crashing I’ll definitely try to minimize my losses, but I think it foolish to not accept some volatility and ride it out. It’s too much effort for me to try to time markets, and anytime I’ve tried to in the past, generally if I just held I’d have always been better off.

As I recommend to anyone, invest only as much as you can afford to lose. If it crashes I’ll try to minimize my losses and/or buy more. However I could easily walk away today with all of my original investment and still hold btc, but like I said before I intend to pass some down many years in the future.

Yes people make money off of TA, YMMV of course, but whenever I hear people actually reporting their TA before a market move, in my experience it’s only correct half of the time.
Here is a good paper to read from the investment world [Ark invest: bitcoin]( . Obviously, you can get the exact opposite view from others in the investment community like ceo of jpmorgan chase.
And it was called a bubble when it was $1000 per btc. This is nothing new. Bitcoin is not only reaching new $ highs its more importantly reaching more usership highs.
