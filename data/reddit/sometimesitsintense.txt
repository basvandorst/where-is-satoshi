Reading this I had to check the letter twice to make sure it was a K and not an M. Honestly, with the type of intellectual property being discussed here, I think M is more fair to everyone.

obviously the most likely alt to win would be a fork of bitcoin itself (at the current block whenever they fork) with larger blocks.

Would you pay a dollar one time to support youtube monitizing its uploaders? If so, you could transit that dollar towards them not showing you ads. 
Adblock is like torrenting youtube videos, it ends up stealing from the people you watch.

What I say in real life:
Me: "Hey man, want a dollar?"
Them: "No" or "whats the catch?"
Me: "Its in bitcoin, what kind of phone do you have? If you get a bitcoin wallet app I'll give you a dollars worth of bitcoin right now"
Them: "is the app free?"
Me: "yes"
Then they either take it or they don't. I have gotten dozens of people with this, no clue if any of them went on to use bitcoin, but I know that at least a few more people can really appreciate how fast and easy it is to get money in BTC.

Or they could be implying that they are bears on the stockmarket, and that they are genuinely trying to get more people into bitcoin, but aren't actually selling their own. 
Either way, good to see more casual exposure.

I stopped using it a week ago, I switched to deluge. Some of the torrents I had on uTorrent were going 3 kb/s I put them on deluge and they went to 3.5 mb/s I can't even explain it, but fuck uTorrent.
They were cool about 2-3 years ago before they added ads and fucked up the UI beyond reason.

I really wish there was a way to exclude the people bitcoin was created to bypass, but I accept the fact that that goes against the basis for bitcoin's success. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 12:40:05
Not only that, it effectively throttles you in at least two ways.
1. Whatever blockchain they connect to will be sending data, and they will be sending hashes. This takes bandwidth.
2. If your CPU is proccesing a bunch of hash-generation, it will be slower writing to your disk, possibly even stopping it if you had set your torrent software to be very high priority.

I plan on leaving an asymptotically decreasing trust fund for all future progeny, ensuring a life where food and warmth are always available.    
Also once bitcoin catches on in my lifetime, I'm going to get a very secure mobile wallet, carry enough for immediate needs, and a plane ticket from anywhere in the world to a tiny house I will buy in a place without property tax. I'll fill it with cans of beans, tuna and water, then I'll never go there.
I want to walk the earth as an ascetic, learning every language and helping people I meet along the way.

In the same way Bank of America is worth $243 billion, and people say bitcoin is overvalued at a $5 billion market cap.

"Several countries, on the continent such as Seychelles..."
Had to stop reading for a moment to roll my eyes. Seychelles is a group of islands, and they chose to start the list of continental countries with it. I wouldn't have minded if it was third or fourth on the list.
Other than that, pretty decent article.

I've never heard of that, but there is a complex glitch in the language bitcoin is programmed in, after all the blocks to get to 21 mil, the algorithm is undefined. In 125 years, I'm sure it will have been assessed as not a problem, or have been fixed, but as it currently stands its not clear exactly what the first block after 21 mil coins will do.  
Edit:
