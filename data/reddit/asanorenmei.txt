Roughly 0.25% from most the exchanges I've looked at.

Impossible to say. If I had to guess, I think it's going to stabilize things and reduce volatility. The big money will finally produce a downward pressure on the price. Institutions trading on the CME aren't HODLers. Thus, I think it'll cause the march towards 100k to go slower as a result. Of course, I could be 100% wrong. Time will tell.

Watching that in real-time on GDAX was pretty cool. It sat frozen at 13999.99 for a good 5-10 seconds. You could see a bunch of big blocks waiting to sell at 14k. Then all of the sudden it was spiking between 14k and 14250. Nuts!

Gemini seems to trade slightly lower than Coinbase/GDAX from what I've seen.

Performing the actual transaction is easy, sure. But finding a random individual that has, and is looking to unload, 100k worth of BTC is a bit more difficult. And that's the part that the exchanges make easy -- it's why we pay them a transaction fee.

Ditto. Wish I could buy LTC on gemini though.

Not quite accurate. For every buy, there is an equal and opposite sell. What drives the price one way or the other is how much it's being bought/sold for relative to the current price.
For example, assume the current going price is $100. Bob advertises that he's will to sell his 1 BTC for $110. Sally decides to buy it at that price. Thus, the prices rises to $110.
On the other hand, maybe Sally (or anybody else) doesn't want to buy at $110. She only wants to pay $90. When Alex comes along and sells his 1BTC to Sally for $90, the current price drops to $90.
That's a very simplified example, of course, but it illustrates that price isn't dictated by more buyers than sellers (the number of buyers and sellers is always equal). Instead, it's dictated by the price people are willing to buy and sell at.

If he's really holding it long term, like he said, I assume (hope?) he moved everything off the exchange and onto cold storage.

I did look at Bitfinex, but they no longer allow trading from individual US customers, as far as I understand it.

Which exchange did you buy from, and how long did it take you to get 100k (USD?) into play? I'm looking at similar sized investments, but the monthly limits of coinbase/gemini/etc are really low.
