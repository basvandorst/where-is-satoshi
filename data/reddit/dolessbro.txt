How do you define "the worst"? Fox News leans right, MSNBC arguably leans even more left. But they aren't shy about that or claim not to lean (keyword) one way. I'd argue CNN is worse because they claim to be bias free but display blatant bias to the point of it being infuriating. It's as if they think we're morons who can be manipulated by anything. There is a cable news channel called OAN (One America News) which does a really nice job IMO. Very few opinions offered, just the stories and the facts and they let the viewers draw their own conclusions

Mainstream journalism* is dead. The bigger the portion of the population that sees through their agenda and tunes them out, the more aggressive they have to be with their agenda to retain their current viewer base. At this point they're bordering on propaganda. We've seen ratings and subscribers for the major media outlets have been dropping considerably. There are unbiased news outlets out there and many new ones popping up

Did you steal this from me? I posted this on here months ago. Trump is favor of anything that advances US interests and wealth. Declaring bitcoin legitimate after hoarding it would certainly do that 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:10:52
Bitcoin is king..it's the one everyone knows and thus the one everyone who's not in is most likely to invest in. If BTC fails, it would be very hard for another to take it's place unless over a very long period of time. BTC is still in it's very early stages...I recommend investing fully in BTC if you're ready to invest in crypto

Question: is there a way to set an automatic sell on Coinbase? If not, where is the best place to do so
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:18:18
You simply cant compare Bitcoin to the US Stock Market as I see some trying to do. The US Stock Market has a much smaller purchasing market and a much smarter purchasing market. If we could make that comparison, we would have already dipped back to $7500. But because we have so many more avenues of growth than most stocks and people to fuel that growth, we miracously held and will likely continue to grow in coming months.

Trump is good for Bitcoin imo. If he sees the opportunity he has to further advance America's wealth and prosperity with it, we can easily see a $500K BTC eventually

If you only look at his cool strut and golly gee smile, Obama was a great President. If you look at the grand scheme of things, he was a pretty bad President. Is there honestly any doubt his shortcomings contributed to Trump's victory?
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:05:44
Our national debt doubled under Obama. I couldn't fathom voting for a continuation of that. I am a former Obama voter who voted for Trump. Our govt has spiraled out of control. He's the right man at the right time IMHO. Time will tell but my retirement portfolio is up 11% compared to 3% last year so I'm pretty happy thus far

Yes obviously but I'm talking about long term growth potential. The US Stock Market is the best in the world, as it should be. Americans invest in it. But crypto is taking in money from all over the world, very different markets of investors, traders and buyers

This reminds me of the time I bet $5000 on an absolute 100% lock. It was paying -1000 meaning I would only win $500, but it was such certainy I viewed it as a free $500 which I had plans to spend in a very foolish way after the game. Well a freak injury happened and I ended up losing $5000 that took me a full month of incessant anger to get over. And I'll forever be down 5 g's lol. Nothings guaranteed my friend. I respect it but hope you'll be fine in the off-chance the worst happens

Did people honestly not see this coming? I have a good Turkish friend so I've been abreast of what's been happening there for awhile but I guess I assumed it's been common knowledge. Islam has been aggressively hijacking Turkey for years and the most recent leader was the nail in the coffin....but he wasn't elected yesterday or anything. Christians and Non-Muslims have been getting out of Turkey any way they can. That is not a recipe for financial success, especially for a country who relies a lot on tourism (an industry which has completely plummeted)
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:45:52
Whether Turkey buys Apple or Samsung has no impact on their economy and no impact on ours. Apple just release numbers confirming they’re the most successful company in human history. It just demonstrates the wildly misguided groupthink (circa Islam) that has engulfed the country that leads to societal and economic depression. Very sad. I’d love to get to Turkey one day but that desire is dwindling

Donald Trump could become our hero over the next 3-7 years. He has to represent banks and politics...he's President of the USA. But he's also all about doing everything that will improve America's wealth, global footing and power. I'm 100% sure he's already had a group of top level economists brief him on the in's and out's of Bitcoin as he's very in touch with current events. If/when he realizes that the US government can start hoarding Bitcoin in an effort to simultaneously further legitimize the currency and make America richer, he will do so. The last thing he wants is America missing the boat on this and losing wealth and power. That's a win for all of us and there's speculation these recent sharp gains could be coming from that direction. With economic deals he keeps his cards very close to his chest so don't expect him to comment on it anytime soon. The less he does, the more likely it is true America is quietly supportive

@_date: 2017-11-30 18:30:23
It's very simple. Ethereum is a weak shadow of BTC. I've been saying that on here for a year and have been scoffed at countless times. For Ethereum to ever be a major success and thus mainstream, BTC will already have to be a mainstream success. No one will have confidence in ethereum/crypto if bitcoin fails. Ethereums  present and future is almost 100% dependent on how Bitcoin does. That's why I've also said every dollar put into crypto should be going into BTC right now at this early stage and that remains true for the next 2 years
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:32:23
No one wants to live in a borderless world. That might sound cool and progressive to you but in reality it will be a disaster where a lot of people are pretending to be happy and they're not. We are all different people with different views and different cultures. We can be nice and kind to each other without forcing each other to sacrifice aspects of our beliefs and cultures to accomodate others. We're already connected enough as is. Seperations were put in place for good reasons and are in place today for good reasons

The longer any major drop takes to materialize, the smaller that major drop will be. I'd argue we saw the big drop from over 11 to into the 8's within an hour. and we've since fought back and held strong. I think we'll hold strong mid 9's and climb back up to 12 within 2 weeks

President Trump should invest in buying as much bitcoin as humanly possible. Then mandate it as the global standard. Anyone who doesn't like it gets blown to pieces. America overnight hoards 80% of the worlds wealth and our economy goes to Pluto. He amends "merit-based immigration" to include exceptions for women of exceptional beauty. Then I'll buy 50 Thai girls, 50 Colombian girls, 50 Brazilian girls and 50 Russian girls and move into a mansion in the Rocky Mountains and live out my days as the god I deserve to be. /s but not really.

He's about anything that furthers American interests. If he thinks bitcoin is the inevitable future and we have the ability and influence to set ourselves up for huge economic advantages down the road, I think he'd strongly consider putting great amounts of our reserves into BTC

Borders are a good thing. They limit the power of government officials and give the common man a larger voice. Anyone who is for a borderless world is living wildly in fantasy land. Borders are what's holding the world economy together and keeping more money in more common peoples pockets because they're more relevant in their respective "country". The irony of the socialist left is they want a borderless world because they say it will help the common man. All it will do is creative an even larger lower class who the mouthpieces who push that nonsense can rule over
The notion you believe all people are created equal shows me you live in a nonexistant utopia. Not a single person in the world is equal to you. We all have slight variances and differences. We all have the ability to be better or worse than each other based on the decisions we make, the lessons and values we learn from family, etc. but you need to get rid of this idea that everyone is equal. Becuase then people will just do nothing and get the same benefits as people who earn what they have
