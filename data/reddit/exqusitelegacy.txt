No, It’s something to do with Wall Street people I’ve heard. It’s huge!

I’m waiting for $10 worth of BTC to transfer to my Exodus. I had a couple dollars on Coinbase for whatever reason and it raised to $10 lol

Like I said, people literally ask similar questions on this subreddit all of the time for either some guidance, advice, or whatever it might be. If you can’t give out minor information to help him out instead of being negative, no matter what subreddit this is on as long as it is relevant, you don’t deserve the privilege of owning Bitcoin. We’re a community.

Hey guy, life is good! Try not to take things so seriously over the internet hahaha And if you must know I got 93, missed only 2 questions on the cyber test. What’d you get i’m curious!

I’ve been hearing a lot of people talking about “futures” what is that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:49:49
Ohhh okay, so this could be a really good thing?
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:02:36
Me too, what do you think so far?
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:26:33
Please buy a hardware wallet if you own a Bitcoin!! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:12:26
And we going back up!

I’ve been hearing a lot about the XLM coins, nothing technical but when I say a lot I mean A LOT. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:14:03
Whats that
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:31:15
Do you think it’ll dip??? or i buy in now??
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:21:41
Hahaha indeed!
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:55:51
Same bro same
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:43:39
Whats your prediction?
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:19:17
9k was only like a week ago or so right? Wow. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:31:54
I agree, I’m literally only 19 and what I have invested into Bitcoin comes out of my own pocket. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:30:02
So you’re new to this I see
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:21:38
Sounds about right, thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:05:16
Why that exact number? ��
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:43:05
Basically, a Dip is when the price of Bitcoin goes down momentarily. When I say that I see a “correction” occur after every new thousand that is achieved, it is mainly the cause of a lot of people selling off their Bitcoin decreasing the value and shortly after that happens a lot of people buy back into Bitcoin increasing the value to where or even more the value was prior to that “correction”. I typically see “corrections” last a few hours of the day, although it can last longer than that. It really just depends and you’re going to have to trust your gut. I know somebody else can explain this better than me, but I tried my best so hopefully you’ll get the point. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:05:07
It’s because we all want that dolla! I don’t blame him, that’s why we’re here to tell him what’s up.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:36:44
Without a doubt. Imagine all the Christmas money that all these people are going to get and invest into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:26:17
Ain’t nothing wrong with giving some advice from your own prospective. With that being said, I’ve noticed a trend after every new thousand mark that Bitcoin achieves, there is almost always a “dip” or what I prefer “correction”. So I plan to invest more into Bitcoin as well once I start notice the correction occurring after it achieves $12,000. I may be completely wrong but I see this correction every-time, just got to look out for it in time or you’ll miss it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:16:40
I’m on it right now I have no clue what you’re talking about
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:36:16
I’ve been waiting for a dip since $12,000 this is so anxious. With it going up so fast don’t you think there will be a huge correction or something?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:59:28
Look at this guy lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:49:46
Ughh... I hate BofA, I literally closed my account with them yesterday and went with USAA.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:02:35
I’m waiting for a correction as well.... I’ve been wanting to buy in more since 12,000 but as I continue to wait for a dip it keeps rising and it’s freaking me out!! lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:16:02
Oh man I’mma have to agree with you! We can only hope!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:39:20
Btw, theres a site I used to buy “Warcraft Gold” from for 20,000g for $25. I don’t know what the rules are for linking stuff like this but if you want it I’ll give you the link. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:46:19
Somebody correct me if I am wrong, but you keep the % of the Bitcoin that you originally invested.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:21
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:05:50
Yeah you’re right its kinda scary tbh
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:13:32
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:28:23
People like that are annoying as hell ignore him. I can honestly see the price increasing by a lot these next few weeks, especially once people start getting that christmas money. So I personality don’t think it would be a bad choice to buy in right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:11:26
In your opinion what do you think the result of this would be? I’m curious.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:34
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:13:50
You really took the time out of your day to look all the way down into my feeds I’m weak. I guess you can call me ignorant, but at least I won’t waste my time looking into your account because I simply dgaf. I’ve obviously hit some insecurities lmao!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:20:58
Not sure what he means either?
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:40:09
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:16:01
What the hell is that guy talking about? lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:56:54
I completely agree. As I was closing my account with them in person the teller even agreed with me that the new fees their trying to add-on are ridiculous. I upvoted, not sure why anybody would down vote this?? That’s annoying...
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:06:36
In my opinion I can guarantee that Bitcoin will surpass 20k, shoot by next year even triple that!
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:56:56
But he literally mentioned “Bitcoin” in that context. People ask stuff like that all the time on this subreddit you 40 year old virgin. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:33:13
I still launder money with Bitcoin so i’d say its not too traceable. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:33:55
Hey man nobody was supposed to notice ��
@_date: 2018-05-22 17:46:35
@_date: 2018-05-07 05:27:14
Well I know that will prevent you from signing up with any of the exchanges that I know of, but you should still be able to download wallets. I suggest maybe asking a family member or a close friend who would be willing to buy it for you. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 00:17:52
Let’s not start please...
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:19:25
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:53:20
I believe there will be a increase, but nothing dramatic. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:00:04
I’ve had the same thing happen to me using my phone until I made the transaction over my computer and it worked immediately.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:52:21
Same issue with me, I think it’s because I have no credit
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:31:53
You’re right, thank you for all the advice.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:28:48
Why not?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:48:25
i use exodus 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:00:28
Good idea, I just bought $300 worth of Bitcoin and look forward into purchasing more hopefully soon! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:59:47
Me too I’m interested.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:14:44
Something like this was happening to me with Coinbase, and I’m not sure whether or not Blockchain is a mobile app but as soon as I tried making a transaction on Coinbase from my computer it accepted it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:27:22
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:54:04
This made me laugh so much ����
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:11:20
Thats a good idea, and with the increase going on should I expect a short term drop and decide to invest then? or should I invest now. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:05:27
Well damn
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:35:53
Oh okay I wouldn’t know much about that then, sorry about that.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:00:42
Sounds about right, thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:43:07
wtf!!! i’m weak
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:29:28
I don’t see whats wrong with investing now with $266 unless you can’t afford to lose it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:58:57
I think you’re right! Thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:25:46
Make this post hot!
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:59:11
That’s a good idea thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:43:04
Saw something on a other /r that It was moved to Kraken. Not sure tho
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:23:20
Don’t listen to this fucking idiot, I completely believe they would be the type of company to share your private information with others...
@_date: 2018-04-24 07:36:56
My Blockfolio tells me i’m betting against Bitcoin. Been a part of this for about a year now but recently just got back in two weeks or so ago and already doubled my investment. My first thoughts going into this was about the money, but now that I see that this really does have the possibility to over throw the banking system has me hooked.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:03:56
Lets compare bank accounts
