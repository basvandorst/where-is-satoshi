I played with it recently. I didn't match prices to markets, but there is an option to buy or sell based on a market rate plus or minus a percent. So if it's $10,000 you could have a buy price at $9,700 that follows the bitcoin price around. If the price rises to $11,000 your buy price would be $10,670

That doesn't sound very "local" to me. There are probably many places online to sell for bank transfers, etc, but in person for cash or something similar seems to be the best way not to get screwed, right?

I know bitcoin is clunky, and in it's current form is not more convenient than the current status quo. It will be though, then why would we need banks. Once it's easy, fast, secure, and sometimes even insured by third parties (like coinbase for example) there is no reason to have a traditional bank account.

@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:13
Not true. Everyone has their moon, and many won't cash out until it's hit. Riding the ups and downs is the definition of HODL, not sell and try to buy back in later.
Also the tax implications. If he sells $100,000 worth of BTC, and he's in the US, he'll have to pay tax of 30% (I'm probably wrong on the percent). So he'll have only $70,000 to buy back in and get his original coin count back. Holding makes the most sense if you believe in it long term and don't want to take tax hits or guess where it'll bottom out.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:17:27
Pretty sure it was Abraham Lincoln.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:09:11
edit: Let me expand. If you believe bitcoin, or some other crypto will be relevant in 5-10 years, then buy and hold. 
You can try to time the market, and buy at lows, or you can buy at any price, and just hold on to it.
Worst case, you can move the bitcoin into whatever other cryptocurrency takes over (if that happens).
It probably won't blindside you if that does happen. The same is true for bitcoin crashing. If it crashes, you're sure to hear about it. Decide what to do, hold on, or sell for a loss.
If the fundamentals around bitcoin haven't changed, and the technology is still solid, then hold. If bitcoin (the protocol) doesn't adapt quick enough, another coin will take it's place. Therefore it's important that bitcoin stays ahead of the curve. If you see this failing, move some money to the alts that you believe in and hold.

Yes, I remember the question being asked as the price was slowing going down between 14 and 15 "Has something fundamentally changed with the software?"

I never suggest that people buy bitcoin currently as an investment, I only educate them on the technology.
As someone who's been there for the big drops, I know it will happen again, and the chance of it ever going to actual 0 in the next 10 years is almost zero. Someone will always be buying... the forever believer.

Napkin math says bitcoin would be worth roughly 50,000 per coin.
At 5 million users, it's worth ~$250 (easy for math). 
5 million users x 200 = 1 billion users.

Yes, I installed it, and tried it. There was no "browse items" that I could find. Also when I clicked on the two shops that were listed in the sidebar nothing happened. 
I did look at all the config options, and learned about how they burn bitcoins as proof of stake. I don't like the idea of people burning bitcoin, but that's another issue.
The interface was nice, I was glad to see it's based like a website, and not an app. I would use it if it had an easier way to browse item without actually searching in the search box for a specific item.
I will probably try each beta release as I learn more.

Watched the whole thing. The point about only 1% of online sales being a huge impact to bitcoin made me curious.
Best I could find was that 2013 should have been $262 billion in online sales. 1 percent of that is 2.6 billion transacted via bitcoin in a year.
Anyone have a total fiat transaction chart for bitcoin over the past 12 months online? I'd like to see what magnitude 2.6 billion is over what we do now.
Edit, I downlloaded the 1 year CSV chart here  and totaled it al up and the total for the past 12 months was $27,502,709,765 which is about $27.5 billion, or about 10 percent of the online sales? That doesn't make since to me.

I get it. I'm a bit of a developer, and I don't want to store anyone elses private keys either. I think as a hot wallet, everything you do is great, and the spending from other accounts is really only during my trial phase, or spending from cold storage, which I've never had to do anyway. Thanks for the replies.
Last question I hope. What about monitor only addresses, is that something that is possible currently? I'd like to monitor my cold storage addresses for activity and balance checks within your app, but I don't want that total to display in the spending total. Ideally it'd be a password protected area called "cold storage" where I could only view the balance of a set of addresses.

I really only watch MMA, and know that the fighters get bonuses for "fight of the night" or "knockout of the night". The bonuses are about 50,000 I believe, and most fighters try and earn the bonuses.
If the bonus was 10x that amount, I think more fighters would try harder. And I really do believe that if bitcoin grew to the point where every home had at least 1 or two bitcoin users, that things like tipping fighters would be common place.
I'm not saying the only value is due to a collapse in the currency system, but a collapse will happen one day. It could be 10 years from now, 100 years from now, or sometime after that, but all currencies have collapsed, and with the current way governments run, especially the US, I'm sure the dollar will collapse one day too.

Sorry that you had a bad experience. Keep in mind that bitcoin is like email. It all depends on the company you pick to send your bitcoin. If you signed up for an email provider, they could lose your emails, not receive them, and not send them, just like a poorly coded bitcoin service.
The underlying technology in bitcoin is sound, but since it's so new, there aren't many large companies in the bitcoin sphere yet.
As time goes on, more companies, and larger companies will enter the game, weeding out the crappy ones.

Bitcoin just needs the private key for the deposit address in order to be able to spend the funds. I'm not sure how to with the core client, but I'm sure you can export your private keys. 
If you can, that's step 1 and the hard part. Step 2 is take that private key, and import it into another wallet, like for example

But more importantly is this would mean investors will wait for higher returns before investing money in assets. This is bad. It disincentivizes investment, not simply Consumption. This is largely the problem with any deflationary currencies.
Thanks for the insight.  




I don't believe that all companies try to make long lasting, quality products. I believe they make products that appear nice, and can make people think that they are quality at first glance, but infact have a shorter lifespan due to the manufacturing and cost cutting. 
Take for example a cooling fan for your home. With the current system, the biggest motivator when purchasing a fan in store is usually the size, and price. Companies have to make cheaper fans to compete. Now in a society where people were more cautious in spending their money, they would probably buy a fan that would last 10 years instead of replacing a cheap fan every 2 years. 
I just think that when money actually gains value by holding it, then people will be more picky with what they buy, and that means that what they make their buying decisions on will shift towards longevity and quality of the product, and less towards the cheapest, easiest product to buy.
As far as the global currency, I'm talking about a time in the future, possibly 100 years or more, where everyone uses the same currency, and there are no dollars or euros to speak of.
As for the smart property/car example, it's just the blockchain technology that enables this, not bitcoin the currency, but Bitcoin the network.

So the next bubble will peak at 4.5 X 625 = $2812.50 and should happen any day now. 
The first bubble - 40x, then about 20x, then about 10x, so following that, a smaller bubble may happen. It should settle back down at around 1,875 or 3x the price before the bubble.
Now, this is complete nonsense, but it was fun for me to act like I know what I'm talking about.
Please don't take anything above as serious, it's fun to speculate.

I am working on a site for prices, alerts, conversions, etc right now, and I could make some of those features available in plugin form.

Something just happened to me earlier this week to. While providing support for a WordPress plugin that I sell, the customer was accepting bitcoin donations on their page. That was a first.
Second that same day, someone bought the plugin with an address ending in  (something similar, I don't wnat to give the actual domain). So I checked it out, and it was some sort of bitcoin wallet service in the making. 
Cool to encounter two random bitcoin related sites in 1 day.
The plugin is related to Google AdSense, so it's not exactly in the bitcoin sphere.

Hey, it's your money. I'd trust archival quality printed paper over a single USB stick. Now if you have a small handful of USB sticks, you'd be safer, but they could still all fail.
They have metal bitcoin cards too  which use password protected private keys, so all you'd have to do is remember the password to spend the money.

Not sure. Their software was working wrong, and wouldn't let me send outside of xapo, only to other xapo users. I couldn't specify my own transaction fee, and they kept saying I didn't have enough to cover the fee. 
It took many people, but the final straw was me telling them that if it wasn't resolved in 24 hours, I'd take it to social media.
Too bad too, I really want to like them. I've heard about some of their top people, and like the ideas that these people hold, but their customer support, and software sucked.

I guess security mostly. If it's long term cold storage, if one address was to be hacked, hopefully the rest would be safe. Having less per address minimizes possible loss?
Your question did make me think though, you're right for LONG term, power of two is awesome. I'm just afraid of storing say $100,000 (future value) in a single address. 
I think this is a case where "You're right and I'm wrong" as the power of two is interesting for cashing in when ever I do plan on cashing in.

Installed, and sent a spending amount to it. I'll use it for my next transaction, and see how it works.
I noticed though that the receipt isn't even showing up yet, not even as pending. In bockchain it's considered instant when receiving. Usually I buy on coinbase, send to blockchain, then send to cold storage. The delays between my hot wallet and cold storage are usually nothing. I see an instant send option, but not instant receive.
Also in the address book, I can't scan an address, I have to type it out? Wow, that's a pain. Also, can I spend from another wallet without sending the entire amount? What I was hoping for was sort of "Here are your HD addresses, and here are your Non HD addresses for sending from" whereas it would store the keys for my non HD addresses. This way I can send partial payments from other addresses I own, and not mix my funds by sending them all to a HD address.

I just thought that this was yet another example of how badly bitcoin is needed. Even for internal company audits, you can track who spent the money, how much was spent, when it was spent, and in most business cases, who it was sent to.

Maybe that we won't need the law as much as we do today. There doesn't need to be legal proceedings over who owns the title to a house/car if it's as simple as sending a bitcoin transaction. If I own the key, I own the house.
This can be applied to many areas, making the law less needed as a middle man.

No, I just created 100 BIP38 protected address in the past, and am storing a small amount in each address. I was keeping the same amount in each address with the intent of it being only long term cold storage.

You're assuming they know your public and private keys. I'm talking about keeping everything locked up, where no one knows public or private keys.

I want bitcoin to succeed for mostly political/personal reasons, such as sticking it to the man, and managing my own money. I don't own enough bitcoin to make me filthy rich, so I'm not in it for only the possible return.
 I do hope that it hits big numbers though, but that's not my primary reason for being interested.

Also, I don't support their business practices. I know they have to comply to certain laws and that's usually the reason for their actions, but repeatedly they have shown to be a subpar company in terms of customer service.

Titles like this make a bit uneasy. I'm not sure why it went away in the first place, but it sounds like "We took away your 3% discount so that we could keep it for ourselves, but since we lost business, we are giving you the 3% back again".
As I said, without an explanation here in the comments, I have no idea why it was taken away. Or, why we the users had to demand it back again.

A little tip I accidentaly stumbled upon myself: Remove a specific character from the password in Lastpass. 
For example, if your password is: SuperSecurePasswordMan!!!
You can save "SuperSecurePasswordMan" and that is what will auto fill. Then simply at the end, add !!!.
It's a secure way to use lastpass so that if it is compromised, your actual logins are safe.

I have been with them since before their public accounts launched. I've had my shares of deposit issues, site bugs, and more. As a developer, I report the bugs and am usually patient while they fix my account.
It's happened multiple times, actually forcing me back to coinbase once or twice while circle fixed the issues.
I had a recent deposit issue, and issue contacting support, but after they fixed my issues, they send me $25 as a token of their gratitude of having me as a customer, and as a form of apology for the issues I'm facing.
I've never had a company do anything like this, it's very refreshing to know that they do care.
Thanks Circle!

Awww! A little while ago I was playing with my kids, and my 2 year old heard me say "I wish I had a banana" or something like that. So she walked over and said "put a banana" in front of me while setting down an invisible banana.
Then I said "I wish I had a million dollar bitcoin" and she said "put a million dollar bitcoin". If course it didn't sound super clear, but it was soooo adorable.
I hope our kids are right!

Yeah man! if one 10th of 1 % donate $1 bitcoin on a card like that to you, that's about 3 bitcoin you'd take in right now.
I don't think you'd get that much with today's bitcoin adoption levels, but you'd get something for sure if you put on a good fight. Talk about incentive at the higher levels to perform great!

I could get my original investment back at anytime now. I'm not though because it wouldn't change my life, it was a long time ago, and at current prices, there is no way I'd come close to losing my original investment fully. If it ever nears that point, I can either cash out or hold.

Yes, that's what I said in my comment. Passphrase.io is not open source, and if their server goes down, you can't access your data. Also, we do not know if they can see our data or not, being closed source.

He's one of the main reasons I got in back in January 2014. He's said before that he was getting paid his salary/income in bitcoin. I'm pretty sure that he has over 100 bitcoin remaining.  At one point  100 btc = $20,000 which wouldn't have been hard for him to have amassed.

Not a project, but something that fascinates me. Tipping sports players. I love MMA, but the pay can be really low for some. Imagine every fighter/baseball/basketball etc player having their own qr code.
Knock someone out? Hit a game winning home run or 3 pointer? Probably going to get some people's emotions going and get a good amount in tips. It incentives every player to perform at their very best, the better they play, the more they earn.

Wow, the closes accurate guess there was $500 - $10,000. Everyone else was way off.

Nah, just looks at recent price history mainly. I tried to build so many more complex box, but this is the best so far.
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:40:14
They did a long time ago. I uninstalled it and haven't looked back. Can anyone comment if they have the spare change feature again?
This new one looks cheaper though, $1 a month.
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:50:21
Yeah, I like them, but I want to offer people many sources, I have winkdex, bitstamp, coinbase, then I'm lost.
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:37:22
It's 100% more to be exact.

Not an idiot, maybe OP just missed that.

Cool. I searched that on google, are you presenting something?
@_date: 2015-11-03 13:02:56
They sent me an email this morning probably because of my coinbase transactions. They sent the email to other coinbase users to, but not everyone who uses coinbase and USAA will get it.

Do you want big brother saying what you can and can't buy with your money?
If not, transfer it to an independant wallet first, like mycelium. If some of these websites like circle, and coinbase don't like what you're buying, they can close your account.

You must be a long standing poster in I don't want this released publicly freely, as I intend to sell my work after it's all buttoned up. 
Thanks for your interest. After I get my 10 testers, I'll take the video down as to not draw anymore attention to it until it's ready to launch.

I also had 10 btc have the same problem. It was because I was not a fully registered user, and was using only my email address as my registration information. If I had fully revealed my identity, they would have released it sooner.

@_date: 2015-11-04 12:40:34
Isn't it more like 2x the base price?
@_date: 2015-10-27 14:01:40
I got the same email. It was me using mycelium on my mobile to send money to my own alternate address for testing.
On mycelium, it shows "Confirmed: Not broadcasted". I'm assuming it was never confirmed due to a low miners fee of 0.00004174

ELI3? I've read this thread, but still don't get it. This lady is buying bitcoin and CEO of a related company. Why do I have my pitchfork out?

Or a realist...

And they have send out passwords in plain text. Gemini is security focused.

It's not.
@_date: 2017-07-25 10:38:21
Where though? I can't find this info online anywhere of how to actually SEE the private keys. It talks about export or backup, but doesn't list what format it's output in.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:22:23
I wasn't around for the first one, so I can't say.
@_date: 2017-07-25 10:42:43
Right, but how do you get the private keys out into a human readable format? In the event of a spit, no matter which side you're own, it's always best to control the private keys.
Is there a tool online to convert the mycelium seed into private keys?
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:27:44
That's what I was looking for, bip39. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-10-29 13:19:19
Yes, I had them when they opened, but they wouldn't let me withdraw my spare change... I had to go back and forth, and threaten social media to get my 8 cents or so out.
@_date: 2017-07-25 10:46:56
Where other than mycelium can these "extended keys" be restored and spent from?
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:54:03
Why, the hardware/internet required? Has anyone actually done the math using Moore's Law and the pace of Bitcoins growth given an unlimited block size?
If so, given peak transactions, and hardware growth trends, when would this become an issue?
Unless it's not about hardware/internet, then everything I wrote was pointless.
