You think you're making a sarcastic argument against a larger blocksize, but you're actually doing the opposite.
The gold transport industry has already determined their most effective cargo size. It's not artificially limited, but has instead been market-optimized to balance cost, efficiency, and security.  
A more apt analogy would be if they had tried to move $12 billlion in gold bars but limited themselves to 1 bar per plane.  The shipping costs would have been astronomical and anyone in their right mind would have said "put more bars on each plane."

No, it says "the model breaks down". When a mathematical model breaks down, it is no longer a useful model. It can't be used to draw a conclusion on one side or another. 
All he is saying is that we need a different/improved model if we are going to answer the question "What happens when the block reward goes to zero?"

I agree with the ethics... but why move it?
If the address is an easy-to-crack brain wallet, then an attacker can acquire the private key. Thus the attacker looks no different than the initial creator.
So you move the funds, and wait for someone to show he is the owner by signing something on the cracked account... how will you know it is the owner and not an attacker? His signature is the same as the original owner.
They only real "proof of ownership" that is reasonable is if the original owner coughs up a signature in a (significantly) shorter amount of time than it took OP to break the key. 
Sadly, I don't see a cryptographically sound way to ensure the funds end up with the right owner.

No to mention how the "DownTurn Time" sub-chart was literally extrapolated from a whole **2** data points. Oof.

That's a social credit/scoring system. It's about as far from an "honor system" as you can get.

Consider watching the version on Andreas' official channel: 
He deserves your views more than the guy who ripped it off and added some click-baity title.
(not to mention better resolution!)
