Miners wont sell under the profitable but the traders will , its like 90% of Icos now people sell their tokens under ico price 
People think the mining price matters but its not , the demand is.

Just like the time at 2013 btc at 160$ rised to 1100$ then crashed back to 160$ at 2014 .... , im sure alot of people lost their houses at that time , but what if they kept their bitcoin till now ?  If you dont sell , you dont lose .

And bitcoin early 2017 was stable at 1000$ before the bull run , so back to 1000$ ? Nah if it really happened alot of big bois gonna All-in their money then , so easy to be rich huh ?
