The professor is back to haunt BTC. LOL

sad day for the guy...
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:36:28
Please!!! =)

Good luck LiKaShing.  Just-Dice also welcome all gamblers. =)

Not sure if this is such a good idea.  Two wrong doesn't make a right.  Bitcoin users should be allowed to use it to use as they please.  Apple wrong us, doesn't mean we have to take away from customers choice.  We have to be the bigger person.

No opinion on what to call it.  Let's move to uBTC now.  =)  Looks inexpensive to the general public.  Let's go.

They are honest, however sometimes takes many many hours, or days.
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:55:12
Yeah, they lag bad, unfortunately.  However, honest.

Wow so fast! =)

Clean interface! I just learned of eobot, looking forward to trade on it in the future. Thanks for the giveaway!

I'm confused.  Perhaps you can help answer this question.  Do we swap our BTC for Mastercoin via an exodus process?

The owner want me to make a special offer for the Bitcoin community.  Free Cloud Server for 1 year with new managed service agreement. =)
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:22:41
Yes!  I used it over 10 times already. LOL
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:51:18
Coming from someone who can't even spot bubbles he assisted in making...
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:56:36
Oh okay.  I guess the best way if you have Android would be use Mycelium cold wallet function and transfer the coins to your preferred exchange and then make a trade.  Good luck =)

I work at Stepfar Technology and convinced the owner to accept Bitcoin. =)
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:40:30
Ouch.  When did this happened?  I utilized this function a week ago.
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:55:24
This would be an awesome feature!
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:07:13
It takes it from your bank account.  Your card just serves as a backup. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:22:57
I will definitely use this feature.  We spent tons on Amazon each year. =)
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:17:42
I second this!  =)  The new encrypted backup PDF feature is awesome!
@_date: 2013-12-15 03:12:29
You can setup a Coinbase account:
Account settings --&gt; Integrations --&gt; Import paper wallet
Then execute a trade. =)  Good luck!

Experience is like fashion.  What might work yesterday may not work today.  -- What is happening these days is obviously not working.  Something needs to be changed.

Can't really get in and out of the market this way with Coinbase.  The only exchange I trust.  And I believe there is capital gain tax implications.
