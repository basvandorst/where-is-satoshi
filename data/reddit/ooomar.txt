Bitcoin is primed to retest its all time highs. The friggin Wall Street Journal pushed an article making it seem like Peter Thiel was putting money into Bitcoin today, not that he had already invested much earlier. That just tells me the media is going to pile on with good news to help leap Bitcoin to $20K. They all know it's coming anyway, $20K is pretty much BTC's all time to high. They know the market is anxious to retest those levels as new money is rushing into Bitcoin now that the holidays are over. It's better for newspapers to help start the year off with euphoria.

Coinbase is a good place to buy Bitcoin, and if you use Coinbase Pro and place a maker order, you can buy for a fee of 0.15%. Withdraw the BTC to your own address that you hold the private keys for, and they are all yours.

Yeah because sales doesn't mean more cash = more assets, right? Lol. Think before you try to sound smart on reddit. And don't argue that sales doesn't mean profits (correlated to asset increase) because in the case of Nike, it does have profits attached.

Take all the money being put into electricity for Bitcoin's proof of work, the cost of the mining equipment, the cost for labor and space to manage and house the mining operation, and then you will have a BASE value/price for Bitcoin.

Those are the same costs an attacker would have to incur to take over the network. You said there are no assets, and I'm refuting this. It does not cleanly translate from equity stock valuation, we're talking about new territory here, but there are analogies. Think of it this way, Nike spends billions on "demand generation" or advertising to keep their brand relevant and known. This stops new entrants and keeps their market share. That's a cost that leads to an increase in their assets. Similarly, the sunk costs of miners translates into an economic shield that makes it difficult to destroy or taint the ledger: that is our collective asset.

Since Jordan Belfort used securities and the allure of gains in new initial public offerings on pink sheets to swindle people, does that make the entire securities markets and all IPOs a scam? Or does it just make Jordan Belfort a (ex)scammer? I hope you understand my view here.

Inflation encourages spending, deflation doesn't. Your last statement is unsubstantiated. In the bitcoin system, the rich truly do get richer on just the fact of being the rich, in inflationary systems the rich are forced to spend (as in through investments) to maintain their purchasing power, and in that system capital flows and is allocated to production, whereas in deflationary systems it does not make sense to spend something that  will be more valuable on its own.

You tell this guy to get a basic course on finance and economics, but you yourself don't see that market capitalization is  a metric borrowed from *stock market valuations*, traditional currencies do not use a market capitalization metric.
In reality the total sum value of each coin is not the market capitalization, this is a illusionary metric. Did everyone pay $4875 per coin for Bitcoin? If all the Bitcoin came on sale in an instant, would it be purchased for $4875 per coin by new buyers?
