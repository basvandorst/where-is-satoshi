Yeah, this was what I was thinking. Proof that you actually read books about a topic relating to something like job training or as an alternative to some of the more silly degrees out there. Where I live, they want you to have a 2 year tech school degree to be a receptionist or admin. Really what they want is some proof that you actually know how to use excel, quickbooks, and maybe a handful of other programs. There's no real reason you couldn't hire someone who was self taught other than the lack of a simple way to prove that they actually taught themselves.

Don't just go to your local politician. Write up something similar to your OP post, provide some documentation, and read what you wrote in a video, and send it to your local TV, radio, etc. news people. If it gets picked up it will be more likely to be addressed. Post the video on local FB groups, too, and give the elected official's contact details. If a bunch of people are upset about this and what it might mean for their own freedoms, it will help.

If governments want to start banning things that make it easier to evade your taxes, banks aren't going to look that great either.

The government hasn't even really caught up to EMAIL yet.

Cryptocurrencies, TOR, etc. have a bad reputation with a lot of people as only really being used for illegal activities.

Only if you live in a major metropolitan city. 
If you don't, you don't exist.

Equifax isn't the state.
This is rent seeking.
