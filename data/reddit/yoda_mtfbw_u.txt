They just mined a new one, how come it still shows the same difficulty?

Thanks for your very clear info, much appreciated. A new block was just mined, and it shows the same difficulty, how can that be?

Do you have a law background, by any chance?

Is ETH a security now, which can only be sold on a registered exchange?
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:17:40
tell that to UBS.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:07:23
You got it. I am shocked that so few seem to have.
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:18:25
No it doesn't. 
The important concept is that of "value". Money has value, and so do goods and services.
“[T]he ‘investment’ may
take the form of ‘goods and services,’ or some other ‘exchange of value’.”

Does ETH get sold and bought on what walks like a securities exchange?
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:15:16
But actually, this is not really relevant, as the past seems to be the past.
The real question is what happens to an exchange that allows, after this Report, people to sell ETH to each other?
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:56:16
Only coin I know of that wasn't an ICO is Bitcoin...
I even think ETH was an ICO...
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:56:11
Not concerned about past actions. Concerned about future actions, such as allowing trading in unregistered securities.
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:18:06
I agree. But let's expand on the definition of what a security is...
And see where that takes us. Tomorrow....
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:15:27
Well, as securities, they sure as hell better present an accurate description of their risks to people who are investing.
Read a prospectus. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:16:09
And a lot of the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:10:04
ETH is no different than when I buy a non-dividend paying stock on a stock exchange. I I hoping for an increase in the value of my investment in ETH, when I buy it.
Read the Report.
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:07:58
I dunno.
Say I'm a US-based exchange which is not registered.
Say, after the SEC ruling, I continue to allow trading in tokens/securities.
What do you think happens next?

Has Warren Buffet had to invest in ICOs or IPOs to become rich?
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:54:10
But I am sure they verified that you were an accredited investor.
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:20:01
Glad to know some people realize the power of US institutions.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:12:36
I apologize for my passive-aggressive question to you. Of course they didn't verify.
My question to all: was a security issued to a US person who is not an accredited investor?
