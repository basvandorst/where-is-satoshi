It took me a few seconds then I cracked up.

What the Chinese seem not to get is that they only make things worse when they stop losses. Capitalism works because of profit and LOSS. And the loss part is probably more important. The way they try to control the market is arrogant and ridiculous. Losses are an important signal. If you do not let the market clear out poor choices, you do not reward those who make the right choices. The markets are meant to be risky.

Bitcoin is a money. Money is the thing that backs a currency. It makes no sense to ask what is bitcoin backed by any more than what is gold backed by. It is the commodity. If you want to ask what gives bitcoin value? What gives gold value? Scarcity, demand and cost to produce. Time and the cost of digging it up, transporting it, refining it. That's what 'backs' gold. What is bitcoin backed by? It is backed by computation time and the cost of electricity to mine.

That wasn't the goal of bitcoin and it's a sad day if that's what it becomes.

I think we could see $3000. Look at a graph. People have been buying bitcoin just because other people have been buying bitcoin.  If this isn't a bubble, then what the hell is?

The same can be said of alternatives. There's no reason Bitcoin is special in this regard whatsoever. You can easily transfer Bitcoins into other coins and retain the same value in the exact same way. A money cannot retain value and be a store of value if it has no utility as money, and bitcoin's ONLY value is its utility as money, unlike gold which is valued for reasons other than money. Bitcoin cannot flourish in this incestuous state where people only buy bitcoin because other people buy bitcoin. The music will stop at some point, and price is a function of bid/sell. If bitcoin holders can't find a buyer because everyone is just 'holding it as a store of value' then price falls. Bitcoin MUST have active demand to remain valuable. It can only have this if it can actually be used to pay for things. So this whole idea that we can just store our life savings in bitcoin while it becomes useless as a way to buy things like coffee is ridiculous.
"A scientific mind is critical of ideas." - Can only professional scientists have scientific minds? I believe anyone can.
"A 'better coin' will not be better if it's centralized, which it will be if a handful of data centers can serve blocks." - I meant another cryptocurrency.

I've been telling my noob friends to wait for the correction to get in, but no one listens... people really think it's going straight to the moon after hitting all time highs.

I don't really engage in much technical analysis because I think it's just hindsight. I like to look at fundamentals and try to gauge market sentiment. 
Several of my normie friends, who were never interested it when I talked about it with them (since 2011) have all of a sudden started buying it. They told me that at their workplace everyone is talking about getting in on bitcoin. Regular people are getting frothed up into a fervor over it. These people know nothing about it other than it's been going up, and that everyone else is getting in. What happens when some people start getting nervous? How many of these noobs are gonna hold on? Most of them are going to panic sell. They aren't true believers like us who understand its long term potential.
This looks just like back when it went to $1000 and dropped back to $300. I suspect it'll drop back 30-50% and stabilize for a while while everyone cools off.

"You're not a scientist, are you?" - People can't understand reality unless they are employed as scientists?
"It's not some magic system that just works." - Obviously. Don't know why you're telling me this.
"If all Bitcoin becomes is a censorship resistant store of vale that's superior to gold, then that's a noble cause in itself."
Well I respectfully disagree. I maintain that that is very sad. That falls short of its vision. It's not a technical challenge to keep bitcoin as it was intended. It's sad if it becomes much less than what it could be just by lack of will. 
A cryptocurrency's value is very much linked to how much it is used. Why would people keep piling into Bitcoin? The music can stop and stop very quickly. The current surge is a feedback loop of people buying because people are buying. A better coin *can* take over. Let's not all think that the network effect is strong enough to overcome it becoming useless as a money. There's no real difference between storing $50,000 on Bitcoin and storing it on a coin that has next to no fees and fast transaction times.
They have to solve the transaction time and fee issue, or else see it overtaken by a better alternative.
I see a lot of people complacent in Bitcoin's supremacy as top coin. But it is by no means a law of the universe that it must stay there.

Bitcoin has a proper price based on its utility. I don't disagree with that. I didn't say the whole thing is a bubble, I'm talking about current prices. It hasn't surged to $6000+ because people suddenly realized how great it is to buy stuff with it. The current surge is speculative. You can be long term bullish and still recognize a short term bubble. Do we really think it's going straight up from here after so many noob speculators have been piling in?

Those that are not bubbles? lol
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:31:28
Most people, not just millennials, don't know anything about bitcoin or stocks.

The noobs are gonna freak out soon. That's how all bubbles pop.

It's so obvious. Quantum mystics are all the same.
