Thanks for pointing that out, it has been fixed.

No, chances are you aren't.
Freelancing is meant for the 1%, chances are the people that you are exposed to at work are the "brilliant except the stupid part" type like the ones that will develop drones actually believing that they will be used as toys and not as weapons despite the fact that the alogrithms will barely need to be changed before mounting a firearm on top of it.
We strive to deliver a closed, exclusive venue, register while it's free and open. Don't register if you enjoy dealing with the McDerps that don't know what they want on other freelancer venues.

What Chrome version are you using? I have just tried IE, Firefox and Chrome and all seem to display it well.

Pretty sketch? Mind elaborating?
Check the spam folder, we are using our own SMTP server and Google uses a complex algorithm to determine if the email is spam, we need to build up reputation for our server before all emails are not considered spam.

Indeed they are, I am pretty darn sure. Just need to give it time it seems. Thanks for the suggestion!

Are you kidding? We clearly already have SSL, you immediately get redirected to the SSL version of the website when attempting to access non-SSL.

I know coinality, it doesn't offer any of the features we do, they simply let you announce that you're looking for freelancers and get replies to your email. They are totally different.

Okay at first it was clever, now you're just milking it.
An intelligent person that builds drones for the state to mount firarms on is an oxymoron, akin to an intelligent feminist, a smart nazi, a well educated prostitute - you get the point. If he was so smart then he wouldn't be a dumbass.

ITT people that don't know how certificates work

No he was "brilliant except the stupid part", precisely that.

Thanks for the suggestion! We are already working on a new responsive frontend with bootstrap.

We don't currently accept outside capital but if you would like to donate I'd be more than happy, I could even offer you special badges on your profile and other privileges.

LOL, you guys ^_^
I meant freelancing with an actual escrow, on a platform where you are constantly exposed to fellow intellectuals.
