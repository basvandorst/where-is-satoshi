@_date: 2019-10-13 20:37:09
dumb question but where can i buy and store satoshis. I found a satoshi fountain a long time ago but i dont know if ti still exists
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:50:23
Interesting i had no idea you have to give your bank number. Is that always neccessary for holding fiat currency. I remember poloniex would let me buy btc with dollars and then sell that btc for dollars. But i never withdraw btc I always put a certain amount into btc every month. Would i have to give the dude my banking details? Also now that you told me your experience it seems that bis isnt a trading platform like how you trade stocks, more like a exchanging btc for fiat and vice versa with someone else. Is this correct
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:56:30
Dont do it
@_date: 2019-10-14 00:01:42

@_date: 2019-10-13 23:32:01
