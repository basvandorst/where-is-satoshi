Join us in . The general advice is _build the life you want then save for it_. If it really sucks, and makes you miserable, quit it. But if you can get through it with a big reward at the end, perhaps it's worth to suffer for a little bit longer.

Definitely not "easily up to GBP150k" unless you have 15years of experience in a finance industry, or you consider GBP90k to be "up to". I've heard about those jobs, but from the reality is those are very rare and being a mid dev I've never gotten an offer like this from recruiters.

Hey Colin, I'm a coins.co.th user, but your Android app only supports coins.ph. Are there any plans on implementing THB support on android?

This is just selling beer. The vat on beer has to be paid at some point. The producent has an invoice saing it has sold the beer to you, at some value. The tax office knows you owe them vat.

No. VAT on the sale item has to be paid. What the European Court has ruled is that you don't pay VAT on the purchase of Bitcoin.

the third option you are forgetting is multiple currencies. You can have some bitcoins, some dollars, pounds, euros, yens...

Wealth tax. It applies to crypto, cash, properties, stocks...

Have a look at her profile. For less quirky personalities there are art prints and a blanket. Likes will make her visible on the page and very happy. Thanks in advance. [society6 page](

You still owe me 200 quid bro (I planned to buy 2 BTC)

Google for numerical analysis and rounding errors. Float numbers are not precise enough to do any kind of real money business

In smaller, local shops you might have to pay £0.5 transaction fees if your order is for less than £5 (although usually it's free). It's always free if you shop for more than £5. 
Most cashpoints are free as well. The privately owned are charging some fee (don't know how much, free ones are everywhere in the city).
25% sounds dramatic, but only because the cost of milk was £2. If you'd buy milk, eggs and bread you wouldn't pay  transaction fee at all.

I did the same thing. Later on my, when 1BTC was £70, wife wanted to put £2000 in bitcoins, and I was stupid enough not to let her do it...

If you're a .net developer you'll want to use decimal type. 
If you're hacking something by yourself you can store the value as 2 integers. As always, the rule is don't invent things by yourself. There are definitely working and tested solutions in your favorite programming language. Especially if you're not sure how floating point numbers are stored in memory.
