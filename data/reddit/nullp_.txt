Sometime the cost to buy is lower than the cost to mine. At such moments it can indeed be tempting for cloud mining services to buy instead of actually hashing.
A cloud mining service can prove that it is actually mining by distributing the newly generated coins. However most services don't as 100 confirmations are needed before being able to spend the output.
Also, newly mined coins tend to have an higher value as they can be consider in some way as "cleaner" than others.

I am sorry but this is extremely relevant. This is major news.

You actually own a IOU, which basically worths the same as your coins minus the counter-party risk (risk of coinbase default).
If you prefer to have full control over your coins you need to move them over a different wallet (i.e. other than coinbase) where you own the private keys. Consequently, you will be responsible for keeping them secure.
We can compare this to the difference between keeping your gold at home or placing it in an third-party safe (that you need to trust).

Obviously a technical glitch. 
Accordingly to  not a single block got mined since close than 4 hours.

The difference you are describing between the highest BID and the lowest ASK is called the spread.
Unless you are willing to wait for your limit orders to get filled, your only option is to trade where the spread is the tightest (i.e. smaller). 
Exchanges where liquidity/volume is used to be the best (e.g. OKCoin, etc.) are used to have tighter spreads. In any case, places such as Circle.com and Coinbase.com most probably offer much tighter spread than the ones you are describing.
PS: On a side note, although other might disagree, unless you are trading on quite long timeframes, I would perhaps tend to discourage the use of market orders. But this is something else...

This is normal. Here is a chart.

How transaction hashes get calculated. I would move  "scriptPubKey" in a third section (i.e. aside "outputs") to exclude it from hashed data.

Indeed, they are not very prompt at replies. After several attempts to withdraw fiat I gave up, converted back to BTC (at big loss) and withdrew everything (without any problem).
I am confident you will have your money back but I would not recommend them.

Yes, I received mine a few days ago. I made the request in March.
I am very impressed with the work they have done.

Personally, I never experienced any issues. Neither with Royal Bank of Canada nor with RBC Bank (USA).
@_date: 2014-08-22 01:00:02
For the incentive to exist, miners (which already have 100% of the mining power) would need to have a total stake of 100% of the bitcoins. 
If miners stake is lower than 100%, they loose. So, no this will never happen.

Why the hell would the US Government shut down the Bitcoin GITHUB project? We tend to forget that they are the ones who developed and released TOR.

Yes indeed, and I believe the OP question (of course I may be wrong) is in regards to the branch with the greatest adoption (i.e. the one with the greatest worth).

I remember that the information was used to be available. The information is missing since the database crash blockchain.info experienced around March-April.
I don't know if the information is still available somewhere. :-(

No. In fact, a public key (RIPEMD-160) collision would be sufficient. 
Quoting Wikipedia...
In August 2004, a collision was reported for the original RIPEMD. This does not apply to RIPEMD-160. [1]

Dear Michael,
With all respect, can you please explain the reason why you were unable to answer, or even understand, the questions when you appeared before the senate?
I have to confess that I have serious doubts about your candidature. At the same, I am willing to know more about you. I might just be wrong...
Thanks in advance for your answer.
@_date: 2016-09-23 16:45:46
No, the fact that BTC can be easily shorted enable good price discovery.
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:54:06
Indeed. That's right. I am unbiased. I just wanted to know if this kind of disagrement (not to say war) was technical or political.

I am thinking out loud... With all that VC money in miners, isn't there a larger chance that economic support go on the same side?
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:51:08
Thanks, but this is politics. I mean technically, objectively is there any issue? Like a bug, a software crash, etc.

Thanks, but I will rather move away from reddit. No bad feelings, I am perhaps just at the wrong place.

Cmon, NO, Bitcoin does not rely on honesty. Bitcoin is trustless because everyone (especially miners) does everything for its own interest. And here is the magic of bitcoin, everyone's own interest serve the system.
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:50:20
There is nothing to do as this is already going to be the case until transactions start being invalid because of differences in the chains.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:10:38
Thanks. So there is no real way to know before the fact... 
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:56:41
Understood. But we must admit that bcash is running fine (I am referring to the technical aspects of it). Don't worry, I do not support bcash. I am just trying to be as objective as possible. I am an investor, not a believer.

Thanks for raising this. With all respect to him, I have to confess that I share your concerns about his candidature.
His presentation to the Canadian Senate Finance Hearings went so bad that he had to (felt the need to) email the senate committee to correct/precise some of his interventions.
Quote from Mr. Perklin's email to senate committee...


.  
The fact is that, while bitcoin transactions are traceable, the blockchain that holds all transaction information does not record identity information alongside them. This is in contrast with credit cards which require a name, address, and postal code in order to be processed. As a result, one cannot simply look up the identity of an actor who participated in a bitcoin transaction.  
.  
Despite this, a lot of research has gone in to identifying actors on the bitcoin network. While I had mentioned that the IP address of the sender's device can provide some insight into the sender's identity, there are other techniques as well. Research coming out of the University of California provides techniques to cluster multiple separate addresses as being owned by the same actor. Indeed, the way that digital signatures are applied to transactions can easily link these together. A whitepaper describing this technique is available here:   
.  
It's possible that these techniques assisted in the arrests associated with the Silk Road in late 2013, however law enforcement personnel have not yet disclosed details of how they were able to identify the actors involved. The facts that these arrests have taken place, and the fact that bitcoin mixing services are being developed speaks to the fact that bitcoin itself is not an anonymous technology, making it possible to identify actors where necessary.
I hope I've clarified the answer I intended to give to this question. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you require further information.
