bandwidth is not necessarily the bottleneck for bootstrapping a node.
depending on hardware, cpu and disk io can be the limiting factors just as well.

its not the target of rbf.
what rbf does, is to make the worst behaviour a miner currently can have in regard to double-spending the default.
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:33:42
well you could potentially make use of the coins user possess (at a certain point in time) for such a voting system.
ofc this is an advantage for wealthier users.
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:25:36
the problem with fss-rbf, if i understand correctly, is that there is no guarantee that miners are acting accordingly.
even if a miner publicly states he has implemented fss-rbf you cannot prove that he saw/processed a transaction until its in a block. in fact, a miner is better off implementing RBF than fss-rbf because they can earn more in fees (regular bumped txs, as with fss-rbf, but 'evil', real double spends as well)
i would prefer fss-rbf if i knew of a way to circumvent this. otherwise, i think implementing rbf everywhere is cleaner than fss-rbf and the current implementation

its not that simple.
when 'all miners lose equally' the hashing power is used less efficiently against a miner that tries to do a 51%.
but i think the effect of going from 10min to 5min should not be too great in this regard

gamesplanet.com accepts btc as well, i bought witcher 3 (key for gog) and project cars (steam key) there :)
@_date: 2015-05-10 14:27:58
i think the main reason is that it has  more impact on other aspects of the protocol (block reward, halvings, difficulty, diffretarget...)
that said, i would also prefer 5min/10mb or even 2min/4mb instead of 10min/20mb
it allows for more fine-grained control over required security when receiving payments
@_date: 2015-05-02 18:59:35
sure there is, because regular txs will have huge fee if there are many times more tx per time than today
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:37:31
if an attacker has enough power he won't publish a block immediately but instead continue finding further blocks on top of it.
meanwhile the honest miners publish blocks and may have trouble with orphan blocks / reorgs, but the attacker has no such problems

Sure. If a change is not a consensus change, there is no fork at all.


What exactly do you mean by "immediately hard-fork off"?
A will still see blocks of B and C as valid. Why would it not? They are only missing some transactions. How should A even know that B and C follow different rules?
There can be cases in which B and C produce blocks that contradict blocks produced by A (outputs spent to different addresses in A's block than in B&amp;C's block). It's important to understand that this does not make the blocks by B and C invalid!
How do nodes choose if there are multiple chains where all of them only contain valid blocks? They choose the chain with the most work, even if this means undoing transactions (chain reorg).
@_date: 2019-02-13 16:33:21
Full nodes also "trust soft-forks", otherwise they would be hard-forks.
If &gt; 50% of hashrate decides for example to only include txs with a certain fee and they orphan other blocks, your fullnode will still follow their chain.
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:18:11
No, that's not the same.
A hard-fork is a rule-change which produces blocks that older clients see as invalid.
Blocks produced by software which participates in a soft-fork are considered valid by older clients. What makes this rule-change a softfork is the enforcement of it by orphaning blocks which don't follow the new rules.

iirc they also have a 1mb limit, but 4 times faster block target (2.5 minutes)

can you give some reasons for this?

gamesplanet.com accepts bitcoin!
bought multiple titles there (some steam, some gog.com), worked well &amp; cheap
@_date: 2015-07-29 04:55:53
do you remember where that post was?
if i understand correctly multiple signatures are not a problem if you dont receive further payments on said address, because then the  private key for that address is not worth anything (balance on address is 0)
@_date: 2015-07-10 04:11:34
mBTC is more reasonable i think

If old clients accept blocks by newer clients, but not the other way around, it's a soft fork (segwit, for example).
If old clients don't accept blocks by new clients, it's a hard fork (example: increase blocksize without tricks).
@_date: 2019-02-13 19:12:00
You are not wrong, but addressed only half of my post.
If there is a soft-fork in effect (meaning a majority of the hashrate enforces it) your node does not know about, the only thing you see is an unusually high orphan rate.
Example of the soft-fork which only allows high-fee transactions:
Miner A, B and C have 33% of the total hashrate each. You and A run some client-version which tolerates any fee. Miners B and C agree (maybe in private, maybe public) to only accept high fees and enforce their rule.
What happens now? A mines a block with a low-fee tx. All the nodes (including yours) see this block, but B and C don't accept it. Instead they continue mining on top of the previous block. A also might find the next block, but eventually the chain produced by B and C will have more work/blocks (because it has twice the hashrate).
At that point, A and your node will switch to this chain - after all it has the most work and all the blocks are valid.
While your node did accept the block by A at first, in the "long" run none of the blocks of the longest chain will include low-fee transactions.

the theoretical security problem does not arise when an adress only receives tx.
ideally an adress is not used after a tx is sent from it (which means all coins on an adress should be moved in a single tx)

i think i like '103' best, but as mentioned in the comments on github, starting with 2mb might be better

Isn't this mostly the same as uncles in ethereum? Those blocks (actually, the pow done) also contribute to the network's security.

- those disputes cost money - thus fees using btc can be lower.
- there is no problem paying because of additional checks that are needed when paying with credit cards (i had such a problem buying something in the ikea online store recently)
- its harder for someone to get hold of your private key than it is to get hold of your credit card info, because you never have to give your private key to anyone in order to pay

i'm running two relays;
- at home (250/15 mbps connection flatrate), giving about 4 mbps to tor
- a dedicated server (for other purposes) with a limit of 20tb/month, giving about 12 mbps to tor (this server also hosts a bitcoin fullnode)
the connection at home comes in a bundle with tv and phone, ~ 100$/month. the server costs me about 40$/month

cant you just use a bitcoin node thats available as hidden service (.onion address) for that? 
@_date: 2015-03-26 20:08:11
dont use exchanges as wallets, please!
there are nice and save online wallets where you actually hold the private keys (i really like greenaddress.it because they make it even more secure than the regular clientside wallet)
on bitstamp and bitfinex you don't have the keys and thus you lose access if they get hacked/out of business
@_date: 2015-03-24 22:21:19
(sorry, on mobile, thius no deep explabations here)
the private key allows you to spend the funds associated to the key's address. so the coins are not attached to the wallet directly.
wallets usually contain several private keys and generate new ones after you send a transaction.
so called HD wallets generate new keys in a deterministic fashion. this is of great importance for your backups! using classic wallets (like bitcoin core) you have to backup your wallet from time to time but with an HD wallet you only have to backup the original 'seed"' (from which new keys are generated) once.
to make sure the keys are always covered by a backup of an HD wallet, you must not 'import' a private key but 'sweep' it (transfer the coins from the old address to a new, deterministically generated one) when switching from one wallet to another.
@_date: 2015-03-25 04:19:33
i personally use different wallets on different device-"classes"
- mobile: mycelium
- pc: greenAddress (2fa is nice there)
and for savings armory with an offline key

there are services that offer vanity addresses? don't they know 'your' private key then?

or did something change in this regard that i missed?
@_date: 2015-10-05 18:43:56
because the onion-domain itself acts as a kind of certificate.
as long as you know the correct .onion domain you can be quite certain that you're connected to the right server
@_date: 2015-03-25 04:13:22
beware: that is only true for HD wallets
classic bitcoin-qt will lose access to change-addresses this way
