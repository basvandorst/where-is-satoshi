It is a thoughtful question hello. You seem to think it's not shows your ignorance but whatever. Satoshi may not even be a guy so you don't even know stop acting like you do. Go troll somewhere else.

Thinking I may just buy some stock in the power companies as they may well see a rise due to the power requirements...

Italy could well be the next Greece in terms of economic disasters and could also be the first domino to fall in a row of many triggering a major world wide financial crisis... and I'm not just retired USMC guy at home sippin on a tall cool one saying that but others who know more about this than I do. HODL -  MOON! Grace and peace ya all!

Well it seems to grow dicks, look at you.

No it shows I'm new and wanting to ask questions and find out and really shows your lack of understanding. Is that how you treat all people who have a normal question. Good God I hope you don't breed and have kids I would hate to have you as a parent. You failed to even EXPLAIN LIKE I'M FUCKIN 5 you have yet to even give one credible post with any info what so ever. In the Corp you would be beat down and shit on for your lame ass attitude. Semper Fi Mother Fucker!

My friend suggested we buy some land in a sunny part of the state and set up a solar powered mining rig.

Hello was looking for some help. Don't know much about all this but I know enough that I need to know more and be involved on this for the future, my wealth and for my family. I recently bought 1K in BC and $500 in Ethereum via Coinbase. Now I am curious about these keys I read about and having a wallet... I downloaded a Blockchain wallet but am still trying to learn about all this. What advice can you offer. How do I get the keys? And what's the QR code for each account? Is that a way to transact BC at places and with people? If I share it how do I authorize people to get paid? Lots of learning still to do so anything you can do to help this old guy out would be great. Thanks!

True, could be I always question everything. I would hope that you are right in that it would spawn innovation and God forbid we ever get Free Energy the like Tesla was working with... Game Over
