Thought I and others obviously appreciate the reddit gold, wouldn't a cointip for the same value be a better way to spread the BTC goodness?
That or [this]( I think increasing the number of businesses who know what BTC is and actually accept it would be amazing.

The 'Top players' page isn't working properly. It renders the page seemingly before waiting for the scores to be calculated. The result can seem misleading, players dropping off the table, rankings changing wildly.
The mine page shouldn't refresh, save on time/resounces and only update the parts of the page which are required. In this case, load the new game when the timer runs down, not the whole page.

You've gone from saying "Everyone's goal" to "my goal". It's absud for you to claim that everyone has the same goal as you.
You say:


If your goal is simply to hold as many coins as you can, how can you expect to increase the number of users? If as you claim this was "Everyone's goal", the entire model would fall apart.

Yes, I think you are running a version of PHP which isn't supported in this library. I suggest upgrading to a more modern release. PHP v5.4 (minimum version this lib will work with) is from 2012. Use [composer]( when installing. Composer will install missing dependancies, and tell you about php version compatability, this is covered in the documentation:
**Edit** Note the installation section of the README, it lists required dependencies, and gives examples on using composer to make installation easier.

I think people are comparing apples with oranges here. From a hardware perspective the Rpi Zero simply doesn't compare to the Rpi2, shipped as the basis for 21 incs device.
* It only has 512 RAM, you can't run a full node on 512 RAM. Rpi2 has 1GB
* It has 1 core, vs 4 more powerful cores on the Rpi2.
* It has no networking device, Rpi2 and previous Rpis (apart from the SoC and Rpi A) have a built in RJ45 100MB network port.
* 21 inc ship a device with an ASIC miner chip. This does not.
Minor nitpick:
* 21 inc ship a 128 GB Micro SD card, fully configured with their software and the blockchain, the Rpi Zero does not.
Note that the running of the OS and minimum 16MB reserved for the GPU blob mean you have less that 512 RAM to play with. Software wise this does not include the 21 software stack, while it may be achievable to install for a short while I'm sure they'll work around this (as speculated elsewhere on the sub).
It's disingenuous to claim this as a competitor to the 21 inc hardware (remove software and the fact 21 provider a miner ASIC), clearly they aren't the same.
@_date: 2015-03-27 11:06:58
I prefer the original:
@_date: 2015-11-26 16:03:42
Yes, this is a consideration for the future, however for the present the Pi Zero has is simply not the up to the task at hand, and shouldn't be compared to the Pi2, regardless of the what else the 21 device does.
