Can someone please explain what it means for BTCChina? Will it be still a legal exchange?

you mean 1$, we are using mBTC nowadays ;D

Hmm. Yes, you are right. But anyway, for someone new to Bitcoin, buying "something virtual" for just 8 cents seems much more reasonable then buying it for 80 USD :) Last but not least, there will be only 21 milion BTC so "denomination" at some point seems unavoidable.

so 0.8 USD for 1 cBTC then!

Honestly I think it'll be necessary soon anyway to stabilize the price. BTC price is going crazy nowadays but making mBTC the default would make it much more stable. It's because daily change from 0.07 to 0.08 for mBTC no longer looks so scary. But if the price goes from 70 to 80 USD in one day then it looks completely different (like a bubble which it probably isn't)

What do you mean? Satoshi is 0.00000001 BTC 
but mBTC is just 0.001 BTC and it's much more natural these days when the price is so high.

The guy is shouting "Either I'm going or I'm not going!!!" and "I guess I'm going!"

Can't really do that without decent Windows Phone wallet :( For me the easiest way to spend it is by buying some food but I don't have Android anymore :(

WARNING: user "Chrisarnesen" again removed the infobox! He has also removed the information regarding controlled supply: "New bitcoins are created at an ever-decreasing rate.". I think we should also include the following information: "The number of Bitcoins generated per block is set to decrease geometrically, with a 50% reduction every 4 years."
