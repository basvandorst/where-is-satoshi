True.  Still, SOMEONE has to be paying coinbase a shitton of fees on that crazy volume.  I don't think getting a 20% discount is really worth it even if it is a team.  But lets see... according to bitcoincharts, 100K bitcoins were traded in that 12 hour period.  which judging from the deviation from the baseline volume around that time period was likely one or two entities driving almost all of that volume.
For 100K bitcoins traded Coinbase gets .25% (assuming no current discount we don't know about)  That means 250 BTC or around $115K at the current price.
The lowest fee possible is .10%.  Best case scenario is for each Bitcoin they ~~sell~~ trade after this in the next 30 days they will save .25% - .10% = .15%
.15% * 1 BTC = .0015 Bitcoins saved per MARKET HITTING trade made.
So if you paid all the fees for that insane amount of volume, you would need to do 250 BTC / .0015 BTC per Trade = 166,667 BTC in MARKET HITTING trades in the next 30 days to make it worth it.
Lets be generous and say you only paid 125 BTC in fees in that 12 hour time period because you were able to place a lot of post-only bids and offers and get other parties to hit you.  In that case you would only need to do a little over 80K BTC in market hitting volume that next month.  Before the current spikes it looks like coinbase would do 250-300K traded in a month.  The current 30 day volume is up to 410K though.  So you would need to do around 20% of that personally hitting existing orders to make this worth it.  And you will probably make some markets of your own so that would only be part of your total volume.
So it seems you would need to get an even greater volume next month to make it worth it.  But in that case you practically be the biggest trader on the exchange anyway and you wouldn't really need to do this to pump up your volume and get over the threshold to get the biggest bonus anyway.

They expect a single account to be responsible for over 20% of their trading volume?!  Seems a little ridiculous.  I feel that even 1% would be hard to get.

I figure it's mostly the ongoing Chinese stock market collapse that started around the same time.

no, these will do nothing to affect price, just a bot running some strategy with way to many orders

"A scanned signature image for Mitt Romney from the 1040 forms were scanned and included with the packages, taken from earlier 1040 tax forms gathered and stored on the flash drives.""  [source](
  
That would pretty much prove it for PWC and romney camp.  
Unfortunately that means the opposing side is left in the dark as to authenticity and have little chance of raising the $1M if they cannot receive proof.

Contact Coinbase support.  Probably a bug in their backend software.
