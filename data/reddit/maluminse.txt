Central currency global control. Cash is limited. A crypto currency cash is eliminated. 
Why so little resistance? Replacing the dollar has met mass resistance. World bank protesters arrested or killed.
Now, fine let the market caps become billions and billions?

Dumb or a liar right off 
He's confusing equity securities with currencies. Oh and he's a copy cat. Other writers who trash crypto say the same thing.  No intrinsic value. 
Currencies aren't like stock in a company.
Under the gold standard currency 'did'. Even gold is based on a belief. It's a rock.
Crypto is more like gold than the dollar. Why? Bc crypto is limited. 
However the endless coins created seems to belie that original fact. Sure bitcoin has a cap but if countless coins cam be made how is it limited.
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:08:05
Sounds spot on to me. I was thinking this before you posted it. 
People say its so anonymous but it doesnt seem very far from being traceable. 
And of course the only way governments wont ban it is if its traceable. Otherwise the claims of drugs and laundering would be true.

The response to this is very interesting. I think people are emotionally struck this b/c they are delusional.
If youre not frugal you will lose the money you have.
This we can agree on.
Thats all this saying is importing.
So many athletes and lottery winners are now poor. Why? They spent like they were rich and became poor.
People who break six figures and buy a new luxury car and an overpriced condo would quickly be in the poor house if they lost the six figure job.
Whereas the person who buys a cheap car and a reasonably priced mediocre home and invests the rest will be wealthy even if they lose the six figure job (depending on how fast)
There are movies made about this.

You're not stupid. 
The statement means if you don't live frugally you likely will end up poor.
The athlete or lottery winner who spends it all in a year lived rich. And they were. 
Poor people, as a constant, spend like they're rich meaning they spend more than they have. And end up poor again.
Poor people with nothing at all to spend can't spend like theyre rich. 
But that is part of the saying.  Many people who are poor and spend like they're poor become rich.

Yep even pro athletes.
My uncle on my moms side worked at Sears and his wife a teacher. When he died they owned three houses, a 4 plex and a small ranch in Texas. He was a as frugal as they come. Same American cars for the extent of his life. Old truck. 
Made his own wine. Never went out. He was an awesome human being though. 
On the other side, a cousin, owned a multitude of houses. He's pull up in a pain splattered old truck. Overalls and a grungy appearance. No one would guess he was a millionaire.

Some caveats, life maxims are lost on some. Not everyone takes away from philosophy or prose the same. 
I think it's a good saying that means a lot. No it's not a math formula. It's food for thought. 
Ok you don't agree. Such is life.
Or you take issue with that saying? 'Such is life'.
How about 'neither a borrower nor a lender be'?
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?

Actually quitting those habits and closing your fridge does make people rich.
I stated earlier. My uncle worked for Sears, his wife, my aunt, was a school teacher.
When he died they owned three houses, a 4plex and a ranch in Texas.
He was very very frugal. No Mcdonalds, all old cars (American made), home made products like home made wine.
Hes gone now but my aunt is a millionaire and yes has bought a late model Ford for her and her daughter. But it would not have been possible absent their frugality.

Oh yes. No Romney is off his rocker. But it is an example of very wealthy being frugal. Of course their frugality at times is more expensive. Dare I use another saying:
