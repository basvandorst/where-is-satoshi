Step 8: Fattening Intensifies. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:03:05
Since two-bit idiot lost his faith and "sold his 65 coins" he has been a bitcoin antagonist. There are more proactive ways to go about cleaning up the board than this. 
If you are a bitcoin advocate, why would you ever threaten to take potentially damning information to news sources, who will only paraphrase those comments to spread more FUD about bitcoin? 
2-bit idiot is a pathetic asshole, and as a bitcoin participant, I don't see him as being any better than these board members that he wishes to oust. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:32:05
Well it's stupid because the market is saying there's a 95% chance those coins are worthless.

You know, people have accused as being a circle jerk. Well, is just the same. 
"This comment has not been in a very shibe-spirit" ousts you as a dogecoin circlejerker and nullifies the better parts of your argument. 
And on top of that you attempt to instigate a dogecoin tip chain and splooge doge all over this thread.

The ASIC race has nothing to do with causing people to leave and mine dogecoin. If that were the case, you wouldn't see more people buying ASICS and the difficulty curve rapidly increasing as you do today. If mining was not profitable, miners would then leave and the difficulty curve would decrease. 
Furthermore, Dogecoin uses Scrypt so it cannot be mined with ASICS, why would people switch to a coin they couldn't mine, after they bought their hardware?

I would recommend seeing if your city has a bitcoin meetup, or buying off of localbitcoins.com if you would prefer a person to person exchange rather than signing up and getting verified online.

I don't have a problem with the opinion. This is what I have a problem with, to be clear:
"Otherwise, by Monday at 3pm ET / 12pm PT, I will post my full expose of the unprofessionalism and negligence of the Bitcoin Foundation.  (If I get hit by a bus this weekend, my lawyers will release it.) 
In addition, and immediately upon publishing that expose, I plan to provide a collated and annotated document dump to Fortune and Wired to let them make their own professional judgments of the Bitcoin Foundation and our industry’s current leadership.  (I am doing this for free, I might add.)
On Wednesday, I will share those same documents with the broader media community, including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, the Verge, Forbes, the Associated Press and anyone else who asks, and begin lining up on-camera media interviews with CNBC, CBS, Fox News, Al Jazeera and others who have expressed interest in this story to date. 
I assure you, I am ready to go nuclear." 
His opinion is expressed on his blog, that's fine. It can even be linked to here so we can read it! That's fine. 
But I take exception to his attempt at blackmail, and to his will to spread FUD via news outlets. That is beyond opinion, and is antagonistic behavior.

In financial terms, an investment is different from speculation. Speculation often refers to less stable, high potential return, and generally high risk (stock market trading typically falls into this category). Investment normally refers to a safer bet, low return and low risk, and a generally better sense of security (mutual funds, real estate, etc). At this point all cryptos would be considered extremely speculative. 
So, you'd be correct to use the term speculate if you are talking about people hoping for a financial gain, or you would use support if you are talking about people buying in for a cause. 
On a side note it's nice having someone who is at least partially into Dogecoin actually respond to me with genuine curiosity. My main problem with that subreddit is that I can't seem to have intellectual discussion over there. I am always bombarded with anti-bitcoin rhetoric. Most often, rather than having a conversation with discussion points, I get a wave of people telling me crypto is about community and "that's what Dogecoin figured out that bitcoin doesn't have," regardless of the point I was trying to make. Though I will admit I may be a bit dry for many people.

Nice I've always felt that to become a real player, Bitcoin would need a Beef to BTC exchange to open up. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:36:20
I think the problem you are having is that you are basically advocating that the the bitcoin community embrace a well known threat to bitcoin in order to restore funds to users who trusted a third party with their coins. Why would anybody pro bitcoin want to make it look like the protocol could be compromised for anything? A hard fork may be able to help in the ways you mentioned to restore some wealth to those who were goxxed, but it would hurt bitcoin's reputation in the long run. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:04:49
I agree with you here and will admit that I could have done better with that post, I was too reactive this morning. It has been a pretty rough couple months in the news, and I think the community is tired of hearing about bad actors(though they need to be known so that progress can be made). We need more innovation and less bickering.

In case you weren't around this morning, my "open letter to two-bit idiot" was a sarcastic response to an open letter that two bit idiot wrote this morning and has since deleted, I'm not a huge fan of them either.

Then maybe you should try to learn, rather than try to influence others by posting nonsense rebuttals every time someone attempts to answer your naive question. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:18:09
The point you are missing, is that real investors don't invest for fun, they invest to make money. Saying "anyone who invests in Dogecoin, who's not an idiot" is an oxymoron, because no intelligent being would consider making an "investment" in any crypto without that "investment" being purely speculative. Switch "investment" to the word support and you make a little more sense. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:00:02
It's unreasonable at the expense of the Bitcoin protocol. I have held bitcoins for years and managed to avoid loss by keeping them in cold storage and not trusting third parties. There will be a time when regulation allows third parties to be trustable, but that time has not yet arrived. 
I would also pose the question "What's the use of recovering lost assets if in doing so, you are abusing the protocol and threatening the value of those very assets you wish to recover in the process?" 
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:37:19
Exactly, so why do you think it is in any way beneficial to anyone that you take your information to news companies like this?

Yep, two bit idiot is just a bitcoin antagonist who cares about furthering his own reputation. Taking any negative info to the press and portraying yourself as a bitcoin insider will only lead to FUD and more damage to bitcoin's reputation.
