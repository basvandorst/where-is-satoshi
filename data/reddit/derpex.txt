Obviously more people are using Windows than Macs, because Windows have had such an enormous head start and essentially a monopoly for the longest time.  That's meaningless.  
  
The majority of Macbook owners love their computers, myself included.  They are sturdy, built very well, last a long time, and are well designed.  The fact that more people are using Windows as well doesn't offer any evidence either way in this regard, which was your original argument.

I'm operating under this assumption as well.  Not only is their team incredible, but they've got some *awesome* things in the works.  I *LOVE* VoS.  For Canadians, it's unparalleled really.  For international users, it's still very competitive.
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:00:17
But what you posted literally makes you the exception, not the rule, right?  Apply some logic.  Obviously not 100% of people like Apple products, as with anything, but

That's certainly good news.  Hopefully we can have a large amount of competition to keep the market best for the consumers. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:35:46
Has BTC-E given us reason to be wary of it though, other than being simply anonymous?  Why run now when you could make a killing in the long run on fees?  As far as we've seen, simply putting your face and name to something doesn't make it legit.

I have actually, and I did really enjoy it for the short time I got to use it.  Unfortunately, there are a few things I wish they did differently.  The massive ring around the camera, in my opinion, looks really ugly.  Next, the "nexus" lettering is really awkward (again IMO) and I wish it were made of metal rather than plastic.   
  
They're small things but to me they're important.  Also, despite these things I came very very close to ordering a nexus 5, but, after watching numerous reviews, it seemed like the consensus was that the nexus 5s screen was slightly more washed out, the sound quality was slightly worse and so was the battery.  The OS though was really fun to use.  I feel like LG is getting better and better every year with their nexus line so I'm just waiting for that one phone. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 18:51:44

I have faith that they have their shit together.  One of Canada's major credit reporting agencies, Equifax, which wouldn't team up with any other Canadian exchanges (even virtex iirc) decided to do business with VoS as a testament to their professionalism.

I don't see why...
@_date: 2014-02-03 05:23:56
Because you aren't the original poster, and the original poster stated he already had bitcoins he wished to spend... so... he is getting a bonus.  
  
Also I'd like to point out something.  The fact that TigerDirect is willing to take bitcoins for goods sort of makes it real money.  
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:42:39
I did the same and lost, even though I provided them with all the proof. Guy on the phone said they don't have digital goods protection for sellers.  Unfortunately it was for .5 when btc was 1000+ so he had sent me 500 which I immediately spent, and when paypal did a chargeback I was on the hook for 500$.   
  
This was unfortunate because fuck paypal, I'm not giving them my money.  My saving grace was that I'm 17 and their own user agreement states you have to be 18 to use PayPal, and as an extension of that would be to hold debts, so I just called paypal collections and explained that I'm 17 and faxed over my drivers license for proof and it was done.  Otherwise I think I would've been fucked because I started getting calls from some collection agency that I guess paypal sold my debt to. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:15:01
If ECDSA had a flaw to it that was uncovered, wouldn't bitcoins become essentially worthless?  ie who cares at that point if someone steals them.

Yes, I would take it with a box of salt (heh), but it's up to you to decide.  He released the crisis document which was confirmed by Karpeles to be true, so I'm in inclined to believe him.  Whether you choose to is up to you, though.
@_date: 2014-06-10 08:54:06
Conventional wisdom would say that it's probably better to be upfront with your bank from the get go so as to clear everything up right away and not run into trouble in the future.

What a useless concept.  You know like 99% of a cops job involves neither shooting nor tasering.  Armed robbery response?  Ok, it's inside.  GG drone.  The only useful thing I can think of would be catching speeders on highways which some departments currently use planes for.

Yes but when the time comes that you can steal bitcoins from addresses to which the public keys are known, won't bitcoin already be worthless?
@_date: 2014-01-14 05:24:34
Toronto here.  I've mentioned bitcoin a few times on my Facebook (mostly about Coinkite) and have had a few friends ask about it, and as well I distributed some bitcoin debit cards that Coinkite sent me to the people in my business class.  Some people (mainly business-oriented) have been receptive, but most don't see the value outside of what they've heard in the news about it being a highly speculative risky investment, unfortunately.

Everyone to Vault of Satoshi!  Based out of Brantford, Ontario (an hour from Toronto), very quick verification and they are rolling out very convenient deposit options for Canadians! (e.g. they've just released on-site deposits via Interac Debit cards at their HQ to test Interac deposits, but if it goes well they said they're looking at expanding the network!)

You might not ever want to look at a comment thread in r/Dogecoin, that would *really* offend you.

Well if he wants to buy something with bitcoins, he should go buy enough bitcoins to buy that thing with bitcoins.  The fact that he doesn't have enough isn't bitcoins fault.  This isn't a problem with bitcoin.  I can't buy 3/4 of something with my debit card and the other 1/4 of it by sending the company cash in the mail (note: wrt e-commerce, obviously).  I would have to go deposit the cash into my bank so that I can pay for the item.  
  
Yes, that would make chickens real money.

Bitcoin is getting easier to acquire every day.  Even now, it's not hard at all.  I welcome your skepticism but I don't agree with it.  Personally, I also have times of doubt about bitcoin, but when you look at the grand scheme of things, there's *a lot* of shit going on, and a lot of money involved.  Something like this doesn't just go away.

Eh, I'm with TD and I used to do (before they released Interac deposits) deposits to VoS with Vogogo, so it's on your end, not TD.  
  
Also, I submitted to be verified to VoS, Virtex and Bitstamp around the same time a while ago - two of three verified me very quickly, the third took massively longer.  I'll let you work out who was which.

Vault of Satoshi is adding Interac through InstaBT soon, allowing you to purchase up to your accounts daily limit (which is quite high) if you're verified.

I refuse to argue with someone who thinks aesthetics of a device are not important to a lot of people.  Why isn't everything designed in the most utilitarian way possible then, as opposed to looking nice?  Apple has *brilliant* design, it's a large portion of their business model.

I sent in verification to VoS when I was 17 and was verified, but they say you need to be  18.  I turned 18 yesterday so it isn't an issue anymore but you might try that.

As a pilot, I was wondering when a charter company would start accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-01 00:44:54
Announced Overstock to take BTC, says at the time he wasn't holding any.  Maybe he was expecting a big rally and so didn't say anything (if he did own them).  Rally doesn't happen, he announces he's now got millions worth.  Another pump attempt?  Maybe.

Virtex isn't anywhere near a bitcoin debit card.  It's literally just a normal debit card where your exchange account balance is your card balance, but you must first sell on the exchange for fiat... ie there is literally no use of this except very limited ones.  It's a fiat debit card, not a bitcoin debit card.   
  
Coinkites is indeed a bitcoin debit card, in that it is literally the same as Interac debit, but it works on the Coinkite infrastructure as opposed to Interac (because Interac doesn't deal with bitcoin).  It works on Coinkite POS.  There is nothing out there that is more a bitcoin debit card than what Coinkite offers.  
  
You're also wrong in your assumption that it has to work on Interac ATMs and POS to be a debit card.  It is a debit card, just not Interac debit. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 00:35:26
I feel this way too.  Every time I started feeling like bitcoin is not going to succeed, I take a step back and look at everything going on in the bitcoin sphere.  It's just hard for me to imagine bitcoin not succeeding.

When it comes to keeping money with an exchange, I'm 98.9% sure I read that it's all insured on VoS.  I think that while they are expanding "quickly" (faster than VTX really isn't a metric to go by, IMO), I believe they are meticulous in making sure they are doing everything correctly, safely, and legally.  Shutting down in the US wasn't forced by the US govt, they could have kept operating, but they decided to be proactive with people's funds before it came to being an issue.   
  
All of your points are valid though.  I guess to me, I really like what I'm seeing with VoS and in my mind there are no doubts at all that they will always put customer safety first.

That's not a marketing gimmick.  That is literally what a Bitcoin debit card is.  What you are describing is a fiat debit card.  
   
For many, the stated end goal for bitcoin is when they don't need to convert back to fiat.  If we go by this definition, Coinkite's debit card is exactly what a bitcoin debit card should be.
@_date: 2014-04-22 00:15:16

If the gap isn't worth your time to arbitrage, then does it really make that much of a difference when deciding where to buy?  You might get less, but it will be negligible.

I came really close to getting a Nexus 5, but I just couldn't.  Every review I watched said the Nexus 5 was pretty much equal but *slightly* worse than the iPhone 5, so it really didn't make sense for me.  I did use the Nexus 5 in store and really liked the android OS, but the build quality of the phone and design decisions (i.e. camera, building materials, form factor, speaker quality) held me back.  I still would really like an Android phone, but they're just not where I want them to be yet in terms of actual phones.  If I could have Android on an iPhone 5, I would.

Definitely +1 for VirtEx.  Bought my first bitcoins the other day after the initial crash, and it seems faster (for Canadians) than a lot of these other ones listed.  4-8 hours on a cash deposit I put in at BMO (right next to my house), worked great.  Also you're correct in that there isn't much panic selling going on, it's been steady at $80-$90 all day pretty much.

The corollary to that is that everything you buy now costs double.. so..
@_date: 2013-12-21 23:13:56
I used Coingig. I was trying to get 1.3BTC I to paypal money rather quickly so I was buying it on there.  I bought most from CoinTrade, who is legit, but $500 from a guy named paypalexchange.  He sent the money so I released the escrow, but he charged back the next day.  Paypal sided with him regardless of all evidence I provided.  Oh well, I spent the money before he initiated the chargeback so it's just paypal holding the bill for this one. My paypal account is negative 500 but I'll just leave it until they close it or whatever they do.   
  
tl:dr, coingig is legit, support is fast but nothing they could do unfortunately except ban the user.  
  
Also interesting to note that you have to submit a ticket to get escrow released... like a release funds button is literally a "future development" item. Big wat there.

Yeah it does feel the same, except there isn't any raised lettering.  Also it's see through if you put it up to light which I just noticed and is really cool.  
  
And they all have different bitcoin addresses on them.  The way it works is that at the top there is the number, and top left is the initial PIN, so you go to the address on the card and then do your first time set-up and add it to your  account.  I don't know why you would want more than one card though.
