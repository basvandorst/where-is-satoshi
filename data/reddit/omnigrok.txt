Dude... You see his posts, you're replying to them. How exactly is *this* account then shadowbanned or deleted?
@_date: 2014-04-30 02:21:55
Not while still asking the legitimate owner to prove ownership.
@_date: 2014-08-13 02:48:37
Sure, the dependent claims are always the actually interesting ones.

Pretty much. Assigning meaning to pretty shapes.

The stockpile.com site he links to presents a cert not trusted by my browser. Anyone else seeing that?

Amazon will also let you have the whole physical host for a bit more, if you request dedicated instances when launching. Intended for people who worry about these sorts of issues (and for people who have regulatory compliance issues).

I like this because in a sense, with sidechains, colored coins, etc it is exactly a metacurrency - a currency used to create other currencies.
@_date: 2014-04-30 02:21:16
Markov chains could be trained to predict that. Just a little more complicated than a dictionary attack.
@_date: 2014-06-01 01:33:10
I mean why not, right? It's a cryptcurrency.
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:36:58
Wasn't there a post that they were shipping? I assume they have a backlog of preorders.
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:13:52
Okay, so is the license you're referring to analogous the various states regulations on Money Services Businesses? So like, Coinbase probably has an EU license and 50 US licenses?
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:26:56
My bet is that they don't throttle login attempts, so someone just spun up a botnet to brute force passwords.
Evidence against it would be if folks claiming to be hacked had high-entropy passwords, but those folks tend to be rare.

Well, at least it's not the one from BFL, in that vein.
@_date: 2014-08-07 18:14:39
This sounds like a language issue. Was the original message in German? The English message as written does indeed mean they would have refunded without the ID.

Ah, no, can't say I have. Is that what they're referring to here?

Also, this particular open source project is dedicated to cryptographically secure mobile to mobile messaging, which is probably near and dear to the bitcoin community's heart.

0.99BTC is like 105USD... a bunch of folks didn't buy at the higher price, and now it's been dropped as a result.
@_date: 2013-09-08 19:16:02
Same issue here. Buying things from Newegg gets my card shut off every time. I love the discovery part of the site, but check out sucks and it's largely due to the way they process payments.
@_date: 2013-05-08 17:27:06
Common prime factors.
@_date: 2013-06-16 06:52:16
Hey, I feel like I'm in the minority on this, given the number of sites out there that don't bother, but I like to vape unflavored liquid - and I don't see it for sale on your site.
I love that the eCig community appears to be embracing BTC, but haven't found any sellers accepting BTC that also sell unflavored liquid yet. Any chance you might add it?
@_date: 2013-08-26 19:09:20
Yeah, unflavored with nicotine - it's the only thing I've been unable to buy with BTC no matter where I look.
@_date: 2013-04-29 02:24:42
To an exchange, not an online wallet. They're presumably going to want to spend their tips in their local economy which overwhelmingly uses fiat. To turn BTC into fiat, you need an exchange, and for the most part a bank account. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 00:45:32
The article seems a bit out of touch. "You can use an app called blockchain", and a screenshot showing a 50.00BTC transaction?

Currently  on Congrats! 
Also, probably a lot of newbies incoming, so let's show some love, folks.

Maybe group buys through an exchange? 
@_date: 2013-05-14 07:16:32
They have already adjusted. The losing transaction outputs are the exact minimum the new client enforces by default. 
@_date: 2013-07-15 05:56:31
That would be the sane thing to do, but it certainly raises some questions. For example, does it help anyone to send an email with a non routable address? What other security mechanisms are trusting the easily spoofable header? 
@_date: 2013-06-16 17:15:36
Including the nicotine, yeah. It's useful for smoking in the office, since it doesn't have a smell. 
@_date: 2013-07-15 06:47:02
Not really. If the users get pissed, they can fork the chain, and leave the miners with a devalued currency. 
Edit: I should say "not entirely" - the miners still have a good deal of influence, as if enough compute power doesn't hop over to the fork, then it's still in trouble because of potential 51% attacks.
@_date: 2013-05-12 05:28:06
Check for yourself.
@_date: 2013-04-26 01:38:43
Third theory: They underestimated the difficulty of building a custom hardware product from scratch, and while it's totally feasible to do it took far longer than they expected.
They weren't necessarily malicious originally, just optimistic, like many people who haven't run large hardware or software projects before (and indeed, even many who have such experience). Then they communicated the slippage of their dates poorly.
@_date: 2013-06-25 05:52:10
From their website, seems it's only via the Android app or the web site. ([Source](
@_date: 2013-07-08 05:17:29
Miners care in general because their delivery rate impacts the difficulty. All of their customers are miners.

What about changing the classpath when launching the app? May be out of scope for a library, but is there any guidance for app developers?

That's a misconception. To move chips inside of China you still have to clear customs. Most semi companies are in [Special Economic Zones]( and you still have to pay duty to export them elsewhere in China.

Selection bias. Most people on r/bitcoin are more likely to think that. For all we know, a large chunk of their business is from non bitcoin related transactions.

Deliberately making false statements with the intent of deceiving customers into giving you money over the internet constitutes wire fraud, I think. The FTC might be interested.

Sounds like fun. Can I get JTR using it if it becomes uneconomical for mining?

Confirmed, same behavior for me.

Great, thanks for the story. And this shows what about Dwolla's dependence on Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:58:13
The boot scripts will basically just invoke swapon anyway.
I would move it to the end to prove to yourself that bitcoind comes up on reboot.
@_date: 2013-07-28 01:07:19
That's assuming zero development costs. Building and vetting anything cryptography related is expensive (and for good reason - it's really tricky to get right!)
@_date: 2013-08-24 21:26:03
It may not. It just boggled my mind the first time I found out about it.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:38:30
Huh, I (a new user of CampBX) was impacted by at least one Dwolla bug - they claimed it to be on Dwolla's side. CampBX credited me with $0.25 less money than I sent (even after the Dwolla transaction fee), which was some kind of human error due to them processing transactions manually.
Not sure what the issue is, exactly, but MTGox did something similar a few months back, I believe, requiring people's Dwolla account to be older than a certain age before it could be used to send funds into MTGox.
A shame that they're doing this so suddenly and without much explanation.
@_date: 2013-06-11 00:40:51
Yeah, took reading Xe.com's wikipedia article to convince myself they weren't associated with Blackwater (now no longer called Xe, either).

A 'break' in a signing algorithm is any way you can guess the key with less guesses than half the number of bits in the key size. Certain breaks by this definition aren't in themselves serious, in that brute force still isn't feasible, but make cryptographers nervous that bigger breaks are on the horizon. 
That said, I'm not aware of any such breaks against ECDSA, and I think it's telling that so many of the large CAs are starting to invest in selling SSL certs using it as the signing algorithm instead of RSA. 
@_date: 2013-07-28 05:34:22
Ooh, coupons to buy at 0.15 if you bought at the old price. 
@_date: 2013-07-13 20:30:00
Yeah, that's what's keeping me from using it. 
@_date: 2013-08-14 20:22:10
Is that true? Can you be required to lie directly, or just by omission? 
rsync.net, for example, publishes a weekly warrant canary message on the theory that if they receive a gag order, they can inform the public by stopping publication of the canary message.
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:21:58
What, elliptic curves aren't cool anymore? They're used for transaction messages, right? 
@_date: 2013-05-04 04:07:04
The fact that they entered into two mutually exclusive contracts does not make either void. It makes them liable for breach of contract to at least one party. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 20:48:08
I've looked but haven't found any smart cards on the market with the right algorithm. A few out there advertise ECC algorithms, but they don't say which curves they support (and Bitcoin needs a very specific one).
If you happen across something with PKCS support and the right algos, let me know!
@_date: 2013-07-28 18:13:36
Yup, read through the bottom of the original link. Says they're coming out with coupons "around August 5th."

So, anyone have the story of the Avalon fiasco (preferably in some format that doesn't require me to skip through hundreds of bitcointalk pages)? What were the delays? I've only been keeping up with the pitchfork mob surrounding BFL, and the occasionally angry mob surrounding ASICMINER.

Lorem ipsum on the front page is pretty beta, as is their FAQ. How functional is it? 
@_date: 2013-04-26 01:33:02
Just did a Dwolla transfer into CampBX and they shorted me by $0.25 - I sent $200.25 and they credited $199.75 (taking $0.50 instead of the $0.25 they usually do).
I opened a support case, waiting to hear back.
EDIT: They indicated they are manually processing deposits while a bug on Dwolla's side is resolved. They credited the difference back to my account.
@_date: 2013-09-07 04:47:12
4 blocks is already reaching the limit of believability on variance.
I have a suspicion that folks are holding capacity in check until the difficulty updates so they can get more blocks at a lower difficulty.
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:11:27
Love the site. They've been adding new features lately too (estimated dividend yield in history tab, others), which is nice. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 04:53:38
All good points. I'll just throw in one thing that I think is useful:
Publish a recommended method for researchers to disclose security events to your team, and give proper attribution for those that fix it.
There's been some research indicating that this is a good way to convince grey-hats to do responsible disclosure - make sure they know how to contact you, and that they'll get credit for their findings.

Still need to get it out of the country somehow, which I gather is the problem.
@_date: 2013-09-15 21:22:30
Hmm, that graph would be more useful with some time units on it.
@_date: 2013-07-28 18:20:09
So you can't have it both ways. I can build a small, offline device, cheaply and have it do bitcoin crypto, as long as I don't care about it having any certifications whatsoever. The certifications indicate, for example, that it's resistant to tampering, that the crypto implementation is correct (and resistant to a few known sidechannel attacks).
Buying a prototype and modifying it is great, and probably good enough for an individual. If you wanted to bring a product to market for, say, someone running an exchange's offline wallet, or a Bitcoin lending bank, then you probably are someone who carries insurance and want to be able to prove to your insurers that yes, you're taking precautions that have been vetted - and that means a certified product (CC EAL5+, FIPS 140-2, et al).
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find something that even supports the right crypto algorithms yet, which you might then be able to put something on top of to sign transactions. For all I know, the Trezor folks will pursue certification after they sell a few hundred thousand units, but it's not really worth the cost until they're really big (certification is expensive and time consuming).
@_date: 2013-07-18 01:24:33
Maybe thinking of Asiana?
