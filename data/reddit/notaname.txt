My claim stating my reasonably long previous password, name of the bank I deposited from, BTC balance (accurate +/- 2 coins) and USD balance was accepted.

You're getting downvoted because you don't seem to know about [variance](

Let's assume you want to sell bitcoins. You know that some people want to buy bitcoins and that he last price someone bought bitcoins for was, say, $5. This means that people seem to be willing to pay $5 for bitcoins. Since you want to maximize your profits, you could try to sell for more than $5. How much more? If you set the price relatively high, say $6, prospective buyers will buy from someone else (assuming there are other sellers). $6 is a 20% increase compared to the last price, and it's very likely that somebody else, who maybe bought a bitcoin for 5$ would be content with making a profit of 2% by selling it for $5.10.
Now if the price of a bitcoin was $100, the seller content with 2% profits would sell for $102, which is twice the increase in absolute terms, compared to when the price was $5.

Couldn't you simply argue that each birth is an independent event? That is, the probability of two parents getting a boy or a girl doesn't depend on the sex of their existing children, so the boy/girl ratio in the kingdom will stay at 50/50.
Another way to think about it is to imagine that all parents in the kingdom are numbered and get their children in sequence. Parents  toss a coin to determine the sex of their next child. If they get a girl, they get to keep tossing the coin for their next child, but if they get a boy, they pass the coin to parents  who do the same, and so on, until the coin has passed through all parents in the kingdom. The coin doesn't care how many boys or girls the parents tossing it have, it will always go 50/50.

Because the graph you posted simply shows variance in action.
SatoshiDice (and every other casino in one way or the other) basically offers you this proposition:


Obviously, no-one in his right mind would take that offer, so SatoshiDice could try a more deceptive proposition like:




Now if you have to give them 1 BTC nine times to finally get 9.81 BTC the tenth, that's still a pretty stupid and boring proposition. The key to making a good proposition is to add probabilities:




Now we're talking! If you take up this proposition you don't have to give them 1 BTC nine times in a row to finally get a return, it's now possible that you'll get 9.81 BTC on your first bet! And maybe you'll get another 9.81 BTC on your second bet, too, or even ten times in a row! It's possible!
With the second proposition, there is no random process involved, so the profit curve is just a repetition of a 10 up, 9.81 down pattern.
But because of the randomness in the 3rd proposition, there will be a lot of up- and downswings. The mathematical way of describing these swings is with a quantity known as "variance". Large variance means that you can expect big swings, small variance means that big swings will be rare.
Big swings are what gets customers excited into taking up the proposition, but to SatoshiDice, they don't really matter (provided they have sufficient funding and limit bet sizes). While some customers may win several times in a row, in the long run, they'll lose 90% of the time (because of the [Law of Large Numbers](
So, for SatoshiDice, proposition 2 and 3 are basically the same, but the variance in proposition 3 is what gets customers to take up a losing proposition.

So I buy BTC on mtgox, transfer it to the exchange with the biggest price difference, sell it there for a profit of a few percent, cash out fiat to my bank account, wait 1-2 days until the money arrives, then deposit it to mtgox, wait 1-2 days until the money gets there and start all over again.
Even assuming I can beat the fees, there's the much bigger problem that looking at the current BTC boom, whatever profit I made will pale in comparison to the amount BTC has gone up in those 2-4 days I waited for fiat transfers. Of course, BTC going down or just being stable would be a different story.
