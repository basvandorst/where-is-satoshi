I think you'll find that the general advice here is not to leave your BTC lying around in any online service.  Move it to offline storage and you're covered.

I'm in Ireland.
In theory, everybody could switch completely to barter, but in reality that's very impractical.  Imagine that you are a programmer, and your fridge is broken.  It's going to be a lot easier to accept cash for your skills and then go and buy a fridge, that it would be to find someone with a spare fridge who needs some programming done
So legally, anyone can swap pretty much anything for pretty much anything - but cash is king.
Most retail stores will only want cash as they don't want to build up a warehouse full of random products which they can't sell.  On the other hand, second-hand stores, charity stores etc might very well do so.
Similarly most stores won't accept currency other than Euro here, because they don't want the hassle and exchange rate risks.  However, close to the border with Northern Ireland, very many stores will accept British Sterling.  Just as stores just across the border in Northern Ireland will accept Euro.

Two problems with flipping bitcoin.
1.  Extracting your fiat takes a long time from any of the exchanges - something which has to change to promote any real general acceptance.
2.  The general pricing trend is a very steep climb upwards.  Sure, there are intermediate peaks and troughs.  You want to sell high and buy low.  If you don't get your timing exactly right, you stand to lose lots.

Interesting.  Does this only apply to the Euro? If I didn't have any cash, could the shopkeeper legally accept my watch as payment?
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:57:18
True, but there's a whole load of convenience yet to come.  BTC has a lot going for it, but online services may notbe as secure as banks, and paper wallets aren't as convenient as cash.

yes, but then I would effectively have invested/speculated with/gambled with my fiat currency.  Instead, I deliberately chose to invest the BTC.  BTC in / BTC out.  No currency exchange risk.  What I completely underestimated was the extent to which cloudhashing would fail to live up to their claims.


Which is why I chose the "stable" option, which turned out to be an utter crock.


Nope.  This investment left me down a few BTC.  That they happen to be worth more now than they were then is irrelevant to the investment, other than that it multiplies the scale of my loss in US$.

Investment was a little short of 2BTC.  Advertised return rate was within a range of 5-10 BTC.  Based on current performance, best likely return will be 0.5 BTC.
So a loss of 1.5 BTC on my original stake - or about 75%.  What makes it more infuriating is that I still get newsletters telling me how brilliant everything is - but no response to any direct contact.


Indeed.  Bitcoin isn't exactly all of my (modest) portfolio.
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:06:48
Given the current rate of growth, I could well make back the then dollar equivalent of the bitcoins I paid for this mess.  But I won't make back the value that those bitcoins would be worth if I had just kept them in my wallet.
In invested just short of 2 BTC in a scheme which promised to return 5-10 BTC in a year.  I'll be doing well to get 0.4 BTC back.
It's an expensive lesson, getting more expensive every day, but at least my other BTC are still there, and I add more every so often.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:48:46


This.  Or accept them for whatever you do for a living.

Yep.  That bus has left the station.

My guess at the time was that they were getting a flat fee and a percentage from me for the year which would mroe than cover their hardware costs, and that any residuals were theirs

How many mom and pop stores in your neighbourhood accept bitcoin?
**Edit:** How many [any kind of] stores in your neighbourhood accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:39:07
I'm seeing a many to many relationship there, maybe 4 or 5 typically on the left of the arrow, and dozens on the right.
When I click on an address on the left, I get a similar mapping, but this time it's one to many and the one is grayed out.  I guess this means it is fresh-ish?
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:14:01
I don't know anything about them, but I won't be investing in any mining from here on.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:54:15
But my gripe ws that it's not even returning (and can't) the advertised number of BTC.  
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:46:18
They're configured as BTC miners... don't fancy my chances of getting cloudhosting to reconfigure for anything else
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:55:35
I don't know enough to know.

isn't that just a way of losing a smaller amount of money?
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:27:36
OK, bad example, but without some serious further development (which I firmly believe is on the way), BTC loses the convenience comparison with cash.
mobile phone apps are a long way short of cash convenience.  The shop needs to be appropriately tooled up to process them, and most aren't, and only a tiny fraction of shops are, and many phones can't handle decent apps.
At best, from this perspective alone, a BTC app could be compared to a new widely-unaccepted credit card.  It'll get there, but right now, I can't go to my local shop and pay for my groceries with my BTC.
You could argue that this is an adoption issue.  That the shop manager could have a device running an app to accept my BTC, but without improvements in accessibility and security, adoption will be a slow burner.

If I pay with a watch, it's not a sale, it's barter and no sales tax applies.  
Have a look at [this World Bank study which refers to Croatia](

Apparently it hasn't.
People are getting more savvy about cold storage.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:47:32
I can't disagree.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:29:26


I don't see this happening.  Many people who are looking to bitcoin are doing so precisely to get away from central banks and government controlled currency.
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:27:12


Legally, yes.  However, store policy is probably never to do so.  Just as store policy in most shops is not to accept currency other than Euro.  But I'm not aware of any legal impediment that forces this.
@_date: 2013-11-14 10:07:49
It's due to a few things.  Here are a few off the top of my head.
Suppose that the store has a robust internet connection, QC scanner, something running an app to process the payment, and that all its staff 
are trained up.  Let's just assume all of that happens.
The big choice the store faces is whether to actually accept and process BTC or to run it through some third party which will take the BTC and give them dollars.
If they accept and process BTC, then they've got to into figuring out their storage strategy - what warm and cold stores to use, what solutions to use for each, how to easily move the BTC about, and ultimately what to do with all their BTC,  Will their suppliers or staff accept it for payment?  Or do they have to convert it back to $ to pay for stock, overheads or staff?  What if the value of BTC drops in the meantime, so that the dollar value of their BTC sales is less than the price of restocking the sold items?  All of this time, they have to maintain a multicurrency set of accounts and thereby complicate their office processes and tax returns.
On the other hand, if they use a service to wash the BTC into dollars so that they remain, at heart, a dollar business, then who is the currency speculator.  Suppose you go into a widget and buy a $30 widget for 0.1 BTC.  Suppose there's an issue with the widget and you go back the following day.  If the exchange rate is now 0.1 BTC = $40, how much do they pay you back?  Do they pay you back the $40 so that you get back the 0.1 BTC you paid (so they eat the speculation loss), or do they simply pay back the $30 they received, so that you eat the loss.  Or does whatever payment processing service they used take the $30 from them, and give you your 0.1 BTC back, so that they service provider eats the $10 loss?  Whichever way, someone's eating a $10 loss, and with the customer being the only one actually putting money into the system, it will be ultimately be the customer - whether that's case by case on each refund, or averaged over all sales to cover the cost of all refunds.  As a purchaser should you be made aware of who it's going to be, before you make your purchase?  While all the dollar customers wait in line behind you?
Should the store list dual prices in BTC and US$ for everything they sell, or just convert the total on checkout?  If you want to know the price of something, do you have to queue at the till so that the checkout operator can convert it at the store's exchange rate for you?  Or does the store need to invest in some additional price check scanners for you?
With the exception of figuring out the storage logicstics (whch raises the bar pretty high, as compared to simply using a bank) none of this is unique to BTC, by the way.  These are the sorts of issues that plague any business thinking of running multicurrency operations.  For reasons like this, most stores don't accept multiple currencies, unless there's significant volume to make the overheads and risks worthwhile.  So you may find stores near international borders or in highly touristed areas accepting multiple currencies, but it's not exactly widespread.
Running a store in multiple currencies is hard.  It's even harder when you have to be your own bank for one of them.
