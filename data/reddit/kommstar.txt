I think you would have more orphaned blocks if we went and changed block times. 10 minutes is just the average time, some blocks are less, some blocks are more.

Put a wallet on your phone, you won't need to download the whole blockchain and you will be able to send/receive bitcoins, start to see how your transactions move through the network.
Mycelium for Android
Blockchain for IPhone
@_date: 2014-10-29 20:09:54
With Armory you can create a transaction on an internet connected system which is then put on a usb stick and moved to the offline system so you can **sign** the transaction, which is then put back into the internet connected system for upload to the bitcoin network. It is pretty fancy stuff for home banking.
USB has faced some criticism lately and I think there are other methods of signing (qr code?), dvd-rw or cd-rw?.
With a paper wallet you would have to sweep the entire contents to a new wallet (unless you wish to reuse keys which is not recommended)
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:10:34
Same, I emailed Coinbase to let them know, you should too.
@_date: 2014-08-08 22:42:28
Good idea. The ability to transfer 'wealth' (items) from game to game would be beneficial for all users. If there ever becomes a way to trade BTC directly for items you would see the value of the game currency drop because of it's limited usage only in game, when you can have value outside the game.
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:13:20
@_date: 2014-10-29 20:41:00
You move the transaction in a file from the online system to the offline system. Unsigned file.txt becomes signedfile.txt after you sign it.
 I mentioned that USB has some issues so there are alternative methods of transferring the unsigned transaction (QR Codes is one)
@_date: 2014-10-29 23:09:43
Can you elaborate on how sidechains will be able to solve this issue?
@_date: 2014-10-30 01:16:11
I was under the impression that the reason for 10 minute confirm times was because of block propagation across the network. How would the side chain deal with this? If block propagation is not the issue then why else does bitcoin attempt to enforce 10 minute to hash attempts when other coins have varying times to new blocks? 
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:29:42

meh, start up BDP
@_date: 2014-08-08 22:23:22
Since your offices a geographically diverse and employees are probably paid in the local currency your company might be able to save some percentage on your payroll expenses by transferring money via bitcoin as opposed to the traditional banking routes. I am thinking the main bank account would convert to BTC, transfer to sub offices to convert back to other currency. (Maybe some employees would like to be paid in a percentage bitcoin) It may seem complicated but if your company can save 2% on an average salary of $50,000 then you are looking at $200,000 saved per year.
@_date: 2014-08-09 21:32:15

I think many people are investing for the long term. Block halving is right around the corner and once it's gone, it's gone, forever. Spend the 20 mil now, take the hit on expenditures but hold your BTC until your break even or make bank. People who are hooked into the fiat currency teet can do this all day long without breaking a sweat. The rest of us who actually have to work to get fiat do not have this luxury.... in the future economy I envision many mining associations where people will contribute investments to help secure and profit from the network while other large bitcoin businesses will have incentive to secure the network too (think bitcoin rewards programs, sidechain loan programs, property ownership management, etc.)

It is not controlled by anyone one entity. The costs associated with transacting via the traditional system are not entirely because "this is what we want to charge" but also because there are real costs associated with the way those businesses are run. There is property overhead (buildings, telecom wires, datacenters, employee parking lots, etc. etc.), marketing costs (ever see a credit card commercial?), energy costs, banking fees, employees, etc. etc. etc. Bitcoin has the advantage of removing all those costs and then putting the burden on the miners (who are reimbursed through inflation, although at a rate we all choose to accept.) It is my belief that the costs to run the traditional banking system cannot compete with cryptocurrencies (this is provable, though I don't have the data) and for this reason a more efficiency financial system is ahead of us.

No, a single address wallet is not derived from your seed. AFAIK there are two types of wallets, single address and HD. Seeds are used to create HD wallets.

Probably the cost of running a secure system with secure access from all possible clients would be enormous and very wasteful. With blockchain the security costs are outsourced and only securing the private key is necessary.

Derivatives and hypothecation of bitcoin is fine, giving bankers and politicians the the controls to the printing press is the real issue. (Which allows manipulation of derivative assets is not fine.)

One benefit of the trezor is that you can secure a bank account size of funds 1k+, and still remain mobile. (Cold wallets and air gapped systems are not as portable). There is still a place for those systems, but the trezor is a good middle ground.

I think the banks are looking at establishing intra-bank blockchains for trading bank assets. The idea is a bit absurd because you could implement the same functionality with global ledgers and let someone else pay for security and  validation.
You are right about the value of a global decentralized ledger with no access requirements though.

Without financial incentive distributed third parties will not be interested in securing the block chain. Without financial incentive the blockchain is merely a distributed linked list synced via p2p clients, these have existed for over a decade, maybe two

Get it updated for a trezor, more secure and it uses bip32 and bip44 standards.

Love the app, use it whenever I can. A dedicated app would certainly make the user experience a little more seamless and I think the authentication methods are limited and you should consider alternatives to twitter.

My trezor gives me my xpub key which I can read into mycelium and then mycelium knows all the public keys to generate to receive funds directly to the trezors private keys. I don't even need the trezor on hand unless I want to send btc from it's private keys.

Not such a bad thing. As we are able to interface with systems outside the banking world to move funds it only becomes easier to move into bitcoin. Imagine adding USD to shapeshift because now they had an iphone in house to move funds.

You have 2 offices each servicing a different currency. Remitter coverts USD to btc and when btc is confirmed, money can be disbursed in foreign country.
Obviously there are layers of un needed ineffciency here but the system has to start somewhere. Maybe replace office with a website.
The remittance companies can keep btc, or sell on an exchange to finance operation.
