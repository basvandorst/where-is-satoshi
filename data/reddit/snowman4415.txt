Can we cool it with training kids to put money into high risk investments and pretending it’s cool?

Who has the coins is completely irrelevant 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:59:20
Why don’t you enlighten us on the main points 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:51:57
It is decentralized.. the storage, the security model, everything is distributed. None of that is affected by “who” has coins and who doesn’t

Lol not sure how insider trading and bitcoin can be associated but ok
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:06:58
Truth. It’s more than just a belief too it’s an open market fact of life. Short term investment in any way shape or form is simply not a good investment strategy for most people, statistically. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:05:03
Yea that’s great and all but there is nothing wrong with having people create services to satisfy a free market economy. Not everyone is a mechanic, I still pay mine from time to time. The idea of everyone running their own full node is getting crazier every day no matter how ideal it may sound

Why does everyone hate circle again? It worked well last time I used it. Honestly curious

He’s obviously not a serious trader

Some people don't understand that we can't beat those systems without real scaling solutions. To hold a Visa amount of transactions, blocks would need to be far over 100mb which would introduce centralization anyway. Literally the only way we can get there is by layer 2+ solutions, and that is a fact

Or it's a comical way to highlight one of the many problems with BU as it currently stands?

That's what he said two posts above yours
@_date: 2016-09-09 20:54:53
 &gt;  are more often positive than negative
That's a horrible statistic 
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:21:35
I'll tell you why that's incorrect, and why zero percent of financial advisors, in general, advise their clients to "buy low, sell high, and repeat". (this goes for both stocks, crypto, whatever)
The answer is simply because you don't know when "low" is low and when "high" is high. If you sell "high" but it keeps going up, when do you buy back in? Or do you keep holding (gaining 0%) until it goes "low" again. There is no way to tell the future, the pricing of a security is based just as much on performance as market psychology. Even the best of the best professional investors (think Berkshire Hathaway and other hedge funds), statistically just barley beat market growth as a whole (s&amp;p 500, etc). So, if you were to buy and hold an index of the entire market, you would statistically do just a little bit worse than a seasoned investor. If you try and trade actively, you're basically gambling because you can't tell the future, and over time you will do worse than if you were to have just held onto a market index (assuming you are not a professional). I use the stock market as an example just because it's a well known example, but crypto markets operate the same way.
I'm not saying there is anything wrong with trading at your own risk, but thinking that you are "maximizing profits" using a strategy like that is naive. Remember that you are competing with everyone else who is doing the exact same thing. For every dollar won, someone else lost. If everyone is downright speculating with the same "buy low, sell high" mentality without pricing their assets against anything, you are literally just gambling against the next speculator.

Yea that’s when I sold everything 
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:24:23
Its naive to proclaim that everyone involved in bcash has a hidden agenda. It’s like proclaiming everyone that supports communism (or whatever, let’s not go there) has a hidden agenda.  There is usually a good mix of propagandists and people that legitimately think it’s a better system at all levels.
Not saying we should not call out the BS when we see it, but at least put it in the right scope.
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:59:55
Actually almost all professionals will tell you the opposite.

Taking McAfee seriously is the first mistake 
@_date: 2016-09-09 21:41:02
I agree with you but under the premise of a market correction the statistic loses ground doesn't it?
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:01:10
A real investor would tell you anything aside from the long term hold is nothing but gambling 
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:25:38
Yea, poorly phrased for sure

The real news here is a 6 year old able to conduct independent research and do her due diligence on the state of fiat currency markets and the applications of cryptography. Congrats dad!

I think the moral of the story is that everything is reliable until it isn’t and if it was such an easy game, everyone would do it and everyone would be making money but that’s simply not the case, nor can it be.
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:31:22
Lets be real. If you don’t understand blockchain technology, you probably aren’t fit to invest in blockchain companies. You will get swindled.
A lot of these companies don’t even fundamentally need blockchains to operate anyway. They are just layering standard proprietary technology on top of blockchain and calling it a revolution. It’s hilarious honestly.
@_date: 2019-09-09 21:06:42
Well clearly it’s worth 600 karma

Dude I'm only repeating what I heard in the interview, please watch the link I posted. I would call myself out on FUD if I got the chance 
@_date: 2017-05-07 07:46:09
I agree with you except under the assumption that he made which was if block sizes were too big and there became a situation where behind the GFOC created those conditions which is unlike the normal 51% attack
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:16:15
Your misunderstanding what I said. Less hash power and behind the GFWOC is what the question and answer was about, I was merely relaying that to you. Asking this question means you didn't see the link I posted.
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:51:51
Oops, thanks
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:46:58
Clearly an oversight, I'm not sure any real protocol developer would ever advocate for such a thing 
@_date: 2017-05-07 09:09:25
Because it's behind the GFWOC and could potentially be pulled off by less hash power, listen to the question and answer. It's a hypothetical drawn out by Ver. That's not the point though. The point is his attitude toward the fact that the only thing stopping the attack is market instability and NOT economic incentive. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:23:11
True but to be fair there is zero theoretical reason to avoid a 2-4x increase at this very moment. It needs to be dealt with and quickly
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:41:21
I think people are misunderstanding your question. The answer is that a bitcoin can be divisible to as small as .000000001 units so no matter what the cost of a bitcoin is, the miners will still be willing to accept the market rate (in fiat) and the fees will be able to represent that cost. Yes the block reward will eventually go away in the distant future but once the block size increases (it will), the tx fees will continue to sustain the miners.
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:53:37
This post is a joke fyi 
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:17:29
Awfully pessimistic view... anyway, people have to remember that a 51 attack, while theoretically powerful, will be spotted quickly and damage mitigated. Is it worth the collapse in reputation of the companies involved? Probably not
