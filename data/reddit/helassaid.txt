I'm so glad ELS is there to fight the social justice fight.

*"Oh, king eh? Very nice. And how'd you get that, eh? By exploiting the workers. By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society."*

You're of the opinion that without a government, nobody would build a road to anywhere and no commerce would ever happen?
Let's start at the beginning:  What defines a road?  Macadam with demarcated lines?  What about concrete, brick, or cobblestone?  Does a road really *need* to be a paved surface?  Many "roads" in Rome were just packed dirt - hell roads in most major cities in the United States were just packed dirt less than 150 years ago.
Did Lewis &amp; Clark take US 66 on their expedition?  Were the Wells Fargo coaches issued EZ-Pass?  How did *anyone* make it to Salt Lake City before there was a *road* to Salt Lake City?
Your supposition that only a government can build a road is preposterous.  The government doesn't even build the roads in the first place.

Damn.  Your logic is perfect.
*Pack it in, boys, we need roads, and the only way to get them is through a huge regulatory machine and continuous intrusions into our personal lives.*

Imagine a scenario where the public waste provider increases prices by 10,000% citing decreased tax revenue.  Its exactly the same situation, only there is *less* option for recourse.
