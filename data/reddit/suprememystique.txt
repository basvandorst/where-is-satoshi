Can I send from my non-segwit wallet to a segwit wallet (one that starts with m)?
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:19:30
So they still did not link?
BTW, how long did it take to fund, buy crypto, and then send the bitcoin out?
Would this be possible within a day?
@_date: 2019-09-04 00:14:46
Apparently, that's a mobile app which is not preferrable for me.
What do you think about localbitcoin or other exchanges?
Can those get me bitcoin fast?
What if I want litecoin, does that take a week to set up too?
@_date: 2019-09-04 03:30:57
Can I  ask you questions
I'm hearing different things about coinbase.
I thought it took just a few minutes because that's what I read on the site but apparently, it can take up to a week.
I'm in Canada but on the coinbase site it says


So apparently it's instant to get bitcoin.


For US customers, Coinbase uses the ACH bank transfer system for payments with your bank account. The ACH bank transfer system typically takes 3-5 business days to complete after initiating a purchase
So which is it?
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:48:19
why? is electrum ltc unreliable?
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:41:46
Okay, last question
What's the difference between funding and just buying directly with credit card?
Why even fund if you can just directly buy with credit/debit card?
Which is the best method?
@_date: 2019-09-03 22:07:33
As a new user, how long does it take to get everything running?
So I open a bitcoin account on coinbase, will I be able to immediately buy coins and send them to an intermediary wallet? 
Also, do exchanges coinbase require me to give them my ID if I want to set up an account?
@_date: 2019-09-07 05:23:03


Yes, but would he have to pay tax for the $1000 profit that I made? Or only the subsequent profit that is made after that he accrues himself.
In other words, does anybody pay tax for that specific $1000 profit that was made?
@_date: 2019-09-03 23:40:17
Holy shit, a week? Is there any other way to get straight in to purchasing bitcoin and moving it in to a wallet?
@_date: 2019-09-03 23:38:44


You mean bitcoin is primed to take off again?
Also, the other user here said it takes a week to set up, any faster way of doing this?
@_date: 2019-09-04 03:50:48
Cash app isn't available in Canada.
I'm going to sound like an idiot here but I figured you'd just buy instantly from credit card. What is the 3-5 day ach transfer?
So, it takes 3-5 days to deposit the money in to coinbase account. But the purchases of the bitcoin is instant?


Why not, what do you use for coinbase then?
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:05:34
Do I pay less in transaction fees if I move my bitcoin to an intermediary wallet?
@_date: 2019-09-08 22:50:30
Need help, this is my first time trying to transfer from exchange (coinberry) to electrum-ltc. 
I put my recieving address in the address and it says 
"This does not look like a valid LTC wallet address."
What do I do?
My electrum ltc wallet says [standard]
@_date: 2019-09-03 03:07:06
My sarcasm detector is going off here.
@_date: 2019-09-05 19:21:08
Need help with coinberry. I tried linking my bank account yesterday, it said it should take 10 minutes but nothing happened.
I've called, email them and zero response. 
What the hell do I do?
Can I atleast add funds with interac?
Or does that require my bank account to be linked
I did verify my account with my cell phone.
Maybe this is a cookie/browser issue?
@_date: 2019-09-05 20:08:46
Dude you don't know how happy I am to get an answer on this. I've been emailing, phoning them constantly for the past day or so, they are not responding.
So did you eventually link it?
Do you know why it says it will link in 10 minutes but doesn't? Did you have to do it via phone or did you just have to wait a couple of days? Am I supposed to wait or did I do something wrong?
I think I might go ahead an e-transfer
@_date: 2019-09-03 23:33:48


Like how much more? If you had to guess percent wise, how much would it be for each method?
@_date: 2019-09-04 01:49:48
Is it possible to send them to an intermediary wallet from the cashapp?
Anyway to use cashapp on PC?
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:54:38
Google is super late and unreliable.
What's the most up to date bitcoin currency converter
@_date: 2019-09-03 03:00:42
Why did you need a cashapp account, can't you just buy it with a credit card on the exchanges?
@_date: 2019-09-09 00:52:55
Ya I fixed this by making a new electrum wallet and setting to legacy which works when withdrawing from exchange
My only concern now is that when I send to other users now , it will be incompatible. Do you think this will be problem. Or will be able to send to others?
@_date: 2019-09-03 22:10:25
I see, thanks.
I read somewhere that I get to adjust transaction fees if I move my ltc to an intermediary account?
What does this mean?
@_date: 2019-09-03 02:02:40
Is it a good time to buy bitcoin? I know nothing about this stuff sorry, complete noob. Or should I wait? 
I heard someone says says it's primed to buy again a few months ago.
@_date: 2019-09-07 01:41:12
If I buy for $1000 and it goes up to $2000, I make a profit of $1000 CAD (live in Canada). Let's say I send that $2000 btc to a friend as a gift. 
Who pays for the tax on that?
Is there any tax to pay?
If so, how can I avoid taxes with btc?
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:57:54
What if I wanted to just make one-off quick transaction right now? I currently have zero coins and want to buy something from someone who only takes bitcoin
Do exchanges like coinbase get hacked often?
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:36:16
Hi, I'm a complete noob and I have questions.
When you buy bitcoin/litecoin off the exchange, it goes in to your exchnage wallet (eg coinbase). Why do you have to transfer it to another wallet like electrum?
Why can't you just buy stuff or send bitcoin/litecoin to people from coinbase?
@_date: 2019-09-04 01:14:37
Which exchange can allow me to have an account set up and have access to bitcoin immediately? 
I've never used bitcoin, I'd rather not wait a week to set up an account on coinbase.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:48:10
Is it going to stabilize soon?
@_date: 2019-09-04 01:02:35
Okay but does every exchange take a week?
