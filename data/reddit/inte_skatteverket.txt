Lot's of people in west are in huge debts, they don't own their fancy house, they don't own their fancy car, they don't even own their fancy phone or flat screen LED TV. They're only renting it. Compare to any "poor" country where people isn't in debt. 
They may live in a shitty house, own a shitty car, a shitty old phone and a shitty old CRT TV but at least it's theirs and during the next financial crisis they won't loose any of their stuff while lot's of "rich" people in west are going to become homeless and loose all the fancy stuff they have.

I'm not criticizing debt, I'm criticizing the incorrect statement that someone with unmanageable debt is considered rich while someone who did pay all their basic wealth with their own money is considered poor when it should be the opposite. Even if the person is unmanageable debt may look richer because they have temporary access to nicer things.

Some people tend to get upset when they can't find the post history in order to judge someone based on their past.

Well Bitcoin is a threat towards corrupt governments just like it's a threat to corrupt banks. Why use a shitty currency when there's crypto currencies that doesn't require banks or oppressive governments to work.
