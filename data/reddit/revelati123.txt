Wealth has more baked in advantages than anyone can count. It takes a genius to make a poor man rich, it takes just "not being an idiot" to stay that way.

I currently am owed over 100k from a company that went bankrupt, I spent even more money on lawyers and trials and 2+ year of BS. I have a signed court order saying that whatever assets the company has are mine and there is one only one creditor ahead of me.
Too bad that creditor was a major bank...
So a multi-billion dollar transnational corporation gets about 80% of their investment back. Everyone else gets jack shit.
At least in crypto its still so wild west that some scraps fall out of the whales mouth from time to time for us little fish to get. With stocks and banks, raping the little guy is baked into the laws of the land.

From what I understand, there were two options, one for BTC returned, one for payout in fiat at then market prices.
Of course since most people were reeling from the losses caused by the crash they took the fiat option. And there are no backsies.

Investors tend to pump whatever position makes them money, I mostly cashed out, so bring on the bear market! The more bad press the better as long as the fundamentals are good, it just means a bigger upward correction later.

This story dropped about 4 hours after my comment.
Fairly anonymous means I can mine ZEC in my basement convert it to LTC and send it anywhere in the world without using any real identification.
If you used real IDs to get on fiat exchanges then obviously your ID is out there. And in theory, depending on how you convert your coins and where, your coins could hypothetically be tracked.
Bottom line, IF you get your coin from coinbase or a big fiat exchange, it is TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE to trace that transaction.
Im sure if they sick the NSA on you and spend 50 or 100 million on a full bore multinational investigation they can get you.
Fairly Anonymous also means the cost of tracking individual transactions across millions of users is far higher than the resources of any law enforcement agency that gives a shit.
Im just explaining to you the rational of the market, they DO take LTC over Monero, and their REASONS ARE that they like its liquidity more than hey care about privacy, and they ARE NOT getting busted in numbers to make anyone care enough to switch at this point.
If you think the Darknet is doing it wrong, you should take it up with them.

Im not sure everything in the world happens because of crypto.
You are talking about manipulating a market worth many trillions to manipulate a market worth ~500 billion.
I think it has more to do with big players locking in profits after a long bull run.

Parties were not conceptualized in the constitution, the thought was that politicians would represent their constituents.
IE. The voters in your district or state, would be the "party" that you represent, and in that context first past the pole makes great sense.
In our current system, the first past the pole basically enforces the 2 party system, but it was certainly never meant for that purpose.

No one "risked the note ban" thats idiotic. Its not like a scarcity of hundred dollar bills makes them worth more than a hundred dollars, as long as there are enough 20s and 50s to go around.
It was all a ploy to get people to deposit their money, anyone who didnt deposit in time just didnt know any better.

Many on the darknet moved to litecoin when BTC fees spiked. Most there just want something with fast and cheap transaction speeds but are scared of taking coins with low market cap that can be hard to cash out for fiat.
Since wallets and exchanges are still fairly anonymous they havnt really worried so much about coins with special privacy features. 
But as the markets settles out and clear winners are established I would guess they will move to something like Monero, ZEC, or Bitcoin private.

Memes get lots of discussion about how stupid they are driving up karma begetting new memes so people click on them to comment on how stupid they are, then more people comment on how stupid it is to comment on stupid memes if you think they are stupid because it just drives more clicks on the memes, which as a discussion drives more clicks on the memes.
Its the circle of meme life.

Hate to get metaphysical on you, but if there weren't any humans, who would be around to give a shit if nature was all happy about it?
Then when some giant meteor strikes earth and wipes out all life anyway, at least we could have colonized another planet and remembered how nice it was.
But anyway, GO BITCOIN!
