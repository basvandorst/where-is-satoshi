If you’re trying to start mining for the first time in 2019 it’s almost never worth it money wise.

You are competing against literal warehouses dedicated to mining bitcoin. If an $85 purchase was all you needed to make a profit from mining, everyone would do it. The only way I would recommend it is if it’s a hobby type of thing.
Edit: you would be better off just buying $85 dollars with of bitcoin

But admittedly it’s still over my head to an extent
