Unfortunately the fees right now are going completely over the roof:
To get confirmed within the next block you would need to pay 800 satoshis/byte. 
Your two transactions together pay 507 sathoshis/byte.
However your transaction(s) should probably confirm within the next 14 hours, assuming the transaction fees do not start to pile up even more.
As an advice: Try to use RBF instead of CPFP if possible, and also switch to Segwit to save on paying transaction fees.

Good question! I just felt that something like this was missing. To begin with I will just keep on posting links that I find interesting and maybe other people will visit the site just because of that. With time hopefully other people will also start posting.

Yes I am planning on also keeping the list updated myself. But the idea is that anyone can post links but that the community will only upvote relevant posts (similar to how  does it). I have added links as I see would be perfectly on topic for this page. I hope that the minimalistic design and simple functionality of the page will keep it on focus and repel the "wars" known from social media.

It's running on a VPS at the moment and it is not the most beefy. But loading time shouldn't actually be too bad after having tested it in different locations.

I just checked out the Chrome App and Android App of Ninki Wallet. I really like the experience! Especially the idea behind adding contacts and sending them bitcoins without "directly" knowing their bitcoin addresses. 
But I was thinking if you have considered using OneName or Namecoin to circumvent the necessity of exchanging a fingerprint. For example to create an account at Ninki you would need the same username to create an account at OneName/Namecoin and then the fingerprint would be put into the Namecoin Blockchain. Then the Ninki Wallet could just receive the fingerprint by looking at the Namecoin Blockchain and thereby validate that it received the correct deterministic bitcoin addresses from the Ninki servers associated to that username.
