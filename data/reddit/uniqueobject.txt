i guess the deflationary policy is one aspect that makes this system appealing, beside many more facts of BTC we all know. but what i was questioning was more if the current distribution of BTC will impact its mass adoption? Because you will always have the fear, that those holders can manipulate the value and therefore are not different than a central government. mnnnnn?

Thanks for your input - It makes sense what you are saying, but in the end it counts how a system is developing over time - therefore, i am still sceptical about the centralization issue about holdings. 
I have 75% of my crypto investments in BTC, but learning more I also question more ;-)

Thanks for your input, and I agree with your point, but it would be interesting to see how much of the bitcoin distribution actually moved over time. saying this, if we had this inequality for years, than it just means that the distribution is centralized and does not depend much on the exchange of BTC that we see right now.

I am not paid for it, i just read an article about it. I have 75% of my crypto investments in BTC, but learning more I also question more ;-)

good point, so you are saying, that the distribution chart of the image i posed  might include holdings of the exchanges and therefore you have this super in-equal distribution? 
Thanks, I didn't think about this  ;-)
