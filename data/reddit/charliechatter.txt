Then you can't invest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:27:50
Ahh well...let's give up then and not attempt to expose this by posting ALL forms, processes and money needed in each state.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:53:31
Let's make this a 1-2-3 step process all out in the open.
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:08:12
You need to stop.  You are gambling with your livelihood brother.  STOP.
You are spending way more than you can afford to lose.  
Do what you have to do to survive for a few months--stay away from bitcoin.  You can NEVER count on an investment to double--EVER.
If you can't take this advice, YOU HAVE A GAMBLING PROBLEM and must admit it to yourself.

Bitcoin will cause businesses and those holding bitcoin to be FAR more accountable.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:30:14
It really doesn't matter what any government thinks of bitcoin or any decentralized currency.  They are here to stay.  Fuck the police.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:08:39
Also, I guarantee you as the price moves up, many of these people will cash out to hedge their bets.
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:15:09
YOU'RE NOT FUCKING LISTENING.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:07:59
It really doesn't matter.  I actually think it's very healthy in a bitcoin only world. 
Think about this, if there is no one printing new money, people that own a lot of bitcoin will either have to never spend any (impossible) or provide real services and goods to humanity to hold onto what they have.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:37:56
The safest way to use Bitcoin is by using different numbers with each transaction.  This makes it best NOT to get any one number or mark on your forehead or right hand.
In the battle of crazy vs. crazy, that's the best I could come up with.
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:10:47
I think the community should try to accumulate this information so any challenge to folks being money transmitters can be swiftly dealt with.
Wouldn't it be something if we could make a website that automated it and let you know if you had your i's dotted and t's crossed and then officially approved of this before you submitted the paperwork. 
This way the govt would have to challenge the verification code on the website or at least they would know it couldn't be so easily dismissed.
This is a more organized approach.

It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter who owns how many bitcoins.  With bitcoins, you can't print more.  As they are used, that's it.  In a bitcoin world, you have to provide goods and services to your fellow man or you will run out of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:32:14
In order for YOU to get any money out of it, just sell it.
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:36:07
The point you're missing is the .01 percent never pay for money.  They literally get free loans.  Look into it if you don't believe me.
This is impossible in a bitcoin world.  NO ONE can just print more money to recover losses.
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:11:10
Let's not let the govt get away with stopping something by creating vague rules that can never be followed.
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:17:54
LMFAO!  Ok dude... I think it's going to double tonight.  Go pawn all your shit and put your sister on the street.  How much do you want for that bitch?  Does she suck a mean cock or what dude?
Seriously it's going to double again after the doubling tomorrow in exactly one week.
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:28:58
Should we just pick one state with the fewest/cheapest requirements and host a ton of exchanges there?
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:12:10
You NEED to stop FEELING.
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:08:31
We need a website with all the paperwork ready to be filled out in a a programmatic guided fashion.  The community should create this.  
Let Fincen challenge this website instead of the individual businesses.  
Do they want to help or just get in the fucking way?
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:20:11
You should sue Max Keiser man.  Hold his ass accountable for giving bad advice.  Max Keiser is ruining your life.

Certain washing machines and dryers now allow you to pay in bitcoin.  Take your dirty clothes to laundromats that support this and pay in btc.  Make sure you bring your own detergent as many times these laundromats support bitcon for the washers but not the detergent dispensing machines.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:29:08
What you have discovered is you know NOTHING of investing and NOTHING of patience.  
Your take away should be NEVER part with your rent money and make sure you believe in something before you invest.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:25:12
Like Warren Buffet's rich friend said, "Bitcoin is rat poison."  He was right.  Bitcoin is rat poison if you're a rat.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:25:24
That is still far, far better than some unknown group printing money at their discretion and being in total control of the money supply.
Investing in successful companies is the same thing as providing a good or service to humanity.  What do you think the company is doing?  Unlike the current .01 percent (notice I did not say 1%), in a bitcoin only world, you can't just have your good buddy at the bank make your loan disappear by filing for bankruptcy.  Bad investments will come out of YOUR pocket.

Honestly Wikipedia is too status quo now.  They use to represent the new Internet.  Now they represent the old Internet.  It really is time for a new online encyclopedia--perhaps a decentralized one.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:20:41
Meet me somewhere and I'll mug you this way if you like it so much.
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:22:25
It's doubling tomorrow man.  Don't worry.  Put all your money into it.  Is your mother a hooker too.  I'll give you some money if you let your mom and sis suck on my nuts.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:23:25
Do us all a favor and come back here in one year ok.  I want you to remember just how fucking stupid and panicky you are.
You sir are NOT and investor.  You are a gambler and a TERRIBLE one.  Now quit being a cry baby.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:27:42
Do you think maybe if it goes down a lot that might be the time to get in and just wait NOT when it's near a peak?
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:12:41
I hope your family doesn't let you make decisions for them. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:21:05
No one will...AHHHH...holy shit, you've uncovered the fatal flaw.  Ahhhh!!  Everyone sell your bitcoins now!!!
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:13:07
Also, I would bet if you add up all the folks behind the central banks of the world that number is far less than 927.  Think of the money AND control of money they have.
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:39:03
So many questions are tainted with "Bitcoin sucks, now tell me why I should take it seriously?" 
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:35:12
I'm a bitcoin optimist but folks need to be aware this is happening.  
You'll never find a source but look at the similarity of strategies.  
1) Absurd qualifications for starting an exchange.
2) Legal attacks against money transmitters--spreading fear.
3) Individual banks made so afraid of bitcoin they close accounts
4) Insane monetary requirements to start an exchange
5) Vague laws and requirements
This is just a short list off the top of my head.  They will get away with whatever they can in their own countries.  China is obviously the worst.
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:03:52
Forget making them unless you're willing to put in 20k+.  Buy them if you believe the value will go up or if you would like to send money to someone.
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:24:49
What exactly are you trying to do here?  If this is promotional, it's very stupid to put that in as the heading.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:22:20
In a bitcoin only world, you couldn't hold onto it. You'd have to spend it as you must eat and live.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:35:52
I just checked mine and it was like combing the desert.
