"Only the rich are up for losses." Is this a good thing? To see those "evil" rich people lose most of what they have? Sure, some rich people don't deserve their wealth, but the majority of those rich people are regular hard-working, taxpaying citizens. I do not understand this toxic mindset of "if I can't have it nobody can!"

A doctor is paid well, because being a doctor is exceptionally difficult. They go through years of intense studying and training, and after that the lives of hundreds of people lay in their hand. If doctors weren't paid a lot more than low level accountants, barely anybody would want that job. Certainly not the most ambitious people. There definately are immoral bankers, but you are missing my point. Not all rich people are immoral,  in fact most of them aren't. I hate to see this tribalistic Us vs Them mentality.

You pay badly you get someone not as good. That sounds like "tough luck if you are poor and cannot afford." What about people who are truly poor? They would not be able to afford any doctors at all, or just a monkey with a stethoscope. This does not sound better than the current situation. Snakeoil treatments would also become rampant again.

I do not see how your free market is better than what currently exists in alot of countries. Where I live every citizen has acces to medical care, regardless of wealth. When done correctly, a society can greatly outscore the free market you envision in terms of acces to treatment. The medical system isn't denying people acces to medicine, beaurocratic incompetence is (in most countries).
