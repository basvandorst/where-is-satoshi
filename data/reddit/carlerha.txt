Back in 2011 I mined initially on my macbook, then the difficulty made it useless. Switched over to gpu, had it running for a few weeks. Ended up with around 60 BTC before a single graphics card too became less useful. Then Mt Gox and Tradehill came around. Rest is history.

Funny thing is how any physical location in particular is going to be the "center" of a DEcentralized system

Why is this self promoting, non-Bitcoin shit in my Bitcoin feed? And why does it get upvoted? This type of post was cool back in 2011 when Bitcoin was unknown and any PR was good, but imo should be banned from in the present day.

"Though a cryptocurrency bull market *isn’t necessarily* underway, the worst of the pain *could* be *largely* over."
Way to caveat yourself out of making an actual prediction.

Granted that OP has told us everything and is not lying and has a sturdy lock box, I think it's most likely that someone figured out his PIN and borrowed his Trezor. That's the occam's razor explanation

Monopoly is when the government grants a single organization right to act in a market while prohibiting others from competing.

For a total tax level of 70-80% one would demand the items on your list as a bare minimum. Whether your claims are actually true can be discussed (i.e. that the health care is in fact decent, the education in fact good, etc).
And that leaves aside completely the more important question as to whether or not it's morally permissible for a majority group of people to force their ideas of how society should be organized down other people's throat at the point of a gun demanding everyone else pay for it.

Maybe true. Nonetheless, I'm earning passive income as we speak by staking coins on certain platforms.

Thanks for sharing. I would like to point out that even though altcoins might drop more in price in bear markets and don't make a great hedge, some of them enable dividend payouts from staking. Thus they don't necessarily need to be non-correlated to, or outperform, Bitcoin's price to be reasonable long-term investments (assuming they survive long term ofc.)
