Yeah, someone with that much bitcoin must be a real dummy. /s
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:25:15
What the hell does "taking reality at face value" even mean.
The reality is, both Satoshi Nakamoto and Dorian Nakamoto deny being each other. And lacking any evidence, no other outcomes can be proven at this point.

What was the date of this conversation?
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:54:40
I'm glad you are making light of and wasting the resources of people that have lost a huge amount of bitcoin and dollars.

NFC hasn't been and won't be useful until Apple implements a payment system.

Is it also too convenient that the friend is actually the site admin and is probably online a lot of the time?
@_date: 2014-01-29 02:38:09
No. It's a base58-encoded *hash* of a public key. Look it up.

Wait, where does it say they have filed for bankruptcy?
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:23:09
These are all the addresses that hadn't been touched before silk road...
So here's a theory on what happened: Investigators tracking the silk road coins found that a lot of bitcoins went to Mt. Gox, so they issued a gag order and began investigating. They locked up all withdrawals. Mt. Gox is under pressure from both sides; customers trying to get their money out, and investigators that don't want any more "drug money" to leak. So they file for bankruptcy protection, the assigned judge is briefed on their pending legal investigation and grants them protection. But because these address were around before silk road, it can be proven the coins have no link to silk road. They have no reason to keep holding them, so the investigators allow a select subset of Mt. Gox's real bitcoin holdings to be released.

That's like... 0.02 BTC or $10 USD

A shoebox that size isn't that crazy.

What do you do?
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:27:05
I could not find my non-zero balance account.
I could not find my user id, nor could I find my balance. I have screenshots of my balance prior to mtgox going down, and I have a password recovery email that has a user id.

I can't believe people still actually think Karpeles is trying to run away with the coins.
@_date: 2016-01-09 23:34:38
But you think bitcoin.org isn't?

It's very relevant discussion to users who might want to use Bitcoin Classic over Bitcoin Core.

What do you think Bitcoin is?
Bitcoin is the currency with the most hashing power. The currency with the most hashing power is the one with the most investment in its future, the one with the most at stake for its success.
So if you don't like some feature the rest of the hashing power agrees upon, they aren't creating an alt coin, you are.

I had to check to see if I was browsing @_date: 2012-11-25 07:03:25
I agree. I'd type it fast a few times into notepad and just see what my most common typos for that passphrase is.

Here's an easier calculation that's just as accurate:
Total number of USD / Total number of BTC
1.18 trillion / 21 million
$56,190.48 per BTC
The question is, can and will bitcoin usurp the USD?

What? Cold storage has always been a thing. Generating private keys offline isn't a new or novel thing... That's JustSomeBadAdvice.

Brainwallets and cold wallets also help. You can't prove someone owns an address if it's not in their wallet.

Because I'd bet that most erroneous transactions where the sender made a mistake were because the sender was manually creating or using bitcoind to create the transaction.
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:00:37
I wouldn't be surprised if some implementations lower the priority of 1dice transactions. The only time I played satoshi dice it took 3 blocks before my transaction had it's first confirmation.

The last time someone came onto this subreddit and started giving away bitcoins the price crashed. Just saying...
@_date: 2013-09-06 23:16:42
You are kind of right. The seller(s), who were about to sell off a large amount of bitcoin, wanted to maximise the value they could sell at. So they started tipping a few hundred dollars of btc here and there, causing a frenzy that reinforced the value. So when they sold, they were in a much better position than if they had just shocked the market.
EDIT: Look what happened not long after you posted that!
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:05:42
I know you can get lag info from other places, my point was that it should be displayed on a status page.
Btw, I prefer 
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:53:07
I believe 
a) As more people get bitcoin we will see an increase in liquidity which will stabilize the price. Other things that will increase liquidity: new/stronger/faster exchanges, institutional investors, and improvements to ease of use.
b) If I answered that, your next question would be "how do you know?" and I couldn't answer that.
c) As stable as any other currency. Look at any currency pair over the last 5 years. With steady deflation, obviously it can't stay on parity with inflationary fiat.

It's not too often that single block forks are created. Single block forks are to be expected and this page will show you them, as well as more serious, longer, forks.

I have always preferred [clarkmoody's charts]( over bitcoinity because candlestick charts show you opening, high, low and closing value per time unit. Clarkmoody also has finer time resolution, which is always nice.
But this visualisation is much easier to read than candlesticks. I might use bitcoinity as my default for a while and if I don't miss the 1m resolution I might just switch.
@_date: 2013-08-12 23:43:22
What are you talking about?

First, thanks for doing an AMA. It will hopefully clear up a lot of fear/hate surrounding Mt. Gox.
Secondly, please create a proper status page on a good CDN... heck use twitter/facebook if you must, but it needs to show three things:
- Engine Lag
- Market Status (open or closed)
- Upcoming planned outages with timestamps

Open bitcoin-qt and click _Help -&gt; Debug Window_ click on the _Console_ tab and type
    importprivkey &lt;your private key here&gt;
And hit enter. The address (and it's funds) should now be in your wallet.

It assumes that the network is in working order. That is, that nobody is working on blocks that are not the highest.
I'm working on an update that will check to see if any new blocks that have recently been created are lower than the highest, which would indicate that something buggy is going on (in the case of the 0.7/0.8 bug, clients not accepting a block because of it's size).
@_date: 2013-03-18 09:53:39
Also! You can check if there's a fork for any block height, just like this: [istheblockchainforked.com/225430](
