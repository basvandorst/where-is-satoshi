So what is the status of your money? If they have frozen your account, have they essentially stolen your coins?

You are the perfect foil to liberty. Well done, sir.
How dare those uppity peasants try to escape your command-and-control central banking and currency!

We are discussing "them" as if they are a unified group. Do we know that to be the case?
I agree that it was probably an inside job, but that does not mean that the top guy did it, or even knew about it.
Of course the leadership must be held accountable, but it could very well be lower-tier staff that actually stole the bitcoins.

Why do the "good guys" insist on putting a boot on my neck, and a gun to my head?
I am tired of being told to "submit and obey." Worst of all is when they claim to do it "for my own good." I'll take my own chances without your help; thank you very much.

When will they give permission to breathe and eat? Or am I grandfathered in on those privileges?
Perhaps I can apply for a license and pay a fee...

Some people might call that a false dichotomy. Or they might seek a happy medium between your extremes.
But not you. You are the embodiment of demagoguery. Again I say: "Well done!"
Shall we round up the rebels and have them exterminated, sir?

That is exactly what I am worried about. Regardless of their status as currency, a thing of real value was lost/stolen/misappropriated.
However, by ignoring the situation, the Justice Department can effectively deny legal protection to Bitcoin holders, and effectively deprecate their value.
Bitcoin holders become a sort of second-class citizen, who can be ripped-off without consequence. Karpeles should have been in jail long ago, but the Justice Department is setting a precedent for permitting theft, because they either don't understand, or because they actively wish to diminish the rights of people who use a competing currency to the dollar.

Utuxia already clarified his comment to mean not to download programs from hacker sites. 
And yes, trusted sources make all the difference.

Quite the reverse; the regulations are meant to stifle the bitcoin phenomena, and force it to behave the same as other regulated financial instruments.
The intention is to destroy, not to improve.

That's just what we need: a proprietary protocol and a nice crusty layer of DRM to obscure and hijack an open standard.

I didn't see any discussion about enforcement in the original post.
How do they plan to ensure compliance? Regardless of whether these regulatory suggestions are a good idea, it will take force to compel obedience.
Will they demand regular compliance audits?
Will they seize assets of people who don't turn in their paperwork?
Will they imprison people for failing to submit to these regulations?
The prospect is not merely a few reform-minded suggestions, but the use of violence to punish everyone who does not submit.

Or PayPal will ruin Bitcoin's reputation and usher it into obscurity.
Partnering with criminal scum like PayPal cannot help anyone.

I have hundreds of programs on my computer, all downloaded.
How else would I get software?

Wow. Interesting perspective on inter-generational debt: "He got what he expected to give to his grandchildren."
I think of it as the older generation consuming all the wealth and leaving a legacy of debt slavery.

When are we going to hard fork to strip the $600 million that Mark Karpelès of MtGox stole?

Are there no bitcoin wallets in the App Store? I tried looking for one the other day, but I didn't find what I wanted...
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:39:06
Reviews say to Google 'Zhou Tong.' They claim the developer stole Bitcoins from them. That is the worst recommendation possible for a bitcoin wallet. 
I knew none of this 2 minutes ago. Did you?
