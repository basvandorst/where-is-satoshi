This still does not solve the problem. So the seller refuses to release the escrow, the buyer has paid, then what happens? Who is liable for compensating the buyer? Hodl hodl??
The seller may not even need to be a fraud. What if the seller died during the transaction? This is the part that you are yet to explain and is not clear how your solution is fool proof

So loss of reputation is the only punitive measure against a seller who can simply relist under a different handle since there is no KYC/AML. This is very unsafe!!! and not secure for the buyer in anyway. 
Why would someone do this?? Cause there is no cost to an attack. An attack is costless. Second the attacker knowing that you cannot compensate your buyers will simply do this with purpose of crashing the platform reputation - a coordinated attack from several sellers doing this to unsuspecting buyers and then hodl hodl earns a bad reputation and you done. Platform deserted. There is a reason why attacks are designed to come with cost. To disincentive attacks. Your protocol has zero disincentive. Seller gets his money in the end whether the trade happened or not.  The risks that Localbitcoin pose are not as high as yours!!! Localbitcoin are a honey pot for attack that can be guarded against. You are a honey pot for an attack that has no defense!!

1. So if this happens, who then is liable for compensating the buyer in this case? If Hodl hodl is not liable, then how can your platform be considered safe at all. As a cryptoseller one could basically hack your system this way. There is no repercussion for this act. 
2. Why can't you have a 2 of 3 between buyer, seller and hodl hodl? I can't see how a new layer arbitration is of any use. You may as well own full custody. It will simply be argued that hodl hodl and other arbitrators are in bed.

so there will be two multisig escrows. One for trading and another for security deposit?

Is there a reason why you can't opt for a simple 2 of 3 between buyer, seller and hodl hodl. Instead of having to require traders to hold a security deposit.
