Ideally each recipient would also have the possibility to do the same and this automatically.
For example, if the song writer relied on a friend for proofreading and another for inspiration he or she could give a share to each.

A proper tickle-down economics tool.
We have tips but basically a person tip the last link of the value chain. In the pre-virtual currency era it made sense as it was the only realistic scenario. Now with lower feers and facilitated claimable small amounts the situation is, I believe, mature enough to change.
If you could develop a system where I could tip (or pay, as you prefer) not just the person who posted content but rather him or her AND everybody involved in the process with a fair share I think it would have great potential.
The typical example would be a song posted here, I would like to tip :
* 05% to the person who shared the link (in addition to sweet sweet karma)
* 20% to the song writter
* 10% to the violonist
* 20% to the pianist
* 25% to the singer
* 10% the sound engineer
* 10% the visual designer
One could imagine the same with fruits and vegetables freshly produced.
I think so far this was ridiculous to even conceive but today, it is possible. I think it would lead to much more open and hopefully a more fair economical system.
PS: Initially I think people would be a bit scared of such complication but I believe used once or twice it would become quite easy and natural. Eventually one could imagine complexification on top e.g. the used would be allowed to adjust percentage according to his own view or appreciation (easily visualized with a pie chart).

None as you can check against the blockchain which addresses are active, lookups aren't time consuming so millions isn't such a big number. Also if you don't do it properly you could reveal through the logs of your database or filesystem which wallets have been accessed (and thus used) recently. Both are trivial for somebody who would be able to hack your computer.

Agreed, I could imagine a browser or browser plugin that monitors the time spent each day on websites and gives a share of a predefined sum accordingly.
For example say I spend 10% of my time on Reddit and gave a daily budget of 100mBTC Reddit would get 10mBTCs on that day.

I don't think the doubts about 90% have anything to do with Bitcoin per se, rather they advise for hedging or a balanced portfolio. You can believe entirely in something without still wanted to expose yourself to too much risk that you admit you can not foresee.

Naive summary, centralization found in :
* Services : mining pool coordinators, web wallets, simplified payment verification nodes, exchanges
* Protocol updates : core developpers, key owners of alert message mechanism, BIP reviewers
Nothing surprising there but indeed a proper critic on decentralization.

Genuine question : how do you actually proceed in such a situation if you have say $100 000 in a Ukrainian bank?
I've never been in such a place (and I hope I won't) but according to what I saw in Cyprus, Argentina and in other places WHEN shit happens accounts are frozen. If so it means you can't withdraw cash and buy bitcoins (or anything else), you can't make SEPA transfers to an exchange, etc.
Even if the account is *not* frozen you have daily and weekly limit with your bank and your cards so, quite simply, how do you do it in practice?
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:21:12

Yes there is no Bitcoin in the title but after using some mobile wallets few times and showing to friends it feels the same easy of use exist without using Bitcoins.
I'm not even implying that banks learnt from Bitcoin mobile wallets just that... they are not just sitting on their asses watching the world move.
And yes this is big for Belgium since "86% of all card payments in Belgium are Bancontact/Mister Cash transactions"

"The basic idea behind these findings is that Bitcoin entry nodes, to which the user’s computer connects in order to make a transaction, form a unique identifier for the duration of user’s session. This unique pattern can be linked to a user’s IP address. Moreover, transactions made during one session, even those made via unrelated pseudonyms, can be linked together. With this method, hackers can reveal up to 60% of the IP addresses behind the transactions made over the Bitcoin network." cf

Indeed, and even "For example a friend of mine just picked up some concert tickets and I paid him for my share cell phone to cell phone." does not work in Belgium any more since you can do that with your debit and credit card app even between different banks.

Indeed that's why I didn't mean to make a Bitcoin application.
I meant replace a simple bank application that send and receive token as money but the same application over the blockchain. The students do not have to even know what Bitcoin is to do that, the instructor could use a library that just have functions like pay(), check_balance(), etc...
If students are curious they could delve into Bitcoin itself but the main goal would still be to learn programming.
