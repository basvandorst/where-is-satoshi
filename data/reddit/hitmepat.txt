There's a hidden benefit to allowing big companies to consolidate a ton of dust though...  If no one ever does it, and mining fees stay in the 100-200 sat/byte range forever...at some point all 21 million BTC will be spread out into 21 quadrillion addresses with 100 sats each and bitcoin as a whole will be worthless.

Five years is a strange time frame to choose.   I would bet most of the coins that were last moved in 2014 are **not** lost.  A lot are probably lost.  But not most.  By 2014 bitcoin cost hundreds of dollars a piece, and were just as easy as it is today to secure.  
Some folks saved their 12 word seed and their old android phone in a drawer somewhere and plan on selling them in 20 years.  Or just have so many bitcoin they keep a big chunk sitting safe in cold storage.   "Updating cold storage" is a pretty ridiculous concept if you have the keys/seed saved somewhere safe.  What is there to update?
If they counted ones that haven't moved since 2012...I'd bet most of those are lost.

Being short means you made a bet that the price of bitcoin will go down.  Essentially you take X dollars and buy a contract against someone who thinks the price will go up.  You essentially "sell" him X dollars worth of bitcoin at today's price, and agree to buy them back from him at some date in the future.  If the future date comes and the BTC price is down, you get the dollar equivalent of the price difference between the day you made the bet and the current price.   
Being liquidated means the shorter didn't have enough cash in reserve to cover their losses, because the price rose too high.  They don't have enough dollars in their trading account to buy back the amount of bitcoin they owe.
@_date: 2019-07-18 23:02:28
The exchange closes the position right when the price hits the point when the liquidated trader has enough funds to cover.  And they're left with zero.

I'm trying to follow this and still not clear.  Why doesnt every currency pair change vs the USD with the devaluation and cancel out the effect?
Like for example;  a Japanese company wants to buy an expensive piece of manufacturing equipment from GE that costs 1 million USD today. And 1 USD is 100 yen today (using round numbers for simplicity).  Next week the US treasury prints a few hundred billion dollars and debases the value of the dollar by 10%.   Why would the Japanese company care if that same equipment costs 1.10 million USD next week?  The USD:Yen exchange rate at that point should be 1 USD for 90 Yen.  The company still pays 100 Yen for the item in the end...
What am I missing?

Look up "Brainflayer" on YouTube.
A brain wallet is a private key generated from a phrase you remember.  Like "One fish two fish red fish blue fish" or "twas the night before Christmas" or whatever phrase you want.   The whole reason bitcoin works is because it's hard for a computer to guess the right random number between 0 and 2^256 ...  But when you use a brain wallet, you are decreasing that randomness down to a small set that a computer can easily guess.   Every single phrase from every single book/song/movie/famous quote in every single language etc can be guessed with Brainflayer.    And the keys will be swept.  Brain wallets do not work.

In general you wouldn't.  Mining only beats buying and holding if you get free or nearly free electricity.
By the time you pay the start up costs of buying your mining hardware, you're payback horizon (break even ROI) can be a year or two without even taking into account the blockchains difficulty adjustment.  Since difficulty pretty much always tends to go up over time...many miners never even break even.  
A lot of small miners mine at a loss.  The big ones that actually make profit only can do so because they have very cheap electricity, or because they got good deals on miners by buying in bulk.  Or they swindled people into paying the start up costs for them with hash rate selling schemes.

Being a node isn't just about locking up your bitcoin to earn lightning fees.  Those fees will be very small.
The point of being a node is being able to move your bitcoin.   You open 2 or 3 channels with random businesses of people or services or whoever...and now you can move your bitcoin through the whole lightning network with almost 0 fees, and hopefully you rarely need to close and reopen channels.
Today if you want to make 20-50 bitcoin transactions in a month you pay fees 20-50 times and 20-50 transactions are recorded to the blockchain.   With lightning you can make 100s of transactions while only opening 2 or 3 channels and paying 4 or 6 transaction fees.

Segwit is Segregated Witness for short.  It's basically a format for transactions that uses less block space.  So you can get more transactions in each block which come every 10 minutes.

A paper wallet is 100% secure if you generate the keys correctly on an air gapped computer (or manually with dice or cards or what have you).

You can send any amount of bitcoin you want today for 20 cents or 50 cents.  And it'll be confirmed in a couple blocks.  Unless you are combining dozens of inputs for that 40$ transaction...that might cost you 3 or 4 dollars.   But saying it "doesn't work" depends on what you want it to do.  Do you want to buy 2$ coffees every day?  It doesn't work very well for that at the moment.  Do you want to send 100,000$ anywhere for any reason?  It's the best protocol in the world with the lowest fees for that use case at the moment.   Do you want to just sit on it and watch it double in value every few months?  It's the best at that also.

Unless you think 500$ per coin is the max it will ever reach there's no reason to stop buying at some arbitrary number just because you can't buy as many coins with your 50$.  If you were in your 20s in the 1990s and applied that advice to apple or Google stock, how would that have worked out?  
Compound interest is your friend here.  $50 worth of btc is $50 worth of btc no matter if that's .2 btc or .0001 btc if the price goes to the moon.  And if you believe BTC will succeed in the long haul then that investment will continue to go up.

OP - you can import your wallet.dat file into a local SPV wallet like multibit or electrum and create a TX to move the coins to another wallet without having to download the entire block chain.  You are right to not trust blockchain.info or any other Web based wallets.  
I'd recommend multibit because it's the only one I've used and it's easy to import a wallet.dat file, then either create a paper wallet on an offline computer or buy a hardware wallet like ledger or trezor and move your funds there from multibit.

It's a concern but things like $/kb  for network transactions is supposed to reach an economic equilibrium.

But an issuer who's securing billions of dollars in assets on the block chain will want to have that security backed up by something beefy....more distributed hashing power.

Difficulty adjusts based on hash rate.  If "no one" would be willing to mine a block for the btc in tx fees, hash rate will go down until difficulty decreases to the point where someone will mine it.  It's an equilibrium.
You are also assuming the price of BTC in USD is going to be the same when the block reward goes away as it is today.  That won't be the case.

@_date: 2015-06-12 23:10:15
The limit updates to 2mb at the hard fork and the miners can start voting on the next limit.  After 12k blocks a new limit is set based on miners preference and persists for the next 12k blocks.  Every limit adjustment is a soft fork built in.

OP how do the bitcoin payments work?  Their FAQ says they need your credit card info...
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:28:33
Well if the price dropped to $0.01 USD per btc and the block reward stayed the same as it is now, hash rate would drop like a rock since it's not economical to pay for the electricity.   If a small group agree to secure the network with a minimum amount of hashing powet to protect their "blockchain applications" (whatever they may be) that can function regardless of the price of btc, the network would still work as it currently does for those applications.  It just wouldn't be efficient to use Bitcoins as money.  And there wouldn't be any incentive for attackers to spin up hash rate to try and 51% attack, since the coins themselves would be worthless.
@_date: 2015-06-11 14:03:11
A successful attack that breaks SHA-256 or a well funded alt coin that somehow takes the hash rate away from BTC.
Barring one of those two I think holding BTC is a safe bet if your time horizon is longer than a year or two.

The only way for it to not average &lt;10 mins per block is if hash rate decreases between difficulty adjustments more often than it increases.

Coinbase is easy enough if people want to "invest"...but the people who just buy and hold on coinbase or any exchange are not really using bitcoin the way it's meant to be used.

It's my understanding that if you import the keys to blockchain.info it will be propagated as a transaction with a normal fee, and the btc will be confirmed in the next block before the older 0 fee transaction.

I've never used one.  They charge a high % fee compared to a company like coinbase.  If you just wanna pick up 20$ worth to learn how a Wallet works and get your feet wet an ATM might be the best route... but if you're putting in a lot of money I'd try to minimize fees with an actual exchange.

all new transactions seem to jump above it in priority as they are placed.  why would it ever confirm if it's always going to be such a low priority relative to others?

The smaller fork will become obsolete and as far as the larger fork is concerned those "prefork  coins" are just Bitcoins.

I'm no expert but my gut tells me that the exchange will send the coins out to all of your addresses and they will be relatively untraceable to the originators exchange account...Until you use the HD wallet to transfer bitcoins and two addresses have to combine inputs to make the tx.  Once that happens those two addresses are traceable to a single account at the exchange.

Why not just make the devices all pre loaded with a few thousand Satoshi and roll that into the cost you pay when you buy the device?  The device doesn't need to mine to use bitcoin.

The struggle alt coins face is attracting miners to secure their networks.   Miners will always mine the most profitable chain.  And you can't have a high market cap without a high hash rate. Since no one wants to have millions of dollars invested in a crypto if it's blockchain could be attacked and taken over by someone with $100,000 worth of hardware... so you kind of have a chicken and egg scenario.   Can't attract huge value without lots of hash power.  Can't attract huge hash power without lots of value.

2$ worth of BTC is .0045 BTC or so at today's exchange rate.  To get that 2$ to grow to 1.3 billion $ would mean one BTC would have to grow to about 280 billion dollars per coin.  When all 21 million coins are issued that would be a bitcoin market cap of some ______illion that I don't even know the prefix for.  Quintillion?  
I think the power ball odds are better.  But the odds that your 2$ could grow to 20 or 200 dollars some day are probably better than winning the power ball.

Doesn't this mean he has to hope he can solve additional blocks before the rest of the network solves the first one?  It seems like he'd need a ton of the relative hashing power more than the article suggests.
I'm imagining a "selfish mining pool" or miner which solves block X and doesn't transmit it, then goes on to keep working on the secret chain for an hour or something.  Maybe he solves block X+1 or X+2 in that time if he's lucky.   But in the meantime another miner solves block X and its confirmed 20 times, X+1 is solved by another miner and confirmed 15 times, X+2 is confirmed, etc....will the network care about the selfish miners chain?

It's hard to buy 25k bitcoin on an exchange at the current market price.  Because every btc you buy makes the price go up...the markets aren't liquid enough to let you buy in that volume without affecting the price.
This is the reason whoever made the offer doesn't just buy 25k btc on bitstamp or bitfinex or any other exchange.  Doing a market buy for 25kbtc would clear out the order books and you'd be paying way over current market price for the last few thousand coins.

OP - what was the purchase price when you bought them?  That is the price that the purchase is locked in at. 
If it was 750$/BTC and you spent 1000$ you will get 1.33 BTC.  Whether the price goes down to 500$ or up to 1000$ you will still receive 1.33 BTC when the transaction clears.
I don't know why the instant buy didn't trigger.  Coinbase warns you right before you hit the final "OK" or confirm button to buy whether the bitcoin will be in your account instantly or whether they will arrive by a certain date.

I had the same fears before i bought mine.  But the firmware is open source too.  And you can verify the authenticity of your specific device of the firm ware by checking it against a checksum that's published.
I don't know how to verify the source code myself (I'm no programmer or cryptographer) but the general gist in the crypto currency community is that since it's public, SOMEONE smart would have called the software out by now if it was unsafe.

With trezor you can generate and sign transactions on mytrezor.com from any PC and you don't need to worry about the PC being infected with malware because the trezor doesn't expose the keys to the PC.
You can also use trezor with mycelium for android (and I think some other mobile wallets) very easily.  You don't need a separate PC running linux.
I only use a separate PC running a Linux OS for making paper wallets.  Trezor + Mycelium is a good secure cold or hot wallet.

OP-  the amount of BTC doesn't matter in dermining the fee to set.  What matters is the size of the transaction in bytes.  If you have 10 inputs to make that 5 BTC transaction, the fee needs to be higher than a 1 input transaction that sends 1000 BTC.

Do not accept a paper wallet as a cash out option from any website.  Any website that provides you a paper wallet also has a copy of the keys on that paper wallet.  So they can steal your coins if they choose.
If you're interested in making your own paper wallets I recommend using bitaddress.org.   There are many tutorials online on how to do this   the most secure way to do it is to save bitaddress.org HTML file to a flash drive and run it on a non-internet connected computer.  Malware on your system can snipe your keys if you aren't careful.

If traders see a 25k btc wall that never gets pulled at a certain price and sold into it a little, it'd eventually stop getting eaten up as someone would place a buy order just above that wall.

The odds of the *next flip* being heads again are 1/2.  But the odds of hitting ONE tails at least in 20 flips isn't 1/2.  It's 1-(1/2)^20 which for all intents and purposes is almost a 100% chance of getting one tails in 20 flips.
In the 1 in 420 million chance of finding a block scenario, the odds of finding one in 144 blocks is 1-(419,999,999/420,000,000)^144.   Which is effectively ~1 in 3 million.

A paper wallet is a bitcoin private key printed out or written down on a piece of paper.  If you have the key, you can transfer the bitcoin.  The coins aren't "stored offline" necessarily.  The blockchain is a record of what addresses all the bitcoins ever created are sitting in and nothing about that can be moved offline.  It'll always be visible on the blockchain.
But if you generate a private key/address pair in a secure way such that the private key isn't stored on any device connected to the internet then send coins to that address, the bitcoin are "offline" in the sense that no one can hack your computer or device and steal the coins.

If they both keep forking though it can be difficult to know which ones the "real" one.
The miners have too much power.  If the users combined all had mining power to match the huge mining farms, it'd be obvious which chain to follow.

The economic incentive is supposed to keep them honest, but will it work?

Mostly its just the title is misleading and users on this sub know better.  It's the  misinterpretation of "integrates digital assets" that implies Coinbase = Bitcoin.  
But coinbase isn't bitcoin.  It is a great service that provides an on ramp to bitcoin for a lot of people (I've used it), but once you have the coins they're not supposed to stay in your Coinbase wallet.  That's not how it's meant to be used.  
"Chancellor on the brink of second bailout"...Bitcoin is a system to circumvent the banks, and Coinbase is a bank.  I'm all for fidelity integrating coinbase customers accounts into their website.  It's great.  I just take issue with the way the title makes you think it's actually integrating with the *actual* digital currencies.

If you have an address with 10 coins in it and 100,000 addresses with .0001 each in them, you could try and make a transaction with all 100,001 inputs for all of it and pay a huge fee like 0.5 BTC to try and get all that dust into a useble output.   Or if you get in touch with a pool operator you could get them to force your inputs into a block even without the 0.5 btc fee.

Your point about finding the blocks faster therefore nothing is lost doesn't seem right.

That wont happen.  It will always be an equilibrium.    
If the cost of miners becomes lower(more profitable to mine) demand for miners goes up driving up the price of the hardware, and it also drives hash rate up reducing the reward for mining.
It will always find an equilibrium where it's either just barely profitable for some people and slightly unprofitable for others.  Assuming no change in the value of the coin.

@_date: 2018-06-05 20:30:40
You are correct.  The economics will always drive the coss/rewards of mining close to a 0-sum game for miners, unless they are counting on the coin price increasing to shorten their ROI time.   In which case they'd be better off having just spent their investment on coins directly rather than buying rigs to mine the coins themselves.
That being said, the network needs miners, and more efficient ASICS are better.   So I encourage all miners to buy the best hardware and keep the hash rate up.  Plus the folks who run small rigs at a break even or at a loss will benefit more buying one of these than an S9.

This would be a pretty straightforward lawsuit if anyone bought BCH from them, right?  Like if I made a website selling season tickets to Fenway for baseball season...and after you clicked "Buy Red Sox Season Tickets", the next page you enter your payment info on, and I send you Cincinati Reds seasons tickets...that would be a problem.  Right?

If you've only ever used coin base to buy and hold, you have no responsibility to report to the IRS.  Right?  Only once you've sold BTC for fiat and failed to report the income or capital gains would you be in violation.
If you've transferred coins off CB and then used them to purchase anything or do anything other than hold them...you'd also have to report the change in value and count it as income and pay taxes appropriately.  But just getting coinbases records won't be able to show where your coins have moved.
Tl;dr the only people who need to fear the IRS are those who have bought and sold and never reported.

You brought the comparison to fiat into this.  "Down 50% in 2 years" is a comparison to fiat.  1 BTC still equals 1 BTC.  
I agree you need fiat to pay bills and do transactions in the short term (for now).  
The goal is to only hold as little of it as possible for as short a time as possible.  Because its guaranteed to just keep going down down down in purchasing power until it fizzles out and hyperinflates itself into the history books.  Buying hard assets like precious metals, real estate, and crypto (and even stocks/bonds to some extent even though those aren't really "hard" assets) with whatever fiat you can spare after paying the bills each month is what will protect your wealth in the long run.

True, if the coin price is dropping, buying  miners will beat out buying and holding a diminishing asset, but sitting out entirely is better than both buying and holding or mining in that case.  If you waited til today you could probably buy more than 2x the amount of coins you could have when you bought your miners, and that 1 month would be a much longer time til ROI.  People only buy miners or coins if they are expecting the price of the coin will go up.   
If the price is going up, it's hard to mine the number of coins you could have just bought for that price plus electricity.   Some people will win and some will lose, depending on electricity cost/how long their rig last/how much difficulty goes up.   But in general either Holding&gt;Mining or Sitting Out&gt;Mining for most people.  Only people with free electricity or are getting great deals on miners from the manufacturer are better off spending their money on miners instead of coins.

If he bought them in 2009/2010 like OP said, the 3000 BTC probably only cost like $1....and then he turned down selling them for 3k per coin? So he turned down 9 million dollars...but doesnt even know what a wallet is??
Something seems fishy.  At that time anyone could have just mined a few thousand BTC on their desktop computer in a few days/weeks, depending on what point of 2009 or 2010 this allegedly took place.

You intentionally ignored his point, which was clear as day.  The point of the thread is:  The scam bait and switch on bitcoin.com where they are intentionally fooling people into buying BCH when they think they're buying bitcoin.  
The fact that you and a few hundred other people in the crypto sphere want to argue about what the *real* bitcoin is and which coin deserves the name isn't a factor in the discussion. 
The term "Bitcoin" is used in main stream news articles and financial tv shows regularly now and has been for a while.  And none of them are talking about BCH when they say Bitcoin.  So anyone going to **Bitcoin.com** to try and buy some **Bitcoin** is absolutely being scammed when the site tricks them into buying BCH.

I dont think you can assume there will be infinite free energy in the future.
It's a silly/impossible scenario but if all ~7.6 billion people on earth have access to almost unlimited free electricity and trivially cheap asics, then hash rate **and difficulty** go ridiculously high.   Everyone is on an equal playing field and competing  for blocks.  In that scenario you're looking to get 1 block reward out of every 7.6 billion blocks...which on average would take 144,000 years.   So your "break even" point would be somewhere between never, and immediately.    
And it would still be in equilibrium where it cost almost 0 and you gain almost 0.

So if you can't (or wont) provide cryptographic proof you own the coins, how do they determine your tax liability?  The cost you bought them at vs their value when you transfer them out of coinbase?  For people who don't keep their coins in coinbase wallets, those two values are going to be pretty much equal and you'd owe little to no tax.

What you call sub accounts are addresses.  A wallet like Ledger uses a seed to generate as many addresses as it needs.  Each time you want to receive btc the wallet will generate a new address for you.  The blockchain cannot associate the addresses as coming from the same seed.
But the link between the addresses can make itself known when you send BTC if the transaction you make takes outputs from multiple addresses.
Example: you receive 1 BTC in address A from Alice, and 1 BTC in address B from Bob.   The blockchain doesn't have a way to know address A and B are both owned by you.   But then you make a transaction that sends 2 BTC to Joe.   Your wallet combines the coins in address A and B and sends one transaction.   Now everyone knows that A and B were (most likely) owned by the same person.
@_date: 2019-08-08 23:59:26
Write down the seed.  Send yourself some small amount like .0001 btc.  Once it confirms, factory reset the trezor and restore from the seed to make sure you wrote it correctly.   If you see your .0001 BTC are there you know for sure you didn't misprint your seed.

Almost every case of hyper inflation in the last century was caused by central banks intentionally increasing the monetary supply to finance government debt and budget deficits.  
This is undoubtedly the fate of the USD.  And before that the Yen and the Euro.  It could be when we are dead in the ground and our children are old men in a few decades, or it could happen 2-10 years from now.  No one knows when, but it will happen.  No serious economist thinks this system is stable indefinitely.  It's only stable for a lifetime or so at best.   We have only been using a fiat dollar for 40 something years.  And our economy is already showing signs of strain....unsustainable debt and deficits and absurdly unbalanced wealth/income inequality.  It's not sustainable.
The average fiat currency lasts 25-30 years.  The USD is safer than most (predominately because the USD is backed up by the US military), but it is still all smoke and mirrors.  You cant create "value" from nothing by fiat.   Yet that's what the Fed attempts to do every day.  It will not last.

Bitcoin is something you cant create without doing the work and mining them and following the protocol.  Fiat currencies continue to be inflated out of thin air.  The fed has injected hundreds of billions (with a B) to finance banks gambling in just the last month  .    
Fiat is a house of cards and it **is guaranteed** to go to zero.  It might not seem like it, because it's a slow bleed.  But at some point the house of cards starts to crumble and the central bank has to other options but to hyper inflate.    We might be 50 years away from hyper inflation....we might be 5 years away... but it is guaranteed.  That is the nature of central banking and fiat currencies.
@_date: 2019-10-30 01:04:56
Its really simple and if you really want to know more just learn some economics.  Supply and demand.  When the supply is *infinite* and the demand is *anything* (ie; high, low, medium, who cares) , the price goes to zero.  In fiat systems the supply is infinite.

I googled it because I didn't believe that figure but it looks like mining is estimated ~30 TWh per year and worldwide electricity consumption is ~180,000 TWh per year so the approximately 0.15% figure is correct.
But a lot of fossil fuels contribute to pollution without ever being used to generate electricity.   And I think bitcoin mining probably has a higher than average percentage of its TWh being generated by renewables.  The amount of "pollution" and global warming contributed from crypto mining is definitely way lower than 0.15% of what the total is.  So for the value mining crypto adds to society, I still think it's a small cost.  But I'll keep an open mind.

Right.  In that aspect it's not similar at all.  But what I meant and what I think the poster above me meant was that ripple works like a 2nd layer solution.  XRP runs on the bottom layer (like bitcoin does in lightning) and settles accounts from the second layer.
My point was that the difference is...with ripples set up, there doesn't need to be any value to the coin on the bottom layer.  It's strictly a cryptographic proof that the second layer transactions are settled.   So XRP has no reason to be in demand... It's price makes no sense.

It sounded like the poster above me was suggesting they do send it, but only send it to enough miners to hit the magic 51% of hash power, while excluding the other 49%.   If "not sending it" is the answer, then the miner  would need to control 51% of the hashpower themself...which is already a well known exploitable attack vector.

it's not that they "disappear", they just won't be for sale at/near the current price.  At some price point, supply will increase because people will take their profits.   
Think of it like an imaginary exchange order book depth chart.  I may not have a limit sell set for 50k....but you better believe if I woke up and the price was 50k, I'd sell some coins.    
So most of the the coins in circulation are available for sale...just not til we reach prices that will motivate holders to sell.  When supply and demand are in equilibrium price stabilizes.  Right now supply is low and demand is high.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:42:26
When you short you basically say "I believe BTC is going to go down in price, so I'll agree to sell you bitcoin X days from now for some price (below current market price)."   Say that price is 7000$ for example.   If BTC crashes to 6000, the person with the short can market buy a bitcoin for 6000 and sell it for 7000 because he has an option to do so.   
Shorting doesn't drive price down the same way selling actual bitcoin does.  It just becomes profitable for the shorter when the price goes down.

Yes I agree ripple is sort of like lightning.  The problem is XRP can literally have a value of $0.00001 per XRP and it would still serve it's function as the native currency of the ripple protocol.   For parties to settle their debt instruments on the ripple network they need to use XRP only when they close their "channels" to put it in lightning terminology.  And it doesn't matter if the XRP is worth 100000 dollars or .00001 pennies.  It can still be used to settle a billion dollar debt.  It's just a marker thats used to keep accurate account of the other centralized debt instruments on the network.   In fact, it'd be **bad** for ripple users (banks) if XRP were to skyrocket in value because it makes using the network cost more. 
The messed up thing is that the ICO'd their "coin" out into the world and hyped it up like it'd be of some use to the buyers, but it never will be.   20 big banks can have 20 XRP each and use ripple forever, transacting fractions of an XRP between each other to settle their balance sheets and never caring what an XRP is worth in dollars.

Not quite.  The calculations adjust based on how much hashing power is mining, to keep the block generation near 1 block/10 minutes.  They can get easier if hash power drops, so they are not becoming exponentially harder.   
The reason the number of coins added decreases over time is because the reward per block halves every 2 years or so.

The method you describe sounds extremely secure and random to our simple human minds but code like Brainflayer and it's peers are built specifically to find addresses generated that way.

OP -  what you are frustrated with is not "Bitcoin as a service."   Bitcoin isn't a service, it's a protocol.  You are frustrated with Coinbase and Circle.  They are not the same as "Bitcoin" they just provide a platform for buying selling and transferring bitcoin.  Coinbase is Bitcoin in the same way Comcast is the internet.  Like a poster above said, the friction comes when companies like those are forced to comply with different governments regulations.  If your Comcast service is crappy, you can't blame the internet in general.   It's the service provider.
Using the bitcoin protocol does not require any kind of ID.  It's permissionless.  Getting your hands on Bitcoin can be tough if you aren't willing or able to jump through the types of hoops coinbase and Circle require, but there are many ways to do it without those types of intermediaries.

Sell for what??   Unless bitfinex is going to run off with all the users BTC, BTC price should go up since it's the only way for users to flee bitfinex and get out of there without losing everything.   If tether really goes belly up, there should be huge premiums on USDT denominated exchanges and USD exchanges will stay well below them.  Until everyone who sold their BTC on tether exchanges is left holding the bags of worthless tether.   Then BTC price on the legit exchanges will need to find a new equilibrium without the influence of tether on the market...where that equilibrium will be is anyone's guess.

Bitcoin has the biggest average block size because it has the most transactions.   It was the first and it's by far the most popular crypto.  Of course there will be the most nodes on the bitcoin network.
There are other alts that have higher max block sizes than BTC but will never fill because there are not as many users.  You could draw the same conclusion that having a high max block size decreases node count if you cherry pick an alt with high max block size and few nodes.

I agree with your point of view that regulation is the root cause of the net neutrality mess.  But i disagree with the course of action to solve the problem.  You can't throw net neutrality away because it's seen as just a symptom of a larger problem.
If your house is burning down because your oil burner malfunctioned, you don't go fix the heater first before you put the fire out.   Yea the heater (government sponsored ISP monopoly) is the cause of the fire, but the immediate danger is the fire.   
Keep the ISPs honest and fair via regulation, while you work to deregulate the things that gave the ISPs the power to take advantage in the first place.  The house is already catching on fire.  Put that out first and then look to correct the root cause.

In your example that guy with 1k bitcoin from 2011 probably would have sold a couple hundred in 2012 for ~20$ each, a couple hundred more in 2013 for several hundred dollsrs each, sold some more in 2017 for a few thousand each...etc.   He would still have a few hundred BTC left for the scenario where it goes to $100k.  And still would probably never sell 100%.
Conversely if someone bought 1k worth in Nov 2013, they got around 1 bitcoin...  If they held till march 2017 and 100% cashed out at 3k, they would be kicking themselves for the last 2 years.
Once someone has held long enough they are in it for the end game.  Not to make a small profit of a few thousand or tens of thousands.  
True long term holders will never sell their last satoshi.  The fomo is too strong.

Are your transactions confirmed on the block chain?  If so, go into mycelium and go into the "sign message" menu.  Scroll through and see if the address is listed in the list.  If so, mycelium does have the private key so your funds are safe.  They'll wind up showing up when mycelium servers and nodes catch up.

The answer is still no.  And the fact that it's centralized is part of the reason it's a bad investment.
The main reason it's a bad investment is that XRP is just a token used as a bean to count when settling private side chains.  It doesn't matter if XRP is worth .00001$.  The function it serves to the people (mainly companies/banks) using ripple is to settle transactions between their side chains.  And the people who've bought into XRP and maintain the price in the $0.20 range don't know that.  They have heard ripple is a company doing big money deals with banks (it is) and they think that will make XRP valuable/useful (it won't). 
Someday people will figure this out and XRP will go to $0.01 or less, and the banks and companies using ripple will still keep using it flawlessly and Ripple Labs will make tons of money.  XRP holders will just be screwed.

I think 4 is pretty self explanatory.  In the USA for example, spending bitcoin counts as selling it.
If I bought 1 BTC last year for 600$ and today its worth 1200$, when i walk into a store and buy a 1200$ item with my 1BTC, I now owe the IRS around 130$ for my capital gains on my "sale".
Of course the Point of Sale store probably didnt ask for ID..  so if one could choose to not report that 600$ capital gain, its their own butts they are risking.

I dont know any of the details of this arrangement.   But how can they process my payment off chain?  Does bitflyer have a mandatory wallet app you must use to spend your BTC in japan?  If a customer holds BTC in a wallet like Mycelium or Jaxx  and wants to spend it at a terminal in japan, he either sends the BTC on-chain, or he cant send it at all.   
If Bitflyer is forcing you to let them hold your coins to spend them at all these terminals in japan, you arent really "using bitcoin".   Its no different than buying a Xapo debit or Shiftcard or using any other 3rd party middle man.

There are websites that list "every bitcoin private key" as a joke.
The ones that are "found" with transactions are just ones that are generated with little to no entropy (randomness).   Brain wallets and null inputs and the like generate private keys that are easy to find.    Always use legit random generators to create wallet seeds.

Credit cards aren't cheaper than bitcoin.   A vendor gets charged a fixed % by Visa and MasterCard.  If you buy a 10,000$ item with a credit card the vendor loses 100$ or so on the sale in fees.  With bitcoin the fees are anywhere from free to a few cents (best case, when mempool isn't back logged) up to 2 or 3 dollars worst case when there is a back log of transactions.   2$ in fees is a lot if you're buying a 6$ sandwich....but it's absolutely nothing compared to ACH wire transfer fees or credit card fees if you're moving thousands of dollars.

In your example, the "chips" the casino gave you that became worthless are tethers.  Not bitcoin.   When you go to change the worthless chips for dollars, you're out of luck.   But if you traded those chips for a gold watch (bitcoin) then the sucker who accepted the chips is the one that's out of luck.
In the end the people who hold the chips get burned.  The casino runs away with the dollars.  But the folks who traded the chips for gold watches are relatively unscathed.  When the casino inevitably collapses, your gold watch still has value and you can bring it to another venue or sell it for something else.

In the USA our money and economy are relatively stable, so there's not as many advantages here to using bitcoin as a currency.   Until someday if shit hits the fan and the USD goes into hyperinflation, at that point you may wish you had cared about bitcoin.   
For me it's mostly just exciting to know that no one controls my BTC but me.   The government can't sieze it, the banks can't block me from accessing it, and I can spend it on anything without permission from anyone.   I may be 99% sure my government and/or bank will never try to seize/block me from my account balances...but if they did, I'm powerless to stop them.  With bitcoin they couldnt do it even if they want to.   Look at Greece and Cyprus when the banks seized deposits to pay for government debt as two sad examples.  Could it happen in the US too?  Yes.  Hopefully it never does but bitcoin is a hedge against that eventuality.    
If you were to ask someone in Venezuela if they would rather get paid 100$ equivalent in Venezuela Bolivars or 100$ equivalent in Bitcoin...many would say bitcoin because that 100$ in Bolivars is going to be worth 10$ in a month.

Is it even possible to recieve bitcoin on LN without first having Bitcoin, and using it to open a channel on the lightning network?  If you dont have a LN node with an open channel that has "inbound capacity"...you cant recieve LN payments.  Right?

The way to do that is to get consensus and convince all (majority of) the nodes, miners, and users to agree to fork based on the merits of the upgrade, as satoshi intended.   Consensus.   
BCH ran a troll campaign and convinced enough people that Bitcoin developers were the illuminati or something, and forked recklessly with less than a third of the hash rate thanks to its backing by the biggest mining hardware manufacturer who was trying to wrestle control of bitcoin from the users.   It didn't work.  Then they forced the "satoshis vision - real bitcoin" narrative on reddit and bitcoin.com to continue to try and scam people.

They already use our money to make money by leveraging their holdings (our deposits) against risky loans and investments to earn them a return.   We get 0.025% on our checking accounts while our banks take the billions of dollars in deposits they hold (our money) and leverage them into risky gambles.  Like giving mortgages to hundreds of thousands of people even though many shouldn't qualify.  
All the while they know that when their house of cards inevitably falls (again) it's our money  that's flushed down the toilet and the government will have no choice but to bail them out to keep the citizens from rising up in revolt when we are all broke because of the banks fuckery.
So fuck banks and fuck their 25$ fees and negative interest rates.

The benefit of owning it directly is that you aren't putting your faith in Robinhood to pay back your IOU they hold for you.  They're basically running a fractional reserve where you (and everyone else on Robinhood who bought bitcoin) have a paper receipt saying you own 1 bitcoin.  Really you do not.  It is possible that 100 million people could own 1 "Robinhood Bitcoin"...or IOU...or whatever you call it.  Even though only 21 million Bitcoin can ever exist in reality.   If there were a "run on the banks" type scenario and folks want to cash out their IOUs, you can wind up in a situation where real bitcoin is trading at ~10k or whatever, but on Robinhood there are no buyers and you can only get ~5k for them there.  
The whole point of bitcoin, and the reason bitcoin trades for over 10k today, is because that trust in institutions has been repeatedly betrayed over the course of history.  With bitcoin you dont need trust.  You alone own it.

It didnt send the .31 because that was a separate unspent output.
If you recieve three payments of 0.5 btc to the same address, you will have three 0.5 unspent outputs.  If you want to send 0.6 BTC somewhere, it will need to use 2 of your unspent outputs to make the transaction.  0.6 will be sent and you'll get 0.4 as change.
If you were to send exactly 0.5, it would just spend one of the outputs and there would be zero change.

A lot of cryptos can be brought down by anyone who wants to spend a couple million dollars on hardware.  To take down bitcoin, an attacker needs to match hash rate of the rest of the miners.  The higher the hash rate it is, the harder it is to attack.  
Long story short, it would take tens of billions of dollars to try and attack bitcoin.  Not a couple million.

They are not different they are the same thing.   Instead of staying in consensus with the network, they started their own separate fork with a minority of the hash rate.   They created a new consensus on a separate chain. They didnt get support for their fork from the majority.

What scenario are people concerned about the block time to confirm your transaction?  
Sending money from one bank account to another by wire takes 2-3 business days minimum.  Internationally even longer, with high fees.  Credit card transactions are reversible (not settled) for 30+ days.  
When you swipe your Visa and walk out of a store, that transaction isn't "confirmed" in any sense.   The merchant can lose that money to a charge back 2 weeks later.  With bitcoin, you can pay and walk out with 0 confirmations and the vender can be more certain that money will arrive (irrevocably) in their account than they can with Visa or a check.

It depends on the cost of your electricity and efficiency of your mining hardware.  If you are profitable in a pool, you'll be profitable solo mining.  It just adds a lot more variance to your rate of return.  Either way it's much more profitable than the lottery which is a -EV game.

You can get bitcoin for selling a service anonymously very easily, just download a wallet and give your address to the client.  But turning it back into dollars **anonymously** is much harder (and illegal).   Because to turn your bitcoin back into dollars, you'll need to use an exchange and give your identity, so you wont be anonymous anymore.
You can keep your anonymity by just using the bitcoin to buy other goods and services without ever converting to dollars.   But the options are sorta limited since theres only so many places taking bitcoin as payment.

What I think he's getting at is someone else generated the privkey/address pair themselves that somehow matches OPs.  Basically, they used the same wallet generating software and a glitch with the way they generate entropy causes them to generate the same key.  OP claims it's on a trezor...so I find this scenario extremely unlikely.  
It's either like others have said, and OP has posted his address somewhere public and the sender saw it somewhere and made a copy/paste error, or OP used some low entropy way of generating his key like a brainwallet with a weak phrase that someone else also decided to use.  Definitely not a trezor.  Or OP just made this whole thing up.

Like others have said, you will lose money buying a bitcoin miner because the start up cost is high enough that the amount of coins you'll get per day or week or month is so small that it won't recoup the cost of the hardware.

I gotta disagree.  But it all depends on the motivation of the beginner.   Do they just want to speculate on bitcoin price increasing and make some gains?   If so, sure, stick with coinbase and never learn the basics. 
But if they actually are interested in learning about bitcoin, IMO the best way to learn is to download a legit full wallet like electrum or core on your PC.  And an SPV wallet like Mycellium or Jaxx on your phone. Buy ~5 bucks of bitcoin from a friend or start collecting on faucets, and start sending them around.   
You dont get the same mind blowing satisfaction of bitcoin being transacted from wallet to wallet **without a trusted middleman** when you use coinbase.   Yes, coinbase is great for buying bitcoin.   But anyone who just signs up for coinbase and leaves their coins parked there isn't really using bitcoin.   They might as well be using Paypal.

Bitcoin is the only crypto with enough hash rate to support 100s of billions of dollars in value.  I'm baffled by alts with a 100+ million dollar market cap that could be 51% attacked by a person with 10$ million dollars worth of hardware if they turned their miners on those alts and sabotaged it.

You cant (easily) manually create a transaction using your paper wallet key or seed.  With trezor you can actually spend/transfer the bitcoin without exposing your keys.

Bitcoin ATMs charge crazy premiums.

You are mostly correct.   I think there are two groups who see this event with different goals or objectives.   The first time I saw it posted it was because they wanted people to hold the exchanges accountable by proving solvency. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:15:35


No.   Not in my opinion.   
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:41:56
I think they'll resort to other means to make bitcoin go away before they resort to actually imprisoning and torturing people.
Like anything else, this law sounds like it's designed as a weapon to charge people in cases where they are committing actual crimes with the assets.   Not just a blanket law so that they can sweep up every legit coinbase user in America and force them to hand over their bitcoin or go to jail for 5 years.

Right.  Rich people's wealth is in real estate, stocks, other assets that have value that can't be easily manipulated.   A billionaire doesn't have a billion dollars in his checking account at Bank of America.

Anyone who could get better than a ~50% on this test probably already owns bitcoin.   Either that or they are vehemently anti bitcoin.

If you only have 5 or 10 years to live and are debt free maybe you can retire on 300k....otherwise I would advise OP to keep his job.  
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:10:20
I dont think OP himself understands those things because he could have boiled this test down to 1 or 2 simple questions.
1)  Explain a public/private key as it relates to cryptography
2)  What is proof of work and how does it make cryptocurrencies secure? 
Knowing the name "satoshi"  or being able to name 5 different wallets or whatever is amateur.   
Someone could basically ace OPs quiz and get every answer if they have read CNBC and Forbes articles over the last year....and still accidentally lose all their coins once you send them to them.

Buy a trezor or ledger and keep your seed and pin safe.   That's 10x safer than an exchange.

That's always been my concern too and that's the reason I've never bought a casacious coin even though they're so cool.  The maker of the hologram has the private key.
I think you meant to say BIP38 but I like the idea of being able to send your own encrypted private key to get printed on the hologram...but then if you ever sell it you have to sell the password with it or its worthless.

Many people were afraid miners would go insolvent with half the block reward and drop from the network.  Causing a price decrease.  Causing more miners to drop.  Etc

LOL what?  The SEC turned down the ETF in March to protect investors from the wild uncertainty in the crypto world.  One of those wild uncertainties is the possibility of a chain split...but you think they'll approve an ETF in June or July with an impending chain split on Aug 1st?

This sub these days is 90% butthurt people who bought in above 10k+.   It's pretty sad.  The folks who bought in through 2013-2015 and held through the low triple digits are still sitting on 20x gains but they're quiet in the crypto subs now.
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:26:14
What does "transporting"  10,000$ mean?   Like into or out of the country?   Or would a person taking 10,000$ worth of gold out of his garage safe and into a pawn shop the next town over be required to fill out this from?   Or a person moving from one state to another moves a U Haul truck with all their belongings across state lines?

8 days ago when it went from 2700+ to 1900 you had the chance.  Did you buy?  Because I'm betting there were more people looking to panick sell than eager buyers after that crash.   It's all psychological.  You see the price is 2800 now and so you assume 1900 would be a great entry if you had the chance...but when it **actually** falls 30% it looks like it could keep falling and makes it harder to buy.

Coinbase doesn't need to have the coins on hand.  GDAX sellers provide the coins when you buy from coinbase.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:30:41
I see you're among the 90% I mentioned
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:28:24
Online pokers not specifically illegal either.
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:16:58
If you go to sleep and wake up in 8 hours and find BTC has crashed 30% to ~1900...are you really gonna be excited to buy?   More likely you'll think you were lucky to have not bought at 2800, and just forget about buying at all.  
@_date: 2016-07-06 10:48:47
Could it have been a huge market sell?  Maybe someone on coinbases main site sold 100,000$ worth of BTC and coinbase dumped them all right onto GDAX as a market sell.

I dont get what you're "comparing" in the table.   It's like comparing Steering Wheels to Gasoline.   Ones round.   One smells strongly of ethanol.   One comes out of a pump and one is made of plastic and rubber.   What use is there comparing these things?
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:17:35
These coins are awesome but what guarantees are there that the creator isn't going to swipe the coins someday and just leave you with a coin and no BTC?  Surely they have access to the private keys.

My little brother barely knew what bitcoin was though he'd heard of it.  He was very excited by his paper wallet.  Even more so after I explained more about it to him.  Of course he's a math major and I knew he'd like it.  I didn't buy one for my grandma or my aunts or my boss.  It's all about choosing the person to receive it.

What other evidence do they have?
Digital crimes like this are always so confusing to me.   Cant hackers make anyone with a PC and no anti virus look like a child porn king pin?
If this guy is innocent of the charges and complies with the order, what if they find no child porn but instead evidence of some other crime?  He's an ex police officer, so what if they find out he was taking bribes or some other secret he's trying to hide.  Would they be able to charge him for that or would that evidence be thrown out?

Can you please explain or link to an explanation of a derivation function based key coin is?

What if the sites running the servers are also running mining software dedicated to verifying those blocks with no fees?
