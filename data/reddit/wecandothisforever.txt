So people are going to crowd fund the sewage system? What about all the non glamorous projects in society that are essential?

Yes, but banks have other systems to fall back on. Older methods of trading. AFAIK BTC does not.


Seriously? And who are these people? If BTC really caches on these people are very prone to corruption. They would be way to powerful and a danger.


Sounds like this week with BTC. And what happens if another crypto currency takes over the BTC hype? Everyone flocks to it and BTC drops.


AFAIK you can totally anonimise your BTC transactions. Please correct me if I am wrong. Of course you can do the same with cash but you can carry around, store and use huge amounts of physical currency like you can with BTC. BTC makes this process way way easier.

I said please :)

Yes but this is not the same. A bank can shut down their online banking and update their encryption or go back to older systems. AFAIK there is no such possibility for BTC. Also the value would drop like a rock on simply the news.


This does not mean there is not a bug waiting in the code. And if such a bug was found it would be extremely valuable so there is a lot of incentive to find one of them.


Yes taxes. We need taxes to build roads, hospitals fire departments and all that other good stuff. If its so easy to cheat on the taxes why would not everyone do it?

Of course. But these are not volatile currencies. My fear is that an exploit would crash the BTC market over night. Depending on the size of the BTC market that would be disastrous to individuals or entire countries.


Thank you but I got a 404. Do you not fear that these people are prone to corruption? How is BTC decentralized when its maintained by a group of coders?


Not really. BTC makes this much easier. Its difficult to move large quantities of cash. Moving large amounts of BTC afaik is easy.

Educate me then please.

That is kind of my point. Does Bitcoin have any central management that can migrate Bitcoin over to never and stronger encryptions? If so, who is the central administration?
An increase in computing power is unavoidable and much more powerfull processors are on the way. Does someone have a plan for what will happen then? If not the life expectancy of Bitcoin is reduced.

That is not what I tried to say. I am saying that there is a huge incentive to find a bug. Like nothing we have seen before because its a currency.
If a bank is hacked then that single bank is at risk. If BTC is hacked then the entire currency and all its users are at risk. That is a huge difference. 
Also lets say it takes a while for the developers to figure it out. The price would crash over night in a market panic.

Yes. No need to be sarcastic. Its just that BTC is confusing for many many people. I have looked for answers to these questions but have not been able to find them.
Perhaps if you help out us peons of limited capacity we will spread a positive word about BTC leading to more adoption.
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:22:58
Then please show me why.

Can you link to this information please?


I can understand that. But what would happen to society if no one bothered to pay their taxes? No roads, no hospitals, no health system, no nasa, no esa and so on. Of all the bad sides of government there are also many many upsides.
