Looks like we are back in business! To da moon, hodlgang!
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:27:05
This is all very true, and I am currently doing the same. I have mined with my 4 S9's through many days where I ended up at a net loss for that day. I still believe in the cause and what I am contributing as a miner, but eventually the plug will have to be pulled if things continue south. There is a lot of prominent signs pointing to BTC falling drastically more than it recovering above $10,000 again. Just saying.. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:39:01
Heheh. You a special kind of dumb. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:40:03
Thank you for the useless answer. It takes one to know one. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 10:40:41
Bitcoin is garbage.  Invest in cow manure.  You'll be better off. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:33:46
That's it. Bottom just in. You can buy now. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:34:21
Someone was calling 7k's by this past Sunday last week. They were not far off...
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:28:24
It will not go lower than $7k today. This dump is the result of shorted futures contracts expiring today. I would wait until after the weekend to buy, as it will go lower. We will see a huge jump towards the middle of April, likely back into the 12k range.
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:11:23
BTC is over. It is only a matter of time before we are back in the hundreds. I'd say by the end of April,  sub $1000 will be a reality. All these 'positive' news stories have done absolutely nothing but bring the price down. Maybe by 2020 there will be a chance of breaking $10k. But, with all the financial turmoil and FUD, there is no way this sustains above $1000 for much longer. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:26:26
It's over. It was fun while it lasted. Well no, it wasn't. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:13:29
Sorry if the truth is shattering your dreams. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:49:15
Why are the charts not updating on Coinbase? 
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:58:44
This is painful to watch. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:09:39
This is not real news. It's a standard attempt to drop prices for cheap buying. Oh the manipulation! Oh the zombies! Watch the price zoom back up here. Just watch. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:59:00
Well, it hasn't worked it's way upward for 4 months straight.  It has worked it's way downward.  That is great logic though....
@_date: 2018-03-24 12:15:58
There is a steady decline for 12 hours. Down must be up on your planet. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:36:43
First off, my time on Reddit shouldn't be an indication of my intellect when it comes to seeing the future of bitcoin. I'm as dumb as anyone else in this matter, whether they have been on Reddit for 5 years, are an experienced investment firm or otherwise. Secondly, I am hopeful that the price of BTC goes through the roof, but it's just that, hope. If any of us were being realistic and looking at trends,  it is clear that BTC is on a slow death spiral. Any other opinions that say it isn't, are letting their hopefullness cloud their judgement. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 01:58:52
Yes, I will. I have not been more serious about anything in my life. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:36:33
Surprisingly,  only down a couple grand because  I'm also mining. Though, that is becoming less and less profitable by the day. You do realize that the death spiral is soon to befall us once mining completely loses profitability. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:38:47
...And this means what exactly? The millennial population is broke and dumb. They have no money to invest in cryptocurrency markets, and even if they did, the average millennial wouldn't  have a clue how to properly invest it. Banks are winning this battle and will end up winning the war. That is unless Armageddon breaks out and stops them.
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:43:42
Wtf just happened??
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:43:33
I possess the latter. I'm sure fear-sellers will end up being disappointed. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 04:40:07
Just major price manipulation for short futures contracts expiring tomorrow. After American taxes are done on April 17h, BTC is going to breech 15k again. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:59:51
But, but... I thought you were my friends...
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:15:24
Omg sellll sellllllll! We are all going to lose everything. Cut your losses. It's too fast. Death spiral. Bitcoin is done! No more fun. I just shit my pants! Holy fuck what a rush!!! I come in socks. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:56:56
Omg this is so awesome. Death cross looming. Load up hodlers. This is where the fucking money is made. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:47:58
Like, what!? Huh? Why? How? Just like that a huge dump? From where? Why now?
@_date: 2018-03-26 01:33:43
Pretty sure that's not a reason it will go back up.  Strike one. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:36:40
Well, that was a nice hit of dopamine. How far down will we fall this time? I need another fix. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:22:28
Yeah, this is all over. No way this ever sees over 10K again, ever. This market is more corrupt and manipulated than any on the globe. Good luck, HODLERS. This is the end of the rodeo. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:51:57
But hey, we're in the green now! Right? Am I Right? Guys?
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:16:07
Hahahahaha. That's a clever one. Can I use that one?
@_date: 2018-03-26 01:23:33
No way BTC ever sees over $10k again. Ever. Give me ANY good reason why the price will ever go up that much when it has continually fallen for the past 4 months. This isn't a correction from the ATH in December. This is the sIow, painful death of this coin and this market. Is this going to magically gain traction and surpass the ATH again? Hell no. Even a stiff cock bounces a few times when dropped from a skyscraper before it eventually lies dead in the street.
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:14:34
Yup! The dildo is strong with this one!
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:52:11
Sideways movement? Better get your eyes checked. It's gone down ever since December highs.  Death cross coming this week. Death of Bitcoin to follow. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:35:06
I have insider information that a large buy pump is coming within the next 2 hours. This is not an opinion. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:31:54
This market is complete and utter garbage. Is there actually any reason anyone would bother investing in BTC unless they are day trading? This is a total joke. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:58:23
This is regoddamneddiculous. What is even going on? If this market is so speculative and the average, zombie investor just sells all when things start to drop, how/when can we ever expect Bitcoin to be a viable asset class much less a currency? ...Slowly losing trust in this heap of steaming shit. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:58:45
Sure, that's what is always the reason. But all at once?? This shit is lame.
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:55:44
Who is this sad, uneducated zombie trying to tell others what to do now?
@_date: 2018-03-19 11:14:34
Buying is taking place in anticipation of the G20 results.  With good news,  we'll easily break $10k again.  With bad news,  this will bottom out around $5k. Glta.
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:27:04
Brace for impact. Sub $7000 will be seen today. Sorry.
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:46:47
I'm averaged around 15k with my buys. However, I have been mining daily for 4 months, so my overall average has dropped to around 9k. I'm close to getting my 3rd whole BTC. Yippee! Still holding strong. Anyone, buying into the 'Bitcoin is dead' sentiment is dead themselves...
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:10:22
Wow, that is a very poorly written article. They must really know what they're talking about.....
@_date: 2018-04-01 08:17:11
Hehehe, poor, late-night drunk bought too high. It's ok, we forgive you.
