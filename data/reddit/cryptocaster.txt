There is nothing in Jamie Dimon's portfolio that made a better ROI than bitcoin or ethereum. The only thing most cryptocurrency investors had to do was hold their investment and they would have had a better ROI than anything Jamie Dimon has to offer.
Edit: Also, my point wasn't that I know more than Jamie Dimon about economics. But if you look at his comment... he's criticizing bitcoin for being invented centrally by an enterprise and being printed out of thin air... thats exactly how the US dollar works. Did you think that the US citizens were printing US dollars? How do you criticize bitcoin for being printed out of thin air when you deal in US dollars? Further, he complained that Bitcoin is used for illicit purposes... maybe thats true in some cases, but bitcoin isn't the king currency of illicit use - that would be hands down the US dollar...
"US currency is a preferred medium of exchange for facilitating clandestine transactions, and for storing illicit and untaxed wealth. Knowledge of its location and usage is required to estimate the origins and volume of illicit transactions. These include the illegal trade in drugs, arms and human trafficking as well as the amount of 'unreported' income, that is, income not properly reported to the fiscal authorities due to noncompliance with the tax code."

Nothing officially pegs the price of the US dollar to anything. Its the champion of currencies invented out of thin air.
