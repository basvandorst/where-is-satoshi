That’s fucking amazing
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:11:52
No it’s not . It’s legal to deface a bill
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:19:42
I retract my comment after seeing most cryptos are down. Tumblers are useless. Nearly everyone knows that. BTC needs better anonymous infrastructure though for sure. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:28:30
Isn’t Segwit the bootleg version of BTC ran by “corporate moguls” if not please correct me
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:32:25
I hope you’re trolling. I see so many people fall victim to these scams and it turns them off from bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:20:46
I think it’s funny all these people are saying they’re actively working in killing bitcoin, yet they still sell it and are one of the biggest and easiest exchanges to use
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:12:35
No it’s not. What about the where’s Waldo stamps you fucking idiot
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:46:21
That’s the reason the market crashed so they could buy in. It’s being manipulated obviously 
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:40:55
Haha i don’t know about that . But i just thought it was an interesting topic 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:54:06
Wrong. Bitcoin is traceable, with the right people. (FBI) just look at all the DNM kingpins who got caught
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:33:02
Well if you want too look at it this way: 
The Bible talks about a one world currency.
What’s the first thing that comes to your mind? Disregarding alt coins
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:01:55
Drugs , drug products , oh... did i say drugs? Resell them triple the value and boooom do it all over again
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:01:52
I wouldn’t call that a truck. But whatever . More like a Jeep. And damn I’m surprised he got out of that
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:44:10
No friend it doesn’t work like that
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:47:09
What these scams are, they take your money, create a false return, and not let you withdraw the return. Like i said i hope you’re trolling. Do NOT invest in these sites

Although you are right. I feel like they should update their price 5 seconds or 10 seconds more than they usually do
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:46:11
I think you can do that by buying via Bank and not debit card . Never tried it though
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:09:53
10 and i still stand by my comment. Fuck the IRS. They’re Useless. All our tax money goes forwards stupid shit and rich people. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:50:41
2nd option ... $$$$$
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:08:38
Definitely. Not sure if i want to buy or not maybe it’ll dip more
*fingers crossed*
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:29:48
After the dip i feel like it will go back up to around 20k-25k and sustain. This will take roughly a month. All speculation though of course . No one really knows
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:11:40
How would i invest in their fun token?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:50:21
Btc isn’t actually traded? The fuck do you mean? It’s traded by thousands every day
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:35:33
Sorry i was just repeating what someone else said. Not sure what time zone so that renders my comment completely useless but I’m sure a google search will yield the information you need.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:33:53
NICE! To the moon
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:59:22
That’s actually pretty interesting. Not sure how effective. But a family member of mine was hypnotized to bring back her childhood abuse memories she forgot and was wondering why she was so hurt and it worked. Not sure if I️ would have wanted to remembered though
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:02:09
Buy drugs with it, flip those drugs for a hell of a profit, and slowly deposit low amounts into your bank account , pay the taxes on your income from your job , done. “What bitcoin? I don’t know what that is”
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:18:36
I️ mean. What can you do other than bitch about it? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:34:55
Mine was instant. I had to do it four times for it to go through though. Bank kept canceling it but on the fourth try it went through. Although transferring to my other wallet has taken hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:15:08
Probably the stolen ones from the raid that happened when they first began to sell

@_date: 2017-12-08 04:38:43
BOA does actually 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:34:02
PLEASE don’t do that . Even if you trust him with 100% positivity he won’t steal your bitcoin. He probably will. Don’t let him touch Your shit
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:47:09
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:31:26
good try. Didn’t even post pics or verification that’s sad
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:28:10
Pass. The corporate manipulators that created BCH have no interest in us
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:55:07
Just like there is tax on everything. Someone has to make money for their time. Get on somewhere
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:24:17
How did you lose money on paxful ? It’s basically impossible unless you messed up yourself 
i . E: not using a reputable vendor
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:34:28
Fuck man. All these people buying lambos  All i want is a nismo GTR.

Sell half , get back your initial investment . Then keep the other. Rinse and repeat 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:41:04
Shit who wouldn’t. We’d all be rich
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:50:04
Well look at you!!! You’re one step ahead! Maybe you can change the IOS game , assuming you own an iPhone. get to coding swift and change the game for us. Make sure to send me a bitcoin for the recommendation 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:19:18
Not so much quickly . As it’s “free money”  who wouldn’t want free money
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:57:57
mBtc? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:14:19
All irrelevant . They need to put our tax payer money into creating jobs and affordable health care. We’ve had rodes for hundreds of years 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:45:24
Mycelium i have used for years. It also shows you how much BTC you would have had if you saved till today it’s pretty good also it’s for android too I️m pretty sure
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:22:00
Just tried setting up an account they’re having ID verification issues. Sucks to suck. Hopefully they get it fixed ASAP . Always had issues with them which I️s why I’ve never used them 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:59:21
Seriously though , what purpose do they serve other than stealing our money and returning it at a fraction of what they stole?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:08:55
No. Lol. And also it takes like 10 mins once you’re at Walmart assuming there isn’t a line. Or they have online Kiosks at some different stores. Google “moneygram kiosks near me”. It’s very easy man. Go to paxful create an account and search “any payment” and see which ones have the lowest fees
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:51:43
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:11:39
Way over that friend. It’s at 17k now. It increased like 4,000 in 2 months 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:44:38
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:41:00
.90 on the dollar for transactions over 200 last time I️ checked. They have tons of methods to pay though. Surely you can find one that fits you. Moneygram is a money transfer service , you can go to your local Walmart, hand the cashier 200 dollars, tell them the name of the person and state to send it to, they receive the funds and you get your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:37:35
I’ve used IOS mycelium for years and never had any problems 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:13:37
i am trying to buy more aswell. Been a part of bitcoin as of 2014, wish i would have bought more. Never used Coinbase because of the amount of scam reports but seems like they’ve fixed their shit. And i finally decided to try to use it tonight, they locked me out for 24 hours for trying to confirm my identity. Extremely disappointed.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:18:14
Everyone is talking about it. Just scroll down and pick your choosing ? It’s sad actually but maybe lightning will fix it

I have $200 invested i bought at 10,000ish, I plan on investing more on the dip. Which seems to be coming between today and tomorrow hopefully and then in my opinion it will skyrocket back up
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:32:10
Not sure what you’re talking about . 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:54:03
WAIT till tomorrow please do not buy right now
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:47:57
That’s actually not a bad idea. McDonald’s here i come
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:56:44

Whoah man . Better hodl so you can get that Koenigsegg next
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:37:39
Just tried again. Confirmed. Without verifying my SSN and other info. Not sure why they canceled my order the first four times as I️ had my bank account and ID already linked
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:20:47
Depending on the way you look at it, i use it for all of those things.
Assuming you’re talking about cocaine , no. I’ve never done coke and don’t plan on it. Thanks for the insight friend. I understand where you’re coming from . It needs to be adopted by major companies to move forward. But maybe it will be eventually. Until then i will use my bitcoin transactions wherever possible , which usually tends to be small businesses or peer to peer
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:09:46
Bitcoin is dropping on Coinbase right now. I suggest buying for tomorrow
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:45:40
He wants all the bitcoin , Kraken has. Of course
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:40:30
True that. I read the thread totally wrong. Thanks for the heads up
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:00:28
Yeah that’s a lie sorry. 99% of our taxes go torwards bullshit that will never help the average citizen

@_date: 2017-12-08 22:22:54
How much bitcoin do you have...

@_date: 2017-12-09 02:41:33

Yeah sure . Keep believing that. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:19:42
Fuck the IRS
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:41:11
Yea i bought $100 at 16.3 but ain’t even mad
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:36:28
Use paxful or localbitcoins. I️ have always used moneygram paxful. 200 dollars + but the fees will get you. If you want btc under 18 you gotta pay the price though
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:56:51
It rose 10,000 a day for the past few days 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:02:39
If only. I’d be trolling the fuck out of them. No money for you just my bitcoins . 
*rolls up to ATM, withdraws 2 bitcoins”
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:55:36
Which site lets you do such a low amount
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:40:26
Coinbase. Your statement is flawed. There’s tons of APPs that do what you ask for.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:06:54
They locked me out for 24 hours for trying again fuck man why not just put an hour lockout that’s retarded as fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:07:42
Its because there are so many transactions backed up on the block chain. Lightning should fix this problem but really all you can do is wait .
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:20:53

@_date: 2017-12-08 02:10:23
We could only hope . Lol more money for us. Everyone make bots to spread the word of bitcoin. I ain’t even mad
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:52:26
No... it doesn’t ... it’s just when you buy from Coinbase they have so many transactions they can’t keep up
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:05:39
You’re wrong sorry
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:17:49
Yeah you’re the stupid one. I use BTC for transactions all the time. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:45:43
It’s because by the time bitcoin skyrockets Warren Buffet will likely be dead

ViaBTC is the only site with a "working" transaction accelerator also . Can anyone ELI5 how they are able to over ride the block chain 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:57:40
Ahh okay thank you , I use it when block chain is backed up , pretty cool
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:59:57
Coinbase is one of the worse to use right now. Do NOT use them
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:52:13
Yeah. It will. Then it’ll hit 10,000 before it crashes like the Great Depression.

@_date: 2017-11-07 16:52:43
Alpha bay?

The fuck is kakao 
@_date: 2017-09-11 03:30:49
It doesn't look bad . Personally, I would wear one with no writing on it and just the bitcoin symbol covering 50-60% of the front
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:35:45
Something along the lines of this. But for "advertising" bitcoin , then the writing would be more beneficial as people who don't know what bitcoins is , would not know the logo . So I'm stuck in between the writing and the logo.
Maybe throw the "Bitcoin" writing on the back and logo on the front? I like the black shirt , not so much the white . 
Again, this is my personal opinion. Much luck to you my friend .

@_date: 2016-10-27 17:26:47
United States sorry for not specifying that's pretty important lol
And thanks for your reply. I will look into that. 
Edit:  
Found a store near me hopefully everything goes smoothly . 
Installed mycelium also and it is way better than any of the other IOS apps i tried thank you very much for that recommendation because i tried them all it felt like
