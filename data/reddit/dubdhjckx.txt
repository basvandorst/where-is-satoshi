Am I the only one yelling "KEEP YOUR SEED" at the television through this episode?

It's likely that GDAX can't find enough info to confirm you via public records. This is my problem (age 20)

No I can only assume that doing stuff like having utility payments in my name and building credit history well fix it but nothing is instant

what's your age?

I'm trying to get my BTC from electrum to coinbase so I can go back to USD. Trying to recover my principal from some Nitro wagers. 
It took $5.45 for a half hour confirmation wait. This just seems steep is all I'm trying to say. I was using dynamic fees. Is the typical price I have to pay for this type of transaction?

Thanks for not helping

Yeah I know a guy who's been using coinbase for years to gamble at Nitro and using instant deposits and withdrawals and he's losing 15% of what he could have to fees. Thanks to the great folks here I know to use an exchange with much lower fees as long as I can plan in advance

Thank you for your help. Off topic I've got to get away from coinbase. Awful fees. Can't figure out why the PayPal fee is said to be 3.99% and bank account is 1.49% and yet it shows up as a $2.99 fee no matter what I use

I help myself by letting people help me on reddit. Isn't that the point of reddit?  I do plenty of reading and DD but nothing helps more than asking and receiving a specific answer to my specific question.
