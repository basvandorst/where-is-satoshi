Oh yeah, so users don't even have to have a channel right?! Exchanges keep channels open between each other and you can use them to move coins. I didn't consider this, that would free up a huge amount of block space (based on my own experience). I'm always flipping coins between exchanges.
I had only really considered merchant purchasers before. Which I still think it will be useful for but at the moment I don't do (I used to) because of the fees.

Given other large exchanges have already implemented batching and segwit it should not take that long. 
There is also a financial incentive for coinbase to do this. I just can't understand  why they are delaying its hurting their investors which they should care about even if they don't care about the community.
I did a withdrawal from bitstamp yesterday.  
The weight is 28731 for 79 outputs (but one will be change) or around 368 weight units per output. A typical Coinbase withdrawal will have weight of 900 with only one output (the second is change). Fees are paid by weight now so they are paying 240% on fees and using 240% more block space than needed.
Someone please check my math that seems even worse than I thought. With free withdrawals from GDAX coinbase are funding this spam and it really looks like a corporate spam attack to me. Whether its deliberate or just lazy/incompetent I don't know but it's unfortunate market forces haven't resolved this. It's good to see more community pressure and it needs to continue.

Thank you for your comments.
You, along with many others, expressed concern on section 8.1.2.
To help foster a full transparency approach on the editing of this section, I am sending the revised section to you for further comment.
 
8.1.2      Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
In 2017, Bitcoin users adopted an improvement proposal for Segregated Witness (known as SegWit, where transactions are split into two segments: transactional data, and signature data) through a soft fork. SegWit made it possible to store transactional data in a more compact form while maintaining backwards compatibility.  However, a group of users had different opinions on how Bitcoin should evolve – and developed a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain titled Bitcoin Cash. Rather than implementing the SegWit changes, the developers of Bitcoin Cash decided to simply increase the blocksize. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

I know the address starts with a 3 but I don't think it's segwit.
Some other type of p2sh transaction which probably also increases transaction size.

Running the miner for a day doesn't necessarily mean anything. Its highly unlikely you would have found a block (50 btc at the time) so probably nothing happened. If you pool mined you might have found part of a block but you have to transfer from the pool to your wallet so unless you remember doing that you probably have nothing, sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:57:50
I'm also Australian. Free transfers from GDAX as has been mentioned.
Trezor uses segwit by default (address with a '3'), you can use legacy as well but there is no reason to. I don't have a ledger but I think they have segwit as well.
When you transfer from trezor or segwit there will be a fee but you set the fee. Learn how to do this properly. Too low it won't confirm for a long time, too high you are throwing away money.
As far as withdrawing money in Australia I have found coinjar to be particularly painless up to $10,000 a day. If you want more then btcmarkets is probably the largest exchange in Australia.

I don't think I fully grasp your perspective (which seems different to most people). Are you saying that because we can divide bitcoin up there is no limit to the amount of people who can have bitcoin? That would be correct although they would all have very small amounts, maybe 0.001 of a bitcoin. 
That doesn't mean there is an infinite number of full bitcoins but it would mean that bitcoin could be divided amongst infinite people. So each full bitcoin remains just as rare but there is no limit to the amount of people who could have access to some bitcoins.
Note: I am ignoring the fact bitcoin can only actually be divided down to 1 / 100,000,000 which you have now discovered as I don't think that really is the part of your perspective and it is something that might be changed in the future to increase divisibility ion the future.

It is probably worth it if there is any significant amount of bitcoin in there. You won't need the seed if you have the actual wallet file. 
If you did have the seed you wouldn't need the wallet file. The seeds are a way to generate the wallet which is also easy to write down and back up offline.
If the wallet has been encrypted you will need the password, or at least be able to brute force it with your current knowledge.

You did get something in return for it though. Your obligation to repay a debt is gone. I think a lot of people are overlooking this. I'm from Australia so I'm not confident on the answer for the U.S. but certainly in Australia you would be paying capital gains on the amount the difference between your buy price and the amount the debt was reduced by.

Try to think about it this way, you have around $800,000 now not invested in anything. How much do you want to put into Bitcoin? 
Probably not all of it.... sell down to the amount you want to invest at the moment. Personally I don't want more than 30% net worth in crypto but different people have different tolerances. Many wouldn't go over 5% some are happy with 90%.

I think cashing out some or most is sensible depending on the gains but stick with a balanced investment plan. If you invested 5% of your assets in bitcoin and now its 50% then sell down and rebalance so you only have 5% again.

If you expect the profits from growth only you will do better by buying.
Unless you can produce coins more cheaply than buying them, just buy. Access to cheap electricity is a major factor to do this. Without that you really can't win, doesn't matter which coin you want to mine.

The first article means your own tax position is not altered (in relation to GST and income tax) by buying goods with BTC. The Seller may or may not be required to pay GST (which they will add to the price). I think they say this because if you spend BTC you are treated as 'selling' the BTC to the person selling you the goods which could make you liable to pay GST. You are not liable though because of the second article.
The second one refers to when you buy BTC itself. Previously the Seller may have had to have paid GST on that transaction (and would have passed along the cost to you, bumping up the price of BTC by 10% over other countries). This has been removed and there is no GST for purchasing Bitcoin transactions.
Usually when you sell or trade BTC and gains will be CGT taxed, but some personals transactions are exempt. When this applies is likely to be complex and depend on individual circumstances.
Maybe read some of the ATO private rulings.  and do a search for bitcoin

Any update on whether this works? Would be interested in trying the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:14:40
I think you still misunderstand something slightly because even if bitcoin could be divided infinitely it would not be inflationary. 
e.g. if I own 210,000 bitcoins (I wish!) I will always have at least 1% of the total bitcoins. Other people dividing their bitcoins up has no impact on that and there will never be any more than 21M total bitcoin. Hence no inflation. There will inevitably be deflation as other people lose their bitcoins so the real total is less than 21M. No one can ever print more bitcoin than 21M and so no one can cause hyper-inflation or dilute my share of the currency.
This is different to US Dollars where even if I had 1% of all US Dollars more are printed every year in increasing amounts and so if I just hold on to them I own a smaller and smaller percentage of the total dollars and eventually my percentage would be so minuscule it is worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:49:59
Great post. Would love to know which coins you mainly sold down or was it an equal ratio of all of them?
Also it surprises me you would have 4M networth and choose to pay down your mortgage. Obviously I don't know your asset allocations or portfolio and if its all tied up in a business well fair enough. Otherwise though I would have guessed you would either be in the camp of people to pay it down earlier for the sake of owning your own home or you would be in the camp of people who feel that money is better invested elsewhere.

The average time is 10 minutes if you paid enough fees to get in the next block. If you didn't you have to wait for the network to process people who are paying more than you. When will that be? No one knows. depends how much others are willing to pay.

I have used coinjar even with the fees they are fairly competitive with other options available to Australia. The cheapest seems to usually be coinbase.com even with a 4% fee their rates are still usually better but you can't buy much. This all varies from day to day and unless you are trading won't really matter, if you just buy and hold the differences are minimal compared to bitcoins volatility. Other options include btcmarkets, independent reserve and acx.io to name a few. They each have their own use cases.
For your second point. Do not leave your coins on the exchange. Exchanges go broke or get hacked and you lose your coins. Get a hardware wallet if you plan to move your coins much or else learn how to setup a paper wallet if you just want to buy and hold. I use a Trezor. Ledger is also commonly recommended.

When using blockchain data how do you tell if a transaction is economic or not?
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:30:58
Yes, but I believe what OP is saying is that if bitcoin takes over as the main currency then USD effectively becomes worthless. There would be massive hyper inflation as everyone tries to get rid of their USD and buy bitcoin. Inflation makes a loan easier to pay off because the value of each dollar is lower (if the loan isn't fixed interest there may be no difference because interest rates on USD would skyrocket while the currency is inflating).
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:36:01
Comparing to cash, Gemini is like a bank (they are also an exchange but just for the purposes of holding bitcoin I'll ignore that) and Electrum is like a safe. 
Usually with cash its pretty safe to trust a bank. Even if they get robbed you still get your money back.  But with bitcoin all the banks are new and not well trusted yet. A lot of banks have gone broke (Mt Gox). If you leave your money in the bank the bank might go broke and you won't get your bitcoin back. If you put your bitcoin in your safe this can't happen because its yours and it doesn't matter who goes broke. 
However, make sure you don't forget the combination to your safe (losing your password/private key) and avoid burglars (malware/hackers getting your private key).

While the sentiment and post title might be correct I don't think I agree with your numbers. I assume you did $700 * ~16,000,000 to get the 11 billion dollar figure. If so that is not accurate. In order for the market to go up $700 all it takes is for the order books be bought up between $18,300 and $19,000. That figure will be significantly less than $11 billion of trade (unless every coin in existence is on the market, a huge proportion are not). The exact figure changes all the time.

Starting to do some digging into that transaction. 
Oldest block was mined 2010-01-25 14:03:24 (36297)
Newest block was mined 2010-01-31 02:42:28 (37356)
That's a 1059 block difference to mine their 60 blocks. So at the time they had 18% of the network hashrate.

Satoshi was still mining at this point, I don't know if they are his. Some people seem to have made pretty good guesses at who early coins belonged to. This is still early enough someone could probably have a pretty good guess.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:55:14
Yeah that transaction does sit at the top of the block but its sat/byte fee rate is lower than most of the others in the block so I assume it was a deliberate choice rather than an accident. And it wouldn't really make a difference anyway to breaching that 1:1 fee:reward ratio. Certainly not like say block 409008 where a single 291 BTC fee screams mistake.
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:18:49
No don't do that. You need to import the private key into a wallet first and then you send the money to the exchange. The Exchange will have a process to 'deposit' bitcoin which will generate an address, you send the bitcoin to that address from your wallet.
36 Characters is weird for a private key, most re in WIF format which is ~50 characters.
I would download mycelium (android) and try to import the key. It can import most private keys. If it doesn't work you will need to try find out what format the private key is in.

@_date: 2017-11-13 01:08:43
Its certainly causing a lot of angst at the moment. I think its a bit too early to be at this level of fees compared to block.
People will see it in different ways and the answer differs depending on a short and long term perspective. It clearly affects practicality for a lot users right now, which is awful. On the other hand it seems an effective way to help drive miners back onto the chain which is helping. 
So my answer would be its not a 'good' thing for users now but I think what is happening does show that the bitcoin consensus rules are sound and will help bitcoin weather these storms created by abrupt changes in hash power, that's good.
I'm interested to see how things hold up long term when fees dominate compared to miner rewards more often in the future. I think that will be a whole new world of economics and consensus. I'm not really looking forward to it, as I think it will be pretty rough initially, but its something bitcoin will have to transition to in the long term to make sure it honors limited supply to sustain its value.
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:22:02
electrum is a good choice
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:26:28
Well all inputs to a transaction have to be spent, anything unspent goes to the miner. Sometimes you have a single large input and you only wish to send a small amount of it so what do you do?
A good quality wallet should take care of this for you by generating a change address, making that an additional output and making sure you assign the amount intended to change and fees. 
The stuff up occurs when people are using wallets with poor GUIs or ones with manual fee or output allocations and they stuff up. The usual story is 'oops I entered my fee into the sending amount and my sending amount into the fee'. This is why a lot of wallets don't like to let users manually enter a fee and prefer some sort of autoselection. It means users lose some control over setting fees (and complain when suggested fees are higher than need be) but it prevents big mistakes by users.
With ledger and most modern wallets you shouldn't have a problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:48:34
I have no doubt that a lot of coin movement at the moment is people trying to liquidate holdings (this particular block doesn't fit that pattern as it seems to have very low Coin Days Destroyed, not sure why). It would be expected that the first block of this nature would occur during a rush to move coins. 
Even though the users don't like it they are supporting the network with their fees, higher fees drives miners to work on the chain. In my opinion at 12.5 btc per block it is too early to have a fee to reward ratio above 1 and it probably is not sustainable. The next halving will be interesting though as fees will start to regularly dominate compared to block reward. This is something that is necessary long term but the timing of that transition from reward to fees is obviously very controversial.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:52:08
All good advice and very carefully framed. My one nitpick is that I think that $100k-$250k would not imply that fiat is becoming worthless or the prevailing economic regime has completely fallen apart. That's only a ~2 Trillion Market Cap still far less than gold and the rise of gold certainly hasn't made fiat worthless. I think you would be talking a price of well over $1M before you are really seeing any real loss of trust in fiat having an impact of the exchange rate.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:06:49
There have been previous cases where the fees were greater than the block reward but all of these appear to be some poor soul accidentally transposing their mining fee and output. This doesn't appear to be the case here.
In the long term bitcoin mining will need to be supported by user fees as the block reward is halved.
I know people are a bit grumpy with the high fees at the moment and I think this is an early outlier. Still it is a sign that the network has enough value for users to support it rather than just through inflation.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:42:52
Excellent point, I guess we haven't had a standard block with more transaction fees than the reward yet. There were others that were close like 494060 but none broke 12.5.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:43:06
Yeah its a bit rich for me at the moment as well, there is clearly plenty of demand though. I wish I could have invested in blockchain space, now that would have been a crazy ride.
With so many inputs this is where Schnorr signatures would shine. Probably would have saved about 6kb of block chain space or about $500 at the time of this transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:17:12
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:05:34
This is called arbitrage. There are risks involved in the way you propose, mostly that the price changes before you complete the transfer and transaction. You also didn't account for moving the cash back Gemini and the time this would take.
My suggestion would be have money and coins on a few exchanges, so you can make your trades at the same time, reduces the risk of the market moving and you losing your arbitrage. Then move the coins and money back to reset to starting position and repeat once they arrive. 
The trick with arbitrage is accounting for the fees in exchanging and moving and well as the time factor. Also keep in mind that this strategy requires keeping coins and cash on exchanges which long term involves the risk of exchanges going bankrupt.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:36:09
Yeah the 30 at a time seems a little low to me. There is a limit though, they can't stick everything in. At the moment a 30 input consolidation is about 9kb. Can't go too high or the transactions won't fit in a block or will be left out when the block is nearly full. Still ramping it up to 300 or 90kb might make it a little bit more efficient on fees, probably not a big difference though.
In Feb there have been 16,000 transactions with exactly 30 inputs. These won't all be theirs but I think the majority would be. That's 144 mb of consolidations so far.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:53:39
Yep, probably not spam. Seems to be someone taking advantage of the low fees to consolidate a huge amount of outputs. All the transactions are 30 inputs to 1 output. Probably an exchange doing this.
It doesn't look spammy to me at all, there is genuinely huge amounts of coins moving and the UTXO set is dropping.
@_date: 2018-02-22 06:08:22
You will soon, the mempool just completely emptied!
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:32:41
The weight is still less than a standard transaction, 700 &lt; 760 (192 * 4). This means there is still a fee saving and I think a 1 to 1 is the worst case scenario for segwit, but I could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:20:57
I know the feeling. I have started to download the entire blockchain again due to some corruption. Monthly quota is only 100GB so I'm going to need to spread the download over a couple of months. If this happens again I think I will just move to an  SPV wallet.

0 fees are a valid transaction but I believe that most nodes are set by default to reject transactions with less than 1 sat/b so it may be very difficult to get such a transaction mined even if the mempool is empty.

@_date: 2018-02-22 02:36:18
Coinbase is one of the likely candidates. We could be pretty certain if someone with a coinbase deposit has had the output swept up in a 30 to 1 consolidation. Unfortunately I've never deposited to coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:35:12
I agree, except GDAX will pay the fees for Coinbase customers. So Coinbase have plenty of incentive to optimise. I have no idea why they still seem so incompetent.
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:14:14
I've never had one of these but my understanding was the only on chain transactions were when you deposited or withdrew bitcoin from the card. Any spending at the shops was an off chain transaction.
So even though this would have lowered transaction volume I don't think it would be a huge amount as people probably only top up the cards one every few weeks or months.

Just work out how much money you have received from the Bitcoin Cash fork, say it's $1,000. Then ask yourself if I had $1,000 in my bank account would I buy Bitcoin Cash? If you would then keep it. If you wouldn't sell it and use that money for what you would really prefer to do.
I have sold all sorts of forked coins after asking myself that question. Most of them I would never have invested a single cent into so what is stopping me using that money for something else? Usually it's only inertia that stops people selling.

Brute forcing is your only option. This may help,

Most aren't segwit but some other form of P2SH. You can tell by checking the spend scripts or just by the fact that they are older than segwit activiation (OK that doesn't strictly preclude them from being segwit but it is a pretty good bet).
