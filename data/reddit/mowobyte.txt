Thats right. But bigger blocks are no solution for scaling with more Transactions on the chain. Blocks will always be filled no matter how big the block is.

THIS is not about profitability, its a choice.
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:02:06
I think everyone who has non profitable ASICS in the closet knows that. I appreciate this participation.
Its like saying "i am not going to vote because i am just one voice. nobody cares about it", now the US has Trump. Congratz! *Please do not argue about this comparison, i know there are dozens of other reasons for the outcome of the US election.

not brave enough for 1.000.000? ;)
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:40:49
i'm with you.
i believe in Bitcoin as a pure instrument of democracy. That i'm getting more financial value is nice but not my priority. Addicted since 2011!
@_date: 2018-04-13 08:49:10
...or lose money ;)
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:45:31
yes: to the moon!
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:56:51
No no no. Maybe i didnt point that out.
I dont think the risk is higher now that the price drops instead i also noticed for myself that Bitcoin evolved a lot since the mtgox incident.
I can do the math you describe and i totally agree with your last paragraph.
But for someone who isnt into stocks or especially Bitcoin its not that easy to make clear that it is possible to invest 1000$ instead of buying exact 1 Bitcoin and that this isnt the goal in acquiring Bitcoins. The people i talk to only see the price 1 BTC/USD and compare it to the past where 1 BTC was 20 $ or so. When this goes to 10 $ it doesnt hurt them but when 1500 $ goes down to 750 $ it hurts really bad.
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:57:05
People who didnt know the things you mentioned wont get why Bitcoin can be the solution or better than this.
Someone who will understand it is smart enough to buy Bitcoins by himself.
I dont see high risk that Bitcoin will "crash" to zero. I think its relatively stable at this moment.
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:39:32
Fear and Risk.
Bitcoin is a rollercoaster. When i am pointing out to friends and other people that Bitcoin can crash its because they are investing now, not when it was 100$ or 10$. And the possibility that it falls below 1400$ or 1000$ is real and they would lose a lot of money. Its a longterm investment, you have to hodl.
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:53:15
Giving an investment advice to friends isnt a smart idea.
Explaining Bitcoin to them is a totally different thing. If they then unerstand what all this means and they want to buy some Bitcoin its there own decision
@_date: 2017-05-05 11:45:51
Oh i never advice someone to invest in Bitcoin. I Always try to explain the whole idea of Bitcoin. But of course the price increase over last years is the thing everyone is paying most attention.
