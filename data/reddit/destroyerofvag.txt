The 500$ aren't any money I'm gonna miss since I don't need them right now or in the future. That being said, I honestly wouldn't care too much if I never got to see those money again since this is basically gambling (sorry for oversimplifying). So my risk tolerance is pretty high.
I think I will go ahead and buy as soon as I'm 100% sure of a site that won't screw me over.
Thanks for replying and not being as hostile or butthurt as some of the other replies were (:

First of all, thanks for the answer! It's nice to get an actual personal reply, since i don't know anyone in person who knows that much about Bitcoin.
I don't know enough about bitcoin and the math and economics to actually believe in it **yet**, but I do however find the whole thing very intriguing and exciting.
I'm based in Denmark, so I've been told that  is the easiest place to buy for me.
I'm thinking (and remember this was only a thought) that since Bitcoin is being brought up on national news, social networks and so on at an incredible rate since the start of November, that a lot of people will buy in to the whole thing. So if i understood everything correctly, that will make the Bitcoin price go up. So if i invest my money in it now, I should be able to sell them again (within 2-3 years) and make some money off it, right?

Did it really bother you that much to see this post? 
Since I'm new to the whole thing, it does feel quite overwhelming, so it's nice to get an actual personal reply from someone and even maybe get a conversation going compared to reading FAQs with words of economy and IT that I can't grasp.
