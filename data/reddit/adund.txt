Lol 1500 BTC in one buy in bitifinex is natural rise

Nah, I prefer to fight the good fight with my keyboard and mouse. Nodes cost much more money in terms of electricity and internet bandwidth and hardware that I have to buy with filthy government money. If there was a way I could generate electricity from my cats maybe I would consider it. The hell, I could patent it and even mine some more internet money to buy stuff

Your user name is the legendary Persian king Cyrus, and you badmouth Iran? Oh the irony!

I have, many other are warming up. Recently it was made illegal to hold more than 10000 USD in cash. You can guess what alternatives people are now buying

Because when grandpa is dying you don't mention tubes and ventilators out of respect. "Oh he is dying but he is hooked up to these machines that will help him to go a little longer!" That's just rude

Lol dream on on your over glorified poker chip

For short term sure. I do it myself but I don't get attached to my investment. I do it to increase my position. Fanboyism is not my cup of tea.

Yes, although we pay a premium of at least 10% but no taxes on any gains or trade. Most of it is OTC, some out of country based websites provide crypto with our debit cards. Government seems not so keen on cracking down on crypto for now. Blockchain workshops are officially held and a bank is working on a cryptocurrency (Post Bank).

I trade, I don't get attached to these pipe dreams. When blockchain is actually mainstream then I will invest. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:21:44
I do my research, I get involved in the communities to better only invest short term for profit and increase my position. Yeah I don't qualify for your boy scout fan club kid. I have unbiased opinion, not a popular thing in any condition. We human love our cognitive biases, it gives us a sense of security and comfort.

So they control the media, the money, the banks, the general public, the military. We have our internet moneys. Fight on brothers! Keyboards to arms!

I didn't say cryptocurrency was invalid. Speculation in them is. No one likes governments, but they are not aliens they're just humans, it's human nature to be greedy. Cryptocurrency is not an exception. BTC and market manipulation, scams, shitcoins and etc. Is this really an improvement over the old system? We need someone to protect us from ourselves, but we also hate that.
