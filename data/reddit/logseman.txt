It's rather surprising to read an entire text about the ephemeral nature of "subcultures/urban tribes" without the notion that makes sense of the entire chain: the lifecycle of a product. The New Thing is a creative product generated in the market, not a haphazard collection of loosely integrated ideas from "creators".

5 of those are mine. I grew more interested in the block chain for other uses, but...

They don’t have to be smart anyways since they can use civil forfeiture.

I regret not holding on to my hard drive with 5 of these. It's not retirement money, but it'd make some decisions a bit easier to take.

That graffitti has been changed to everything. in fact, the first google hits actually feature a flower bunch.
It is more important to translate it into Greek.

Anyone with a significant amount of money has already put their funds in a safe place.

It makes sense that you have a more invested community when there's money involved.

That's lazy, elitist design going on there. That a program is open sourced doesn't mean it's got to be poorly designed.

What I meant is that many leading open source projects are designed in a way that assumes lots of knowledge from the user, that is, they're designed for people in the sane wavelength as the developers. That's why I meant it's an elitist design. The obsession with customization does also detract from a coherent design vision.

Well, actually things are not getting worse anywhere. Extreme poverty even in the least developed countries is not greater than before, extreme undernutrition is happening less than before, child mortality is falling immensely in the low-income countries and life expectancies are rising...
And much of that can be attributed to the fact that, for example, everyone in the world has access to a way of asking for help, because mobile phones are truly ubiquitous.

There's no such thing as "destroy confidence forever". People investing in China know that the official numbers are bogus and have been for a long time, and that hasn't prevented China from soaking up foreign investment like a sponge.

Meanwhile, the most successful business in recent history provides products that are mass produced through a fantastically large logistic chain and are barely customizable; it deems itself in a position where it can dictate customers' needs, not adapt to them, and brings it to them with the help of a giant marketing apparatus.
Learn the right lessons, or you'll get everything backwards.

Unless they're mandated to, that is.

He better makes it clear when he tells them something starting with "while".

Isn't the entire point of the Linux distros and the altcoins to have no one in charge from a central throne?

In the EU that's the legal doctrine: the service is rendered where the customer is.

I bought 5 in 2010 but I lost the wallet. If I checked the value actively I'd drive myself mad.

Its not a problem of volatility, but liquidity. What good does a 10 bitcoin donation do if you can’t use it?

And so we learnt about the expected value and the diminishing marginal utility in one comment. Congrats, all of you who read this, because now you can take an Econ course.
