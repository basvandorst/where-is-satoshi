Actually in the way OP said it is just fine and give him a fucking break english isn't his first language. You think you're so fucking witty finding some nuance in reddit tittle. Down vote for being a shitbag.

I was just wondering what your thoughts were after making such an investment that didn't live up to your predictions :D
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:26:52
Much more then a few bumps. Every single account of the largest and most popular by a huge margin had it's entire accounts and passwords spread across all of the internets. 
@_date: 2011-06-12 20:26:33
This. Until the value stabilizes there's going to be very few people buying services and goods with it. Why should I spend my 200$ of bitcoins when they might be worth 300$ next week? 
@_date: 2011-06-14 20:44:23
Currency's are different though. You need people trading them for good and services for the price to stay high. If those services that use bitcoin shut down the value will plummet. What would you buy or sell bitcoins for other then dollars?  Just look what's going on right now with mt gox going down. 
I don't think they'll become illegal though. it would be like saying bittorrent is illegal. they'd have a very hard time enforcing it without adding more fuel to the fire.
Something to keep in mind. Bitcoin is international. Even if they try to shut it down in the USA it can still take over in russia, UK, and china. 
@_date: 2011-06-08 06:08:05
trying not to. Sold some for 22 yesterday then bought some for 19 earlier today. Sure is a lot easier selling them then it is buying them.

Have 2 MSI 6950s great for mining and gaming. If bitcoin crashes and you need to sell your card there will still be a market for it. Just make sure you get one that can be unlocked before you buy it if that's something you're interested in doing. 
@_date: 2011-06-09 18:30:49
Based on the comments here it really seems not a lot of people actually read the entire OP. Which either indicates denial or lack of comprehension...

....even more reason for stores not to accept it. "Hey that money from the order we sent out on Friday is worth half as much today" Who would do business like that?
The bitcon economy isn't real **YET**, it will be eventually. Everyone's using now it to make a quick buck or horde while having delusional fantasies of it hitting 1,000$ and being a bitcoin billionaire.

@_date: 2011-06-14 00:42:13

Wow, kids these days are soft. It goes down from 10 to 9$ and you guys post about it? 
@_date: 2011-06-19 03:03:22

@_date: 2011-06-08 06:09:30
bitcoin has turned every techy to an economist. 
@_date: 2011-06-17 17:56:43
Yes, my outlook for a currency that's not secure, not user friendly, and has 0 economy backing it is very very pessimistic. I Sold all my bitcoins I mined on my gaming computer to someone who couldn't wait for his money to get into mtgox for 42$ each. Thanks for the free graphics cards, steam games, and extra cash! I won't be loading up on anything bitcoin related. Made my proffits while I could. 
@_date: 2011-06-15 06:06:00
It'll go up to the next high for a long time. The difficulty increase is going to be larger then anyone expects since everyone who is going to invest in mining components did last week after "the bubble" and have been running them all week. After the difficulty increase the bitcoin mining is hardly going to be covering the electricity cost. I expect a lot of buyer remorse to be posted here and people returning all there mining gear. They'll either sell their coins or hold on to them. Either way they're not adding to the economy which is looking like is going to be the fall of bitcoin. 
Either way I'm really excited for it.

The well off do have an emotional connection to money 99+% of people around the world would be pissed if 8,000 was just lost from there account. If you're emotional about your money you should be more concerned in what you invest it in. I really don't understand your point. 
@_date: 2011-06-17 19:02:39
There are plenty of these. 
I still have a few coins I'm hanging on to. I don't think bitcoin is just going to die. It's going to be around for years but the prices were so obviously inflated because of speculation and the growth wasn't stable at all. I still think the concept is really interesting and rather spend my time here having thoughtful intelligent discussions about it then looking at rage comics or something else. 
@_date: 2011-06-08 06:09:55

Wow, Ok. Silkroad isn't down people say that to calm people so they don't cause a larger dip.  Silk Road being up or down doesn't bring the price from 25 to 13. Even if it did would you want to invest in something that's price depends on an illegal sketchy website?

except if I have 500,000 in gold or dollars stolen from my bank account I can call the police or have it insured to begin with. 
I know there is an actual economy behind it but it only accounts for a small amount. The main factor behind the price of bitcoin is the speculation. The price went up 3x in less then 2 days a few weks ago. Did the economy grow 3x the size in 2 days? No. A bunch of articles came out on wired and elsewhere and every techy bought in thinking they could get rich quick. Some of them getting very screwed. 
@_date: 2011-09-10 22:16:27
Wow, lmao. 
Bitcoin didn't catch on when it had the chance to which was back in may-June. people got way to greedy since it was basically free money for just running your computer and created a bubble. 
For the past 3 month the price of bitcoin has gone down consistently and is showing no signs of ever going up. No political or socioeconomic factors have yet done anything to effect the price.  
Bitcoins are still going to be used but I don't think you'll ever see it over 10$ again. 
@_date: 2011-06-12 10:10:50

From most of what I've read the people who have gotten into bitcoin in the past 2 weeks have no idea what they're doing and are losing a lot of money they shouldn't be spending. So I wouldn't count on it. 
On another note why is my OP getting downvotes? People sour they bought coins at 30$ and 2,000$ worth of mining gear using money they don't have?
@_date: 2011-06-18 10:02:09

The next few months are going to be the most volatile in bit coin until a competitor emerges. depending on the type of media coverage it gets and such. A lot of people are buying because they think they're going to be worth a lot more and people are selling goods on the internet for bitcoins because they think itll be a better value. You all over the place. You asking about cashing out. Then you talk about converting USD to bitcoin and talking about the crash I don't know wtf youre trying to ask.

Few things. That article points out the obvious and omits important parts. First, bitcoin isn't safe. I can get 500,000$ in bitcoin stolen in the click of a button and there would be nothing I could do about it while gold you can press charges. Second, that's implying there is a actual economy behind the bitcoin price unlike what it is which is a gigantic amount of speculation. 
@_date: 2011-06-09 18:24:59
Based on the context of the article the OP the way he was saying it is fine. He/She is saying bitcoin has failed as widely accepted system of money. OP's being more specific then saying "Why bitcoin failed as an asset and is on it's way to become an asset." and saying the rest of his article is illegitimate because of that is a fallacy.

@_date: 2011-06-13 16:53:49
Because there's obviously some demand for bitcoin aside from the people are just buying and selling for USD. People have been mining for well over a year already and in the past few months has gained a ton of attention. I'm not saying bitcoin's defiantly going to be worth 100$ in 2 years but it's not going to just go away unless a better alternative comes up.

if you're not going to mine anymore put them on a USB drive and put that drive in a closet or drawer. some where were you won't forget about it for 5-10 years, could be worth a few thousand by then. who knows. don't "invest" in a mining rig. everyone and there mother is already doing it and the next difficulty increase is going to make it hardly profitable after electricity.

purchase a shit ton? no. But I'm buying 200$ worth with the money I made selling over 30$. All the pussies are out of the market now. Time for some actually growth in the bitcoin economy. Bitcoin might fizzle out now but it's not going to die forever. It very well could come back in 3, 6, 18 months.  Keep in mind some people have been mining for over a year now.
