This was not meant to be a question about the ethics of consumerism. Inflation has been questionably associated with economic growth. The definition of "useless consumer goods" will vary from person to person

I don't think that having to learn what bitcoin is and going through steps to learn how to use it is a significant enough barrier to using it as a currency. Bitcoin transfers are free. International wire transfers are expensive. Bitcoin has logarithmic inflation, whereas most currency has exponential inflation, making it a potentially valuable investing tool. 
There are three stages to any new technology: early adoption: only highly knowledgable people are even aware of the technology.
Speculative adoption: tech savvy and business minded people recognize that the technology could be profitable, drives up price and people start talking about it.
Mass adoption: household name.
I think that bitcoin is still in the speculative adoption stage. All the mining that could be done on home computers has been done. People are still buying bitcoin with the hope of further price increases. People still aren't aware it exists. I think that when people realize bitcoin's killer features it will become adopted by the masses, at least for people in the market for frequent international money transfers: a 500 billion dollar industry.

Your comment is paradoxical. If the recipients of federal spending "go shopping" Where did they spend the money, if not purchased from the producers of goods and services.

I think if bitcoin had no upper limit, but still had a logarithmic supply of bitcoins it would have more longterm viability

The difference is, a smart saver can buy government bonds or any other security really, to offset the burden of inflation on his savings. There is no mechanism in place to offset the burden of deflation for a consumer's purchases

how is bitcoin deflationary when new bitcoins are mined everyday? I mean the rate of increase slows with time, but they are always adding new bitcoins to the supply.

This is misleading, because the reason for bitcoin's appreciation in value (deflation) Is because of its increase in utility and speculative increase in potential, due to bernanke's endorsement, etc.
 The fact is, bitcoin is not the world's reserve currency. It was until this year, a niche market for tech whizzes, econ geeks, and libertarians. The massive increase in value demonstrates its massive potential to be a fundamental currency. True bitcoin deflation won't happen for a long time, at the upper limit of its [logarithmic growth](
