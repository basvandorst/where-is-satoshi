This will be known as the 2019 mini-bubble. Heading back to $5K now.
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:24:20
Massive dump.
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:11:42
They have plenty more coins to dump. There will be no Moon or Lambo.
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:28:43
Some time after February 2019 Mt.Gox is scheduled to release 170,000 Bitcoins to its ex-customers and debtors. The price will probably collapse.
@_date: 2018-08-13 06:20:05
Who even buys Bitcoin anymore these days, LMAO. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:02:41
That's funny how grossly manipulated this whole thing is. This should be illegal in any civilized country. They pump it a couple thousand, make you believe it's a good investment again, then dump millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin on you, make out like bandits and abandon the ship. 
Rinse and repeat half a year later.

More like spacecraft going down in flames
@_date: 2019-11-11 10:10:58
So we've been going down since late June (when the 2019 mini-bubble burst). 
There are occasional pumps, almost immediately followed by new lows. It is highly likely that we are going to see sub $7K Bitcoin pretty soon.
@_date: 2019-11-22 05:03:19
Dollar cost averaging all the way to zero. That's some top notch investing strategy right there :-)
@_date: 2019-11-08 20:55:27
The overall trend does not look promising.
@_date: 2019-11-13 10:34:38
No, I personally don't think it will have any real effect on the price.
Why don't those people who keep bragging about the halving take out all their credit lines and become millionaires? Sounds easy peasy, right?
@_date: 2019-11-22 05:06:01
Highly likely.
@_date: 2019-11-14 01:27:14
Well if you start talking numbers, that's more like 50%.  
BTC closed at $5,738 on Nov 13, 2018 and it's around $8,760 now.
@_date: 2019-11-12 18:41:55
The answer is NO.
@_date: 2019-11-14 00:49:08
"Steadily been doing well"? It's been steadily going down since late June, for almost half a year.

Um, a couple month ago it was almost $9K. It hasn't been $3,000 since 2017.

@_date: 2018-06-26 09:43:23
There was once a worldwide computer network called FidoNet. In early 1990s, millions of people around the world used it. But times change.
Some leftovers of it probably still exist supported by enthusiasts, but it's pretty much dead and forgotten by the general population.
@_date: 2019-08-13 07:34:16
How many years until the next mini-bubble of $15K BTC?
@_date: 2019-08-30 03:47:26
Bitcoin is so pathetic these days.
@_date: 2019-08-06 22:44:09
Sounds like an unhealthy obsession.
@_date: 2019-10-05 23:38:02
Um, how are you gonna be "successful" if you spend your money on Bitcoin and never sell it? This doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2019-10-12 14:44:51
Past performance is not indicative of future results. Those past spikes  are completely irrelevant to what is happening now. This may as well be the slow, agonizing death of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:55:32
Yeah, we've all heard it before, "buy the dip". The problem is, there has been nothing but dips for the last half a year. Let's just all agree that Bitcoin is toast. The major investors have accepted their losses and are trying to get out now. 
There might be another Bitcoin bubble in 3 or 4 years. That's the beauty of Bitcoin: it's always there, always ready for another Ponzi, once the dust settles and people get greedy again.
At this point I have personally sold everything and I will probably be buying back at $2-3k.
@_date: 2019-10-29 17:47:06
Yeah, the whales are going to pump it to the prophecy numbers, just to mess with the redditors' heads.

The boiling frog is a fable describing a frog being slowly boiled alive. The premise is that if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used as a metaphor for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of sinister threats that arise gradually rather than suddenly.
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:37:52
Yes, that would be a big mistake. The price of Bitcoin will likely gradually decline until the end of the year. Anyone expecting a new "bull run" anytime soon is just delusional.
In February 2019 Mt.Gox will release 170,000 Bitcoins to its  ex-customers and debtors which will bring another huge crash.

@_date: 2019-06-26 20:35:37

@_date: 2019-06-22 13:04:36
Sounds about right.
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:56:51
I feel sorry for people who were buying "dips" at 12k, 10k, 8k. That's top notch investment right there, lol.

No. The price will continue to drop.
@_date: 2019-06-14 14:51:11

Of course there will be another dip. That's how the whole pump and dump thing works.

Bitcoin will never reach $100,000 because everyone will start selling at $90,000 to take the profits before the collapse. The smartest people will sell at $80,000 and get away with their money :)
@_date: 2019-06-02 18:05:54
Not anytime soon

There is a huuuge amount of sell orders at 10k and above.
@_date: 2019-12-23 19:50:43
You can't really draw a line from January going up, because it's been going down for half a year.
@_date: 2019-12-18 11:18:45

@_date: 2019-12-09 13:41:42
The funny thing is, even if Bitcoins skyrockets again, you'll never be able to sell it at the new All-Time High.
There will be a few dips on the way, but you will hold and hold hoping for the lambo and moon. Then it will start to crash with a major dip, followed by a temporary dead-cat-bounce that will make you think things are getting better again. By the time you realize it's a full-blown crash, Bitcoin will lose 70% of its price and will keep going down with no hope left for the next few years.
@_date: 2019-12-10 16:27:42
Going down, as usual. If the 5-month trend continues, we will see $6K Bitcoin by early January.
@_date: 2019-12-18 11:24:20
Because there is a possibility that in a few months you will be able to get them for $25.
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:30:26
So basically you want us to send 1 BTC to some Bitcoin address for "charity". Sounds legit, LMAO.

Mt.Gox is scheduled to release 170,000 Bitcoins to its ex-customers and debtors in February 2019. That's close to $1 billlion worth of bitcoins thrown out to the market.

According to coinatmradar.com, his fees are: Buy 7-9% (tiered), Sell 2.5%.
The ATM operator's website shows slightly higher fees 
Buy Bitcoins $1-999 Spot +9.5%, $1000-$2999 Spot +7.0%
Withdraw Cash Spot -3.0% 
Spot price is from BitcoinAverage.com
@_date: 2018-07-23 14:51:20
As the article says, "though history has proven it doesn’t take much to tip the scales. One strong sell-off could still easily send Bitcoin down to $5,000, if not $3,000".
And the sell-off will happen. That's what it was all about from the beginning, when they pumped it from $6,300 to $7,300 in 1 day.
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:57:27
Here we go... A huge dump incoming
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:30:11
No one can tell you for sure. The price will definitely collapse next spring when Mt. Gox will release 170,000 Bitcoins to its ex-customers. But between now and then, anything could happen.
@_date: 2018-07-20 17:25:30
LOL. Do you need to be reminded how BTC went to almost $10,000 and fell to $5,850 just recently?
@_date: 2018-07-18 21:21:05
Well, if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck :)

Price manipulation before the ETF approval? Then moon.
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:41:04
Pretty much ZERO. No one is going to allow hardworking american families to get involved in this.
@_date: 2018-07-24 04:14:50
There is no "bull run", just some market manipulation. Somebody pumped the price from $6.2k to $7.7k.
@_date: 2018-07-20 17:35:45
This is definitely a Sucker Rally, don't get involved :)
@_date: 2018-07-18 21:14:21
Looks like an obvious manipulation. Every time the price starts to drop someone appears with a buy order for 50 or 60 bitcoins to keep it afloat. The question is, how long is this gonna last, and is this just a quick pump and dump scheme, or are thy trying to start a new bubble?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:00:53
Crash and burn.
@_date: 2018-07-30 16:32:40
How long until a spectacular crash?
@_date: 2018-07-11 00:20:48
300% gain for $2k would be $8k, not $6,300.
@_date: 2018-07-23 15:33:31
What's the importance of $7.8k? 
Remember , it went from $6.6K to $9.8k in one month back in April and then collapsed all the way down to $5.8k.
@_date: 2018-07-23 20:14:38
Market manipulation.
@_date: 2018-07-11 06:26:13
No, it's not.
In February 2019 Mt.Gox will release 170,000 Bitcoins to its ex-customers and debtors. The price will probably go down to as low as $2,000-$2,500.
@_date: 2018-07-22 22:13:16
Who knows... Someone is trying hard to stop the price from collapsing, but huge sell orders are popping up all the time
@_date: 2019-09-15 07:35:40
Sounds like an unhealthy obsession.
@_date: 2018-07-22 22:23:48
Who said "one person"? There are big powers at play.
@_date: 2018-07-27 17:15:47
Dead cat bounce.
@_date: 2018-07-17 01:07:46
Oh, the good old pump and dump. Sell your coins now!
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:43:24
Not even close.
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:43:07

@_date: 2019-05-28 10:59:53
Bitcoin can't replace any kind of currency or a micro-payment system. It's just too slow for that.
It is simply a speculative investment, and nothing else.

Another pump. It's over $9,000.
