1. rename to cryptopedia, as someone here stated.
2. make it open-source, so people can actually contribute
3. categorize terms. trading / blockchain / misc etc? so you can filter those terms 
4. two column layout?
5. i would make bigger gap between logo and the ' the urban dictionary of crypto ', maybe lessen the contrast of the motto
6. maybe add some sort of rating, so you can find out top words that people didn't know
7. add an option to collapse a letter group
8. make the search do real time filtering
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:51:40
If it would be cryptopedia + open source ( which makes sense, in crypto .... ), it could be  ! ��
fyi, i've updated the original comment

If only one of us do, we should definitely share! ��

@_date: 2017-11-16 14:58:42
eh and what happens when it gets dropped from the mempool? do i get my fee back? does it return to the original wallet?  how long until drop out/pass?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:21:47
i wanted to try to pay low, just got me worried
but thank you for the information! got me happy a lil

what do you think about this transaction? im waitin for days now and im unsure if it will pass .
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:44:39


second mistake identified. ( I mean, to me it wouldn't be enough )
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:52:44
Yes it is early, if u have money to throw at it. With 600 eur monthly you cannot do much,
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:01:38
Would be a fail. My English pronouncing is bad ��

At first I wanted to write 199x year, but then Ive changed my mind. Anywas, the point was that the income / standard of living is far ahead of ours.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:48:39
if you have to ask that question, just don't do it, anyways, is it possible to code my own crypto coin?

I feel like the US is in the 21th century - while my country is  in 2002. Our country avg salary wouldn't be enough even for that steering wheel !
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:46:38
I hope so. I need to extend my btc portfolio and I don't have that much money..
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:48:22
How stupid is this question wow
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:34:25
You shouldn't havecash them out for fiat. Imagine it's 9K to the end of the year.. The point is to hold and stack them up

@_date: 2017-11-13 07:37:08
mm, okay, i will set it up to 49 sat/b .
thanks.  :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:49:15
Yes, I do know how to do that kind of things, I was just unsure about the API thing, as I am beginner to crypto, if it even does exists. As for example, the coinbase nor blockchain api doesn't serve this purpose. but thanks! :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:10:14
Contact their support 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:44:11
would be interested in an answer too, as I have a 30 satoshi fee transaction pending for three days by now ��
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:43:24
Okay and..
Can I send input like 3500 and get the time it was firstly reached?
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:17:31
if they would educate themselves and would hold, they for SURE would invest more into it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:45:51
I will make this, but 2bitcoinjackpot ! and I'll offer 99.5% of the win! hell yea
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:53:48
lol do I really read about someone that doesn't do what is in his possibility to save up 15k $? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:38:07
Well, I hate myself for never looking at bitcoin when I was younger. It could change my life. Now I'm just chasing a fast ship without even having the tickets, 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:52:10
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:17:04
with out being too constructive, these suck. Sorry :(
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:51:22
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:58:09
yes, but it doesn't work like a collaborative hashing, your home desktop / notebook wont mine a single block, because the faster devices on farms will overtake you.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:05:54
how would one do that? i mean.. im imagining myself being at coinmarketcap.com and hovering arround to find out the timestamps. lol
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:38:32
and I'm sitting here with my 0.06 and waiting for a salary that will come in few weeks ����
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:21:46
This month I've put almost all of my 'fun money' into it and I have 0.03 BTC. Do not make me depressed plz :D
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:08:14
my advice would be to not invest all in.
Split it up, like every monday 500.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:06:22
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:43:02
its scam
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:52:39
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:01:47
That's not an issue 
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:55:13
I gave you straight answer lol
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:30:41
Thank you kind stranger
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:25:41
okay, whats your private key?
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:44:58
u send 1 bitcoin gold to address xyz 
You also sent 1 btc, but without knowing it.
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:14:50
So am I safe to go with  ?
Do I understand right, that afterwards I am supposed to go to my internet banking and make a SEPA transaction?
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:16:31
why these people keep posting at spanish/ whatever language.. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:53:06
Sell it for more. Or sell the desktop if ur not into games
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:05:00
DO YOU GUYS THINK IT WILL PEAK A LITTLE? AT LEAST TO 5 something?
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:02:09
and when the amount of hashing power increases? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:18:13
I will get the rate that is at the time (ie after) of verification, right?
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:39:58
one more question, how do i get the btg after the fork, if that address is only for bitcoins? :s
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:57:50
and I'll fork you in your nose. ��
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:25:25
Then I messed it up. Sorry 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:09:22
Find the github repository, view issues. No they haven't prepared the test and main net even. LOL
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:53:18
macOs is way better for work. ( my opinion )
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:12:28
why avoid coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:39:33
also, why its already 45 min and its not confirmed? 67 confirmations and still pending
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:56:32
i guess the error could be made only by the person that made that paper wallet. idk however i've booted live ubuntu and ran it in the offline envi
isn't that enough?
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:18:20
After (and if) they implement replay protection 
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:00:06
The fork has happened on block 491 407 , nah?
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:40:15
nevermind, can be any of the top50 :)
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:30:59
imagine it the other way, 100 folks jumping at this subreddit and posting topics in foreign languages you dont understand.. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:07:46
are u from the future or just troll?
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:15:47
Why it is a big question? I do not see a big difference between 0.85 / 1.00 / 1.05 ... 
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:39:54
whats the private key for the 
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:27:47
So you are basically saying, that I can convert BTG to BTC without worrying about replay ?
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:11:37
What convinced u for this opinion?
I mean, you just didn't probably suck this from your finger.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:12:17
Okay, but what you can do with 1 bt2x if it will be worth pennies?
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:56:05
I highly advise not having those stored at coinbase - you don't own private key and the fork is about to come
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:44:07
i made two addresses
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:04:09
thank you, strangers! :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:52:37
well, if you don't feel even a bit sketchy about this 'shitcoin', i am sorry for you.
the hard fork could have been done **way** better. if it would be executed by a competent and professional team. 
this kinda looks like some guys in some basement, got some marketing moves and attention and they want to get rich and dissapear.   ��
no seriously,
- the developers were shady until now (they've edited the homepage - would you bet 100btc its not a generated name with a placeholder face image?), but the main developer is still someone unknown.
- on their website they stated for 1-2 weeks  that **bitcoin gold has implemented replay protection**. While the truth was **it has not been done** ( idk, maybe they finished it this day or so )
- yesterday, you knew already in the morning, that the block will ocur today and that btgold or how is the shortcut will be a FAIL. Another issue on github (which im sure was read by them) was encouraging that it is not wrong to say we need more time. Guess if they did that.. yea ( i mean no. )
- if you had 1 bitcoin ( which seems shit ton money to me ) you get ~1.50$ in exchange right now. ��
- they have shitton of blocks premined. they were running node ( idk if thats the right name ) privately. the first 80 000k or idk how many is for their 'salaries'
- a bonus one which got on my mind: they've raised bounties on github so someone would code MAIN FEATURES for them. paid in bitcoingold ������ 
- even if you get 200 shitcoin for developing their shit, who you think will buy the shitcoin from u? 
a guy with &gt;125 iq and a common sense would not trust them.
execution of this hard fork: **-3/10**
likelihood of scamming your ass: **9,843/10**

@_date: 2017-10-31 16:12:34
What is DCA?
Also, if OP thinks it will go to the moon in few weeks, he can invest like every monday for a 1500. 
That's better in my opinion, than investing 7000 at monday and then tearing hairs because it will dip on friday or something like that
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:46:00
i really hope you find your time to secure everything and to stay safe from scammers
damn i want to time travel backwards so badly, I don't have even a satoshi :D anyways, if you someday manage to send breadcrumbs of those, I would love one ! :D ( just raising my hand up as others over here )
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:25:56
They don't have replay protection, you also sold btc.��
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:39:00
Does sending it to the second addres count as spending?:D
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:55:15
no. in my opinion, the new fork is scam.
it has not yet finished source code, sketchy incompetent dev team, no reverse protection or what its named..
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:56:05
more transaction == slower confirms, or?
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:56:18
Error 404: language not found

yes, pardon my mistake
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:20:22
Well bro, I won't measure my dick with yours.
fyi, I was not born in english speaking country and you got everything i typed.
and wtf. The main and only point was, if you send bitcoingold now, you are risking that your transaction will get replayed. do you disagree? no. there we go
and yes i do watch r&amp;m, that copy pasta meme made me giggle for the 1x  .
@_date: 2017-10-19 08:07:11
Why do you guys think it will fall?
It was 5300 yesterday, now its 5600.
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:31:32
what happens on this fork
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:36:26
DO NOT MOVE YOUR bitcoin gold!!! They haven't implemented replay protection
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:58:21
wtf isn't it unsafe to use it multiple times for sending, without changing the wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:54:45
well I've sent two bucks into that wallet. The transaction is still pending /coinbase/. After it has been done, than i guess everythings normal, right?
