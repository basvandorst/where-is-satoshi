I'll have a crack at this as both a BTC and BCH holder. There is legitimate concern for how large the blocksize can increase to before the network becomes centralised. The argument is that as the blocks become larger, then more capable hardware is needed every time to successfully run a node. You would stop being able to use Raspberry Pi's etc as nodes until only high end hardware and internet connections are capable of running a full node, meaning it could get to a point where only a few richer entities (wealthy people, corporations etc) could run a node. People over on say that the largest blocksize they would increase BCH to is 32MB (for now anyway).
An opposing argument is one you've already heard, but also that it's more resilient to attacks, as it's much harder to clog up the mempool if the blocks are larger. It has been shown that the +7MB increase has shown its benefits, and on chain scaling isn't all doom and gloom. However many people, including me, see block size increase as a temporary but necessary upgrade until off-chain scaling becomes more developed and more widely adopted. BCH wouldn't be doing as well as it's doing now if there was even a +1MB increase (see: Segwit2x).
I hope this helps, and as usual, don't take this as hard facts. This is just from my understanding.
Edit: spelling.

Ahh, the shills have arrived!

There is still a lot of discussion of Bitcoin at though. It was originally created to host discussions about Bitcoin and all related forks (and was created for another reason, I'm sure you know it).
Both and have different purposes so there's no need for an exchange of ownership, and and shouldn't exist.

The fact is you shouldn't need to use Mempool stats just so you don't pay &gt;£5 fees, but as you said, you do.

Hmm fair enough. I just get really suspicious of new accounts in the crypto community.

1 week old account. Hmm...
