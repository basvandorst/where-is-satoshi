The debt between all agents in an economy can easily be of much higher value than the actual money supply. That's pure logic. 
The same people that have no clue how the world economy works wants to "overthrow" governments and central banks makes no sense to me. What in the world makes you people think that anarchy in the money supply is a good idea if you have absolutely zero clue how the world works.

This is stupidest thing I have ever heard.

While in reality you have no idea what you're talking about. There is literally 0 basis for the number you're pulling out of your ass.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:21:58
It is.

Why would the fact that several years later, we're above pre-crisis levels mean that we're dur for a global crisis? That makes no sense at all.

500k bitcoin doesn't make any sense unless we're heading in for massive inflation.

It's a lot better than 90% of all crypto-subs full of people pulling overly precise projections out of their ass. OP is absolutely right; we dont know shit.

You are kidding me

There isn't even 22 trillion USD in circulation. If Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency, then it would make no fucking sense. 
You guys dont seem to have the slightest clue about currencies if you think 22T makes any sense at all.

If it's not a currency, then what is it? And for the love of god don't say store of value please.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:11:03
How is that more than just a currency? machine to machine transactions, nano transactions are all fine, but its not more than a currency; it's another *form* of currency that holds no more fundamental value than traditional currency does.
You just say that it's a store of value. However you bring no explanation to why its a store of value. I'm sorry, but you sound like a teenager with no actual education on economics if you think any of the stuff you say make sense. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:07:07
You are absolutely fucking delusional if you think anything near that will be reached. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:16:54
You're addressing the wrong number and make a comparison that make no sense at all. 
Secondly, yes; the global burger chain do infact have more utility.

Bitcoin and cryptos in general seem to attract the lowest common denominator. The same people that have zero clue about economics and the financial system wants to overthrow central banks and fiat currency. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:03:54
If you make more money on your debt than the interest rate of such debt, you should absolutely increase your debt to increase capital. You people have zero fucking clues about the economy. Central banks are not evil and actually serves an important purpose.

I would understand your sarcastic way of correcting him if his title said "BTC hits all time high of 6k for the first time in history". But his title never mentioned "all time high", so he didn't repeat himself. I don't really follow your reasoning.

If the EU-commision or the US government banned all use of cryptocurrencies and imposed a penalty for using it; yes they would fucking kill Bitcoin. You people act like Bitcoin is some kind of revolution while 99,9% are just trying to get rich fast.
