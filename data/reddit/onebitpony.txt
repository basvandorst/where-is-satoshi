can't you just look up your wallet addresses in 
you can either wait a long time for your wallet to sync, or if you have the priv key, import you addresses into a thin client.

Anyone upgrade to OSX Maverick and using Armory? It doesn't startup for some reason ... :(

+1 this adds another layer of security. But after hearing all these hacked stories from btc-e, I withdrew all my coins to my personal wallets. After the confirmation email, I got a pop up in Russian that scared me. I assumed I got hacked, but then I remember the site was Russian and translated the message and it was just saying it was successful. All my coins were showing up in my wallet in under a minute.

Since there's no Armory for Litecoins yet, the best and more secure way is to follow this guide here:

Hi, bitcoin noob here. I'm a bit confused. I know it's highly unlikely, but let's say someone won the universe lottery and actually generated a Bitcoin address that you had. What then? When a bitcoin wallet app generates an address, there's a public address and a private key right? Do all public bitcoin addresses only have one key to access the funds? If the stanger was able to successfully generate your public address, will they need to have also generate your exact private key to have access to your funds? Do wallet apps check to see if the newly create address is already in use or has a balance? [](/dashconfused)
