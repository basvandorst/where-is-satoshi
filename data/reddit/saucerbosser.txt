Well said, if Amazon was accepting bitcoin, it probably be far more stable as a result

Post, but downvote. Allow people to see everything but allow the quality articles to float to the top

People used to not know how to use smartphones, now everyone has them. Hell, back in the day people couldn't read or add. People learn, they adapt. Its in our nature :)

Still stolen. Maybe not by the letter of the law but by any objective measure.

Oh I forgot. That one magic word that makes murder, theft, and kidnapping justified.

Savings = investments.
This is a basic theory of econmonics. (Not that they are the same but and in an economy they remain roughly equal)

802.11N+ is my guess. That shit is magical.

Everybody said that protectionist tariffs to protect the unions and auto industry would cause the US to fall behind the rest of the world. And then look at the rust buckets and pieces of shit they made in the 80s to early 00s.  They don't care. It's not about about what's best, it's about what gives them the most power, wealth, and control.

802.11 is the IEEE (Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers) designation for a set of protocols (or rules) for developing a WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network). In other words, 802.11 is just the rules of how wireless internet works, just like in your house.
The letter designates which version of the rules you are using. 802.11a was one of the first protocols to reach the market. Wireless routers got really popular around the time that b and g came out.  Each set of rules have different performance characteristics, generally, letters later in the alphabet demonstrate higher data transfer speeds.
N is the newest commercial version of 802.11, for all intents and purposes.  [802.11N can have speeds as high as 600 Mbit/s.](
The + designation in 802.11N+ signifies that the device uses N protocol with an increased range.
802.11N+ are very fast wireless devices with a decent range.  Highly recommended for anyone with a large house or with the desire to use the internet outside of the home (in the yard or on the porch for instance).

bitcoins are finite and the dollar will eventually collapse or continue inflating. if the inflation is allowed to continue indefinitely, the limit of the ratio of bitcoin to dollar will approach infinity. if a bitcoin is worth $100 today and it is approaching a limit of infinity, at some point, the value of bitcoin will be anything and everything between 100 and infinity
Edit: that guy already deleted his comment so I'll leave my response here. a preemptive shock and awe if you will:
The only 'facts' I'm claiming are as such:




obviously the value of the bitcoin can fall, but it is finite. the dollar is infinite. I wasn't claiming that the btc WILL take over, I was just explaining why coinurl would make such a claim.
The future is a hypothetical place and no one can make any sort of prediction of how it will operate with certainty.
I think you will get downvotes for a few reasons.
A) i did use actually true facts.
B) I never claimed the bitcoin *couldn't* be worth 0 by next week (although value is subjective and I will argue that anything will have a universally agreed upon value of 0)
C) You are trying to be a dick.

See that's where you went wrong.
