Http:// will be launching a bitcoin visa debit card in December when we launch into private beta. It will be linked directly to a wallet address specifically used for your card and you can recharge it from the iOS app or online in realtime.

In December Cryptosigma is launching the first Bitcoin wallet that allows users to choose which currency they pre-dominantly keep their wallet Balance in whether it be BTC, USD, SGD, THB with more currencies to follow. When you select a favourite currency, any BTC funds you receive will automatically be converted into that currency and stored in your wallet.  When you want to send BTC or buy something using a QR code for example the correct number of BTC needed for your transaction will be bought.  This is how i feel Bitcoin can pass 'the mum test' and onboard a lot more people who would like to use bitcoin as a payment/remittance protocol but not as a store of value (not trying to spam you all but wanted to chime in on the discussion)  as a side note, we are also using a non-custodial multi sig wallet structure.

They could use  when it launches in January, the sender can send bitcoin to the recipient, the recipient can order the Cryptosigma Visa Debit Card and simply withdraw the money from a local ATM. I hope this helps.

Its a regular event held where there are talks on various topics and there was a lot of interest from the group about the possibility of having a talk on virtual currency as its actually very difficult to remit money internationally from Thailand.  You cannot do this from your online banking account.  You must go to the branch and fill out a lot of paperwork.  To cut a long story short they came across my blog  and i agreed to put a talk together for them and here we are :) Happy Days.

 hehe, it certainly can be used for remittance... a good use case example a) would be: 
The Philippines, they have the biggest inward remittance market at the world.  An overseas worker could use Cryptosigma to send Bitcoins to their mother for example, and rather than mum having to figure out how to use Bitcoin she can just withdraw local currency in cash from the ATM.
Use case example b) would be:
Thailand is an incredibly hard place to do outwards remittance, you have to visit your branch and fill in lots of paperwork.  It is not possible to simply do an international money transfer from your online banking account believe it or not.  
Using Cryptosigma anyone can send bitcoins to another bitcoin wallet anywhere in the world and they can withdraw the money in their currency of choice via the ATM using the Debit Card or directly to their locally linked bank account using our withdraw function.
