Ive held through every major crash since MTGox and Im still holding.  Price cant go up continuously things like this need to happen.  Remember how scarce bitcoin is and relax...Sit back forget about your coins, look back in 10 years and laugh.

Thanks for your feedback, I have implemented an information popover for the jobs, and will look into putting the USD price on the home page too.

Thank you, let your friends know please.  We will be doing an LTC giveaway in the next few days if we get enough likes and followers on twitter and facebook.

Testnet bitcoins aren't really worth anything, they are used mainly by developers in order to test bitcoin related developments without actually having to spend real bitcoins.

Should be working..?

I recently lost my 2fa for green address with 15btc in the account. I emailed them and they responded in about 5 minutes and subsequent replies within 2 minutes of each reply. They were very helpful and helped me resolve the issue suggesting nlocktime, they refused to reset my 2fa which is probably a good thing. In the end I managed to reset mine by disabling with SMS and re-enabling it again so make sure you set an SMS backup for 2fa. Failing that email notifications with nlocktime.zip and gentle tool will help. For anyone considering green address please don't listen to horror stories they are a great company.

Hey! I have experience developing custom escrow applications with bitcoin. If you send me a detailed specification of the type of escrow you need I can have a look into programming it into an app for you. I'm sure that multisig and nlocktime in combination would be able to solve your problem.
Feel free to PM me with some details. Id be able to supply example work and previous employer recommendations of similar projects.
Let me know of this sounds like a good option for you.  At least with this option there is no trust in third parties as you will own the escrow application used to make trades.
@_date: 2015-09-07 16:55:57
Sorry if you feel that I didn't answer your questions.  I feel that I answered them pretty well?
Our environment is totally secure, we never store private keys or user funds and each member of the escrow only ever has one key and an encryption password.  Therefore, can only release funds using either the other parties key or the encrypted third key.  
As for not knowing what we are doing:  I challenge you or any other developer to create a total escrow system without using bitcoind and using pure js library,  this was the most technical and challenging aspect of the entire system and many hours of testing and development has gone into making this totally secure.  
Feel free to try to hack / exploit our service but I foresee failure for anyone that tries.
What else do you need to know?  We are happy to explain to you our process.
@_date: 2015-09-08 07:40:17
Only one key of 3 is emailed. How do you propose we do it differently to make it more secure? You have to email the details in some form. Suggestions are welcome as the project is still in alpha phase.
Thank you for your interest.

1. We generate the multisig address using  example here:
2.  We have an inhouse app which takes the encrypted key and the decryption password and returns the key.  This is kept offline.
3.  The 1st and 2nd keys are e-mailed directly to each party, and never touched by cryptogrind again unless the party signs the escrow using their key.
@_date: 2015-09-07 16:25:08
When you sign up, you provide us with an e-mail address.
When an escrow is created, the first key is shown on screen to the creator and e-mailed to him based on his e-mail stored.  The second key is e-mailed to the freelancer who has had their proposal accepted, who also provided us with their email address.  The third key is stored in the database but it is totally encrypted.  Each escrow party also receives an encryption password which cryptogrind can use to decrypt the third key.
Basically we cannot use our third key to release funds unless instructed by the employer or freelancer using their encryption password.  We hope that most of the time the employer and freelancer can sign their escrow together 2-of-3 and release escrow funds.  The third encrypted key is there in-case of a dispute.
None of the keys are ever stored in the database, only the third encrypted key is stored here, which is usless without the de-cryption password.
I should also mention, the encryption password is not stored, only e-mailed to the freelancer and the employer along with their unique keys.
What do you think?
@_date: 2015-09-07 16:07:18
Good idea!  I will have a look into this!
@_date: 2015-09-10 13:41:17
We have now implemented PGP into the user settings area of the site.  This means, that if a PGP public key is inserted here, multisig escrows with the password and the private key is encrypted, the user can use their private PGP key to decrypt the e-mail.  If no PGP is supplied, the email still goes as plain text.  Therefore, up to the user to decide whether to encrypt their private key e-mails.  THanks for the suggestion tmornini!
@_date: 2015-09-08 12:49:05
Thats a really good idea actually, thank you!  We will implement this feature as an optional setting inside user settings, so that if they have a PGP key the e-mail will be encrypted before sending.

Litecoin wallet by paypal would be nice.

There is a drop-down at the top right of the navigation bar "Resources" all the information regarding the site can be found here.  No need to login/sign up to see this information.  
If you don't want to login with Facebook you can use local sign up, username / password, very easy.  I'm sorry but I don't really like the look of that bithours website, it looks thrown together, but thank you for your time nevertheless. 
Thanks again for your input on the site, although we're sure that you can do better right?  We look forward to seeing your site up and running soon, let us know when that happens.
Thank you for your support.
@_date: 2016-05-27 12:22:22
This means I'm rich then.
@_date: 2015-10-19 12:51:18
Haha, thanks for your interesting feedback.  
I will certainly address the points.  The facebook login is for people who want a fast login, no information about their jobs or work goes to facebook.  I will look into BitId, but this site is geared towards people who are new to Bitcoin too, and may not know how to use Bitcoin yet.
Commission on escrow is listed in out FAQ page, it appears that you didn't read this?
We take 4% on each escrow, but you can earn this back with referrals to cryptogrind.  If you refer a user to cryptogrind you get 2% on every escrow they complete for life, so if you list a service and refer the buyer, you only pay 2% on that escrow.  And if they order again and again from others, you earn.
I will never spam the site with advertisements, you can rely on that.  It makes things look unprofessional.
If you find a link to that web tool, please let me know and Ill look into it.
Thanks again,  have a good day.
