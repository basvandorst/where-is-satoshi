Very cool, never though about having a raspberry pi inside the cabinet of an desktop computer. Not a bad idea. 
But, are you not running lightning?? This is 2018, all the cool kids are using bitcoin + lightning now

Thanks for the feedback! Very helpful. Not sure why the eclair wallet didn’t work. I’ll look into it. I’m sure I’ll be able to fix it.
Glad both payment and payout worked :)

shameless self promotion. Made this site [ just been a couple of week, but already received and paid out around 500 transactions using lightning :) 
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:24:46
Sure. To process payments I used an open source system called btcpay, easy to set up
To set up lightning and bitcoin locally I used this tutorial (highly recommended): 
As a backend on top of that I use nodejs, to pay invoices and such, I based it on this project: 
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:55:32
Thanks :) 
yeah both lnd and bitcoin runs on the raspberry pi. I also have a nodejs server on the raspberry that work as an API. When you request payouts it’s all handled on the raspberry 
The btcpay server is a virtual machine that I’ve also set up. Also running lnd and bitcoin, but you could easy have both a website and BTCpay running on raspberry along with bitcoin and lnd 
@_date: 2018-09-27 09:09:17
My plan is to accumulate as much as possible before the next halving. Before that I'm fine with a slow or sideways price development.  
@_date: 2018-09-10 12:02:23
No, with lightning you can make millions of transactions between nodes in a fraction of a second. This is not recorded on the blockchain, so it can not be logged by pages like txstreet. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 10:11:55

I like your attitude 
@_date: 2018-09-12 11:32:40
Sorry about that. Sometimes lightning attempts to pay an invoice and then nothing happens, no error message and no success message. In these cases I have to assume the payment went through, at least for a while, but when I see lnd never pays the invoice I manually reset the spins. 
If you visit the site again now, is your spin back? I think you should have a 100 spins now, let me know if that is not the case. 
Thanks for testing :)

@_date: 2018-09-18 09:23:28
The insiders with most to gain/lose accumulate bitcoin and never sell, because they know it will increase in value in the long run or strongly believe it will. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 15:51:09
I think just creating one outgoing channel helps the network. If other nodes then connect to you, that already creates channels where funding exist into your node and out from your node. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 10:28:28
Lightning is still in heavy development, but yes, you can do millions of transactions without hitting the blockchain with lightning. So this can solve the scaling problem. Still a lot of things to figure out, but so far I'm very impressed. I have already done hundreds of transactions with lightning. All instant with virtually no fees.

@_date: 2018-08-29 22:22:51
If you don't have any funds and created no payment channels it could be difficult to create a route to your node, but one can still create a direct route to your node. Not going through any other funded channels. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 13:16:33
Nothing, but by adding and running a bitcoin + lightning node you contribute to the network. So you can feel good about that :) . There is fees, but they are measured in satoshi ie. 1 / 100 000 000 of a Bitcoin. So a satoshi here and there won't really add up much. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 08:54:33
Lets hope the story repeat it self. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 07:49:54
If you look to the right you can see my node
@_date: 2018-08-27 11:38:21
Yeah, but to really contribute to the network you really need a dedicated server (like a raspberry pi) running 24/7. Having a node that only run while your computer is on is not really beneficial. 
But the tutorial is not really that difficult, and you learn a lot about linux, firewalls, bitcoin, lightning etc. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 07:03:33
Yes, you could start a lightning node. I could then, as a third party, set up a payment channel with you and transfer bitcoins to your LN address. Of course this will be settled on the blockchain when the channel closes. 
In the future this will probably be more common. The fact that it's instant and have practically no fees makes it just a much better user experience. Right now I don't think any exchanges support this, but as lightning becomes more and more common users will demand it and it will be common place. I image nobody will do much on-chain transactions in the future unless it's really significant sums of money they need to transfer all at once.  
@_date: 2018-08-27 20:36:07
Do it :) There is 913 000 people in this subreddit, but I don't see 913 000 lightning nodes... Someone is slacking 
@_date: 2018-08-02 09:08:39
Really cool! Could you post a link to their node in case other people want to fund a channel with them, or maybe your node so one could channel payments through you
@_date: 2018-08-27 13:38:53
There is a difference here between contribute and use, just like you can use Bitcoin without a full node, you will be able to use lightning without a full node / dedicated server. 
I believe the watchtowers are for lightning nodes as an extra layer of security. So I guess not. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 11:20:30

You don't need to use that one channel with 1 bitcoin. If you have a node running for a while you end up with a lot of channels connected to you. 
The roulette site probably have many outgoing channels that it can send from and somewhere along the way there is a node connected with you with enough funding. 
Of course sending as much as 3 bitcoin at once is not so easy with lightning right now, it's not that many people that have channels with that kind of capacity.

Scalability is in theory infinite with lightning. Can't say what happens with other alt-coins.
Bitcoin does have the advantage that a lot more people actually use it and set up servers, raspberry pi's etc to support the network. Lightning works better the more nodes are on the network, so a "small" alt coin will have less nodes to route transactions and less liquidity.

To be honest I'm fine with loosing these people, they don't care about the technology. They don't invest any time in learning how it works. They only want a quick buck. Some of these people are real toxic too, they want Bitcoin to fail and can't believe their "insert alt-coin" don't replace bitcoin already.

As the the supply decrease, bitcoin becomes more scarce and harder to buy. This should naturally drive up the price.
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:37:24
Several things are missing before lightning can take off. 
1) Channel factories, [
With channel factories 10 users can create 100 channels between each other in one on-chain transaction. This will enable scaling. Right now each user create a channel using an on-chain transaction, and do another on-chain transaction to close it at some point the future. This is not enough for real scaling. 
2) Atomic Multipath Payments,  [
Right now, to send 10$, you need to find a single path with 10$+ incoming funds on every node along the path. And each of those nodes need to be online. This means you some times can't find a path. A solution to this is to split up the transaction in several smaller transactions and then combine them again at the destination. This will greatly increase the chances of finding a path. 
3) Exchanges implementing lightning
When you instantly receive bitcoin from an exchange to your lightning wallet and can instantly spend it, it will greatly improve the user experience. It can allow users to "only" use lightning and only experience instant bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:20:31
I recommend you start downloading the bitcoin blockchain on your computer now. It can take a few days. You can read about that here:

I did sell a bit when it hit 18.000, but I was too greedy. I didn't have the balls to sell everything and held most. Still hodling. The reason I sold at that point was that everyone was buying, and to be honest, a lot of dumb people that had no idea what bitcoin was, was buying. That is the point where you should sell. When your friend, that don't know how to send an attachment via email, invest in bitcoin (or some shitcoin), then you sell, you sell everything.

It was a joke to all my friends, until 2017, when they all suddenly remembered this bitcoin thing I had been talking about for years. Realizing I just made a fortune and that if they had listened to me, they would have made a lot of money them self, they got mostly annoyed.
Trying to replicate my success / luck, they invested in all kinds of shit coins at the worst possible time, falling for every single bitconnect and similar scam. Of course they lost 98% of their investments and now they are back at thinking the whole bitcoin / blockchain thing was a scam / bubble again. 
I bet the exact same thing will happen again. Bitcoin will shoot up again at some point, the mainstream will join in right at the peak, lose everything soon after. While the smart money invest heavy now, and sell right before the new correction. Rinse and repeat.

@_date: 2019-02-06 13:20:09
They are working on channel factories were you can open multiple lightning channels at ones, and they are working on ways to "top off" your channels without closing them, as well as sending through several channels at ones. You are not going to need much transactions on the blockchain at all. 
Basically you will just need do one transaction on the blockchain and from that point you can do an infinite amount of transactions instantly, as long as you want. 
I have several nodes where I have not closed a single channel for more than three months, and I have done thousands of transactions during that time. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:09:14

I think people here misunderstand how lightning works, you just update the state of a channel when you send or receive funds, not sure how you possibly could lose funds. You don't need to be online 24/7. Doing a lightning transaction and then shutting down your lightning node causes no problems at all.  If the power goes out, nothing happens..
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:57:26
You don't have do deal with any of those things either. This really gives the wrong impression of lightning. I have been running a lightning node for over a year and handled thousands of transactions. I have not dealt with any of these things.
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:22:03

@_date: 2019-12-01 15:59:25
I have been running two lightning nodes for over a year, and have pulled the power cord a times, restarted it or had the power go out for hours, upgraded bitcoin and lnd (stopping both services) maybe ten times. And there has been no problem at all. In my experience lightning is quite stable and well designed to handle these cases. You won't suddenly lose all your funds...
@_date: 2019-12-26 13:30:59
There is no way to know how many lightning transactions are being done. Could be millions of transactions per minute for all you know.
@_date: 2018-11-03 14:41:25
Yeah, that is right. I guess it is because it is based on the bitpay API where you always set a price in a given fiat currency. 
Why it can't support just setting an amount of satoshi / BTC as a price I have no idea. That would be a lot easier.

I'm no expert, but to put it simply it's a "problem" right now that you that you have to be online on a semi regular basis to check your lightning channels and their state. If your lightning node goes offline for a long time, someone might publish an old channel state (where they had more money then they have now). When this happen you can "punish" the attacker and steal all their funds, but it requires you to be online. 
A solution to this is to not just watch your own channels, but act as a watchtower and watch over other nodes channels as well. If you detect anyone on the network publishing old states, you can "help them out". Having these watchtowers would make it a lot easier for mobile devices as you can safely have a lightning node offline.

To a certain extent, the higher the amount the less nodes have funding to route the transaction. 
But if they used something like coingate to process payments and you had a payment channel over 39 AUD with their node, your fee would be 0 sat. Often you need to route through one or two other nodes, but most often the fee is 1-2 sat per node. So the total would then be 0-5 sat. 
This is the most common scenario. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:39:53
It terms of computer science the network topology is more decentralized with more nodes and better for bitcoin as a network protocol for transferring value. 
In more philosophical terms, centralization can mean something else of course, but I won't say this has anything to do with "concentration of power". They are not planning to invade Poland with lightning nodes.

It is impossible to tell exactly, but if you run a couple of nodes for a while you can see the number of updates to your channels. This gives a an indication of how many transactions has been routed through your node. 
Here is an example from my node for example:
^($ lncli listchannels | grep num)
^("num\_updates": "91",)  
^("num\_updates": "228",)  
^("num\_updates": "718",)  
^("num\_updates": "794",)  
^("num\_updates": "88",)  
^("num\_updates": "775",)  
^("num\_updates": "235",)  
^("num\_updates": "40",)  
^("num\_updates": "7",)  
^("num\_updates": "199",)  
^("num\_updates": "371",)  
^("num\_updates": "356",)  
^("num\_updates": "7",)  
^("num\_updates": "773",)  
^("num\_updates": "162",)  
^("num\_updates": "547",)  
^("num\_updates": "412",)  
^("num\_updates": "296",)  
^("num\_updates": "4432",)  
^("num\_updates": "4218",)  
^("num\_updates": "2240",)  
^("num\_updates": "3226",)  
^("num\_updates": "308",)  
^("num\_updates": "316",)  
^("num\_updates": "0",)  
^("num\_updates": "185",)
As you can see, my single node has routed thousands of transactions the last few months. All off-chain.

You can run a pruned bitcoin node, you don't need the full blockchain. It is up to you how much disk space you are willing to use. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 11:27:40
Great minds think alike ;)
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:50:45
You are right, the priority now is to develop the lightning protocol, not to make it user friendly. 
Don't worry, it will be made tons of lightning wallets in the future that are user friendly, that will be the easy part
@_date: 2019-01-09 13:24:52
A bitcoin full node only takes 1 MB per 10 minutes to keep the blockchain updated. There will be some more traffic, but not much. Lightning is much more active, but does not take much bandwidth, it is just do a lot of small requests. You won't notice it really.

The code is here: 
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:15:30
That example is from my rasberry pi running Bitcoin core + LND. It is only 24/7 yes. I have another node hosted on a cloud service that is also running BTCPay. That have 10 times as much activity. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 11:56:10
This is awesome, I assumed big actors would put up one big node with a large number of channels, but instead they can do like this and set up 42 nodes and spread BTC between them. That is much better for the decentralization of the network.   
@_date: 2019-01-09 13:30:18
You will make a satoshi or 2 for every transaction that is routed through your node. That does not equal much fiat currently though. 
It is like mining bitcoin in 2009, you got a lot of BTC back then, but it was not worth much. Now you get satoshi, but it is not worth much. Yet.. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 08:29:45
I have already paid out a some of BTC. All these transactions are public so anyone can verify that it's legit.

4. total balance actually shows the amount of satoshi, 1 satoshi being 0.00000001 BTC.

Right now you can just open one lightning channel per blockchain transaction yes, but in the future opening multiple channels per bitcoin transaction will be possible. Obviously without adding much more data to the block then we do now. 
Even without doing that you can still open a single payment channel and do a million transaction through this channel. So it is still infinitely scalable. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:56:14
well done! But have you set up lightning ?
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:48:13
By the use of channel factories you can create an infinite amount of lightning channels with only two transactions on the blockchain. You can read all about it here: 
I do not spout a bunch of shit. It is a part of the lightning development that I follow closely. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:42:22
The assumption that lightning transactions will fill up the mempool and drive up fees is wrong. You could in theory create 10 or a million lightning channels with one bitcoin transaction in the mempool and have those open forever. It is infinitely scalable.

Seems to me that more small businesses are now finally starting to accept bitcoin as they can have instant transactions with lightning + bitcoin.
Before a transaction took  at least 10 minutes, so it could not be used to buy a cup of coffee. Now crypto payments are finally instant and free (given you have a direct payment channel with lnd).
