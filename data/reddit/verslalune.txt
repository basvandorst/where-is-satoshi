How's LN these days anyway? Last I heard it had a few million USD equivalent in the network. I'm genuinely curious.

Exactly. A competent ML poker bot would exploit weaknesses in large data sets.

If you're buying BTC today with the expectation that it's a faster and better form of payment than the current status quo, then you're entirely missing the point. When the car was first invented, it was a superior form of transport to the horse and carriage, but it was useless because it lacked public infrastructure like paved roads and gas stations. It's the same story for every new technology. If BTC is worse than the status quo in 15-20 years from now, then you might have a point.

Lol, no-coiners now pity crypto holders. At least it's a nice change to the vitriol last year. So we've got that going for us.

Yeah I agree it has to happen, but through a conservative approach, with focus on infrastructure technology rather than pure developments in the protocol.
edit: for example, Bitcoin implementing privacy tech like minblewimble would probably be beneficial, but there's no rush. It's better to watch these protocols in the wild for a few years before implementation.

Yes, I take this stance too.
@_date: 2019-09-21 14:37:02
Yeah I know, I was active in the forum back then. Today you rarely have an altcoin that isn't an ICO.
@_date: 2019-09-21 14:00:30
The date really gives it away. Bitcointalk was the go to place till like 2015-2016. Back in 13' the forum was filled with what we now call ICO's. It's still pretty active though.

You consider Ethereum to be a "shitcoin"?
@_date: 2019-09-21 17:16:03
I know Ethereum's initial coin distribution as I was around back then. And no, I don't think the "premine" makes it a shitcoin at all; I was in favor of it then, and I'm in favor of it today. 
edit: I'm also in favor of perpetual ultra low emission (i.e. no supply cap)

I'm not American so I don't give a shit. It's surprising because usually your Republican party comes up with the bad ideas.

Governments are typically composed of more than a single person. You're signaling the 'left' in your parent comment, so point to me to legislative action by a 'left' government that led to restrictions of freedom with no constitutional accountability.

Give me one modern example

I remember lurking the polo troll box.
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:54:44
democrat, surprisingly
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:05:07
Well now I'm confused. You're going to have to define the term 'left' because that's a pretty generalized statement.
