. ... no comments. Well, just a few:
. I really like the [Bread Wallet App]( Thanks! But this is the second time in a roll. 
. In this case I was aware of the situation, I knew how to solve it, but I couldn't... so, the only choice was "to believe" that it would be different this time... 
. ... and now, (as the transactions in both cases were made to withdraw cash from ATMs with  &amp;  I have no Euros (€) in my pocket (again) and (as the world still needs to evolve a lot to fully embrace crypto, I need this old thing, cash) I'm thinking about to use another wallet to make an EMERGENCY transaction... and I don't want to do it, because I really love the BreadWallet, the ideology, the project, The Thing.
. ... and I agree, the merchant should/could care about checking the client accountability instead , sometimes it's easy: in this specific transaction, I'm dealing with a company that had already received lots of payments from me, know my identity   we are exchanging  e-mails about the two cases (and others, in a long dialogue about bugs, Wiki, features, ideas, Bitcoins...)... they could just release the euros and wait for the bits... 
. ... $&amp;¥
. Anyway...   for your amazing work... keep it real!

*(I realize that you can't control the fees market variation and that's why I can't understand the authoritarian control over the amount per transaction)
*(just give us and option to enable control over the fees, so we can manage the situation acordilly to the matter; you can always hide it within an "TT" link at the lower right corner to avoid confusion with "the normalized")
*(no need to fear the Experiment; maybe you will remember this Aaron)

. ... and now, with Apple Lightning, Apple iDevices solved your speed problem? 
. (I think) This is a practical example of why the old analogue port was already dead, asking to be removed...

. ... if you include "Buy &amp; Sell" (good) transactions in the mathematics, the fees should/could be negative!
