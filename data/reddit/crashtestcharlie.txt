That’s with the assumption the taxes are only collected on exiting an exchange as fiat.
That is wrong.
Post IRS v. Coinbase, you’re going to get a tax statement just like a stock broker sends. Every trade and buy/sell will have a dollar cost on it. And you could owe even if the coins never got cashed out.
This will encourage hodling and purchases sent directly to an offline wallet. Which will then result in IRS nastygrams wanting to know what you did with that transfer out because your exchange gave you up.

I'd say try Nicehash, since then you're selling your hashing power to ppl that want to cloud mine. You get paid regardless of blocks found. Plus you could set up with gpus to start and see how it goes. Then sell the gpus if it sucks. Or use the money to then upgrade your rigs if it works out. 
You could have a mix of gpu and asic miners as you're just selling time on them, not actually mining.

The lack of an iOS app is probably hurting them more than bitcoin fees.

Move 80% to a HW wallet, move the other 20% to Binance. They didn't go offline today. Then you can get your trading fix w/o risking your whole stash.
No USD/fiat out on Binance, so keep your old Gemini acct open. Then you can transfer back to get cash. Plus no verification for transfers of less than 2 btc per day. Close the CB acct.

You could get some opendime.com bit sticks in place of the paper wallet. Just to have a real gift. As for fees, good luck.

The biggest con in the world was convincing people they should buy residential property with no income potential (even to the extent of banning/regulating home-based businesses to oblivion). Now imagine if you had bought rental property, moved to a cheaper area and rolled the profits into BTC.

Search for info on the exit node hijacks. It's still useful to the agencies, for now.

They can be handed off multiple times before being opened. That's the value, not as a hardware paper wallet (where the wallet maker may keep the keys).

NN was a nice name pasted on the concept so that the established content providers could freeload on the infrastructure providers. Netflix is cheap because they don't pay extra for causing like 50% of the internet traffic. NN was passed to keep it that way, and to lock out competition.
If Google, Twitter and Facebook are all for something, it's not good for the average internet user. Don't fall for the feel-good hype.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:01:19
Why not just funnel the rental income into BTC? No need to risk the property.

You could always bail out for few years and learn a trade, earning as you learn. Then the cash and coin you accumulate along the way can pay for uni later.
There’s no rule that you have to go secondary &gt; uni directly.
You understand the debt trap, why play their game?

The number of confirmations a block has is the number of times the math has been double checked. A bad block wouldn't get confirmed.

Ideally you’d have more than one keepass file. One for web stuff, and one for more sensitive stuff that’s not accessed as much. It’s not a bad plan, and syncing to Dropbox/own cloud solves the bit rot. And frees you from a device.
Ledger + hot wallet is the way to go for a transactional setup.
