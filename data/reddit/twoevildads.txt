Well, you are halfway there.  
Disasters from government are not the exception.  They are the rule and inevitable.  The history is very nearly perfect.  
The large sociological disasters of humanity sprung from government.
So your first comment "Just because SOME governments are corrupt...." 
Government is a lie and a corruption of a human's freedom.   People getting their money out of the ultimate corruption (fiat money), is a blessing and will make things a little better for a few in the midst of the disaster, an incomplete disaster defying the complete disaster that you seem to prefer.  
The fiat money disaster is stalking the entire world population right now.  Several smaller victims are failing RIGHT NOW.  The USDollar is not a shelter as it appears.  It is only a bigger slaughter house.  The homeless littering the cities of California should tell you that the slaughterhouse is short on feed and water.  I think you know this.

Scarcity is necessary, but you are correct, it is not sufficient.  
To have value, something needs to have utility AND be scarce.  Bitcoin meets these requirements.
Well, the deflation concern is a macro-economic concern.  Bitcoin is far from having a macro economic impact.  It is a globally used money.  It has an aggregate value of $125B.  Compare that to the unknowable amount of fiat money, that estimates have at about $250T.  Bitcoin is NOT affecting any economy by disincentivising spending (at least not yet).  
Whatever niche Bitcoin fills is to be seen, somewhere between a tiny speculative asset today and extinguishing government fiat as a day to day money.  Somewhere in between, let's say.  When Bitcoin has no more potential to take over new markets, it will be value only for its exchange utility.  Then it will have no more demand pressure than solely for the growth within its natural markets.  Let's say that that is a conservatively high 10%.  Bitcoin also has supply inflation that will be in place for years yet, but let's ignore that.  So in order to meet the growth in demand due to exchange utility, the price of Bitcoin will grow at this same 10%.  
Who defers life expenditures for 10% annual gain?  And more like 5%?  Come on.  It might remain a decent investment, but the macro economy won't stall.   You have no idea if a slightly disinflationary money is macroeconomically harmful.  If 2% inflation is not harmful, 2% dis-inflation would also be not harmful.  
On the other hand the disasters of inflationary money might cause a little pause in you.  
The Fed is the same families that financed the disasters of the Communist Revolutions in Russia and China, that financed the Nazis, and that killed the nation of Japan (please refer to the documentary movie The Princes of the Yen if you want another perspective on Japan's death by the Western Central Bank cartel.) 
The Bitcoin exchanges do NOT run the currency as you suggest.  Software running on nodes runs the currency.  And yes, it is new and strange and unproven so should be considered risky.
You trust the FED!!!  Say no more. 
What it comes down to is that you are free to gobble government propaganda as you feel. You are not free to interfere with anyone else using crypto.  So why are you wasting your time?

Yes, Blockchain is more than Bitcoin.  All Blockchains are of voluntary participation, so the markets will decide which will prevail.  Bitcoin seems to be holding that pole position just fine.  Monero is the only other interesting money-only project.  Bitcoin may be the AOL of Blockchain but it doesn;t appear like that yet.
Continue to fail??  What are you talking about?  Bitcoin is up in price 12X in 2 years.  Price spikes are normal and shouldn't be used as a normalized.  There is no normal in Bitcoin's price.  
I think its pretty clear that something has to have value before it is useful as a medium of exchange or are you forgetting the Regression Theory of Money so soon?  An appreciating asset, outside "The System" (ie HODLing) is a great use case Only government enforcement is able to maintain some value in inflationary currencies. You have things upside down.
Low known inflation, a hard maximum limit, assist in the bootstrapping via being a valuable asset.

Credit cycles are the cause of booms and recessions.  These are premeditated, planned and controlled by and to the benefit of the Fiat Masters.  
Once Fiat currency is dispensed with completely, or at least, the monopoly over the definition of money is broken, then these events will be limited to whatever corral the Fiat Masters are able to hold their disciples within.  Eventually the benefits of freedom will become obvious and no one will allow him or herself to be corralled.  
This is a one way train and it's not stopping.
Edit: 
The supply of fiat has been increased greatly over the past many years.  This is a credit expansion completely under the control of central and chartered banks. AKA artificially low priced money, AKA, low interest rates.  
To check the "inflation" that they themselves created in the 1920s and the 1970s, central banks in the 1930s and in the 1980s, radically reduced credit supply, AKA, high priced money, AKA, high interest rates.  Planned, premeditated, harmful credit expansion booms and credit contraction busts.  
We are entering a new phase of this.  The asset inflation (if not so much the consumer goods inflation, TY China!), of the past, almost 30 years is due to artificially cheap money. 
The next recession/depression will be "caused' by deflation, the contraction of credit by those that hold a near monopoly on the supply of credit.  Prices of everything will drop in fiat terms.  There will be downward pressure on a speculative asset like cryptos.  However there is an ongoing upward pressure due to increased adoption across the spectrum of use cases of cryptos.  So a 25% correction in stocks and real estate is huge, but Bitcoin is more than doubling every year.  Bitcoin will probably outperform fiat value and certainly all other asset types. 
The weaker "fiats" are getting crushed by even small increase in interest rates of the USD and its satellite fiats. 
We are at the very early stage of throwing off the shackles of this millenia old game of fiat.  It probably will take a few more of these expansion/contraction events before a critical mass of people really clue in to the game.

I suppose. I have much less problem even if the worst person in the world solves a block than an infinite potential supply under the auspice of the people that already own the world from having  this same position.  
The economics of Bitcoin mining are actually kind of dismal. The supply is defined.  There is no barrier to entry.  It is designed to be marginal.  The miners have zero power in determining what Bitcoin's codebase is (as was demonstrated by last year's fork nonsense). 
It sounds like you don't really know too much about Bitcoin to be frank.

@_date: 2018-09-04 02:53:51
The problem is not that fiat money is created when credit is provided.  
The problem is that when the price (ie interest rate) is not set by supply and demand but by government enforced capacity for central banks to over and under supply and thus create price distortions is highly profitable to those who know which way that wind blows next, and destructive to nearly anyone else.

So that is the Regression Theory of Money, that something must have some utility value in itself before it can become useful as money.   This is a social sciences theory and can not be used as some  hard universal principle, so it would be unwise to get religious about it.
It's a theory and there is supporting evidence from History, so you have yet to be proven wrong.  
The difference may be that Bitcoin is the first successful attempt at designing money.  It is not like gold which has good (but not great) monetary properties and is provided by Nature.  Bitcoin is designed to be money.  
My own subjective opinion is that Bitcoin is not yet money as it has not achieved sufficient market acceptance.  But its monetary qualities are far superior to any prior monies.  
In the meantime, it is extremely useful as a value store and value transfer in the unique situations that suit it. It is an exceptional value store in time frames greater than a few years. It is an exceptional value transfer mechanism in time frames of days or even hours. 
Of course, nothing has any value except in how humans value it.

@_date: 2018-09-04 02:59:44
That's a worthwhile place to start...
Yes, Government backed fiat currency can take on the role of money, but only if there is demand.  The mechanisms to create this demand are primitive and brutal (legal tender, income tax, government indenture, future tax payer indenture).  The problem of fiat having infinite supply with a market forced to submit to government scarcity protection is not just a financial or economics problem but really moreso a moral problem.
Bitcoin has zero compulsion mechanisms, zero. Use it or don't, fork it if you don't like it.  It provides moral neutrality, which is an enourmous leap forward for human civilization.  I think human civilization can only be as good as its money.
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:25:50
Well my point is that miners have no power in the Bitcoin ecosystem and they do not even get very highly enriched, so it doesn't matter if they are pure evil scourge. The only miners who are profitable are those that actually do not measure profitability in a real manner, ie they get state subsidized electrical energy.
Also on the payment side, Bitcoin itself is morally neutral.  Well, I have long lost my blind naivete that governments, central banks and banks are not quite evil on balance.  They apply their money police capacities for their own political ends, not on moral principles.  The Western banking cabal is evil.
In comparison to fiat money, Bitcoin use, including mining, is very morally neutral.  This is probably exactly the most moral state that money can and should have, neutral.  Fiat money will compete in its historical legacy as one of humanity's most evil concoctions, despite the puppet show on the monied media.

Bitcoin as an investment is a high unknown.  It has huge unrealized potential in its utility.  It could end up worth 10's of trillions, as a significant fraction of world money supply.  Or not.  
24 month returns on Bitcoin is about 1000%.  It is stabilizing now and will grind away at 6000 USD +/- if past trends hold and then 12 to 18 months from now it will slowly rise.

It was a bubble.  It ended.  It did nothing to change the trajectory of Bitcoin.  Like the $30 bubble and the $256 bubble, and the $1200 bubble.  The dynamics and sentiments are identical.
ETFs and other investment funds are inevitable and extremely positive.  
Sure, it will bring bankers in and they will play their manipulations.  
But Bitcoin (and other chains) as a native asset will only increase in demand.  Lightning channels will lock up lots of coins in a few years.  Applications that can not be performed with fiat will demand cryptos.  These funds and futures will demand native coins.    ICOs with paper, court enforceable shareholder agreements alongside crypto ownership will be the normal way to bring share equity to the market.  Futures will ameliorate volatility.  Loans will be done with greater certainty and crypto will become money.
The Masters of Fiat are in a multifront war that they can not win.  The value of their tokens is deceit enforced at gunpoint.  They compete against other fiats and gold and everything they do costs a lot of money (their deceit and wars of enforcement), so inflation is inevitzble.  Fiat is not programmable and end users have no say in which fork to voluntarily cherish. Fiats are failing all over and the credibility of the war-police-bank-state is ebbing fast.
Fiat games are on the way out like the Pony Express.  Cryptos are here to stay. Once the Wright brothers flew, no one could say it was impossible to fly after that.  Yes, banker games may delay the inevitable, but not by much. And it will cost the bankers even more printing, hastening the ultimate end.
If you think that bankers are subsidizing a low price, you should be backing the truck up.

Look, you clearly only see Bitcoin as an investment.  That is completely legitimate, but Bitcoin is designed to be a value transfer protocol.  In that regard, Bitcoin is doing very very well and better than ever.  
Then as an investment, you do not understand it at all.   You invested in something that has historical crazy volatility including several drops greater than 75%.  But you either did not know that or you chose to take that risk.  You cry almost every day about your choice and blame a protocol.  You had no plan as to how long you would hold, you still have no plan. 
People should have zero interest in your sob story.  You invested foolishly and lost.  And in fact given Bitcoin's history of recovering from these crashes, a year or two from now you could be up several times.  
There are millions of people involved in Bitcoin. Yours is one story.  You made your choice and are currently in the red due to your own decision making.  Boohoo.

Meh.  
Firstly, your comment is towards Bitcoin Macro economics and not towards anything in the video, so its off topic.  
Second, inflation and deflation of a currency as impacting upon the macro economy are only relevant when the currency in question has some dominance in its sphere of influence.  Ie, when the Zimbabwean dollar was hyper-inflated, it really did not affect the global economy.   Likewise with Bitcoin's rather anti-inflationary property.  This has zero affect on the global economy.  So your doom and gloom "it's a scam" is not meaningful.  
Bitcoin's whole purpose is to lack of central human control.   This is a tremendous accomplishment and a boon for humanity. The purpose of money is to communicate value.  That's its only purpose.   Bitcoin is better at that than any prior money.  
The intended and so far best purpose of a blockchain is an accounting for money.  
The fact that Bitcoin has a hierarchical distribution is perhaps not a good thing but it is a fact of any economic system.  The improvement with Bitcoin is that large holders have no inert impact on things unless they spend.  Their Bitcoin holdings do nothing until they part with them.  This is a vast improvement over the infinite ledgers under the control of Central Banks.  
Central bankers as moral beacons... now that's rich.
@_date: 2018-10-11 20:50:02
What can governments do about it?  Even the most restrictive regimes, that try to control communication and thought fail in doing so.

I watched it.  It's mercifully brief.  
A few commments...
Yes, Van Falkenburgh was more intelligent measured and reasonable.
I got the feeling that this was kind of a backwater of a hearing.  That to me is a good thing. The price decrease in 2018 probably leaves them thinking that the market will just get rid of Bitcoin and they won't have to do much.  Good! They can go back to sleep until their banker bosses light hellfire under them when the price crosses 50K.  I guess it could go either way but my bet is on the latter. 
The most beautiful thing is that they can make no ruling or judgement.  There is no law that can touch the Bitcoin protocol. There is nothing that anyone in that room can do other than code up a fork and offer that to the world.  Participation is voluntary and therefore to compete against Bitcoin, you must best it, including its "network effect."  Competing protocols must be even more empowering to the user than Bitcoin is (maybe Monero, which can't seem to muster much network effect) So it amounts to nothing more than PR.  Roubini can not convince any one in government to quash Bitcoin.  All he can do is to bad mouth it for public consumption.  The more he says things like that it will never work because X, or Y reason, the more he just says that Bitcoin is not a threat.  Free people will decide the fate of Bitcoin.  Not Government nor their financiers at Central Banks.

@_date: 2018-10-13 20:04:22
You are.  A 51% attack is an expensive attack and not particularly harmful.  
Let's say it is a 75% attack.  This means that the attacker has to spend a lot of money to get themselves in this position.  They can't steal, only damage, the only people with these resources and motivation are state actors.  And what can they do?
1) Double Spends.  They can spend their own Bitcoins twice by erasing a prior block.  This is a silly attack with minor impact.  Valid transactions are the only ones in the blockchain, they just ripped a third party off who can protect themselves by waiting for a larger number of blocks which eventually become statistically irreversible even with a large attacking hashrate.
2) Empty blocks.  They can mine empty blocks.  A DOS type attack.  This is a pain but not a death knell.  There were defenses against this that are cheap and were considered in last year's scaling debate when the fine folks of Bitcoin Cash were saying they could annihilate the original Bitcoin Chain with this sort of attack.  
3) The censored transactions that you mentioned will just get mined by the non controlled miners.  The fees would go higher for the censored transactions so mining power would be incented in to the non controlled hash power.  
Think of it this way, Bitcoin pays about $75,000 every ten minutes.  Mining is marginal game.  The people that mine have enourmous capital investments already.  For a malicious player to control the market to the extent necessary to get a supermajority of hashrate, it is another order of magnitude more than miners have invested today.  And they would have to keep pumping resources into it.   A simple hardfork to a different mining algorithm to the chain followed by the real Bitcoin community, would lay waste to those enourmous investments.
So they need to outmine us and chase us down in our little closet miners all over the world at once.  It just isn't worth their effort.  Especially in some countries that have foundational laws that all other laws must comply to.  Ie think US, 1st, 2nd and 4th ammendments.  I am allowed to send messsages.  I am allowed to do that in private.  If a government agent contravenes that, I am allowed organize a militia and fight back.

Well, yes and no I think.  
At some level banks are just financial services.  And at that level, they would deal in whatever money, gold, fiat, crypto and their derivatives.  
But at another level, banks and fiat money are one and the same creature.   
Banks have a special relationship with central banks.  A central bank's ostensible purpose is to not allow regular banks to experience catastrophic liquidity shortage.  This is accomplished by allowing central banks to create fiat money from nothing other than a ledger in their books.  The asset created can be provided to a regular bank as needed in exchange for some asset from the bank's ledgers.  
This purely credit/debit is not possible in Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a simple asset, with no liability to match.
Additionally, regular banks create money when people take out credit.  They create a double entry in their ledgers, one side is "dollars", the other is the loan to their customer, which is a new asset.  This is also not possible with Bitcoin.  
So fiat banks can do things with fiat that they can't with Bitcoin.  They get great benefits from these accounting techniques.  
Because of the nature of credit money, it is prone to some problems.  The biggest is the moral problem that some people get great wealth and power because they benefit from Central bank balance sheet expansion.  For example, when a government wishes to spend money, they use bank money.  They issue bonds that they sell to the banks denominated in bank money.  These bonds are promises to pay the banks back in bank money.  This then means that the government must acquire bank money in the form of taxes.   While interest rates are essentially zero, a $22T debt seems OK.  If interest rates were even say 7%, watch out! Federal taxes would be about $4300 per year per person, just to pay the interest (if my math is correct).  Just the interest!!! Just for the federal level.   America is way past bankrupt.  It must end its relationship with The Bank through default or become slaves to The Bank.  So government enforcers work for The Bank.  Don't forget that. 
It is a bargain for borrowers to acquire bank money when the supply is expanding, (and therefore the price, interest rates, is low).  And borrowers will go quite far in debt, especially governments as for politician's, it is all other people's money.  
However the reverse is true as well.  When the supply of bank money is made to shrink by fiat banks, then interest rates rise. The value of debts against real world economy also rises.  
So while credit is expanding, borrowing is incented, money is spent into the economy and booms happen.  While credit is removed from the economy, the loans become at times unpayable and busts happen.
This is the credit cycle.  It is manufactured and premeditated wealth skimming by those that control the credit supply.  This is evidenced by History.  
The last time there was a credit shrink was in the early 1980s. It created a severe global depression.  Credit has been expanding since about 1990.  
We are at the early stages of a credit shrinkage now.  Because of the massive amount of debt relative to the economy that we have now, the rise in interest rates that is required to create a bust is not 20% like it was in the 1980s.  
Banks have a great benefit in this cycle. They earn interest regardless.  They create assets on people's acquiring loans in low interest periods.  The loans become higher value when interest rates rise.  
Central Banks wield power over governments.  Governments get to borrow at the rate decided by the Central Bank.  This then puts central banks in charge and governments are essentially their enforcers and showy puppets.  
So banks are fiat money.  
Bitcoin solves many problems, the most important is the moral problem of freedom.
Someday there may be Bitcoin banks.  But today's fiat banks lose their benefits if the fiat system disappears.  
If you realize that it takes a great deal of law and myth and propaganda to force people to use imaginary tokens that can be produced at zero cost, a lot of things come into focus.

Not to get too all metaphysical, but humans are some kind of reproductive dissipative thermodynamic structure.  We are the only thing we know of that is trying to figure out Good and Evil.  We are the only creature that has knowledge of good and evil (Satan's trick and God's curse in the Garden of Eden Parable.  Note that the authors of the parable consider this to be a curse. !!!) 
Our notions of good and evil and supporting law, etc, are perhaps more than just notional.  They definitely have helped with the success of the species, so these notions have become part of the fabric of life, an essential part of the successful propagation of us. It is a game in play, so it is hard to say the outcome, but perhaps these agreements, these notions, become as essential to life as connective tissue or neurons.   So Good and Evil become laws of Nature.  
As Bitcoiners, we can see that an important notion as money, can be achieved by a network of voluntary actors that just ascribe to some simple rules and do so without a hierarchy of people.  
I wonder if we can create a system of agreeableness that is also without hierarchy, that we can be a moral node in a sea of other moral nodes where we associate only with those we wish to.  They would have a history (as kept in an immutable external record) of living up to their own commitments to a good moral code.  Mine would include offering second chances to those that may have fallen short a few times.

I would never tell anyone they should go chin deep into crypto money. I don't think you should be suspicious, but sure be skeptical.
I am much more skeptical of the banking system than I am of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin has no barrier to entry and is open source, those are huge differences.
But it is extremely useful and will absolutely improve individual lives and thus the world.   Regularly there are stories about how thousands of people are evading Venezuela capital controls, or how nations are trying to evade the banker controlled SWIFT system.  These are ideas whose time has come.
As far as savings and investing go, of course, don't get so deep in crypto that you can't tolerate the risk.  Gold is a great option that also can not be messed with by auhority.  
The open transaction ledger of Bitcoin is both a good and bad thing.  Monero is inherently obfuscated.

That guy might want to review the cypherpunk history of Bitcoin.  For a long time people were trying to solve the basic double spend problem. Much of their work went into Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin was actually a combination of several techniques that had already been developed.  The final outcome is brilliant but it did not fall out of some lab or heaven.   
Check out Bitgold by Nick Szabo.  It predated Bitcoin by a few years, but it is close in design.  Also Hashcash by Adam Back.
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:26:05
Yes.  Bitcoin is its blockchain.  The code is open source, so it is the unique transaction record that is everything.  
So, although the algorithm is automated such that the longest accumulated proofing work is the valid chain, if someone tried to plant a year long bogus chain and erase the old one, a simple one time hardfork rule change, something like only recognizing a specific hash/nonce value from the defending chain somewhere at block height within the attacking chain, would cheaply defeat that attack.  
@_date: 2018-10-18 17:18:36
I don't think it would be that costly.  
It would be obvious if the attacker suddenly plunked down a new chain.  This would constitute an immediate emergency and consensus would form very quickly.  
Even without a hardfork to the Bitcoin code, node operators could implement a rule that ignores the attacking chain and agreeing that the defending chain is valid up to a definite block height.  
At most there might be some confusion as some transactions would be reversed and re enter the mempool in the time as consensus was formed as to which is the last valid defending block.

Money is a medium.  It's purpose is to transmit value.  
Following in the steps of other media, whose purpose is to transmit visual, auditory  and text information.  These other media have emerged through stages to the point now that they can performed on a person to person basis with little intermediation.  It is almost impossible to censor any of these media.  
This has led to much greater freedom and much greater well being for us.   
Money as communication really is best suited to whatever transport is most energy efficient, most lossless, and most distortionless.  Up until the breakthrough of Nakamoto, the benefits on these fronts of digital media has evaded money.
Now that we have it, money no longer requires the trappings of sociological tribal symbolism.  It gets recognizability and finiteness from rules that are inviolable by agreement of participants who need not conform to any specific culture or system of jurisprudence.  
Cryptocurrency then is free from state banks, free from morality, free from physicality, free from interference.  
It means a great leap forward in human interaction in the most generic language we have: value.  
It may well be Humanity's most important innovation to date.

Money is a highly interesting topic.  It cuts across so many areas of human life.  Commerce of course, but economics and psychology, history, tribal anthropology.  And then Bitcoin adds information, media, peer to peer networks, open source software.  
Don't take investment advice from strangers on the Internet, but I would criticize your plan just a little.  Bullion is a great complement as ballast to crypto risk and volatility, but there are other asset types that offer cash flow and performance.  Bullion is preservation in the face of disaster.  Crypto is swinging for the home run.  But you need income along the way too.

Sure, but even if all governments were to suddenly go after Bitcoin mining, it would scatter into all kinds of corners hidden by Tor and VPNs.  And even if they eliminated 99% of it over time, the difficulty would drop and miners would spend resources hiding themselves until they got to the point where the cat and mouse game was just a cost of doing business.  
Remember that mining was done on CPUs and GPUs not so long ago.  
Fundamentally mining is not censorable.  Maybe in authoritarian places like Venezuela, but those kinds of places do not last long.

@_date: 2018-10-14 04:03:10
No not really.  
The Bitcoin blockchain has an established community and history.  So if someone forks off in some direction undesired by a large part of the community, then the original chain continues with higher value than the fork.  
This is exactly what happened with the Bitcoin Cash fork.  That proved a whole bunch of things.  The coin that has the attributes desired by the community gets valued.  Miners will follow.  
Miners all had their balls out on the table last year how with 80% of hashrate they were gonna  kill the original chain.  
Well it turns out their balls were as tiny as was predicted.  They fell right into line with the price.

Possession??  Lol

@_date: 2018-10-14 15:25:14
Well, it depends what you mean by update.  
For a code change that is known as a hardfork, the new code breaks some existing rule, so the prior code can't recognize transactions that use whatever the change is.  
In the case of a hardfork, there is then two blockchains.  The old ruleset applies on one, the new ruleset applies on the other and for a few blocks things can be messy.  Both chains share the history up until the time of the fork.  
Since there is no formal compulsion to have a user use one chain or the other, the user community decides which fork has preference, or both.  Ethereum is a hard fork of the original Ethereum ruleset, where Ethereum Classic maintained the original rules.  Bitcoin Cash is a hardfork of Bitcoin.  Note that the community in each case valued one type of path, the opposite of the other example. 
So the community chooses, not miners.  
The miners in the Bitcoin Cash debtate indeed tried to push their power of organized hashrate cartel onto the community.   They failed deliciously and now they mine exactly according to the price which is of course the relative desirability as expressed by the market.  
The short answer is no, miners can not push forks. 
 
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:32:00
So by ignoring it, it would mean a community consensus to fork off back to the defending chain to ressurect the sanctity of the chain.  
Simple as a hardfork that says at blockheight xxxxx (ie near the point of the latest block on the defending chain), the valid chain must have nonce value of yyyyyyyy. The attacking chain would not have that present, the original chain would.  
Chain resurrected, immutable record ressurected, bogus chain ignored.  Community maintained.
Cheap easy.

Exact opposite.  You need futures markets so that debt instruments using Bitcoin can create pricing.  This is a necessary step towards Bitcoin becoming money.  
Bitcoin futures are not Bitcoins.  So what?   
@_date: 2018-10-30 18:23:22
It is not completely corruptible.  In fact, the basic blockchain asset, has never been corrupted even one tiny bit. Every satoshi ever mined is accounted for and not one has come into existence ny any mechanism other than mining.  Completely un-corrupted. 
Bitcoin can not be faked liked fiat or even metals.  It can not be mixed with cheaper things.  It has numeric accounting and can be perfectly verified.  
Yes, Bitcoin is prone to market manipulation, as are all assets. But that doesn't make all of those assets not worthwhile to own.  It is quite possible for big money to create volatility in Bitcoin while Bitcoin has a fairly small liquidity.  I don't think that is the source of Bitcoin price volatility. I think that Bitcoin is going through a price discovery to something much higher than today's price.  It is still up 10X in two years and 100X in about six years.  Since there were markets, it goes through violent parabolic upswings and then people take out their 10X profits and it crashes.  This will continue for awhile yet, I think, so if you can't handle that, don't invest.  
In terms of a medium of exchange Bitcoin is without par. There is no other medium that can transmit as a bearer asset between any two parties anywhere  without any third party intermediation.  Price volatility means nothing if the two parties agree to an amount. Bitcoin can not transmit pricing information because of volatility, but that is not exchange, that is pricing.  
These are amazing qualities.   
Bitcoin is very durable.  I guess one could argue it has not proven that for more than a decade even but should humans continue to use information systems, the Bitcoin blockchain will persist.  Perhaps there are technological threats but none that currently threaten things.  Breaking the cryptographic elements will probably happen, but a new addressing format fixes that.  Some coins that do not migrate will get stolen.  That is an interesting threat, but it is well out on the horizon.

Well I guess if aggregate demand decreases for whatever reason, then sure the price against other goods in demand will decrease.  So sure.  
But that does not support the notion that Bitcoin's incentives based on a fixed supply are somehow material or even "bad" for anyone.  
The value of freedom is so much more important than the potential macro-economic impact of a mild deflationary currency (ie if Bitcoin were highly dominant), or a non dominant, highly deflationary currency (ie if Bitcoin were to continue its ascent)

Worse.  It's not predictive, but still somehow we let Economists take on the mantle of prescriptive fixers.  We let monetary theorists "improve" our individual condition when we are better off doing it ourselves.  
Rather than recognizing that Economics is really a sociological study, it has tried to become an Engineering discipline.  It then becomes grotesquely enforced.  It is ineffective then the unsustainable coercive incentives are doubled down upon to make the herd fit the theory.  
Authoritarianism follows, including the bizarre attempt to stuff down the memory hole the at least 100M deaths directly attributable to Socialism (Russian Communist Revolution =&gt;10s of M, Chinese Communist Revolution=&gt;40M, War between the National Socialists of Germany vs the Soviet Socialists (aka WW2)  =&gt;10s of M).  Or the lack conscientious study of the damage of mispricing financial assets due to central banking.  
The problem with  Keynesian economics is not merely that it is wrong scientifically, but that is wrong morally. It takes away individual freedom to prove itself.  It is an errand monkey for authoritarians. Pablum for the semi-literate masses
This is why when I hear people make weird Keynesist macro economic arguments against Bitcoin, I don't care.  The only effect that State-followers can have on Bitcoin is to try to prevent its use.  That's not an avenue that they can pursue intellectually because it means they have to deny my freedom of conscience to reject fiat and value cryptos.  That is rationally, morally and effectively impossible. Of course these are people that have zero problem with enforcing truth at the barrel of a gun.

Exactly.  Bitcoin is more like a central bank or gold but with ad hoc peer to peer Internet transaction capability. 
Lightning is not Bitcoin.  It is a protocol on top of Bitcoin.  And it is also very useful.  It is an instant high capacity, low trust, asset payment network.  There is no credit aspect like in banking.  
I think we will see various credit systems over top of Bitcoin and perhaps over top of Lightning.  It won't be VISA, etc.  I think VISA will go down with the fiat ship as the interests are tightly aligned and Central Bankers will not let banks or VISA out of the system.

Sure.  In the banking system though, all transactions are credit/debit.  It just depends on whose ledger you are looking at.  Every debit has a matching credit.

I don't think that diplomacy solves anything.  
But I agree with the general thrust of your argument.  
We will attain peace through completely diminishing of "State." The State is a vehicle of power.  All else about The State is to manufacture consent.  Ultimately The State serves the powerful.  We will achieve peace when power has no effect because coordination of administration, security, economy, and caring will have no centre to control. We can coordinate resources fairly and with high accountability without ceding to the idiocy of War.   Blockchain is an important facet.  Money without power is an enourmous first step.

You are playing with semantics. 
No, I have never heard that the Nazi's wanted a soviet system.  But neither did Mao, Castro, Chavez, or Trudeau. 
Your view of things is that Communism is to the left, Fascism to the right.  I think that is delusional, with all due respect.  They are both violent, autocratic collectivist idealogies. Neither respect the individual.  The only people with autonomy are in the ruling group.  Every one else is an insect in the service of the system.  
Without the right to ownership, there is no right to fruits of labor, and thus no right to one's own person, IE there are no rights at all. I guess you are free to give up your freedom, but I will not be joining you. 
So the spectrum for me is between freedom of the individual and collectivism. I don't really care what you want to call them, but indeed the Nazis called themselves Socialists.  I won't deny their idealogies were heinous.  And certainly they were enemies to Soviet Socialsts, both internally and with Russia.  
Nothing in common? Come on. Communism and Fascism have the following in common: collectivism, autocracy, dimunition of the individual, control of resources and industry (though by mildly distinct means), propaganda, control of information, and not leastly mass mass murder of opposition.  
Did Mao, Stalin, Pol Pot, Castro, Chavez, want to democratize anything?  Or did they just kill a significant part of their population in order to gain consent?

You are correct.  And if there wasn't a state enforced monopoly of fiat use, and there were competing forms of money, then inflation and deflation of a particular currency would have no effect on a macro level.  
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:58:54
With all due respect that is backwards logic.  It's not useful as a currency until it is valuable.  
Currently, the primary use case is (speculative) investment asset outside "The System."  That's a spectacular use case! and volatility doesn't really impede it.  
The secondary use case, which is growing, is use as money, ie to transfer value.  Again Bitcoin is awesome for this purpose as long as you can use it in a way that volatility doesn't matter.  So for people who hold it only shortly and transfer it for cases where banks don't work, it is the best money ever created.  For those who invested more than a year ago, using it as money today is still very effective.  
It still is a fairly long way from even the capacity to act as a currency.  The Lightning Network will help alot.  Bitcoin banks, like Coinbase (as they get there) will allow a banking transactional layer over the main protocol which will allow for infinite transactions. 
So, it called a cryptoCURRENCY, but it really is not yet a currency.  
In the meantime, holding is best for the holder and for the ecosystem.  There are those who use it as currency, but that's not where it derives value.

Moot.  
These arguments only matter when the currency in question is in near monopoly to the economy it serves.  This does not apply to Bitcoin.  
With an economy where there are competing forms of money, each money itself must provide relative incentives to its user.  
Legal Tender and other coercive law makes the users of fiat use it, despite otherwise negative incentives.  
The purpose of money is to communicate value.  Not put consumers onto the altar of macro-economic concerns.

@_date: 2018-06-07 03:39:32
Bah, we are agreeing with one another.  
All fiat transactions are a credit/debit ledger entry, even at the central bank.  So, a bank can technically create an infinite number of such balanced transactions.  So for VISA to do many transactions is only a limit of their  impressive IT infrastructure. It's not an impressive accounting technique.  Double entry accounting is hundreds of years old.   
Bitcoin is a bearer asset on a distributed ledger on a peer to peer network.  Bitcoin is a different beast from credit.  The transaction validity is assured because the rules are open and clear.  But before another block is added to the chain, substantial mutual agreement must take place.  So slow and sure is the technique.  Less than 10 tx per second.  
This creates neither a credit nor a debit, but a bearer asset that can be moved between addresses.  Bitcoin is the bearer asset, fiat is credit/debit ledger entries.  I guess it is OK to call Bitcoin debit but I think that confuses things.  
With a bearer asset, we can create a credit/debit service like banks and credit cards with unlimited txs as a "corporate layer."

I guess it depends on one's personal perspective.  
I don't find much to distinguish between the king owning everything (autarchy), or the Communist Party (Communism) owning everything or a close knit partnership between government and elites owning everything (Fascism).  None are anywhere near free markets. 
Fascism is just a shade away from Communism.  Fascism is a form of Socialism.  
Capitalism is an abused term.  As long as Central banks distort pricing through supply of currency we are still a long way from free markets.  Bankers being free of pricing while the rest of us are not is not free markets.  That is the current gestalt of "Capitalism." 
The goal of "Fascism" may well be to crush "Communism" but that is two competing systems devoid of freedom.  Not interested in either.  I want Communism to disappear through individual's just largely giving up on its stupidity.  Do you consider that fascistic?
And with the Internet and cryptos, people no longer have to submit to the fence enclosures of nation states, so systems of non-voluntary participation, while dominant, are doomed.  
 
Note that the vast vast majority of conflict in that war was between the National Socialists (NAZIs) and the Soviet Socialists.  History also supports the argument that the Nazi phenomenon was a nationalistic defense against the expansionary actions of the Bolshevik (globalist) Socialists.  So, again, your point is valid, Fascism is rival to Communism, is true, but not with much merit, as these are obviously just competing forms of collectivism.  
  
Both were based on false promises to their supporters to their personal demise, and both were financed with New York bank money, ie fresh printed Federal Reserve Notes.  Fiat money is blood soaked maggot ridden stench kharma.

@_date: 2018-06-11 18:54:41
It can't be avoided.  
The whole point of fiat is so that the people that control it are not subject to prices like the rest of us are.  Their entire existence is about altering normal incentives.  They openly admit this.  They "stimulate" spending by diluting the value of their notes. They create "wealth effect."   Then they try to maintain that this is not to their benefit.  They do it for you.  Come on.  
It is just a gauntlet that Bitcoin will have to survive.  It will I think. 
Ultimately futures markets will help as it will create the vehicle by which people can create credit mechanisms over Bitcoin.  It is tough to do credit with assets whose price is unpredictable. But with a futures contract, a lender or a borrower can lock in the value of their Bitcoin loan against other assets, so the loan can go ahead without anyone getting badly burnt by a price swing.  
I am not convinced that the futures markets are the cause of Bitcoin's price drop.  I think it's just a snowballing over reaction to the big spike.  If it is due to the futures markets and antagonists of Bitcoin losing money on their futures positions in order to harm Bitcoin price, then there will be a point where one should gorge on the low price.  
Bitcoin has real use case.  It will have value as the native asset. If manipulation makes it cheap, that's a massive opportunity.  I have no idea where that price point is.  
Same for Gold btw.  It's cheap.  But the ability to suppress it will persist for who knows how long.

I get your point and don't disagree.  Talking is preferable to violence.  My point is that "diplomacy" is just war by other means because it is sterile without the power to help/harm the other.  
The purpose for me with Bitcoin (and Monero, and Ethereum and EOS) is to at a minimum have solutions whereby people can freely conduct business without paying for the power ambitions of others because they still carry the talismans of the divine right of king.  A better purpose is to neuter those talismans altogether but I think there will always be many, even a majority perhaps, that will not see that by falling into the religion of The State, that they are getting a poor bargain.  I would like to see a world where diplomacy is as ridiculous as trying to crowdfund a nuclear aircraft carrier: Without the power to force the peasant to give up wages at gunpoint, there is no aircraft carrier and there is no diplomacy.

It's not an easy assessment but there are parameters to consider.  
In particular, there are use cases for demand including ForEx, remittances, darkweb, capital control ducking, offshore asset holdings, gambling, other grey markets, bullion market cap.  
While it is hard to assess how much of these overlap with Bitcoin, it is pretty clear that there are applications and they dwarf Bitcoin's current demand.  
Bitcoin of course is not without its own flaws and risks, but I think all considered, expectations are not unreasonable for several times more increase.

Bitcoin is NOT at all about a stable value, nor even an increasing value.  
It is ALL about storage and movement of value using  a system without third parties.  The storage part of that has always had huge volatilty.  This is a sign that Bitcoin has not found its place in the world.  But the trend is still hugely upwards and there is nothing broken as far as I know.

I hope some day Mr. Antononpolis gets around to discussing money as a medium.  Like newspapers, or radio or TV or the Internet.  I think he missed the mark slightly in this.
Marshall Macluhan, the great Canadian guru of media studies said that a new medium can be identified because the prior media will be transmitted upon it.  The Internet carries text, voice audio, hi fi audio, and video.  The prior media have been overtaken.  It is not unrealistic to see mobile as a new kind of media that the Internet is now carried upon.  
Bitcoin is communication.  If we examine it relative to other forms of money media, it is a world apart.  Bitcoin transmits with perfect digital signal loss-less fidelity.  There is no custodial time distortion or inflation distortion. The signal of a bank transmission is sort of like that child's game of passing a secret around by whispering it one by one to one another.  
We will know Bitcoin is a new money medium when the prior money media use it as transport, say in Forex.  Eventually pricing will be signaled via Bitcoin. It is not so much that there is a new infrastructure necessary to carry the new technology as Andreas says here, it is that the new medium is the infrastructure.  
Bitcoin is the new infrastructure.  
That is why the horse-road-car analogy is a bit weak.

There are some highly important distinctions between Bitcoin and Gold standards.
A Gold standard sucks.  The redeemable representation is a promise by authority to not counterfeit the respective currency.  Authorities lie.  So they go ahead and counterfeit the currency and steal spending power by duping those who trust the promise.  Then the standard has to move the goal posts.  Now there are no goal posts. 
A pure fiat system (ie not backed by even the fake promise of a Gold standard), does not distinguish between the units created by the expansion of the central bank balance sheet, and the units created by the expansion of the commercial/retail banks when credit is provided to the borrower.  
With Bitcoin there obviously is not a Central Bank.  This has significant implications.  
"Authority" is simply an agreement of the software rules and of the content of the blockchain.  The blockchain itself is practically non-negotiable as the market will not accept any doping of the ledger, the market will always choose the pure unadulterated version.  The rules are more easily adapted, but still highly difficult.  There have been many political undertakings that have tried to alter the rules in fashions that they thought to be better.  They have all failed.  If we discount Ripple, Bitcoin has some 60% dominance after 10 years as open source code.  Beyond Ethereum,  all other coins are just experiments.  (I think Ethereum is an awesome experiment, destined to fail, but that's just me).   So this is a radical improvement over a state enforced fraudulent situation where a bank's liabilities must be honoured as money (legal tender law) and the bank has unencumbered control over its balance sheet (ie Fed Reserve independence.)   
Bitcoin is a far sounder authority than a central bank!
Fractional credit will certainly be an important facet of a Bitcoin-only economy (once large, liquid and long term futures markets exist).  But the advantage to Bitcoin over either a Gold standard or pure fiat system is large.  
In a Bitcoin system, the underlying "reserve" asset is verifiable, not counterfeit-able and it is not considered to be identical to the credit-created unit.  A Bitcoin owed contract is not a Bitcoin. It is properly a derivative, which is fine.  A borrower goes to a lender, and borrows 100 BTC, he gets 100 BTC.  The lender gets a contract that the borrower pays 110 BTC in one year.  If the lender itself has a good reputation, and the borrower has a good reputation, that contract is a marketable financial asset unto itself.  The lender can sell that contract, day 1 and receive profit.  Let's say that they can sell it to a buyer for 103 BTC, for an immediate 3 BTC profit and then has the 100 BTC to loan to someone else. There will be markets for  true Bitcoins and for Bitcoin derivatives.  The lender's reputation will partly be based upon the proportion of reserves of true Bitcoins to Bitcoin loan assets, so a lender with a large proportion of reserves can maybe sell the contract for 104 BTC.  So interest rates are risk based.  
This is all exactly as it is today with fiat, but better.  Bitcoin has a sound supply,(like gold), it has trivially verifiable accounting properties (unlike gold), and end user trivially verifiable ownership reserve accounting properties (unlike a fiat fractional credit lender).  So a Bitcoin fractional lending system is far far more transparent, far less falsifiable, and far less risky than either a gold based money or a pure fiat system.  
Note also that in the above, the Bitcoin derivative contract is a financial object and can be traded.  In a pure fiat system these are the asset object created when a bank lends.  The liabilities are what circulates as currency in our economy.  The reason that gold does not circulate as currency is that it is a huge pain to do so.  It is not easy to verify that gold is gold.  It is hard to measure.  It is hard to subdivide to provide a little change for buying bread. It must be shipped to close financial transactions.  Since it is a bearer asset, it can be stolen without recourse en route.  But gold accounting derivatives helped to solve these problems.  This is the ONLY reason that banks, and bank regulation and central banks even exist. 
But Bitcoin removes the need for bank accounting and verification of the underlying asset.  That is all done on the blockchain. Bitcoin is easy to do accounting.  It is easy to verify.  It is easy to subdivide.  It is easy to transport. So while, gold does not circulate as currency, Bitcoin can, even very efficiently on Lightning or other Bitcoin-native objects.  Also Bitcoin derivatives can circulate as currency, even perhaps as blockchain governed assets themselves.
In an unlimited fiat system, when the amount of money needs to increase due to demand, banks create credit.  The problem though is that supply can be manipulated in a fashion that is not really responsive to demand but is perversely seen to create demand, that is the whole bizarre notion that wealth is created by adding to the money supply and thereby lowering the cost of money and creating harmful economic mal-incentives. 
In a pure gold system, demand for money is reflected in the price of the gold. As it would for Bitcoin.  Interest rates create accurate feedback to the economic imperative that must be overcome to afford to borrow, so economic incentives are actually properly aligned.    
It all comes down to a simple question.  You may prefer a Keynesian money economy.  I may not.  
Do you consider it within your rights to keep me from using Bitcoin?  
If it is not within your rights, it is not within the rights of government.  
You or your government forcing me not to use Bitcoin is also not at all practical, so the concern that a deflationary money is harmful at a macro economy level just has no impact.  There is nothing anyone can do to prevent another person from using Bitcoin.  And again to be clear, they would be morally wrong to try anyway.
So the Keynesian macro argument, even if it were not the bunk voodoo that it is, is actually just irrelevant.  There will be enourmous opportunity for those institutions that can properly broker the "legal tender" world that can still be captured by men with guns  and the open source crypto world.
I will go as far to say that the Keynesian bizarro world eventually evaporates due to its own inconsistencies, immoralities and incoherent economics.

If I offer you a 1 in 10 chance to pay $1 for a $100 payout, nine times out of ten, you lose.  But you should 100% of the times take that bet.  So, I think Bitcoin has a 1 in 3 chance of a 30X gain. Something like that.  It's hard to know.  But in no case am I incorrect.  I am taking a position.  If you know a better way to approach life, I am all ears.
If it will help whatever miserable moldy corner of your tiny soul to dance a victory should my estimation prove incorrect, you will only be jerking yourself.

Gold has no cash flow, large valuation.  Speculative land purchase, same deal... "does not end well" is just a cheap way out of not making an argument.  
Website clicks are nothing like what we are talking about.  We are talking about potential large market use cases that assuredly are not proven, but possible.  So the valuation of Bitcoin is still unknowable, but that doesn't make it completely not worth owning some. The monetary mediums that Bitcoin is in some ways highly superior to are valued in the 100s of $T.   Ie Thousands times larger than Bitcoin's valuation.  A 10 to 30X is not a bizarre possibility in time.  I think the probabilities are still highly asymmetrically positive.

Who cares if governments fail or not, really? What I do day to day has zero bearing on the enterprise of government.  
So while people do fail more frequently than government, that is not the decision. It is only and always about "how do I survive and prosper, here, now, in his living moment?" 
So the rational decision is: "If the government fails, what can I do to mitigate that? How do I make the failures of government to be not my problem?"
If Bitcoin helps then you should use it for that purpose.
The US Dollar system is failing.  This is poignantly exhibited by the failings of currencies outside the USD.  This failure of the money system means a withdrawal into USD, but all of the US is bankrupt through and through.  The USD is a short term hedge against other currency failings, but the USD is also in a failure state.

Well you did assert IN CAPS that force WILL ALWAYS ENFORCE WHAT IS MONEY. 
Really very untrue. If governments did not offer some kind of money, money would still exist.  Government does not control money.  Gold has been money since civilization of Homo Sapiens.  In many contexts and even today, and even by governments globally until 1971. 
 Until 1971, governments themselves deferred to gold as money. We are approaching the end of the pure fiat epoch. 
 
They use violence to enforce their preferred token into having value, which is a grotesque application of violence. The acceleration of draconian statehood has everything to do with the end of USD hegemony.

The only vector for attack that I can possibly see is an overwhelming amount of fiat getting thrown into damaging the price.  Then they can competitively mine.  But mining attacks are lame.  
The Bitcoin Cash fork and the preceding debate demonstrated that nodes, not miners, choose the rules.  Double spend 51% attacks are easily defeated by waiting for ample confirmations.  Inserting checkpoints defeats bogus alternate chain attacks. So mining hashpower is an expensive irrelevant attack surface.  Can't change the rules, can't harm the blockchain and can't even double spend.  With a little effort mining attacks are impotent.  
So, if some actor out there wants to create naked Bitcoin shorts, that's just a subsidy to buy it.  It may stretch the time horizon out, but fiat always collapses, so you just have to wait it out.  There isn't a fiat domain on the planet that isn't seriously wobbling right now. Even the USD war-hegemony is meeting serious resistance.  But it could be a while.

I think that is correct. I am hopeful that people do not really need to understand the difference day to day, even if it would benefit them to do that.  I hope that people will just respond to the unadulterated economic signals that they will get through this new medium.  That is to say that profit will flow from properly serving another human, without all the distortion and loss at the hands of banks and authorities.  
The first such signal is simply the payoff in profit to those that correctly speculated on Bitcoin's value, a process that is far from run its course.  Other signals include fringy things like quality narcotics or webcam whoring (I dislike both but respect people's freedoms).  The ICO phenomenon was another fascinating signal.  It was vastly mostly scammy bullshit, but again people were freely offering and participating in equity offerings as the SEC in the US has stated.

@_date: 2018-11-05 21:01:42
There is probably no way to do it simply that doesn't open up a lot of questions.  But...
Turing-complete is a computer science notion, attributed to the famous Alan Turing.  In his day, many primitive computers were not fully expressive, that is they inherently could not run all possible computational instructions.  Today's computers and programming languages are trivially Turing complete, the test of being: is it technically possible to run any possible algorithm in that architecture.  Bitcoin's program-ability is not Turing complete by very conscious choice of the original developer. 
Ethereum added native Turing complete program-ability to a blockchain.  It is a powerful proof of concept but of dubious value quite frankly as it is costly and prone to attack.  It enables full expressiveness which enables the implementation of many forms of traditional as well as new forms of contract between parties without need of court enforcement, a very important development for human jurisprudence, so called smart contracts.  Don't get too hung up on deterministic or
resource accounted or virtual machine.  It all adds up to sound accounting with programmable money.
A two-way peg is a method of tying Bitcoin and the sidechain (Rootstock in this case) monetary constraints together.  This is important so that contracts using the sidechain token are essentially using Bitcoin as their money.  It is a guarantee that the two tokens are in a trustless sense are interchangeable (or low trust in Rootstock's case) and should likely track closely in real world price so really the smart contracts are using Bitcoin and not altering Bitcoin's monetary policy. 
Merge mining means that the Rootstock blocks are discovered and added using existing Bitcoin mining so that that the blocks are as immutable as Bitcoin blocks (ie very).  Rootstock has an element of so-called federation, that is to say that the whole process is not precisely trustless due to limitations in the current state of Bitcoin's technological development.  The "federation" is people, but a group of people that have a strong interest in not cheating the system and (hybrid) a limited ability to affect the operations of the protocol and only in limited and well defined circumstances.  
This overall is a big deal.  What Ethereum has proved is that there is an entire new financial system being birthed.  I think it has also proved that the operations of that system can not happen on the same blockchain as the monetary system.  Ethereum projects are successfully launching tokens as equity, running predictions markets which will act in the future as very high quality actuary, and identity/reputation systems which will become the basis for debt/credit.  Etc, etc, etc, etc.   Both Ethereum and EOS have serious flaws, IMO.  So this approach by Rootstock is one that should really be paid attention to as it captures the pure monetary role of Bitcoin but enables the full expressiveness of Ethereum without killing the premises of the monetary protocol like Ethereuem does.

If he buys Bitcoin in a selling panic and keeps his nads of steel for a few years, he can prove himself to be a great investor by selling into a buying panic.

There is no real systemic problem with Bitcoin. The protocol works fine, the overall infrastructure is still improving quite rapidly.  
The pricing is all due to sentiment.  There was no special good reason for the FOMO boom in 2017, and none for the crash in 2018.  
There is no easy way to know what the price of Bitcoin should be.  There is no way to discount current cash flows against the expected cost of money. There is an apparent strong set of use cases, but they are mostly future oriented.  So sentiment is overly important in Bitcoin.  This creates a positive feedback.  
This will remain in effect until the use cases develop, and the liquidity from a much higher price, better exchanges and futures buffers dampen the feedback that the price gets from itself.
I think the likelihood of Bitcoin completely disappearing is near zero.  There is a real committed community, there is lots of liquidity channels, the protocol is functioning just fine.  
Not all the panickers are irrational, but too many are.

It is not a straightforward situation.  If the world was still all in on Central Bank inflation mode, then Bitcoin's price going up is a no brainer.  
Most of the world's Central Banks are inflating.  Many countries have debts that are contracted in US Dollars.  They made the mistake to assume that the dollar would be perpetually in inflation.  Now, as you said, the US Dollar is in mild deflation.  This cause those countries to come up with USDollars which are scarcer in general terms but quite a bit scarcer than their own currencies.  They then have to inflate their own currencies to pay their USD debts.  This is being exemplified widespread.  
The US Dollar managers are not fully in control of the situation though. There is a lot more debt in the world than is publicly accounted for.  Raising interest rates by soaking up US Dollars will bankrupt alot of individuals, companies, banks and even countries. Alot of bonds will go underwater, alot of mortgages too, stocks will be hit hard, if interests rates gp too high. Alot of "deposits" at banks will be made unavailable or seized.  These assets will evaporate.  
There is so much debt that alot of financial assets must be destroyed (USD deflation) or the US Dollar must be destroyed (USD inflation) or measures of both (middle of the road).  There is no economically sound path out of that.
In which case, assets not held custodially will flourish.  IE Bullion and that Internet money stuff.
I genuinely think that Bitcoin flourishes in any scenario.  In the short term, I think the strength of the USD causes a retraction pressure out of Bitcoin, but that is against a larger swell of fundamental increased inward pressure, with lots of volatility, wheeeee.

These panics have to wring out all the potential panickers.  
Everyone is different.  
Who should hold or buy?  Anyone who rationally thinks the value will go up form here and can also afford to.  
Who should sell? Anyone who is sitting on top of large gains that might evaporate should take some profit (price was $1000, less than 2 years ago). Anyone who rationally thinks the price will go down from here.  Anyone who has too much exposure in their portfolio to this market.  
All of the potential sellers have to barfed out of the market almost completely.  There is still a lot of profit on the table for some and they will be selling, hopefully balanced by rational buyers who want exposure to the asset.  
I think we are just about done with this capitulation.  There is a whole world out there that want to put a few percent of crypto into their portfolios that need big custodial mechanisms to manage it for them. That is near now.  There will, I think be at least some new demand in the next short while.  They are probably entering near a relative bottom.

Forks are not inflationary.  99.9% of them capture effectively zero value; they do not take purchasing power away from Bitcoin.  
The few that do capture value have differentiated use cases from each other.  So that is not inflationary.  
After ten years as an open source project, Bitcoin maintains a large dominance.   If it was as easy as forking to increase the money supply, there would not be dominance.  The dominance looks to increase now, too.  The next several coins in terms of value have serious flaws.  The only one I like is Monero and despite it having a potent use case, it can't muster 1/60th Bitcoin's value.

Governments have never controlled money.
They can't.  The market controls money.  Government simply offers a type of money and then works hard to eliminate competition.  
I have some hope that the people that exist in government are at least somewhat in realization that the Universe is not their play thing.  When they do not, many people expire.  But government is the essence of sacrificing of morality for power, so...
Force only has so much domain. It is not absolute.  To hire a cop aint cheap and nor should it be.  I once read that the average arrest, charging and trial costs about $40,000.  That seems high to me, but $10,000 does not.  
Are you really going to spend $10,000 to prevent a Bitcoin transaction, a few hundred bytes.

Agree that the above is really good.  And your additions add good value too. 
I will add that OP should be corrected on the idea that banks do not really create or store currency.  Their balance sheets ARE the currency, starting with the central bank and then leveraged outward via credit creation.  
The purpose of the Central Bank is on its face.  It is to maintain who owns the banks when they are financially bankrupt.  All other businesses go through an orderly change of ownership from equity holders to debt holders in bankruptcy.  But not banks.  The excuse provided is that this would be disruptive to the economy.  That is false.  The disruption would come because banking is systemically centralized and thus fragile.  The solution is diversity but that just would not do.  
So the purpose of the Central Bank is to ensure that the ownership group (selected through its Machievellian methods) is maintained.  
This gives the Central Bank through their banking partners. enourmous powers to choose winners and losers in industries, to finance players in strategic to themselves industries (why does no one ever speak of Central Banks in the media?), to indebt and then control people, businesses and government.  
This is the quintessential element behind such phenomenon as the wealth gap, the Military Industrial Complex, the bending of perception through the lenses of the NYTimes, CNN, and Facebook, and the mass surveillance state.

The real benefit of being the Fed is to choose who gets to be the winners and losers in the "free market"  by choosing who gets to be the bankers that finance everything.
Perhaps the best benefit is controlling government as interest payments to banks consume a great proportion of taxation.  Then a country is a corporate farm, the government are the employee farmers that the cattle get mad at, but the bank is the owning corporation.  Mooooo!

Just like $4000 isn't death.  That is not sarcasm.  
Bitcoin is in better shape than during the scaling debate last year.  
Politics are non-existent, no altcoins in the rearview mirror (coins 2 thru 9 are all seriously flawed and Monero can't gain relevance for all of its awesomeness), price is several times up in two years, SegWit, Lightning, RSK, all operating formatively, more exchange options, futures markets, ATMs, more retail acceptance, the great wave of awareness that went through the general population with the price boom/bust.  
Futures markets mean credit use case, ICOs mean startup equity use cases, it already has store of value use case, it has medium of exchange without a third legal party use case.  
As if a price boom-crash means much fundamentally.  Still a great potential investment as long as people do not overdo it and are not disappointed if they have full losses on it.
@_date: 2018-11-02 15:16:10

@_date: 2018-12-05 21:14:14
Yeah.  It is a fascinating market development if true.  
It seems patently true in the precious metals markets, that also represent an escape from central bank mailce, so maybe Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is  a much more existential threat than gold though.  It offers the benefits of banks (transportable, numeric accounting) and none of the drawbacks (violence compelled fantasy).
So maybe banks are willing to lose money at a certain rate to naked short Bitcoin's price down.  
It is kind of a psyop. And it will get worse until they meet their inevitable breaking, (the strings are popping already in localized hyperinflations, trade wars, reneged upon government promises). 
But they can go a long way.  Crushing Bitcoin's price will damage any but the most hardy believers. 
They can only go so far though.  They will be massively subsidizing people like me who will acquire it by boatloads at certain price points.

How long do you hold in various price scenarios?  
If this is, as it appears, a crash after a boom, this entry price is good.  But certainly, it could go much lower and then rise to $50,000 in a month.

There is a massive debt problem.  The value of the current fiat value of the debt, CAN NOT be paid from the profits of all human enterprise.  It might be paid from a crazy productivity gain but that is highly doubtful. In interest rate terms, there is no rate low enough to avoid debt default without causing hyperinflation and no interest rate high enough to avoid inflation without causing debt default.
   
So a reckoning is due to happen.  As an individual, there is no way to know what the reckoning will be exactly.  In either direction bank custodial assets are trapped and will be devalued either by "bail ins" or by inflation or plenty of both.   
Everything out of the bank.  Out of debt.  Otherwise you are at the mercy of the merciless central banks.  They are people with ambition with a clear history of using their power to their benefit in a win-lose manner.

It is actually unbreakable.  By anyone with current technology.  There is some thought that as Quantum computing develops, there is some possibility that the cryptographic functions can be reversed.  
There are mathematic proofs that encryption can be done in such a way as to be fundamentally uncrackable.  John Nash, the famous mathematician did those proofs.  He is the anti-Turing, the man who decoded the Nazi cyphers.  
So, you can be skeptical, but the math is very real.  Unbreakable.
Bitcoin private keys are 256 bits in length, a huge number.  These use a one to one, irreversible hashing function to create a public address.  If I send funds to your public address, only you can spend them as long as you are the only one who knows your private keys.  
The unit used as the accounting notion, ie the money, is called a bitcoin.  Software used to manage these things is called a wallet.   
There is a transaction record kept of all transactions.  This is called the blockchain.  This record is kept sound because the system is an open network that can not be cheated. Through these techniques, Bitcoin has solved the primary problem of money, the double spend problem.  Government money solves this problem through heavy handed regulation.  Bitcoin is far far far more elegant and perfect than bank money.  
This is all a simplification.  You need to research some of these terms.  
Bitcoin's cryptographics have never been hacked.  The transaction record is 100.0000% perfect.

Are you asking out of honest curiosity?  You are coming across as an ignorant prick, but if you are honestly trying to understand, I will get into it with you.

Which is his point.  A friend in China has Yuan.  He walks into something like Western Union.  In the old way, this shop has a relationship with a bank.  The shopkeeper uses the internal corporate system to tell the Western Union shop in your town to give you dollar bills because he has received Yuan bills.  But these two shop owners have no trust between them, so someone still needs to transfer Yuan electronically to dollars.  
The intermediary system is arcane to say the least.  It is a web of interlocking bank credit based upon political entities that are quite rivalrous and have no way of really trusting each other. 
Bitcoin replaces all the middle part with awesome elegance.  The two shopkeepers only need to value the Bitcoin or have some way to exchange it locally. Bitcoin is the settlement mechanism for the two shopkeepers but that is invisible to you and your friend.  You used Bitcoin without knowing it. 
Or better yet if you and your friend do Bitcoin, then you don't need any of the in between parts. You provide your Bitcoin address from your phone, or whatever, ten minutes later you have a bearer asset without anyone else being involved.

This is good.  Thanks.  This is why Bitcoin is taking some time to reach mass consciousness. (It is on the verge of doing so however).
Plato is even more relevant than that!
We can thank Plato and his near contemporaries, Socrates and Aristotle, for exploring the nature of knowledge.  
It is interesting to note that the Adam and Eve parable deals with the subject of knowledge and treats it as a curse, the reason that humans have been exiled from Paradise is that they have succumbed to the evil of the temptation to knowledge.  This treatment of knowledge invites perpetual infantile state and self fealty to slavery. "Knowledge is self-destiny and I would prefer to be looked after."  The divine right of the sovereign is to rule because he alone has the knowledge of god.  The others are better off if they just obey.  This was the dominant view of knowledge during Plato's time.
Plato himself fell into this trap as his ideal form of governance was by Philosopher Kings.  
Plato gave us the theory of Forms, where everything in Nature is a non ideal expression of some unrealized meta perfect ideal of that thing.  Somewhere in meta-space exists the perfect tree, that all real trees are imperfect forms of.  
 
Plato himself was doing exploration, but people who adopt his ideas as world view have wrought horrible tragic consequences.  These include Hegel and Marx.  I doubt that Plato would have thought that his ideas should be an excuse for tyranny. His "Republic" ideal is an aristocracy where thinkers make the rules but have no wealth, soldiers protect the rulers and enforce the rules, and everyone else performs the economy within the rules. 
Plato's student, still the most important thinker to date, Aristotle, moved the concept of knowledge to empiricism.  This one development, the shift from Platonic ideals as the basis for knowledge to empirical observation as the basis for knowledge, is the most significant improvement in human thinking that has ever happened.  
We can either accept Nature for what it is through observation or we can accept Truth from Authority.  Empiricism is humble, truth is truth.  Truth from Authority is lies within lies. 
This is completely relevant to Bitcoin. John Nash, Nakamoto and the cypherpunks are disciples of Aristotle.  Central Banks are descendants of superstition, Plato and Marx.  If we can effectively encrypt at the individual level, there is no place for the State, we have observable information at the individual level that we can protect from authority.  
Note especially 4).  Money has value onto itself.  Only metals and Bitcoin meet this requirement.  When people say that Bitcoin is not backed by something else, that is actually a strength of good money.  Bitcoin's value comes from an intrinsically perfect accounting system, the first we have ever had.
Note also that the accounting system of Bitcoin is inherently empirical and prone to observation by the individual.  
Note that the Authority that keeps the fiat ledgers is the same authority that safeguards its "soundness" through the rules it makes and enforces (!!LOL!!) .  The same Authority that self deems its own rulership (though there is no right to rule, there is the right to not be ruled).  This is a guarantee by superstition, that we must trust the pretty papers and the men with guns to look after us. 
Bitcoin may not be the complete answer.  It may be yet defeated in battle.  There may be market or technical attacks that it succumbs to, so one should be cautious in one's approach to it.  
It has however opened a beachhead for money not based upon the superstition of the superior ruler.  
The reason that many of us, myself included, think that Bitcoin is so morally important, is that the fiat fantasy still exists in a world that is real.  Cheap credit (ie printing fantasy notions) must be reconciled to reality with poverty, revolution, and war via inflation, deflation, currency failure, bankruptcy and generally with the failure with purveyed false expectations.   
The history of fiat money includes 100s of millions of human lives in the past 150 years or so and looks to have one more grim harvest, one which may end multicellular life on this planet.  
Etymology of superstition - Latin, to be in place on top of.  
So superstition is literally a form of knowledge placed upon someone, effectively it is a technique of tyranny.

Money has always been what people agree is money.  The many examples are fascinating. The closest analogs to Bitcoin are gold and the money of the Isles of Yap, which use immobile boulders and stories so that ownership is known by the story of who passed it along.
Bitcoin is money if enough people think it is.  At the current price there are millions of people who think so. It has the best properties of money ever used, it is only not culturally accepted very much.  
A "perfect password" keeps people from accessing your Bitcoins.  Not just government, but thieves.  There are lots of uses for Bitcoin.  Hiding Bitcoin from the government of Venezuela is helping thousands from literally starving to death.  
The entire foundational premise of Bitcoin is that it can not be interfered with.  That has held true.  Bitcoin is still too tiny for government to be worried about.  
Only a highly authoritarian government would even attempt to outlaw it. Bitcoin is software and messages which are impossible to interfere with both practically and legally.
Anonymity is a different matter.  Bitcoin is anonymous but it can be correlated to diminish the anonymity.  
Other coins, particularly Monero, are very anonymous.

Michael Pento was right.  Bitcoin crashed three times since then, crashed all the way to 34X.  Gold, not even once did it crash, 0.8X.
If you sold an ounce of gold then and bought Bitcoin, you could sell your Bitcoin today and get 42.5 ounces of gold.

Ah, I see, I thought you were referring to the block finding speed as"inflation" and that was prone to change

This right here.  
No-one knows the future.  If you think this Bitcoin thing will be more valuable, take a reasonable position. Maybe it moons, maybe it dies.  No one knows.  A person can only take reasonable risks.  
Personally, I think it is getting very cheap compared to its potential.  To each his own, but be prepared for any price between $10 and $100,000 and you will be fine.

I wasn't askign about your druthers. 
I am asking, if it does pop up to some number that seems to you to confirm a true upswing, what is your actual plan?

"Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. 
The Bankers own the earth. Take it away from them,
but leave them the power to create deposits, 
and with the flick of the pen they will
create enough deposits to buy it back again.
However, take it away from them, and
all the great fortunes like mine
will disappear and they ought to disappear, for
this would be a happier and better world to live in.
But, if you wish to remain the slaves of Bankers
and pay the cost of your own slavery,
let them continue to create deposits."

You have a good plan for a downswing but what about for an upswing?

Repeat after me:  That will never happen to me again.
BTW, hyperinflation is terrible, large deflation is also terrible.  High interest rates, defaulted loans, lost homes, high unemployment. 
F fiat
