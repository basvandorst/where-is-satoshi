I used to work for a bank. There's thing called course, and non-reourse. That means if you have a check written on C.S, to a C.S account, you can ask for it to be cashed and then deposited (they see funds) .. A non-recourse is a Wells to a C.S. They cant see funds.. Yes, It takes that long, and yes it's by design

I've though about it many times and still don't have a conclusion. We can stay with the predictable norm fed to us by a spoon, or choose to invent our future. People by nature fear change (email, internet, hell even online banking) but this IS the way, and it will be coming. Dont fear it, embrace it.

...Start with the Kiosks...thats what people are used to.. It's been done before, I know, but kiosks are easy to reprogram. Sure we've done ATM's and such, but I'm thinking we should go after the movie-goers... Fandango.. you can buy  movie tickets at the moment, you dont have to wait in line, and usually get like a free popcorn or something... talk to Fandango and incorporate this feature, should be kinda easy

honestly? doge. The reason beig is that I can re-tip others at at a lower cost, the numbers are higher (people think in numbers) ... what sounds better to someone just coming into crypto.. a .46 tip(btc) or a  676,773 tip (doge)?
