Well basically it's a wallet you print out, it can't really be hacked because it's on a piece of paper. What I do is go to  and right click and download the whole site onto my computer. Then I disconnect the internet and generate a paper wallet and print it off. Be sure to delete all the files afterwards though leaving no trace before you reconnect to the internet.

Bread wallet is not a safe place to store your coins because mobile devices are not safe by their nature. I have breadwallet too with a fraction of a bitcoin on it for spending money but the rest should be on paper wallet or trezor.

There are accelerators you can use, I had my coins stuck for a week and had to use one to free my BTC.

I would suggest CP Rochester's Augustin Children's Center, they do great work with little people with developmental issues, they did wonders for my son. They could actually use the funds to build a Track system in their gym to help people learn to walk who otherwise can't under their own weight. Here is there website  . They do not have a bitcoin address on their site but they can put one up or send you one. A few years ago we built a ZipLine for the kids after our son passed away ( they loved it and it really made a big difference in getting the kids to use their upper bodies to have fun. PM me if you'd like me to have someone from there contact you, thanks. Oh and if you donate we will also match your 1 BTC with .1 BTC as the quoted cost for the system was $18,500.
