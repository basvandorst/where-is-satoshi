Lol I just started man, just wanted to find a way to do it directly online, but unfortunately that's not the case :/, how did you acquire your first BTC's?
@_date: 2014-12-05 08:17:29
I have never called something this, but this screams FAKE. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:38:10
I think all cryptos (or most) use it when they are surging faster than a 11 year old going through puberty. It applies to all alts too.
@_date: 2014-05-19 22:54:34
This move is...ahem.....*earth shattering* 
@_date: 2014-04-23 21:43:07
Still at the bottom, need a better ladder buddy.

They love to gamble, this shit is perfect for them. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 03:32:47
They shouldn't. Bitcoin is yet a very unstable monetary instrument and executing the transactions poses a huge financial risk to the company. Also, holding bitcoins is very insecure in such that the coin has not developed an entity that can store such value in a way that is secure and insured (ie banks). Unless Amazon finds a way to safely store their coins, or deploy such services in a confined scale, I don't see it happening.

Holy fuck, I want to move to Australia now. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:33:00
To be honest, Bitcoin is *kind of* volatile these days. Is their any solution to maybe how to stabilize it? Will having more users of the bitcoin currency somehow make the rise and fall margins potentially smaller?
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:31:25
This should be taken seriously and I'm seriously considering being a part of your proposal
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:38:47
Guys he gets it, don't be so rude.
@_date: 2014-05-01 07:57:27
Alright, hey man thanks :). 
@_date: 2014-05-11 20:50:56
You have no idea what you are talking about. Fiat is one of the most stable modes of income, and bitcoin is still very unstable. Its not a good idea to accept payments solely based on Cryptos.
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:17:29
OK thank you, I'm really new to this, I'll check it out!
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:15:51
Hello! Is this method called cash deposit? How did you do it exactly?

Ahh....never thought of that. Hope Sal covers BTC soon ^_^
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:16:53
And there's *reason*. Yawn next. TO THE MOON. Next. What do you really want to see? Honestly, I have never gone against hivemind mentality but here it goes: This subreddit is inundated with unsupported optimism rather than constructive criticism regarding a currency that has so much potential, so much risk, and so much value. Its detrimental, and its sad. I think I ask too much if I just maybe want to see a subreddit likes of or where quality posts are made and quality discussions are said. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 04:13:45
Thanks! Seems interesting, you seem pretty well informed on this subject.
@_date: 2013-10-23 23:31:36
It will crash; people will lose money, and the timer reset. Unlike the crashes in the past, this crash will benefit us in the long run. The chinese are involved, and more markets opening.

Get parents involved. You sound pretty mature and level headed for an 8th grader. Good job, and keep up the good work bud :)
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:54:43
Do not sell, please wait of it to drop and rise again. Buy more when it comes back again. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:08:33
Amateur Trader here. Bitcoin has potential, but sooner or later that surge will lvel off, and you will see a pattern just like with our graphs back in February. Human behavior is predictable.
@_date: 2013-10-22 04:45:58
Very dumb question: What is arbitrage?
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:35:41
So um...for *clarification reasons and scientific curiousity* what is this new website he is talking about and its address?
@_date: 2013-10-21 03:45:56
Thank you! This is amazing, I can see now that the buys and sells usually even out. One question: This intrigues me of the profitability on trading bitcoins. Is it a viable option?
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:08:37
Ahhh I see, thank you so much! Arbitrage only seem profitable with large sums of cash at hand. :/
@_date: 2013-10-22 06:06:46
Funny, but by asking this *I am using my resources at my disposal ya know* 
As a newbie, I don't really feel this sub-reddit so welcoming.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:00:23
Short term: Bubble
Long Term: Proof that Bitcoin is in fact growing. The ups and downs is just what I call economic puberty. Its still finding its place.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:52:51
Easy to say, but harder to implement. You have to deal with social consequences and fight with different political ideologies held by different politicians. The American society has been conditioned to dislike  drugs and the idea of allowing will be a tad too absurd. We should not *legalize* the drugs, rather than to *decriminalize* them. Make it easier to obtain and consequently let drug users have easier access to treatment centers and rehabilitation opportunities. I believe by decriminalizing the the use of drugs we can lower the rate of crime related to drug use and drug trade. Make the sale of drugs illegal through public trade and only legalize through government controlled and approved stores/centers. Let the Government establish a "Drug Administration" where all drugs are checked by its quality and its purity. Through this we can finally acknowledge that drug use is a common human activity and also acknowledge drug use as a real danger to a person's health. In order to reduce drug violence and use we must always be one step ahead of the system. This does not mean to go against the substances in a full scale "war" but rather execute policies that are socially beneficial, cheap and effective. (see Portugal). 
The reason why our government is so incapable and hindered in its decision making and execution of its policies is the culture that we the public and our leaders have established. Keep divulging ideas that may sound good on paper, but is actually rather horrible and ineffective in real life scenarios. Politicians are just politicians- just that, trained and conditioned to debate, argue, and decide on matters given to them without much thought. What we need in the Political field is people with leadership skills *as well as* experience in what they are dealing with and an area of expertise when they are making policies that could make or break a nation. I think that Reddit's counter culture and government ideology is well justified, but in order to actually make change and influence not only our future but also our children and grandchildren's, we should take a logical step back from our state of being and decide collectively on how we could make our society a better place. We tend to conceptualize a government as an evil body of special greedy white people, but realize that people in power are elected by *us* and they too are part of our society. We all contribute, let us all make change cause a little ripple in the water so when we combine, it will be a tidal wave of change, reform, and revolution.
That's just my two cents. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 13:38:40
Clearly you haven't read the title?
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:05:33
Why yes it does. Yes, any idiots can make these predictions, but sometimes you just maybe have to listen to those idiots as food for thoughts eh? I'm not asking you to believe me and I'm not touting myself as a market guru, I'm just here to add to this subreddit that it has been going down a get quick rich mentality. Its worrying, and I am only presenting my post as, again, food for thought. Theres a tulip phenemona going on right now, and Bitcoin is bound to fall if some mishap happens. Its volatile, risky, and dangerous if one invests an inrecoverable amount of currency into it. The point is here: to be aware and be vigilant with current trends. You can do whatever you want, but don't lose out on purely bad mistakes. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:20:08
If the value rises so much, we should divide and name smaller individual partitions to said bitcoin, such as:
dBit- Decibit- 1/10 of a bitcoin symbolized by (* BTC)
cbit-centibit- 1/100 of a bitcoin symbolized by (** BTC)
and so on 
5 BTC- Pentabit- symbolized by (
10 BTC- Decabit- symbolized by (
100 BTC- Centabit- symbolized by (
1000- Megabit- symbolized by ( BTC)
The BTC symbol system will work like this, for values less than 1, there will one * symbol added to every tenth value, and # for every tenth value greater than one. There will be an additional ^ symbol characterized for five or more # symbols. I.E ^ equals  while # ^ equals 4 and ^ # equals 6 of the # symbols.

Your welcome
@_date: 2013-10-21 03:35:14
If limit order set the price, then won't prices tend to fluctuate dramatically? OH, I want this much for that amount of bitcoins. Then the other guy says, I will over this amount of BTC for this minus 30%! Its all going up and down. What evens it out?
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:19:42
Nobody. Not you, or him, or that guy down the street. I don't decide, I *estimate*. And for God's sake, I can tell you that BTC is definitely overvalued. I can't tell you by how much, because I'm not a genius, but I can tell you that based on its true relative "value" (based by its use and and its user base and potential), its not worth $1K. Its just a relatively commodity, not a currency. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:13:03
Did I say that I was an adviser? Surely tell me. Normally, I tend to appreciate disaggreements or negative responses, but theres somethin' special here. I'm not an adviser, but I can smell immaturity. How old are you? 13? 15? 16? Your tone really reveals it, as you don't understand the full nature of this post: I am here to *add to the discussion* not commanding or ordering you to do something. This subreddit is filled with so many people, who have no idea what they are getting into, that any post that shows hints of "negatively" is suddenly badgered by teenagers who don't know sh*t. I"m sorry if this comes off really negative and mean, but seriously, please do at least reply with a better constructed response. That's not advice. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:33:07
I've been downvoted over and over again, but honestly, are we going through a bubble rise right now? 
Its so frustrating to see how sensitive redditors are. NO OFFENSE :?
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:23:38
That is poure speculation. Bitcoins will continue to expand if and only if no government regulations be put into place with its protocol, and nothing drastic happens to the number of trades. If Bitcoins continues to grow and expand at this pace, this currency will a very influential economic factor to the global economy within 7-10 years. Now we must discard our ecstatic feelings of LET'S GO TO THE MOON and step back for a second to examine the viability of Bitcoins
A) Bitcoins is a commodity item- much like gold, silver, platinum, Bitcoins can be traded and invested with higher long shot investment returns. Bitcoins has shown its potential to be secure and reliable traded item, this leading to its growing popularity. The rise (The Climb of 2013) we are experiencing right now is the result of a high influx of interest from foreign markets. That rise will most certainly fall I.e. bubble effect, but the end result is Bitcoins will fall back to a higher low volume demand than previous bubble bursts. As stated in precious comments, I call this economic puberty. I don't like to use that term, but I feel it is most suitable for this situation. As we all may know, puberty is a period of rapid growth, leading to ups and downs and other vulnerable symptoms. What we are experiencing today is an example of a sudden up  and down ,proving that btc is in fact growing and beginning to stabilize. Up 3 down 2, up 3, down 2......
B) Bitcoins has proven itself to become a reliable and secure form of currency. The system and protocal we see today within Bitcoin is unlike any other economic system we have seen before. It's new, it's scary, and its downright exciting. We have a currency that is not vulnerable to sudden inflation and deflation (by way of authoritative forced settings) at is secure against attacks, and is near fool proof against fraud. The Bitcoin syst,e is driven by an endless cycle of transactions and block mining, thus forcing it to advance every second. It has potential. If expanded carefully through merchants and more investors, Bitcoin in the future will become a powerful leverage in global foreign exchanges. Although not as likely, I hope one day we will go on mt. Gox and check the price of usd vs. btc, instead of the other way around.
C) With both the power to become a commodity item and a currency, Bitcoin has a lot of headroom to expand to. In order do it to be accepted as a currency, btc will need to be valued at more than 1300 to be aviable option. At this rate of growth, we can expect to see this value to be achieved by 2015
Side note: Do not buy now. We will hit a bubble burst soon, and wait a few more weeks for it to be stable enough to put large investment in. remember people, we are dealing with real money here.
