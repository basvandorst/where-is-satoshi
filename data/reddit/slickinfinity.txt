Civil disobedience is a beautiful thing. 
Imagine a ban that is almost impossible to enforce if enough people decide to ignore it.

They did not seem harmed at all. Chances are they will probably live longer than a mouse in the wild and die of old age rather than eaten by an owl or snake. 
They don't force them to race either and some races were hilariously long because of that. 
Mario definitely loves the attentio!

Bitcoin if used properly could be the most peaceful way to engage in massive civil disobedience. If enough people turn their backs on fiat the system will have to change.
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:50:57
This is where massive amounts of civil disobedience would be completely and morally justified.
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:16:22
Its easy to hide if you try. Use bisq. To sell or another decentralized way and there's nothing they can do to stop it. It's very very difficult for them to find out and if more and more people use this as a form of civil disobedience you could really fk things up for the system. 
I am in the camp that thinks btc should be weaponized against the fiat system.
@_date: 2019-07-18 19:25:03
I think it's a possibility and imo so morally superior to any violence that the old money clings to for its monopoly.
@_date: 2018-09-12 03:24:36

Fud at its finest! I bought plane tickets, hotels, played poker , sent money and made some bets all legal where I am. 
Most people buy drugs with cash and cash is still easy to launder. 
This is almost as stupid as the piece I read on financial times asking for cryptocurrency to be outlawed!

I use btc and other cryptocurrency for purchases all the time. 
Lots of merchants accept it and when traveling it can be cheaper and safer to carry. 
For example when I went to the Philippines and had to pay outrages fees every time I had to convert currency or use my cards. 
Last trip I used rebit and btc to save hundreds in fees and could convert btc to php at the proper rate for a 75 peso fee which is just over 1$ on transactions up to 150k php. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 19:54:38
Fk freewallet. I will never use and I'll let anyone know how their wallet is a scam. 
Making him.show id is ridiculous and hopefully your identities are found out and you get charged with fraud. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:43:44
That sucks and sorry you got scammed. I would start selling small 100 200 amounts to some buyers with 200+ 99% or higher feedback and you should have no problems. 
The only problems I had was a few etransfers sent to me got blocked by the banks! 
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:49:12
How did you get scammed on localbitcoins? 
I've sold a lot there and only accept etransfers from high feedback buyers. 
@_date: 2019-11-21 03:28:06
Shakepay or bullbitcoin in Canada. Shakepay cashout takes about an hour after you convert to cad and they will etransfer you the money.

This might be the worst piece of crap I have ever read and wreaks of the rankest bs possible. Was this written by some butt hurt sob that missed out on btc? Governments need to realize they serve us and if the public wants a useful tech like cryptocurrency then nothing short of oppressive laws will stop it.

That'd be worth hiring laywer for sure. Either that or a team of hitmen lol. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 14:23:31
I disagree and think they dropped the ball not making it illegal years ago. Now its too widespread and global. 
One country can ban it and 2 more will embrace it if even just to spite country one. Its hard to enforce and them making drugs/alcohol illegal just created a black market. 
I also dont think they have the right to ban digital currencies or tell me what I can or cannot consume. If anything we need a ban on stupid corrupt politicians!! 
@_date: 2018-06-03 17:58:45
I oppose paying taxes om my cryptocurrency the same as i oppose most other bs laws. Just because they say so doesn't make it right and they are the criminals im my eyes.  
I also see cryptocurrency as one of the best ways to use civil disobedience to its maximum. 
It's non violent and completely peaceful and the more people that switch from fiat to crypto will help destroy this corrupt system. 
I actually believe that the 1% currently in charge could lead to our extinction through their greed and negligence if not stopped soon. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:23:46
Paypal sucks balls, dirty rotten balls ! 
I completely boycott paypal and I do think they're not liking crypto so ill use crypto!

Imo it's the best one now but also remember your keys your coins and I wouldn't keep my btc or eth there. I transfer to safe wallet immediately and after quadriga I dont mess around.

Vote for a puppet? Party politics is a joke and I could morraly support  civil disobedience  to our current governments. 
I see the need for people to step up and demand better leadership. 
Do you realize how many people have died through wars, disease and famine since 2000?
Millions! The un is useless and the imf enslaves resource rich "poor" countries and the usa bombs the shit out of anyone the oligarchs demand. 2008 1.8 trillion dollars in theft from taxpayer to bankster. 
There's lots more and I could go on but my point is that our leaders are more insane than my rantings lol! 
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:10:44
Doesnt mean I'd comply. Btc is one thig they cant take unless you give ut to them.  
@_date: 2018-06-03 14:18:38
No matter what I'll still use it. I honestly wish people would revolt and tell these governments to fk right off. 
I think cryptocurrency might be the best non violent way to take some power back. 
The more people using cryptocurrency the less power centralized banks have and I will gladly break laws I dont agree with.

Same boat man. I just had to sell over 25% to as I got hit with lots of expenses. The good part was that I definitely didn't sell at a loss.

For me owning btc is civil disobedience and if btc keeps growing the centralized system will lose power to the more fair decentralized system.

If I thought down I'd say a shoryuken but imo we're not far from the turnaround. If crypto devs  all decided to quit I might worry. 
Won't let speculators who can't code and whales who pump and dumps on chumps stop be from seeing that bitcoin is still a huge success. 
Regardless of the price bitcoin is growing in usefulness. 
@_date: 2019-06-20 17:04:18
This is why I think civil disobedience should be used. 
I never gave the government permission to tell me that I cannot buy or sell bitcoin and if they aim to take that right away then they lose all credibility with me and only hold authority over me through their monopoly on violence.

I love bacon, beer and scantily clad women so islam just isnt compatible with my lifestyle. I'm also very thankful that I do not live in a Muslim majority country where I'd be arrested and killed for just my beliefs! Publicly beheaded in some and the fact death is called for to anyone who leaves the cult. 
I am 100% against everything islam stands for abd thankfully I feel free free enough to express my opinion. 
I genuinely feel sorry for the oppressed women who are treated like property and breeding stock. 
Would earth be better off without islam? Honest question.

Even without sharia law Islam is a cult that has done more bad than good for the progress of our species.

Do you really think that the bankers and their puppets will just let the plebs create their own fair hard currency?
@_date: 2019-12-28 05:30:07
It definitely seems the trolls are out in force. There might actually be a coordinated attack going on too by some moron Sam Smith and his group of knuckleheads through spam reporting Youtubers. 
Also today Google just took metamask off their playstore and if you did into the government affiliations Bakkt has I'd say cryptocurrency is straight up under attack.
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:11:47
No I've accepted the fact that some groups of people are indeed my enemy and is anything I said about Islam incorrect? 
Islam will never do more than be a hinder to actual progress and most of the achievements claimed by islam like inventing 0 are b.s. as they just stole as they conquered. 
Early islamic generals were very successful warlords and that's the only reason islam even exists today.

My unprofessional guess is wallets and storage of cryptocurrency is too complicated still for the average idiot. 
It took my a while to learn different wallet functions and secure storage. 
Even I sent coins to the wrong place and lost some to stupidity and that causes stress and some will get turned off and then turn others off. 
Im here for my hate of banks so ill support cryptocurrency even at a loss. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 15:59:51

Because our economy is run by crooks who are involved in every vile act one can think of. 
In 2008 I was hoping people would have made more noise when the government stole 2 trillion dollars and gave it to the banks! 
I thought that theft justified a straight out revolt. 
Income tax in my opinion is an unjust theft of wages someone's forced to earn in order to exist in the economy. 
Most people don't have a choice but to work, so when you take money from an already struggling family to pay for wars for profit, and then line the pockets of defense contractors we have a problem! 
So basically our government is a corrupt piece of shit ripping us off at the behest of the 1%.
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:20:26

My wife is fascinated with cryptocurrency after I showed her how it works and we used it many times to travel. 
As long as you don't ramble on she'll probably think you're intelligent for having an investment. 
When I demonstrated a real use of btc to her is when she fully supported my cryptocurrency investing.

Glad you asked. First we used btc to book hotels and flights and while in the Philippines  using Rebit only cost me about 1$ to send myself any amount. All i did was send btc to them and they sent pesos to either a bank or palawan which are on every block. 
I now play poker on nlc2 and that's cheaper than pokerstars. 
Cheapair.com takes cryptocurrency for flights and hotels. 
If I sent my wife pesos before her pr was approved I used rebit.

@_date: 2018-04-17 21:38:22
They haven't stopped me from using it? I found a few tricks to getting btc fast and even to sell. 
I've gone on vacation using 99% cryptocurrency and saved hundreds in fees plus I can have more than 10k anywhere I want and no risk of confiscation at the airport.  
I'm very confident we'll win in the end. 
If countries got along and all came after cryptocurrency I'd be worried, but if Japan and Korea legitimise it and Malta sets up big bases of operation its becoming "too big to fail" lol. 
I'm not the only one who wants to see the banks collapse or get severely neutered. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 06:02:27
I never said anything was guaranteed. Even fiat could collapse and stocks could dip and cryptocurrency is no different. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 21:12:36
Even if that happens I'll still hold into cryptocurrency because they're not going to stop it only slow it down but even that could backfire on them. 
It's much harder for them to do this stuff and I honestly don't think it would take much to push us over the edge today and end up in a revolution. 
What I want to see is a way to get these parasites away from our cryptocurrency and they can fkn keep fiat. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:55:10

@_date: 2018-04-21 06:07:00
