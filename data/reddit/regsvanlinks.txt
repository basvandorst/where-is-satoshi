How much has bitcoin devalued in the past year?
@_date: 2014-12-17 06:09:38
Wouldn't they have to continually update the price throughput the day though? 
@_date: 2014-10-03 11:37:39
This is good for bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-11-16 09:37:23
I thought bitcoin is a currency? Don't you guys treat it as a currency?
@_date: 2014-10-20 11:31:14
Instead of whining and whinging why don't you get a job you brat. 
@_date: 2014-11-05 12:57:47
It's hilarious reading the comments made by users. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:15:37
You are so cool. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 04:34:06
Welp, this has convinced me to never use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-11 09:36:46
Sounds like a cult. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:11:35
Why do they have pictures of neckbeards on them? 
@_date: 2014-10-03 05:58:03
Bitcoin will literally change the world and topple governments, one bag of groceries at a time. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 08:08:48
Holy shit your username. Hilarious 
@_date: 2014-11-11 13:04:34
Why do I have you tagged as "Tells people to kill themselves"? 
@_date: 2014-12-29 05:29:04
How do you know someone is a programmer?
Don't worry, they'll tell you. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 10:03:00
Wow. 5 cents. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 11:49:48
That guys' voice is so irritating. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 12:19:10
I was talking about your suggestion of spamming YouTube with bitcoin evangelism. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:03:39
Remember: bitcoin is totally a currency and not a pump-and-dump at all : ) 
@_date: 2014-11-17 15:27:17
Why? 
@_date: 2014-11-16 09:49:16
Yes because Africa is one big dump of a country. I mean just look at this shithole: 
@_date: 2014-12-07 13:56:32
How much easier was it compared to using a credit card? 
@_date: 2014-11-03 13:50:13
Bitcoiners really are pathetic, aren't they? 
I wish they would stop spamming reddit with their useless tips and "Woah, what happened here?" comments. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 07:31:12
What a bunch of dickheads. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 11:39:51
Not as easy as using your credit card. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 08:26:46
Shhhh. No tears, only doge. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 11:39:06
I want to be paid with real money. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 18:21:09
A receipt is proof of purchase. I use them a lot for business travel claims. And yes, that includes doughnuts. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:29:43
Holy shit this subreddit is like a cult. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:07:46
How much value has bitcoin lost in the past year? 
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:39:39
That's cos everyone is laughing that asses off at the price drop. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 07:25:06
mods should start removing all these negative posts. Seriously, how pathetic are these trolls? 
@_date: 2014-12-26 09:24:09
Then why doesn't he just invest in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:39:51
What are you doing? 
@_date: 2014-11-16 12:48:12
I do and yes I understand that you should save money. But I get the feeling that OP and the majority of users commenting have little interest in using bitcoin as a currency and are more interested in waiting til they can sell at a profit. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:07:30
Your comparison doesn't make sense. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 06:30:08
It's hilarious that bitcoiners are actually defending this guy. It really does say a lot about and bitcoiners in general. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 07:54:33
Get off your high horse. People make accidents. Is this nazi Germany or an Internet forum? Get your shit together. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:17:52
Tl;dr: He called for a vote brigade and vote manipulation by saying that any positive/good bitcoin comments should be upvoted and any negative comments should be downvoted. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 18:17:32
So the point of this post is to trick others into gambling their fiat away? 
@_date: 2015-01-18 11:41:18
Yep. I agree 100%. Bitcoin is like the internet. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:11:35
What are you on about? He clearly called for a vote brigade and vote manipulation. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:07:34
is going to massively brigade and vote manipulate that IAMA.
@_date: 2015-01-28 04:20:26
@_date: 2015-01-21 12:55:18
Lol that's the blockchain for you. No privacy, everything you do is out in the open for the public to scrutinise. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 06:35:03


not a cult not a cult not a cult not cult 
@_date: 2015-01-12 08:19:43
You sir, are a gentleman who has single-handedly vanquished the trolls. 
I tip my fedora to you. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:36:07
4 for $999.99 is a bit overpriced, isn't it? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:41:39
@_date: 2015-01-19 10:49:49
What's your point? The majority of people tip pennies. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:21:50
He asked to brigade and vote manipulate his iama post. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 10:56:34


As someone who lives in South Africa and who has travelled throughout Africa I'd like to know how you arrived at that number. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:29:49
You must be terrible with money if those things continually happened to you over a lifetime. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 09:37:56
Yep. And that is vote manipulation and brigading which is against reddit's rules. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:06:13
Don't you have a bank card or a credit card?
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:45:50
Woah, what just happened here? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:53:30
OP: "I bought in at $1000, please buy some bitcoins you idiots, I need the price to go up before I can dump." 
@_date: 2015-01-19 03:34:16
This is just sad. Is this what has become?
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:38:49
More regulation is definitely needed. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 04:32:56
What a massive waste  of energy. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 05:00:54
That's either a lot of delusional thinking or it's investors trying to pump&amp;dump.
@_date: 2015-01-11 05:52:19
Vote brigading and vote manipulation are against reddit rules. Reported. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 07:22:32
That's pretty weird. It's like keeping an image explaining credit cards on your phone and showing it to your friends and family.
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:29:30
How exactly? He asked to vote brigade and vote manipulate. That is against Reddit's rules.
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:50:08
Please don't spam. It's not cool. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 03:38:43
Are you talking about bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-03-03 03:36:36
To be fair bitcoin and racism go hand in hand.
@_date: 2015-03-06 09:14:39
I'm a barber as well I accept bitcoin please send me some money. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 03:40:33
Rather tell them to invest in an index fund with Vanguard. It's a far better investment.
@_date: 2015-03-03 05:56:37
Huh? You certainly can get a bank account as a 10 year old. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 04:17:45
Well bitcoin and libertarianism/an-capitalism go hand-in-hand, and libertarianism/an-capitalism and racism go hand-in-hand. Ergo bitcoin and racism go hand-in-hand.
@_date: 2015-03-06 09:18:33
If you are that familiar with supply &amp; demand then surely you should know that pump &amp; dump works on the principles of supply &amp; demand? 
@_date: 2015-03-06 05:45:12
It's so cute that you and your friends have made up your own little play country :) 
@_date: 2015-03-06 09:05:40
Only if bitcoiners can pump the price up enough so that they can dump for a healthy profit.
@_date: 2015-02-24 11:17:41
Why stop there? 
Why not be your own doctor? 
Why not be your own structural engineer? 
Why not be your own grocery store? 
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:43:02
Because they don't want to lose 50% of their money in a week? I dunno. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 14:55:04
You do realise that bitcoin is even less anonymous, dont you? 
Jesus christ. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 06:19:21
Woah, what just happened here? 
@_date: 2015-02-26 07:41:19
In this moment I am euphoric. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 11:10:46
Are you hoping for another pump so that you can dump your coins? 
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:39:03
Do you need those to move credit and debit cards around? Do you need those for internet banking?
OP you're not very smart, are you?
@_date: 2015-02-10 13:47:39
Good guy PayPal. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 05:22:22
That teller's name? 
Albert Einstein.
@_date: 2015-02-13 11:29:28
Not a cult 
@_date: 2015-02-27 09:29:41
Why do bitcoiners always put those creepy smilies at the end of their sentences? 
@_date: 2015-02-03 12:11:14
Hopefully the next big pump is coming soon :) 
@_date: 2015-02-14 16:32:18
Why are bitcoiners so cultish? 
@_date: 2015-02-23 06:26:25
Why do bitcoiners always put those creepy smilies at the end of their posts? 
@_date: 2015-02-17 03:37:21


You... you do know what the blockchain is right? 
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:24:53
You should be able to get your money back through fraud protecti... Oh wait 
@_date: 2015-02-05 11:19:30
And to think actually defended this scumbag. It really does say a lot about this subreddit and bitcoiners in general. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:08:40
You do realise that bitcoin has more wealth inequality than fiat?
@_date: 2015-02-13 10:16:35
It's so cute that they told your daughter about magic beans :) 
@_date: 2015-02-16 11:54:55
You're dad is just humouring you. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 14:14:20
Why do bitcoiners want to give everything "some love"? 
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:33:54
I cannot believe this sucker gave him $35!
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:43:30
You are a goddamned idiot.
