Nice! Is that the convenience store next to Elbow Room?
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:09:29
Yes I paid for the month and am about to subscribe for the year. I think it’s very useful. Except with the slight price differences on Binance, but I just subtract a bit from the price listed in the app. That’s not a big deal for me if it’s off by a little bit because I really enjoy the app.

So when is this lightning network coming so we can stop hearing about bch keep sustaining ATH’s?
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:33:16
Exactly, I also just checked with a close tax accountant of mine and he’s researched everything with the new tax bill and said it’s all the same, just either report capital gains or income whichever tax bracket is less.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:15:32
It’s only going to keep rising when tradeable on coinbase, wouldn’t you think?
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:06:04
Ok cool thanks for the feedback ��
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:00:01
Haha whys that? It tracks every dollar or my portfolio... You have another recommendation?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:07:59
I understand that but do people just not care about putting their money in this thing if it’s a scam? I’m just stating the obvious by looking at what’s going on
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:17:33
I wish I were a village idiot
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:49:09
Do you know anymore info on this new tax for cryptocurrencies? Like how much are profits taxed? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:50:54
I’m in Florida and got mine straight from the ledger nano s website in France. Received in like 5 days I believe. Was actually surprised it came so quick.
@_date: 2018-09-02 00:41:48
You rollin dawg
@_date: 2018-08-08 02:24:41
The only manipulation I see is the SEC delaying decisions. Complete BS! 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:14:47
There’s no more money left to buy more you idiot
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:31:18
Interesting ��
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:39:06
5 minutes in and no lift off yet
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:48:54
I wouldn’t 
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:10:18
Considering it’s down past the lowest level in January, yes this is scary. I’ve been in since August.
@_date: 2018-06-15 23:51:16
If it breaks $5k then I’ll probably start crying
@_date: 2018-06-18 03:10:11
Awesome I appreciate it. Let’s try to push for $20k tomorrow ��
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:13:18
Which would be around a 15-20% tax for capital gains correct, or is there something different with this new bill?
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:50:54
It seems as if the volumes are only rising when the price is going down
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:05:25
What do you think about the mt gox situation today saying they aren’t going to sell any more, isn’t that a really good thing?
@_date: 2018-06-15 23:35:14
Yup, I have a feeling we’re in for a badddd weekend
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:01:59
I’ve always been super careful with my money and never took any risks or previous investments, so I wanted to finally take a chance. As far as a goal, I couldn’t really say but definitely in it for the long haul.
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:28:34
Somebody must be living under a rock
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:49:21
Educate me on hash rate and how that can somehow help this price?
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:34:12
I guess this is good but nobody cares today
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:43:40
I bought a majority of crypto when bitcoin was around $4k, so I’m still up quite a bit. It’s just a little unsettling to see the smallest of bad news send this market down so fast
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:53:25
Haha I know right, always happens that way
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:22:37
Wow, basically said “your move USA” ��
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:33:24
I wonder if he changed his mind after today’s bloodbath
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:25:42
Best place to buy and sell would be on coinbase partner exchange called GDAX which lets you exchange for the real time price for market and limit orders and low to no fees.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:29:39
Here’s my advice on what I did and I am fairly new to all of this. Don’t buy through wire transfer from kraken, it’s a headache and there are high fees for using a wire transfer. I bought bitcoin on gdax and sent it over to my kraken account from which I bought XRP easily and then stored on my ledger. A bit of a process but well worth it! Good luck!
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:30:14
I propose bitcoin is officially a joke
@_date: 2018-03-12 00:24:43
It was my neighbor, can I have my $10 million now?
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:58:41
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:14:51
You better get yourself plenty of ass on that trip or else this was a big mistake ��
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:37:41
Depression, excitement and anxiety all rolled into one ��
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:44:24
Government banned bitcoin commercials after the TD Ameritrade commercial was aired
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:02:29
Probably back to $20k by tomorrow morning ��
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:56:32
Well, you obviously didn’t understand what I said but thanks
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:42:43
Wow I just watched 18-22 and now I know exactly what to do! Thanks a lot 
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:11:34
Is there a way to set a stop order for no fee?
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:43:00
Do you know what it means when it says “ may incur slippage” and is that normal?
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:52:57
Well duh, at this point that’s all we can really do
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:12:39
For the most part that’s what I’ve been doing, but I’m also curious about trading sometimes. Seems fun.
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:45:23
That’s what trump calls fake news
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:07:52
Ok I think I understand what I meant to say now lol. I bought bitcoin at $4600 and I want to set a stop loss order for $5400 in case it goes any lower. Make sense now?
@_date: 2018-04-27 23:13:43
Couple mil here and there usually 
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:59:12
Haha right! My broker has a multimillion dollar condo on Sunny Isles Beach for sale and he says the seller will accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:44:03
I am a real estate agent in the Fort Lauderdale/Miami area. There have been more and more sellers willing to accept bitcoin. My broker has a listing in Sunny Isles Beach for $4M willing to accept bitcoin as well. Also, I posted an article here about a week ago from Florida Realtors Mag educating us how to deal with transactions with Crypto.
