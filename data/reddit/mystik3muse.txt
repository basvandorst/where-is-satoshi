Those entities that have the most to lose and/or their Business Model (Banks, Brokerages, Insurance Industry etc) threatened or displaced are the BIGGEST critics of Bitcoin BTC and the Financial Media is on their side thus the lies and FUD.

Lucky you.... The way Citi managed my mortgage escrow account was criminal.  
Will never do business with Citi, Wells Fargo or TD ever.

Was expecting that to happen... Banks make more money off of their credit card operations through penalties and fees than anything else

My thinking is any buy below 7/8 K is cheap. Best to take coin off the Exchange and store in a Hard Wallet like trezor.
If an Exchange does not support a Hard Fork and you store your coin there then you may not get the free coin that comes with a contentious fork.
Remember: If you do not control your private key then you really don't own Bitcoin. A Hard Wallet stores both your private and public keys

The question is....
"Whats the Bottom"?
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:07:17
Your premise is a mixture of hyperbole and assumptions.
You haven't the slightest idea of what you are talking about concerning segwit2..
The NYA was authored by Digital Currency Group... A group of bankers who are pushing the contentious hard fork of bitcoin blockchain.
Easy to research and verify.

lot of cons using credit card. When using a credit card with CoinBase - CoinBase will charge an additional fee. Then your credit card charges you a hefty International Processing Fee and no its not treated as a cash advance.
With CoinBase the only pro is you receive your coin immediately.

If you don't buy before Hard Fork then you won't get free coin.
