Lol true
@_date: 2019-09-08 17:46:07
Lol ripple was the first crypto I wanted. Late 2016 I think
@_date: 2019-09-08 01:42:52
I was thinking something like that, thanks
@_date: 2019-09-08 01:45:03
Yeah, personally I never go out much and I dont have any personal expenses so yeah I'll do a lot then. I feel like going out is temporary and a waste of money down the line. Thanks
@_date: 2019-09-08 02:00:01
Yeah that's the reason I want to start investing young. I'm gonna put all my effort into not pulling back and keeping my investments, thanks

Yeah lol. The only thing I really spend money on is video games. But I'd rather invest
@_date: 2019-09-08 02:01:25
I have bought bitcoin before around $100
@_date: 2019-09-08 17:43:23
@_date: 2019-09-08 01:58:01
Through paxful or friends. I think I might ask my parents to use their information so I can get btc with no to little rates, but I doubt they would be open to that, thanks
@_date: 2019-09-08 03:56:21
Yeah he was just in my dms
