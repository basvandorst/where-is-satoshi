Those are not the same argument so both would be valid arguments to make.  Having a large decentralized network doesn't equate to immediate user adoption but it does make it difficult to supersede.  
How would amazon bootstrap said network to the scale of bitcoin without spending incredible amounts of capital?  How could we actually believe that it was decentralized if it is a central entity creating it as opposed to the free market gradually adopting it.

Unforeseen devastating bug in the protocol is about it.  Bitcoin is beyond outside influence at this point so although it is terrible when something like gox goes under, or disappointing when a big gov't bans it, it's not a really a threat to the bitcoin network as a whole.  The technology is groundbreaking, is built for the internet, and will empower  the 3.5 billion unbanked in the world.  It's revolutionary and only an inward collapse will stop it.
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:23:55

Credit cards could theoretically reduce their fees *if* everything works out properly but it is highly unlikely that they will reach the low fee standards that Bitcoin provides.  
While this point of sale feature might slow down or turn away some people who were looking for the mobile payments potential of Bitcoin it is simply a small bump in the road.....and probably a primer to the idea of mobile payments and Bitcoin to many.  As bitterbillsfan said....if you think this is competing with BTC then you don't understand the tech.  
There is no reason why Apple would NOT integrate Bitcoin into Apple Pay in the future. The worry (and it would still be centralized so not a huge worry) would be an Apple coin of sorts.  This is just a payments platform and Bitcoin can be included on it. 
The real battles are....
Apple vs. Paypal vs. any of the tech companies that will create online point of sale payment wallets
and 
Bitcoin vs. Banks &amp; to a lesser extent Bitcoin vs. CC's (to a lesser b/c credit is something Bitcoin doesn't offer.

Great article by a friend of mine pertaining to your exact question.  Enjoy.
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:02:06
For all of naysayers to this idea.....is it a better option than the current Powerball structure?  The answer is 1000 times YES.  
A tweak in the allocation between winner and charity might be needed.  Maybe 80/20 or even 50/50 thus making the charitable donations on par with the gambling aspect of this.  Considering this could and would be a WORLDWIDE funding effort I'd imagine that the prizes have the potential to match current Powerball payouts....if not exceed them in a truly exponential and stratopheric manner.
Gambling will not stop.  Moral policing does not work.  The question is where would we rather see the money go?  To the state, which has proven time and again that it handles funds poorly?  Or to a charitable donation where 25,50,100,500 million dollars (or 25, 50, 100, or 500 BTC...kidding!)?
The answer is obvious.  If you hate lotteries then don't troll on the idea just because the concept of gambling, w/ a next to zero percent chance of winning, turns you off.  People are aware of this but they still DO IT ALL THE TIME.  This idea reallocates the money to a better cause and has a "phenomenon" potential because of its scope and scale.  It spreads the idea of Bitcoin along with showcasing its power.  
This would be cool.  Somebody take a chance.

That would lessen the fees and make it more comparable but it wouldn't outright surpass the low fees of BTC.
While I agree that these are two of the main features for "first" world adoption...this doesn't touch decentralization or access to the blockchain.  And for places outside of this country....it doesn't touch remittances, store of value, hedge against inflation.

Regarding remittances I think the point to stress is that  holding bitcoin is not essential.  If people are wary / skeptical of Bitcoin they can immediately cash out into their currency of choice.  Considering transfers are frictionless &amp; nearly instant there is little risk of volatility if both parties are on the same page of when the funds are being transferred.  This is the market that is most ready to embrace Bitcoin.... and it will genuinely change the lives of some of the poorest people in the world.

Don't invest more than you can lose.  Neither of these are safe investments period.  If you are putting serious money into coins though go Bitcoin, hands down.  Alts are appealing but, in my opinion, unless you are actively trading them (any by actively trading them I mean constant, minute to minute analysis of trade volume &amp; trends) or mining the coins then it's easy to get burned and you will lose money.  New last with new features supplant the hot alt of last week and prices rise and plummet at ridiculous rates.  It's not really buy &amp; hold type stuff.  Bitcoin on the other hand, while nothing is certain, had the overwhelming chance to be either THE coin to make it or at least the "store of value" coin to come through.  Infrastructure is being built around Bitcoin, not the others.  50/50 Bitcoin to Alt investment ratio is way too much.  If you want action in both go 80/20.  Plus it looks like Bitcoin has bottomed out &amp; prob will see a price spike in the fall when ETFs &amp; BIT Investment Trust open their doors.

Your comparison is poor.  Napster was a single point of failure which led to bitorrent or a decentralized solution.  Bitcoin, hence the "bit", is decentralized.  
With will BTC fail or win, nobody knows yet.  But I wouldn't bet against itand quite frankly id own a little as a hedge.  The network is incredibly robust and secure.  It'd take an unprecedented effort to try to create a network as strong and decentralized as BTC and it's hard to see some entity being successful in replacing it.

This is a shocking response.  You are SO right though, keep spreading the good word.

Both.  It doesn't need to be one or the other...in fact it can't be one or the other.  
The incentives of BTC are one of its strongest components and people are incentivized to speculate on bitcoin b/c of what may turn out to be its killer app....scarcity.  Value is added to the network by holders keeping their BTC for the long haul.
Your hypothetical insinuates greed from the BTC community but really its just incentives in action.  
Also, your scenario is incredibly unlikely.

Your broker is being insincere and I'd probably think twice about keeping your funds (or at least all your funds) with them.
To buy initial shares issued by the Bitcoin Investment Trust you would have to be an accredited investor.
To buy GBTC (a secondary market) on platforms like TD Ameritrade you need no such accredidation.
The process for BIT shares is as follows.
1.Accredited Investor buy shares from the Bitcoin Investment Trust
2. Investors hold shares for one year
3. Investors are then allowed to sell shares (to anyone!!!) under the GBTC moniker on secondary markets which is what is happening now.

Dollar cost average.  Take the money that you want to invest (and can afford to lose) and buy it over a 3-6 month period.  Or take half now and just buy to get skin in the game (interesting 3 weeks ahead) and then dollar cost the rest over a set time period.

If you are playing the day to day, week to week, even month to month game, it is extremely difficult to pick either the right time to buy or the right time to sell.
If you believe that bitcoin has a place in this world, then it's scarcity will dictate that the price will go higher.  BTC is binary, it's either going to zero or significantly higher.  
I can't tell you if BTC will have a higher or lower price than $692 tomorrow, next week, or next month, but if this thing still exists in 5 years, the price will be a magnitude higher.
@_date: 2016-11-23 15:52:37
So I agree w/ BTC_Forever in spending ample amounts of time researching bitcoin, but I completely disagree with his advice on getting involved.  The best way to get exposure to the entire BTC industry is by buying and holding bitcoin.  Investing in side bitcoin projects is more risky than actually holding the asset.  
If the company you invest in does exceptionally well, then bitcoin does exceptionally well.  If the company goes under you lose your money and bitcoin says "meh".  Not saying you can't allocate any funds to something like bnktothefuture, but your primary investment should be in the actual asset. 
As always the necessary statement needs to be said....never invest more than you can afford to lose and understand that bitcoin is terribly risky and, ultimately, binary.  In 5-10 years it will either be worthless (or close to it) or significantly higher in price than it is today.  Getting exposure to the asset isn't a bad thing though due to the potential for a massive upside.  If you are buying, I'd dollar (euro) cost average it.  Maybe 25% up front in a single buy and then allocate a percentage of the funds you want to invest in set payments over a period of time (once a week, biweekly, or monthly) to better shield you from the volatility of the asset.
Note I am not a financial advisor by any stretch, these are just my opinions.  Good luck!
@_date: 2016-11-23 16:34:55
Maybe.  I haven't heard of it though.  BTC is exceptionally volatile, which is why I suggest the DCA.  If you got into BTC and bought your stack at $800 in January 2014, then you'd still be underwater in your investment.  If you DCA it over a 6 months to a year, you'd have been better.  Of course the reverse is true too.  In the past year if you dollar cost averaged, your first purchase would be significantly lower than your last.  
I am not saying its the best investment strategy, but its the safest way to spread risk in an unpredictable asset.

In a capital controlled country, the ship has passed.  That Greeks are driving the market is a silly narrative.
What *might* be driving the market is speculation from all of this.
And what Greece has done is that it allows the narrative of BTC to change from drugs &amp; Mt. Gox to a hedge against the overwhelming, impossible to pay debts of many European nations.  Greece can get another bail out, but that doesn't mean they'll be able to pay their bills in a year.  Same goes for France, Italy, Spain, and Portugal.
BTMs are a marketing campaigns within themselves and they are a familiar way of obtaining money.  If we saw an influx of them throughout the countries, with European debt still looming, it could be a big change.  
Remember...it doesn't need to be 50% of the population.  If 5-10% of these populations were introduced to BTC it'd be a big deal.

For such a hater....do you own ANY cryptocurrency? Or do you just constantly frequent BTC forums to troll?

B/c this is r/bitcoin not r/ethereum.  Also, you missed a couple earlier today.

Does Factom have any competitors at this point?  If it is built on the BTC blockchain, want is the incentive to buy factoids over just more BTC?  Is the idea that Factoms' value can grow at a greater factor than BTC ie A BiG Bank uses Factom....this might 2X the price of BTC but 10X factom.  Is this logic at all correct?

They can make money by arbitraging and writing their BTC depreciation as a capital loss.  Can the argument that they won't sell until the spot price of BTC rises to a certain figure be put to bed?!

Stay in BTC for the love of God.  While BTC is the best bet.....if you are going to go w/ another coin go for an app coin like Factom, Storj, or Augur....

What do you think GBTC will do to the liquidity in the market?  Is this a massive step in the right direction, do you think it will have real impact on the market?  Also, how heavily is the Bitlicense weighing on your clients?  Is it a make or break for institutional money to get involved and further use your platform?

Are you really just looking to score $50 bucks here are there.  Buy and HODL!  BTC can be SIGNIFICANTLY higher...whether you bought at 250 or 350 doesn't matter so much when the price is in the thousands.  It is a scarce resource that is backed by one of the great technologies since the internet.  
So the simple answer is yes.  And don't panic if it drops...or rises.

10 to 20 times over and your profit is 1-2 million....which is more than a nice profit.  The percentage returned on your investment, if BTC hit 100,000, is incredible regardless of how much BTC you owned.

They will sell at a premium &amp; buy back on an exchange.  I don't know why so many are struggling with this concept.  Where they bought BTC at means little.

Bitcoin mining is incredibly competitive and expensive.  If you are looking for profitability open up an account at Coinbase, Ciricle, or Xapo, buy bitcoin, and hold.

Altcoiners somehow believe that their coins won't all be replaced by sidechains....which is silly.

Roth IRAs + 401Ks are meant for retirement and as such there are stiff penalties to withdraw funds early from either of these investments.  This is money that people have, usually far exceeding what one has in their banking account, that until now could not get exposure to BTC.
People will pay a premium (of course not an absolutely egregious one) to reallocate some of their funds in these investment vehicles to GBTC.  First time anyone has ever been able to do this.  
As for not wanting to sell at loss.  The holders of these funds can simply arbitrage and buy back BTC at a discount at other exchanges.  As long as they are selling at a premium, even a small one, they will be profitable.
Maybe not as big of a deal as COIN but certainly a massive step in the right direction.  No guarantee that COIN gets approved.  Barry Silbert, BIT, DCG, should all be receiving huge pats on the back.  They have done well for the community with this venture.

Use Circle or Coinbase to buy bitcoin &amp; hold.  Forget mining.  $300 will get you a coin, $300 in mining will get you next to nothing.
@_date: 2015-03-27 15:28:39
No problem!

So this market is accepting Bitcoin or specific vendors are?
@_date: 2015-03-27 14:58:53
Coinbase or Circle.  Localbitcoins charges a premium compared to these other two options.  The advantage that they have is NO ID....if that is important to you.  
If you are a normal person looking to buy BTC... Coinbase &amp; Circle are far and away the best option

Sweet post bro!  While it is ridiculous to even acknowledge your post.....you literally say that $100,000 BTC wouldn't make anybody super rich even if they had 10-20.  Ok, sure.  But what you are implying then is that it's not a good investment to buy coins at $200, $500, $2,000 even if they appreciated to $100,000.  While much of your post is nonsense, this is an incredibly dumb statement to make.

Storj &amp; Maidsafe are appcoins...a bit different from Bitcoin imo...  LTC, Doge etc are BTC's competitors.  I think appcoins coexist and while the other options don't die, they'll increasingly lose share &amp; relevance to Bitcoin.
