The chain would be considered compromised and its value would plummet ie btg

No, you could hard fork. But the idea is the new chain would just be attacked again as it would be even easier now on a new fork to 51% attack. These attacks aren't practical for double spending as much as it is for destroying the reputation of a chain

Mt gox just moved a shit ton of coins. The market is shitting its pants in response. The funny thing is, they moved coins a few days ago causing the last flash crash. But they never sold any coins, just movement. Definitely strange but I'm still bullish on the market. Mt gox doesn't have true authority to sell the coins without pissing off the board of trustees and violating their agreement. If they were going insolvent on their agreement we would probably see way more coins going for sale in a one shot deal, rather than the "small" amount that is being moved currently. My conspiracy theory is someone with the wallet access is making a shitton off of shorting bitcoin and being able to control the market just by moving the coins. The trustees dont get mad because their agreement isn't violated, and someone at mt gox is still happy because they can make bank. Just my 2 cents

Lol I love bitcoin as much as the next guy here but wtf  bitcoin is not the best blockchain currency for this. Better off being an erc20 token imo and brave has one of the most impressive dev teams in the crypto space rn. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 05:51:10
I'd be interested to hear why you think bitcoin holds better use case here.

Its minuscule to the environmental impact of fiat. Armored trucks to move small amounts of money. Armored semis with backup whenever the fed or banks move money. Then theres gold. No one cares  about the environmental impact of drilling, mining, melting gold then the armor transport just to lock it in a vault underground.
