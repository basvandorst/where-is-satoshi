What banking fees? All our transfers are free or cheaper than bitcoin and instantaneous. I actually get 4-6 percent interest just for keeping my money in a checking account.
Do you guys just say all of this to fuel the hype machine?

Haha. :) External Indian debt is low. Dependance on external trade is low. Indian banks are all implicitly guaranteed by the sovereign and are very regulated. 
Regulatory standings and capital requirements are more stringent than many western nations. 
I earn in dollars but honestly I would feel more secure with my money in India than outside. 
Like they say, the world may collapse. But India cannot go any lower. :D

Of course we are not talking about the same India. And whatever you have heard is a load of bollocks. Could you point me to a source which says this?
If you do a term deposit for 4 years you would get 550 USD at the end of 4 years.
If not you would get 470 USD at 4 percent.
Intra bank transfer in India is free in most cases or 20 cents flat fee. It is also instantaneous now.
People get 5 ATM transactions a month free. Debit cards are free. Cheque book is free. It was a huge culture shock for me when I moved to a country where I had to pay for these. 
The government recently unveiled a Unified Payment Interface, which is a set of APIs on which people can build applications for payment processing. The idea is to promote frictionless payments.

Neighbouring country is experiencing instability. 50 today, 500 next week, 5 billion the next month.
