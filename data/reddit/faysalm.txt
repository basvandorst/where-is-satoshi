This is why the bounty. Someone somewhere knows something. A bounty can help shed some light.

any bank would gladly lend you money at the rates we are seeing at finnex on lending. Hell they would lend you money for a fraction of those rates .... what I want to know is who are those banks.

If the money is sitting in the accounts even at the lowest of interest rates they get back on the money each USDT is greater than $1.

based on bitthumb and finnex volumes thats 10% of daily volume. Add in polo and other exchanges dealing with USDT then we will see around 20% or more.

See now as the bounty grows there will definitely be people who will start looking. All we ask is for transperency .... i dont even mind if they are borrowing from banks as long as the tether has 1:1 reserve.

I am not giving out bounties for using common sense. Its christmas, but I am not santa claus.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:21:08
The idea is others add to the bounty ... i know its small. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:09:23
No - i think if the banks are lending money and they are happy with this practice ... there really is no downside to this .... its bullish. Even tho its unethical and probably illegal in some countries .... but that doesnt matter. What I am more worried about is knowing the money is there and the banks cant "margin call" finnex / tether.

bounty must be too low.

I am trying to be neutral here -- if there are indeed banks lending money to finnex, the whole market will explode up because other banks will do the same. There is nothing wrong with investing in crypto - thats what banks do. Most banks have policies against it, clearly the ones finnex uses dont. Knowing there are actual banks or investors and who they are puts every at ease because whoever lends money can easily decide to cash out.

If someone offered to hack tether, and tether got hacked, would you not want that to happen now instead of 100$ billion later?

p.s. What is asked for is acknowledging LTC as BTC Jr. as a value added addition and push code in wherever whenever. There is some work being done, but it would be great to see everything core has worked on released in LTC and when happy, adopted in BTC. Both coins will grow together, and basically everything else (I am looking at you ripple and eth) will be dead.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:22:48
Absolutely. Well put. BTC + LTC
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:54:42
True. But when big money and billionaires start buying and openly shilling ... its a done deal.
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:32:10
As we see it today. That  spot BTC enjoyed - is on the way out.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:11:42
Yeah ... that may have been a bit dramatic.
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:23:41
Bitmain only stuck to the agreement because of threat of uasf and pow change. They did not lee their "word"
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:52:04
Thats the point I am trying to make ... its not quite an alt. More like a cousin or brother from another mother.
