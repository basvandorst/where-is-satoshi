@_date: 2015-06-01 12:57:16
Avg. transaction value is the almost the same.
@_date: 2015-12-27 11:11:03
Franco coin lol, a guy made a coin and named it after himself. Currently ranked 232 on coinmarketcap, that sticker costs more than the coin. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:00:10


Litecoin is practically on every exchange bitcoin is on , it's  the number 1 trading pair.

@_date: 2015-06-01 13:31:12
@_date: 2015-12-18 08:23:30
Send litecoin to a exchange and then send bitcoin to the same exchange and you'll see the difference.
@_date: 2015-12-25 08:55:25
Don't listen to a guy named "man gizz" lol
Everyone knows Litecoin will rise when Bitcoin pumps.

$ 120,034  vs $ 2,428,500  of trade volume in the last 24 hours , marketcap and 24 hour volume mean a lot.

@_date: 2014-07-28 23:31:59
Dogecoin is at risk of getting 51%ed , it's hash rate is dangerously low compared to litecoin , you did good selling. 
You may want to diversify some into litecoin.

Technically bitcoin/litecoin are commodities that are also digital currency. So yes they are investments.

Litecoin always goes down when bitcoin rises then slingshots.
@_date: 2015-02-02 00:18:22
Adding so many scam coins didn't help increase volume.
@_date: 2015-02-11 10:25:06
I didn't organize any raid , I did however post this link in saying how bitcoiners are calling Litecoin , an altcoin with the highest volume a scam. It's obvious what people think , as all scamcoin accusations  are getting downvoted to hell.
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:01:26
Litecoin is one of the only altcoins which is not a scam , it was released in a fair way and has no premine. is spreading fud
@_date: 2015-02-11 01:58:07


How the fuck would you know this , unless you work at Coinbase ,you have no idea what goes on in the offices. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 04:25:59
* They had a shit amount of crapcoins
* They even listed AUR the mother of all premines scams
* Listing all those shit coins ruined their reputation 
* The only alt coins with volume were litecoin and dogecoin 
* A mod for used to work there , so it's likely that most of the dogecoin volume was the employee trading back and forth with no fees.
All those reasons I listed and the crash of bitcoin led to it's failure.
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:07:41
Correct btcchina was leading the way in volume and price at that time.
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:06:08


1,857,420	in 24 hour volume , go find me another coin that has that. Litecoin is the most successful Altcoin , money doesn't lie
@_date: 2015-02-11 12:43:03


No Litecoiner believes this , we believe in the future bitcoin will be used to buy big ticket items like cars and houses while litecoin will be used to buy less expensive items like laptops and tvs.
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:14:11
They are probably getting swamped with orders.
@_date: 2015-02-02 04:38:22
I understand It's easy to get frustrated in the crypto world , you need to follow situations very closely to see what really happen.I'm not happy they closed , they were a good exchange except I would of  done things differently.Having a picture of a dog with a party hat smoking a cigar on the main page turned people off completely and made crypto look like a joke. No offense to dogecoiners but some people didn't get the joke.
@_date: 2015-02-11 12:50:40
besides bitcoin obviously  
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:19:24
that's not a threat at all...
@_date: 2015-02-02 04:06:01
Listing all those scamcoins turned people off completely from using that exchange even for bitcoin trading.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:08:57
