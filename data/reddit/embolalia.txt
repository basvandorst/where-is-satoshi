Cool, but I think it's a bit more involved than OP is looking for (requiring the receiver to own and operate a server). I think something more like the first thing that comes to my mind, slapping a TXT record onto your domain's DNS records (or those of a domain you can get access to do this on)  so that `btc.embolalia.com` resolves to `1JzbtCu1UHNQmF6LAjSj2hUepR2LupuXvb`, was more the intended goal.

I was about to say that the difference would be the ability to not participate, but then we have that now. I can shove USD notes or (insert commodity here) under my mattress or in a safe deposit box just as easily and with the same risk as bitcoin.
However, I wouldn't say the Bitcoin future you foresee (and I actually agree) is completely on par with the current status quo. For those putting their money in a third party it is. But for those who choose not to, the big difference is that holding your own would not impede your ability to participate in commerce at all. Having stacks of cash with no credit cards or bank account means you basically can't buy things online, get direct deposit for your paycheck, or any number of other things. With BTC, there is effectively no difference in your ability to use your money if you hold it yourself. (Not to mention that BTC will still be essentially fee-free for everyone to make transactions with, unlike credit cards and wire transfers today.)
So, savior of the world bringing in a new era of prosperity and unicorns shitting rainbows? Probably not. But a net benefit to the world, even if most people don't use all of its features? I'd still say so.

I'm thinking three possibilities (not having seen the site personally):
1. They use some heuristic to locate you, like the location of the IP(s) you connect from.
2. They don't. They hold all coins until you get level 1 certified, whether you're Canadian or not, and the message is just poorly worded.
3. They don't. They make a big noise about saying they won't send you your bitcoin to cover their asses in case the authorities come knocking.

Versions aren't decimal numbers, they're a group of numbers separated by a period. 0.10 isn't zero-point-one, it's zero-point-ten. This is a bit clearer when you look at the whole version number, which is currently 0.9.0. Projects can obviously pick what the numbers mean for themselves, but it's best to follow [semantic versioning]( Basically, the first number is the "major version", increased when there are new features that might break things. The middle number is the "minor version", increased when there are new features that don't break anything. The last number is the "patch", which is increased only for minor things that don't change the way you expect the program to work as a user (mostly bug fixes).
TL;DR: The period is a delimiter, not a radix point.

What you're seeing here isn't really a Bitcoin thing, it's a browser thing. [URI schemes]( allow applications to register themselves to handle different types of URIs. They're ancient, and work for all kinds of things like email (I would give an example of it, but reddit's Markdown parser doesn't like ones without the //), [IRC](irc://freenode.net/ and pretty much whatever else you can think of. More recent is the ability for web pages to [use a standard API]( to add URI scheme handlers.

Having two (or more) spaces after a period is an old typographic rule. It comes from monospace font, as on typewriters, where it would help break up the text and keep it from "running". Since most people use variable-width font now, it's not as common as it once was. The [whitepaper]( uses three spaces. I'm guessing is referencing that both authors use the now excessive spacing in their writing (and the fact that that similarity is hardly conclusive since it is still a fairly common typographic rule).

This is more like paying for a better connection from your ISP. It's not prioritizing certain types of traffic, just letting people who pay get more of it. Net neutrality is about keeping ISPs from saying "video traffic gets these speeds, game traffic gets these speeds, web traffic gets these speeds, etc." or the extortionate "give us money, Netflix, or we'll deliberately throttle just your traffic".
In the proposed system, if you pay more, you get more bandwidth, and that's it. It's a subtle, but important, difference.

Define "in general". The cross-country, multi-day trips are more expensive. But in the NEC, and the few other routes that are actually for transit (not just "ooooh, I'm on a train, isn't this fancy!"), the prices are much more competitive. And those routes make up the majority (Northeast Regional and Acela alone make up ~50%) of Amtrak's passengers.
Same goes for the heavy subsidies. (Which, compared to air and road travel, aren't all that heavy. And if you want really ridiculous subsidies, look at inland waterways.) The NEC actually turns a profit, but it all ends up going to the useless lines before they can actually try to use it for anything.

Indeed they were. And insured deposits were not affected. The insurance only covered the first €100,000, and the government did not touch the first €100,000 in any account. The amount they took was based on the uninsured amount, that is the amount over €100,000, in each account.

I don't think it was entering bubble territory so much as it was just simply in a bubble. I think the bubble popped (though, since charting is still a bit off at the moment I can't really say), and the only reason it didn't drop back to the pre-bubble levels of $50 or $60 is because the FinCEN ruling and Euro crisis, beyond just starting the bubble, added "real" value to BitCoin. That said, there's still every chance it's still bubbling and will pop again at any time.

This is one of the things that bothers me, and worries me, about some of the BitCoin community. There seems to be an assumption by many people that "the current banking system is flawed, this is part of the current banking system, therefore it is flawed." The predicate is certainly true, but the rest simply doesn't follow. I really do want to know what the reason is why someone would not want deposit insurance. It seems like a win for the bank, a win for the customer, a win for the society in general, and a win for the currency the bank, customer, and society use. Sure, the FDIC isn't perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the alternative.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:04:10
It is unrelated to bank bailouts. FDIC doesn't kick in until the bank has already failed. Bailouts stop the bank from failing. I don't disagree that bailouts create the wrong incentives, but the FDIC is not a bailout. The FDIC is what makes sure that *you* get your money back when the bank has been irresponsible. The FDIC doesn't create an incentive for risk, because the bank gains nothing from it. In fact, the FDIC makes *requirements* which the bank must meet regarding how much risk it can have. It *dis*incentivizes risk.

By [bits]( It's already a unit, and incidentally also a vernacular term for "some small amount". With "Dollar", it's differentiated by either very clear context (there are few situations in which a person saying Dollar in Canada would mean an Australian Dollar) or, when the context isn't clear, using the name of the country as you just did. Bitcoin, as an electronic method of payment, sits right on top of both the unit bit and the vernacular term bit, meaning that there would *never* be a very clear context for it to be referred to by simply "bit".
"Coin", on the other hand, would be relatively unambiguous. Coin isn't another unit and, when used as a count noun anyway, isn't a term for a nonspecific quantity. You would still have ambiguity with physical coins, but the times in which bitcoins and physical coins would be in consideration at the same time would be far fewer.

I highly doubt any company that sells payment processing will jump on the bandwagon. It's hard to justify encouragin a new technology that renders one of your major operations (and, probably, a profitable one) obsolete. That knocks out eBay, Google, Amazon, and *certainly* Western Union. I'm not saying this is the right decision for them in the long term (any of these companies has more to gain by being the first pre-established name in the game than they do by being yet another player in credit cards), just that it's unlikely that any of them will be able to see that it isn't.

If you're looking to hold short term, you're going to need to learn to make that guess yourself. If you're looking to hold long-term, the old adage applies: "The best time to plant a tree is ten years ago. The second best time is now."
In the short term, we have no idea what will happen. It could drop to 400 today, or it could jump to 900 today. Or further, in either direction. But in the long term, the consensus you'll find here is that it will get higher. It may never do another week-long 500% runup, but I, and I think most people here, see the price in a year as at least a bit higher than it is now. This means, if you are willing and can afford to stay in that long, there's no time like the present. If you're holding long-term, tomorrow's price doesn't matter, even if it is lower. Next year's price matters.

There's no insurance against the value dropping. Not at all. It is *structured* against hyper-inflation due to creation of excess money, but it's not *insured* against that. There's a difference between *in*surance and *as*surance. Regardless, it certainly isn't insured or assured against a drop in value. Nor are fiat currencies, of course. Deposit insurance has *nothing* to do with the structure of a currency. It is an insurance policy against a particular calamity, which could befall a hypothetical BitCoin-based bank just as easily as a fiat currency-based bank.

It's important to understand, though, that building a massive, resilient, scalable system and, more importantly, testing it with all the edge cases and possible problems to the point where you can be comfortable handing the majority of a billion-dollar trading industry isn't something you can do in 12 hours. It's not something you can do in 12 *weeks*. The entire reason that gox has these problems to begin with is because their system was not prepared for it. Settle down, let the engineers do their job.

Bitinstant, all told, ends up with a markup of just over 4%. It's a pain to do, but it's faster than a bank transfer and a hell of a lot cheaper than the site you reference. Seriously? $91? Right now?

FDIC does not receive money from the government. Period. You want to talk about the problems of fiat currency in general, fine. Go do that. But the FDIC does not receive money from the Fed, or Congress, or taxpayers, or *anybody* except for the *consumer banks* to which they provide insurance. Period full stop end of story.

Even though centibyte and millibyte don't make sense, using the same letter to denote byte and bitcoin in SI abbreviations would get confusing. Use BTC, or the ฿ sign to avoid confusion. Personally, I also prefer millicoin and microcoin as the pronunciation, as suggested by another commenter above.

To number 3, it's important to understand the difference between copyright and patent. A copyright covers basically any substantial expression of an idea: books, movies, code, etc. A patent covers an invention: tools, machines, and processes. Software patents are a bit of a gray area. A software patent covers an invention implemented by a computer, so it covers the algorithm and process more than the code. All software is copyrighted, but not all software inventions are patented. Some examples of software patents would be media codecs like GIF (now expired) and MP3, and the aforementioned elliptic curve cryptography.
A number of projects arguably *do* infringe on software patents. Most notable is probably FFmpeg, which implements a number of patented media codecs.
The reason more don't do it is quite simply that it's illegal. That illegality has a number of implications for a project. Patent holders in general love to talk a big game about how they'll sue anyone who had anything to do with anything remotely related to something that might be considered somewhat related to their patent. (Usually, the more ridiculous the patent, the bigger the talk.) Even if it's all posturing, nobody with anything to lose wants to get involved in a lawsuit, even a frivolous one. So if you want your software to be used (and, when it comes to open source, that's basically the entire purpose of writing it), it's best to toe the line on patents. Some projects get away with it, because what they do is so important to people that they're willing to risk it (like FFMpeg) or because the patent holder has made a promise (which more often than not they reserve the ability to revoke) that they won't enforce that patent (like Mono, which Microsoft has promised not to sue over C patents for the time being).

Fuck 2011, if *March* could see us now. I first bought in at the end of last March for $72. I spent most of that, of course. But the whole reason I bought in at all was to spend it (and get a discount), so I don't regret it one bit.

It worries me that so many people seemed to think just that. There were people saying $400. Then again, I was saying it wouldn't make $100 for quite a while more, and even after the crash it's still above that. I think I was "less wrong" though.

Well, no. A beer isn't currency, but you can go to the bar and buy one for a price, so it's not priceless. The internet doesn't have a price, though, so you're right. It is actually priceless.

The best way, if you always want the latest on Ubuntu or its derivatives (like Mint, which is what I prefer), is not to compile but to use the official repository:
    sudo apt-add-repository 
    sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install bitcoin
If you do want to compile it, though, pretty much every project uses the same three commands, executed inside the source directory:
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

I think you completely missed the point of my post. I was just wondering aloud how a scheme like OP suggested (that is, a business which properly manages bitcoin for other businesses) might work. I was saying that specific business model, of giving businesses the end-of-month cash out they want while spreading the sell out, was risky, and it is. You seem to have gotten the idea that I was also calling for some sort of protection for that risk, which isn't even remotely true.

Is there a site which provides a weighted average across the top N exchanges? From what I've seen, Gox is what a number of places use to get their conversion. A cross-site average would probably be a better idea. I imagine this would be easy to write, so I might do so if nobody else has done so.

If you have something you want that takes BitCoin as payment, (like maybe [virtual hosting]( )go ahead and use it. It's meant as currency, so spend it like currency. Otherwise, stick it under your mattress and forget about it. When the next opportunity to buy something with it comes up, pull it out and be pleasantly surprised by the increase in value.

For untargeted (going to the whole site). If you want to target to users of a particular sub (something I'm considering myself), it starts at $30 per day.
Also, do they take bitcoin for ads? It looks like they only take credit cards, which is unfortunate.

Again, you're confusing patent with copyright. Software copyright is violated *just* as often as movie and music copyright. People pirate Windows and Photoshop and various games quite frequently. That has nothing to do with patents, which is what I was talking about (and what I thought you were talking about).
I wonder if maybe your question wasn't clear, and I'm not answering what you actually want to know.

Meh, I don't care about a few months. I care about the next time my VPS bill comes due, which is a bit under a year from now. As long as they're still taking bitcoin (and giving a 5% discount for using it) and the price is over my weighted average purchase price, it can do whatever the fuck it wants in the interim.

You're missing my point. With bitinstant, you go to the local CVS or Walmart or whatever, pay there, and by the time you get back there's money in your MtGox account. No banks involved. I did it all in the span of an hour yesterday, 30 minutes of which was walking to CVS and back.

Maybe best known (though I'd like to see a source for that claim), but at 2BTC they aren't the largest by BTC revenue. Hell, I've paid ChunkHost more than that just by myself.

And how much Namecheap has taken in return for hostnames and other services. And [they aren't the only ones](

This is the big bullet point. Decentralization, anonymity, lack of regulation, and value as an investment are *not* what businesses want to hear. The first two are irrelevant, the third brings up the possibility of liability if it *becomes* regulated, and the latter makes the business consider the possibility that it will *de*value before they can cash out.
What businesses want to hear is how a proposal can increase revenue, reduce cost, or improve service. BTC's big selling point is in reducing cost. If you want to sell BTC to business, sell it on that.
