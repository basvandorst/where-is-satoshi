I can't believe you allow users to use this service if you feel their password should be exceptionally long and complex.  It is irresponsible to offer a financial service and have major vulnerabilities.  Especially as you mention anyone with a common length password 6-8 is NOT secure.

1) The point of the difficulty is to keep it balanced, and I think a bigger block size would only take longer.
2) I completely agree, however, you will find: private, invite only, or members only mining pools that could actually have MORE control and even take more of the Bitcoin for themselves.
3) That will never work because global currencies are involved.  The exchange is forced to be regulated based simply on laws...
4) Work on them how?
5) Dont listen to this guy: uoxKSdbhp7op

Just about every server (or IP, better yet) gets a hack attempt every day.  Random attempts and when a hacker gets a hit that one of the vulnerabilities he is testing worked, he/she can go in and do as they wish. Once it is discovered what the server is for, it can easily be taken advantage of accordingly.
My personal experience has shown that without initial server hardening (to a great degree) you leave any server very open.  Also, it is incredibly common for root password bruteforces.

If the start up capital, whether it be in USD or BTC, I would have loved to start an exchange very early on.  However, I don't feel I have enough resources to truly start what a Btc exchange needs to be.
Bitcoins are not overly hard to get, I have had many customers easily get them with their credit card or simple bank transfer.

Hardly a serious prize at stake here.  A hacker could wait a short while for some serious business to develop, and use any exploit to get what they want.  Even the $500 top prize is speculated at a difficultly level.
Also, a simple server hack is much more likely than web-code exploits.

I dont know why you feel the need to "prove" this cooldown, it is all over their website, and they state clear and reasonable arguments for the website to be on "cooldown" or while they are upgrading.

I would hope you are speaking for everyone as well.  Not EVERY bitcoin user has a reddit account and not all of them that do read every post.  So I'm sure there are many people w/ bad passwords (even a 12+ character password can be bad) and do not take any safety precautions.

You are getting a lot of bad cred for being so mad 
 if you lawyer is telling you not to speak, it is for a very specific reason.  He is more likely to be further away from helping/resolving any of the situation if he cannot follow simple instruction.
 his situation is probably extensively complex and require a lot of work to resolve.

1) For them not to expect over double their traffic is more than reasonable BY ALL MEANS.
2) Most people panic'd and did exactly as expected.
3) Wrong.
4) You can manipulate, but I've seen PayPal (with my own eyes) defaced and hacked.  More people than ever before use PayPal who can freely take your money from your Paypal or even your bank account (particularly chase customers as they work so closely w/ each other).  Paypal is still trusted to hold our money, yet when you take it out, they will do what they can to keep it.  I like Bitcoin because no1 touches my money except for ME.  A little additional due diligence could do a lot for Btc on the side of exchanges.  Including utilizing services such as CloudFlare or having plans in place to prep for the introduction of bitcoin becoming world renowned.  
5) It will remain, people are all about making a quick dollar, bitcoin gave that and will again and again and again.

I don't think your small number of transactions are hardly noticed by more than a computer let alone an actual person.  However, when odd activity like massive movements of funds, transfers of in -&gt; out 100% of the account looks very odd.  
Also, I would like to note, I have dealt with this situation, selling digital items through Paypal and my own bank, Chase.
Paypal received a few credit card disputes from fraudulent transactions in a row (after many thousand successful) within a couple days, and immediately locked my account.  The person who handled the account action actual thought I was selling fraudulent goods (despite, yet again, hundreds of more than satisfied customers) and chose to close my account completely.  Not only did this hault my business, but it also meant that thousands of dollars in orders were now in limbo.  These funds were eventually reversed/refunded and two of my most recent withdrawls from the account (~$3400, not unusual, amounts of 8000+ sometimes) were "requested" back from Chase by Paypal, and chase granted.  Because of the fraud claims, Paypal also "requested" that my Chase account (both business and personal) be locked.  I received no direct notification (email, call, letter, etc) about this action until I discovered my debit not working while trying to make a transaction (very embarrassing).  Due to the lack of evidence on Paypal's end, and the overwhelming evidence I was able to provide, and an extremely long process, I got the funds placed back into my account (literally taken right back from Paypal) and my account placed back on a normal status.  Also, I am essentially banned from Paypal.
The banker who handled my case, quite well I might add, actually gave me an inside tip of how closely Paypal and Chase work together.  It kind of made me feel uneasy knowing that a 3rd party company had that much control or "say" in what happened to my bank accounts.
**TL;DR - PayPal Steals! Don't Trust Banks!**

We are not the victim of anything.  BitCoin community dealt its hand when anything went right or left they ran that direction.

It has already been stated there are most likely still several weeks left before shipping.  In addition, the way the Josh guy talks on the forum is concerning that he isn't any form of intellectual.  Also, these guys only assemble this horseshit, you can buy your own equipment to make these.  They repeatedly mention that the only thing they do is put it together and slap their sticker on it.  Oh ya, they package your cord and other materials too!

Bitcoin is very open about what it has to offer, and, does not ever involve dollars, etc.  In addition, my wallet doesn't contain any of my personal information either, so the applicability of your comment is slim to none.

A good group of people probably just got really lucky.  And they may have just simply been looking for a very very quick buy of all of their coins without having to adjust the price or put in a new order.

If you actually pay close attention to what he said, "In the UK, you only need to have ONE fraudster target your bank account ONCE and the banks will freeze your account instantly, no questions asked."
You are not at risk if you are not committing fraudulent activity.  You are only doing "consumer" based activities.  When a large exchange owner, who doesnt know how to run a business, uses his own account to handle transfers like this, he is bound to get shit on.
In all reality, many of these people will be lucky to get anything back.  The post provides good detail, but not necessarily the hard truth.

Why would I not sell Bitcoins, I got for $30, at the price of $200+? even w/ the market crashing back down.  Money is involved, money is more important to most people than their own lives (simply because money in our society is often the defining factor in various situations).  The people who lost or failed or think that the market is "done for" are the ones who want more control to occur.
Bitcoin had many more people hurting it yesterday than helping it, and now we are at  $123 USD at this very moment.  There is still stacks of these "0.02" trades, and will most likely negatively affect the market further.
