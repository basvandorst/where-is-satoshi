4250 ATH on Bitstamp!

Just remember that nobody knows what will happen. Historically though it's true that the hype around a price surge only boosts it more, leading to the sell off and bubble pop soon after. However, nobody knows where this peak will end at. Suddenly we have an all time high of $10,000 in a few weeks with a crash back to $5,000. What I mean to say is that this might be the lowest it will be ever again.
This not to say the other guy isn't right, and I would personally not buy on a huge upswing and rather wait out for the fall in price shortly after.

Will it be possible in the future to have this work without an internet connection? Just as cards rely on the terminals.
In that case it would be great when traveling abroad, when you don't want to use your mobile data. Can't wait to try this!

That's no different than being some guy that sold 1000 BTC for 10 $. Exchange to fiat just intruduces more fees.

If you knew anything about cryptos, you'd know that's not true. What are you even suggesting by saying "cryptocurrency is just a name behind the same shit system that we have now"?
It's not the same system as we have now with fiat currencies and never will be. Bitcoin and cryptos aren't controlled by big corporations or governments, but they wont suddenly change who has money and who doesn't. It's not a separate world of value where big bad business can't join.
**However, cryptos and blockchain will likely change the world a whole lot from how we know it.** One business in particular, namely banks, will have to adapt. Just think about how you can transfer money to people in other countries. Current systems force you to send through a bank, that has deals with other banks and so on, all the way to you recipient's bank. All of those banks get paid. Bitcoin is just adress to adress no matter where in the world. You also don't need a bank to safely store you money anymore.
Sure, a lot of businesses will join the world of cryptos and will make a profit, some already established and a lot of new start ups. The point im trying to make is that cryptos is not anti capitalism or whatever you're talking about, but it will make our society more efficient and force a lot of corporations to change or die.
If you think our current system is shit (I agree) and care about it, then I suggest you read up on Ethereum. It's the second biggest crypto and it's unlike bitcoin not just a different kind of money. The imagined implications of its use are huge (imagined because it's fairly new, and like the internet when it first came, we don't really know what it can be used for yet, although it does have a lot of uses already). Sorry if I seem condescending, but it's way too easy to write critical comments and have people agree, even when it's not true.

Often simplified explanations do more harm than good, and this is one that is sufficiently advanced yet relatively accessible.

I'm talking about supply and demand here... There will always be a supply of bitcoins even though no more can be mined. In comparison, when they run out of tulips *they can't magically get more without waiting*, meaning it's a limited supply in that time frame.
There's no point in thinking of mining new coins as the supply of coins. You can't compare it with making tulips, as they are a different kind of product / service. There is theoretically enough supply of coins for the whole universe, not **whole** coins of course, but that's not what it's about either.

That's not what is says. Why do you draw that conclusion?
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:53:34
Nobody us saying anything about bitcoins performance, this is just to illustrate a typical bubble, one we are (probably) witnessing burst right now.
It's just a pattern and it has happened many times in bitcoin already. They happen over and over again - [just have look]( It doesn't mean it won't go higher in the future.

Bits is nice, but I wish it was something that was unique to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:41:25
Yes you are entirely right, but I never said you create more bitcoin by dividing and that was never my point. What I'm saying is that *the value* of bitcoin increases and with it it's market cap, so you don't need more coins to accommodate more people.

Anyone know why they would design the malware with a hard-coded kill switch?
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:00:40
You're right, people don't talk about bits as in binary data, we use bytes. Bits is short and sexy, definitely the best alternative I've seen so far.

Is running a node the same as mining? Or is it simply running the Bitcoin Core client?

He did make death threats and paid "hitmen" although they scammed him.

Isn't it really opposite?
Think about it. A bitcoin can be split as much as you like, but when they run out of tulips you can't split one. There simply aren't more until they grow some. So for short periods of high demand bitcoin can always supply, while tulips can't.
