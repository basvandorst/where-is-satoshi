Why would you publicize this?

Regardless of what Bitcoin does, you're making a mistake.

Comparing to just using USD.  I don't buy, sell or own Crypto.  If I  could buy bitcoin cost free (or close to it) and it was as easy and safe  as moving my money to an FDIC insured bank, and it earned similar  interest; I'd consider moving some money to Bitcoin,

If the US economy collapses, Bitcoin won't save you.  If you expect a collapse, better to stock up on food, water and guns.

Was hoping for something more specific.

FDIC insurance doesn't just cover nationwide catastrophe.  It also covers an individual bank going under or skipping town.  If Chase goes bankrupt, your money is safe.  If BlockFi goes bankrupt or skips town, you're out of luck.
 If the US dollar becomes worthless, the global economy will be in major trouble.  Bitcoin ain't gonna save you.  
Although governments push for continued small inflation, there is no guarantee of that happening ...see Japan's recent history.  By the way, a currency constantly increasing in value is a bad thing for the economy as it discourages spending and growth.  See Japan's recent history.
And there's a reason most governments have moved away from the gold standard.  There are economic benefits to governments having some control over currency.

That's cool.  Didn't know about them.  Steps in the right direction.  Now they just need to get the equivalent of FDIC insurance.

I don’t think bitcoin would save you then either.

Nope. I don't think the US economy will collapse.  Not stocking up on food or water.  Don't have a gun.

Sorry it's not easy enough or cheap enough for the average non-techy to  buy $60 worth of bitcoin and then take it out again.  And learning  about and keeping your bitcoin safe takes extra time and effort and  possibly cost.
For example, Coinbase is frequently recommended to newbs.  But to move $60 in and out it would cost about 10% ($2.99 each way).  Then it looks like there's another 3%+ (round trip) in conversion fees on top of that.

Safer?   My bank account is FDIC insured.  My credit cards take responsibility for any false charges and will also help me fight retailer that try to take advantage of things.  Banks give me interest and credit cards rewards.  Stolen crypto is major source of funding for North Korea.  And who gets paid in Bitcoin?

If the financial system collapses, Bitcoin isn't gonna save you.  I'd rather have monopoly money.  At least you can play a fun game with that.
@_date: 2019-11-14 20:04:38
Good luck with that
@_date: 2019-11-12 23:42:43
What makes you think it's safe?
