Ah, yes, the international student who trades crypto.

They both refused to get involved once she found out they have to do taxes on gains from Bitcoin.

Haven't put any in cold storage... yet. Just want to make sure I have a secure way to make the private key, via a computer with no internet access.

I've done the research. I read all about them. But my dad said they're not trustworthy news reports, and that anybody could be saying that to manipulate the market.

It's literally a question my mom asked. I told her "then I'd have no money and would lose that, and wouldn't sell. I would hold onto it." And she got mad at me.

For sure! Let us know if there’s somewhere we can buy these!

Exactly. What if I just put in a few dollars a month, and then used that to purchase things? IE, buy an Amazon gift card using BTC, and then use the gift card to buy stuff. That wouldn't be gains now, would it?

Thank you so much about clarifying Google. Hate how people automatically assume that other's don't Google first.
1. I literally said the exact thing to her and she followed up with question 2.
2. Exactly. You lose what you put in. Apparently that's confusing for her. Of course I'm not going to put in $120,000, but a small amount to where it won't kill me if I lose it.
3. From what I've read, that's pretty much the same.
4. That's what I was expecting. Sites like localbitcoin might be my go-to to avoid that.
5. That's what I'm saying to them. It's frustrating.
Thank you so much, you helped me out a great deal. Also, just noticed I said 6 and not 5 lol.

But can you pay people on the streets to see their tits?

I have no reason to; thankfully not living that life. Had a friend who used the Silk Road last year and had no idea BTC’s up a lot since then, and he hated himself for it. I plan to HODL for at least 6 months, just to see.
