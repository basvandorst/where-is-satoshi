Nice thread, effort and great outcome.  I dont have the technical chops/patience and for others in the same boat, there is a business called Wallet Recovery Services.  I believe they have a 30% fee... which is better than a 100% of noting.  Just looked up their website and it seems like they are swamped with requests.

By the way, the remittance desk in your bank can send a chaser to see where in the SWIFT system it is.  Kraken should be asking you for the SWIFT reference number too, if they haven't already.  
A recall telex can be undertaken by your bank, it is upto the receiving bank to honor or not...hopefully they'll reply.  
Banks/Kraken have the same initial attitude that authorities have towards missing persons.... oh they'll turn up, dont bother us before 3-4 days etc.  Its your money, keep at it.  Good luck.
