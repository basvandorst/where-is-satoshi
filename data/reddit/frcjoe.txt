I don't think I've seen any pool that lets you completely change the coinbase, only append it with other data like a nonce or an additional sig.
Coinbasetx != fund transactions, there is only 1 coinbase tx and changes to the template that you would attempt to submit yourself would have errors due to the block hash not being correct.
BIP 0032's wiki entry dictates "Clients SHOULD assume their proposed block will remain valid if the only changes they make are to the portion of the coinbase scriptSig they themselves provided (if any) and the time header. Servers SHOULD NOT break this assumption without good cause." --That should (I'm assuming here) give us some insight that shows us if a client completely changes the coinbase, their block may become invalid.
There's some more code I need to dig through again, but i believe there are other things stopping the "stealing" of blocks from pools (most likely an extra nonce not shared with the miner, or another piece of the coinbase that gets added which the client is uninformed of. I just can't remember. it's too early here)

So far i have called 5 times to only get a voicemail (which btw you don't even know you are getting to, you only hear a rapidly said name you can't understand and a tone) and have emailed the account and got a bounced email reply from gmail.
wells-fargo FTL
Obviously they do not want to get any REAL imput on the issue or let community members in. smells fishy

No worries, I've been doing this for a long long time and I still at times forget things. Even "seasoned" devs on cryptos can have brain farts.
Glad you are enjoying bitcoin so far! Hope your app works out well, keep me informed (especially if you start working on alt coins). I friended you here on reddit as well.
Good discussion

AFAIK Eloipool's code (eligius) checks coinbases and will reject completely rewritten coinbases (only allows appended coinbases, not rewritten ones). BIP0022 provides for "bad-cb-prefix" responses. Described as "the server only allows appending to the coinbase, but it was modified beyond that".
Slush0's demo stratum-mining implementation does the coinbasing on the server side.
just a little bit of info, hope it helps

this person is correct. You must be crazy to downvote the truth
@_date: 2014-01-23 04:53:14
I already RSVP'd to go, i hope i made the cut off. I live about 3 hours away. Some of you may know me from FreiCoin but not many from bitcoin. I recently signed up for a bitcointalk account under the handle WASPJoe and will be assisting the WPC with running their pool. I am also going to BTC Miami so i hope to see you guys there!
P.S. I am shamelessly asking if anyone would chip in a few pennies towards my gas I am willing to ask questions provided by the community. My car is running on empty as it is and i borrowed funds to go to BTC Miami. I don't even have a bank account anymore (thank you bitcoin!) so i have only the funds to my name
Either way. thanks to OP for posting!
fingers crossed i made the 60 person limit

Awesome reply, thank you! I'm really tired right now, so if it is okay I will reply in the morning. I do agree that many stake holders in pos coins want nothing but the best and have the purest intentions for PoS. 
Something interesting posted earlier today on  that gives a bit of insight on one of the sides of the argument:
In the end, it's all going to be what the future holds though. I don't dismiss things (after all I run a FreiCoin pool and most dismiss the idea of demurrage), Always excited to see new ways to do things. 
Thanks again for a thoughtful and polite reply.

I like bitcoin as much as anyone else here, but sometimes you gotta look at things from both sides. Taking a look at the bigger picture helps put things into perspective.

Do we need another altcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-04 09:09:25
Not really, peercoin can prevent some of these issues, but the underlying issue of someone holding &gt;= 50% of the network's pow hashing power is still a problem in peercoin. it is also possible for a large stake holder in peercoin to cause some havoc. Peercoin's philosophy is that miners will not continue to mine PoW blocks for rewards as the difficulty goes up and the pow block reward decreases. I'm not quite sure if this will actually work, or cause a slow decay in the network power. (but that's philosophy)
for every hole that is fixed, another one arises.
I also dont think many bitcoiners will move to peercoin for a few reasons, and one of them being inflation. Bitcoin is a very vanilla store of wealth with simplistic rules most people can understand. PoS is a much different beast.
You might get some bad replies for this post... BUT, I'm interested in hearing the arguments and promise I won't flame you.

I didn't even think of that one. I bet a ton of people are cashing out their coins to pay those taxes they now need to pay on the coins.
Time to "Ride the wave" ;)
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:15:42
Great point, those who have been in the bitcoin game for a few years can remember that there were some massive swings in terms of percentages. it's just that the value per coin was less then than it is now.
@_date: 2014-06-04 09:10:07
My feelings are the same.
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:51:06
The S&amp;P Year to date is -0.83%, the DJIA Year to date is -2.45%.
Some financial stocks to keep in mind...
Goldman Sachs year to date is -12%, visa is -9.49%, diamond offshore drilling inc -15.52%

That sounds right on point. We're playing in a global game. We're playing with the big boys who know that they can sell off 10k of those coins for enough of a loss to keep the other 50k coins without any taxation.

Thank you very much!
Can you post a FreiCoin wallet address for me to send a donation to? 
@_date: 2014-01-23 09:00:50
I will let everyone here know.
I say we all phone in and ask for me to get in :)
start a "nuts" campaign like they did with the tv show Jericho
@_date: 2014-06-04 09:13:49
We sure do, but most bitcoin developers do not get much (if any) money from the community to develop bitcoin projects and thus bitcoin suffers as they look for other ways to put bread on the table. More developers are also needed for such a large market such as bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-04 10:22:37
Sure, but their finances are only part of the bigger idea that bitcoiners should support. I don't think that one particular organization should hold the responsibility for all of the funding. Also, there are a number of "core devs" who are severely underfunded (if funded at all). I think we all assume that bitcoin devs are making bank when not all of them are.
Either way, it's always good to support devs with our own money, it means more anyway :)
@_date: 2014-01-23 16:09:26
No I'm not sorry.
@_date: 2014-06-04 07:58:49
glad I could help, afaik you are allowed to either ignore tx's, or add your own (unannounced) transactions into the block as per the BIP. So in that sense, it allows a miner to have control over the entire network while still allowing the pool to protect themselves against attacks in the coinbase. That's one of the biggest factors that gives an advantage to pool mining on a GBT pool. Any miner in their right mind would not cut all tx in the block because it means a lower reward for them and the pool (but stranger things have happened).
Another cool piece of code in eloipool filters out "I support" flags which can cause exploits: 
A good pool op will have guards in place for activities they deem malicious, and selecting transactions to add to a block (imo) is not malicious. and if it was, every major pool would start to ignore blocks from that node as they are malicious. BitCoin is all about trusting in mistrust.

I think that there are a number of investors who did have bitcoin in 2013.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:25:09
Over this past summer when i did another show I would mention bitcoin and i always said it was "the next big thing in technology". It has become evident now. I believe (at least in some form) bitcoin will have a permanent place in society. I can't come up with a good way to introduce/describe it so any hints on how to do it without over-describing it would be great. (AKA, how would i tell my grandma about bitcoin).
Also, i'm looking at doing this live every week. I might do the segment tomorrow, if not then either friday or saturday. If its tomorrow it will be at about 0015/0030 EST, if friday it will be top of the hour 2300. saturday will probably be later than that. I could even do a 3 part starter series on it before i do the weekly segment.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:30:52
okay. well thanks for your time.
I do appreciate it
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:25:35
um. okay. what can i do to show you?
