Coinbase fees seem high anyway... They're the most well known, but are they the best? What about Kraken or CoinFloor

I sold for a small profit at 4300, expecting a dip. But I tried timing the market and have thus far been wrong. What with the price going to $4750.
Whatever you do, it's a gamble.

People can correct me if I'm wrong, as I'm a bit of a newb as well. But, I believe $25 isn't high enough to consider transferring your Bitcoin to a personal wallet. There are transaction fee's involved too. Enable phone verification at Coinbase and you should be fine.

Same situation here except I sold at $4300 hoping for a dip. But it's continued rising. I suppose I should take the loss and learn from your mistake and get back in now..

How much you bought so far? I'm having trouble convincing myself to get a full coin.

Mind if I ask why you want to buy 2500 USD of XRP, right at this moment?

There's always a milestone at different stages with different currencies. Who's to say 4000 Euros is a correction point, rather than 5000 USD?

Why would you want to cash out now?

My man buys bitmail ;)

I thought it was on the 25th!! God damn, I was being super cautious, reading a lot and thought doing it a day early would be fine...
If I send the funds now... and they don't make it through in time, if Coinbase give up BTG... would I get it in that circumstance..?

He made a fair comment. I've never heard of that site. We're sorry you may of lost your money.

Just wish I had more funds available to buy.

I sent a test amount an hour ago and it's stll pending too. Looks like I won't get mine out in time for the free shitcoin.

.. The feels when you're a Brit and can only SEPA into Coinbase (Fee's incurred are higher than straight up buying Bitcoin with a debit/credit card)

The 100$ increase has made you $1000 richer.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:43:36
Thought Coinbase paid higher fee's for this reason...
