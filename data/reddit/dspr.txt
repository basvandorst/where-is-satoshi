I don't know the details of Gox's internal situation, but speaking as a fairly senior software engineer, and as somebody familiar with the quirks of Bitcoin, and bitcoind, in a professional setting, I can say with confidence that it's a big technical challenge to make sure everything always works perfectly at the traffic scale that Mt. Gox operates at. And as their CEO Karpelas has said in the recent Forbes article, I can independently attest that the official bitcoind node software was designed to be correct, and POC, first-and-foremost, but it was not designed to operate at the data scale, that Mt. Gox in particular has to operate at. (For example, for a desktop wallet, the "correct" behavior is to flush the in-memory wallet state to disk fairly often, on any state mutation, and to ensure that's done atomically. That's fine when N is small (say, the total locally managed address count), but when N is huge (millions, for example) that flush takes a LONG time (which by server-side computing standards means 10 seconds or 100 seconds, etc.), and may cause clients to time-out, or traffic pile-ups, delays, etc. To give just a few problems caused by that effect. And/or you need lots of parallelization, and clusters, or aggressive garbage collection or archiving, etc. to help compensate for this.) It's optimized more for ordinary individual endusers, consumers, or a desktop wallet role, or as a reference software-only miner. So I have no doubt that Gox ended up writing their own custom Bitcoin nodes, because they felt that was the better trade-off to make. The advantage, as they've said, is they get the opportunity to tune it to their particular scale and use cases. The disadvantage is that they lose some of the optimizations, bug fixes and risk mitigation code that they would otherwise have gotten "for free", using a stock bitcoind node produced by Gavin's team.
And in software engineering, it's all about trade-offs: there's no one true perfect-always ideal, ever. Everything's relative. There are a lot of design decisions and architecture which work perfectly fine when N is small (like, 1, or 10, or 100) but will cause all kinds of painful delays or outright failures/crashes when N is very large (thousands, millions, billions). Again, that said, I don't know the internal particular details of their systems. But I do know it's very challenging from an engineering perspective. So it may be wise to assume mortal imperfections rather than malfeasance or incompetence. I've worked at some pretty large traffic scale shops (Orbitz.com) and even there you'd be surprised at how many things they didn't get perfectly right, all the various production emergencies they had to put out from time to time. A lot of the other exchanges have had the advantage of launching later, where more best practices had been accumulated, and where the baseline scale for total traffic they had to assume their architecture must handle, was higher. So they had lots of advantages that the Gox backend architecture and staff did not have.
And yes, the official bitcoind kicks ass at *small* to medium scale, in terms of local managed wallet size, and total active peer count. But under heavy traffic, or with huge wallet sizes, or under clever sustained attack/DoS, it has some imperfections and vulnerabilities. And that's to be expected. Perfection in all use cases, all permutations, is probably impossible to achieve in software development. With a single codebase, anyway. Especially with ones as young as found in the Bitcoin ecosystem. In contrast, folks have had *20+ years* to learn how to design a web server in bulletproof-ish ways (*cough* nginx). It will take time for Bitcoin to reach that point. But it can. And will.

agreed if only that it's in everyone's best interests if as many of Bitcoin's vulnerabilities and risks get fixed/mitigated, as *early* as possible, while the least amount of "real" money is at stake, and the least number of entities are using it. Better to have any disasters or fixes or tweaks occurring when the market is small than when the market is gigantic. Ship early, iterate, but fail really fucking fast in order to minimize loss, risk, and downside endgame scenarios.
I'm really optimistic about Bitcoin because "we the people" are much more in control over it than the legacy systems. The flip-side is the responsibility that comes with that. We the people need to do whatever we can, early, now, to make it better. We can. Therefore we should. Because the alternative is a system where we effectively cannot, regardless.

the average user is currently incentivized, out of convenience, to use the same address for every transaction with other parties. and/or to pool together outputs from addresses in his wallet that a malicious third-party could conclude, from observing the block chain, probably belong to the same entity (thus reducing his privacy). It's possible now for a user to manually pick and choose addresses, generate new ones, and be very paranoid, but not as many people do it either out of lazyiness or ignorance. If we upgrade Bitcoin -- at least the wallet clients in wide use -- to allow them to automatically generate, and draw from, pools of addresses -- on both the payer side and the receiver side -- it makes it more convenient for all parties to engage in this kind of obfuscation of the public record of their transaction history, and thus makes it harder for malicious observers to de-anonymize users. Not impossible. But much harder computationally. And part of the draw of Bitcoin in the first place is anonymity and privacy (in addition to speed and flexibility, of course, compared to the dinosaur legacy banking/government systems.)

A general class of criticism and risk around Bitcoin involves the existing ancient and universal phenomenon of... we *cannot* predict the future. Not precisely. Not consistently.
However we can *build* the future.
And so while Bitcoin is vulnerable to that first thing (the inability to predict the future) it also enables and is strongly susceptible to this latter thing. What would *you* like to build with it? How would you like it to be? How would you like to use it? How would you like it to be better? What risks would you like to see reduced? Now... Go do those things. Start helping out, somehow, anyhow, today. Or not. The choice is up to you.
It's also a currency/payment/wealth system that's designed/built/run disproportionately by engineers and entrepreneurs, not by politicians, lawyers, bankers or old money aristocratic interests. That may imply some... attractive qualities. If it does for you, great, participate. If it doesn't, that's fine, you're not required to. Relax. Carry on. Everybody be happy.
All this said, and to be more narrowly on topic, I do think it has a class of technical-related risks related to attacks, disasters and scale. I can't personally wave a wand and make them all go away. But I can exercise my brain and start investing time and effort to help mitigate them. To help make it better for all of us. I really cannot, in effect, do that with the government/banking/fiat/US/USD system. However much I might like to.
I've started to help. Have you?
