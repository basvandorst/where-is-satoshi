Your scenario for Coinbase only encapsulates coinbase=&gt;coinbase transactions. No? You can of course send Bitcoin many other places. To purchase goods, to friends running full nodes, or to your phone.

The volatility protection is just provided by a seamless purchase and then sending of Bitcoin in one step, from one page.

As well as...what? This isn’t actually a Lamborghini if that’s what you were thinking. That would be cool though. It’s a Mercedes and a pretty cool ride if I don’t say so myself. Probably used to be a work van for a Lamborghini dealership or something I guess. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:08:10
I understand your sentiment, but it sounds like you just need to get used to this scenario. Also, I think you are misunderstanding what is happening in the background with PayPal vs Coinbase. For instance, a Coinbase user can send bitcoin directly to another person running a full node on their computer and visa versa. Try doing that with PayPal.

Replying so I can find this comment later after I have had enough time to think on whether it deserves an up vote or down vote.
@_date: 2014-05-04 19:32:08
It really doesn't matter your intentions with the comment, what matters is your actual comment because that's what gets voted on and that's what gets brought to people's attention. Truly being nit picky or just trying to flex some wit, it really doesn't matter. The end result is that, if up voted, you have misdirected the conversation. 
edit: obviously this is a democracy of information to an extent here, I just don't always think the up votes and down votes work out for the best of the sum total.
@_date: 2014-03-23 05:29:26
Your comment got me thinking. In reddit's early years, a question, such as yours, that spurred debate or was at least a decent question would have never been down voted. Obviously when subreddits were created this effect became more prominent (circle-jerking, for those that need clarification), but it is nothing but fanaticism that you are being downvoted so heavily here. It's useful for everyone to get answers to questions such as yours, unless you are avoiding reality. 
On the other hand, I am curious why you spend so much time questioning and criticizing bitcoin. I didn't look at much user history, but is this account mostly for that purpose? Do you mind if I ask what you get out of the time spent? I think it's good to have arguments and have both sides of the story presented, I'm just quite intrigued by accounts such as yours. What's your vested interest?
MY ANSWER: 
I bought 10 btc at $4 and sold at $60. I believe it then fell back down a ways, and when it hit 100 for the first time I bought about 30 btc with the intent of it being a relatively long term, high risk investment.
Either being worth a lot in 3-5  years, or not much at all. 
I'm still holding. It would have to drop to $200 for me to panic sell. I can walk away with a 100% return and be happy that I went along for the ride. I wouldn't buy back in though until it hit $350, but I kind of doubt it will ever recover by that much if it goes below 200 again.

What do you mean by that, exactly? That may sound good in your head, but there are so many things wrong with that argument that I don't know where to begin. Perhaps if you elaborate I can understand where I should start. Don't take this the wrong way- I only wish to help you approach bitcoin more rationally. It's a great tech- it doesn't need to be propped up by non-sense and fanaticism. 
For what it's worth, I have invested in bitcoin a few different times and haven't sold any- just have spent a small amount and that is all.

Pretty incredible when you think about it. I think the rise of TOR and the rise of bitcoin are very much linked to the same things (more demand for privacy on the web, etc), but it is still interesting to look at it in such a way  that WikiLeaks' success has been practically dependent upon a coincidence. That bitcoin was there to provide a 8,000 percent return on their investment and allow them to stay afloat is lucky!
Someone please correct me if my statements are misleading–but I'm drawing this conclusion in light of the quote above.

lots of tiny companies have the potential to go through exponential growth or disappear off the face of the earth, but I don't think you can make the same quality argument for them as you can for bit coin. If you could, speculation would drive up the price anyway. Hence, my statement about "not talking about it". Bitcoin's price, even now, might be largely propped up by speculation itself, but it's got a lot of room to grow and there are lots of barriers to entry for new users/investors that have slowed adoption and dulled speculation so I think it's still a good investment long term. 
My opinion only, I've been following Bitcoin for a few years now but I'm no expert.

The way I see it, the use of a logarithmic scale makes the (indisputably significant) swings in price in the early stages more visible. To a fault or not, I suppose is up for debate. However, logarithmic scale or not, the data is the same: the pattern is there. 
A logarithmic scale makes an exponential growth curve look linear. Still, the scale of the y-axis can easily be manipulated to flatten or amplify the price as it tracks along a linear path, making the data appear to fit a linear line closer or more loosely. 
The same exponential growth rate can be seen on a linear scale, it just appears to be an exponential curve and not a straight line. To say that the "best fit" exponential curve does not fit the actual data because of the price decline from $1,200 to $450 I think is inaccurate given the circumstances.

I've been following bitcoin for 3 years now but I've mostly held all of the coins I've purchased, except for a couple online transactions. I have a business and was thinking of accepting bitcoin for retail transactions but am concerned with the time it takes to verify transactions. Do I have to wait 5 minutes for a few verifications? If I don't, can't a customer just cancel the transaction before it verifies, but after I have given them my product?
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:51:41
Makes sense. I understand double spending to be an overblown concern. I accept Bitcoin as a merchant and I don't require any confirmations.

Except credit card transactions are guaranteed by the CC company so that the transaction is instant for practical purposes. Get banks involved with Bitcoin and everyone bitches and moans...but it probably needs to happen because we need both parties to feel confident about the exchange in less time than it requires now. 
Edit: I think we need the services as an option is all.

Sounds healthy to me. The upside to bit coin is just hard to ignore. Very unique investing opportunity I think. If anyone knows of another investment with only medium-level risk and huge potential upside, they wouldn't talk about it.  Network effect + open source software and I don't see how any one but a coalition of the world's largest governments can prevent bitcoin from becoming king of crypto mountain.

No one wants to be duped so everyone is quick to yell scam. Honestly the fact that they don’t have a logo engraved on their prototype is probably a good sign. As a manufacturer myself who is too focused on my product to spend a ton of time on my website, I could even make the argument that it might be a good sign that their website is as bare as it is. I think if I was a scammer I would spend a little more time building up fluff and trying to convince people by going into detail, getting a laser engraved prototype, etc. Obviously the base level of validation from Adam Back is allowing this perspective, but the point stands.

Notice of Data Breach
 
Dear Gyft User,
We are writing to let you know about an incident that potentially involves your Gyft account. As described below, an unknown party may have gained unauthorized access to certain Gyft user information. We are taking this incident very seriously. As soon as Gyft learned about the exposure, we began investigating how this user information was accessed and what risks this potentially posed to Gyft customers. Fortunately, we have not discovered evidence that anyone used the information potentially compromised in this incident to access Gyft accounts or make unauthorized purchases. 
Nonetheless, please carefully read this notice. 
 
What Happened?
Beginning on October 3 and continuing through December 18, 2015, an unknown party accessed without authorization two cloud providers used by Gyft. This unknown party was able to view or download certain Gyft user information stored with these cloud providers and make a file containing some of that user information. 
 
What Information Was Involved?
The information potentially accessed from the cloud providers included names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, and gift card numbers. Gift card numbers could have been used to make unauthorized purchases. In addition, if you attempted to use Gyft between March 19 and December 4, 2015, your Gyft log-in credentials may have been compromised. An unauthorized party who acquired your credentials could have accessed your Gyft account and used any gift cards in your account with unused balances, or used available reward points or a Coinbase-enabled account to purchase additional gift cards. Importantly, no credit cards stored in your Gyft account were compromised because full credit card numbers are not visible in Gyft accounts and any credit card purchases require the three- or four -digit security code on the back or front of your credit card, which was not part of the information that may have been compromised.
 
What Are We Doing?
Shortly after discovering this issue, Gyft acted to prevent unauthorized access by forcing users whose passwords were potentially compromised to reset their passwords and logging out other affected users. Affected users who have not already done so will be forced to choose a new password the next time they log in. We also reset the Coinbase tokens for all affected customers. We are continuing to investigate the incident and will take all appropriate steps to protect Gyft customers. 
For the latest information on this incident go to: 
 
What You Can Do
We recommend that you change your password for any online account where you use the same password that you used for Gyft between March 19 and December 4, 2015. As discussed above, credit cards stored through Gyft were not affected by this incident. However, if you have a Coinbase account linked to your Gyft account, we recommend that you review any Coinbase transactions beginning in October 2015, because a linked Coinbase account could have been used to make purchases within your Gyft account. You should also monitor any gift cards that were in your Gyft account before January 8, 2016.
Although the information potentially involved in this incident does not affect your credit, we are required by law to provide you certain information about your credit report and identity theft. This information is enclosed. 
You may also contact us in writing at 150 W. Evelyn Avenue, Suite 300, Mountain View, CA 94041, or you can call us at 866-287-0504.
On behalf of Gyft, we regret any inconvenience this may cause you.
Sincerely, 
CJ MacDonald
Chief Operating Officer, Gyft
 
 
Additional Information Regarding Identity Theft and Your Credit Report
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) provides information about how to avoid identity theft and what to do if you suspect your identity has been stolen. You may contact the FTC at FTC Identity Theft Clearinghouse, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. 20580,  1-877-ID-THEFT (877-438-4338). You can also contact local law enforcement or the attorney general’s office in your state if you suspect that you have been the victim of identity theft.
You also may obtain a free copy of your credit report maintained by each of the three credit reporting agencies by visiting  or by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228. Review the reports carefully, and if you find anything you do not understand or that is incorrect, contact the appropriate credit reporting agency. 
You also may consider contacting the credit reporting agencies directly if you wish to put in place a fraud alert or a security freeze or to obtain additional information regarding identity theft. An initial fraud alert is free and lasts for at least 90 days. The alert informs creditors of possible fraudulent activity within your report and requests that the credit company contact you prior to establishing any accounts in your name. In contrast, a security freeze prohibits a credit reporting agency from releasing any information from a consumer’s credit report without prior written permission. Placing a security freeze on your credit report may delay your ability to obtain credit. 
To place a fraud alert or security freeze on your credit report, contact any the three credit reporting agencies using the contact information below: 
Equifax: 1-800-525-6285;  P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241
Experian: 1-888-EXPERIAN (397-3742);  P.O. Box 9554, Allen, TX 75013
TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289;  Fraud Victim Assistance Department, P.O. Box 2000,  Chester, PA 19022-2000

Well, not quite. The three points of greatest concern I think are:
1. Gyft card codes have been compromised- so any gyft cards in your account could have been spent (during a particular date range). 
2. Accounts linked to coinbase could have fraudulent purchases of gyft cards (and spending of those cards).
3. Users with poor password practices, who have other accounts online using the same email and password could be subject to further attack. 
So far as I can tell, I have not been affected. My gyft cards hold no current value, I didn't link my coinbase account, and I have good password practices. Not trying to be an alarmist, just woke up to this email and thought I would spread the word a bit. Gyft appears to be handling this properly after the fact, I just hope they recognize the high-stakes space they are in and don't let this happen again.

I've been using reddit since the end of 2006 and we've had our ups and downs. There's been a time or two where I really have to take a step back and realize just how dangerous the life inside some of Reddit's subreddits really is. You see up voted comments along the same thought time after time after time and it starts working on you on a subconscious level. I can remain critical of individual comments, no matter how much they are up voted, but the net effect can at times be frightening once you take a step back and realize you've been feeding yourself biased information. has to be the worst perpetrator of this mechanism that I have ever witnessed. It's like a damn vacuum in here. 
No offense, but have you ever invested in anything other than bitcoin before? Or, have you ever lost a "significant" sum of money in an investment?
I don't even want to argue about bitcoin's value and potential for growth. It doesn't matter— what you are saying is still irrationally confident.
