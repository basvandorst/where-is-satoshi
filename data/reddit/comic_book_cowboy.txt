Yea and most people dont have enough money to keep minimum balances, which are often thousands of dollars. Perfect example of theb rich getting richer.  Charge the poor for an account and give free accounts to the rich!

This is the biggest scam the banks have ever pulled.  Convincing the public to pay the banks so that we can let THEM borrow OUR money to invest and make themselves profit behind the scenes

Sold some mining cards on eBay near the end the big price climb. 4 months later the asshole tried to charge back saying they were "broken" when in reality they just weren't profitable to run anymore

Initially, yes. But I called and explained everything to them and after a few days of "investigation" they sided with me. I've had similar things happen and I've learned that calling and disputing it works WAY better than filing claims and shit online.

Bitcoin or gold?

That doesn't make a single bit of sense. First of all, nothing runs over 100% efficiency like that. That defies the laws of thermodynamics. 
Second, that's not how a heat pump works at all. A heat pump isn't pumping heat from the outside, it's just pumping in air then heating it as it enters your home. Why would you heat your home if it's hot outside? Just open a window

So you have absolutely zero idea how HVAC systems work.
Got it.

Lol I don't think the type of people buying Bitcoin at an ATM are spending thousands at a time

And I could wake up tomorrow with 3 extra dicks and be the first billionaire porn star by the end of the year
Anything is possible!

This is fucking retarded

Lol WUT
I can easily hide a bar of gold much easier than Bitcoin these days. All exchanges file reports to the government now. Bitcoin is the most regulated unregulated currency there is
