The fiat-to-crypto link is likely to be an issue for many years.   Blockchain based crypto is efficient but the banking systems that we currently have to interface with is 100s of years of madness.

I am not sure you can test UBI in this manner.  One major issue is that it ignores the "Universal" part.

Whether it is an intrinsic function, one thing that fiat currencies have that make them necessary is that governments make you pay your taxes with them.  We can debate if that is fair, but in any given country, the government has the right to tax you and to make you pay (e.g. guns and jails).

They are all smart, which is the problem.  Does the value proposition elude them, or are they purposefully attacking cryptocurrency driven blockchains to protect their own moats?

Bitcoin ATM at Coex in Seoul, Korea has no verification.  Cash in BTC out or vice versa.  However, there is still a USD 300 daily limit and there is a premium.
Fiat / BTC and vice versa is going to have a cost.  Earn in BTC and pay in BTC would be a great destination to get to.

We need more of this in government.  Unfortunately, that we are so surprised that an elected official is dealing with facts in an honest way is very sad.

Honestly, at first I thought this was a joke.
Then I thought, just poor reporting (you have to admit it sounds like some kid on youtube or the onion).
Then it hit me - this is collusion between the broken (and massively ignorant) traditional mass media and the US / state governments.  Un-be-lieve-able.

This ruling clarifies little.  And by saying it is barter, it completely goes against FinCen and Treasury rules.  One would think that the government would have to be consistent in their treatment.

As noted the protocol is designed to provide secure p2p transactions without a trusted intermediary (other than trust in the code and blockchain). 
But if you want to have successful ecosystem that utilized BTC, you do want well run, responsible companies involved.  The exchanges, where non-trading sites go for conversion and pricing, cannot be a crap shoot and occasionally blow up.

I am still confused - why is everyone complaining that "Core" is stopping progress.  So what if they disagree - either you have the majority who are willing to go with your hard fork or you don't.  If you do, then get on with it.  If you don't, then find out why you have failed to convince the majority and stop blaming 10 people hanging out in their clubhouse.  And if we are going to parse majority vs. consensus, 10 people do not make the difference. 
edit:  grammar

Local bitcoins is not popular in Korea, because it is not needed.  You can immediately do a bank transfer to the exchanges here for a couple of pennies and you can immediately withdraw from the exchanges the same way.  Said differently: Korea has super inexpensive bank transfers and the government is currently letting the market develop without interfering.
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:52:40
Why do we say "Core" is the cause of the problem  Since you need a hard fork, no matter who proposes it, could we not just say "XT, Classic, anyone else" are preventing growth by not creating a good alternative that users will choose over the current protocol?  I am NOT trolling.
@_date: 2015-01-24 12:39:02
I was mainly pointing out that local bitcoins is a bad proxy for korean interest. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:54:23
This. I do not understand. If it requires a hard fork, it requires a hard fork and anyone can do it.   If users want to consider a certain group of devs as the ones to follow, that is not their fault.
@_date: 2016-03-01 22:37:13
He might have said it should be temporary, but he also coded the protocol to require a hard fork to change it. I suppose what I am trying to say is what why cant we get the majority to agree to bigger max block size?

FUD to the FUD I suppose.  Many ETH purchases are not an asset rotation but just a second investment, as it is with me.  I did not liquidate BTC to purchase ETH, I just purchased ETH and still hold my BTC.

It is kind of perverse.

 \- get to issue bonds as silly low rates

Not necessarily, Starbucks sells gift cards and funds working capital via those cards, but they are not deemed securities.   An owner of a business that their shares in a trade (no cash goes into the company) is still selling a security.  It is more complex and statements such as all ICOs are issuing securities is dangerously broad.

Thanks.  I meant technically - what determines which fork is Bitcoin?   What if there both forks continue to be mined?  Is it whichever chain is longer? Whichever chain has more hashing power?  More nodes?  More  . . .?

This is what concerns me - is the block size increase being used as a ruse to get other changes made?  I hear that there are other changes, but I am not sure if they are material or not.

Thanks.  If typical upgrades do not require a fork, how do they work and what requires a fork?

How is this different from past software upgrades to the client?  Are they hard forks?

Active regulation that names cryptocurrency as its target is a far worse plan at this time.  It is better to worry about how governments can try to apply existing regulations than it is to concede control to them today.

Its not that you can file for patents.  It is that the USPTO grants patents that should not be granted:      
 - e.g. a flat black screen with rounded corners.      
 - click to make purchase.    
 - company name with "i" in it (OK, I made that one up)

The point is that the patent Apple was issued was vague enough to warrant a very large legal battle.   The point I am trying to make is that it is a screwed up USPTO vs. evil business issue.

Haha - No worries, I would not view going to a casino as an "invesment."     They will give you a bonus that has to be wagered 35 times before being withdrawn - fair enough it is a gift.  The issue is that if you deposit 100 and they bonus you 100, you cannot withdraw EITHER your deposit or the bonus until you wager it 35 times.
