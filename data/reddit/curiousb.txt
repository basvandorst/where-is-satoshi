Bit of an insult to have a headline like "$100,000 bitcoin very soon" on an Andreas talk -- he goes out of his way to avoid investment advice or talking about price. 
Then again, he's been saying for years this is hugely risky/dangerous to invest; yet if you ignored that advice and went all in on pretty much any coin a year ago you'd be up 10x or more.

True for bitcoin and some others, but not all these tokens are intended as currencies, and an alarmingly large number of them are sufficiently controlled by their dev teams that they could be hard forked to increase supply at the drop of a hat.

I can think of at least 4 enabling technologies:
* Proof of work
* Elliptic curve (public key/private key) cryptography
* Blockchain
* Peer to peer networking
Blockchain is just one type of distributed ledger. We also have DAG, block lattice, hashgraph, and probably others.

Here's the Andreas quotes. Nothing new for anyone familiar with his talks; he has always cautioned people about using bitcoin as an investment.

He's one of the experts you can actually usually trust because he's smart enough to *know what he doesn't know* in most cases. Hence, he doesn't have much of an opinion on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies other than they 'may' have a big impact on the financial industry.
@_date: 2018-05-28 00:39:41
I'm with you. I would say:
A small % of users believe Bitcoin Cash *is* bitcoin; they had a different vision from the main bitcoin "Core" developers and changed the code to suit their vision. The change resulted in a split of the blockchain, creating a separate version of the cryptocurrency.
The vast majority disagree including myself but I respect others' willingness to follow what they believe in. This is an essential characteristic of the open-source cryptocurrency movement: if you believe things should be different, you're free to change them and recruit others to follow you.

There are many teams working on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Here is a good list:
@_date: 2018-06-17 16:45:36
So I'm going to jump in here to say that nobody here knows why this wasn't submitted for peer review, but we can speculate several reasons: 
* Peer review helps the most in obscure fields where there are few experts capable of rigorously assessing the methodology and results for errors, but in this case the calculations are simple enough that many people can easily verify the results, so internal reviews among the team and their contacts may have been deemed sufficient.
* This is an informal study with a lot of 'educated guesses' on variables that make it less applicable to peer review
* The study's authors saw no benefit or had no interest in peer review, or the target audience was deemed not to care about whether there was peer review
* The authors were afraid that peer review would uncover the flaws in the study that make bitcoin mining seem much less energy intensive than it really is. 
Regardless, there is a huge amount of uncertainty in most of the key variables in doing a calculation on bitcoin energy consumption like this, so it should surprise no one that two studies have wildly different results.
The implication made in this thread is that perhaps we should trust the other study more because it is peer reviewed. That's an often valid, but incredibly lazy heuristic to use that's all too common among casual internet posts.
Perhaps we could engage in a more meaningful discussion about what differences in assumptions in each study led to the different results and why might one be more accurate than the other. I think the biggest difference is in the assumed efficiency (which is actually a detailed set of assumptions) of the average miner. Getting this value right depends on how much insider knowledge of the industry you have, in order to know what numbers the biggest players are looking at. Maybe consider the authors history and what insider knowledge they may have.
in the end, honestly 0.2% or 0.8% of world energy or whatever the actual consumption is, is insanely huge regardless. So I would doubt that they are trying to make bitcoin look more 'green' here.

There are many more than three strands. How about avoiding expensive international remittance fees. How about people who live in countries where they can't trust banks? How about countries where there *are no* banks. What if I trust the bank itself, but believe that they are susceptible to hackers? There's the recognition of the trend where personal economic privacy will be practically non-existent in a few years to decades if we continue to let central authorities manage and control our money. It's not just quantitative easing that makes fiat currencies lack long term value. There's an immense 'financial sector' built around controlling and manipulating currency that is a tremendous burden on the rest of society -- many of the brightest people pursue careers in finance where they contribute effectively nothing to society but the training of algorithms to manipulate markets to steal funds from the pensions of the working class and to pad their salaries (and suck more people into the industry). We are moving towards a cashless society -- maybe we don't want VISA to be taking 2% off of literally every transaction in the world, and store all that data in a central database? We'd rather submit to a trustless decentralized network than a handful of corrupt corporations.


They are, only because any "blockchain" is really only an experiment. In order to prove with any certainty that it is secure, it has to spend time in the real world, fend off real attacks, and demonstrate it's value to prospective users. Bitcoin has been active for 8 years and is the best example we have that blockchain actually works. Besides, the blockchain is only one of the technologies that makes up the bitcoin protocol.
All that aside, I find it hard to disagree with the notion that BTC could "correct" quite significantly at some point. I would caution anyone from going "all-in" right now.

I'm going to have to agree the chances that we never see sub-$7k BTC again are pretty slim. It's pretty risky to go all in at this point.
It's funny, even if we were still at $5k I'd have the same thoughts: it's pretty risky to get in now...could drop at any moment.

I generally agree with you but I really don't think selfishness of the devs is the issue. They are well aware of the scaling problem and want to resolve it, but the bitcoin protocol has a very delicate balance of power between users, miners, exchanges, merchants, etc., and any change even going from 1mb to 2mb, which may for the sake of argument cut fees in half, can really upset that balanceenoguh that it jeopardizes the future of the coin. 
It's not that people are selfish and refuse to give up power, it's about protecting the integrity of the original design so that bitcoin is still around 10, 20, 100 years from now. 
Every scaling option has to be considered carefully. Every scaling option that requires a hard fork of the protocol needs complete unanimity to succeed both practically (otherwise we end up with the current situation, which I believe is blown way out of proportion) and theoretically, otherwise it would be too easy to change and manipulate. 
That's why devs  worked so hard to get segwit done with a soft fork and hold conferences like "Scaling Bitcoin" so that the way they choose to scale is the right one, the first time.
I feel you that bitcoin is a "rich persons luxury", but it's a cost of the extremely cautious, deliberate, careful process of developing a decentralized trustless currency that will actually stand the test of time. I almost feel like devs are OK with high fees and slow transactions because it's growing *too fast* and hope those obstacles will slow adoption to a reasonable pace. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:10:57

@_date: 2017-11-07 20:08:46


Yes but you need to mine 2000 blocks to get the net difficulty adjustment, which could take a while if there's very little hash power.
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:27:41
You should set up a few of these:
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:27:57
You do. But if your coins are on an exchange, they can be traded sooner because exchanges don't rely on the blockchain to immediately settle transactions.
If your coins are in a wallet, you'll want to wait for the dust to settle, so to speak, before sending BTC or B2X anywhere so you can be sure you're sending the right coin to the right chain.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:04:03
He said he's referring to crypto market cap as a whole and a lot of value has gone into alts, so it makes some sense that BTC is not quite at 10k yet.
However, it's interesting that the trend appears to be continuing to hold up for BTC alone (a log regression fits the data really well):
But for the whole cryptocurrency market cap, it doesn't (price rise the past few months has greater than the regression predicts):
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:15:48


Holy shit. That's outrageous. I think looking at the kWh/transaction metric should be a priority.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:42:28


There's a small number now, but the value is there and it will attract devs. Plus any improvements to Bitcoin that don't rely on segwit can be copied over to Cash; they're based on the same code.


What infrastructure? More hashpower in BCH than BTC. Merchants will move to BCH if it continues to hold/rise in value becuase it is cheap and fast to transact with. Most exchanges support Cash; I'd give Coinbase a couple months.


Who knows? Users, developers, supporters? Maybe they're all paid for by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu???
I personally don't see what BCH does that's better than LTC. Either way, this chaos and volatility at the whims of the big players it just part of the growing pains of crypto. I just hope BTC crashes so I can pick some up cheap...
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:48:19
I'll just add that a lot of other cryptocurrencies are tackling this problem.
One of the most innovative is IOTA, which uses a distributed ledger called a directed acyclic graph instead of a blockchain. You may want to investigate; this electronic money phenomenon is still very new and so I'd be hesitant to extrapolate bitcoins current impact too far into the future.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:38:01
here's the process:
1. Get your cards and rig set up. I recommend 1080Ti's. 
2. Benchmark your hash rates. 
3. Enter your hash rates on whattomine.com and look at the profitability of mining various coins. Pick one to mine that's not too volatile.
4. Join a mining pool. 
5. Join an exchange. 
6. Schedule regular payouts from the pool to your exchange address (or private wallet if you prefer). 
7. Transfer your mining earnings to the exchange (if youre using a private wallet) and exchange the coin for BTC or whatever crypto you want to own. Do this on a regular basis; i.e. weekly or monthly.
8. Transfer that crypto into a cold wallet on a regular basis.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:07:28
There is little evidence this is happening. The hash rate has dropped significantly since the last adjustment and there is a forecasted difficulty adjustment in 4.3 days (the last such adjustment before the fork) that will lower difficulty by ~28%. 
Also as part of your post-fork strategy you should flood the original chain with transactions congesting the network as much as possible. Inability to make transactions and high fees will push down the price probably more than trying to accumulate all the BTC yourself beforehand and sell it off post-fork.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:26:08
I'm not sure how you got that from my comment? The point was how something decentralized has to be developed carefully. In terms of attacks, the past 8 years proves how hard it is to attack bitcoin, and each time it is attacked a weakness is revealed and it becomes stronger.

Consider that a percentage of bitcoins are lost forever due to missing private keys, and a much larger percentage (I'd guess) is in cold storage. A lot is held on exchanges belonging to long-term holders and people who don't check the markets regularly.
A small remaining percentage is actually allocated to sell orders on exchanges and contributes to price discovery. In order to materially affect the spot price of an asset, all that is required is sufficient demand to satisfy the supply of current sell orders under a given price on the order book at any given time.
I don't buy in to the "Tether conspiracy" myself, but hopefully that helps answer your question.

I can speculate. Higher difficulty can make it more profitable to mine other cryptocurrencies. The last difficulty adjustment appears to coincide with a spike in hash rate of bitcoin cash (Oct. 27):
But that only lasted a couple days.

I was not convinced by the Brazilian/Argentinians.


What exactly is decentralized consensus, apart from the success of select parties to persuade the majority that their proposal is the best path forward?
I personally think the Core team should be the de facto leaders. I see why they oppose the hard fork, and generally side with them. But if the consensus cuts them out, then so be it.

Bitcoin Gold changed the hashing algorithm so there's no chance of network interference.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:32:03


The idea of the attack is that if miners and the user base begin using the 2X chain, it will no longer be profitable to mine the original chain so it will "die off" and 2X will be BTC. I don't view that outcome as probable, but it is possible.
If there's consensus around a hard fork, it's a pretty smooth procedure adn teh new fork replaces the original currency. Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum have had hard forks and have more coming up, watch and see.

Jihan Wu found out about bitcoin early on, and had the instincts to go 'all in', betting it would be the future of money. 
Not being a programmer himself (business background I believe), he decided to focus on bitcoin mining, and found a computer hardware expert (the story is he ran into him on the street by chance) who he hired to design a chip to mine bitcoin as efficiently as possible.
'Bitmain' was born. Since then, as the owner of the design for the most efficient mining chips, Jihan has built an empire of manufacturing mining rigs and operating mining farms. 
He has supported 'bitcoin cash', arguably because larger block sizes favor miners. He has also pushed bitcoin to increase the block size.
However, Jihan is still respectful of the bitcoin community, and critical of the BCH community at times. Some recent tweets:

Congratulations on taking the first step towards real financial independence. Being your own bank gives you a lot of power. But with great power comes great responsibility. The only way to understand the gravity of this responsibility and become comfortable with it is with experience. Get a paper wallet. Get a hardware wallet. Get a software wallet. Learn their strengths and risks. Realize that if you lose access to your wallet, there's NO ONE* who can get it back for you. It is on you to store your private key / password and not lose it.
* It is possible to recover your wallet in some rare cases depending on how it's stored.

No, he said he holds everything because he doesn't know what's going to be the most valuable long-term. He holds BTC, BCH, and a bunch of alts.

First, thanks for taking the time to post here and address this. 
As an editor, you have clearly gone to lengths to ensure your reporting is grounded in reality and have done us readers a service by linking to the git commits upon which the article is based. Thanks for that, too.
However, I would respectfully disagree that the article "contains no sensationalism".
The intent of the textbook's references to a block explorer is only to allow the reader to explore information contained in blocks to further their understanding of the bitcoin protocol. Up until mid 2017, blockexplorer.com was a great source for this because all it was was a block explorer. They since added news, video links, and more recently a message taking a strong stance on the BTC/BCH divide. 
Regardless of the stance taken, this is inappropriate and distracting in the context of learning about blockchain contents. 
So Andreas's revision was not grounded in a position of his in regards to the debate itself, as your article implies, but in the interest of keeping textbook material strictly non-partisan.
The article implies that Andreas is taking a position in the debate against Bitcoin Cash, which he is not. The position he is taking is against *propaganda of any kind* in the context of a textbook.
Referencing "each coin’s community growing less tolerant of the other over time" without any evidence is particularly sensationalist, and the call to action of "Should references to Bitcoin Cash be removed from canonical texts? Let’s hear your thoughts in the comments." is highly disingenuous. 
Although I doubt Andreas will dignify your shameless response ("strive for objectivity"?, please...) with a comment or provide you with any comment for future articles, I will say that from my observations he likely views the opportunity for a subset of the bitcoin community to fork off the main chain over a disagreement in how the protocol should be advanced as a necessary feature of a completely decentralized, open, borderless, system, regardless of what his personal opinion on block size, scaling, or protocol development in general may be.

You should differentiate between science and scientism:
Science: evidence-based skeptical inquiry. asking questions, hypothesizing, testing, admitting limitations, ruling out competing hypotheses, documenting proof. Falsifiability.
Scientism: Opinions of scientists and studies in peer-reviewed journals answer all questions. Take the opinions of top scientists/experts as fact. Draw conclusions from limited evidence, treat them as fact in the absence of competing evidence. etc.

People only focus on these things because they are the things that BTC is *not* good at. But they are solvable with second-layer technologies and incremental improvements. 
The decentralization, censorship resistance, and proven resilience to all kinds of attacks has established a level of credibility for BTC no other coin can hope to achieve any time soon. 
That's not to say better alternatives won't usurp bitcoin, but its the highly conservative, security focused approach (as opposed to scalability focused) that makes bitcoin a trustworthy store of value -- so, for now, my view is the whole crypto ecosystem is relying on bitcoin to succeed.

Yeah I don't think that "allowing immigration" in and of itself is debasing citizenship. I interpret "debasing citizenship" as any government activity that infringes on the rights of citizens, like civil forfeitures, mass surveillance, etc.
I mean I see crypto doing a lot of great things, but I'm not sure it's going to be able to stop immigration...(or that we'd even want it to). If anything I'd hope that crypto enables foreigners to establish credibility linked to their identity to make it easier to vet them in the immigration process.

1 uBTC= 10^-6 BTC. 1 sat = 10^-8 BTC.
1 sat = 10^-2 uBTC.
1 b = 10^-3 kb
1 sat/byte = 10^-2 / 10^-3 = 10 uBTC/kb

You've got it backwards. Gold jewelry is prized because gold as a store of value symbolizes wealth and status. The few narrow industrial applications of gold are insignificant and irrelevant to its value as money. 


Gold was and is used as a currency. It is challenging to transact very large or very small amounts hence it is rarely used. Distributed ledgers might change that, but that's another story.


Volatility creates risk, but does not negate BTC's properties that make it an effective store of value. 


You sound very confused. BTC has maintained it's value better than almost any other coin in this bear market. There are many use cases even today, and it's still early in development.

Energy expenditure is a key foundation for any currency with the properties of "good money", insofar as we understand what makes good money through theory, practice, and history.
Bitcoin is designed to mimic the properties (and improve the usability) of the best known store of value throughout history: gold. Gold has been an excellent store of value for centuries precisely because you have to spend energy to obtain it: prospect to find ore bodies, drill to verify the gold is there, construct and operate a mine, and process the ore to extract the gold. It also has other key properties: i.e. it does not degrade, is malleable, difficult to fake, etc.
The development of bitcoin is intentionally extremely conservative, and the "proof of work" (PoW) hashing algorithm that mimics the energy expenditure of gold mining is the most secure, fair, and proven (tested for over 10 years now) means of securing the network. 
Other cryptocurrencies are experimenting with alternatives and modifications to PoW, and that's great. There are many reasons to believe that alternatives could work as well or better than PoW so it's great that there is so much experimentation going on.
But bitcoin isn't about experimentation. The goal is to ensure that above all else, it functions as an effective store of value.

Last I heard, the implementation of bulletproofs in Monero is set for September. It was going to be March, but they wanted it to have more time on testnet and more reviews before launching. They seem to have a big emphasis on doing it right over doing it fast.
Also, there was some flaw early on that may have compromised some of the privacy aspects of Monero, so to say every transaction from the very beginning being private is slightly misleading. Also there is some worry that Monero forks will have the effect of possibly linking transactions to addresses through comparing RingCT inputs or something.
Anyway it still seems to be the coin of choice for laundering stolen crypto, so I guess that makes it the king of privacy (even though technically ZCash zero-knowledge proofs are theoretically more private).

November could be a very volatile month....I'd wait and buy in a little each week looking for dips, accumulating your bitcoin slowly between now and January.

You can't think about BTC in the same way you think of any other investment. The only similarity is that price is a function of supply and demand.
Bitcoin represents a global paradigm shift in how value is stored and transferred. There is no precedent, except perhaps the adoption of paper money in the 15/16th century, but that's not really relevant. The same way there's no precedent for the internet, except maybe the printing press.
2017 marks the year that people and institutions are beginning to take cryptocurrency, generally, and bitcoin specifically, seriously. This is a deflationary asset, so what happens when everyone decides they should own a small chunk of it as a hedge? The value has to go up.
We can continue to create free money as long as there is a steady stream of new players entering the system, and as long as everyone continues to have faith in the robustness and trust of the system.
That said, I agree that at this point there's certainly a risk of a correction.

There's always FUDDing...S2X is being portrayed as a huge threat and BCash is marketed as the 'real bitcoin'.

Markets 101: If we knew what was going to happen, we'd all buy or sell accordingly and the market price would take our predictions into account.
Advice is the same as always: DCA is the low risk strategy, yolo is the high risk strategy. Consider the risks (upside &amp; downside) amplified somewhat due to uncertainty over the upcoming hardfork (attack).

I asked this question earlier and am still trying to get to the bottom of it.
There seem to be some legitimate concerns about the way its being done, but I'm not buying the arguments that going to 2MB blocksize is a huge threat (lots of altcoins use various different block sizes).
The strongly defensive attitude here ("We must brand B2X as an attack on bitcoin, all supporters are traitors" etc.) comes off as superficial; like there are deeper disagreements and personal rivalries playing out behind the scenes.
Some links that may help shed light:

1) No, unless the sidechain is controlled by a centralized third party. If it's decentralized, you only have to trust the sidechain protocol itself, like bitcoin.
2) No, unless the sidechain developer so chooses.
3) Yes, provided the sidechain developer chooses so.
4) Yes.

And look at the number of threads here hating on segwit2x. There's a level of toxicity on both sides.


There's a lot of money/power/control at stake here; it's part of the design that bitcoin is very hard to change to prevent any one group or person from seizing control - that's why you need 'consensus'. Unfortunately this change-resistance is also holding back real development that's needed to adapt to growth and changes in usage (scaling). 
Cryptocurrencies are still a new technology. This is part of the process of learning how they work, finding out how fights over control play out, what strategies and techniques and propaganda campaigns work for winning public, miner, and developer support. Does the bitcoin governance model even work at all? Will it stagnate forever in a stalemate as no party is willing to compromise for the greater good? Will it be subject to continued forking on a monthly basis? 
Other cryptos are trying to learn from these controversies and come up with ways to subvert them and create a more adaptable, yet resilient and still robustly decentralized digital coin. But they're all still small and haven't had to face any real battles for control. Bitcoin is 7 years old and valued over $100B now, that's real money; real money means real fights for control. No wonder the BCash tribe is fighting so hard to claim they're the "real bitcoin". And no wonder the 2x hard fork is so contentious.

Right. The idea is in case it goes down a lot, you won't be buying all in at a peak.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:39:27
It's not the technology that makes a cryptocurrency valuable. It's longevity and proven resistance to threats - proof that only comes from a gradual rise in value with repeated attacks to which users and developers adapt and harden themselves against. 
Bitcoin has been around way longer and has way more value than any other crypto. That's why it's king.

My advice is don't go all in all at once. Maybe buy £1,000 worth every week for the next 10 weeks. If shit hits the fan (i.e. there's a huge crash), you can pause and wait for prices to bottom out.

Once BTC is bigger and transactions are dominated by real adoption -  i.e. being exchanged for goods and services - rather than speculation, the crazy volatility we are seeing will disappear. The hope is that once this level of ubiquity occurs, we will see BTC being a better 'unit of account' than USD; a better measure of real value.
There are lots of reasons why this may or may note end up happening; but that is the long term intent.

The BCH people would probably argue that implementing segwit even as a soft fork was an attack on the 'original bitcoin'. 
The S2X people would probably argue that not increasing blocksize or quickly resolving scaling issues is a form of attack on bitcoin.
I would agree though that the proposed S2X hardfork is definitely an attack on core.
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:33:50
BCH is anti-segwit. Segwit is a modification to the bitcoin protocol which I don't think Satoshi knew about or intended for it to be part of his bitcoin. But Segwit is a necessary step towards a range of scaling options like Lightening Network, sidechains, etc., that will enable fast, cheap transactions of thousands per second without overloading the network and without massively increasing block size.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:44:13
I'm not sure it's a blitzkreig approach, the New York Agreement was what 6 months ago? That was an attempt at consensus among many players, but notably excluded core. 
I could see it argued that a block size increase is needed now (or at least its a good time), and to do that you need a hard fork regardless. Seems like it wouldn't be that bad to do it now, but I guess there's longstanding tension between the NYA signatories and core.

From what I've heard Andreas has stayed pretty neutral. Any source on his support for Core or dislike for Ver?

Bitcoin Cash had to implement the EDA (Emergency Difficulty Adjustment) in order to make mining it profitable. The EDA is essentially "gaming" the mining incentives as you heard, but was also necessary 'life support' for it to survive.
As far as I know, there's no difficulty adjustment in the 2X fork; the intent is to fully replace the 1X chain and become the one and only bitcoin.
A number of things will go down during the fork that will affect confirmation times and mining:
* If a majority of miners move to one chain (some claim 50-80% will mine the 2X chain), the other chain hash rate will drop, and without a difficulty adjustment, confirmation times will slow.
* During the fork there is a risk of replay transactions (double spending), and other network issues. Most people will probably hold their coins and wait for the dust to settle, so there may be fewer transactions than normal on both chains.
* At the same time, expect price manipulation from both sides vying to become the 'more valuable' coin, as well as attempts to congest the opposing network with loads of self-transactions to make it appear unstable
* Bitcoin Cash is hard forking again on Nov 13th with a new difficulty adjustment algorithm, probably hoping to capitalize on the uncertainty around the 2X fork and capture hash power (miners)

Who is upvoting this nonsense? Bitcoin's value fluctuates wildly on a weekly basis and is driven by speculation on its potential as a replacement for fiat as a medium of exchange and ultimately store of value.

Not ironic at all. He accepts USD too and bad-mouths it just as much. If you're a seller you take whatever your customers are willing to pay with, and trade as needed to balance your holdings between fiat/crypto/metals/real estate/stocks/etc.
It's obvious watching him speak about bitcoin that he just doesn't get the significance of digital scarcity and distributed consensus, which is fine, a lot of old-school economists and goldbugs don't. 
However, he's practical enough to understand how bull/bear hype cycles work and that holding a small position in BTC is smart from a risk/reward standpoint even if you don't believe in the underlying technology.
