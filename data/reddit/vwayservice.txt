thanks ... you explained very well...
oh, yes i signed up for 10% referral link 
btw...i don't find any link referencing bitmex that you recieve maker fee ... i think in my case I paid that -0.0225% fee [total- $2.50 x 2= $5 ]	(i cant find balance before/after every order... so cant calculate)
(correction : kraken says that you get fee... what they really mean is that you get fee to pay -
