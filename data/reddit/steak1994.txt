I already know about this list, but this still won't explain what makes the Coinbase Wallet bad or untrustworthy (I don't get the hate for Coinbase btw, yes you have KYC but that's pretty much a must have in Europe) getting started via Coinbase.Earn + having a fast and secure way to buy Crypto with minimal Fees from Coinbase Pro... I see that there are many Wallets and i will try some for myself, I would be glad if my question still can be answered from someone who has first hand experiences and doesn't just refer to a list without any real reasoning with pro/cons for my choice

It's a dedicated private Wallet for iOS and android called Coinbase Wallet (private Key included) the coins are no longer stored on an online exchange...

I understand every aspect of the message you want to convey and I'm very well responsible for my actions :) my point still is do you have any actual arguments against this specific wallet except the fact it isn't on the list? Yeah it's evil coinbase and i will continue to buy my coins there so a base of trust is already there till now they never disappointed me, if you can explain to me what makes the other wallets better or more secure I'm gladly here to listen and learn. Still for a beginner a Coinbase private mobile Wallet should still be 10 times better than leaving the coins on the Exchange...

In fact I did some research and nothing really spoke against the Wallet Coinbase provides. The Wallet is on mobile (Android/iOS) and is private also offline usable but you can move funds from the Exchange into your wallet directly what makes it really convenient and usable when i buy my BTC via Coinbase Pro - moving fiat to Coinbase sending the Fiat to Coinbase Pro, purchasing BTC with minimal Fees then sending it to my Wallet. I just wanted to get some first hand experiences from someone who is using or has used this wallet or someone who can tell me why I maybe shouldnt use it. Sorry if that wasn't clear enough in my original post.
