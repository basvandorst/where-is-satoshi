This is easy peazy.  Use electrum. Don't dick around with sweeping keys as others have suggest.  You ain't got time to pay transaction fees twice.
Since you're real fuckin salty you are going to do your signing offline.  Do a goggle for "Electrum offline signing" or some shit.  But here is the gist:  
On your internet computer, the one you use for all pronz, you are going to create a read only wallet.  Electrum is going to ask you for the pub keys or priv keys.  You are going to enter the pub keys of the paper wallet.  Then you are going to pretend to spend that shit to your new trezor wallet but electrum won't let you sign it cuz it aint got your keys.  But, you can save the details of the transaction to your usb thumbdrive.  
Then, you go over to your no internet machine and you create another readonly wallet, this time you enter your priv keys and then you load the transaction that you saved on your usb.  THen you sign that transaction and save the signed tx to your usb.  At this point you know where we are going, take it back to your malware infected pron box and load the signed tx and broadcast.  
It's been a minute since I have done this so some details might be a bit scratchy.  Like i said, goggle that shit.

It amazes me that developers build clients for windows.  Every one should come with a disclaimer before installation warning them about the likely hood of their btc being stolen.  Don't access private keys with substantial balances on a windows machine.  I don't care if you are the grand guru of windows security, it's ignorant.  
If you want to spend btc on windows great, transfer a small amount from one of your significant addresses to a petty cash address via linux live cd.  Then use the petty cash address on windows for spending and if it gets stolen at least you don't lose your entire bankroll.

Bip32 encrypted keys uploaded to amazon , google drive and dropbox.  If you are using strong passwords, and assuming you never type these passwords on a windows machine you are good to go.  No need to bury anything, hide anything under the bed or any other great depression era security techniques.

They said exactly what they wanted to say.  I am convinced they are trying to drive the price down as low as possible so they can buy up btc and possibly cover their asses once they re-open the exchange.  I have a feeling they have been fractional reserving our btc.

Yeah, I imagine, good luck to you!

I wrote a little script in javascript based off bitaddress.  You paste in your private keys on the left, the corresponding public keys are generated on the right.  It's how I verify all my keys.  About to head out, but if you are interested PM me and I can upload the code to github.

Such an obvious solution, how has this not been thought up and implemented sooner?  Great find, great writeup!

If your coins ever become dependent upon a piece of paper, you are doing it wrong.  I don't care how many cool holograms, or sweet designs people come up with to symbolize your btc, paper should never be involved in the process.

It's a possibility that they are working on that now.  Whose to say ghash isn't the product of a classified project or a company funded by wall street to eventually destroy bitcoin?

Before using a coinbase account the first thing you should do is enable 2FA.  This goes for any website you use that involves bitcoin.

About a month ago I built a web based read-only bitcoin wallet and figured I would see if I could get some feedback here.   For those who aren't familiar with a read-only wallet it basically allows you to see balances of addresses without ever loading private keys.  Basically you paste your PUBLIC addresses in and it will show you the balances in your choice of:   
*  btc   
*  mbtc  
*  ubtc.  
The value of your wallet is updated every 10 seconds via bitstamp or mtgox.  And you can view the value of your addresses in 17 different currencies.  It will also check your addresses every 5 minutes for new transactions and if an incoming or outgoing transaction is detected it will let you know.  
Your public addresses and your configuration settings are stored in your browsers local storage.
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:57:59
The technology is very simple, 99% of the code is in the client side javascript, on the server side a php call is made to the blockchain.info api to get the balances of your addresses, a second api call is made to either mtgox or bitstamp to get the current price.
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:27:18
Thanks for the feedback I appreciate it.  Kind of a niche tool I believe, I have an obsession with wanting to know the realtime value of my addresses, I also have a phobia against having a hot wallet open for any time longer than necessary.
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:01:04
Why would i need to pass on a bitcoin address with writing or speech?  I have made a few payments with bitcoin, I have received a few payments with bitcoin, and never has speech or writing been an issue.  Click a link, point your camera at a qr-code, copy/paste etc...

Malware, spyware and the fact that we now know that the NSA, and we can only assume other agencies, have collaborated with Microsoft as well as Apple to create back doors into these operating systems.  Couple that with the fact it has been revealed that NSA employees have used spying tools to spy on friends and family for personal use and it's just not something I am comfortable using.  What if some NSA, CIA, or FBI employee decides to use these tools to steal a few bitcoins here and there?  I will play it safer and stick with linux.

Read-only javascript wallet, all data is stored on your browsers local storage.  Just paste your public addresses.  Two exchanges, 17 currencies, it updates once every 10 seconds, and will notify you of incoming/outgoing transactions:

After noticing the terrifying stats regarding the amount of downloads for the bitcoin-qt signatures/hashes, essentially nobody uses them  coupled with the effort in manually setting up a live cd every time I want to move bitcoin I decided to write a bash script to automate the process.    The script allows you to select the tools you want and then it downloads the installers/signatures, imports the authors public key via pgp.mit.edu, validates the authenticity of the installer and on success installs the selected software.  The following tools are currently supported:  
* Bitcoin-Qt
* Multibit
* Armory
* Electrum
* Truecrypt  
The script has been tested on Debian 7.2  i386 and amd64.  I am going to try and add support for Ubuntu over the weekend, at this point I believe everything should work for Ubuntu with an exception of armory.

You haven't explained how it is safer.  You can literally do the EXACT same thing with an OS running on a thumb drive.  Anything you can do on the raspi in terms of running wallet software offline or online you can do with a persistent version of linux running on a thumbdrive.   If you are running debian on a raspi and I am running debian on my laptop via thumbdrive and both environments have touched the internet one time to download our tools of choice how is that different?  
  
There isn't anything magical about a raspi, it's a small computer that typically runs linux, that doesn't make it superior to a big computer running linux.
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:57:07
That one specifically has puppy linux installed on it which supports persistence.   The file system is encrypted.  Thats about it, nothing fancy.  I run multibit on it.  I don't use this much anymore because I am not a huge fan of puppy linux.  
My current setup is Debian 7.2 running from a live cd.  There is no persistance, but I kinda like it that way.  I automate the download and installation of the tools I like using this bash script:  
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:53:18
So lets say I use bitaddress.org to print out QR codes for an address.  Lets say the private key I use starts with a  5 so it represents an uncompressed key.  I then accidentally use the compressed public address to have funds sent to me.  Am I screwed?
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:13:16
Fire up a linux live cd/usb and setup any of the popular wallets.  Using linux helps insure that your btc aren't stolen through a windows virus or some such.  It also prevents a back door in Windows or Mac, which we know exist, from being used to steal your btc.  This way your btc aren't low hanging fruit and you don't have a live client running on your daily use OS.  Then try and forget about them, of course backup your wallet files to multiple locations and don't forget your passwords.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:02:45
If things go wrong then yes people need to hear about it.  However, having to wait a few hours for a withdraw to hit the blockchain isn't something gone wrong.  It doesn't justify telling people that an exchange is broken.  It's completely normal for this to happen on occasion.  Again, we see these posts at least once a day, all they do is cause panic.   
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:48:05
Do you have any bitcoin?  If not your first step in getting involved is to acquire some.  Also, setting up a full node to help increase the overall processing power of the bitcoin network.  Two very simple things but very important in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:57:35
So freaking obvious, my bad.
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:22:49
Running a full node requires running the bitcoin client 24/7 with more than 8 connections.  Basically you are relaying transactions, it is different than mining.
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:27:28
The private keys are backed up in a Truecrypt encrypted volume in various places, the cloud, cd rom etc...  If I lose the thumb drive it's no loss, just create a new one.  If someone finds the thumb drive they can't do anything with it other than boot their computer into linux.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:26:32
I built an app that does similar, basically a javascript read only wallet.  It monitors incoming/outgoing transactions, 19 currencies, two exchanges, and btc displayed in btc, ubtc, or mbtc.  All public addresses and settings are stored in your browsers local storage.  
@_date: 2013-12-29 23:53:21
Why would anyone want to run their wallet on a raspi?  Not trying to be rude but I just don't get it.  A Live CD or USB thumbdrive with your OS/wallet of choice seems like a better option to me.

Interesting stats, bitcoin 0.8.5 installation packages averaged 111,000 downloads per week.  The hash file downloads for their installers averaged less than 100 downloads per week:  
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:57:45
We need to stop allowing posts like this, there is one almost once a day.   
**PSA, BEWARE, HALP!  I withdrew btc from XYZ exchange, it's been 2 hours and nothing is in the blockchain.  Beware that XYZ isn't processing withdrawals.  You have been warned...doom, gloom, apocalypse...**  
Seriously, it happens, don't shit your pants.  It can take some time especially if they are having to pull btc from cold storage.   And if it does happen don't post here.

Why do you assume that a thumb instance of linux has to have an internet connection?   Again, we are doing the same thing.  You could easily connect your Debian raspi to the internet or not connect it to the internet.  Same with running it from a USB stick.  I in fact never run my USB linux with an internet connection as I typically use it to carry out tests to verify my private keys periodically.  The only time I ever had it connected to the internet was to download my wallet program.  Since then it hasn't touched the internet.
Maybe you are unfamiliar with how running from a USB stick works.  I boot my computer which typically runs windows from the USB, debian is loaded into memory instead of windows, the windows OS isn't running at all.  There is no internet connection unless I connect the computer to the internet or specifically enable the wireless adapter.  In fact my old computer I use has an on/off switch for wifi.  When I boot into linux this switch is turned off for additional peace of mind.

all this function does is gets the last traded price of bitcoin.  He uses google spreadsheet to most likely enter the units of btc that he owns and then uses this function to grab the last price and calculate the current value of his holdings.

Debian is a better alternative, ubuntu doesn't seem to have much concern for privacy.
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:33:39
Keeping an eye on this, looks promising.  Hoping you get some feedback from the community.

Wrote a bash script that automates all this for Debian, most likely works for Ubuntu as well.  It downloads the installers, the signature/hash files, imports public keys, installs dependencies for multibit, electrum, armory, bitcoin-qt and truecrypt.  btcLiveTools:
