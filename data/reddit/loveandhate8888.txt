Apple credit card makes a terrible vehicle for storing value i.e. saving your money and saving it for a rainy day or retirement.
But at least "muh" shopping is covered! Seems like most people already know how to spend their money, not much out there to encourage good old fashioned Prudence

So does timing though. If people held Bitcoin like people do traditional assets (say over a span of 5 or more years) instead of losing their shit over a 1 year bear-market then they would realise that Bitcoin so far has proven fruitful for many.

But there is also probably a lot that can never be accounted for due to ultra top-secret "black operations". You have to always take into consideration the information that never gets leaked, that never gets announced, that never touches light.

I agree. However savings is also very important too. You can't start a business very easily with $5 to your name but if you saved $100,000 you would be able to convert those savings into something productive. You need a base in which to build something from. You need that "stored energy" as Mike Maloney puts it. 
Which is why the banks hate Bitcoin as a Store of Value (SOV) because they want the muppets powerless and weak. Unable to build anything.
