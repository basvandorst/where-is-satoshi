A trillion before midnight tonight then.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:45:42
2 billion if you don’t check the prices.

Son I have no clue what your talking about. I made no statements about bitcoin in any of my arguments. I just refuted the USD made out think air myth.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:51:17
Why I’m still holding on to my Enron shares.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:52:01
We kinda need a counter balance to all the articles saying bitcoin will be worth a billion by the end of the month.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:53:04
Exactly "no gold and silver backing", that quote was made when we moved away from precious metals and into the faith and credit (in other words the backing) of the US government. And who do you think backs the government? The people and corps of the US through taxes, the resources of the land and the our giant ass military. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:34:19
It’s called a exaggerations dumbass. How the fuck do you honestly think a single bitcoin can be worth a billion by EOD tomorrow?
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:29:29
Why does this USD out of thin air myth keep getting repeated here? The USD is backed by the resources of the US, it's economy, land, people...
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:50:48
Indeed it is, as I said to the other bloke I never said it wasn't. All I said was your USD out of thin air argument is bullshit.

I'm a expert and fully expect bitcoin to hit 1000000 by year end. ^Full disclosure I bought in at 16000 and need to unload.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:29:06
Fair enough.

To all the people who are thinking of buying right now **HODL**. You can get 90% off on boxing day.
And also don't try to catch a falling knife is a old and wise investing strategy.

Kind of like my last trip to Vegas, keep doubling down baby.

I'm at a lost at how stupid some of these posts can be. 
First of all, Executives sell stock to diversify their holdings every year, Tim Cook for example sold off 43 million around the same time last year.
Secondly, sell of stocks in this amount by executives are almost always filed with the SEC beforehand and are done on a schedule to avoid being accused of insider trading, hence the dates.

"Brian Kelly, an outspoken bitcoin uberbull, told CNBC on Monday that he has nearly all of his money invested in cryptocurrencies.". I think maybe he has other motives, like not watching his investment blast off to the core of the Earth.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:25:16
Bitcoin was pumped and dumped. It reach 20k in two months and fell 70% over the next few. 
Edit 12k should have been 20k.

To a right wing American maybe but to a normal person no, Norway is not a socialist country. Norway has strong capitalist institutions and a very open free market system. Having said that Norway also has strong labor laws and extensive welfare programs. At best you can say Norway is a capitalist system with some socialist elements.
Hell you can just google it and they'll be hundreds of articles explaining what Norway is doing.
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:18:05
You shouldn't, he is completely wrong about the dates. First off all, you can only report a loss for 2017 if the trade happened in 2017. Reporting any loss now would go on the 2018 tax year, this is true for most of the world. 
Secondly, corporations have the ability to set their own tax year, mine for example is from Sept to Sept, meaning there is no universal date/month for when corporations do selloffs. Company A may be in May, Company B in Sept.
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:56:21
So basically they want to control Bitcoin. Fuck them, Bitcoin would be better off without these dipshits.
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:49:48
So, I guess these same bull run articles are going to get posted every time we break 10k now?

Who is this guy and why should anybody listen to him?

Half of the altcoins and ICOs have failed, Bitcoin has lost 70% of its value from the ATH. If this is not super risky then I don't know what is.

What fun is that, if bitcoin is not 38K by March you have to eat  a shoe.

The DOW tanking in JAN had nothing to do with Bitcoin, yet Bitcoin tanked along with it. Markets are tied to the people who invest in it and in this case, if tether which has a direct connection to Bitcoin, blows up it will affect all Crypto because of the people.

Not the way corporations operate. If a company goes under, enough is liquidated to cover liabilities and what not. Good example would be NCIX right now in Canada, if person A bought a processor, they would not get a processor back during the liquidation process even if NCIX had it in stock, everything would be liquidated and you would get the value of the processor at the time of purchase in cash back.
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:32:18
What are you smoking? Cause I want some. They were able to report it because it fell so much, you can’t report a dip that didn’t happened.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:52:45
Well you were right for all of 2 hours. Down we go again.
@_date: 2018-02-22 01:35:38
Yea, are you always such a cunt when you lose? Edit, I should rephrase, are you always a sore loser?
Edit x2. You know what, I was wrong this is too retarded even for me. Congrats, you win, Bitcoin blew up and is now quite literally at the Moon. Thank you for your service, I bought and now am Bill Gates rich. Thank you.

Venezuela oil is complete garbage, takes way too much money and time to process (due to the high impurities) and Venezuela's oil infrastructure has been in disrepair for years now meaning its harder to move (which funny enough is exacerbated by the oil, works the equipment harder, needs to be diluted...). The Arab oil producing nations are the big ones that matter, they produce sweet crude which requires little in the way of purification and can be moved easily.
We are also still in a oil glut, meaning Venezuela has to sell there oil for a fraction of a fraction of the price while the rest of the world is moving faster and faster towards renewables.
TL:DR, nothing will happen cause Venezuela oil is shit and no one is willing to pay a fraction of what Venezuela really wants or needs.

Monday is a US stat holiday, banks will be closed. **Assuming** bonuses (which is fucking weird cause normal corps pay bonuses usually on the same date as a payday, which assuming is every second week, would be the 23rd)/red envelopes are deposited tomorrow you would have to wait a 1-3 business days for the transfer to go to whatever exchange (debit instant transfers no longer work). You are looking at at least Wednesday-Thurs for shit to shoot to the moon.

Bitfenix/tether promised scheduled audits to show they have the cash they said they had. Now they saying they can't do that. I mean, it's not FUD if it's fact.

Banks are closed until the 21st, how the hell am I going to deposit the cash or transfer until then. FFS this sub sometimes.

I was talking about China, basically the only reason why I bought up the 21st. Learn to apply context.
And yes, stat holidays do delay direct deposit or is that something you don't know?

They can take all the time they want, it's just going to cause more volitility and speculation the longer they drag this out. If they want to stop the FUD, then they need to show that they are actively trying, servering ties with Friedman with a generic we can't do this message did not help them. 
Back to your initial point, Bitfenix failed to complete a audit they promised and all they showed today was that they had a Corp bank account with ING, which amounts to nothing of significance, I can start a C-Corp and open Corp bank account today for less than $500. This brings me back to my point, Bitfenix can take however long they want, but public sentiment is not going to hodl forever, volitility and fear will set in the longer they take.

If you had said use credit from a credit card or a personal loan to play with a speculative assets I would have called you dumb. But to use money from a school loan, a loan that cannot be discharged and will follow you to death is one of the stupidest things I’ve heard from this sub. There are moronic ideals and then there is this, so stupid that I am at a loss of words.
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:37:47
I don’t see your point with this article. They had to burned/get rid of the damaged and unusable notes in the first place, being able to electricity from it was a nice bonus. Not because fiat was worth less than crypto.
