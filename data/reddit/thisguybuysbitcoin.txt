Note that while it is true the transaction fees are much lower and it is super easy to send bitcoin half way across the world at minimum cost, there are a couple of risks you need to know esp when you are new:
1. Converting from fiat to btc will involve some charges in conversion. This is similar to converting USD to CAD. And some charges in converting back.
1. Price volatility - 1$ in btc may be 1.25$ or 0.75$ tomorrow. This needs to be factored into your calculations if you are working with large amounts
This is not to scare you, but a fact. I'm pretty new to it as well and am loving it so far :). Welcome to the rabbit hole!

Actually that's a very good point. What happens if we have 21m bitcoins and half of those are out of circulation (lost, unknown)? Can the protocol be modified to produce more bitcoins?

Um get a job? Build a service/tool/skills and work for it? Buy bitcoin with the money you earn? 
Sorry but faucets will not afford you a living. They give the impression that there are bitcoins up for grabs, but it's less than the pennies in jars I kept at the cashier in stores. Honestly I believe you could walk from store to store, pick up one penny from each store and make more money in less time than a faucet. To make any worthwhile money from a faucet you need to work on at least a 100 of them consistently.
