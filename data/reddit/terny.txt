Ive been subscribed to this sub since pre-$200 (2012-13?). At the time it was being coopted by people thinking theyd become rich. Now theres is no discussion around the tech, only about making money.

As a taringa user, it's absolutely nothing like facebook. Taringa is what happens when a general forum explodes in content.

Can I finally buy bitcoin? I've been subbed here for quite a while now (years) yet own 0 bitcoins. I love the mechanism and the idealism, but I fucking hate people using it as an investment and thinking they're gonna get rich. I want to use it as a currency and if the price becomes stable then that's when I'll get in.

This video has made me want to understand the blockchain better. Should I start with the Bitcoin Whitepaper? My background: Systems Engineer student, with lots programming experience but only knowledge of crypto is the basics (from a youtube series which I forget the name of).

What do Math PhDs with programming knowledge end up doing?

It's exactly this. Sponsoring hackathons will not have the same effect in the public mind as sponsoring a UFC fighter. Chances are that people that are into hackathons already know bitcoin. Sponsoring a UFC fighter will make my neighbors become more aware.

That last bit made me a bit sad.

All those people buying bitcoin to become millionaires instead of using it are fucking up.

Teach someone how to do it and pay them by the hour a reasonable amount (I don't live in the US, so I wouldn't know how much), then rake in the money without the effort. Next step: get two people. something something profit.
