I actually somehow set up three (?) accounts. I'm ridiculous  I know. It looks like I now have all of my btc consolidated to .0089 btc in a blockchain wallet.

I agree with you about bitcoin being too speculative, I just think it would be a good alternative to the $5 bill in a card from grandpa that will buy her a candy bar or some other small disposable trinket that she would never think about 6 hours after receiving it.

Time to do more research. Thanks for the leads.

That's awesome sir but someone in the original thread tipped me and that's what got me started thinking about this. I REALLY appreciate it and you are an awesome person but please nobody else in the post tip me for asking a question. It's appreciated but before anyone else would try to tip me they should look at friends and family who may need help and you'd be surprised how much even tiny symbolic am mounts can actually help. 
I'm having problems verbalizing for some reason. 
1.) this was awesome of you and is appreciated. 
2.) I'm not in here to troll for tips. 
3.) There's almost always someone more deserving and/or in your life.

The problem with pooling is that I want them to be able to individually gift the account a few dollars here an there when holidays etc come along. 
Checking localbitcoins now. Thank you.
