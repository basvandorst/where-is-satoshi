Seconded. I can only troll my friends with steam voucher codes for so long! :(

I'm impressed that you only managed to spell 'but', and technically 'hodl' correctly.

It wasn't funny.
Should probably reconsider that username... 
@_date: 2018-05-05 15:44:58
That was a really odd way of phrasing that. I like it.

Which is why it's a hot wallet with just a couple of hundred dollars on it... And not your entire stash, unlike using the trezor out in public.

It depends if a flip from fiat to crypto happens quickly enough. People wouldn't want to sell for fiat and would prefer to trade in crypto in that instance.

It's backed by mathematics and can't be massively inflated when Donald fucks up the economy.
@_date: 2018-05-07 22:46:11
I have a $6 wrench (thanks inflation!) and the ability to look over your shoulder.
That's why not. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 08:40:33
Sure. But then what's the point?
The entire point is to store 1000s on there which you'd be *really* upset over using. At least that's how I see it. 
If I'm going out to spend a little bitcoin, then I'll just move it to the hot wallet before I leave. Moving it from one trezor to another just seems like a waste of time and seriously inconvenient when it comes to actually using it.

Oh look. Yet another phishing scam on a Google ad. 
Its 2018. **Run an adblocker.**
It's not even a ethical or philosophical choice anymore. The industry has had well over a decade to clean up its act and it shows no sign of doing so. The writing is on the wall: as long as they are getting paid, nothing else matters. Including your privacy, security, personal information. Nothing.
They get paid. You get screwed and to hell with everything else. It's that simple. 
Run an adblocker.

This is a joke, right? If you guys fuck up and I'm entitled to my winnings but don't get them, I expect my winnings, not some "sucks to be you, read the TOS sucka!" response.

I was a main net virgin until last week.
The experience is very similar to test net versions. More refined ui and that's about it.
Oh, and you can actually buy stuff now! Although not much stuff. Still early days, frustratingly. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:24:22


That's okay, I doubt you get invited into many people's homes...

Does that make us the witness data?

The market has nothing to do with your lack of basic manners and curtsey online, and it has everything to do with you being a dick.

Segwit was a bug fix. Nothing more. A compromise was made to allow it to also be a block size increase. Segwit was absolutely not a 'fix' to high fees. 
LN is the fix that Segwit enables. It's still in early stages. I've used it a bit over the past week and it's genuinely awesome. Fees of less than a cent, genuinely instant transactions, and I didn't have to care about how congested the network is once my channel was set up.


Please don't spread fud. You don't know if this spike will continue or will disappear in a couple of days like it did last time. Neither do I.
I get it's frustrating, but genuinely awesome improvements are coming, and are available now if you're brave enough and can spend money with other brave vendors. Being patient isn't easy, but *money is being replaced here*. Don't expect a smooth journey on the way to awesome.

I'm very much looking forward to the mental gymnastics that will be required to 'debunk' this.

I like bitstamp. Took a while to get verified but fine after that. I image being verified would be a quicker process now.

Almost. The bitcoin network itself will do the confirmation. You can look up the address you've given out on a block chain explorer and see the latest payments that have gone to it. The ledger app will spot any payments once you reconnect everything but bitcoin will continue to work regardless of you being around to see it.
Be aware the ledger may empty the address you give out if you spend from it. Don't be alarmed, this is normal and anyone with the address will still be able to send you bitcoin. You'll always get a new receiving address every time you ask for one as well if the old one has been used. Again, normal. 
If you chose to manage your ledger with the electrum wallet (be sure not to download a malicious version) then electrum can export a **public** key. You can scan this into the 'Sentinel' app on android and keep a tab on things on your phone. You can even issue new receiving addresses with this.
Keep your 24 word list nice and safe and offline.

Evidently, This isn't at all how it works or why the US government is creating thin money out of fresh air.
Just think of it this way: Who gets the 'new money'? Do you get a portion of it in your paycheck, or does it go to someone else?
As usual, follow the money, and you'll find the corruption.
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:54:58


uhh... No. Do we really need to have bullshit clickbait headlines in here, OP? You didn't even copy the headline from the source so you can't even claim that as a defense.
**One** bank in the UK utterly screwed up a migration to different systems. They were part of a larger bank and until now have been renting the infrastructure for roughly £100m per year from the 'parent' bank they split from. So they were keen to make savings by running it themselves on their own systems. A perfectly reasonable course of action.
What caused this to be newsworthy is the utter farce in the execution of the migration. It was rushed, not properly planned, and was generally a bit of a joke with last minute patches mere hours before switch on time. The new system simply didn't cope and nobody can access anything. Now they have drafted in IBM engineers who have to try and clean up this mess. I do not envy those guys.
**No other banks are affected by this**, just this **one**, who screwed up and will be paying dearly for the consequences of this for a long time to come in lost custom and inquires and the like.
It wouldn't surprise me if they ended up failing due to this in the long run. TSB is absolutely not 'too big to fail' and I could see them being purchased by a competitor for something stupid like £1 to keep them going under after all their customers migrate away. It might happen, it might not.
The real losers here are, as always, will be the bank's customers (however temporary that may be, until the FSCS step in in the worse case), and the bank's staff who rely on them for an income.
There are plenty of reasons to hate the banking sector in general. This is not one of them. It was a mistake by one bank, and they will pay for it, one way or another.

I unsubbed from years ago (yes, this is a new account) for this kind of bullshit.

Yes. That bullshit term in your TOS is strange to me. Alongside your curious response which completely ignored the point I making. Funny that.

Great way to doxx yourself with this obvious scam there, Keith.

Testnet?! That's **so** March 2018!
In all seriousness. Good luck with this. Worse case it'll be a hell of a learning experience, and hopefully a fair bit of fun.

There was no paranoia at all. According to your own website if some 'technical issue' arose and somehow I didn't get a payout, I had to somehow just live with it. I raised a perfectly reasonable complaint.
And if you want polite responses you shouldn't be asking passive aggressive questions towards potential customers whilst also completely ignoring the very valid concern raised. Just a thought.
You've successfully removed me from your potential customer pool. And I also presume a few others reading this thread.
