Don't worry. The ass-clowns in the Senate will figure out some shady-ass way to renew that dreadful law. They'll probably add it as a rider to some emergency defense spending bill. Remember, it was overwhelmingly approved in the House, and Obama wants it renewed too. How often do Republicans and Obama agree?

What a terrible nearly useless mobile site. It's all widgets and bullshit with no content. Can anyone link to the article text?

I've read there's an upper limit and one it's reached no more bitcoins will be mined. Is this true? If so, how would it be enforced?

For one, they're great at bouncing. Also, you can throw them and a dog may or may not bring it back. Try to do that with a box.

But what's to stop someone from forking that code, and inserting a malicious node into the network that doesn't follow the rules?

"families of the victims who overdosed on drugs"?
What kind of bullshit non sequitur is that? Did he also force feed people drugs?

Or...maybe Reddit should just be a news aggregation site? Trying to be Yelp+OkCupid+Mint+Uber+Facebook all in one would only result in them doing all those things poorly and wasting millions in the process.
Digg tried reinventing itself in order to grow and it imploded. Reddit should stick to what it does best.

No, this just encourages more corrupt police behavior. This scumbag cop this because he thought he'd get away with it. Don't make him right.
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:55:18
I think I see the problem. You're treating Reddit like a  replacement for in person interaction. That's just not how people work. You're not going to have the same emotional response to words on a screen as to a face to face encounter. This site should be treated like a supplement to everyday life, not as your sole sense of community.
Oh, and the site you described is called meetup.com. It would be a disaster if Reddit turned into that.

Don't be naive. Laws are for peasants like you and me. Not the literal royalty in the British government.
@_date: 2015-07-22 05:40:04
US Bitcoin exchanges need to be licensed by the government? Doesn't that somewhat defeat the purpose of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-20 22:46:22
That's not right. OP is correct, you normally *want* to run `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade` since it does [some extra dependency cleanups and upgrades](
I think you're confusing that with `do-release-upgrade`, which does potentially makes a lot of damaging changes.
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:18:07
Excellent. I'll message $500 worth of coin bits to you immediately.
@_date: 2015-07-22 20:12:18
No they don't need to be licensed or no that doesn't defeat the purpose of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:21:07
Exactly. If a Zune screams out anything, it's "there's nothing valuable here."
@_date: 2015-07-20 22:49:04
Yeah, but do you have Tux-Racer? I didn't think s...oh wait, you do. Nevermind.
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:25:08
Yeah, but those first three have legitimate non-scary meanings behind them that have been co-opted by their detractors into a slur. "Terrorist" has no positive connotations.
A better analogy might be a word "Islamist". Technically, it just means someone who practices Islam, but in modern times it's come to mean someone who blows up churches, beheads cartoonists and shoots little girls in the face.

Yeah, this is kind of a deal breaker. Due to its decentralized nature, I can understand not being able to enforce a unique username per user, but not even within the same web-browser? Why even have a moniker at all if it's just going to be randomly set on each page?
@_date: 2015-07-04 00:28:19
As a Redditor, my impression of it so far:
* open source
* decentralized
* accessible as a website (as opposed to Aether or Wechat or other platforms that require a separate download)
* Aesthetics could use some work. Whoever thought yellow-on-white was a good color scheme needs to have a talking to. It's painful to look at.
* No persistent usernames, not even in the same browser. Opening a new tab gave me a new random "moniker".
* No way to control what "playlists" are shown on your homepage. This makes it feel more like Twitter hashtags, but without the ability to follow anyone.
* No way to control content within a playlist. Maybe this is by design, but even with this Reddit nonsense and douchy moderators, I still like the idea that someone has the *option* to curate and censor content within a sub. The balance is that users are free to unsubscribe and/or create their own sub at any time. This allows Reddit to be as noisy as Twitter or as orderly as Y-combinator depending on the moderator and user preference. With Frizbee, on one has that choice.

Is it true I can make my own bitcoin by taking coins and smashing them into tiny bits? If so, for smashing, should I use a block attached to the end of a chain?
@_date: 2015-07-20 22:50:59
This is why I only store Bitcoin on my Zune.

I read he did get out, but then the new owners sold it back to him?
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:24:24
I don't think some of those are correct. For example, China extradites, at least in some situations. They almost extradited Snowden from Hong Kong but declined the initial submission because the paperwork "was not in order", allowing him to board the flight to Russia.

Why hasn't anyone setup "terrorist free zones"? Think of the children!
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:58:43
This is the only reasonable course of action.
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:47:03
Yeah, it sucks, but the lock was probably some dumb automated process that looks for certain patterns and flags them for review. I doubt anyone looked at your account and said, "Hmm, probably a terrorist, better ask him what his favorite color is".
I had my traditional account locked once because I took a plane trip to a different coast and bought lunch. The "system" thought I was on the other coast and assumed someone had stolen my info.
