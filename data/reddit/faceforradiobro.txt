I started off 150 per week in July last year. I’ve learnt all the lessons the hard way. To get to where I am now I researched the shit outta stuff. I got Tron at 2c and flicked them at 30c (NZD). Stellar I got in at 5c and flicked for 1$. Power Ledger i got right after ico at 9c and sold for 1.10. Just gotta find company’s that arnt being spoken about. Adverx is one you will hear about this year yet they have done no marketing - ico is still open. High performance blockchain is another one you’ll hear about this year making it into the top 10 - 15. Research research research. And try not to listen to too many people on the internet. Always follow up what people post that may be of interest to you

High Performance Blockchain
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:09:15
I am 95% alt coins. My recommendations are (in no importance) Stellar, Power Ledger, DeepbrainChain, Neo, Icon, High Performance Blockchain. 
I also have funds in an ICO called Adverx which should 15x easily. 
I have a high risk high growth approach. I have one mission and it’s to get a house for my family. I’ve already used crypto to buy two cars and pay for a wedding. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:37:11
Some successful investor friends told me about it. They arnt marketing it which is good in my opinion. 7.5mill total circulation of coins. Check it out.

Also note, that the Wall Street junkies are smart. They know meteoric rises equally need corrections. Hence I wouldn’t be too surprised if majority short it down to 8k

@_date: 2017-12-10 08:19:28
I believe we will see it dip below 8k. It went from 7k to 19k in a matter of days. Bitcoin has always consolidated all the way up to 5k, but nothing since. It’s overdue and will be very healthy. Just my opinion. My buy orders are set in around that mark.

Calm down mate. Every time this happens we go back down to 3600. Chill. Let as many people accumulate as possible and then, then it will glide up.

Thats spot on, just keep buying chunks when you can and build up a nice amount over TIME. If the price continues to increase, which i dont see why it wont, you'll be thanking yourself in 5 years
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:28:33
If you have any knowledge of stocks or forex trading you will understand that after a huge rush or "spike" of buys or sells it will always "correct" and go the opposite way. Nobody can tell you when this event will happen but it will happen, unfortunately prices don't keep rising forever as people "sell off" after profits have been made. 
That being said, there are some indicators you can use to "hint" that a reversal maybe coming. 
This is not financial advice you must make your own choices. 
The indicators I have used in forex and stocks is after a large rally (which we have had) when volume starts dropping and the price keeps climbing there is a good chance it may reverse. Combined with other indicators too. That being said I am not a financial advisor or an expert trader so take this with a pinch of salt. 
YouTube is full of useful educational videos. 
Hope this helps , i now see it's below 4000! It should reside between 3500 - 3800. However on the charts it's hit support of 2000 twice so at the worst it could head there again. You just need to decide what your investment goals are, short term or long. Mine are long. I'm not fussed about dips. I buy amounts every week regardless of price. 
Remember, markets always recover! 
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:02:59
Care to explain? Im seeing both, im seeing a correction taking place and im also seeing strong buy signals.. Im am HODLing right now, waiting to buy more

@_date: 2017-08-15 03:46:21
It could be either. Ive witnessed corrections that last weeks, each day it drops lower and lower... or it could be a big sharp dump that triggers stop losses that auto sells which then trips other stop losses below that... Its hard to tell. Just be prepared for it, and remember markets always recover :)

When you treat people like that, they just do it behind your back and waste time anyway. You lose more production being an asshole by having rigid “rules”. 
Where I work, we’re allowed on our phones and computers whenever we want for whatever and we always hit our deadlines. Because we feel appreciated and not treated as children we work harder.

Feels like it. We must be close to a bottom 
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:16:33
Until the big red dildo happens. This pattern has been happening all year. Shorts get high, bitcoin pumps and big boys make money. Repeat. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 05:06:08
What stage are we in now? I’m feeling like this. “Fuck it’s dead” - does that mean we are nearly on bottom ? 
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:31:27
Your sacrifice is greatly appreciated 
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:28:53

@_date: 2018-12-06 04:31:59
But in all honesty, I can’t see a bottom lol just keeps going lower and lower. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 05:12:52
