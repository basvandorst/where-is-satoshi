Lloyds are absolutely fine. When I first bought in they blocked my card. Rang them up, and in all fairness they undid the block instantly. Apparently spending £500, £250 and £250 on Bitcoin within a couple of days looks suspicious. I can totally see why. But they were really helpful and now I'm all good to spend away ��

I've always done my transfers via Revolut which has been a pain. Not due to the service just the wait times and limits. Those purchases were when I was new to Bitcoin so just put them on my card. Looking back I paid a fortune in fees.

It's so stressful and hard work, definitely not fun. HODL team

If it drops under $1 buy in! It can't get much worse at that point ��

Also, I've checked the GDAX status and it shows that there's a degraded service including the SEMA transfers

Ahh shit! That's such a pain. Oh well, at least we know where we're at. Thanks dude, appreciate the updates and you've saved me many hours with support too. What's your plan then, wait for the £10k crash?

That's absolutely right. I contacted their support and they said because the weekend aren't working days they class it as if we'd sent the transfer Monday. Bit annoying really

I'm the exact same! Spoke to their CS and told me the same story. Said it could be today but probably tomorrow. Let's hope we luck out for a big dip for this weekend ��

Well shit

Well, I'm Sat here watching this price rocket to 9500~ wishing I'd have put money in a £1000 ago when I I submitted this transfer. Oh the joys of bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:10:44
I'm tempted too, going to probably buy via card if they don't have my money before the £10k crash.
And that would be brilliant for revolut to offer bitcoin ��

Oh well, bought in around $10k, Hodl right

Why didn't you tell me this 24 hours ago ��

Revolut recently opened their crypto section to me. It's the exact same. You can buy crypto, but can't take it out of revolut to your own wallet. Why on earth would I use that, or Robin Hood
