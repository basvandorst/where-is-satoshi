If you are totally non technical it can be hard to figure out who to listen to in the field, Andreas Antonopoulos is very popular for laypeople as he can speak in an easily digestible and interesting way, If you want the opinion of a 'bitcoin scientist' look at people who have been in the field innovating longer than Bitcoin has even been around, people like Nick Szabo, Bram Cohen, Adam Back and all the other cypherpunk legends.

Censorship resistance is the *only* reason I got into Bitcoin in the first place, without that its totally uninteresting


When blocks are larger the orphan risk for geographically diverse miners increases exponentially, too many miners are already working behind a firewall in *the peoples republic*, the system is no where near decentralized enough as is
Its weird people will argue for larger block sizes all day but they understand we can't half the block time suddenly, both are tied to critical system operations and have effects beyond the obvious

You seem nice so Ill take a little time to answer back again.


My point is that if the difficulty is '10', and was '1' last year, next year it might be closer to '100' and not '20'. If your calculators account for that, great, but I doubt thats in any way profitable over time.


If the difficulty doubles with the price your payout is half what it was and you own less bitcoin than when you started... you would only be profitable in USD.


No offense but I can tell its new for you. My advice- Its very stressful to be smarter than other people, being dumb is easy. Smart people have to put risk into their profits because they need to outpace everyone else. Dumb people just take the easy profits on the table. Hodl, build wealth and sleep easy at night.

Totally agree, I just don't find it a huge risk on the main chain because the miners won't mine another chain for free, the power of greed overcomes the temptation to 51%, I won't argue mining isn't dangerously centralized currently though, another reason to not raise the blocksize which further's the divide between large and small miners (and don't get me started on what that also means regarding more validationless mining)


You would have coins on both chains, there isn't anything to lose except possibly through inaction, the vacuum of mine-able profit would prevent the hashrate from centralizing to the less valuable chain, I think someone once said 'vacuums are abhorrent in nature' regarding physics and this is the same thing, if Bitmain is shrugging off profit someone else will mine it


I disagree with the framing here, 'the people' had nothing to do with NYA. By raising the blocksize prematurely we further centralize mining, let big business know they can create agreements on behalf of customers without consultation and set development back by months as we have to reconfigure things like the FIBRE network to new specs. It's basically a slap in the face to the scientific method, changes must be made slowly and cautiously to fully understand their effects.
That said I will drop Core in a second if I disagree with a change or even the BIP process through which change is approved (which I find completely fair currently), I have no allegiance to them and neither should anyone else


My philosophy is aligned with Satoshi's, only 1 recursive step deeper, the chain with the most POW is also the chain with the most extractable value, POW is just a great lagging indicator of said value

I should also note, I don't think I'm going to give you a fully satisfactory answer regarding 51% attacks, Bitmain has a monopoly on chips and thats for 1x, BCH, 2x or any other coin using SHA256 currently. There is no doubt investing in Bitcoin has risks, we even had single pools at almost 50% hashrate a few years ago. It's just something the community will need to weather until the ecosystem attracts a wide variety of geographically diverse competitors ( [hopefully it won't be much longer] ( )

A)the whitepaper doesn't have a distinction between nodes and miners, nor is it fully representative of today's network topology

That's kinda extreme, I don't want to destroy Bitcoin.
That is an extreme statement and I don't believe you do
There is fringe to every side in this debate though, I had an S2x'r telling me to 'suck on it until november troll' just a couple weeks ago in an S2x r/btc thread, much less any of the other stuff that is said there (how many are actual S2x'rs or just against core is harder to determine)
But we shouldn't let rhetoric dictate a debate of technical grounds , just as I don't let fox news or msnbc dictate to me the political frameworks of their respective parties. Heck there are a couple people in r/btc I've seen make some decent points about larger blocks. We should gather as much info as possible and try to logically arrive to a conclusion instead of going by feel or saying 'fuck it just compromise' (which can just as easily be the worst of both worlds)

Right, but it *does* matter how many people are using each chain (which are *very roughly* represented by nodes, and even though they can be sibyl'd to misrepresent the true count, you can't sibyl value), and if more people are using Chain A, more value can be mined from Chain A, more hashrate will secure Chain A, Chain A is thus Bitcoin and Chain B is something else because those users have a different ruleset than the majority of users


Easy way to calculate is with percentages, 50% hashpower means 50% of blocks mined or 1 every 2


It would be irrational to 51% the chain with more value
A.the miner would be forcing a POW change, invalidating his investments into the valuable chain
B. the profit would be extremely small compared to those investments, you could reverse maybe a few hundred thousand to one or more exchanges without some automated process stopping you, but the equipment cost would be in the millions or 10's of millions *at least*
C. the slowdown makes the valued chain *more* profitable to mine and not less, people will pay higher and higher transaction fees in relation to the amount of uncertainty 
D. Bitmain is a business and will abandon a losing proposition once its untenable, for example it seems they have already started winding BCH down IMO, the pumps are getting smaller and smaller as less value can be inflated out
And after all this if a miner acts irrationally anyway and a POW change happens the network could possibly just pick things up from the last 'good' block, though I'm honestly not sure exactly how it would all play out at that point, but it would be a great day to own a decent GPU

Your right, that is a deep discussion, I'd say it has value because people can accept it knowing it will be accepted somewhere else later for about the same or more value, again no matter how many splits whichever chain has the most users will attract the most hashes in a vacuum like fashion


When you 51% your basically rolling the blocks back, the attack would likely have a target such as an exchange where the miner would deposit, withdraw a different form of value then 51% (reversing the deposit) for the goal of profit, I mean you could 51% to just discredit a chain but when it comes to ultimate profit a miner would have little reason to play sides (which is why BCH still exists), if your framing the goal as destroying BTC with no regard to profit you can ignore that point


People will pay 100,000 per transaction if their 10 million is in possible danger and they want to keep it on an exchange just in case,  the inflation subsidy is also becoming less of each blocks total value every halving, they are currently around [.5 to 2 Bitcoin per block during normal current operation](
with 12.5 in inflation reward
It's also important to remember someone has to buy the coins mined from Chain B which has less people using it, so the value of that coin is lower almost by definition (especially if the users of Chain A start dumping)


I think everyone acts rationally given their perceived inputs but thats another deep discussion. Personally if Bitcoin failed (by the rules I am validating) I would sooner quit crypto entirely than accept a paypal 2.0 type coin or any ruleset I don't agree with, but thats just me, and if the majority of users think like me then it likely won't fail


Yeah I doubt we could get a voluntary switch from everyone at this point, I am hoping Moore's law hits its limit on SHA Asics soon, at least that would help the manufacturing centralization


50% 20 minute blocks, 1 month retarget
25% 40 minute blocks, 2 month retarget
12.5% 1 hour 20 minute blocks, 4 month retarget
6.25 % 2 hour 40 minute blocks, 8 month retaget
Even a 1 month re target is death sentence in crypto time.
1 month of 20 minute blocks is hardly a death sentence, I think we just have a disagreement on durability here, fast transactions are not Bitcoin's strong suite, Visa is faster, cheaper for users (reward points are basically negative transaction fees), and much more noob friendly, Bitcoin's strengths (on Layer 1) rely on different metrics such as censorship resistance and financial sovereignty IMO, as long as those aren't broken the value will hold during low hashrate periods (as we see it even increased the past couple months while BCH has stolen large amounts of hashing and caused similar issues for short periods)
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:33:13


Woops, so it was, my bad


nodes represent the rules an individual validates with, the tightest rule set of the majority of individuals is Bitcoin (at least it's the definition I have been mulling with)


something to think about, if 85% of the hashrate goes away the network will still find roughly 1 block every 6 or 7 (once an hour average), inconvenient but enough to have it limp along to normal adjustment, the added fee pressure also helps attract back miners


this is in fact my argument here, miners *need* the value users inject to pay for the expensive POW process, nice summation

Yes, the CS definition is: 'denoting or relating to computer networks in which **each computer can act as a server for the others, allowing shared access to files and peripherals without the need for a central server.'**
They would say 'satoshi did not design it that way'/'no one is working on true SPV from the old vanguard to make it happen'
We then say 'the white paper is not holy text'/'SPV does not exist as satoshi envisioned because it involves hard CS problems and would not save you from fraud or protect autonomy as it is currently'
Usually then it devolves into consumer level pseudo-science debates or someone smart will chime in then be dragged into 'but pseudo-science says this' by the opposing side

People have been saying this since I joined in 2011, either the free market is wrong or, just maybe, you are valuing Bitcoin by different metrics than what makes it actually successful?
The Visa blockchain for instance has more infrastructure, instant 0 conf transactions, and negative transaction fees (via rewards), maybe try just using that if those are the metrics you value?
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:36:02
He's not wrong (mostly). The value proposition of Bitcoin (L1) is mainly the censorship resistance and financial sovereignty, looking objectively transactions are slow (10 minutes +), expensive compared to incumbents on the consumer side (Visa gives me reward points) and confusingly unforgiving (no reversals, no help desk or hotline, can be hard for an average consumer to keep a private key safe). Worst of all is the scaling limit on L1, at a certain point in L1 scaling becomes too centralized and loses the censorship resistance aspect. Given all this I see Bitcoin today as a long term bet on L2 solutions, if L2 can address some of those points Bitcoin could be limitless. If it cannot though we will be stuck around this price range (maybe a bit more or less) and Bitcoin/crypto will be relegated to regulatory arbitrage for gamblers, darknet, hookers etc without real mainstream utility, efficiency or acceptance. 
For the record I'm heavily invested in Bitcoin and believe L2 will come to successful fruition in some form, I am just playing devils advocate as people should objectively look at their investment risk and not assume Bitcoin is a sure thing

unless you are saying the economic majority want the status quo I don't see how "ebliever"s statement is 'retarded', miners or the user base can activate forks, if the people using the system agree it will pass because of the value in the system attracting security


a 50% increase in demand =/= a 50% rise in fees once the cap is hit, fees grow based on the relative need of the users in a limited supply environment
simple thought- if 1mb block has 1-2$ fees when full, but fees were only 30-40 cents last year when there was some room, do you think the miners want a 3/4 full block at 2mb?

because they are incentivized economically to have full blocks and high fees, when it makes more sense profit wise they will switch to a larger block in some form, the hard limit is a nice excuse to shift blame, miners also can't set their min fee arbitrarily high because competition

"they" aren't trying to get everyone on board a single plan though, they are signalling 3 different scaling plans and status quo, maybe if they show unity in scaling (all signalling the same plan) they wouldnt have an excuse to blame Core anymore and would lose revenue from fees, so why do that?

Smart contracts are the albatross dragging ETH down, they hold a disproportional cost to the system and user. See Prism for example, the cost of running a Dapp versus running a website is inordinate, so the fees are ridiculous. Blockchains are very inefficient in computing.
Another problem with several of your examples like Airbnb or Uber, is that people want to have those middlemen, they aggregate reputation and are liable (financially) if something goes wrong. Sometimes middlemen provide an advantage economically by competing to see who can give you the most reliable, cheapest service.
The final point Ill make, the flashy bells and whistles don't make a strong blockchain, POS, turing completeness, etc are minor compared to boring but important things like immutability and a high level a resistance to change
Now you sound pretty new so Ill throw a little extra in here. small, cultish communities around a new tech are fun, Bitcoin was full of that wide eyed enthusiasm a few years ago. We may seem salty but most of us are just smarter, we know extra features force higher costs to the system, we also know the crypto boom has brought every snake oil salesman around, many of us have seen every scam twice so we dont get excited when the next salesman comes to town. But don't be afraid to ask questions, Ive seen many of the core devs take time to explain things to users, not every part of the community has delved into trolling :D

I dont mean to be disingenuous, cash and bitcoin are both *pseudo-anonymous* though, your right I'm not going to take the time to trace a specific serial number but its totally possible to watch a bill move around, thats how many bank robbers are caught by the feds and thats how sites like [this]( operate


the point being supply inflation of Au is not predictable and total amount not hard capped


pretty broad comparison, the same can be said of many things, like well known fast food restaurants and popular but aging prostitutes

Cash can also be traded in sub-cent or custom denomination amounts via rounding (much like sub-satoshi lightning routing), is traceable via the individual serial number on physical bills or routing documentation, has a somewhat predictable inflation rate more inline with Bitcoin, and also can be represented digitally (though Ill concede its technically just money and not 'cash' at that point).
the gold supply is near-unlimited (there are [entire asteroids]( and [bacteria that shit gold]( with only the extraction cost equilibrium to prevent oversupply (which is not to say someone can't find an exceedingly large, easy to extract mine tomorrow), Gold also has utility outside of value transfer, mining in gold and bitcoin is similar in name only
To say Bitcoin is more like one than the other makes for an incomplete comparison IMO, Bitcoin is its own thing
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:54:38
Difficulty increases are usually exponential, make sure you are factoring that in; If people could consistently outperform the stock market index with mining contracts everyone would be pouring money into those right now (which funny enough would increase difficulty to bare margin profits, mining is hugely competitive)
Report back if you make a profit at the end though; my guess is its better to just buy and Hodl :P
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:42:26
I use bitcoin for drugs and gambling mostly, so Ill take full 1mb blocks, especially with any space saving improvements such as segwit or schnorr, I personally have no problems paying 10$ per transaction if I get my money's worth in both security and censorship resistance, you see, people want me in **prison** for my transactions, thats why I have to use Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-12 00:16:31
the 1.1B I think you are mentioning is referencing what the govt of kuwait got from UN mandates after the Iraq invasion, Rwanda had 500k-1M deaths according to my quick google, so monetary valuations should include their lost lifetime earnings as well as those injured, property damages and potential income lost from property damages 
Bitcoin market cap is also not 1 to 1 with price so a 2.5 B loss doesn't mean 2.5B has exited and requires much much less to prop the price back up,
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:24:31
I mean between the start and end of the contract, not between retargeting periods-as you can see the hash rate has increased by [an order of magnitude]( in the last year and a half
I'm definitely dumber than the smart people in the room, but chances are you are too. You should post back next year and tell us how much money your sure-fire bet made though

Miners are the most centralized appendage of Bitcoin, 70% of Asics manufactured by one company, past issues with pool sizes etc, and you suggest putting them in control of blocksize which directly impacts the decentralized appendage of our p2p cash, nodes...recipe for disaster and censored transactions, not to mention all the various game theory attacks between miners, they are only as invested as the shelf life/profitability ratio of their products
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:57:18
I mean if you outperform the US stock market (8-9%+ annually)
But if you expect tokens to only increase (and by 100%) you might just be dumber than me (which is saying a lot), my advice is to manage the token yourself and save the 12%, but go ahead give away your money in management fees, don't mind me
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:38:24

because you are arguing about the semantics of a word without an accepted definition, must a blockchain have POW?  is ethereum a blockchain if its not fully immutable? if I put "transaction files" into folders on a shared network PC and sign each with a hash is it a blockchain? are we using satoshi's "block chain" (a tree shaped structure with a genesis block at the root) or are we using someone else's definition?
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:20:43
80% of miners have *stated* support
like the HK or NY agreements, stating is support doesn't mean much apparently
I think classic got around 20% at top height (from memory) when they were doing that, miners obv prefer high fees and profits to raising the blocksize immediately through segwit or straight increase
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:24:51
How do you download a blockchain without someone else's permission? Not all blockchains are immutable, persistent or public by nature, without the POW component blockchain is just database
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:12:18
same thing, you still have to download the client and subsequent chain from other people, database technology has all the features you want, POW relies on large amounts of hashing and meaningful block rewards to not be gamed
unless you mean a token, in which case inefficiencies abound, just use Database/HTTP
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:46:06
I would be interested in your historical data on contracts bought say sometime last year and how profitable they are today, my guess is with difficulty increases you would be lucky to not lose a bunch, nvm profit, contracts just load the risk to noobs while companies skim on old miners, just hodl for gainz
AFAIK in the 6 years in this space I havent seen anyone post hard numbers of profitability or even claim they made profit from a contract
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:33:45
Its a good use case if you dont mind paying 12% a year in fees

Yes your either new or havent been Bitcoining around the space long enough to learn the lessons, people have been making the same arguments since I joined in 2011, DOGE has a better community, this or that coin is trying POS (a legit hard or *impossible* CS problem btw), This coin will be used by that country's government (there are no governments using crypto, ever use Aurora Coin?), this algorithm is better than SHA-256 (Zk-Snarks is not understood well enough to even be considered safe, no one knows for sure it cant be broken now or in the future)...All these features are not free, they carry legit costs to the system and without evaluating those costs you are just cheer leading for whatever's 'new'
The 1 better thing I already said, no one wants money that changes quickly or is mutable, money needs to be slow to change and censorship resistant to **engender trust among the users**, merchants want to accept the same money today they were accepting yesterday as long as they can spend it the same tomorrow. Quick changes also create centralized points of failure, what do you think will happen when Putin asks Vitalik to make Russia friendly changes or chill in the Gulag? 
Here's an exercise, look around the community, what gives Bitcoin *value*? What groups don't want to use crypto but are forced to because of government regulation and why do they consistently choose Bitcoin? These groups create *inelastic demand*, the most important pillar for the price IMO, more so than hodlers or speculators, heres a [NSFW hint]( for one of the many groups in need of BTC *now*.

Like I said in several of my replies, I certainly won't use the service, if scottrade started using 3% closing fees they would be laughed out of business, you seem to think Alts and tokens only go up and you can't buy and hold them yourself without prism, but whatever, like I said have fun with giving your money away, 12% is an OUTSTANDING year for a stock trader, more power to you if you can trivially give away 3% of your portfolio
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:13:57
perhaps, but 8 times higher =/= Visa scale, so we will hit that limit anyway
I won't presume my drug dealers thoughts, but 2$ isn't a big tax in my view compared to the security and network effect (ease of cashing in/out) of Bitcoin, I certainly dont mind paying that little on my end
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:40:06
When blocks were only near full last year people paid 30-40 cents per tx, blocks at totally full people pay 2$+, you do the math

several deals have been met or proposed already, NY, HK, segwit, xt, classic, BU, EC, even BIP 109 and every other *on chain* size increase/tweak has no support (not that segwit isn't an on chain increase), how many more options do we need before the miners pick one?
IMO devs are also a weaker faction than miners, they have 0 power in the protocol voting
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:21:16
so they did, looks like a "market based floating" fee with another 2.4% to close your position, Ill still pass on the closing fee alone, will be interesting to see where fees settle, even at half their starting rate fees are absurd

@_date: 2017-06-10 03:29:09
unfortunately they are only beholden to Bitcoin as far out in the future as the shelf life of their miners, perhaps when more demand comes or leaves the scales will tip toward 2mb, or UASF works, who knows
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:08:45
...so 1% monthly with *another 2.4%* just to close your position, you can break the fees into any increment and they are still outlandish
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:40:31


People are frustrated with miners, the other option is wait until enough people leave or join that 2mb is more profitable than 1, but now 1 is better for miners bottom line, which I'd say is why they don't activate Segwit,xt,classic,BU,EC,109 or any other scaling solution proposed


Perhaps, I'd say it's more likely they are playing stalling games based on them not even running the software they signal for, just a guess though


It does matter, but no one mines for free, hash follows cash

I'm not sure satoshi realized miners would block capacity upgrades in favor of profit
@_date: 2017-06-10 02:35:19
It is a subjective position, but its also undeniable they are making more money with full 1mb blocks than 3/4 full 2mb blocks
