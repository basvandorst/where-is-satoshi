Listen to the negativity and use that as an opportunity to buy when there is fear in the market.

I often use checking and recently noticed I receive my BTC instantly. Not sure if it's because I purchased X amount or made X amount of transactions, but it previously took a few days before the BTC should up in my account.
To your last question, you will pay the current market price, even if there is a delay from the time of purchase to the time of receiving the coin.

I purchased one from Amazon in the US and it only gets 3.5/5 stars with ~600 reviews. However, the vendor says "Ledger Nano S" so hoping that it's legit.

I'm just looking for a small dip back to the 7.5k-8k range to start increasing my position on BTC.

If you believe there is a chance that the price will dip lower than $8k, then dollar cost average and buy part of a coin at the current price, then buy the rest if it dips lower. If you believe we're near the floor and $8k is about as low as the coin will go from now on, then buy the full coin. It's definitely not too late and in a year's time if BTC is any amount higher than $8k, you made profit.

That was my strategy yesterday starting at 9k/BTC, but for every 500 dollars the price dropped.

In my opinion bitcoin under 8k is a steal. Can't perfectly time the bottom so consider dollar cost averaging.

Nearing 8k again at the time of this post (which is healthy.)
