Marijuana is NOT a DRUG 
we support the legalization of Marijuana - a plant with documented medicinal properties 
We are NOT endorsing the Legalization of "DRUGS"

Marijuana should be able to be used medicinally or recreationally , it should be a freedom of choice 
This is a BITCOIN campaign, not converting to fiat is the plan.
working with other organizations such as mpp that do accept bitcoin and creating our own connections within the bitcoin community as it grows.
This is a controversial issue but someone needs to be an active voice within the marijuana community to use this new utility and network that is open to the public to bring about change.
Everyone doesn't agree on marijuana legalization
Everyone doesn't agree about bitcoin
But facts are facts and more $ laundering is done through banks with dollars.
Marijuana is a plant that has been waged war against for the proliferation of petrochemical industry that has been poisoning the earth since the creation of Dupont 
Fattening the pockets of the same banks that launder the drug $ . This isnt about compliance to federal regulations 
This is about libertarian freedom and creation of a new system that doesn't need the banks and fiat.
Bitcoin is a disruptive technology and has the ability to revolutionize humanity.

That is a common misperception which leads us to the point of exactly why we are rallying for legalization.
Alcohol is a drug , tobacco is a drug , 
both fully legal ,abused and with ZERO medical use

Im sure everyone is going to have different opinions of this as expected but comparing it to toyota owners campaigning is just ridiculous - Bitcoin opens the doors to anyone being able to connect and support a cause that they believe in.
We believe in Marijuana Legalization and Bitcoin can open the doors to new support and connect the community in new ways.
