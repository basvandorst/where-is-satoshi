He did nothing wrong by filming the police station. So the real douchebag in this case (and most of other police's cases) is the cop.

For some reason this problem occur also on Chromium 31.0.1650.63 (on RedHat 6.5), but with latest Chromium version (Xubuntu) it's working fine.
Anyway I've donated some BTC.

Until few days ago, the second biggest bank in Israel website's main page, didn't redirect to HTTPS by default! Meaning, login URL could be altered easily with MITM attack.  
This is level of security in banks.

Too many pro-vaccinations posts on Reddit in the last week, with too many upvotes. Now I'm sure the drugs companies running aggressive campaign for vaccines, as legit Reddit posts and comments. Fuck the drugs companies!

Just about one month ago I took an action to remove this wallet from bitcoin.org's recommended wallets page, because of the lake of transparency of this wallet:

Sorry, I did want to buy your products, but I won't use the shitty BitPay service. 
Please accept bitcoin properly (Lightning payments prefered). 
I'm willing to help you implementing proper payment solution, free of charge.
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:05:49
Agreed, but I don't think it's the right place to raise this concern.
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:27:52
And they accept Bitcoin donations! :)

Jeffrey Tucker, one of this fake embassy founders, saying bitcoin.com is the sponsor behind it:

Because it's crashing for example?
@_date: 2017-09-20 16:03:48
I do not know how deeply involved they are in Bitcoin's politics, but anyway I think it was more effective if you told **them** why they shouldn't use BitPay.

The Israeli government and the Israelis are also under control of the bankers, tycoons and the US.

There are not many alternatives with SegWit support, that's the problem. I also like samourai, but it's not stable enough for wide use.

Who is we? Are you part of the coinomi scam?

That's right. But the winner said he will convert it to Bitcoin immediately. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 20:37:12
You don't need to compile by yourself (with reproducible builds, which mycellium supports), you (or others) need to audit the code, to verify it's integrity. In closed source app you can't do it, so it's a scam.

Fortunately I don't care if you like me or not. I care about facts and security.

It's a shame for Mycelium team generally and the CEO especially,  that for so long time after the ICO the Mycelium's tokens are still not trading anywhere.
