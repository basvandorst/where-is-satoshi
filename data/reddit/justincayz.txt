@_date: 2019-07-25 20:55:30
You don't understand the basics of economy at all. Amount of circulating money today has no correlation at all with the potential of the value of btc. Btc could go to $10M tomorrow, it doesn't matter. What matters is how much people will pay for it.

Exactly. You wouldn't be using pennies and cents in the form as coins/change anymore anyway. Just pull up your wallet, scan and done

I find it weird that everybody who claims to have known about bitcoin in the early days say that the only use for it was buying drugs on the dark net. That's not true at all. There were several huge online markets within the gaming communities especially. Ofc people used it on silkroad as well, but MMOE and OGRR, to name a few, were instrumental for bitcoin growth.
"Altogether, the combined forum is significant not just in the video game trading community, but also to Bitcoin itself. [...]
With the acquisition of MMOExchange, Ogrr has a significant opportunity to secure for Bitcoin a strong niche and open the doors to widespread Bitcoin adoption in the area of massively multiplayer online gaming as a whole."
Edit: the people behind Ogrr now run Kraken btw

There were quite a few market sites back in 2010 that used btc, though. In particular for virtual goods, as btc finally combat the paypal/bank chargebacks. Btc was really an awesome invention and helped me alot back then.

This is like saying buying a full suit in 1920 for $4 is a rip-off. The behavior of btc is ofc different than fiat currencies, but in the greater scheme of things, it is kind of like inflation. 1 btc will always be worth more the year after

I wish media would just shut up about btc and cryptos in general now. I cringe every time I read an article and they refer to investers as founders. Jesus.

Tfw your life savings is equivalent to 0.02 btc. Makes me sad to not have more to invest with
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:28:41
Well, you have a point. I still think 99% of new btc holders are just buying to invest as if it were an object though, not to use it

Damn nice job man. When did u start investing?

It's really surprising how little the mainstream media amongst others know about BTC. Last december my countrys biggest newspaper had a 3 page article about one of the founders of Bitcoin. It was a 20 year old kid who hodled a couple BTC. He called himself the founder. Ridiculous.

There's just nothing special with his "prediction". At least the time traveller one is actually interesting. Ofcourse BTC will touch $100K before 2021, don't need a weeb acting like a TA expert telling us this

I think most people on this sub really don't understand that btc is not primarily a investment object. There are millions of people who have always used it in trades for goods. It's fun to invest a little to see the price go up and down, but after all, it's a currency. It's invented for completing safer trades of virtual and physical goods. I believe only a fraction of the BTC is actually bought for investing. It's like the internet; the mainstream side is just the surface. 
@_date: 2019-08-09 23:28:32
I'll edit this with a voice over and post it, brilliant idea!
@_date: 2019-08-12 21:39:41
Quick relevant fun fact about the Norwegian government; another airline were selling very cheap plane tickets, the government ofc couldn't accept this because they didn't get enough money for their part from it, so they literally stopped the company from selling cheap tickets.
I think most people think Norway has a great government, but that is not true at all. Norway is the most expensive country in the world and I would argue our government is one of the most greedy ones. I fukin hate it

It's actually very well optimized, not just thrown out there as a random PC game port. But yeah I'd say mobile is more for afk training and whatnot. I'd definitely recommend checking out Oldschool though, I think you'll love it! It's a backup of the game from 2007, with a lil more content now tho, since it came out in 2013. Amazing devs and community

Yeah, there is a new continent (Zeah) with some new content. I have never been there myself actually, I like to play the game like I always have so I haven't really had the urge to go there yet. But it is good to have more options, tho. There is the GE and god wars and other 2008 content, btw. It's like as if RS went another direction, so instead of going for HD graphics, OP weapons etc which led up to EOC, we now have a version which still gets updates regularly, but stick to the 2007 style and everything is polled so the players take part in deciding.
Feel free to add me: "Ricky Nelson" and I could help u get started

Grunder = somebody who starts a business
I think you call it entrepreneure in english, I was wrong for saying founder. But it's pretty much the same thing, and it's incredibly stupid and it's there 100% for the clickbait title. So stupid.
Edit: the word is in the title, and nowhere else. Makes it even dumber, as they don't even elaborate why they call him that

I don't understand why people think this is groundbreaking news. Ofcourse it is the  crypto... Always will be.

The media coverage of btc is so pathetic. Experts my ass. A couple months ago in Norway they wrote an article about one of the "founders" of bitcoin. It was just a random guy who had ~1 BTC...

Usb mining still a thing? Just for novelty or? 
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:11:51
Ofcourse it's possible. I believe it will. People always underestimate btc and nobody knows what will happen
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:04:18
