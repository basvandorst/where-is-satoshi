Everyone's complaining about the dip even though it's been soaring for the last three days. Surely it's just a good time to buy more? I'm a newbie, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm tempted to invest more today rather than be discouraged.

Not complaining. It was a good day to buy. ��

I'm kidding, but if that happened, I'd eat my own penis.

That is awesome. Keep at it dude. I'm looking out for real world transactions now when I can. That's the whole point after all. ��

I've only been in the game for about five days, so I missed those. Thankfully got in before the nice little rise though. Now just playing the long haul to try and break even.

Just bought some more BTC in the dip. Thank me later for single handedly initiating a massive moon run. Yip, definitely all me. ��

Exactly this. Gotta be prepared to lose everything or we shouldn't be putting a penny near cryptos.

Perfect comment. Have a wee upvote.

Damn right. I started my research five days ago into Bitcoin, altcoins and blockchain technology. Pretty much fell in love immediately. This isn't some shitty get rich quick scheme, it's something to change the world.

I can imagine. Not like I expected an exponential upward curve and to be a bitcoin billionaire over night. I'm more invested for the technology and the ideology, so whatever happens happens. ��

I've only been invested with Bitcoin now for about a week, so this is my first major dip. I didn't panic sell, I've all but got the panic screams under control. Onwards and upwards!
