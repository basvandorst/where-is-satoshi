Well I simply sold some bitcoins for the amount I initially invested in, so whatever happens my initial investment is protected and I don't have any risk.
@_date: 2017-02-14 06:53:06
15%. The Permanent Portfolio suggestion given above is a good one, if you want to avoid tears if for example Bitcoin corrects sharply after a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:38:34
If it drops back to say 300€ I load up the truck :-)
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:10:22
I'm not so sure about that.
@_date: 2017-02-12 15:20:55
So if Bitcoin crashes you've got a big problem?
@_date: 2017-02-21 06:15:38
You mean, just how they create fiat? ;-)
@_date: 2017-02-10 06:55:05
Well over the last weeks the pattern around here seems to be to buy on China PBOC news and to sell around 1000€ I can't guarantee it will work in the future, don't have a crystal ball you know ;-)
Besides this, technical analysis? Divination? Buy and HODL?
@_date: 2017-02-12 15:28:02
Put 105 bitcoins aside and buy Gold bullion for the remaining 105 bitcoins. Whatever happens, the Gold will keep (and probably increase) in value, whatever happens. Bitcoin could be gone tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-02-08 16:29:32
"Nobody likes tofu" so true :-)
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:44:42
I invest in other high risk/reward investments than Bitcoin, that's how I take risk off the table.
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:24:54
Ha ha ha good one
@_date: 2017-02-14 06:56:53
As I understand it, this would only be valid if the hardware did stop improving, which hasn't been the case over the last 40 years
@_date: 2017-02-16 06:30:38
The ETF could sell more shares than it owns bitcoins, creating "paper bitcoins". That would depress the price and allow manipulation.
It is believed that there are currently 300 paper gold ounces per physical gold punce.
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:58:14
Just diversify in other altcoins, then load up the truck on Bitcoin once it has crashed after the fork
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:17:29
I am very satisfied with them, had to contact them once and got a fast reply.
I've been buying bitcoins at their exchange since two years ago.
@_date: 2017-03-12 11:26:23
Software doesn't respond well to business as usual when you hit hard limits.
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:10:24
Good question
@_date: 2017-03-12 09:14:43
What's the push?
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:22:36
Is this meme becoming the Oscars of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:39:12
Aaaaah he's baaaaaaaaaack! :-D
@_date: 2017-03-23 06:19:46
Good question, I don't have the answer to it, but I guess the SEC checks that brokers don't simply lend you shares they don't hold on behalf of their customers.
BTW, I'm more concerned that the ETF could issue more shares than it owns BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:36:06
Popcorn anyone?
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:25:31
Decred has such a system in place
@_date: 2017-03-12 12:13:26
Miners and core are in a gridlock bc they can't agree on the protocol to run on top of tcp/ip.
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:22:17
They can't help it, they want to manipulate Bitcoin just as they do with gold.
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:11:26
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:26:37
So they used margin to pump and dump?
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:01:44
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:56:30
Well I guess that if even the exchanges can't agree on what Bitcoin is/will be, it is time to sell my remaining bitcoins.
I've had enough of this kindergarten drama.
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:50:05
Excellent :-)
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:42:48
Dip? I'm at an ATH
@_date: 2017-01-24 09:30:48
Bitcoin is soooo illiquid.
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:25:13
Yep let the market decide which coin is better.
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:39:30
Bad idea, you will quickly get tired to see the guy all the time
@_date: 2017-01-31 14:06:49
Can go up more often if it also goes down :-)
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:34:28
True the media hammered into our minds to keep BTC in one's wallets. Either OP was stupid or wanted to game the system
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:07:46
Not if they create paper Bitcoin, like they did with paper Gold
@_date: 2017-01-17 05:06:45
I love that dude
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:37:43
On Kraken you can do leveraged margin trading. It's on their home page. Need more proof?
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:21:13
So PBOC did the right thing it seems.
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:11:17
I guess they will be sued out of existence
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:35:23
Bitcoin just landed on the moon
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:50:11
I'm not sure the message is flattering for OP
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:58:39
Say you can get a leverage of 10, so you can buy Bitcoin for 1000$. Then the price falls and the bitcoins are only worth 500$ anymore. You owe 400$ (500$ - your 100$).
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:16:51
LOL if more people want to buy than sell price will go up. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:20:13
Woops indeed:
Their site was down for a while earlier for maintenance so it might be a software glitch
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:17:38
It took me two days to figure this out, so I documented all the steps and wrote a blog post so that others don't have to struggle like I did...
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:26:30
Well, technically it still can go to zero so don't feel bad ... yet ;-)
@_date: 2017-01-17 10:03:36
At least it doesn't get boring ;-)
@_date: 2017-01-30 07:48:10
Ethereum Award? LOL!
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:49:07
We could call it Fedcoin
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:24:17
My god some people just can't let go
@_date: 2017-01-21 10:48:32
That's what I do, I'm using SEPA payments though, don't know how you handle this in US wire transfers.
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:30:48
You know that paper gold to physical gold is leveraged 300 - 1, do you? I don't see how this can be a good thing.
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:19:55
So the recent price spike was due to leverage? That's why one should dollar cost average I guess.
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:13:46
Another reason not to keep your bitcoins at an exchange I guess. Sad to see exchanges being worse than the banksters.
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:22:06
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:23:23
"Bitchcoin" hey I like that name
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:14:09
Exactly, ETFs are the perfect vehicles for central banks to manipulate the price of commodities, stocks, bonds, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:32:59
Bcc is Bitcoin Connect no? Bch is way better
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:28:48
ha ha ha
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:05:15
Yes, right now there are about 300 paper gold ounces per 1 physical gold ounce. I don't see why they wouldn't do the same with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:43:25
I actually had to double-check if I was in the right sub :)
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:58:26
You don't need a wallet to buy and sell BTC and choosing a good trading platform is as much work as choosing a good exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:31:07
Just noticed your username. Upvoted because of that :-)

Where's the Bitcoin rollercoaster guy? :-(
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:41:51
Well they have basically stolen the BCH of their BTC holders
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:23:55
Me neither. I sit on the sidelines and eat popcorn.
@_date: 2016-12-20 11:02:02
Let the manipulation begin
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:40:50
I wouldn't sell but HODL instead. Soon all people that wanted to sell will have sold and then the price could go up.
@_date: 2017-08-02 11:32:00
It's not as if we were warned for weeks that Bitcoin hiccups would be expected around August 1st
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:36:05
It's not as if miners were needed to secure the network, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:15:24
LOL Bitcoin Cash is innovating while Bitcoin is stagnating.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:27:01
Err CME isn't trading yet...

User node count can be faked as easily as Twitter vote counts

@_date: 2017-11-09 21:55:54
I was referring to the first sentence of your comment
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:51:54
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:24:18
More miners = more hashpower = more secure network
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:58:37
Pump and dump is pumping for three weeks now. That's a hell of a pump and dump.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:18:35
What do you expect with such a post title?
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:06:43
That actually is a good strategy for OP
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:46:52
Could be because the owner has a slow internet connection at home, so he uses AWS to run a full node that allows incoming connections with more bandwith
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:52:08
That thumbnail is confusing
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:14:13
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:40:49
So you propose yet another fork of this sub? On a more serious note, there are already countless Bitcoin subs, we don't need yet another one.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:26:38
If you look at the chart, you'll see that BTC fees are nearly ten times as high as BCH's in Satoshi. So If BTC and BCH were at the same price, and a fee in BTC was $5, in BCH would be $0.5.

Did you miss the hedge for free part? Any other altcoin, he has to pay for it. Bad advice
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:57:48
But muh store of value

Ah I thought it was those pesky Russians
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:38:37
Oh really? Did he pay those $800? No. But if BTC goes to zero, then he lost everything.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:28:59
Bitcoin is low risk compared to altcoin ;)
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:09:40
Other projects have a compressed downloadable version of the blockchain. I wonder why they don't do the same in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:54:17
It's not stealing hashpower. Miners can do whatever they want with their hashpower. Miners don't matter anyway, or so I was told in this sub. /s
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:37:22
Very interesting, thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:44:46
He's a proud solitary warrior. I doubt he would want to have anything to do with a place like this.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:15:14
Honestly, it's none of your business
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:33:49
I think the thing is you can quickly (and cheaply) clone nodes on AWS.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:32:32
Well that's certainly true.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:01:30
WHY???? You got them for free, it's the perfect 1-1 hedge, you could just have kept both coins basically risk-free, whatever happens, you'd be good.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:13:06
I don't know about BCash, as it is yet another coin, I only know about Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:53:24
Look at the sidebar. To the right. There's a section called "Community Guidelines". Look at point 4.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:08:38
Did you miss the no shilling in OP's post?
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:17:02


@_date: 2017-11-11 00:07:55
He resurrected Bitcoin and it became Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:03:44
Well, if price continues to go up...
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:17:47
So which numbers matter? No2X Twitter votes?

"None of those things are true"
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:12:19
In the Gold market, there are always these large sell orders that slam down the gold price below $1300. Aren't these also futures contracts?
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:57:03
LOL. Confusing, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:15:43
Shit happens
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:32:28
Can you check the same for Core nodes? (Not even trolling, just wondering)
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:44:42
Well, not everyone thinks miners are irrelevant. Without miners, no Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:56:48
"altcoin that shall not be named is pumping" reminds me of Harry Potter :)
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:12:47

 Only 1.6M? Well, that's cute, I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:49:16
In other words, good for centralized high fee Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:44:47
Now that's silly
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:29:06
Troll angry because he's getting trolled? LOL
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:54:54
If you go to fork.lol you'll see that the price in satoshis is several times higher for BTC than for BCH
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:19:50
Not at all. Fees are high in BTC because blocks are full.
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:45:42
Connect the new hard disk to your PC. Download and install the manufacturer's clone program. Clone the old hard disk onto the new. Replace old disk with new one. Done. I hope you are not working in IT.

1TB drive on Amazon is 50-60 bucks. That's really a bad argument.

Could be, frankly, the last weeks I have seen dozen's of X said Y Twitter posts, and frankly, all this drama is just a waste of time.
All parties should come together, talk to each other and find a compromise, and move forward.
All this Twitter drama doesn't solve anything.
@_date: 2017-04-08 14:24:05
Is this becoming some reality tv or what? Stop wasting our time with some dude's twitter posts.
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:39:32
They could create a sticky Twitter drama thread :-)
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:15:08
Ok but they should really try to keep these Twiiter posts to a minimum.
@_date: 2017-04-24 06:43:09

Bitmain Game Over?
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:04:34
Hodl it's more likely to go up some more. People get tired of FUD and China can't ban Bitcoin another time. Maybe sell a bit again when it's gone up and been stable for a while. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:56:49

@_date: 2017-10-31 18:36:09
You are correct, I don't really understand how futures work. But isn't what is going to be traded something which has an absolute random supply and hence a price that can be completely different from the Bitcoin price because the supply is completely different and delivery never occurs?
Hence my remark that what is traded is "Bitcoin CME", what could be considered an altcoin...
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:35:15
That is your interpretation. The article explains why they might mine empty blocks without intent to spam.
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:28:20
Makes sense
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:08:58

I guess it's the same ones that say that we need regulation now.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:30:53
Well it's not an unconfirmed rumour, it has been planned for at least two months.
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:49:30
Well, Twitter votes, of course
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:42:16
I know this. But in the gold and silver markets, the spot price takes into account the paper gold price. But from my understanding, Coinmarketcap for example excludes futures prices, in other word, any paper market prices.
Because otherwise, the Bitcoin price is open to manipulation and the bankers have won.
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:45:40
Corporations already own Bitcoin, one is called Blockstream.
@_date: 2017-09-07 07:33:49
It's a fork not an altcoin

I find it rather comical that you are calling me ignorant, redditor for three months.
Anyway, merchant adoption in BCH is increasing. The recent block production instability doesn't seem to have impacted the price, quite to the contrary, people are used to it now. The instability will be fixed in two weeks, so BCH is undervalued now IMO.
At the same time, Segwit adoption has decreased and is stalling:
If BTC price goes up and yet more users try to transact in BTC, the network congestion will get worse and worse. Not taking into account the fork end of November where BTC could screech to a halt.

Segwit1X has no EDA. If 95% support Segwit2X, Segwit1X gets only 5% hashpower. This means blocks will take 20x longer to mine. 1 confirmation -&gt; 2 hours. 6 confirmations -&gt; 12 hours. Mempool will fill up, fees increase. Transactions will take forever. No one will use that coin. A difficulty adjustment takes 2016 blocks -&gt; 4032 hours -&gt; 168 days.
Segwit1X is in the same position as Bitcoin Cash, but without the emergency difficulty adjustment. The only solution is if Core HARDFORKS to implement an EDA.

OK thanks, with your explanation it is more clear. The question I still have, is does the price of the bets influence the price of Bitcoin regular investors pay on an exchange?
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:07:59
"Do you? Why is that relevant?"
That's why it's relevant: 
I concede that I'd have made better gains keeping BTC at this moment. But BTC's fundamentals are weak. I ordered a Bitwala Bitcoin card this week. The card cost 1.826 ($10.68) mBTC and the network fees were an additional 0.46556 mBTC ($2.72). That's a fee of 25.5%! And that was a Segwit transaction!
Do you really think BTC will be succesful with such high fees? Bitcoin is a currency. If fees are high, people will use something else. That's why I think BCH has better fundamentals.

Section 4, Satoshi Whitepaper:
"The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision
making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it."

Sorry but not all users are on Core's side.
@_date: 2017-10-07 17:46:33
This is not an attack, this is the normal way to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol. An attack is when an entity tries to overtake the network with hashpower so it can rewrite the transaction history.
If Core weren't so stubborn, the HF would proceed smoothly for everyone and there would be no risk of anyone sending coins to an obsolete minority chain.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:32:40

Your argument makes sense, whereas OP posts, not much.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:14:25
Well maybe there were just much less transactions in 2015? Hence more empty blocks...
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:38:30
Ok to be more clear buying a miner and consuming electricity are expenses or depreciating assets, whereas buying BTC is an investment which most likely will go up.

I heard it could be Catalonia as they are looking into an e-Residency program like in Estonia and also in adopting a cryptocurrency as national currency.
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:01:45
As I understand it, if 90% of hashrate goes to S2X, blocks will be produced at 1/10 the current speed. That means one block every 100 minutes. Confirming a transaction with 6 blocks would take 600 minutes, e.g. 10 hours. Additionally, transaction fees would soar because of full blocks.
And because there is no EDA in Bitcoin, a difficulty adjustment would have to wait 20 weeks to adjust instead of 2 weeks. Only solution to this problem would be a ... hardfork to add an EDA.
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:32:09
Honestly, after seeing all the FUD about empty blocks here, I'm flabbergasted by the low percentage.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:36:07
Well I'm probably the idiot.
Anyway let's say that there is a player with deep pockets, very very deep pockets. Let's call the player "Soldman Gachs". Can't he just buy a very large numbers of "bitcoins" at a future date at a high price (driving the current "bitcoin" price higher) or sell a high number of "bitcoins" at a future date at a low price (driving the price lower).
And because Soldman can settle in cash, he never needs to buy or sell real bitcoins. Does this make any sense?
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:28:03
The other day, for a Segwit transaction of 10$, I had 25% fees. This will not work out in the long run.
