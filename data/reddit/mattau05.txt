I agree. Im buying to hold, not flip anyway. Still, frustrating because I intended to do this a few days ago but got busy at work. No way I could lose THAT much waiting a few days right? Ha!

Traded half my ETH for BTC. What immediately followed was a $1500 BTC drop. Sorry guys. My bad.

But that's the point. That isn't free. Yet we still use that term, for whatever reason.

I would love an explanation as to how healthcare could possible be FREE anywhere. Hell, tell me one place where it is free. The only times I know of where healthcare is free is where charities and individuals donate their time and money. But I think you're talking about single-payer. And if there's a single PAYER, that really means we all pay, plus for the government red tape. Doctors also get paid less (because the government bureaucrats need their cut). And I isn't free in any sense of the word.

According to Wikipedia, treatment is at no cost if you are under 12, and $1 per consultation for citizens. Also, Brunei is basically a dictatorship and has been technically under continuous martial law for quite a while.
All that said, even if you're under 12 it isn't "free." It costs something Everything costs something. The money to run the hospitals, pay the doctors, pay for medication, comes from somewhere. Just because you don't pay when you walk in for treatment (or only pay $1) doesn't mean that no one is paying.

Truth in billing is the biggest healthcare problem that we don't talk about enough. And it precisely because we don't have a true free market.

Victim identification is notoriously ineffective. I wouldn't trust it.
