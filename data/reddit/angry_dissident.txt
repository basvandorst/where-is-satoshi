If you look on their sidebar, you will see a list of local offshoots, including Canada, the UK, about 12 cities, and 4 American states. Australia should be joining soon.    [is the Canadian version. We are a day and a half old, and have about 250 subscribers.

You are the first person to bring this up. I know what section 8 means to Americans. We made it 'section 8' because it is section 8 of the Canadian Charter.
