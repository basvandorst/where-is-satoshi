Because you are your own bank and your security is probably not as good as theirs

Whatever happened to a free country, so many whiners

I was referring to "Australia does not class BTC as a currency" 
@_date: 2014-10-27 22:22:54
Serious concerns for Govt. future in regards to the Central Banks
@_date: 2014-12-23 11:45:33
Not in Australia, because its not a "currency"
@_date: 2014-11-26 11:56:42
Compared to every Govt. currency, its not a ponzi

Once the (debt laden) currencies' freefall start to gain momentum I'm pretty sure they will experience attrition before bitcoin does

"legitimized" so  they can charge you an extra 10% tax when you buy BTC in Oz

These guys are competitive if you are into that sort of mining

Just keep fighting a few more years, US resources are dwindling they are heading the way of Rome over-extension and collapse.Lucky we have Bitcoin to use when the finance system eventually collapses

The change is just to incredible for people to understand, you need to have a basic understanding of what "Money" really is first. Baby-boomers hate it because it will affect their welfare state which is all they have really known

You may be a bit premature, QE has only been over for a day, long term the US is going to bust. Mathematics will win in the end

"The individuals that add bitcoin to their reserves sooner will be the richer individual tomorrow."

How did you know lol

Like governments, the bottom people stop paying, the whole thing collapses

 Its now "legal" because they want the transfer of bitcoin to become a  taxable event even though it classed as "non money", so every  transaction in BTC you make you have to convert an extra 33% to fiat to pay the NZ tax department
@_date: 2019-08-15 01:29:28
Once you are paid in bitcoin and declare that address to the government, then spend the BTC the person that receives it could buy illegal goods and the government and out somehow they will want to know who that person is, guess who is going to get interrogated, zero privacy same as the banks, actually more efficient for the gov as they don't need a middle man, subservience societies dream come true

Is there any credible evidence that they have 165K coins, or are we just meant to believe the media, we know how they always tell the truth. I read one report where they said they "found" 200,000 coins, did they find them under a pillow?
@_date: 2015-02-02 08:24:23
Everyone else will be fine
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:36:44
I need advice on what I CAN do recklessly
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:17:25
You are right Bitcoin is to confusing for you, you should stick to fiat
