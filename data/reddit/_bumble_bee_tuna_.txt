I think they bought visa or amex cards. Since they are as good as cash. Its kinda like they left with a free $250. The card company is then charging the business the 250. So its like the business made $250 but spent $500 to earn it.
This is rather hard to explain.

They are likely already used. Since there as good as cash its likely un trackable.
