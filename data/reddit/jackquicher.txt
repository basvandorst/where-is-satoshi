Troll alert. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 16:32:07
And this is why people outside this sub make fun of Bitcoiners. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:44:33
Huh what?
@_date: 2015-01-23 06:42:26
Sure. It looks very healthy. Just keep telling yourself that. 
Yes, downvoting makes it all go away. Who needs reality when you have fantasy. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 20:16:02
Give the guy a break. He only had a few million and 2 years to make a functioning forum. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:50:53
You seriously think this is gonna happen? No way you are that naive. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 00:35:05
Yeah that's bad. 
And the Maryland process where they're gonna do the murder for hire thing won't be pretty either. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 10:51:31
Only when he praises Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 06:56:52
Truth hurts eh?
@_date: 2015-01-23 09:18:28
Idiot. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 18:27:08
The free market will sort it out. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 07:11:40
There is no good way to do that. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 16:14:04
Which you have absolutely no proof of of course. 
It's insane how wild speculation like this gets so many upvotes. 
I know nothing about this issue or who these people are but the constant accusations here about paid shills and bots and what not is kinda crazy. Even more if you consider that noone is ever able to back up their claims. 
There is a lot of paranoia in this sub. A lot. 
Ah of course. This will be downvoted to hell by the cultists. The same cultists who cry about downvotes all day long. They absolutely hate reality and facts. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 10:49:45
When he talks about Bitcoin in a positive way it's on top of the mainpage with nothing but praise and moon posts. Because when Bill Gates says something like that it's amazing news. One of the top tech guys!
But when it turns out he really isn't that interested in Bitcoin it suddenly doesn't matter because he actually is just a nobody who has no clue about anything. 
This place is hilarious. That your post gets upvoted like crazy is the funniest thing i've seen all week. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:18:31
Haha yes i know, it's insane really. They post it as if it's a fact and the rest of cult upvotes those posts. 
Anybody who questions this gets, the irony, downvoted. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 16:30:59
Jesus Christ. Who cares?
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:02:00
The fact that posts like this get downvoted proves your point. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 15:41:48
Haha you got downvoted for having a personal opinion about the price which happens to be negative. Hilarious! You are not allowed to do that here and you got "punished" for it. This place is a riot. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 13:33:16
No. I prefer not to lose my money. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 18:21:13
Don't be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:27:23
Wrong audience. 90% of the people here want to get rich with their 0.5 coin. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:34:39
There is a massive circle jerk going on. Nobody cares about this fact. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 20:55:23
Yes we know. There are already 2 or 3 circle jerks about it here. No need for another one. 
And i love how someone not getting his money is reason for a party. 
Just like people here have a raging hard on when a country goes to shit and millions suffer. That's heaven for many Bitcoiners. Can't get any better than that.
@_date: 2015-01-22 20:06:00
Affected. 
Apparently the most difficult word in the English language. 
And out of curiosity. When someone gets scammed out of some coins and gets nothing back due to lack of consumer protection do you also say "Paypal user not effected"? If not, why not?
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:54:27
If you are not sure then why do you still refuse to use the search?
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:57:26
If i post something slightly critical about Bitcoin i usually get downvoted within a minute. Also bots?
Edit: i see the bots are fired up. 
Bitcoiners crying about downvotes. It's one of the most retarded and hypocritical things i've seen in a long time. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:14:07
Nice spam. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:58:58
It would do absolutely nothing for adoption. Just like the 20 other times Bitcoin was mentioned in a tv show. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 18:32:27
These kinds of posts just make you look so desperate. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:12:35
You must suck at searching then. 
Took me 5 seconds. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:38:17
But...but his mother said he was innocent!
@_date: 2015-01-24 16:46:13
Huh? Every day i have to read posts here about why the low price is reaaaaaally good for Bitcoin because then everybody can buy cheap coins. 
Now you're telling me we don't want other people to buy coins? Confusing. 
Yes my cultists, just downvote it and it will all go away. Fuck reality!
@_date: 2015-01-24 16:49:53
Aaaaand you're downvoted. This place is hilarious. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:02:35
Is there a specific reason why you didn't use the search?
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:43:41
Ah my bad. Silly me. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 10:52:57
Who cares, right. 
Other than 99% of this sub the other day when they wrongly believed he was gonna invest in Bitcoin. You know, that huge thread on top of the mainpage praising Bill Gates and Microsoft.
