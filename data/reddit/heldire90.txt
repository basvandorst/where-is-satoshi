Can I just say... if you’re so easily throwing in money. Make sure you follow the  rule. 
Hodl. 
You haven’t lost/made anything until you realise the profit/loss.

If you do some research, you’ll find it’s true. Same thing occurs with every milestone of technological advancement, the previous  of spouts how it won’t work/be efficient in society.

Don’t try to time it. Make the decision and stick with it knowing your jumping off the moving vehicle and could land terribly. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:43:58
Yup. I use it. Haven’t had any issues yet and never heard any bad news. 
I do wonder where it gets it’s price for BTC and would like if it was displayed on screen, not much what my btc is worth at the time.

I’m in Australia so I presume it’s global. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:52:49
It’d be a shame if the world had to leave behind the USA. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:36:18
There is no fork. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:04:18
Transactions are based of the fee paid. 
I use an Aussie site called CoinSpot and they set the fee (I assume high) to move offsite anyway. It’s currently 0.001 fee ($22aud) for any amount. Dam that’s high.

You buy the coin on whatever exchange you deem reasonable. 
Then you buy a nano ledger S, or trezor wallet FROM THEIR WEBSITE (to avoid potential tampering from external parties), then transfer from exchange to wallet.

This guy contingencies. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:07:01
Question - if there are zero fees, how will the miners make profit once all coins are mined?
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:54:07
Wouldn’t that already be priced in?
Don’t forget the USA isn’t the only players in this market. ��
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:04:13
No one cares about those forks anymore haha. Scam coins. 
The big worry is CME futures trading.

Menu &gt; settings &gt; sync blockchain
Will take about 20-40 minutes to fully sync it up.

I wondered this too. I didn’t have any BTC in for the bitcoin cash fork, just for the Gold one. Looks like they haven’t released the option yet to claim Gold. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:49:38
More likely is BTC dropped 5% and the rest followed suit cause fear. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:06:07
Since bitcoin is the gateway to the alts in most exchanges, yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:28:31
Yes? 
If it meets your requirements. 
Slight delay in releasing the bitcoin gold funds though, which is annoying. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:24:18
They don’t like what they can’t contain. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:20:19
You say no way, but I got in just prior to the China drama in Sept, when Bitcoin was $4-5k usd. I thought the same thing, and now the price has doubled, which is still an amazing outcome. 
Sure, it won’t be 1000%, but I’m not complaining I didn’t get that and only a x2 of initial investment. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:23:23
Say bye bye to your moon condo

Resync the blockchain my friend. I had this issue, this resolved it. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:08:58
I spent a large portion of my savings on bitcoin 3 weeks ago when it had spiked up to $7,300AUD. It then sat there for roughly 3 weeks before being at the current moment $8965...
Those 3 weeks had me second guessing at buying at the then ATH. Now I’m laughing. 
TLDR buy now. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:21:39
The news was announced on the devs twitters and posted in Powr forums. Apparently more official announcements to come this week. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:24:06
I jumped in and got some btc two months ago, and it sat at the same price for doily 3 weeks, fluctuating $500. Was wondering the whole time if I had made a mistake. 
Then it flew up $3,000 and I forgot all my worries. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:27:02
G’day mate. 
I would remember that when the price drops $500 in a day it doesn’t matter, because I’m not planning to cash out due to a loss of price at that very moment in time. 
You only win/lose when you cash out. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:08:41
Yup exactly. ��

Being the superpower doesn’t really mean much after a certain point. 
With so many others able to defend/attack (Russia/China as first examples) being the top dog means little in the grand scheme. If shit was to go down, we’re all going down with it. 
It’s only a deterrent for the smaller countries at this point. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:34:13
I believe the wallet holding the Mt Gox coins is known and has been linked with the dumps. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:32:08
When was this?
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:11:12
This weeks ATH might be next weeks low.
