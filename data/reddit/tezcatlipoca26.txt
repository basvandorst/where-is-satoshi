There is absolutely nothing wrong with him taking profits. It is his decision and has nothing to do with whether he believes in the coin or he doesnt.
Edit: I dont own LTC.

I found this so hilarious. What a time to be alive. HODL.

I dont think there are any alt coins able to deal with scaling issue because AFAIC the technology is just not there quite yet. But it is safe to say there are a lot of alt coins with far better and more reliable tech than BTC. 
Regarding your comparison between BTC scaling issue and internet scaling issue I dont think it makes much sense. The internet boom was composed of Private Companies with incentive for profits. I think you are bound to be unhappy when you realize the people working on Lightning Network are not doing it out of the generosity of their hearts. You need to use the LN channels to make transactions and pay them a fee which is totally fine but it goes against the very idea of decentralization. You just cant have it both ways. I also dont think the LN Network is going to fix the scaling issue all by itself.

As if BTC has already succeed. I am hodler but lets not be stupid please.

I got in BTC one and a half months ago just because I wanted to ride the hype train but the more I read on BTC compared to other cryptos the more I see BTC for what it really is - an idea. A revolutionary one. But I think it is way too limited and there is no Lightning Network that could fix it. I have sold 90% of my BTC position and just gonna spread it other alts and new ICOs.

Yes of course that can happen. But I try to make the best decision available at any time with the information I have. For better or worse.

Private sector baby.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:38:19
I wouldnt invest more than 10%.
Edit: 20% tops if you are really confident and have done your research.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:45:00
Wouldnt be first time so what the hell.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:18:07
Ty for your time to say absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:27:17
i got in at $6500 and holding like a fucking boss.
EDIT: Not even sweating. Just enjoying the ride.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:33:45
Already have investments on those.

Once BTC survives this shitshow its gonna hit $10k by DEC 31st
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:16:17
So is this a reflection of the greedy money on BTC leaving? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:47:01
Thanks! This is pretty interesting.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:54:29
Thanks, but no thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:06:15
So why is the price plummeting?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:35:50
Why not just sell a % of it instead of going with the sell everything or hold everything mentality?
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:32:10
I will be fine if I lose this 25k. My research or knowledge on crypto is not amazing but so far I was thinking going 80% BTC, 6.66% ETH, 6.66% LiteCoin, 6.66% Monero.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:59:17
Yeah I am too much of a noob to engage in that. You could so easily scam me.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:38:16
I say it dips to $5500 and if it cracks below that it will dip even harder and then I will buy.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:44:39
Long term. Not looking to actively trade.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:48:48
"Suicide themselves" as opposed to suicide another person besides you?
EDIT: also cool story bro 
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:50:31
Was finally able to buy it. €4.5k worth of BTC. Leggoooo.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:57:43
16th November I believe.
