Nah. People will just forget what a cent means but still say it with a common understanding of the phrase. Similar to "mind your Ps and Qs". Fyi...pints and quarts. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:00:35
Thats my M O.

Hey man relax. What exactly were you trading? Btc for what? What do have left? It should be easy to make your money back with a little help. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:15:19
My understanding is that it refers to crowded pubs in which people would get their drinks confused with others so bar owners would start telling patrons to "mind their pints and quarts". This became a term used to tell someone to stay on track.

Using a bank account wont be instant. Only credit card purchase is instant.

Heres proof of my purchases and payouts: 
My ref link was removed by AutoMod. PM if you want it. fyi...I'm matching the ref bonus in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:16:12
Its a bonus on top of what you purchase. Obviously. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:04:47
Yes, absolutely. Blockchain is definitely more advanced then the current banking system. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:40:41
This is bullshit. No one wins.

Oh. So store the backup on a usb in a different fireproof safe. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:07:41
Really? So where is that backup being stored? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:52:33
I'd say this supports XRP more than bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:14:35
Im getting this error now. any help?
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:03:24
You and I and a few other people here know what that means. But how many people do you really think understand that and know how to use it to their advantage? Keep in mind that 49% of people are below average intelligence.

You don't have to invite someone to withdraw your earnings. The free 10KH is applied to the hash that you buy, so if you buy 100KH you'll have 110kh. But you cant sit there with the free 10KH and withdraw from its earnings, you do need to make a purchase before you can withdraw...obviously.
You get a 6% hash bonus from referrals. If your referral doesnt make a purchase you wont get 6% of the free 10KH (obviously), you only get 6% of what they purchase. 
tl;dr you don't have to refer users at all.

To a point. I would worry about plugging that thing in 10 years from now and it doesnt work. 
I run a VM on my desktop that contains my desktop wallets. The VM is backed up to multiple sources both local and in the cloud. that way if the VM or my desktop crash, I can always just get a new computer, install HyperV, and import the VM from backup.

Use coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:36:59
There's a wallet file somewhere. Hopefully encrypted. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:06:40
Like what? It's the easiest and most user-friendly exchange I've found. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:43:27
Wow congratulations. You can try withdrawing through Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:42:08
Lol no

BTC is for investing. Think of it as buying/selling stocks with high commission fees. There are better coins for daily use as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:39:14
Wtf 
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:50:08
The fee probably cost more than the beer. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:47:02
I'm not sure what you mean. I prefer XMR or LTC as better options to BTC for paying for something.

Any insight to how the fork will be handled for coins in Exodus wallet?
