That would be great if I knew how haha. I can imagine me messing it up and loosing.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:01:54
Ok, so the price that's displayed is the full price you get?
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:26:20
Lucky devil ��
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:38:02
That's a cool way of looking at it. I wonder how many people in the world own a piece of a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:17:40
Im from the UK. I use bittylicious and localbitcoins. Also check out 
This finds the cheapest coins you can buy from an exchange.

@_date: 2017-08-13 09:36:56
I'm wondering the same thing. I've got 0.815 BTC. Would be nice to buy rest to get 1 whole BTC! 
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:36:16
Can I use a wallet on my computer instead?
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:51:50
I've actually been wondering, does owning a fraction of a coin make you a bitcoin owner??
I'm in the same boat as you, recently bought 0.945 btc so I can't device where that makes me a official bitcoin owner, or something else?
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:18:29
Nice pad!
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:35:27
Yeah I actually posted a similar question yesterday. I guess the maximum number their will ever be is 21 million. However like you say that will only ever go down since people will loose keys and seeds. I imagine hundreds of thousands of Coins have already been lost.
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:07:57
Thats a lotta money
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:13:47
Yeah I'll definitely get some more paper copies of the seed and store them in various places. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:42:14
That would be splendid!
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:14:46
Wow im minted!
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:02:59
How so?
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:41:43
What provider is most reccomended?
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:19:21
I'm thinking about buying 1 whole coin.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:41:29
That would be nice haha
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:40:11
 Just bought this new Lamborghini here
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:43:45
Do you think it's worthwhile purchasing an extra 0.19 coins? Or could be we I. For a dip in the market, and buy then?
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:42:40
That thought did cross my mind..
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:15:18
I'm in for the long haul
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:03:22
Why don't you try a different exchange website?
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:38:22
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:44:53
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:38:25


I'm going to see if the price drops a bit closer to what i originally paid the other day and buy the rest of the 0.19 then!
who knows, maybe the price will never drop...
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:40:44
A mystery!
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:35:16
I just bought 0.81 of a coin over the course of yesterday and today too! hopefully this is worth it. Id like to get it up to 1 whole BTC for the mental satisfaction!
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:29:19
I'm exactly the same, invest a couple hundred bucks in 4 or 5 now when they are cheap, and HODL!
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:28:01
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:49:54
About three fiddy
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:31:38
If you don't know your password, you need the seed of to recreate the wallet. If you have neither your out of luck
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:52:47
Yeah, your right actually...
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:40:13
This is actually kinda true for me
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:04:58
We good
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:17:35
$100,000 by 2018
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:43:38
Hope it continues
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:27:10
True, that puts it into context haha. I guess Im just getting to use to this constant rapid growth!
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:08:04
$40, not bad eh. I use electrum myself. I know that the wallet address appears to  randomise. When I've been buying coins and putting my wallet address into the exchange for where to transfer, my water address appears to always be different. I don't know why this is though.
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:03:30
Yes it's what most people including myself use.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:16:27
Do I need to register as a seller? Or can I just change the drop-down option from buy to sell and go that way. Also is the calculated value what you receive or do fees need to be taken off this?
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:18:03
There's a bit of a dip happening now!
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:32:36
Baby steps, we'll get to the moon eventually
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:34:20
Yeah I still have 1 BTC so that's all good!
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:28:53
C'mon lads that's enough
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:21:26
Fingers crossed!
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:41:06
But 500k would be nice
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:08:11
I knew the dip was coming!
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:02:54
Ah I see

@_date: 2017-08-13 18:11:51
Nice and reassuring to read. Hope it comes out to be true. Just invest myself over the last few days.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:32:48
How long will that take?
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:20:32
Ah ok, that's unfortunate
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:51:12
I have electrum, you can change the units so it's BTC by default.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:56:54
Yeah I'm tempted to do the same, if the price dips to what i paid a few days ago I'll go for it. Since I bought though the price has just kept climbing.
I wish I just bought 1 whole BTC when i first make my purchases!
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:37:06
Hopefully we can get back the be big gains we experienced over the weekend!
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:51:26
Yesss nice one!
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:55:09
Why not?
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:45:13
I'm not too sure to be honest. I'm fairly new to all this all I know is how cold wallets work since that's what I use, cloud based wallets may work differently. Hopefully someone here can help you!

about 7 years ago
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:17:48
What do you mean by it's too early in the making?
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:39:02
The password to the wallet would be whatever you originally set it as when you first set it up. The seed was also generated, it's typically a 12 word phrase which you can use to regenerate your wallet on the case you loose your original.
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:36:48
What do you think 1 BTC be worth in 4 years?

Trading 212
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:29:12
I got badly burnt doing this just the other day. 
I put £300 into my trading 212 account, over the weekend we had that huge spike which brought my investment upto £1300! Then Tuesday we had the crash. I kept thinking it would stablise  but before I knew it I was actually down on money...
If only I cashed out at £1300... I'm so angry at myself.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:58:03
My plan is to invest now and see how it is come the end of the year and cash in some of it then. Hoping it continues growing at the rate it has been the past month or so!
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:08:45
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:23:35
Please help sir!
Thanks
