Obey the spirit of the reddit comment, and not the letter, for typing on mobile is wrought with spelling errors. Amen.

You have no business trying to moderate here if you are unaware of altcoins.

I gave him the address of my wallet and he sent me bitcoin. Coinbase seems like a more userfriendly wallet. Every other exchange seems to have a website that is barely fucking functional, so sorry I picked the wrong place to host my wallet.
I guess the lesson learned is that bitcoin is just a load of shit that people keep pumping up so they can increase the value of their own coins.

no I didn't, it was on coinbase.com when I added it as an account

my thoughts exactly. In my settings I clicked to add an acount, and then it required the username and password. I thought is was BS too so I used an empty account of mine just in case. I also have 2FA

Yeah it fucking sucks, but it seems like its basically the only option in the US?
