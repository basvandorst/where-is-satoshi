The problem is it's not mine. It's used for research and it's in a lab. It takes up a large room. Would be nice if I could've used it, but this is probably for the best. Maybe I can convince them to do it, I don't know.

Heh, it would be nice if I could, but it's proprietary and we don't want our competitors to obtain any info. That, and I don't want to be taken off the project. I'm permitted to say we work on design and analysis of computer algorithms, along with our "sister" hardware research group, but that's about it.

It was supposed to be a win from satoshi dice... I was using the bitcoin-qt client, I don't know what he uses.

That only seems to get the balance for the default account  which is named "". I have other accounts, and it only shows the one.

Any tips on how to speed it up at all? Even just running getbalance on one account seems to take 5 seconds or so to return a value.

Hmm, I'll have to try that.

I'm just getting into coding with bitcoin, and I don't know any better, haha. Just writing a small old school VB app to play around with. I can't seem to figure out how to not use accounts once they exist already in my wallet. Also, I was playing around with satoshi dice, and it seems to send the coins from one account, but receive with another. Not sure how that works since it's supposed to send back to the same address you send from.

Thanks for clarifying. It's really a shame; this machine has a lot of wasted downtime.

Eh, didn't work. It returned the balance for an account named '', which was 0.

I asked, and they said "it could compromise the integrity of the experiments", and yeah, they're probably right. Though we're scheduled to wrap everything up around the end of the year, and I have no idea what they will do with it then. Who knows, maybe by then the ASICs will be a better option anyway.

Thanks for the info. Also, your deductive powers are impressive...

Are you using accounts? Also, I'm on Windows 7, could that be it? Maybe the way it interprets quotes? Eh, there are workarounds but it would be nice if it worked for me.

Yes, it's synched and up to date. It's been stuck at unconfirmed.
