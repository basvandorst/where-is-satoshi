Sorry about my ass writing im using writing-to_ text

Well, that's not true.. 
If you want a functional road or school in your neighborhood will you go donate your money yourself?
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:20:10
That's an incoherent conversation homy.

He doesn't have a reason, it's a spam account. Looks like StockTwits lol

But in their property using their service. If you aren't in the airport they can't do anything. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:54:15
One day I will have all the internets..  thanks for the tip that's pretty cool.first time, feels good man.
edit: I can't figure out how to actually get the tip.
@_date: 2013-05-02 19:25:35
I don't know why I assumed this was going to be a trainwreck, I guess I'm a dick. Good on this guy for knowing whats going on.
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:24:40
Oh wow. Smear campaign. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:35:37
I'm on mobile so I can't be assed to cite. XNA has had a few threads where they dismantle GO. Google it. Just get ADW launcher or Apex. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:20:13
It's the same info.
@_date: 2013-04-28 03:34:15
This thread is making me feel all giddy with joy ahaha what an awesome thing here 
@_date: 2013-08-12 00:11:48
I doubt they anticipated security would be necessary for possible hundreds of thousands $ on cellular gadgets... 
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:37:15
You can't really disagree with that, flying is not a right. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:53:52
And two minutes later Albert is under a different screen name. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:55:03
I haven't been able to watch so I can't tell if sarcasm. 
So at the risk of a whoosh.. 
Was it really? 
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:25:05
I see you have a couple GO widgets but I don't see the launcher. Not sure about them, but stay away from GO launcher, it is essentially spyware. It relays way too much information to China. Also, any widget you use on a GO launcher home screen, the launcher has complete access to (this is an agreement you consent to when you place your first widget in GO)
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:06:12
So I shouldn't hold onto the as a prospector. And I should trade it like a day trader...   Should I go buy drugs with it or what? 
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:36:17
hey so.. what do I do with this tip? I've never done, and I don't know how to get it..
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:20:51
Won't be possible so long as bitcoin moves like a trade. People see opportunity to make "easy" money here. 
@_date: 2013-03-14 01:58:14
I got that part. I'm asking about what happens to the economy. If I was able to divide a dollar bill to. . 0001 I'd still need plenty more before that would be useful
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:11:57
Apex/Nova, whatever. They are the same. Also check out Lightning Launcher for crazy customization.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:31:44
Awesome, thanks. I had fun looking through the PSD. It looks great.
@_date: 2013-05-07 14:37:33
What's your turnout?
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:22:54
These spook sites really make me feel like the bitcoin is a scam.
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:30:54
Yeah good idea, that easy they can fix their malicious code so they don't get caught next time!  Aha joking ..but seriously I don't see how that would help.
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:26:52
how does all this "free bitcoin" crap work? what is a faucet?! and how is sitting in a minecraft server profitable for all the parties involved, how can they justify paying for being there?
@_date: 2013-03-24 05:01:26
This is the type of shit that makes bitcoin lose credibility to outsiders
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:00:44
Yeah I agree with you completely, and I like this response here. I was just referring to dismissing that an argument has any value just based on small details like spelling, or perhaps assuming someone's intelligence from such. I thiiink that's an aspect of the strawman? I can't recall my pop psych right now but I think you know what I mean. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:01:18
I think that's the point, I know i prefer it that way. I don't know what the market value will be in 5 days, I want what I saw on the price tag. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 04:51:42
Wtf not a real place I was really hoping for some easy prey.
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:25:48
Isn't it in the nature or spirit of bitcoin to thanklessly help others? Spread the love ppl, this is big shit happening, it's within our power to make right for the world.
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:35:34
I've had one issue, and it was resolved immediately. Otherwise Coinbase isn't too shabby.
@_date: 2013-07-09 19:12:53
How many people working on this project? 
If its only a few then it will flop. There's an extreme range of professional expertise that goes into designing a modern functional phone. How will he get ahold of the hardware that supports this, or is he making drivers for every chipset from scratch? 
One thought,  he's designing it with Linux kernel. Android. So his project is already half done! Lol. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:35:39
That looks like a coincidence. I think the artist is just going for a sharp design that pops.
@_date: 2013-04-27 15:21:57
I had a PS3* I set up for 22. Ran a month. Got nothing but a fat electricity bill.
(PlayStation 3)
@_date: 2013-03-14 01:56:24
And goods will become cheap enough to make purchases and live a modern lifestyle with. . 0001 btc? Or for example you work all day and make.   . 0005 btc, that will be enough to sustain? 
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:57:26
I have 2 :-(
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:31:19
Why did you bold the word "now"? 
@_date: 2013-03-14 02:15:19
 makes sense thanks...   but unfortunately the rich will always still be rich. only now we won't be able to know who has what.
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:40:06
That's some pretty dangerous use of logic.
@_date: 2013-03-11 18:11:57
You mean easier for you :-P 
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:16:26
I thought android was supposed to be secure by not allowing one app to access another? 
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:12:55
Layer 11, the shadow under the B, did you go through a few mechanical steps to get that or did you just paint it? 
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:36:13
I think they are too short on manpower. They have been looking to hire for a while.
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:46:24
I've never actually seen anyone call bitcoin terrorism.
@_date: 2013-03-09 16:54:32
These guys are making me nervous about owning bitcoins ... 
@_date: 2013-03-15 14:32:37
It's so backwards from the dollar. One dollar was worth a lot. Then you needed two dollars for the same thing. Then you needed 100, then 1000. Yet, goods get cheaper. Bitcoin started with 1. Then you'll need. . 5.  Then you'll need..  .05. (fucking phone keyboard messing with my words)  I'm curious to see where this goes. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 04:50:16


I liked the part where you said that..
WHOOSH
