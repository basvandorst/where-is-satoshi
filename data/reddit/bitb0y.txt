Who would be the lender?

Okay, so you're saying that person A would most likely be willing to lend person B for example, $600k for a new home. That should be easy enough, right? In today's world, that's why we have banks.

I know what smart contracts are and how they work. How does that relate to my question? All you did was state the most fundamental aspect of a coin that I didn't ask about.

Wouldn't that be a bank though?
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:28:08
Exactly what I'm thinking.

Yeah, I can tell you're young. I can also tell that you have no idea how cryptocurrency works.

My apologies that the sentence fragment you posted wasn't totally clear.

I just did a quick search.. and found that the "low rates" they're offering are 20%... the average APR rate on a mortgage is around 4%...

...so.... what ?

I can tell you're young, but the loans I'm referring to aren't $20 from your buddy to buy a bag of pot. I'm talking about large loans to buy big things, like houses and cars. When I asked "who would be the lender?", I was really asking "who would have enough money on hand and willing to lend it?". "Literally anyone" implies that anyone would be willing and able to lend huge (6 or 7, or maybe 8 digit) sums of money. In the world we live in today, banks are the only people who can do that in 99% of the cases, unless you go to a loan shark, which is illegal and way more expensive than going to a bank. A smart contract would be helpful for keeping track of a loan and interest, but not helpful in finding a lender.
