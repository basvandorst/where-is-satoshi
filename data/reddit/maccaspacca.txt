I still think paying to improve on something that has already been done and tested in the altcoin world is really stupid. The money could be spent on something much better like marketing strategies for improving real world adoption.

Can't really see how this is relevant to Bitcoin but it does prompt some questions in my mind, perhaps someone can help.
Do any of the centralised Bitcoin based financial organisations offer compensation in case of failure?
If there is a major Bitcoin failure is the value likely to fall in the same way a fiat currency would upon a bank failure?
Are the answers to the above questions irrelevant because we all know what happens if a currency fails (incuding fiat) - the value drops and you still lose?
A currency is inherently worthless unless it is measured against something that retains a value regardless of economic conditions e.g. land, property, precious metals etc. etc.
What is Bitcoin measured against? - honestly I don't know the answer to this...

It's just human nature
This sub is great for finding out about Bitcoin. Lots of resources and useful stuff.
It tends to get a little serious when there are discussions about changing the way bitcoin works. Many don't want to upset or break the apple cart just in case it affects the price. Others realise that the apple cart must be changed, made bigger, have more wheels etc, in order to protect it and keep it moving forward.
I like reading this sub and bct..... lots of fun watching the discussions play out.

You can technically still mine with a normal computer. In fact this is what the original developers had in mind when the coin was created - that everyone can create new Bitcoins with ordinary computers.
To quote Gavin Andresen in 2010 "Bitcoin is the first peer-to-peer currency - it is money created by people instead of by a central bank or government"
This is no longer true and now mining Bitcoin profitably involves spending a lot of money on hardware or rented mining resources and is now the realm of the rich. Ordinary people, with ordinary hardware can no longer gain Bitcoins by "solo" mining  you must join one of the few large centralised mining pools if you want to get any by mining alone. The few mining pools out there use the collective power of miners to create new Bitcoins and hold the rest of the network to ransom by incuding transactions in the new Bitcoin blocks when they feel it is profitable to do so.
To be honest with the kind of computer you mention you would be better off getting a few scraps of dust from the tables of the rich on Bitcoin faucets (use Google to search for them).
If you really want Bitcoins, use the Euro to buy Bitcoins on an exchange and hope the value goes up.
@_date: 2015-12-08 20:39:04
So double the fee to get your transaction confirmed?
Heh.... miners really control this coin. Soon you will have to pay $5 to get a transaction sent.... oops sorry that's fiat (or is it?)

I used to maintain a full node and would be happy to do so again if there was an incentive to do so. I appreciate that maintaining a full node is good for the blockchain and therefore good for me but I get no reward for using energy doing so whilst many richer people than me just use multibit or electrum type products.
I now run full nodes for two or three choice altcoins that at least give me periodic POS rewards for doing so.
There needs to be an incentive for running a node. Some form of voluntary donation into a pool by miners or mining groups that is then split between registered nodes based on the time they stay online.

What can yet another altcoin offer the world?
Bitcoin itself must change and adapt. There are already competitor altcoins (not clones) just waiting in the wings. If Bitcoin cannot change users will move value elsewhere.

You've won me over
I just like to play "what if" sometimes - I leads to good collaboration, discussion and consensus
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:01:21
I agree this is what should and most probably will happen - one will be the "winner" in terms of being the "official" blockchain but only when agreement has been achieved..... what if that takes a long time or is never achieved? You are assuming here that there is a clear winner very quickly from the point of fork. What if a number of exchanges, merchants etc. decide to run two bitcoin chains old and new and get the benefit of both?
There could just as easily be an "official" blockchain that probably will have the most miners, difficulty etc. But what if a subset also wanted to run an "unofficial" blockchain as a secondary point of profit and commerce? Don't forget bitcoin is not centrally controlled and is very mature and well formed as is stands - technically this could remain in place as an alternative to the "preferred" chain.

@_date: 2015-06-10 06:09:16
This is the correct assessement of the situation to a point.
There is a scenario where the two blockchains continue to be used and mined into the future and regardless of the value of either. The world then ends up with two versions of bitcoin - the hard forked version being an alternative or "altcoin" of the original. In this scenario everyone who has coins now and controls their private keys will have coins on both chains and therefore spendable on both chains.
The nature of a free market is such that profit is maximised so it is more likely that we will end up with two versions of bitcoin as more money can be made this way.

You are absolutely right..... then greed and increasing centralisation took over !!!
Bitcoin is now effectively controlled by a few individuals and companies. 
The statements in this article attracted me to cryptocurrency and bitcoin in particular
Imagine my surprise when I realised you can't create bitcoins unless you can afford expensive mining hardware. This effectively excludes most of the worlds population from bitcoin and for that reason it will not be bitcoin that changes the world.
The cryptocurrency of the future, for general purpose use, must and will be capable of being created and used by a significant portion of the worlds population with meagre amounts of computing resources.
Don't get me wrong, bitcoin will still exist and be valuable as a store of wealth for the rich.... so there's no need for existing holders to worry.

I would say current cryptocurrency models are more at the level of the Babbage Difference Engine rather than comparable to the internet in the early 90's
They are basic, limited in scope, 2 dimensional and unlikely to meet expectations within their current scope of operation.
The next generation of currencies will be the real game changers....
However the principle of cryptocurrency is the important factor and this is like pandoras box - now it is open it can never be reversed.

So where is the spare hash going?
I expect it is going to other sha256 coins in order to try and cover costs?
@_date: 2014-12-16 08:31:09
To be honest I see where Luke-Jr is coming from and certainly it will provoke discussion in the community. Unfortunatley there may be no real answer either until consensus is acheived on the best way forward - what that will be we don't know yet but there are some real innovators out there who will put forward proposals that will either be accepted or rejected accordingly.
My feelings are that transaction processing needs fundamentally rebuilding to compete effectively against traditional online transactions, remove reliance on miners and speed up confirmation times. My thoughts are of a transaction blockchain running parallel to the main blockchain with no or minimal coin value, 5s block generation times and run by maintained and redundant nodes (possibly with spare mining hashes) for transaction fees only.

Faucets are a good start. Once you've accumulated enough to cashout then send to an exchange and make more trading altcoins.

10x or 20x or whatever the decision is that's fine. The main point is that smaller chunks of data in a stream are more easily transmitted than larger blocks and placed more easily on storage. To be honest it may be better to look at compression methods as well.

I think the focus is blockchain technology and not necessarily Bitcoin itself.
Financial institutions know that they can't control cryptocurrencies but they can convert fiat / financial services over to blockchain based tech esp as it's all open source. Still doesn't change the centrally controlled nature of fiat systems and all the problems associated with them - so roll on de-centralised crypto....

Why argue about block size - move to another more suitable coin instead. You just need to move to one that isn't a satoshi clone.

@_date: 2015-05-22 07:24:20
I like your thoughts - bitcoiners are so snobbish, self centered and self obsessed. Satoshi gave the world a beta example of what a blockchain can do and called it bitcoin. There are others out there taking the blockchain principle and improving on the idea and in some cases not even using satoshi code - for this they should be applauded and not abused.

This is why off chain transaction providers will never work / be trusted... they are too open to abuse within a decentralised economy.

Well done
I got rid of my BTC some time ago. There are much better developed cryptocurrencies out there now.
Bitcoin is an inflexible dinosaur and can only slowly adapt to change (if at all). There are only three reasons it still survives
1. It was the first and therefore has an emotional hold over many people
2. The amount of real money invested by people thinking they could get rich quick and still holding in the hope it will go back to $1000 again.
3. Big business investing in mining farms again in the hope of gettting rich or even controlling it.
Eventually people will cut their losses and dump it in favor of more innovative currencies. At this point the cost of mining will be too excessive and miners will shut up shop.
Cryptocurrency and the blockchain has a real future but not through bitcoin. Bitcoin lit the way but ultimately it will be consigned to history whilst better currencies take over.
@_date: 2015-05-05 12:27:08
Bitcoin turns fiat?
Sorry but bitcoin sounds more and more like a fiat, government controlled, for big business benefit currency every day.

There is a relationship in the economic sense - it's down to supply and demand
Over production of oil due to new oil fields, tapering off of demand and Iraq now selling again means that supply is way up meaning price drops -  beyond a certain point oil companies have to put more on the market in the short term to pay for running costs triggering even more price drops. 
Bitcoins are being mined by companies that have to pay their mining costs, this means they dumped some reserves into the market in an attempt to keep running as running costs have increased. The knock on effect is too many bitcoins for demand and the price dropped. They over dumped and the price dropped too far and triggered this despair phase we are seeing.
Good news is that it won't last for ever.... prices will rise again :)
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:43:03
My thoughts as well... but theres no harm in looking at ways to optimise things while you are at it. In my book if a hard fork is needed then you may as well make things as efficient as possible.
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:04:31
There is another way.....
Reduce the block reward by 10x and decrease the block time target by 10x
Result = 10x as many transactions can be processed in the same amount of time as the old block reward / block time target because 10x as many blocks get created. Also has the added bonus of speeding up confirmation times.

Still can't understand why it would take so much time to decide what to do?
Most of the changes needed are already developed and tested (in the altcoin world) and open source to Bitcoin.
Blocksize scaleability
Zero conf transactions
Node incentives
All done, dusted and operational - the devs just need to adapt for Bitcoin and plan a fork
Get your act together guys - get yourselves a decent project manager, plan, develop and deploy !!!
If you don't do it and carry on "discussing" you will become the Yahoo of the cryptocurrency world and another coin will take over as cryptocurrency of choice.
Most people have no opinion as long as Bitcoin works. Devs are relied upon do the decision making for them and investing time and effort as needed to maintain their status. If you can't do this then defer to someone who can.
@_date: 2015-08-17 06:43:46
Sorry, I'm out. I don't want to be part of a community that is censored in the way you have described.
Bitcoin is no longer what it was supposed to be. I has been effectively censored, centrally controlled and has had rules imposed upon it that were not part of the original vision.
Bitcoin itself is an old lumbering dinosaur. Ground breaking - yes it was. But it is now unable to adapt. If it was a new coin today is would fail and crash just like most of the other cryptocurrencies out there.
I am now moving out of bitcoin and wish this community well. If XT looks like moving back towards what Bitcoin was supposed to be, I will buy back in to that coin as an alternative.

But isn't everyone in cryptocurrency a scammer, thief or drug dealer?
The statement above is a bit tongue in cheek but a real perception that I see everytime I talk to people in general about cryptocurrency. 
Don't get me wrong, I believe in blockchain technology and p2p distributed cryptocurrency but this kind of headline, although very much needed, does not help matters.
Perception is everything and Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general will not succeed in its aims until this image is changed.
How this can be done? I don't know, but there are some very talented people amongst this community that can / must come together to change things for the better.

Bitcoin is only for the rich elite in the so called "developed" world. Most people in the world who just simply can't afford to buy bitcoin never mind have a bank account. If you were earning 1$ per day or less what would you spend it on?
For bitcoin (or cryptocurrency in general) it must be adoptable by everyone in the world and then it will make a real difference.

I thought it would be ready to deploy by now, especially considering the money spent.
If a lowly altcoin already has this in place, fully decentralised and operational for months now,  and for next to no cost - why can't a coin with the resources of bitcoin do this?
