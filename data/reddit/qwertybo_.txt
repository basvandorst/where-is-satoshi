Have you ever heard of cold storage?

I hope you know there’s plenty of people out here that still have well over hundreds of coins, thousands. Plenty of us that post here frequently. Not everyone here “invests” into bitcoin to make money but actually use it as it was intended.

You realize that bitcoin is useable as a currency? You think we just quit our jobs because we have bitcoin? I work my job, pay my bills, and make purchases with bitcoin when I please. Or I could cash out and pay someone to do everything for me. No thanks, stick with your fiat, I’ll stick with my BTC.

Not sure why he got down voted because he isn't wrong. A lot of us have over hundreds of coins. The majority of you have all jumped on to this Bitcoin train within the past 4 years.

Good for you. I’ve had my coins for over 5 years now and I’m fine with the price. Who’s going to steal them, you? Don’t make me laugh.

I think he meant 10k.

Money is relative. Get over it. People have been using bitcoin for almost a decade now. That’s why it’s called a cryptoCURRENCY. I have been spending my BTC for quite a few years now. It’s an amazing thing when you don’t have to use any of your real money and save every dollar from your salary.

Because bitcoin is a currency created for purchase. I’ve been spending my bitcoins for years now. There was a time where you didn’t have you buy them you know.

I don’t. Money is relative. There are still people out there with hundreds of coins in their wallets, even thousands, that bought in before the last 4 years, mined them, even got them through selling something.
