Some casinos are suitable for this use.
WalletBit still exists.
BTC-e doesn't ask for verification.

Instawallet had the advantage that when you withdrew your money, the money you got was not directly linked to the money you put into Instawallet on the blockchain. Multibit/Electrum can't mix your coins with other people's in this way.

I sold out at $173, and then put the proceeds out as loans on Bitfinex. I would have been just fine, but because of the way Bitfinex works, they may be insolvent as a result of the mtgox shutdown. If that's the case, I'll be out more than $20,000.

If mtgox lag goes up beyond a certain amount, Bitfinex shuts down all MTgox order matching. This can leave you stuck in a margin position as the price moves against you. Bitfinex won't even try to submit a limit order to close your position until MtGox returns to normal.
Nobody seems to be willing to borrow Bitcoins for very much interest (the average according to their statistics page is about 4% APR). However, people are falling all over each other to borrow USD at anywhere between 300% and 1000% APR, compounded daily, because even at these ridiculous rates, your dollar loans would still not perform as well as Bitcoin has for the past few months. 
I converted some of my funds to USD to try to take advantage of these rates in February and March, only to watch Bitcoin zip upwards at a rate equivalent to 3000%-5000% a year. What I projected the loans would make in a month, Bitcoin would have made it in a week. I figured it was just a brief spike, and then it did it again the next week, and the next week after that, until I decided to just hold bitcoins.
This could be a low-risk way to get in on the rising price for someone who hasn't bought in.
The Bitfinex USD interest rate could also serve as a barometer of sorts. I'd bet a bearish BTC market would bring with it low USD interest and high BTC interest.
