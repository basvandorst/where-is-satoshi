Nobody said the energy companies are complaining, nor did anybody say the energy companies want them out of the country.

Exactly. And even in it's most literal sense, "cash" is legal tender in physical form. So—Bitcoin is now somehow legal tender? And it's physical?

1. PayPal was one of the first payment processing services to accept Bitcoin.
2. Given that the question includes both Bitcoin and crypto, and for the vast majority of people on this planet the two words are synonymous, it's probably safe to assume he's referring to cryptoCURRENCIES like Bitcoin and Litecoin. It's the dominant cryptocurrency for a reason.
EDIT: Upon closer inspection — The article absolutely provides both of the quotes you copy and pasted, in full, in proper context. There is nothing misleading about it. The only thing you could dispute is that he's not talking specifically about Bitcoin. However, it only makes senses that he's referring to both. Would you prefer the headline read "Bitcoin and Cryptos Success...?"
