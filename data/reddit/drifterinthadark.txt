You can just ask Alexa the price of bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, etc. You don't need an extra skill, though I'm unsure just how many cryptocurrencies it knows.

Very same people? I doubt it. There is more than just the hivemind. Yes, whoever claimed to despise regulation and is now trying to use that same government for regulation against Mt Gox are hypocrites, but most people who want their money back or are threatening legal action aren't the same ones that claim anarchy is ideal.

This is a pathetic amount of socking. I hope they're exposed real quick, this sort of behavior isn't permissible on reddit. As far as I'm concerned, changetip can fuck off and I don't want anything to do with them.

pounds. Was a MAJOR shit.

Nope....nothing you're really missing. You kinda missed the boat on the time in which a normal PC can generate any worthwhile coins. There was a time where it would only take minutes or hours for a normal quadcore PC, but now you would need to setup your PC as a miner for anything worthwhile.  
At this point, the easiest way for most people to get bitcoins is to buy them somehow, or figure something to trade for it.

I'm not saying it isn't staged, it certainly could be, but it doesn't "have to be staged" because of a $150 silver bar. You saying he wouldn't give away a silver bar made it sound like it's 10 oz ounce of gold rather than 10 oz silver.

Also, the Silk Road shut down. Guess it brought bitcoin into the news again and made people a little more comfortable when bitcoin bounced back when so many thought it was reliant on silk road usage.

Heaven forbid ONE exchange has a little downtime. Expand to other markets, people.

10 Oz of silver is ~$150. Not saying that is cheap for someone to give away, but certainly not enough to break a bank on a youtube video that got over 2.5 million views.

They'll definitely be interested but it still doesn't mean their piece will be well-researched and informative. I used to watch TYT a little bit, in fact I think I was the first one to bring bitcoins up to them probably two years ago. Their reporting is just too shallow to follow frequently though. I guess more interest in bitcoin certainly doesn't hurt, though.
