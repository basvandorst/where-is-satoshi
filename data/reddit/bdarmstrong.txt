Wow! This is the first time someone on has actually linked to our vault that I can remember. Thank you :) My life is now complete.
Don't forget we have a multisig vault where you can control your own keys also (no trust of Coinbase required)   This product is surprisingly popular. I think it is one of the most popular multisig options being used today in all bitcoin and it almost never gets mentioned here.
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:59:36
Yes - I use all products in the space to learn about them.
I actually think BC.I is a much better product than people here give it credit for.
One thing people don't realize is that issues you see with products are often caused by how successful they are (slow support, transaction delays, scaling challenges). The least successful products don't have these challenges.

Our target average time to resolution for support tickets is 24 hours, but during periods when there are a large number of inquiries (like right now given recent events!) we don't always hit this and it has been closer to 48 hours recently (others from Coinbase support can add more detail here).
I understand the temptation to come here to reddit and complain loudly (or embellish - disappeared!!) to get attention. But it does not help us respond to everyone's inquiries faster, nor is it fair to other people who are waiting for a response for you to try and jump the line.
We get many thousands of support inquiries per week. If 1% of all people come here to do this, there will be 50 or 100 posts like this a week.

These post headlines are taking hyperbole to a whole new level.
I think what you mean is that we closed your account because you are living in a country where we don't operate, and there is a bug on our close account page. In addition our support team has been slow to provide you a solution. None of those things are good, but there is no reason to lie and say we took $12,000 from you.
We should have a fix out for you shortly for the bug you encountered, and apologies for the poor experience you had.

Coinbase CEO here. I wanted to take the opportunity to address this. Circle is a really well done product and I have nothing but good things to say about them. So lets start with that.
Second, most companies in the digital currency space are not profitable right now. Coinbase is not, and I would venture to guess that there are few others out there who are. In the short term this is totally fine. This is why we raised venture capital (and many great tech companies are not profitable until later in their cycle). But it is also not sustainable forever. We've invested many millions of dollars in building a foundational piece of infrastructure for the digital currency industry (secure, trusted exchange). Our investors did not do this to subsidize the digital currency industry out of generosity, they did it to help jump start the industry (and hopefully make a return).
The industry needs rock solid infrastructure to enable people to convert their local currency into and out of digital currency. To build this well costs money. We spend a lot of money on things like security audits, compliance, understanding the laws of each country where we operate, obtaining regulatory licenses around the world, great engineering, and many more mundane areas like lunches for employees (there is a competitive market to hire the best people out there).
Coinbase is not trying to make a quick flip and sell to a bigger company. We are playing for the long term. We are planning to grow revenues from this initial service we've built, continues scaling it around the world, and then invest that money in new projects that will help the world move to an open financial system. This will take 10+ years. Customers have shown an incredible willingness to pay for the service we've created because there is demand for it, and they recognize that this will help digital currency be more successful.
The beautiful thing about free markets is that if someone can do what we're doing cheaper or better then this creates competition in the market. We should be subject to this as well. But it's important not to confuse companies operating at a loss in the short term with what a sustainable business looks like.
Finally, I don't have full information on this but my impression as an outsider is that Circle is moving away from bitcoin (their homepage doesn't mention it at all) and they are building something like Venmo on a more global scale, with primarily fiat currencies. This is just my impression as an outsider and could be incorrect. Coinbase is committed to supporting the exchange of bitcoin (and other digital currencies) as our primary business, and we'd like to help 100M+ people over the coming years do this.
If you imagine getting into digital currency as a one time thing (and then you operate in a crypto-to-crypto world after that), then the difference between 1% or 1.49% is negligible, especially when the volatility of digital currency is still high, and your gain/loss over just a week or two could make this fee seem insignificant. In other cases where people immediately cash out to their local currency (such as in our merchant tools) we offer different pricing.
Hopefully this helps share some perspective on the subject.
@_date: 2016-08-01 17:04:26
You can audit it to ensure we are not doing that now (with tools like wireshark, I believe). There is no good way I'm aware of to ensure we will never do this in the future. But this is true for any software that you update (mobile apps, web apps, even desktop software). You in theory would need to continually audit each update to ensure it is not doing that. It still provides a nice deterrent though.
@_date: 2016-08-01 06:20:02
You are correct - the recent slow downs are from us doing cold storage restores from offline. We keep a pretty small % of funds in the hot wallet at any given time (both for BTC and ETH).

If you prefer to control your own private keys we also offer an option for this and many users take advantage of it:
  This doesn't require you to trust Coinbase at all.
I personally use many options to store my own bitcoin (there are a bunch of good products in the space). I use CoPay, BreadWallet, and Blockchain.info to name a few. There are many ways now to store your own private keys (including Coinbase). Coinbase is primarily an exchange, and not a wallet:
@_date: 2016-08-09 21:41:41
I'll add an additional answer here: there is nothing wrong with using Coinbase as an exchange and transferring your digital currency off site afterwards. We don't make money on storage, we make it on exchange. Some people find it more convenient to store it with us but you certainly don't have to. Btw you can also use our multisig vault if you want to be in full control of the keys 
@_date: 2016-08-31 22:08:24
Because I think there will be many winners in the digital currency space.
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:33:45
1. Our goal is to be transparent on fees. You might want to check what spread Circle is charging you.
2. Our limits go up to $250 at launch (will be higher in the future). Some are lower based on risk scores.
3. This is true at launch (we're doing a phased roll out).
4. Fair point (I haven't confirmed it myself though)
5. Fair point (I haven't confirmed it myself though)
Thank you for the feedback overall!

Coinbase CEO here. FWIW I have never heard of the The Trans-Pacific Partnership, and to my knowledge we haven't signed any letters supporting it.
We're a member of the Internet Association along with a bunch of companies: 
@_date: 2015-12-04 09:02:49
Coinbase CEO here. Thank you for the comments! This was a breath of fresh air and everyone on the team really appreciated it.
I must say it is often challenging reading the hate, but we've developed thick skin over the years. And I think it's good there is a vocal community to keep us honest.
Btw, to answer your questions on the cancelled purchases, we don't have any exposure when the price moves (we own the bitcoin you purchased within a fraction of a second either way when you click buy). The reason you see cancelled purchases is that (like every online business who does this - Paypal, etc) we see lots of fraudsters trying to use stolen cards/bank accounts etc to buy bitcoin, and when this happens we cover the cost. When you charge a 1% fee, it takes 100 good purchases to make up for just one fraudulent one. Most people who have never worked on this problem before have zero concept of how difficult it is to combat at scale (it is one of the biggest reasons so few companies have been able to stay in business doing what we do). There are a bunch of complex systems (machine learning) and talented people behind the scenes who work to get this right, and you never achieve 100% accuracy. Let's say, for example, that you accurately predicted 99 out of 100 buys (whether they were fraudulent or not), which would be pretty good. This would still means that dozens or hundreds of people every week would see cancelled buys. I'm not surprised that people don't get it, I had no idea myself until working in this area at a prior job.
Overall, thank you for the support!

I think ChangeTip did a good job with their integration: 
A few things I thought could be improved. (1) instead of the slash command this uses a bot which has permission to do more things, like message the user who received the tip if they are brand new (2) it implements other commands like deposit/withdraw/leaderboard/etc and (3) this adds support for tipping via emoji reactions, which I think is lower friction and kind of cool.
Both integrations support USD tipping.
The goal here is to help the ecosystem move forward and get more bitcoin adoption (I think we all share that goal). This is free, open source software. Anyone is welcome to copy it or improve on it.
Edit: it also gives 100 bits to every user the first time they interact with the bot, so it is super low friction to do your first few tips (helps with adoption).

No tutorial needed, sign up for Coinbase and visit

Off blockchain is still the best way to do tipping I think - zero transaction fees. And put it on chain once you've accumulated a large enough amount and want to withdraw.

**Ok - I'll bite (I'm the Coinbase CEO)**
Thank you for taking a deep breath and wondering what the reason behind this might be.
First, I can't imagine any reason why those two events (finding an exploit and being 'banned') would be connected. So I'd guess they are totally unrelated.
Second, we should be clear what 'banning' means. The implication here is that we've prevented someone from withdrawing their bitcoin, which I don't think happened. You can read our stated policy on it here: 
The only time that would happen is if we receive a court order specifically requiring us to freeze access to your bitcoin. We wouldn't do it on our own. In more than 99% of cases 'banning' means that you still have the ability to withdraw your bitcoin, we just can't continue to provide you with Coinbase services. So if you really couldn't withdraw your bitcoin, it either means (1) a court is very unhappy with you and compelled us to do that (2) we've made an egregious error which goes against our stated policy or (3) you are mistaken and you can in fact withdraw your bitcoin.
We'll have to take a look at why this account may have been banned in the coming weeks to see if the right call was made or if it was an error. Please understand we generally can't reply back here on Reddit with an exact reason why a user was banned (it would violate a customer's privacy, and in some cases disclose something we can't disclose about how our internal operations work). I can say that in the past whenever someone has taken to reddit to blast us, and we've gone back to look, 9 out of 10 times the correct decision was made to ban. I can understand why people would be unhappy about it, but an exchange is regulated very differently than a pure bitcoin-to-bitcoin wallet.
I can't really speak to the bug bounty payouts without taking a closer look. We get dozens of reports a week and we aren't always perfect at triaging them to make the right call. Also, sometimes if multiple people report the same vuln we only pay out the first.
Finally, thank you for being a security researcher - we've benefitted enormously from the awesome security community over the past three years and it pains me to think we might damage our relationship there in some way.
Someone from Coinbase will follow up with you with more detail in the next week to see if we can make things right.

Brian from Coinbase here.  The BitLicense is only a proposal at the moment, and I would hope this is one area that does not make it through to a final version.  But in the event it does, your suggestion makes sense about designating a beneficiary.  I suspect many people will also name a beneficiary in their will, which we will have to develop a process to deal with.
Don't forget, in the current version of our vault  you can have multiple approvers as well, so if someone passes away, a quorum of remaining signers on the account could withdraw the funds. This is interesting, but only a partial solution (since many people will have funds in a wallet or individual vault also).  Anyway, your main point is well taken.
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:33:53
**Brian from Coinbase here.**  If you'd like to control your own keys you can do this today on Coinbase through our paper wallets: 
We will be rolling out multi-sig support for the vault in the near future as well.
We've seen non-technical people struggle with storing their own keys (and it can be quite dangerous without careful diligence) so we think our vault product (which handles all security and backups for you) is going to be the safer option for most people.  However, we completely recognize that a large number of users like yourself prefer more control, so we've put a big effort into offering those options as well.
tl;dr - you can store your own keys on Coinbase today, and we hope to make it even easier in the future

This is true - you are not anonymous on Coinbase.
You do however, have full control of bitcoin in your multisig vault.  (And a number of other features that not being anonymous gets you, like the ability the buy and sell bitcoin by connecting your local bank account). This is the trade off.

Good suggestion - we'll incorporate this into the next version (been working on one for a while).

That particular issue you encountered wasn't intentional, just a mistake.

Brian from Coinbase here.
We restrict some countries based on request by Wikipedia.  In addition, Coinbase is unavailable in the following countries due to U.S. law: Iran, Syria, Sudan, North Korea, and Cuba.
This is true of all U.S. based companies and is not unique to Coinbase or Wikipedia.  You can read here for more info: 
The beautiful thing about bitcoin is that as an open system and there can be wallet providers all over the world.  If you are in one of those countries Coinbase can't help but there are lots of great wallet providers out there.  You may still be unable to donate to Wikipedia however, based on their own restrictions.

Small clarification here: Coinbase only does off blockchain on transactions below a certain threshold (we've used 0.25 and 0.10 in the past) to try and minimize the fees we pay on behalf of our customers.
But there are certainly a lot which fit in this category.
@_date: 2014-12-16 17:44:29

@_date: 2014-10-29 18:22:45
Important to note that the group vault (2 of 3 or 3 of 5) solves this case, since the attacker would have had to compromise multiple computers while you were setting up the vault.
For large amounts of bitcoin, the group vault is definitely a more secure option since one (or more in the case of 3 of 5) people can get completely compromised and the bitcoin is still safe.

There seems to be a lot of crazy downvoting on these posts, so I am testing another one.

Edit: bold formatting
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:17:35
Brian from Coinbase here.  It is nothing serious, but annoying, and is a result of people spamming 1 satoshi outputs to tons of addresses.  Essentially when they spam one of our hot wallet addresses we incorrectly label it as "Restoring from Hot Wallet". If you try to spend (or sell) those coins the transaction will fail because the coins will never confirm.
We are currently working on a fix and hope to have it cleared up by tomorrow.

I feel like "documentaries" like this (in quotes, because that term has been abused by lots of people to really mean opinion piece) are doing a disservice to bitcoin and hurting mainstream adoption.  Even if you agree with the ideas contained within it (and many do), it doesn't help to spout them with this sort of revolutionary drama and intense music.  If you actually are silently sparking a revolution, how does it benefit you to loudly rub it in the face of the people you are trying to disrupt?
Bitcoin is just like the internet, a technology that will bring benefits to various groups of people (individuals, businesses, even governments). It is a tool for positive change, not a weapon designed to hurt any group of people.  If you want bitcoin to go mainstream, there is no reason to scare average people who don't fully understand it yet with talk of revolutions. They aren't ready to hear that, and they are less likely to join your side when seeing it.
There is probably room for a thoughtful documentary out there about how bitcoin is being used by political activists, but the tone of it should probably be bit more like national geographic or planet money, and not this.
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:05:26
This is a great idea. I gave a talk at Reddit's office a month or two ago where I proposed this idea to them. I haven't seen much interest from them unfortunately. (Not sure if there are employees there who agree it should be tried). Trying it in the forum first seems to make sense.
@_date: 2015-05-07 05:16:39

Coinbase supports multisig vaults that let you control your own private keys.

We've also supported paper wallets since 2013 but the multisig vault is better/newer in my view.
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:02:29
I think we've made this really easy on Coinbase: 
Step-by-step wizard, all in the browser, and at the end you have a real multi-sig wallet where you control the keys.
If you already have a Coinbase account go here  and click "New Account", then "Vault".

Charlie Lee (coblee) gets a lot of credit for helping get it worked out.

Also, random idea. Do you want to get on a skype call or phone call and talk this out? I feel like it might help us understand each other.

We don't have a CTO at Coinbase, and never have. I see this get mistaken at times. You might be thinking of Charlie Lee, who is a Dir of Eng at Coinbase. I trust his judgement on this and listen lots. We agree on most things (although obviously we aren't a mirror image of each other). I consider him a subject matter expert, along with a number of other people, who I like to get advice from on this topic.
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:04:19
This is a pretty misleading title. In your description you contradict it yourself - we ARE allowing you to transfer out your coins (just not continue to use our exchange).
Second, our support replied once in 24 hours? That seems reasonable to me.
Third, we have a procedure where you can withdraw the coins yourself. Can you think of any reason why we might not allow people to email customer support with a bitcoin address to withdraw all their coins?
@_date: 2017-02-11 00:14:03

Yep, they were one of the first merchants to integrate with Coinbase back in August 2013.

@_date: 2016-01-12 00:52:22
Theymos I'm happy to give you an official answer as best I can.
**Coinbase will always support the longest valid chain in bitcoin.** Actually lets say longest valid chain where valid is an economic majority. We would never want to prevent our customers from using their bitcoin, forcing them on to a shorter chain or do anything like that (it would be a terrible decision that could hurt everything we've built at the company). I'm sort of surprised anyone thought we would really do this, I didn't think it was even worth mentioning.
We run four different types of nodes in the production, so XT is just one we were experimenting with. Coblee is right that we need to *experiment* with many node types to ensure we can continue to serve our customers, even in the event a hard fork were to occur (obviously, a hard fork is not up to us, even if people think we have a vote). Btw, it is worth mentioning that even if people thought we were running 100% on XT (which we weren't) this would still not have moved us off the longest chain in bitcoin (XT requires 70% consensus on blocks mined, I believe). I probably should have explained this better so people didn't misinterpret it.
Our opinions may be different on how to scale bitcoin, but hopefully you no longer have concerns about Coinbase moving off of bitcoin. We will always support the longest chain. Does this help? If not let me know. Thanks.

I basically agree with what Erik wrote in this thread. I'm not pro BU (or pro anyone). I'm pro decentralization and choice. I'm neutral on who "wins" (whatever that means).


I don't think you read what I wrote. I said:
"If there is overwhelming support from **miners and users** around any new version of the software (regardless of who wrote it), then I think that will be called Bitcoin (or BTC)." Throw in economic nodes there also if you like.
@_date: 2016-01-12 05:24:22
Thanks! Clarified.
@_date: 2016-06-03 16:51:18
Is all the FUD really necessary?
1. yes what I wrote in the blog post is true
2. not all cold storage uses multisig, we also use key splitting as described here 
3. we have done financial audits (which our investors are privy to) which demonstrate proof of reserves
4. in addition, here is one we did publicly a long time ago 
Finally, the most important point is that if you want to store your bitcoin in a way that does not require any trust of Coinbase at all, you can do so on Coinbase with our multi-sig vault! 
I understand you're upset, but before jumping to conclusions, making outlandish claims, and criticizing me personally, please consider that you may not have full information and there may be a much simpler, reasonable explanation.

So for buys Coinbase was cheaper right now.
@_date: 2017-01-18 00:04:00
This is great! We are looking to go through more of these that were incorrectly closed as we scaled up. It was really difficult to keep a handle on everything as we grew to millions of customers accounts ove the last few years with a relatively small team, but we're trying to go back now and take a fresh look at accounts where we made mistakes. Please contact support if you feel we should take a fresh look at your account (fair warning: it may take a week or more for us to reply but we will get to it).

You are a smart person.
@_date: 2016-06-03 21:09:54
Our support rep misunderstood the difference between multi-sig and key splitting using shamir's secret sharing, and updated their post to reflect that. It is an easy mistake to make, the distinction is quite subtle and I would guess most people don't fully understand the difference.
Both are potential options for storing funds offline with their own pros and cons. Multisig has the benefit of the keys never being generated all in one place. Key splitting requires you to generate keys in a secure environment, but allows you to use higher numbers for M and N which is beneficial.
Our cold storage uses key splitting for a variety of reasons (one of them being the pro I mentioned above) but Coinbase also allows customers to create multisig vaults where they are in full control of their private keys 
We count both of these in our numbers around helping people store bitcoin. Hopefully this clears things up and apologies for any confusion.
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:45:47
You're right - the fees are getting a bit complex (and high) across all the different payment methods and countries. Sorry about that. We're working on a simplified fee structure which we're hoping to roll out in Q3. And battling the fraudsters out there to ensure we are covering our costs with each payment method.
@_date: 2016-06-03 16:54:12

This remains one of the biggest misconceptions about Coinbase, especially amongst the crowd.
**You can be 100% in control of your private keys on Coinbase.** This is even linked/described in the original post on this page.

You are correct. Our multi-sig vault keeps users in control of their own keys, and we even offer a recovery mechanism (if Coinbase were to disappear):

People should be aware, we are testing this with 3D Secure enabled credit cards only right now, which are much more common in UK/Europe (although some U.S. Banks support it also).

This is definitely why we created Coinbase. To make it easy for people to buy bitcoin, and store it securely. They can then graduate from there as they get more technical, but this is a great gateway drug (and the buying/selling part is useful forever, no matter what wallet you ultimately end up choosing).

Hi, CEO of coinbase.com here.  I think you're right and while we don't claim to be invincible, we're taking some big steps in this direction.
I put up an FAQ page here.  There is a lot more we need to do before taking the beta label off the site:  
If you have any thoughts please email me, brian at our domain dot com.  We'll be having some white hate firms audit the security in the next few months and might even do a crowded sourced attack putting some coins up for grabs (a bounty, if you will).

Toshi is the v2 to the node I wrote (Toshi was written by several engineers on our team). The v1 node I wrote is baked into a monolithic app which still forms the core of Coinbase (and is slowly being broken into many different services). We still use the v1 node today, in addition to several other nodes, but I imagine/hope it will be phased out entirely over time as we move to more of an SOA. Long story short, it was never open sourced.
@_date: 2012-08-01 10:08:03
We're working hard on that last part.  Thanks!
@_date: 2012-08-01 10:01:19
Bad ass - thanks for the kind words!
@_date: 2016-02-22 17:45:57
This part sort of rubbed me the wrong way.


I'm one of the more vocal advocates for bringing in other teams to compete with core, and I think I can safely say that I understand the inside of bitcoin. I've written a bitcoin node from scratch (the same one that grew to power millions of people's wallets on Coinbase) and have a masters degree in CS.
I think there is a big difference between the more academic computer science researchers in this area (of which there are maybe dozens in the world who are qualified/interested) and software engineers who could build a high quality node (of which there are probably tens of thousands). Google alone probably employees several thousand of the latter (at least).
@_date: 2012-08-01 10:00:56
Awesome, thanks for the feedback!  We've gotten a few requests for Google Authenticator.  Were you not a fan of the Authy app or just another app to install was annoying when you already have one setup?  The reason we chose it over Google Authenticator is it also handles tokens to SMS based cells phones (which are less secure, but we still wanted to provide the option for those without smartphones, which is still the majority of users in the world).
The key export would be a cool option I think down the road.  As for getting hacked, we considered the client side encryption route but found it too limiting in making a mass market product (can't do a forgotten password option, or auto billing options, subscription products, etc).  I think what we'll end up doing instead is keeping 95% of funds in cold storage and then getting an insurance policy on the rest.  We don't have this setup yet so while we're still in beta we don't recommend keeping large balances on Coinbase.  It's a trade off for sure, but we think this is a better route to build a product for non-technical users.  Most of you folks on redditare probably tech-saavy :)  But at least that was our thought process...
@_date: 2012-08-01 10:25:25
Awesome thanks for the feedback!
3. We'll list it more publicly once we've got the office setup in San Francisco, totally agree
4. good point, sorry that was meant to refer to USD funding and withdrawal of your account, not bitcoin transactions, I'll reword it
5. great point, added some detail about miner fees
6. historical data from bitcoincharts, newer updates from a variety of exchanges (as you probably noticed, it's not meant to provide up to the minute detail or anything, just a general picture of how things are going, since we aren't really an exchange)
8. we have this built, but not pushed yet...should be out soon
9. we'll primarily be a web based wallet, and will partner with exchanges on the backend
10. yes...market price (updated more frequently than that though, just in case)
12. a valid request...this may not play nice with the cold storage solution we are pondering however - would it be sufficient to simply send your money to a new address when you wanted to withdraw it?  (I understand these are slightly different, but just curious)
13. built, and not launched yet, should be soon!
Thanks for the kind words, we'll keep working on it :)

This is a good point, and I think you're right to be wary of new services asking for this info.
We debated offering instant account verification for the reasons you mentioned, but we ultimately went with it for the following reasons:
- we don't store any bank credentials on our servers after the verification completes (or fails), and take care to filter it out of any logs etc
- it allows someone to verify an account and start buying bitcoin in just a few minutes instead of 2-3 days (lowers the hurdle to getting started)
- it's the default in the U.S. for services like Paypal so people are somewhat familiar with it
- for anyone who is uncomfortable with it, the challenge deposit verification is available to them (we make two small deposits to your account and ask you to verify the amounts, which take 2-3 days to arrive)
We'll continue to evaluate whether to keep it along with help from our lawyers, but just wanted to add some more details about how we thought about it.  Hope it helps.

@_date: 2012-08-01 10:07:27
Hmm, well let me tell you what we had in mind and you can tell me if you buy it.  Right now we are trying to abstract out this idea of fees from new bitcoin users.  I feel like it can be a little confusing to explain it up front (well is it low fees, or no fees?) and surprising to send or receive 1 btc and get back....0.9995 (woa!).
We may end up paying it their behalf down the road if our transactions aren't getting confirmed in a reasonable time, and absorb it as a cost of doing business.  But right now we only prompt the user about fees if they are sending &lt; 0.01 BTC.  Jury is still out on how long this strategy will last though.  General philosophy is that we're trying to make bitcoin a little less intimidating for new users, and this is one small way.
@_date: 2012-12-29 04:41:52
You should have just received an email informing you of the credits to your bank account.  The error was our fault - very sorry about that!

You don't need to upload two forms of ID if you're buying less than $3,000 a day. You do need to add a payment method (no way around that), but you can connect your bank account or credit card (wire transfer not required).
I'm wondering if you are thinking of true bitcoin exchanges (which are geared towards businesses and pro/semi-pro traders).  If it's someone's first experience with bitcoin, you should send them to a bitcoin wallet instead.
In fact, the easiest way to get them some bitcoin is to just send bitcoin to their email address.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:22:14
I'm totally fine if bitcoin stays bitcoin. I just want to let the community decide (miners, exchanges, etc).
To be fair, we did say "We may consider other factors such as market cap or community support to determine stability" in the announcement. Accumulated difficulty is just a nice leading indicator.
It sounds like we're saying the same thing - let the market decide. So what's the concern?

@_date: 2015-09-23 17:54:41
Tesla was awarded well over 200 patents before Elon musk blogged about open sourcing its IP (and they were a many billion dollar company at that time). Clearly their strategy was not to forego patent filing entirely, even if they ultimately intended to make a public commitment to open sourcing the IP. Coinbase is very open to making similar commitments in the future and we're considering options.
I'd say our strategies look pretty similar so far on the two timelines of the company. (you have to remember Coinbase is a much earlier stage company that Tesla).

No encryption for this release.  So exercise caution.  It's beta software after all and it's more likely to just crash than get stolen at this point.  I'd suggest testing with small amounts.
It is a full implementation of the protocol though (well 90% probably).  As another commenter pointed out, we're using the BitcoinJ library, and submitted some changes to it during development.
@_date: 2011-07-07 07:59:17
Yep I think 800 was already paid out.  We're hoping to get at least some of the rest though!
@_date: 2011-07-07 08:05:09
Yeah compiling from source might require some changes.  The Android Market link is here: 
We've noticed Google can take a while to update the market.  So if you just search for "bitcoin" you might not have seen it.  You can follow that direct link and click "Install" from your web browser to send it to your phone though (at least on Chrome).
@_date: 2011-07-07 08:14:45
Yep only 2 decimal places for the initial release.  Had not considered this!   :)
It's added as an issue here:

If only there was a way to get consensus from a decentralized group on the internet!
@_date: 2011-07-07 08:13:42
Hey!  We'd love to have you try it.  Sorry, the Market seems to be taking a while to update in some places.  If you click "Install" on this direct link it should send it to your phone (at least it does on Chrome when I'm logged into my Google account).
Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2011-07-07 07:59:32
No worries!
@_date: 2011-07-07 08:17:34
Hmm...the first time you run the app it has to update the blockchain, so it's best to be on WiFi for the first run.  Wonder if this was it?
Some details here: 
@_date: 2011-07-07 08:16:06
Good idea on the Dwolla.
Few details here: 
Basically BitcoinJ only stores block headers, so it's 14MB and we keep it on the phone's SD card.

Very cool, I like it!
@_date: 2011-07-07 08:17:46

Yep, in fact our app is based on the BitcoinJ library.
@_date: 2016-10-26 05:08:40
Yes, there is a major difference. Coinbase stores 98%+ of funds entirely offline, with geographically distributed shards that require multiple key holders to bring it back online. We also have insurance on our hot wallet 
Bitfinex had all (or most) funds online and no insurance.
Our security team did an AMA here

Awesome work, this seems really well done!

What does everyone think about as an alternative? It looks like Roger Ver is a mod so could be better.
@_date: 2015-03-28 20:55:54
Interesting - this is an unintended side effect of us giving 100 bits away for free (off blockchain), which launched this week.
We'll have to think of a better solution to this - sorry about that!
@_date: 2015-11-23 05:38:00
Coinbase CEO here. This is the right answer from my POV. If you get paid in bitcoin (I do) or you've bought a bunch of bitcoin over time that has gone up in value, it is a way for you to spend it anywhere you want. Or get cash out of ATMs (sell it). That is a relatively small group of people today, but meaningful for them.
I've been using my shift debit card over the past 3 months beta testing it, in the U.S. and various countries while traveling, and it is my primary card now. I used to just buy and hold bitcoin. Now I spend it every day.
It doesn't save you money (in fact could be worse than a rewards card), but if you're already bought in to bitcoin in a big way, then this makes it usable in every day life.
@_date: 2015-11-23 05:40:17
It is settled off chain - you are selling your bitcoin which happens internally on Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-10-18 02:43:11
No it would cost them 1 bit to downvote though (just like upvotes)
@_date: 2016-10-26 21:01:04
Coinbase CEO here - apologies for the delay.
We endeavor to keep a small % of bitcoin actually online in our hot wallet. This occasionally leads to delays when large amounts of funds move. In this case it was due to a single customer withdrawing the funds from their ICO.
The backed up transactions should be clearing out now. Sorry again for the trouble here. This is one of the conscious trade offs we make between security and how quickly funds can be restored from offline, there is definitely always room to improve these processes.
@_date: 2015-03-12 06:11:53
Great explanation - thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-28 20:55:09
Turns out it's tough to give away 100 bits for free without some controls in place. The early bitcoin faucets found the same thing.
But i hear you, it is not ideal.
@_date: 2011-07-17 21:43:14
- support for up to 8 decimal places
- progress window shows status downloading blocks and connecting to peers
- fixed (hopefully) two bug causing crash reports

Have you tried Coinbase's mulisig wallet? 
Genuinely curious if you don't like it for some reason. (I'm the CEO of Coinbase) It's true that the default wallet is a hosted wallet (which may be why?)
The way most people use Coinbase is that the regular hosted wallet is easy for day-to-day spending (like cash in your pocket), while the vault is for larger sums of money (like a vault in your home, or safe deposit box). And with the vault you can control your own keys. This seems like the right trade off to me, but curious what you think.
If your concern is privacy - you're correct that on Coinbase you are not anonymous. The trade off here is that you can convert bitcoin into/out of your local currency in 32 countries on Coinbase (connect a bank account). This is regulated activity, so you're not anonymous, but that is the trade off.
Anyway, we get a lot of negativity on so I've always wondered why. I think we're a good option for non-technical users, and offer multi-sig options for people to control their own keys.
@_date: 2015-10-20 03:20:54
 is the most popular wallet out there right now [1][2], largely because it is easy to use for non-technical people like yourself.
People here don't often mention it because it is a hosted wallet (meaning in a regular Coinbase wallet you don't control your own private keys). However, if you want to control your own private keys, you can use our vault product:  which is also the most popular one out there as far as we know (measured by deposits).
There is typically a trade off between ease of use and security. I think Coinbase offers a good trade off between the two - the hosted wallet is good for small amounts, and easy to spend day to day (sort of like the cash in your pocket). The vault is where you can store larger sums (and control your own keys if you want), more like a safe you might keep in your home.
Hope it helps.

I don't see any option to pay with bitcoin.  Maybe it is not available in the U.S.?
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:08:51
If you create a vault with multiple approvers (2 of 3 or 3 of 5) you can withdraw as quickly as you can get the approvers to approve a transaction.
The individual vault has a required 48 hour time delay because there is a security trade off (sometimes people get everything, phone, email, etc hacked) and the time delay is their best chance of recovering from this.

Coinbase CEO here.
We're happy to have our compliance team reach out to them if you'd like.  We have done this for some other customers, usually we can help clear things up with a phone call.

We don't have a marketing team to date (perhaps no surprise given your comment).  Marketing is tricky - my view on it is that if you are in the top ~5% of marketers, it is probably worth it.  The rest of companies probably lose money on it.  I'm not a marketing expert so I don't think I'd be able to tell the difference between those two people just yet (although we probably could with time). So we've decided to focus on our strengths (product, BD, etc) first. We've been focused on hiring other executives that are more urgent for us, but it wouldn't surprise me if we have a CMO eventually.
We can also start with baby steps.  We will have a store coming out soon that sells some Coinbase t-shirts and hoodies (for bitcoin of course).  I think they look pretty cool (and can be a bit more bitcoin focused than Coinbase focused).
@_date: 2015-11-12 07:13:43
Try creating a vault on Coinbase, I think it's the most user-friendly way to accomplish what people here are referring to. You can make it so two out of three signers on the account are required to withdraw, or three out of five.
(And yes, you can be in full control of the keys if you wish.)
@_date: 2015-03-16 04:54:52
Have to admit, this is a pretty outstanding way to describe it.  Congrats Wences!
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:04:30
I am not a lawyer. However, my understanding is all money service businesses (MSBs) in the U.S. are required to develop an effective AML program (which means transaction monitoring).  Customers in other countries could be under different laws.
So any hosted bitcoin wallet service in the U.S. is either doing transaction monitoring like we are or (arguably) breaking the law.
As for whether we try to track transactions **after** they are withdrawn to personal wallets, the answer is generally no. (I'm trying to think if there are any exceptions to that - MSBs who provide services to other MSBs have a requirement to also know their customer's customers, etc - we also might do some analysis if we believe people are trying to scam us by moving to a personal wallet and back to make it appear the accounts aren't linked, I would have to check).
But in general we don't do that.  In the link mentioned, that didn't have anything to do with tracking a transaction after it was sent to a personal wallet, and I'm not sure how they got that impression.
Hope it helps.

We use the  library which is open source.  It can be inspected in the web browser to see what is happening when keys are generated.
Caveat: I haven't tried this myself, so there might be some things we could do make it easier to verify.
Hope it helps.
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:12:49
This is correct.
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:09:56
Real Coinbase CEO here.  You're right, we should probably include a bitcoin address in those emails which go out.  I'm open to that.
This is mostly left over from a time where 99% of people receiving those messages had no idea what bitcoin or a bitcoin address where.  I wrote it back in 2012.  That has probably changed quite a bit at this point, although I still think it is the majority (maybe 80% of people receiving those messages now don't know what bitcoin is, or have any).
Let me see if we can fix that.

Just posted a similar note here: 
Hi Everyone, just wanted to post more details on what happened. This was a bug on our part.
We switch between offering fixed price/market price orders during the day based on the amount of inventory we have.
The bug here was that when the page loaded market price orders were available. You clicked the box to agree to market rate orders. But by the time "Buy Bitcoins" was clicked, fixed price orders had become available again in the background - and that is what got incorrectly saved on your order.
Anyway, we just pushed out a fix for this so it isn't possible to happen again, and we are crediting people back the difference.
In short, "never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by software bugs". Sorry for the trouble! When we mess up, we make it right.
@_date: 2013-06-24 19:25:00
Brian from Coinbase here - this comment is accurate.  Like many in the bitcoin eco-system we experienced some "growing pains" during the last bubble.  But I think we're in a better place now because of it in terms of reliability and level of support.
It's also true that we have been hiring slowly - we're very concerned about keeping a high bar and we've seen way more startups fail from hiring too fast than too slow.  We've had the largest fundraise so far in bitcoin so it is not for lack of funds, we just want to make a great place to work that will stand the test of time.
There is plenty we're working on, but I think you'll find us open to feedback and quick to implement new features for our customers.
Happy to chat further if you have any questions (I'll PM you my personal email).
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:34:49
We're down - great idea.
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:22:36
Hopefully this provides conclusive proof that we don't just cancel transactions when the price goes up!
Seriously though, happy to review your account for future purchases.
We now have about 100,000 users and there are just three of us full time still.  So these automated risk detection techniques aren't always the smartest.  We manually review when there is an issue though.
@_date: 2013-10-07 01:02:48
Brian from Coinbase here.  Sorry to hear that, we've seen some cases where unconfirmed coins get in a wallet and caused issues like this (so the tx never reached the blockchain).  Would love to take a look at your account to get some more details - you may have already, but if not please message us (support at our domain dot com).  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-01-29 20:44:35
I can understand your frustration on this - it sucks to think a purchase has gone through, and then it turns out it didn't.
I wanted to clarify our (Coinbase's) position on it.
If you are sending/receiving bitcoin-to-bitcoin there is no such thing as a reversal.  There is also no such thing as a frozen account on Coinbase.  The only issue comes up when users want to buy bitcoin for a reversible payment mechanism (like a bank transfer).  In other words, interacting with legacy payment systems.  In these situations if we feel we will not be able to collect payment for the bitcoin we deliver, then we are not going to sell the bitcoin.
There are a lot of bad folks out there dedicating every day of their life trying to scam people/companies out of bitcoins (including us).  But 99% of people are good, and want an easier way to buy/sell bitcoin (meaning via reversible payment mechanisms which tend to be the most consumer friendly).  So what are we to do?
The solution ends up being that we do our best to sell bitcoin via these reversible payment methods, but we approach it cautiously to weed out the bad folks, and once in a while we wind up blocking someone good like yourself in the process.  For that I am truly sorry.  I wish there was a better way.  But if it's a choice between staying in business at all, and making a few mistakes, then we have to wade through the mistakes while continually trying to get better at it.
In some ways this post shows the real potential/power of bitcoin - with an ideal currency these issues would be much less common.  But as it stands today people still need an easy way to convert traditional currencies into and out of bitcoin, so hopefully we can provide value operating in the difficult world of these traditional payment methods and easing the transition for people.
We're working hard to get better.  Thank you for bearing with us.
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:56:54
This was us and not a phishing attempt.  Sorry about that - we were going back through our records to update something for our taxes and these accidentally got triggered.  It should be fixed now, but sorry for confusion on that.
@_date: 2013-05-28 21:46:57
You shouldn't face this problem the way we've built it on Coinbase. We have it set to restore the *full amount* when you import a paper wallet back to your account.  So there is no chance of losing the change.
@_date: 2013-06-28 05:11:23
For an easy way to follow the strategy in the infographic, check out Coinbase recurring buys - you can set it to automatically buy $50 USD worth of bitcoin each week, automatically debited to your bank account.
@_date: 2013-10-21 21:36:54
It is a great idea and service.  We just didn't think it was easy enough to understand for people new to bitcoin, and wanted to make it easier to claim your first bitcoin.  Try both and see if you think it is an improvement, we're always open to feedback.
Also off-blockchain micro-transactions are free on Coinbase so it saves on fees which is pretty ideal for a tipping service where most amounts are small.  You could even auto tip 1 satoshi per upvote if you wanted.

Hello and thanks for the heads up on this.  We are almost done going through and cleaning these up.  Please check your balance and see if it now back to normal.
This was a view bug (the coins were never moved) that resulted from the unconfirmed transactions earlier this week.  Basically a bunch of pending transactions got added which were not processed yet but they were still affecting the balance calculation.
Did a major rewrite of it saturday and pushed it out, so this *should* be a thing of the past.  Definitely made us look bad though as the balance is one thing that should never get messed up.
We are still going through support requests but if you see anything else definitely let us know.  Thank you for bearing with us!

Yep, it was around 5am here in SF when this bug kicked in unfortunately so nobody was awake, except one person on Europe who could not resolve it on their own.

The USD price will never change.  We will just convert that amount of USD to bitcoin at the current market price.
And of course, you can cancel any time before the btc arrive.
As mentioned above, this is only once we run out of inventory for the day - purchases will be quoted as normal up to that point, this is just a fall back for people who are eager to get BTC and a price flexible.

This particular issue wasn't related to the number of users on the service, so limiting new accounts I don't think is the right approach.  Also it would be a shame to limit the service to new users, due to some rare issues.
The iOS keeping you logged in is by design.  There is a pin code you can set using the app (or use the screen lock built into iOS) to alleviate this issue you mentioned.
Just sent you a bitcoin tip though!

Brian from Coinbase here.  Sorry about that - we're getting about 500 support tickets a day and working hard to hire more people to help with that.
Sometimes we send credits to bank accounts and the bank rejects them.  In this case the "not a deposit account" message means that for some reason the bank didn't accept our credit.  We've seen this happen sometimes with non-standard bank accounts (prepaid cards with account/routing numbers, savings accounts that are over the limit for number of transactions that month, etc) or it could just be a typo (different banks use the code in different ways).
In any event, that doesn't excuse the 9 BTC not coming back to you, which should have happened automatically.  That was our fault.  If you can PM me the email on your account would love to take a look so we can fix that going forward.
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:10:01
Thank you for alerting people.  First report we've seen on it - can you send us a note to support at coinbase.com?  We'd like to check out a copy of the original email.
Phishing attempts are unfortunately going to become increasingly common I think.
Edit: Nice, Gmail is showing a warning over the email given the spoofed email address they used.    Many will probably end up in spam folders.

Hi there, nope you haven't been scammed.  It looks like your bank rejected the payout and sent us that return code (sometimes this happens when there is typo on the account number or routing number, although there could be other reasons as well).  We'll credit the bitcoin back to your account and you can delete/re-add the bank account again.  Sorry for the confusion on that!
@_date: 2013-01-24 20:00:28
Brian from Coinbase here.  Our strategy around employee fraud is:
* keep 90% of funds offline
* use multi-sig (2 or 3, 3 of 5, etc) to encrypt those offline keys in multiple locations
* all employees must pass a criminal background check
The key piece here is the multi-signature encryption because it ensures that no one person can abscond with funds alone.  There would have to be collusion.  And if you are going to find a partner in crime/try to get someone to go in with you, you are risking them ratting you out.  Banks use similar practices.
Regarding the number of transactions changing, this won't affect our business model too much (since our 1% happens on the buy/sell piece) but transaction fees will probably go up.  A lot of the work around adjusting protocol rules is done by excellent other folks, so in those situations we are largely just following their guidance.  Thanks!

Sorry about that - we might not have read the support request as closely as we should have (I can try to look it up if you'd like).
We do get this error message back from the bank periodically (current working theory is that it is when there is a typo in the account number that was entered.  We pushed a fix for this last Thursday which also verifies the entered account number more closely.  This should prevent it going forward (assuming the cause I mentioned is correct).
Re-adding the bank account should solve it.  Thanks for bearing with us on that and sorry again for the trouble!

Additional reporting requirements kick in when people wish to do buys/sells greater than $10,000.  Our limits are currently below this on Coinbase, but we still collect personally identifiable information (bank account, which validates your name etc, phone) and we have an AML program that has been audited by our bank partner a few times.  We will likely add additional tiers later this year that allow people to buy &gt; $10,000 worth of bitcoin, and this will come with collecting additional information that you might be familiar with.  Hope it helps.

Coinbase CEO here.
What we're looking at is a list of merchant checkout pages. It is the information merchants fill out on this page:
Or 
**Your information is not going to be shown on one of these pages unless you created a "buy now"/donate button or checkout page and posted a public link to it somewhere.** Order pages are designed to be public so customers can reach them, although we should have taken more care to not make them easily indexible by Google.
The email in particular, although we encoded using hex encoding to make it more difficult to scrape, should not be shown on that page. We will take a look today at some ways to get it removed from the Google cache, and avoid having these pages indexed.  Will post an official response on our blog shortly.  Sorry for the scare!

Brian from Coinbase here.  Great idea - let us see what we can do here.  I think it makes a lot of sense that long term storage of bitcoin should be treated differently from day to day spending funds.
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:57:37
Good points - as long as you accumulate at least 0.01 BTC in tips you can then send it out of Coinbase to an external wallet (we even pay the miner fee for you when you do this).  So we don't want to have lock in there.
I agree with you there is a downside to only having it work on one wallet during the signup process.  The benefits are what you correctly pointed out: you can do arbitrarily small amounts with no fees (great for a tip bot) and hopefully it is an easier onboarding process for people new to bitcoin.  The benefit to us is we get a new user, but they certainly don't need to keep the funds there if they don't want.
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:58:15
**Brian from Coinbase here.**
We'll have our Chief Compliance Officer reach out to them and see if we can get more info, or answer any questions they might have.  Usually these things can be cleared up with a phone call - hopefully just a misunderstanding.

Hi All,
Brian from Coinbase here - we spent some time investigating this issue after we noticed similar delays on blockchain.info.  Our txs were not appearing until they made it into a block, despite being relayed to all other bitcoin nodes.
To be clear, most transactions broadcast within a few seconds on Coinbase.  There is no technical or business reason why we would want to delay broadcasting transactions.
As far as we can tell, this is an decision blockchain.info made to not accept txs with unconfirmed inputs (unless they are submitted manually through their /pushtx interface).  Coinbase sends a high volume of transactions, so we often have many transactions in a 10 minute period that use each other as inputs.  This is standard in the bitcoin protocol, and from what we can see 99% of other nodes accept our transactions, and they always get mined quickly.  I'm assuming there was a good reason blockchain.info made this change away from the default (they may have been getting spammed with double spends, or I'm not sure what).  We are still trying to gather more info here.
BitPay saw a similar issue and I'm not sure why, but we've reached out to them.
In the mean time, we've started pushing all txs to blockchain.info's /pushtx interface.  As we keep scaling, we will most likely keep bumping up against scaling challenges.  Thanks for bearing with us as we work on keeping the everything running smoothly.
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:07:07
This doesn't lock them into using Coinbase.  They can move the bitcoin to any wallet they'd like.
@_date: 2013-08-07 02:10:52
It happens using the regular send_money api call:
It just adjusts what happens underneath based on the amount and if you are sending to another Coinbase account.

Hello, so sorry for the trouble on this!  We have been working long days the past few days to re-architect our backend to keep up with growth.  The demand for bitcoin recently has been completely crazy and the site has gotten flooded with traffic.  We performed a rather large migration of data, and redid how the backend works completely.  It looks like we're almost out of the woods, but we want to be careful with how fast we change things, and run full test suites before upgrading.
We realize it is totally frustrating, and not ok, that there has been downtime and the transactions have been pending.  We got completely caught off guard by the amount of growth, and it's been pretty embarrassing to have so much down time.  Thank you for bearing with us as we try to keep up with the growth of bitcoin!
This is probably as good a time as any to mention that if you are in SF and are an awesome software engineer, we're hiring:

Did your bitcoin go up more than 1% since you bought it?
@_date: 2013-04-28 03:07:29
Can you send us a note (support at coinbase dot com) with the transaction?
Most transactions go out to the bitcoin network in a few seconds, so we'd like to take a closer look at how that might have happened.
Also, I'm confused because our iPhone app doesn't allow sending of bitcoin right now (Apple wouldn't allow us in the store with that feature).  Maybe you were using the mobile website?  Shouldn't matter but was just surprised you said it sent from the iphone app since that shouldn't be possible.
Edit: Just wanted to add that this feedback is important and it's something we pushed out some fixes on today.  Transactions can be delayed for a variety of reasons, regardless of which wallet you are using, including:
1. blockchain being out of sync
2. not including sufficient fees
3. double spends
4. a few others
Coinbase pays the miner fee on your behalf for example, and you don't need to sync the blockchain, so we are trying to make this process easier for users to get fast transactions out, but I'm not going to claim we've had it perfect.  There have definitely been situations where transactions have delayed going out as we're processing high volumes (about a 100k transactions per month right now and growing) so there are instances where they've failed for a few hours.  If you see this happen please send us a note with a link to the transaction - when we see it happen we can help correct it and makes sending more reliable.

Hi Everyone, just wanted to post more details on what happened.  This was a bug on our part.
We switch between offering fixed price/market price orders during the day based on the amount of inventory we have.
The bug here was that when the page loaded market price orders were available.  You clicked the box to agree to market rate orders.  But by the time "Buy Bitcoins" was clicked, fixed price orders had become available again in the background - and that is what got incorrectly saved on your order.
Anyway, we just pushed out a fix for this so it isn't possible to happen again, and we are crediting people back the difference.
In short, "never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by software bugs".  Sorry for the trouble!  When we mess up, we make it right.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:29:56
**Brian from Coinbase here.  This is now fixed!**
Really appreciate the suggestion.  Keep em coming.
@_date: 2013-01-26 20:44:56
Yep - apologies for the delay on that.  Luke-Jr's comment is spot on.  Our fee was insufficient on that size tx, and it caused an unconfirmed chain.  We are working on correcting this now - thanks for bearing with us and hopefully we should have a permanent fix out later today.
@_date: 2013-02-28 20:59:40
I came to post the blog link as well - but we fully agree, it is a bad experience right now and are working hard on a resolution.

You are correct.
We just updated with a blog post: 
These are merchant checkout pages.  Your information is not going to be shown on one of these pages unless you created a "buy now" button, donate button, or checkout page and posted a public link to it somewhere as a merchant. Order pages are designed to be public so customers can reach them, but we messed up by making them publicly indexable and including merchant contact info there without being more explicit.  The email in particular should not have been included.  More details in the blog post.  Very sorry for the trouble on this!
@_date: 2013-02-17 04:51:27
We are working through support requests, and just put up a blog post: 
Rest assured we will respond to you there.  Very sorry for for the delays.

The chrome extension runs locally in your browser (nothing server side) and keeps the OAuth2 authentication to your Coinbase account.
BitTip has a small server side component also which keeps a mapping from a reddit username to a bitcoin address.  These two pieces working together make it all happen.  So there is some link there.
Hopefully this helps clarify.  The code for the extension and server side component are open source as well.

We sent a DM with info.  Will see how it goes!
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:47:56
Good feedback!  This was an accidental side effect of some backend code that we had to upgrade.  Unfortunately the user interface on the front end didn't get as much love as it should have.
I believe if you click the "Buy Details" or "Sell Details" link on the transaction, it will take you to a page with more details.  But you're right that the one line summary before was better - let us take a crack at fixing that this week and see if we can roll it out.  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-02-08 00:33:05
A lot of the user agreement is boilerplate we had to throw together quickly (we'd ideally like to go back and write one from scratch which better highlights what we're all about, and avoids any unclear wording).
The main change in the new version were these two sections:
4.1 Coinbase may cancel or reverse potentially high-risk purchases made using reversible payment methods.
4.2 When buying or selling bitcoin, you are buying or selling from Coinbase directly.  Coinbase does not act as an intermediary or marketplace between other buyers and sellers of bitcoin.
We wanted to make it clear that the only cancellations/reversals happening were people buying/selling bitcoin through reversible payment methods (we don't ever cancel or reverse bitcoin transactions).  We feel like this distinction is important. And secondly, that you are buying/selling from Coinbase (our own inventory of Bitcoin, not from others).
Btw, (constructive) bad mouthing is always on the table :)  We are still a long way from having everything working the way we'd like.  So keep the feedback coming.
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:17:14
Sorry about that!  You should register for an account and click the link.  If it says it's already been used, do you see the transaction in your account?  It may already be in there.  Thanks!

We had the send/receive functionality built (you can see it in one of the screenshots) but removed it at the request of Apple to get in the store.  They are still evaluating bitcoin (taking a conservative approach) but I think as they start to see more legitimate uses of bitcoin they could be convinced (time will tell).
