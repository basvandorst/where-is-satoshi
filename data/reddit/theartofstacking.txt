PastaArt, laws are not relevant when you either A) Write them, B) Pay to have them written for you, or C) Are above them.  The rut beckons.

You must not understand A) How banks work, or B) what bitcoins are actually designed for.  You need to either watch the video, or check out the comments from the guy who founded VISA on "governance" and "debt."

"Fear mongering?"  Get real.  Bitcoiner was duped from day one.  The bankers love bitcoins.  The founder of VISA, Blythe Masters of JP Morgan, The former CEO of Citibank, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Lawrence Summers - former TREASURY SECRETARY - all LOVE bitcoins.  Worse yet for bitcoiner is this: The video shows that at XAPO they are saying that bitcoins are about GOVERNANCE and that money is DEBT and bitcoins are GREAT to help TRACK THAT.
And, nowhere in the video did he deter anyone from btc.  He actually said the OPPOSITE.  He said that whether you like it or not, you BETTER learn and get ready for them because they are the future. 
One problem with bitcoiner is the seeming inability to listen to what's being said, not what they want to hear.

PastaArt, it's worse than that.  The banks can have 1000 server farms in 1000 warehouses and mine bitcoins in ways that were supposed to be the domain of the "little guy."  And, they get all that power from the money they took from everyone over the last 100 years.  They can buy them all by sitting on the bid on every exchange.  They have unlimited cash to do this.  They can not only "corner the market," but they can BE the market.  Bitcoiner opened the gates, and the trojan horse is about to open.
