Other ones like the ones that you can use your gpu with 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:29:01
I mean if it was a lot he wouldn't be selling it, this is more for those who want to buy a finished product in hopes of then making it better 
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:29:24
Bch also is going down it was at 700 now fell way down 
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:27:36
It really sounds too good to be true, it says 0 dollars a month fee and 0 conversion fee, that doesn't seem to make sense
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:41:01
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:51:22
If you would have hopped on the bitcoin cash train you would have made around 200 per each bitcoin overnight :/
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:18:33
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:52:57
Yeah even though coinbase has higher fees the fact is, it's easy to buy and sell and you can just do it whenever you want to just by opening up an app and clicking buy, it's really paying for itself if you're just starting out 
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:23:10
As long as you still get any sort of confirmation you're receiving the money then it's fine 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:15:37
What app is this if I may ask?
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:41:47
Is this a scam? How come no one I know talks about this 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:10:54
What if it dips from 15,000 to 11,000 you'd have them bought in at 11000 instead of 10000 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:05:39
I mean there's also zero guarantee you get it lol 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:27:18
Yes it is worth 9000 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:35
I have some money on bitcoin cash I never said I did or didn't 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:55:30
Dude it JUST dipped to like 8800 a couple of hours ago 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:45:40
Dude I don't even know what to say I can't sleep that's for sure 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:54:00
Not bitcoin cash...
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:35:36
No not really localbitcoins is your best option 
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:07:22
Crypto trading is a drug, once you get some you can't get enough man
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:23:06
I think it's a good thing to get people talking however I just don't like that many new people are going to try and jump in to get rich quick and when they realize their 50 dollar investment is only 60 bucks after a month then I don't know how their view of bitcoin will change 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:49:13
If it's just 200 dollars then go ahead and look at percentages, just become it went from 10k to 11k doesn't mean you're going to make that much on your return, so I say just go in when you want to as it won't make a difference in the long run 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:03:30
If there was a way we'd all be doing it
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:46:15
Tons of volume from new readers just HODL and relax right, remember it was only yesterday it was at 10k crypto doesn't always just go up 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:35:50
A month ago tho it was also at 700-800 dollars 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:13:52
Whatever happens just HODL and you're good 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:57:33
Damn so basically up to 32,000 in total income it's 0 tax that's actually pretty good for someone going to college 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:16:37
Damn 17 to pennies in minutes is pretty insane tbh 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:08:28
And then where's his guarantee ?
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:27:22
Yeah I see that,,, we could go down to 3000
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:26:40
Depends, for me coinbase took about a couple of days to even make the transaction on my bank account 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:29:48
Oh man thanksgiving chats worked out great 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:51:24
Yes it does take that long especially with the current network..
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:24:45
I don't think he can sell anyways as coinbase takes a few days 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:29:01
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:27:30
I mean the bch people also said the last pump was gonna be the death of bitcoin and they've stabilized and we've only gone higher 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:53:33
Bitcoin cash is bigger than both of those and it's gone up 30 percent in the past day...
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:32:07
Back when bitcoin was at lik  3k every time a dip would happen you would see so many of these posts claiming it was dead and was going to die, you don't see too many now a days 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:39:51
Yeah you're right I forget that we're in November haha but my point still stands that it has traded pretty high at some point 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:28:10
Yeah but I mean with the up and coming difficulty adjustments as bitcoins gains more and more traction do you think it'll be worth it ?
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:17:02
I see a big problem here where since bitcoin is still in it's pretty infancy state with huge drops and huge gains the average person that buys and then it dips will be scarred for life and think of bitcoin as a scam and tell other people as well, 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:44:30
It's an Australian site lol 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:46:29
That 8 dollars tho 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:37:36
Mind telling me what the fee was for it? I live around orlando and would love to to check one out
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:24:25
So what if I  corrects from 13000 to 11000 and you end buying at 11k?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:54:15
Depends on how long you kept it for, if you held it less than a year you can pay up to 40 percent in capital gain taxes if it's over it's like up to 15 percent and also depends on income 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:41:32
It's kind of crazy how much that coin has fluctuated 
Edit- in such a short span of time 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:11:51
This will happen, I see it all the time when people buy like 10-50 dollars worth and are expecting to become billionaires like the old days when they very well know even if bitcoin hits 100k they would have made like 90 dollars 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:27:47
To be fair haven't heard that one in a very long time on here
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:31:52
Download the app coinbase and let your dreams run wild 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:39:31
I know right lmao even buying 200k worth of power ball tickets you have a stupid incredibly low chance to win, 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:30:00
Damn 4 bucks is life changing money sell!
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:37:36
Because it's basically the equivalent of a modern day gold rush where if you got in early you made out like a bandit 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:44:48
We were here to witness history guys
@_date: 2019-04-02 11:49:57
Come on bro you think people learned their lessons?
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:13:33
But you're forgetting about that ONE random post that predicted it right!!! /s 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:08:11
Damn you aren’t wrong that’s actually true , remember the futures rn is at 8700 
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:47:50
Because it's trading at That price on gdax 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:19:58
I would just change it out for like eth or litecoin then just sell it on coinbase for usd 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:07:03
No don't think so 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:25:18
Yes, the United States west cost isn't even awake, and more places will announce their closing as well, I'm thinking 2700-2500
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:00:41
Bitcoin is like an alternative to gambling, gives the same feeling almost, not knowing what's gonna happen in the next FEW hours is pretty insane, but thank god it's going up 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:18:41
LOL give it a few minutes 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:07:03
No don't think so
