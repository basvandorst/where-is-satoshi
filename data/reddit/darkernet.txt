And a cheat it was, exploited by Chinese mining cabals/cartels. It was not only Chinese mining pools "cheating" but they were also the sole source of the mining chips themselves. That's a **massive** conflict of interest. They were not only manufacturing them, but using them to mine, then waiting *months* before trickling them into the public's hands. This was so they could make a boat load of money before the difficulty increase. The entire thing was a scam all ran by a few colluding Chinese businessmen in China.
When China entered the bitcoin scene some years back, everyone welcomed them with their arms wide open, as if this was a good thing. I was one of the few with the foresight and geopolitical knowledge to know this was not only *bad*, but that it couldn't end any way but how it has - scratch that, it could have ended a lot worse but I won't speculate on that right now. 
One thing doesn't understand, is that China's government isn't like any government in the west. They have absolute control over there. What they say goes, end of story. This is important because they have strict fiscal controls on their citizens and how they can spend/invest their money. They can't send money overseas, hide it, or invest in foreign companies without government approval, and they almost never give that approval unless you're connected or mega rich. 
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies allowed them to bypass the government regulations. Given that this is a country with a great firewall, and is incredibly touchy when it comes to money, it was only a matter of time before they cracked down hard on cryptocurrency. I'm actually astounded they allowed it to continue as long as it did. I can only speculate as to why they allowed it to continue for years unchecked, but I'd guess that they were attempting to figure a way to control it, or perhaps even take it over since the big mining cabals all resided in China, within the government's authority. After August 1st came and their hostile takeover failed, they neutered the exchanges and looks like they're going to be either banning or heavily regulating crypto. 
OP calls it a conspiracy (that the CCP is/was involved with bitcoin in some way) but is it really a conspiracy? China is one of the most controlling and authoritarian governments on the planet. Rather than be a conspiracy, I think it should just be assumed that is what happened. Unless they're completely incompetent, (they're not), I'd be amazed if they weren't involved. Bitcoin is literally, not figuratively, the antithesis of their own fiscal ideology.
 How anyone here could think China was going to be a friend to bitcoin would make me laugh if it weren't so sad. The government of China helping the TOR project, or preaching information freedom, and being against censorship would be more likely than them allowing and facilitating their own citizens bypassing their strict financial regulations and laws.

This same thought process applies, in large part, to the internet as a whole. My grandmother, for instance, took years before she finally believed the content she was viewing on youtube was free. She thought she was going to get a bill or charged for every video she watched on youtube. She couldn't grasp the concept of "free" content. She didn't know how it was possible for those videos to be available to watch for free.
This is completely opposite to how millennials think today. They believe everything is free and that they're "entitled" to free stuff. They have a hard time grasping the concept of subsidization -- where people create youtube videos, blog posts and applications under the premise that they're going to be compensated after the fact via ads and sponsors. So when people use ad blockers, they're depriving that content creator of their pageview. It's not a perfect system, but a perfect solution doesn't exist. Anyone who says otherwise is lying or ignorant because if a perfect solution existed, it would be used. Subscription and donation services have proven time and time again they simply don't work. Oh, there are the rare exceptions here and there, but they're just that; exceptions.
I think my grandmother is closer to being correct in her views; people should be compensated for the work they create. Nobody is entitled to *anything* for free. We take for granted we can visit sites like reddit without having to pay first. But I think there's going to come a time when the millenials entitlement is going to bite them in their ass -- it's just a matter of time until one or more of the ad blocking solutions get rolled out via ad networks which make ad blockers obsolete. We're talking things like serving ads up from the local website you're visiting instead of a third party call to the ad network (this is what ad blockers look for to block, they're on a global blacklist your blocker uses). If they're served up locally, your ad blocker won't know if abcdf.jpg is a funny cat picture or an ad for denture cream. Solutions like these are already in the works and employed by some smaller ad networks. Once a company like google rolls out their solution, it's game over for ad blockers.

Bitmain screams PRC front. If I was China, and I didn't like Bitcoin, how would I damage, corrupt or even destroy bitcoin? A (mostly) anonymous decentralized currency which runs antithesis of what we (china) stand for? People forget; China strictly controls and monitors everything its citizens do. They even limit how much cash, stocks or foreign currency their citizens can move around. They have a great firewall to keep people from learning or discussing certain things. This is a country who almost definitely sees bitcoin as a threat to their own fiscal plans.
So I ask, how would you (you = anyone reading this comment), if you were China, how would you damage bitcoin? You couldn't do it in the open; Opening the "Bitcoin Exchange of the People's Republic of China" would be a bit too obvious. Especially if you started taking actions which was bad for bitcoin -- everyone's defenses would immediately rise. No, if you were China, you'd pretend to support it, or at least be tolerant of it. You would then create one or more front companies so you can covertly poison the well. I think Bitmain is one such company. Who is bitmain ran by? Where did the CEO grow up and go to college?
I don't know why everyone is so optimistic about Bitcoin and China, that's the country I would **least** trust when it comes to decentralization, anonymity, and freedom. China is only interested in Bitcoin so far as it's trying to figure out how to control it, damage it, or destroy it all together. I can't see them supporting bitcoin for any other reason given how their stance on fiscal freedom for their citizens.

While I agree with you, I do think scaling is part of that "engineering" aspect you refer too. I think that it is important to its decentralization.

Is it false if they're literally arguing for it? Go look at Bitmain's tweets  and recent blog post -- they want asicboost, and by extension ... well,  does it need to be spelled out?

Careful, that's the mental gymnastic aspect I was referring to. The reasons why people assign value to something is irrelevant when looking at the bigger picture. Hell, it's irrelevant on the small scale as well, since it's subjective -- why you value bitcoin is almost certainly different than how &amp; why I value it. When looking at cold hard objective facts and numbers, the "why" something holds value doesn't come into play. It's a non-issue. All that matters is its function.

Or they could work for a competing company... I had a ex-roommate of mine always bad mouth his competition in reddit comments when the relevant brands were brought up. I noticed he never disclosed the fact that he worked for the competition though. I'm sure that's extremely common on reddit.

The whole point is that you're *not* going to prosper in the medium or long term without segwit. Unless you're a Chinese miner, that is. Then sure, you'll profit handsomely.

The "scam" of the federal reserve? Comments like these are why I won't associate myself with this subreddit, despite being a huge fan and holder of bitcoin. Reminds me of the tinfoil hat nuttery from libertarians.... This website was hell during the whole Ron Paul era (2007), with many calling for a return to the gold standard. Despite the practical and logical reasons why such a change could never work, it would put the U.S at a huge disadvantage relative to other countries. Our economy would drop like a stone from the sky, taking our annual GDP with it.
It's interesting to see how these people rally against fiat currency as it holds "no real value, only what we assign to it" while ignoring the fact that the statement applies double to bitcoin, their savior. They don't see the irony, or rather, they won't accept it. They think it's somehow different (it's fun to watch the mental gymnastics they have to use to fool themselves).
Simple fact of the matter is that if you think the federal reserve is bad, take an econ 101 course at any university. It's not so simple to just call it "a scam". In fact, it's incredibly complex so labeling it with that word usually means the person doesn't know what they're talking about. It's like if I called cryptocurrencies a pyramid scam. It would mean I have no idea what I'm talking about. You want to see a real scam? An honest to goodness clusterfuck of an economic system? Look at the Chinese Yuan and how they deal with their economy.  The U.S dollar and the federal reserve is literally benign by comparison.
