Is this a screenshot of a meme? Yikes.
@_date: 2019-07-21 18:00:52
Does bitcoin have access to cosmetic surgery?

What kind of illegal activity are they condoning?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:57:48
I put all my money into a stock from a company called ENRON?

So? He new what he was doing was breaking the law. Even if the law isn’t morally correct he still broke them. If you don’t like the laws then fight to get them changed. Or face the risk of punishment.

Someone on Amazon claims this device can only hold 5 coins... are they wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:48:42
Very good to know. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:39:33
I guess there are people complaining that it runs out of space quickly? I'm very new to hardware wallets, is space something you need to worry about when purchasing one? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:57:14
I'm pretty sure you missed his sarcasm. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:21:15
So if you lost this item it would be the same as losing a wallet full of cash? Or would you still be able to access your digital wallet online somehow?
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:32:41
Congrats! I like seeing people cashing in on a good investment. Lots of people are going to hate on the fact you cashed out and bought a car, but hey, you held on long enough to make some good profit, so enjoy the fruits of your HODLING!
@_date: 2018-09-11 04:17:27
Is it because it’s a stepping stone to popularize the use of crypto basses currency that could lead to full use of non fiat based crypto sooner? Speculating of course. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 18:15:46
Which also illustrates how much more potential it has. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:29:23
You either HODL or you go bankrupt. There is no in between. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:12:54
I bought at $3500 so I’m still waiting to join the down club. Hurry up and fall so I can buy more! 
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:25:17
That’s my point. Stop being soft. Otherwise you’ll spend your life being offended. Now get off my lawn. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:11:50
Woah slow down there grandson. Let’s not get offended by words. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:35:54
I have a super power. It’s the power to completely ignore bitcoin as I trickle more money into it each week. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 13:50:33
A few months ago I got the chance to spend a day with Maynard in his current residence of Jerome AZ. We ate food at his restaurant/wine shop, then shot some guns at the local range and capped it off by driving to his proper wine store where he gave me 6 bottles of his 6 favorite wines that his company produces. 
What I gathered from that day was that Maynard is a really down to earth guy, who probably has the highest IQ in the room.

Of course we prefer more than real estate. I can literally buy bitcoin from my phone while laying in bed. Real Estate is a pain.
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:13:21
I hate that mob.
@_date: 2019-11-19 16:23:29
I know exactly how much of a pain it is. Compared to Bitcoin it's a ton of effort. It's also not guaranteed profit. I've seen people lose a lot of money in the real estate game. It might be more predictable and stable than Bitcoin but saying that you essentially have zero risk is dangerous.
@_date: 2018-06-25 06:42:54
Someday you’ll look back on this comment and realize how small 16k sounds. 
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:24:54
It's about time. I'm ready to buy more.
@_date: 2018-06-10 08:23:57
There sure are a lot of places that accept worthless paper for the exchange of goods and services. 
@_date: 2019-10-24 01:41:35
Actually the trust that this piece of paper has value is what matters. 
Same goes for bitcoin. It means nothing unless people trust it can be exchanged for good and or services.
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:28:38
So the people who bought at $2 and sold at $19k are losers?
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:18:36
This post didn’t age well. And neither will my comment.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:22:38
Wow, there’s a lot to learn! I️ appreciate the I️ info though. Thanks. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 08:34:05
Is there a list of experts, entrepreneurs, and millionaires who have been proven wrong when it comes to crypto? 
@_date: 2019-02-02 10:08:00
They’ve been doing this to firearm related channels for over a year now. They are censoring all sorts of content. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:10:22
Totally valid points. I’m super new to Bitcoin. i don’t own much but of course I want to protect it. What is the safest most secure way to guard one’s coins? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:06:52
This is me. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:39:36
Is Coinbase considered an exchange? Seems like it would be. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:49:06
Congrats. I think you are making a smart move to pay off your debts and then begin buying into more bitcoin after that. This move ensures you benefit immensely from your investment no matter what. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:32:22
Someday you’ll look back on this comment and laugh at yourself.
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:29:34
Keep going! I want to buy some more at rock bottom sale prices. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:44:00
I'm positive that this is Andy Bernard's grandfather. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:48:48
I’ve been waiting patiently for it to go on sale! It’s about damn time. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 02:26:34
Me too. Every time it goes on sale I buy a little bit more. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:41:17
You’re either a HODLer or you’re a filthy coward. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:48:01
That's the thing about HODLing. Either you are or you're not. There's no such thing as one who HODLed. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:01:47
If it were backed by nothing then we'd call it fiat. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:20:17
I've loved it. I've been buying bitcoin at a huge discount. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 23:54:22
I remember when people said the same thing about Apple stock. Lol 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:00:51
"AMD increases production to make more money."
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:51:56
No, the secret isn’t to buy the hoodie and also put in more USD. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:34:48
This is fascinating to me. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:26:43
Okay. This clicked with me. I think I understand now. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:38:23
Can someone ELI5 this for me?
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:31:39
Can anyone explain what this "fork" term is that I keep seeing? ELI5 perhaps? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:38:04
What is the Market cap of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:23:24
Probably past behavior based on previous crashes. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:51:32
As an owner of bitcoin I know very little about world monetary situations. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:44:14
Nah, they just don’t about plebeians making fun of them. 
@_date: 2019-05-01 07:25:16
Well yeah. In other news Millennials are less likely to own a flip phone than their parents.
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:50:52
This comment was funny though. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 06:31:49
Pretty soon they will be worth the same. 
(Cries in shower)

Anyone who is moronic enough to put their entire savings into any one investment is too stupid to have any decent savings in the first place. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 06:26:53
What a bizarre and awkward song/video. It's not funny enough to feel like comedy. It just comes off as people trying really hard to be awesome... which in turn is then funny.  
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:22:54
How was he framed for money laundering
computer hacking and conspiracy to traffic narcotics? These were all proven in court. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 18:12:59
Trolling. 
And if you’re not trolling then perhaps backup your claim with any sort of logical explanation. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 06:25:58
I've never heard of the guy until today. And I'll forget all about him by morning.
