First I read your sentence I though he bought another  rabbit and then had sex with the female rabbit himself. Well, glad I misread that.

one coin is one coin, doesn't matter which one. what matters is: how much can I buy with it?

it's end of the month... well... it's the beginning of the month. people need 1-2days to get their salary and buy in again

in my country most banks are already charging for saving accounts. If you want to save long term for example for a house with 500€/month, you are having around 3k less after 10years than let it just laying around on your bank account. I am not talking about inflation, I am talking about flat numbers.

Afaik they see cryptocurrencies as investment currencies.
So, yes, you are right. As long as you purchase something, you pay the usual value tax. Selling for fiat before one year is problematic

Since I set goals for my "investment", I would have been left with around 1000 of those 1700btc, since I would take out everytime a part as soon as the price hits a milestone.
Just as much as I would like to sell as soon as the price would hit around 15k again (first goal to take out). doesn't matter when.

That's why you don't order fries. Also, don't order if you live 15min+ away, especially in winter

If it would go back to 100k again, I would like it. Sell at 60-90k areas (since that would be my profit) and buy back with half of that profit at 2.5k

I mean you can look it from investment perspective and from adoption perspective.
From adoption perspective you are totally correct

in germany you get a gigantic party-pizza for 30$ (~23€) with 4 toppings on that which will fill at least 4 people. *in the distance the fat controller laughs how wrong I am*

it would be enough to buy in when the price drops and looks like floor and sell just a few % higher. not regarding the price

as a hodler european i am offended

yeah, only thing missing is a nice flat/ house. and that's something I can't buy in the current market with my income. At least not in my country
@_date: 2018-04-09 03:56:43
there was a post about price correction in general and the average correction is around 70% (iirc 63% and 78% are common numbers).
if you look at rising from ~1k at the start of last year and a 70% correction the 5.8k or 6.5k are legit.

I still don't get it. Against who (ceo) and which of the both bitcoins is this post? And why?
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:32:14
are you sure? no other cryptocurrency has this? no. other? 100% sure?
