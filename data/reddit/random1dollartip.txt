A $1 tip for you! @_date: 2014-11-19 11:52:02
A $1 tip works just fine, have been tipping like crazy this last week and the response I get is mostly positive.
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:56:18
Thank you my good man (or woman). Your contribution went here:
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:13:39
I'm sorry but I wouldn't change a thing, that half of the 1000 people I sent $1 to actually collected it is good enough for me. If they didn't think it was serious, why collect it at all?
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:09:59
492 redditors have accepted the tip so far.

Such a sweet bot. :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:10:48
And wait a year and I might have given more than $1.00?
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:02:49
Very good, very good! You have helped brightened the day over at:
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:00:21
Ahh, but would you not then spit on your computer screen?
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:15:28
You're probably correct. ;)
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:11:59
Thank you very much! It's the act of giving that is important, not so much the amount.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:59:21
Wow, that is very nice of you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:25:33
Surprisingly few comments where made to that effect,.
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:34:18

I will!

Bitcoin holds so much promise and could be used for many good things, this is rare in the world we are living in. Thinking about this makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I actually recently quit my regular job to focus more on Bitcoin (and other) ventures, don't know yet where the Bitcoin wind will take me but I have hoisted my sails!
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:18:23
Yes, a while into this process came along with happy shouts and bitcoin optimism. Thank you ! 
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:49:17
Well, it was actually 17, but who's counting?
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:54:26
Well then, pardon my rudeness and thank you very much for this!

I really don't know, after leaving a tip I never go back to see what happend, just tipping the next person and the next...
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:37:17
This is awesome, thank you so very much! ChangeTip is pretty fantastic, thank you for making this possible!
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:01:04
Since this is a kind of random process things can get strange, I once tipped where people talked about someone that had died, perhaps not optimal...
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:15:35
Very generous of you dear person. Your tip went here:

I feel Bitcoin has given me a new hope for a better future and have been thinking for a long time how to give back at least some of what Bitcoin has given me, both monetary and spiritually. Thank you ChangeTip for making this possible!
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:47:58
Got a reply from in and it says "Thank you :)".
The power of Bitcoin is truly amazing.
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:01:22
Exactly! :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 12:48:01
Good work, always glad to see more trigger happy tippers out there.
@_date: 2015-01-13 11:11:10
Yes, if you create a post somewhere on Reddit and I randomly find it. :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:22:25
Wow, you are most kind, thank you!
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:19:56
I might have, since I work kind of randomly. :)

I have not followed up my tips or answered any questions or comments that has been made. I decided before I started to see what happens if I just randomly send money to complete strangers and leave it at that. If I had engaged in a discussion with all the people I tipped and tried to explain what it was and what Bitcoin is I'm sure 80% conversion could be reached.
Thanks for the tip!
