Is it possible yes. My guess of what day I will die would be more accurate than telling you when or if it will happen. Think about how many currencies there are that are smaller than the euro and still succeed. Bitcoin wouldn't need to be the main currency, just used by a decent percent of the population.

Could they not just immediately exchange the mined bitcoins for fiat basically like Bitpay does? You also have to wonder what kind of a markup they have on their products. The demand is pretty high while it seems the supply is low. (Last sentence is an assumption)

Only 10 times a day?!!! Teach me how!

Mine at 1127 got completely filled(luckily at 136). Remember to check everything even if you are in a hurry.

Just curious, how do you stop someone from stealing the cars?

I know it is my fault. I was in a hurry to buy. Exactly why I'm not complaining. Accidentally clicking buy/sell is something that can easily happen though. I don't see a negative in making this an option.

Wouldn't it be possible to buy bitcoins and wait for them to go up a bit in value and then sell? Basically earning back the money you lost on fees. I know it would be risky but you most likely wouldn't need to keep your money in for long. Depending on how soon you need the money you could just keep it in Mt. Gox and wait till the next price drop(assuming there will be one) and then buy.

I figured some people wouldn't want it. That's why I figured an option to turn it on/off would be better. I get exactly what your saying though.

With all the new mining machines coming out, you don't stand a chance. Sorry to be blunt about it. You could try to make a business or simply sell items you don't need for bitcoin though.

If anyone still doesn't understand anything, there is a "WTF?" button on the top right of the Bitcoinity website. It should explain everything. I'm glad to see it's back up and running again though. Bitcoinity is definitely my favorite chart so far.

There are a lot of dumb people in this world. Chop shop? Sorry if I sound like an ass, genuinely curious. Thanks for helping out the community.

Hm i noticed my order within 5 seconds and it still went through. Sit back and relax is great advice though, just hard to follow through on it even though you always should.
