The police said it's unrelated to the allegation that he's the creator of bitcoin.
They did not say that it's unrelated to bitcoin in general.
They probably just think that he's evading capital gains tax. 
i.e. it is related to bitcoins.

Worthless? This will incite lots of public interest in bitcoin, which will - at least temporarily - bring the price up.

Pfft. What a silly argument.
That's like saying:


There's no need for the *definition* of money to include a sovereign governance, just like there's no need for the definition of 'swan' to include whiteness.

Paypal are not the police.
This is like if IKEA's bank spied on IKEA customers to see if they happen to store drugs or explosives in their ottomans. That's just not cool.

I don't think you understand what Seafile do. They offer storage, not content. They don't sell photos of any kind.
(Of course when I say 'Seafile' I mean 'this particular seafile based hosting company')

That isn't profitable in reality.
Mostly because of fees.
Also, you need to look at market depth. $16 is really not much. But if you buy 10 bitcoins and sell them, you won't make $160. The reason being that as you buy more and more, the price at that reserve increases, because you exhaust the low hanging fruit. When you sell, you might sell the first bitcoin for $630, but maybe the next at $625, and the next at $623. That cuts into the profit. So it's not a scalable strategy.

Gumtree took down one of my ads because they claimed selling weapons is against their rules. It wasn't a weapon, but even more interestingly their rules don't mention weapons.
This sounds like a very similar case. Pretty poor attitude.
