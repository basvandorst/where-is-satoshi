Bitcoin party is over, alts are catching up as people get smarter. Can't rely on the name anymore.
Ethereum and lite are both nicer to transact in so all bitcoin has is a gold-like, difficult to move, store of value (not its original intention).
Raiblocks is the new bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:19:41
Lol no I'm a realist. I don't want to pay $20+ transaction fees on any size transaction - no normal person will ever adopt that.
Fast, feeless and energy efficient is what a CURRENCY needs to be. You guys can be the gold standard if you want but it won't be the currency of use
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:55:44
LOL bitcoin has NEVER been able to do more than 7 Tx per second.
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:55:01
Read Colin's answers and the whitepaper. Don't spread FUD
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:21:00
Xrb is even better
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:47:43
It could never handle more than 7 tx per second. Raiblocks does 7,000, regardless of traffic
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:53:32
Awful son, don't encourage your parents to gamble
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:42:40
You're an idiot. You just paid 42% in fees, probably 4% for buying it originally and then a spread on top of that. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:33:49
Idiot 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:23:36
Litecoin. People are realising bitcoin is effectively a dinosaur in the crypto space now
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:28:50
Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. Best advice is to not touch this shit, it's not going to end well.
The tech is here to stay but bitcoin is antiquated and the wider cryptomarket currently has no legitimacy

Dippy boi now that all the mums and dads lost 30% in one day. They're not gonna tell their equally financially illiterate friends to buy it. Supply of fools is over

Lollllll catch that falling knife!!
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:34:14
Bitcoin is $287 billion marketcap with very little utility.
Not sure how this says it's not a ponzi, probably more addresses the statement, bitcoin can't possibly go higher
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:00:40
Number of bagHODLers
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:29:32
Pays old investors with new investors' money. Requires more new investors to keep finding original investors.
Instead of paying through dividends, bitcoin is paying through capital gains.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:49:07
They're getting out because bitcoin has failed at what it was supposed to achieve. There are better altcoins out there now, if you're looking for big growth in bitcoin now, you're not gonna find it
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:14:41
You're mad you're losing money. It's cute!
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:36:47
HODL the bag for everyone else, late investors!

100%. People are greedy

If you bought in at 6k, relax you're playing with other people's money. Put it inside cold wallet and forget about it
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:04:36
Lol mate, I'm more in a Jamie Dimon camp than one of your immature crypto babies
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:08:45
That's what r/bitcoin practically is with its inferior tech to a large number of new cryptos. Congrats, you played yourself
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:25:18
Merry Xmas to everyone dumb enough to hodl. You're about to get a lump of coal
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:43:15
If you believe in bitcoin tech in comparison to other alts at this stage of the cycle, you're an idiot. It's a dinosaur and has first mover advantage. Betamax/MySpace of cryptos
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:50:23
You mean the same as life before life, I.e nothing?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:46:44
How can anyone think this is viable...
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:17:36
He's not wrong. The world needs a reset.
I think bitcoin will unfortunately push that world to a reset when it implodes due to people leveraging to get into the market. This will cause the next financial crisis which...
Will help bitcoin rise again?

Welcome to bitcoin.
Can't wait for this dinosaur coin to move aside for some actually useful cryptos. It was a trailblazer but it's had its day
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:30:21
Very likely at some point. It's also likely to go to 20k at some point
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:35:24
Look, another financially illiterate person

FOMO and greed

That still puts you behind

Welcome to a decentralised and unregulated market. Thought that's what you wanted? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:48:57
I get lost in where bitcoin was (2 weeks is long timeframe considering the price changes) but let's say it was 10k two weeks ago, it's now at 14k.
If she put in 5k, it would be 0.5btc and be worth 14k x 0.5.
Ask her how much btc she owns if you're really interested. If she throws a number like 10btc then she's lying
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:50:11
Yeh and you said you believe in Bitcoin. I'm telling you you're an idiot for believing in Bitcoin tech. $20 on a $5 transaction = not viable as a currency
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:20:14
Probs should've gone and got yourself education and a job rather than thinking making money is easy. Fiat may rot eventually but it won't be to bitcoin! See you at the bottom!
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:59:29
if you have to ask, put most of your savings because you're stupid enough 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:18:40
Seems like at best it's just creating a new elite class and at worst, potentially impoverishing those who bought into a ponzi and were the last ones out a burning building
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:19:27
Fantasy land. Nice in theory but if you think the powers at be will ever allow it you're out of your mind
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:33:31
This is a dumb comment considering the wealth concentration in bitcoin. One whale could dump all of their bitcoin at progressively lower sell rates and because of the lack of liquidity, other people trying to hit that sell button could be blocked.
Sounds like being trapped in a burning building
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:58:27
"Can you give people tenths of a bitcoin"
"Yeh I think you can"
I didn't take anything seriously after that
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:35:13
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:50:20
Just because something goes up doesnt mean it's a good investment. Bitcoin has failed and these HODLers are just recruiting new people to be a part of their Ponzi scheme 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:04:19
You're investing in a pyramid scheme. If you can't lose the money, get out. If you can, hold on for the ride and make sure you're not the last one off the bus!

Your friend is smart

Coinbase is charging $25 on $100 fees atm. The miners are the new banks
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:11:55
Good! You are using it as it's intended!
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:43:34
Ding ding ding!! Try and get rid of banks and new cunts will just rise again in a different form
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:25:14
Bitcoin is a shit coin tbf, just a first mover. There will be a crypto that will improve on transaction times and fees but it won't be bitcoin.
Also intermediaries are important - not sure why people want irreversible transactions unless they want to rip people off
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:39:13
30% up is less than 30% down
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:49:06
If you truly believe in the technology, you should be using it as a currency rather than hoarding it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:19:57
You get it. Crypto space is also a bubble though and will be the ripple catalyst for the next financial crisis. The crisis will help bitcoin long term.
Buy it when the world has collapsed around it
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:46:55
Because everyone says fuck the banks they charge spreads and fees, fuck them.
Then they plonk money in dodgy websites with higher spreads and fees and create banks in different clothes
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:29:04
In comparison to the other cryptos out there, it's a piece of shit. The only reason it's so big in market cap is it's essentially the US dollar to all other dollars/pesos/looneys.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:22:48
Dogedice was fun
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:15:23
90% of cryptos are faster. Look into Raiblocks
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:35:38
For someone who knows nothing about bitcoin, he probably shouldn't have put money into it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:20:58
Lollllll banks aren't so bad anymore I guess?!
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:59:28
Lol complain about banks and then the new institutions that take their place are just as corrupt. 
You guys are fucking dense.
Y'all want deregulation and decentralisation! Here it is! Stop complaining idiots
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:24:29
Enjoy the burning building you are trapped inside! Only way out is through the window
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:23:01
If you bet on futures then use your clout to manipulate the underlying market, yes it can have an effect
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:55:56
Yeh because $20 and eventually $40 fees for a small transaction that takes hours upon hours to clear are FUD. Ok buddy
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:30:56
Why? So the government can't get its hands on your money? So you can buy goods from someone, not receive them and have no one to complain to?
Decentralisation will not happen, you're talking wide scale revolution and anarchy.
Blockchain and DAG are technological innovations but the majority of cryptos will be worthless on a long enough timeline

I got into nano at $1 and within a few weeks it skyrocketed to $37. My dad wanted to get into crypto too after seeing that but I told him it was too much of a risk and was essentially gambling
