There are many ways to get bitcoin without all of the exchange madness. (See localbitcoins) They just aren't mainstream because companies that facilitate these services must be regulated under their countries' laws.
Correct me if I'm wrong about the LocalBitcoins thing... I've never actually used it, but I am under the impression that you just register and then the way you trade is up what you agree with the seller.

I have a concern with the concept of capital gains and donations. I was reading online earlier about the transferral of capital gains and I wonder how this affects people who receive donations online. Let me formulate an example.
I buy bitcoins back in summer 2013 for $90 a piece.
I donate 0.05BTC to support a website that I frequent. (Most likely using coinbase or bitpay). 
Based off the FIFO concept, my 0.05 BTC have a gain of $23 (using market price of $550) "attached" to them.
When I donate, because there is a gain and not a loss attached to them, whomever I donate my BTC to, have to cover this capital gain in their tax statement, based off their tax bracket and the fact that it is a "short-term" gain. 
How are they supposed to know that there is a gain attached to my donation? Are we going to begin seeing bitpay or coinbase asking us more information when we donate?
This is one of the weird things i have a major concern with in terms of the concept of bitcoin being both currency and property, but taxed as a property.

You do realize that this western union stuff is publicly advertised today. There are no advertisements for razr flip phones anymore (that I'm aware of).
You may be very correct, but the point is not really relevant here considering the problem is not the technology, its the fact that it is still pushed and widely accepted as a prime method of money transfer.

 Cool idea, extremely impractical. Our current time is based off of earth's rotation, which is seemingly constant. The timeframe for blocks is not as constant. 1 btc-minute now may be 1.25 btc-minutes in a week, and 0.95 btc-minutes the next..
Plus adoption to something like this is incredibly hard. Just look at adopting metric system in the US
