Taxes are to be expected. The translated text reads pretty positive to me. Seems like the interviewee see Bitcoin in a positive light, something to be embraced.

Or perhaps he's still teaching us a thing or two about hodling. Nobody hodls like the master himself.

If only we could trust the exchanges! Then we could place trailing stop loss orders and sleep easy.

Agreed, and what scares me is that perhaps a lot of the money coming in is from people who don't know this and are simply following the herd. People who will press eject in a flash.

Small stakes poker is a lot fun, so yes, I think he will have a great time tracking his thousand bucks in bitcoin as it dances up and down.
Perhaps as he becomes more comfortable he will dial up the risk and spend 10k.
1k is a nice way to get your toe wet.

Ayyy matees, ther' be storms ahe'd, but our vessel be as tried as a Yorkshire whore's tit, and as sure as the greed of the Ver trashers. The ship will hodl, she'll hodl.

Since historically bitcoin moves up more than down, yes, this is quite likely to happen. But if you plan on holding on to your bitcoin for a few years, this minor swing until you buy (I imagine it won't take longer than two weeks) won't make any difference.
And there is the off chance it dips, in which case you will feel fantastic having forcibly "timed" the dip.

1 BTC! That's all you need!
One Bitcoin to rule them all, One Bitcoin to find them,
One Bitcoin to bring them all and in the darkness bind them

Agreed. I was waiting for the right pump to get out. This one feels right. Seeing that Segwit alleviates the block size problem for the moment AND enables a series of improvements to Bitcoin, seems like a no-brainer. Bcash's solution to scalability is no solution at all (see  for more on this)

How do you time your buys? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:51:11
Yes, correct. That's my BELIEF, not information.

Haha, well, here's a toast to the btc cowboys! ��

I always buy at current price, as I'm a firm believer in the efficient market hypothesis. 
If you are buying Bitcoin because you believe it should be worth US$100k/coin, what difference does a few hundred make right now? That's IF you time the dip correctly, which in my opinion comes down at best to a coin flip. I don't think it is a coin flip as the coin is currently undervalued, so it should move up, not down.
