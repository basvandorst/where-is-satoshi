What think about Ripple, Monero and Cardano? Isn't Cardano a 3rd generation coin? I've heard people say that Cardano is a coin you wanna hold. But idk, these are the types of words they are using to try to trick you, and imply that the coins are better than BTC due to better technology. (by saying:BTC 1st generation, ETH 2nd generation, Cardano 3rd generation etc).
Also, what do you think about this?:
Bitcoin lost a HUGE chunk of market share this year to other currencies.  Started the year off around 88% market share and ends the year below 40% market share. A whopping 50% market cap share loss.
Isn't that a bit worrying? Obviously crypto in general has exploded the past year and that was bound to happen, but what happens if BTC's market share keeps declining and eventually taken over? Then BTC is donzo?

Should I go all in on BTC? But what about the high fees...? I've heard people say that even people who use BTC for actual purchases knows it doesn't have a future because of that. I've seen people on r/cryptocurrency say that BTC's only value is name recognition.
Keep in mind, I value the long term, I'm not someone who's gonna day trade etc

What do you mean? The bigger crowd the more demand the more the price go up..?

Is Bitcoin dying? So I read this thread a few weeks ago:  it seemed like the general consensus was that BTC has really high fees and that it doesn't have a future because of it. I've heard people say that even people who use Bitcoin to purchase actual things knows it doesn't have a future. I've seen people over at r/CryptoCurrency say the last couple of days that it's only value is name recognition. Thoughts?

How high do you think Bitcoin can go? Also, do you think most altcoins are a joke? What do you think about ETH? Also, would you spread your portfolio and invest in alt coins or just all-in on Bitcoin?

I hardly ever hear any criticism for BCH, but I hear a lot to BTC:
