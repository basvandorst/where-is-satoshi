Thanks. I can read the QR on my Android phone, but just not sure what I'm looking at when it's 'decoded'. e.g. Is it a fully signed tx? Or what does it actually contain?

I realised after trying some of these, that they have minimum deposits. It makes sense in the context of crap coins, that they would want minimum "0.35" or something, but since the only reason I have them in the first place is because of the forkening, I have... less than that, lol.

Wow that looks perfect, thanks. And LN makes the operation even cheaper.
@_date: 2019-12-30 08:15:54
Ah of course! That would absolutely work, if not directly doable in Electrum.

Can it buy a vowel? Like, a *u*?

...unless he's *not* talking about BIP39, but about seed phrases.

Most people in the world are smart enough not to buy a Lambo.*
*This hypothesis comes purely from the ratio of humans to Lambo sales.

Here's one example:
"What is seed phrase then?"
If memorized using a brain, some might even call it a brain wallet.

I think you misunderstand 'air-gapping'. I need to transfer the transaction from a computer that has no internet, and no write access to hard drives or external media, to a free-for-all internet-enabled malware playground for broadcast.

Can't wait for the next Electrum release with LN!

From holding Bitcoin when it forked in 2017 following a big bitcoin fight about scalability.
Maybe not-so-random, but still crap. And worth the effort of converting to BTC.

It was a fork coin that shall remain unnamed, that is now basically a scam endorsed by a guy called Roger. Anyway I dumped it successfully via FixedFloat.

Yes, that's basically what I Googled for, but didn't recognise any names. Thanks for the link!

That may be the point for YOU, but the point for ME is that it is programmed to not leave traces of anything on the hardware.

Try Tinder.


Is a compiled LN version available anywhere yet, or do you mean compiling yourself?
@_date: 2019-12-30 02:05:26
Yes, that's the argument.
0-conf is still good in cases where it was always good - very low value things that aren't going to change your life dramatically if a double-spend (or other fraud) occurs.
@_date: 2019-12-30 02:10:15


No, a "bitcoin" could theoretically be minted by performing only 1 hash. How many you have to try before you're successful is where the randomness (and difficulty) comes in.
@_date: 2019-12-30 02:14:54
As others have said, that site is a scam.
The scam is along the lines of "bait and switch" - what they're really trying to do is trick you into buying a non-bitcoin currency with a similar name.
@_date: 2019-12-31 03:52:56
Yes, every single known future event is priced in.
@_date: 2019-12-30 07:31:56
Yes, that's what I'd guess. Just trying to confirm all this guess-work somehow without actually spending anything.

Hopefully the attacker has now decrypted all her files.
@_date: 2019-12-30 02:36:10
Ah, hahaha I didn't know that.  So one of their main selling points is also in BTC anyway.
