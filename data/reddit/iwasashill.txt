lol I didn't learn about buttcoin until recently. Apparently it wasn't on the radar at my former employer.

If it makes it out of downvote hell.

I kind of am standing up regarding this. What sort of things do you want to know specifically? I'll try to provide as much as I can.
What can they do? I'm honestly not sure since they are using a very real human element. The only technical thing they can maybe do is search for the Chrome extension but I don't even know if that is possible, like for a site to detect it?

Just under minimum wage but no taxes so I took it.
This was about three months ago for me and I am out now but it is my understanding this has been going on at least with this group of people since 2012 for sure.

Sadly, not really. I can understand the hesitation to believe me for sure. I recently drove by the old office and no one is in it. Apparently they pack up pretty often.

Israel was on the radar for sure. I heard someone say something about China hacking as well at one point.

No idea what it cost but I know I personally made about minimum wage and I was desperate so I took it. It was cash so I didn't report it on my taxes.

Always cash and I was desperate so I took it :(
@_date: 2014-08-04 02:39:18
I likely should.
@_date: 2014-08-04 02:52:59
You caught me. Sigh.

No one has to believe me. I'm just here to say this is happening.
