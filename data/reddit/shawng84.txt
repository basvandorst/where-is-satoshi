But then why not accept it as a major currency by now?
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:25:57
Not really but everyday it's red....pretty ridiculous

Thanks a lot man, all because of you!

I doubt it was a government agency who really invented it.  Otherwise at this point, after 9 years I'm sure the u.s government would start to accept and adopt it in they're economy.  More importantly block chain is a very valuable technology.  If it was created by a government agency don't you think they would use it for a variety of different fields?

At least known reasons why something is going up or down

I hear what your saying, but a major currency that's accepted very limited amount of places.  Forget about what Satoshi wanted or envisioned, it will be a major currency once the u.s says they accept it as form of payment or will convert for you at the bank (in my opinion).  Getting back to the original point, if Satoshi died I still believe he would make arrangements for his bitcoin while he was alive.  Shit, if i invented bitcoin, worth one dollar or a million, i would make sure the ones I would keep would be securely taken care of and distributed.  It would be pretty damn smart for Satoshi to be the US government;  they would own the same percent of bitcoin as they do gold in our current economy.

He popping some bubbly that's for sure

If he has over a million coins and they were slated to be worth even one dollar, thats still $1,00,000.  That's surely enough money for someone to make arrangements for.

Why are prices dipping so low?  Everytime i check the crypto everything is down.  What is going on?
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:06:53
Well crypto homie, i check the price just as much as I check my stock prices, and I'm not a noobie to that!  So it's not a noobie thing, it's more of a, why the hell does it keep going lower and lower, lol

I never understand why he/she hasn't been discovered yet.  Its insane.  You'd think someone would do some serious digging and actually get to the bottom of who he really is.  They wanted to catch russ ulbricht and they made that happen, why not Satoshi?
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:05:56
Considering the route bitcoin is taking to actually become a legitimate contender in the market of currencies, i find it hard to believe they had the insight to know something like this would actually catch on.  For all we know the real Satoshi is just a smart computer programmer with libertarian values flying under the radar.  Similar to russ ulbricht, his friends probably think he's a bum lol.

I doubt hes dead, I'm sure he would be smart enough to advise someone or make arrangements for all the bitcoin he owned before he died.  The person is alive and well probably just enjoying the fruits of their labor.

Everyone syaing it's a along term hold, but why is everyone so sure?
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:27:29
Roger ver would not be happy about this lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:36:57

@_date: 2017-12-10 15:36:35
my parents don't understand a thing about this
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:05:34
OK im loving this LOL
