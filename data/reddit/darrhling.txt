Does anyone buy ETH on Coinbase and then send to Bitfinex/other non GDAX exchange and there trade to bitcoin? Occurred to me it might be a way to avoid the wallet-transfer fees. But maybe that makes no sense. :-/ 
On another note: hooray sale and hodl on. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:21:16
RaiBlocks, Realisto, Publica, Request Network, Iota, Elixir,  maybe COSS.
But then, I have a vested interest - I hodl (a small amount of) all of those.

Agreed. I love BTC as a store of value, but have literally never experienced a cheaper use or faster crypto than RaiBlocks. But I don’t mean to be a shill, it’s certainly not even the alt I’m most invested in. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:47:24
I just don’t know if it’s legitimate

I found the comment below on the 21 daily discussion thread. So if this person is right then if you’re with one of the below exchanges all is fine. But again, I’m a little unsure of this hard fork, feels like not enough people are talking about it.
“Thanks mate, I googled and found that the following exchanges will credit Bitcoin deposits with B2X:
Bitrefill (B2X will be forcibly sold for BTC)
Coinbase (within a few days of the fork)
Unocoin (within four weeks of the fork)

@_date: 2017-12-21 09:11:06
Is it true that Segwit2x is finally happening on the 28th of Dec? And if so, do people expect the price to jump up or down? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:23:29
Wow. I hope you’re right. Like I said, it showed a critical view. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s my view. But OP asked for info and it’s always good to see both sides of the coin (pun intended). 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:34:10
XRB for that. BTC can be like gold. Don’t see the issue. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:59:20
Solid advice
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:34:29
But if you think BTC has no value why would you buy it for 3050? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:07:30
Good luck man 
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:58:11
My deposit with them is stuck on pending... :-( Hope it works out for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:45:57
Any predictions for how low the dip will go? 
I’m one of those idiots who sold at 9k hoping it would dip and planned to buy back when it did so. Don’t get me wrong, I believe we’re going to 1m, I just thought I’d play at being a trader... 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:35:59
How low is the dip going? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:54:46
Savage :-) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:47:39
Here is a very critical view, but a cool video: 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:15:20
To 6k 
Edit: meant EUR
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:58:19
If there is, will that cause a new dip? By which I mean, is it more sensible to wait a little longer before buying more? (Given limited funds, else I would just buy regularly) 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:35:58
Hurrah!! Finally a dip! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:49:18
No, I buy dips. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:01:02
I love iota. I feel like the enthusiasm and the potential behind it is the same as BTC was in the beginning. Amazed your post didn’t get deleted though 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:36:51
Congratulations. I don’t know why people here seem often against trading. Although I must admit the actual quitting of job is a pretty brave step. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:47:24
I wouldn’t fully say it was the whole point. But wish you good luck for the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:09:30
He even made a video 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:11:15
Hilarious 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:08:13
Me too. Sold at 7,600 euros. Where is the diiiiip??? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:38:13
Well. Good luck... 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:07:17
Am a low-quantity hodler and dip-buyer. Would love to buy more. Am hoping for a bigger dip. Should I just buy now though? It looks like we’re set for 7-8k as the new peak. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:54:26
Why is there not World Peace? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:53:05
Iota 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:20:10
So. What about the new attack/fork (which wasn’t going to happen but now seems like it will)? Do you guys think it will lead to a new dip? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:46:02
It’s weird. When you’re holding BTC it feels unsafe not to have it in fiat as the value could plummet. When you’re holding fiat it feels incredibly stupid not to have it in BTC as the value could skyrocket. (And this is while believing it will reach 100k one day)... Once I am back in I am putting it on a Ledger and obeying these long time redditors - hodling and buying the dip ONLY. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:50:14
I never said the feeling was rational! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:41:05
Fear, uncertainty, doubt 
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:06:47
It’s the Coinbase, Bitfinex, Reddit trio for me. Gahhh 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:58:45
I hope so
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:30:24
Sell if you have the nerve. I did, and now regret it - can’t get off reddit and exchanges waiting for dip. Definitely not worth it!! 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:03:16
I agree. Think it will plunge down after it hits 9,000
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:13:58
Correction, yes. Crash, no.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:55:38
What about this idea that there may be a second attack and that the fork will happen anyway? Won’t that create a new dip? (Disc. I hodl - want to buy the dip, am still waiting, and use all these terms with caution since I’m by no means a pro.)
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:10:59
Yes, but isn’t it happening anyway? In a less dramatic way, but nonetheless? That’s what I understood from here at least.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:14:10
Brilliant 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:49:19
Well, good luck trading. I hope you make millions :-) 
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:42:11
Nice complex intellectual reasoning 
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:09:30
Also curious 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:17:02
Me too. I wonder what will happen as a result - a new ATH or a new dip. Can someone with more tech knowledge / TA ability weigh in? Thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:02:18
Does anyone have a gut feeling about the post fork scenario? I don’t care much either way about receiving B2X coins or not. What I’m wondering is if we’ll go for a new ATH or a new dip. Any thoughts welcome! 
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:21:16
That is such a risk though. I would invest small increments and wait. It’s not ideal, obviously, but still better than BTC suddenly dipping and you losing your investment 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:16:47
Definitely play it safe. I didn’t and am now desperately waiting for a dip.... 
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:41:08
Because I currently store on Coinbase vault 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:40:58
Nooooo. Fasterr!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:36:31
Maybe I’m paranoid, but I’m so not clicking that 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:10:22
Affecting 
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:30:30
Is this real? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:25:34
Amazing that this post the bots allow 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:44:58
Without those people BTC would still be under $1 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:17:50
I know you meant willingly, but Wollongong is so cool. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:29:09
Any other tips if you’re on coinbase but can’t get verified on gdax? Trading to ETH then back? I store on Coinbase vault but my Ledger is on the way...
