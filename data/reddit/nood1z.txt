Picking on the state of the Bolivar is a bit of a dick move,  I doubt bitcoin needs to be compared to the kid being beaten up by the local ganglord to show its merits. Unless your argument is that the US can't fuck with bitcoin using its full spectrum of means like it has the Bolivar...  except that would be untrue,  the US could fuck with bitcoin too if it had a mind to do so. 
Frankly it makes me sick seeing apparent anti-imperialists leaning on an imperialist framework of understanding to proclaim how anti imperialist they are.  Maybe the fault is mine in assuming that you are an anti imperialist in the first place.

Before socialism... christ, you Americans. Before we get to wondering whether or not socialism is the problem we should probably look at the economic aggression coming at Venezuela from the US, sanctions and such, and wonder if that might perhaps play a role in Venezuelas fucked-up hyper-inflated situation right now. When they went after Chile, Nixon said "make their economy scream" and it worked, Allende was called a Russian stooge destroying the economy and then the military coup went ahead and Pinochet installed himself in power. Right-wing authoritarian military dictatorship enabling Friedman and his Chicago Boys to finally do their thing to a real society of actual people.
Now we see the same again, the narrative of the US government (you know- the big pile of guns and conspiracies against the freedom of all those they do not control) and their description of what's going on in Venezuela goes unquestioned around here, it's all because "socialism" apparently, because corporate media and various right-wing 'think tanks' tells us so.
Long story short- Libertarians are bloody hypocrites, they're all onboard with Uncle Sam and his story's so long as poor brown people are getting fucked, and suddenly it's all "Gurbmint FUDing mah Liberdee" when it's done to them. /incoherant rant

@_date: 2019-03-15 14:06:37
This is a difference between commodity money like gold, and fiat money. The US goverenment is the dollar monopoly, it doesn't get it's income from taxes, taxes are what it uses to remove money from the economy in seek of price stability. Taxes must go up whenever they create trillions of dollars to build missiles or bail banks or whatever to control the quantity of money in the economy. Look into MMT (modern monetary theory) to get more of an idea what I mean.
What you say is true though if you're... The Dominican Republic or Italy or Greece or something. But make no mistake, fiat is a product of sovereignty, and the power of a government. That's why the US doesn't like anyone trying to move away from the dollar. It's also why the likes of the Koch brothers don't like the populace expecting government to use it's powers in their favor rather than in the favor of billionaires (create money for weaponeers and the nuclear lobby, create money to otherthrow a government that restricts capital in their nation (US based capital really), don't create money that makes the health insurance industry lose its captives because non-market healthcare provision, consider education a sort of luxury product rather than a national imperative of the future, you get the idea).
It's about power and priorities, it's not about shiny metal or government 'stealing' the very money that the government creates (or allows private banks to create) in the first place. 
I read that Alan Greenspan once said it's important that the general public never discover how dollars are created, because that would bring chaos. It is (or was) a secret for the likes of Greenspan not because fiat is a scam, but because his side don't want anyone to know just how powerful fiat is. Think what the people might demand once they knew that!

For someone who made so much sense at first,  you then went on to speak a surprising amount of nonsense. I think it was that weird gov-phobic bit near the end. Don't hang out with Libertarians too much,  they make people stupid.  Its very important to the would-be feudal lords that we all hate the public machine,  so that they can use it for their own purposes.  The Brothers Koch are a great example this, they're very concerned about their Liberty politics because they don't want anything to get in the way of the liberty of their Capital, which only something on the scale of government can even *begin* to do. The liberty of capital is directly antagonistic to the liberty of human beings, or to put another way, Bailing-out Banks over Healthcare and Infrastructure, United Fruit (now Delmonte) over Quality of Life in Guatamala... etc.

Shrink back government to get it off peoples backs, deregulate, privatize, markets markets markets and set Capital free. Making it easier to create and trade debt is a part of that I guess. But sure, I can see there being a  distinction between *liberhard* and *libersoft* so to speak.

Creating and destroying money all the time is exactly what a debt-based money system does. Debt paid back to the source is money that ceases to exist. Taxes not raised is money the state has created left out in the economy. Investments by the state is money created. You'll notice that the US is always happy to create money for the military, but not for the population. It's about priorities and power, money is a social relationship, it's not a form of subatomic particle or something.

I'm not sure why you've assumed the creation of money is to be done "on a whim". I'm not very confident that the FED is doing things right anyway, that doesn't mean the concept of fiat is evil and stupid and wrong. I see a lot of Americans slagging off the USA's role as the world dollar monopoly, but mostly it's seems to be just that they're brainwashed to hate something called 'socialism' all the time and hate that their government could do 'socialism' really well if they wanted to. However don't panic, the last thing the US is going to do is any 'socialism', they'll make dollars to pull work in to balance banks, fund military budgets, increase the surveillance state, and leave dollars in the pockets of the ultra-rich, all that they have all the dollars in the world for.
Healthcare? Education? Welfare? Infrastructure? Funding the care of their own former imperial storm-troopers that footwork in the USA's own endless imperial wars? The FUCK Outta hear, fucking Stalinistic money printing muddafuck!!!  &gt; :- (
blah blah mises, blah blah ron paul, etc.
Aside from all that, when money is created the value of it is not to be destroyed, therefore the limitation is inflation... in other words, keep the prices steady. In my opinion only the banks should have to pay taxes, the function of paying taxes in a world where the state creates the money it wants- is to remove excess units and thus maintain price stability (plus a couple percent inflation). Taxes are a quantity control mechanism,nothing else, this isn't about puritanical peasants storing grain for the winter, or some fat gold-fuck mercantilist king looking to wage wars on the international stage where gold is the only thing mercenaries will except. We have dollars to pay mercs with now.

Yeah couple of things, Extractivism is one thing that capitalism is particularly renowned for, that and Externalization. And we know about the changes Capitalism HQ needs to be making but isn't, and that we all need to make generally, this isn't particular to the Chinese state, which is anyway an extension of the Western consumer economy as it's pretty much where we have our stuff built at the cost-levels that make business plans work (well, not counting planetary). Although going forward I think it's expected that China will increasingly consume it's own output domestically, which will be a state-change to the global economy imo.
Another thing is that my remark was about state capitalism, which isn't necessarily authoritarian. Ones an economic system, the other an attitude of political power. China is indeed authoritarian but again, if anything authoritarianism like militarism- is a response to insecurity. But authoritarianism is also perfectly at home in the sort of system the United States prefers- neoliberalism. Neoliberalism thrives under authoritarianism and insecurity, it helps to have the cops break the heads of anyone getting in the way of market imperatives (build them pipe-lines baby, smash them unions, sure you can afford a holiday right now?)  indeed the United States is a deeply authoritarian society.
But all in all you're right, we're probably fucked.

Money is as real as the borders on a map, the ideas in a constitution, the laws on law-books and the mad scribblings in holy-books. When people say Fiat is only backed by men with guns, it should be noted that the same men with guns defend the notion of Property- which is why most people don't have to stand in front of their homes and defend their shit themselves against all-comers, because the same state (made of notional relationships and marks on papers) uses the taxes paid to it that are made of imaginary money to enforce your notional claim on 'your Property' (as defined in books of made up laws generated by fanciful made-up processes we loosely refer to with names like 'Democracy').

The US is pretty sanctions-happy, and once they sanction someone not only do they have no idea about the effect of the sanctions on the target nations policy, they have no politically realistic mechanism to cancel sanctions anyway except in conquest. And Russia is as unlikely to give up Crimea as the US is to return Texas, or ask the US to choose Russias presidents from now on or disarm itself and become a protectorate of NATO or whatever.
Rosneft and Russia generally are therefore forced to consider the US dollar as unstable ground going forward. I'm tempted to term this *prevenge* but it's really just being sensible, this is after all about billions of money whatever the denomination.
It's classic law-of-diminishing-returns, sanctioning people from the global currency makes it a less global currency each time. And if you need your currency to be global so you can afford all your stupid war-shit and finance-bollocks (strictly no socialism for the people just the billionaires) than you'll want to have thought of that before using the global currency as a means of besieging countries you don't like.

Well, that's what Leftism is, government run in the service of the "peons". I don't know what you've been sold with "Left" on the label, but you should probably ask for your money back. Though to be fair they probably spunked it all on nukes, bail-outs and jihadis, rather than the healthcare, welfare, education and infrastructure that peons tend to benefit by.
Interesting aside and sorry to Godwin, but even the Nazi's recognized that attaching "Socialist" to their name might make them more popular, it's one of those words like "Democracy" or "Love" or even "God". Everyone wants to claim the word for their team, with the exception of the US that has chosen the strategy of programming their people to froth at the mouth in indignant rage at the mention of "socialism" or the idea that their government should make itself useful to them in some day-to-day tryin-to-raise-kids-here jobs-can-go-away-sometimes and will-be-old-one-day sort of way. That's what happens when decades of billionaires have shaped your media and education. Even "Libertarian" used to be a Leftwing word until it was nicked by the Right, with their whole "rugged self reliance" delusion they're always on about, as if a human being would last point five of a unit out there in the wild. So who knows, there's a fair chance that Rightwingers of the future will nick the word "Socialist" (again), even though the essence of their belief is that human beings are *anti-Social* by nature, and require *anti-Social* political and economic systems to thrive (fuck you, I got mine, markets uber alles etc).
@_date: 2019-12-26 11:29:54
Leftism has nothing to do with it,  its pretty laughable that you think anything Leftwing is any where near power in the US (aka by me anyway as the Great Rightwing Regime of the West). But in any case  the US ruling elite dispises anything that thinks different to their Washington Concensus be it Leftwing or Rightwing or Martian.
Once more I can assure you,  the US elites are not interested in serving the interests of the masses and it genuinely puzzles me how on Earth you got the idea that they are.

Sounds a bit rightwing propagandary to me. For instance what happens when a government protects industries in its country, as the US, Britain, France, Germany, Japan etc all did while industrializing and continue to do- is that rent-seeking or economic development that goes on to generate the wealth, income and skills of generations down the road? 
Also, I thought rent seeking meant the costs laid on to a captured client-base, imagine a transport-system made of toll-roads for instance, that would be rent-seeking in the extreme, a toll-gate on every breath and movement because private accumulations of capital are able to use their monopoly-power to affect the politicos to make the necessary arrangements. Education, healthcare, security, water... ch'ching babe.
Some say that a free-market is a market without rent-seeking... I agree with that, so I guess I sort of agree with you but not sure about how you got there.

State-capitalism: The State is your boss. You work, you get paid.
From each according to Power. To each according to Influence.
Communism: No bosses. You live free in a manner we cannot imagine because we haven't yet been able to make a communist  society. Perhaps it is beyond us.
From each according to ability. To each according to need.

Forgot to answer this about me being Left and into bitcoin.  I have always found m9ney interesting,  not bling but the practice itself.  I recognized bitcoin for what it was the first time i heard of it. Money is a form of communication and a deflationary language as it were,  is important for savers.  I think Keynes was a great man (he was),  i'm into modern monetary theory but feel it requires a Marxist analysis,  i'm in that minority of people who know that there is no recorded evidence of barter ever being used 'before the invention of money'. In fact i think good money appraches the essence of barter and we still struggle to acheive that (the value of one thing to one person to be directly exchangable for the value of another thing to another person) because usually the medium of exchange lives a life of its own out there in the economy,  certainly gold,  but even dollars. So instead of a couple,  its always a threesome if you see what i mean. 
What i'm trying to say is that i find the convention of money in itself interesting,  fascinating really. And i think that fiat and bitcoin both have a role to play going forwards. 
Besides,  having a form of money that can accurately reflect ones relationship to the material base of existence isnt a problem the concept of socialism,  that being to engage with the needs of the society itself,  its infrastructure,  levels of education,  healthcare and poverty and social cohession and inclusion- social thinking neednt have a problem with a sound connetion with the value of actual energy and material and actually would benefit from it.  Use fiat to expand things,  use bitcoin to consolidate and save,  thats my general idea. And anyway for me being socialist,  or more accurately "socialish"  is merely about issues of good engineering.   The thing about capitalism is that it can generate a lot of poverty and is always boiling its way down to monopoly. Poverty is a dangerous biproduct,  monopolies choke off anything good capitalism can chuck up anyway,  and then theres Power,  something that libertarians are remarkably naive about but that will bubble up (or rain down)  in any system.  These are social forces that require good engineering.

Been there,  done that. I found Libertarianism both naive and sinister. It's for self entitled delusionals who imagine themselves supermen. When they speak about liberty,  they're not talking about the peasants. It's neo-feudalism.  By the way I fijd it hilarious that Libertarian hate-figure Keynes was a self made millionaire by playing the markets, then lost it all,  then made himself a millionaire again. Hayek died poor,  Ayn Rand relied on public healthcare. Figures.
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:12:20
I consider myself "socialish". I know that I and all I love stands upon the shoulders of giants, I wouldn't exist if not for the society around me, I wouldn't be where I was if I had not been given an education, healthcare, the means to get around easily on public roads even now I have a car. Unlike many Americans I even feel safe enough to not own a gun in my home or something because the society provides reasonably effective police force, laws and rights, and people aren't typically allowed to be starvation desperate enough to do whatever they need to do just to eat (I never lock my car door on trips for fear of car-jackings for example, in some countries this is unheard of!) Not to mention all that juicy technology state military research now beaten into 'plowshares' for me to do work and play games and communicate with people over.
All this costs resources, none of it was free. If the idea that we all pay into a fund that is spent on things that we all need- if this is called socialism? Then I am a socialist.
The process of defining what we all need worth spending the public fund on- that's called politics, in theory democracy would be a fine way to conduct that discussion but monopolies and power-elites complicate all that. Well nobody said running a decent society would be free and effortless. Well, except Libertarians and ancaps that is.
@_date: 2019-09-02 00:16:15
Actually I consider China state-capitalist. That's all these 'communist' states ever turn out to be. I suspect true communism on the society scale is beyond us as a species. At the end of the day it's all about power, who defines and controls your surplus, and who profits from it.

All governments are socialist to some extent. Most of the third world (the extraction zone anyway) is pretty libertarian, even effectively ancap in some cases. Unfortunately they are not allowed (by the international order) to do enough socialism to build up infrastructure, invest in the education and healthcare of their people, or protect their industries such that they can develop towards becoming the next Huawei or whatever). As a result, not many Libertarians seem that keen on moving to third world countries. Unless to buy girls, drugs and the blind-eye of the local constabulary. Libertarians want a society that's already been built up so that they can then feed on it and make out like it was their achievement all along, like cell-phone tech (some tosser in a black polo neck versus billions spent by r&amp;d services to the state-warmachine)
Anyway, well done Venezuela, using bitcoin for what it's for- independence and sovereignty from the powerful forces that reckon everything in the world belongs to them. Best of luck to the masses of that country, the ones who know what their government that they voted for does for them, and knows what it was like before the bastard in the north began making out like it gives two shits about a bunch of brown and black and indigenous poor peopl in what the US considers basically an uppity gas-station/fruit-plantation.

Actually the society I live in is also a predator of other societies, it has centuries of imperialism to its name and even now coverts the treasures of weaker societies.
That's the pattern isn't it, billionaires and first world nations make sure they have enough socialism to keep their affairs in order, and deny it to those less rich, powerful or connected. Even going so far that people like you despise the exact thing you should be fighting for as your right. 
Freedom for the rich, fuck all for the poor, that's what Libertarianism is about, the Liberty of Capital is not the same thing as freedom. 
Get your head straight, nobody is self-made, if you don't get what I mean I suspect it's because your scope is way too narrow, you probably only think in commodities and TED talks.
"Libertarian" by the way used to be a left wing term, until it was captured by the right and became what it is now. Liberty for the loaded, that's all.

They lose their minds, and push that Trump is a remote controlled Manchurian Candidate bullshit, it's laughable, and it's the mainstream position. Not to mention characters like that dodgy fuck Pompeo and creepy weirdo Bolton torpedoing any and all reasonable attempts at negotiation anyway.
Of course talking to these leaders in pursuit of peace is a good idea, but the US ruling elite seems to think the correct approach is sanctions, threats, regime change and war. Regardless of who the president is, they're basically the Klingons or something. "Talk makes us look Weak! You want to talk with Putin? This dishonors us!

That's not really a question of socialism but rather centralization. Capitalist centralization emerges as the 1% owning 60% of the wealth or something *and* an ever more authoritarian Center to make sure it stays that way.

For the USA anyway it doesn't even work like that. The Fed creates dollars, and creates as many as are desired to fund the relevant government program. There's no problem so long as they're creating the money for military budgets or distressed banks- no need to bother the democracy with stuff like that, throw another couple trillion on nukes, tanks, F35's and the like. Inflation isn't a problem because the rest of the world uses America-tokens as money too. Of course the tax system can also be used to remove the money and prevent inflation but the rich don't like it so that's not really allowed.
There's only a problem if it's about programs that serve the interests of the general populace (healthcare, welfare, infrastructure etc). By welfare of course I mean black people and communists obvs, not welfare that white people use too using the products of their own hard work to wealth-create and just wanting the government to stay the hell out of their personal god guts an grit type way.

It doesn't, it still bakes in a haves/have-not system of some sort.
Imagine a world where ones *word* was ones currency, somehow... in a manner that could build data-centres and hospitals and stuff. That- in my opinion, would be an economy of hero's and shero's for sure. Probably beyond us.

I disagree.  Money is a ration system. Get more ration units,  get more rations,  but some people really are just trying to eat. Thats not the same as greed,  although greed might be one strategy to make sure one keeps eating.  Altruism is another way,  most people get by on a hodge podge of both and more. 
By the way,  i dont see what right a system has to expect people to obey its laws while it stands on their throats. Gotta manage the bottom or the whole massive edifice will go under, and nobodys special because have money.

It's not just "cruel", its bad engineering. Any system produces dangerous byproducts, poverty is a dangerous byproduct but for some it's also a valuable resource. You can have large amounts of poverty generated in your system, and some people would get very rich under that regime, until one day there's an explosion or the poverty seeps out and contaminates your water-table to stunt your later generations. Bad engineering.

Even better. What's the big deal then, money belongs to the state anyway, it's not my mug on some note, the value is what belongs to the individual. Where does that leave "Free money"?

His first mistake was in assuming that every bitcoiner is also a libertarian fanatic who considers anyone else as a communist,  not to mention the assumption that all bitcoiners hate communism. How he honestly thinks that 'nocoiners' are all against private property is beyond me. 
Anyway Fully Automted Luxury Communism IS INEVITABLE.  Paece. Drops mic.

I don't agree, sure get a modern browser anyway but some website should not force you to change your settings like that. Shouldn't assume permission, should wait until granted it. 
for me anyway it's like going to someones house (not as a guest, as a visitor) and helping yourself to a beer from the fridge because well- the fridge wasn't locked, so....

So you think 'socialism' is a sizing issue,  or about local versus state government?

Venezuela is not a socialist country. The Bolivarians are leftwing but private property,  commerce,  all the usual features of capitalism remain. Venezuela is a capitalist country currently at odds with Capitalism HQ because of the non-capitalst value-sets persued by the current government. Capitalism doesnt build 1.5 million homes for the poorest people since 2011, thats not how it's supposed to work.

Some cant even do that,  the penny jar long since broken out to pay debt, or some food shopping.

It also really matters if the Venezuelan is poorer,  or the richer.  The poor know what Chavismo has done for them, the rich visit their friends in Florida and complain.
