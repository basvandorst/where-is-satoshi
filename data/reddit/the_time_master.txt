Have you paid attention to the value of bitcoin over the last 6 months?
I'm just glad I cashed of of the majority of bitcoin that I hold when I did.

So... patent and copyright law?"

People pay for porn?

5) easy ability to convert to and from fiat.

Gen X or Gen Y isn't good enough anymore? I'm sad.

Wrong - websites exist because of their content, not who advertises. The method used by the content provider to pay for the site is up to them.
/unless you are a person that actually enjoys commercials and go to ad heavy sites just to click on the fun flash animations that promise to explain one weird trick found by a mother in Ohio to reduce kitchen spending..
//just wait until you get your first malware infection from an ad that appears on a tech help site like Cryptolocker.

Older than you think.

Before there were ads everywhere, people took paypal microtransactions, donation drives, and sold merchandise.

Is this like a sting operation where people show up and get arrested? :)
@_date: 2014-08-20 00:46:09
For a moment I thought there was a prostitution subreddit. :p

People made more money selling equipment to miners during the gold rush than miners themselves did. Same applies here.

It won't work. Once you get that sweet sweet revenue stream you will never give it up. And at first you think it won't affect your content decisions, until a few months or years go by and you censor all of your content so that you don't offend advertisers (like fark.com or most TV shows on commercial channels).
@_date: 2014-08-20 00:49:37
Buy now before it reaches bottom... please? :D
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:12:48
TVTropes is great for wasting time. :D
@_date: 2014-09-29 23:56:03
I haven't see so much spin since meatspin dot com was trolling people.
I'm just glad I spent my bitcoins back when they were converting to $580.

Put it into an encrypted VM. No hacker is getting into that unless you let them in.
@_date: 2014-06-02 19:58:15
Depends on the value of the content provided, and if there is a community of users that wish to maintain it.
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:27:32
So, sell and get out while you still can?
@_date: 2014-07-11 21:44:19
A handjob doesn't work that way!
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:28:12
Blarg. I thought it was fresh news. Sorry! :/
@_date: 2014-08-15 05:19:17
I'm glad I bought those gift cards at $580 / bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-20 00:51:23
The gyft card model worked easy enough for me (to convert to fiat). Fuck trusting my bitcoin wallet to a third party.

Doing gods' work!

I get more value out of not watching ads, than the value content creators and distributors get by making unavoidable ads.
Do you stay glued to the TV watching commercials like an obedient consumer, or do you change the channel, grab a snack, use the bathroom during commercial breaks?
@_date: 2014-10-20 04:43:53
That's Gen X, son.

Maybe, but I have a funny feeling they are going to use her and then throw her away after they've gotten what they want out of her. I stayed with her for 5 years; let's see how long the new guys stick around.
@_date: 2015-04-26 17:38:44
Naw, I'm just hoping the best for her. It was like she could have been so much more, but through a series of bad decisions after we parted ways, life just got harder and harder for her.
@_date: 2015-04-26 17:01:23
glad I cashed out at ~600.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:16:31
Can I withdraw cash in exchange for bitcoins at the ATM? And if so, what exchange rate will you follow / how many days will it lag?
@_date: 2013-12-26 22:56:40
How do I get fiat cash out of that?
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:17:10
Thanks Coqui33, I'll keep that and you in mind!
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:05:36
I'll also check out localbitcoins.com. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:55:22
Yes, drive up value so I can cash out in the next week. :)

How to convert BTC into fiat money.

I'm good for a few more weeks, but I will check them out. Thanks!
