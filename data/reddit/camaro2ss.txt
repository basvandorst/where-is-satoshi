While most of what you're saying is accurate, it's not the cause of why he saw the ad he did. 
It's actually the result of dynamic keyword insertion in adwords, where Amazon's advertising team basically sets a list of words to target, and when you type that keyword into google, it will display its ad with the keyword inserted into the wildcard spot. 
Why did they pick "bitcoin" to target? Who knows. Could just be a low cost-per-click keyword that they determined their customers might be searching for and that it would help drive traffic to their site.

Ha. Close. I actually own a retail business with both a physical store and warehouse and 3 websites. 
As I said, if you're a small business and your profit margins are so low that swipe fees are a big enough expense to sink your business, then you need to re-evaluate your business plan. As far as "frequent chargeback fraud", I can count the number of fraudulent chargebacks we've received on one hand in the last 5 years. And we disputed and won all of them. Based on the other small business owners I know and have talked to both in our local market and nationally, "fraudulent chargebacks" are about as non-issue as they come.  
But hey, this is r/bitcoincirclejerk, so I fully expect downvotes since my real world experience doesn't jive with the anti-credit-card crowd that bitcoin seems to attract.
@_date: 2014-12-02 17:49:08
This is such a cringeworthy post, I don't even know where to start.


Because investing in bitcoin is nowhere near the same thing as putting money in savings. It's more like investing in the stock market in a volatile stock where it could go wildly up or down. More accurately, you're gambling. And gambling is much more fun than putting money in a savings account.

For the purposes of deducting your business-related expenses, you don't need to be incorporated or any sort of registered or "official" business. As long as you are reporting your income as you should, you can deduct your expenses directly related to selling the item. So if you're selling on eBay, you can deduct your eBay fees, as well as Paypal transaction fees.

We're talking about small businesses, and you just named the world's largest 2 retailers as your examples.
When you're got $127 billion (Walmart) or $74 billion (Amazon) in sales, you can operate on razor thin margins, because you're making up for it in volume. The same is not true for a small business. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:37:12

@_date: 2014-08-02 22:43:39
These "stories" come up every week, and they follow the exact same format, with the intention of showing how much better bitcoin is than traditional banks. The only problem is, the bank will reimburse any "hacked" funds, while you have no protection or chance of reversal if your BTC are stolen. And while hardcore bitcoiners are fine with this, John Q Public will be very reluctant to basically convert his money to online "cash" where if it is stolen, there is no way to get it back.
@_date: 2014-07-23 05:04:49
This article is ridiculous. Credit card fees are generally about 2%. That's 2 pennies on the dollar. If you run a business and you can't figure out how to build that 2% into your pricing structure, then you've got much bigger problems than swipe fees.

Regular ATMs are a very mature and saturated market, with lots of competition, so the fees are low. Also, most regular cash ATMs are owned by large financial institutions, which aren't relying on ATMs as a profit-generating machine, but more as a convenience for existing customers.
Bitcoin ATMs on the other hand are a very new and emerging market where there is so little competition, that owners can basically charge whatever the market can bear. They aren't back by billion-dollar corporations, so they need to charge higher fees to justify and recoup the owner's investment.
If bitcoin is still around in 20 years I'd expect the fees will drop to be much more in line with current cash ATM fees.

What an incredibly stupid and shortsighted business move. 
Here's a better idea: Open a store called "Bitcoin Cafe". Accept Bitcoin, but also accept all other forms of payment, so that you don't alienate the 99% of your potential customer base who don't use or have never even heard of Bitcoin. 
Here's the kicker.. on your menu board, list all your prices, and then in big bold letters put "25% discount on all orders paid with Bitcoin". 
That way, you're incentivizing people for using Bitcoin, or at the very least piquing their interest to learn more about it, all while not alienating a large customer base.

eBay has 0 incentive to accept bitcoin. Right now they control both the auction side and the payment side of the transaction, and can collect fees on both. The integration of both services gives them complete control over the buyer's experience. By accepting bitcoin, not only would they lose out on that control, but on the payment fees as well.

Let's look at this from a small business perspective (and not a 150 billion dollar a year company perspective).
Let's be optimistic and say the average small business gets $1 million in sales in a year, and lets be very generous and say 5% of those transactions are in bitcoin (1 out of every 20). That's $50,000 in sales in bitcoin, instead of credit cards.
The 2% in fees by credit card for those $50k in sales would have added up to about $1000. Instead, by accepting bitcoin, that business would be looking at about 1.1% in processing and cash out fees. That would be about $550 in fees.
So in the end, that company bringing in $1 MILLION dollars of sales would save about $450 a year by accepting bitcoin, which is about 0.045% (1/20 of a percent) of their gross sales. To me, and to most other small business owners, that's pretty insignificant.

It's almost like bitcoin ATM owners are in it to make money, unlike regular cash ATM's which never charge any type of transaction fee ever.

If you give the bank enough money, they don't charge you fees, because they're making it on the money you've deposited. OP however, is a "broke student", who doesn't have much money in his account, so the bank has to make their money off him somewhere else. Like it or not, banks are businesses. Do you think businesses are in business to not make a profit? If you want a non-profit bank, join a credit union.

Policing the use of keywords? More like trying to keep this sub on topic.
Maybe I should have bolded the second part of that bullet point for you to help you understand. 
* News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. **This subreddit is not about general financial news.**
The article you posted has nothing to do with bitcoin. Is it of interest to people who use bitcoin? Sure, but so are hundreds of other topics that all have their own subs. 
r/bitcoin would be a mess if everyone posted every article related to the current banking system that might be "of interest" to bitcoiners, hence why the rule was put into place.

* Bitcoin is one of the riskiest investments he can make. 
* Never invest 100% of your money in one investment. Read: DIVERSIFY

Who cares what it was 2 years ago? Most people weren't here 2 years ago. Your "perspective" is simply some cherry picked information to make you feel better about the recent crash.

Not true, according to valets and drivers in Vegas. For them, it's actually quite the opposite. They always tell me that the rich people are the worst tippers, it's the "middle class" that always tip the best.

Maybe they DO understand value, and simply feel that there is no value in Bitcoin in their lives.
Other than that, here are some big reasons why it's taking so long (and will likely never achieve widespread use) -
- It's complicated for the average person to understand 
- Non-tech people who can barely use a computer will never be interested in it
- Overall suspicion of it's viability 
- Wild fluctuations in value since creation
- Offers little to no perceived benefits to the average consumer 
- Limited merchant acceptance
Feel free to downvote if you disagree that these are not valid reasons - it will only show that most bitcoin enthusiasts have their heads so high in the clouds that they can't even recognize bitcoin's biggest barriers to entry, let alone try and do something to address them.

How'd you buy your bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-16 01:33:36
Sounds like you still don't get it. People don't have to have to understand the Fed or monetary policy to use cash. They just know that it WORKS. How things work in the background DO NOT MATTER to an end user, as long as it works. Until you fanboys realize this, Bitcoin will continue to go nowhere.

The law isn't specifically about receiving bitcoin. The law is about being able to trace the source of your money to put towards your mortgage.

Maybe they had it buried somewhere on their sites. I didn't see it in any headlines online, nor a single mention on any of the major TV networks. The only people who probably saw them were people on here who actively search out news on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-16 22:23:07


Why? Because they mentioned it by name? Cryptocurrency is not a term I would think most people are familiar with, so I'm willing to bet they added "(Bitcoin)" to help people understand what the word signifies, as people are probably much more familiar with the word Bitcoin.

You should care, because it's attitudes like yours that drive people away from Bitcoin in general. So when your bitcoin isn't work the hard drive space it's stored on in 5 years, remember you were part of the problem.

Uhh. No. Have you ever set up a merchant services account? You can withdraw as frequently as you like, and depending on your bank it can be in your account within 48 hours.

This is the exact type of stupid logic I would expect from someone in this sub. Congrats. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 16:43:34


You realize that what you're citing is literally the opposite of "facts" right? That's called "anecdotal evidence". And the idea that you are the sole decider to deem what is "legitimate" vs. "illegitimate" mail is just asinine. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 03:19:51


This shows you have literally no idea about the logistics of mail or package delivery. There are millions of addresses FedEx and UPS won't deliver to due to the cost. The only reason those addresses get mail delivery is because the usps is required to deliver to them.

Google literally does this for almost every "quick answer" query that you type in. All it does is scrape the answer from a website, and display it in a "Quick Answer" box, thereby depriving the website from getting a visit, and keeping you on Google.com.

Wrong. Instant confirmation, 24-48 hours to receive the money in their account, depending on their merchant processor. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 03:16:41
The fact that you're using your personal experience to extrapolate the usefulness of the entire postal service is what's wrong with that logic. The post office delivers 500 million packages and pieces of mail a day. Ecommerce sales is exploding in growth year over year, guess who is delivering hundreds of millions of those packages?

You are aware of the concept of being subscribed to a sub but not clicking on the posts to read them, right?
@_date: 2016-05-26 07:06:56
What does that even mean - "legitimate mail"? Do you mean non-advertising materials? And what "facts on the ground" are you referring to? What relevance does the percentage of advertising vs. non advertising even have? Your post is literally nothing but nonsense, which again, is typical for this sub.
