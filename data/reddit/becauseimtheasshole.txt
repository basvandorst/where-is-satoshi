The silk road would not have been successful with normal cash. This is because Bitcoin enables the properties of cash to be used digitally, allowing crime that would have to be conducted physically before to be done digitally on a global scale.
No coiners would argue that permissioned banking systems and the shift to a cashless society has been done for this very reason of preventing criminal transactions, and why Bitcoin will fail and be attacked by govs.

The difference is people trust a credit/debit enough to accept it immediately, without any kind of confirmation short of a basic authorization check.
No one will accept a 0-conf BTC transaction because of the risk of RBF and double spending, and often you don't have time to wait for a confirmation. Credit is much safer for a business to accept as a result.
Only thing that "fixes" this is lightning, and there are still major problems with channel creation, availability, balancing and routing that i don't see being solved any time soon.
Dare i say it, altcoins are a better option.
@_date: 2019-11-28 17:23:04

Doesn't wasabi have a .01 BTC minimum? $40 is simply too high a bar for mixing coins for the average joe. 
Especially when people like myself often make purchases and carry regular holdings less than that.
@_date: 2019-11-28 17:34:23
It isn't. I already stated it could be a solution, but in it's current state is buggy and unreliable with routing and channel availability.
And don't act like Bitcoin is gold bullion that requires all these dedicated resources and time to move around. It doesn't. The current hashpool of miners could mine more transactions, but refuse to under the delusion that a reasonable blocksize adjustment would completely centralize the network.
@_date: 2019-12-14 19:09:42
He was kind of right about Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin has hardly done a thing to change the landscape of global finance from 2008-2018 and shows no signs of doing anything anytime soon.

Yes. I'm sure on the handful of dollars several hundred Zimbabwean people have they will willingly agree to contribute that towards a single satellite dish to connect to a blockchain they can't afford to use.
I ain't trying to be a dick. But the satellite is pretty much useless in a dirt poor country with low educated citizens. Not to say that it's not where it's needed most.

Simple. It's a complicated as fuck computer internet currency that 95+% of your basic bitch crowd don't know or care anything about beyond drugs, computer viruses and money laundering.
And obviously, crypto pretty much shares a bed with the 90% male dominated IT Industry.
How can you expect basic bitch betty to care about Bitcoin when just mentioning nodes, spv wallets and memonic seed phrases is enough to make her audibly huff, sigh and even nauseate her. If she's lucky enough to get through that, the only reward for her effort is being able to buy clothes online with that Bit-Coin thing she learned about.

That exchange looks really cool. I'll definitely be using that. Thing is though, eclair on Android (as I understand it) isn't capable of running full channels. Thus can only send and not generate payment invoices.

This, and making sure that whatever your plan is, it cannot be disrupted by the courts searching objects in your home, seizing and exploiting your devices, etc.
Make a password or something. Keep it in your head. Don't forget it. Don't tell anyone. 
Without a private key, people looking to take your coins can pound sand. 
Drug dealers get their coins auctioned because they don't plan on the cops taking the ledger recovery sheet, paper wallet, or whatever they have in their home. Once they got that, it's game over.

Isn't the traceability of current transactions been debunked with updated mixins and bulletproof adoption and other changes in the software? 
I definitely agree on transaction speed though.

I will never accuse women of being unintelligent as a whole. Just that they have socially accepted wilful ignorance as a general standard at no fault of their own.
Put simply, when parents raise women to exhibit the behaviour they expect women to have, we cannot be surprised when they themselves grow up to expect that behaviour from themselves and more importantly each other.
While acceptance has grown since the 90's and earlier, many people out there will think it's weird for a woman to be "neckbeard" deep into computers and code, unless it's accompanied by an exceptionally paying job.
No one here is patting themselves on the back and jeering that crypto is a boys only club. It's just painful to watch one of the 1 in 10 women that are into crypto talk and rant like it's actually 4-7 in 10 and we just haven't realized it or something, when this is demonstrably false. 
Like the internet, it will become more accepted when the general public can use it and forget all the complicated aspects like nodes, full nodes, mnemonic seed phrases, lightning nodes, lightning channels, Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, 2nd layers etc. even exist at all, and works in a way that the system doesn't shit itself if the average joe/jane doesn't understand what they are or how they work when storing and transacting funds.
@_date: 2019-01-01 01:25:21
Aside from the fact mobile wallets can't receive lightning payments and not being able to add funds to existing channels, what drawbacks or limitations does the lightning network have?
Also, if I pay a merchant and they decide they want to settle my funds on chain who pays the on chain fee? Does my channel remain active with my remaining funds left in the channel? Or does the other party settling on chain kill my channel and force me to pay for a new one?
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:39:32
But Bitcoin cannot do that without lightning network. The current transaction rate couldn't support a single industry worldwide, much less the entire global commodities market. 
The lightning network still needs more time to be effective.

It's an interesting idea, but I'm not sure if it's possible (obviously)
6 lowercase letters a-z makes for 308,915,776 possibilities alone. Before the base and exponent pair at single digit ups that to 30,891,577,600 assuming zero is a possible outcome.
Even with a lower pair than what you recommend with single digit base and exponent pair it could take 293,869 years to discover the key even if each key generation took 5 minutes instead of the many days you suggest for a properly long base and exponent pair.
@_date: 2019-09-29 08:27:14
Isn't Breez custodial LN?
@_date: 2019-09-01 18:43:45
Theoretically the easiest way to brute force would be almost sequentially, which is to say every combo of 6 lowercase letters with base exponent of 1\^1, working your way up to 9\^9. If the case is lower than it will be found faster, if it's 9\^9 it will take significantly longer.
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:25:10
\&gt;That's ridiculous, Bitcoin has a ton of use cases, but being hard money is probably the most profound.
Any that involve the customer spending or moving his funds waiting days and weeks for the transaction to process? It seems like your "hard money" serves a minority of people.
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:34:27
Bitcoin is broken and anything that claims to fix it is a scam.
Scream LN is the only solution all you want. Won't stop the blocks from capping out and the fees becoming prohibitive to entry. After that I guess either people with problems are just too stupid or not rich enough and we need to functionally gatekeep Bitcoin now to the nerds and whales.

Your going to need an alternative. Lightning Network isn't good enough. 
You can't even open a channel to use the lightning network with less than 20 USD. You cannot top up existing channels, and you have to make a exact request in satoshis to receive a payment in a lightning channel. You can't just receive satoshis in a lightning address like you would with on-chain funds. You cannot use the lightning network on exchanges to deposit or withdraw, meaning you cannot escape paying on chain fees. You also must pay a network fee every time you open and close a channel, you can't sell your coins without closing a channel as we discussed earlier and you cannot top up a channel without closing the existing channel.
Altcoins are ready TODAY, \*effective\* layer 2 solutions that actually fix the above problems are still in development, not in development or not known to be possible as of yet.
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:55:17


There will need to be. People forget that Bitcoin used to be used and intended rightly so for payments. This store of value and hard money only concept only came around when the fees started to become a problem.
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:52:16
People will be forced to pay more if they want into the next block. You will always be competing for that 1 MB of space every 10 minutes. Normal people aren't willing to wait 24+ hours to move their money, that's why they hate ACH in traditional banks.
Your also forgetting that while someone waits 24 hours or more for their 10 sat/byte tx to get a block, the backlog will continue to grow and grow until it can never be cleared. Days turn to weeks and weeks turn into months. It never gets this far because everyone loses confidence and sells their holdings, just look at the blocks going from August to December 2017. It hits a wall and the price collapses.
You wanna use Litecoin instead of evil bcash? That's perfectly fine. I don't care what it is dash, ripple, nano whatever shitcoin of the week. But stop pretending that BTC is useful for anything than squatting on exchange hotwallets or hiding million dollar trust fund from the IRS.

You'd pay $40 fees for an $80 purchase?  On Lighting Network?
I'm talking about off-chain.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:43:40
So people are using Bitcoin for something it's not designed for in your opinion, and it's going to break under capacity for anyone with less money than fees, and no you won't change to fix the problem because it's not your problem?
That does make sense. What doesn't make sense is why there are so many transactions at all. Is it really commerce? If it is don't people realize it's a bad idea to conduct commerce on the BTC blockchain? Are people just aimlessly moving their money to new addresses for no reason?
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:30:24
Well, it's not having coding errors and shit no. So any code that functions is technically not broken.
But for anyone who actually buys anything with Bitcoin, it's effectively broken as a currency because it's too cost prohibitive to use. 
It's like slamming a game critic for calling a game character broken when the code clearly works fine.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:09:43
So you disagree that Bitcoin is a peer to peer electronic cash system? 
Or are you implying that an electronic cash system does not imply the inclusion of payments in it's purpose and function?
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:10:27
ACH isn't fine, but I'll chalk that up to an irrelevant disagreement. In the description you provide, BTC's only usefulness is a *theoretical* hedge against inflation (We still have yet to see if inflation can outpace volatility over longer periods). Generally any altcoin can do that *and* have good transaction speed to enable more use-cases. That being said i do agree that stable consensus rules are important, something that some altcoins *cough* bcash *cough* are just ignoring that for the sake of unstable upgrades and bullshit addons to fight forks (checkpoints).
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:56:45
If it's so ready how come no one can use it without the issues I mentioned and retailers don't want it either for those same reasons? Exchanges? 
Coinbase? Nope. Gemini, nope, Kraken, nope, Binance nope. 
Nothing. Even right now unless the exchange covers the withdrawal your paying $4 just to get your coins to a wallet and open a channel. $4 every time you acquire funds. If your from a poor country your fucked.
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:30:28




Bullshit. Show me one in the last week that went through in less than 10 blocks.
@_date: 2019-05-16 00:51:49
Yes. I'm just concerned that the wallet won't let you open a channel with less than 300,000 satoshis, which isn't bad now but could be after a bull run.
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:41:01

@_date: 2019-05-15 21:30:43
You act like any other altcoin would implode under BTC's load. It wouldn't, in fact they could offer sub cent fees and still chug along at the height of transaction count.
And while LN is a shitty payment system in commerce the businesses make the decision for you. Very few sites accept lighting payments compared to traditional on-chain payments. I don't see that changing.
@_date: 2019-05-16 00:09:25
Hmm. Interesting.
Does BTC have schnor signatures yet?
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:18:09
It isn't ready for them to use. Else they would have been using it by now, hell they haven't even announced that they are going to implement. I've heard others say that LN isn't a good idea for exchanges due to how it works.
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:50:37
So long as bitcoin is undervalued and in low demand fees will be affordable. But simply put either you can have affordable transactions or a globally adopted $20k+ bitcoin. You can't have both with a 1mb cap and LN.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:14:54
The same reason any transaction needs to be recorded. Why is a lambo purchase more important than a coffee purchase?
Banks already do this. Are banks more efficient than blockchains? Probably.
Both will cause problems if they go unrecorded.
