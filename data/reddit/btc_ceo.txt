All American companies are at risk of being forced to include backdoors through secret court orders and NSLs. But so are Chinese ones, for example...  
That being said, I do not believe this is the case with Dell. If you read [the article]( linked to from the original post, the guy who reported this complains about a JTAG header on Dell's servers and that Dell's customer service twitter account responded with "sorry for the inconvenience" when he exposed the situation... IMO, the JTAG doesn't matter: if you can not ensure your server's physical security, how can you secure the information stored in it?

It seems like a pretty good idea at first but... Why would a bunch of companies give up their employee and supplier lists to see who accepts Bitcoin? Honestly, it probably wouldn't even be legal in many countries due to privacy laws (unless there was explicit legal consent, of course). And do you really think many individuals would register on such a system? I know I wouldn't.
Honestly I don't think we should care so much about companies - especially large ones - converting it into fiat at this point. Keeping Bitcoin is obviously a risk most companies are not willing to take and, at this point, it would really provide no benefit to them; let's be honest.  
Once adoption is widespread and enough employees/suppliers are willing to take it, then they will start keeping at least part of their revenue in Bitcoin. For now we should just be wishing more large companies accept it, even if they convert it all to fiat... Once you can actually buy a wide range of stuff with Bitcoin consumers will jump in.

You may only have to pay taxes if there is an appreciation in value between when you acquired the BTC and when you spend/sell it.




In a way, cash is more untraceable and thus dangerous in that regard since you don't know who and when it is transferred to, whereas with Bitcoin you have the public Blockchain which records all transactions. It is however pseudonymous and can be anonymous if used correctly, although cashing out large amounts untraceably is very difficult... Anyway, billions of dollars are already transferred covertly over borders - both in cash and through wire transfers (e.g. fake companies, offshore accounts) - every year.


I see that as a good thing and many Bitcoin users do as well. Many countries have continued inflation due to the government printing currency (more like creating a few 1s and 0s in a computer, actually) whenever they need money. This endless money creation makes the money you own less valuable over time. Many governments also enact stupid regulations that limit you in how much money you can have and how you can use it, even if you're a law-abiding citizen.

Tor can be thought of as a decentralized VPN. It is, however, limited in terms of latency, speed and trust (regarding the exit nodes). It would be interesting if a similar system was developed while allowing the relay and exit nodes to receive an incentive (based on usage time or bandwidth used). Trusting the exit nodes would still be a problem, but we should be using encryption for any sensistive stuff, anyway.

Can't tell if trolling or not...
Anyway, if it's savings that you are keeping, why not use a paper wallet? Download the code, boot up a secure offline computer with a Linux LiveCD or USB drive, print a few BIP-38 encrypted wallets, transfer your funds and that's it. Keep the paper wallets in multiple, secure places - and possibly online (use another layer of encryption) and you don't have to worry about your funds being stolen.  
Then just keep your spending money on a light client (Mycelium, Breadwallet, Multibit...) or online wallet (Coinbase, Circle, etc). If you want to move large amounts securely, get a Trezor.
EDIT: Also, just so you know, there is nothing wrong with using the blockchain bootstrap torrent - the client still verifies each block. But bear in mind that keeping bitcoin on your computer is not nearly as secure as in a paper wallet, Trezor or even some third-party services such as Coinbase's Multisig Vault - not because of the client but because any computer is vulnerable to virus and other threats.

OpenSSL had many eyes on it, but only one full-time developer and over 450k lines of code. Last I checked, Bitcoin had ~200k LOC and the critical stuff is a small portion of that.  
Also, IMHO the risk with Bitcoin is stronger in the way that it is more direct (i.e. any serious issues could lead to someone creating money - bitcoin - from nothing, disrupting the system, etc.) which leads to more scrutiny of those critical bits of code.

If you're concerned about storing it for a long time then this could be a better option, since OP_RETURN (the method used in ProofOfExistence) is pruneable. Plans are that in the future most nodes will only store [unspent transaction outputs]( instead of every transaction. Since OP_RETURN can never be used as an input for another transaction, nodes can choose not to store it.
However please use this method responsibly, choosing OP_RETURN whenever possible, to minimize blockchain bloating.

Flash is quite stable, but it needs some power to retain the data. If the drive is left unpowered for extended periods of time, the probability of data loss increases.

Enterprise SSDs can lose data in a week, but only when operating them at low temperatures and the storing at high temperatures (which is an unlikely scenario). Take a look at slide 27 of the [presentation]( for actual figures.

A few points:
* Don't buy 10K worth of bitcoin through an ATM. It'll be cumbersome (if not impossible) and you'll pay a large markup which you can save by using a reputable exchange instead (e.g. Kraken, Coinbase...)  
* No need to buy a new computer if you have an old one lying around. Just boot off a Linux live CD and make sure it's not connected to any networks. I personally use an old Celeron desktop I had lying around unused.   
* When you generate your new wallet through bitaddress, use the BIP38 Encrypt option. Provided you use a strong passphrase, this should defeat even the most dedicated adversaries (though you are still vulnerable to the [$5 dollar wrench]( attack).  
* Extra, optional security step: add another layer of encryption (e.g. AES encrypted zip file) before storing the file in the cloud  
* Print the wallet on paper, with multiple copies, instead of (or in addition to) using a USB drive as it can fail. Store the copies at multiple, secure locations (bank safe, buried in the back yard, relative's house...)  
* Depending on how significant that amount is for you and how paranoid you are, consider using multi-sig and distributing the keys over multiple locations.
@_date: 2014-06-28 01:59:55
Although I don't agree, that's a fair point. 
But I'm sure you'll agree that the vast majority of Bitcoin users share some beliefs, among which: Bitcoin should provide a means of payment and store of value that is safe from excessive government/corporate oversight and interference. This is done through decentralization and pseudonymity. 
We all know goverments don't always do the right things in regards to their citizens' liberty (be it for economical interests, political reasons, whatever) so freedom from government, banks and corporations is something that most users really appreciate. Waters is trying to both centralize this process on his platform and remove the pseudonymity, undermining this important aspect of Bitcoin. 
If it goes against the majority's shared beliefs, it's no good in my opinion...

In my experience, and according to common guidelines, data center temperatures generally range between 21 and 24C. However, I know of datacenters running at temperatures of up to 30C, in a bid to save power (with no adverse results AFAIK). According to the table in the presentation a possible scenario of an Enterprise drive running at 30C and then stored at 30C would retain data for 4 weeks. 
If you're pulling the drive from a machine in the datacenter, you're probably not going to be storing it in a very hot place anyway. Not seeing any common scenario where it would be stored above 30C (unless somebody's leaving it in the car during summer...).

1. You should set your rates in whatever fiat currency you use, and convert that into BTC using the exchange rate at the time. If you want to simplify the process and avoid the volatility completely, then you can accept payment through third-parties like BitPay and Coinbase who can instantly convert all payments into your currency, and transfer it to your bank account every day. Also, you can choose to keep a percentage of your income as bitcoin (e.g. 80% fiat, 20% bitcoin) instead of converting all of it.  
2. You can offer discounts or extras, for example. After all, you benefit from it since it's instant and irreversible (yay, no more fees, chargebacks or frozen accounts!)  
3. Don't make too much of a fuss about it, just list it alongside your usual payment methods. Or include it in your newsletter, or mention it casually to clients.  
4. Since Bitcoin is treated as a commodity for tax purposes, if it increases in value between the time when you receive/buy it and when you sell it then you have to pay capital gains tax. If you convert it to fiat instantly, then you needn't worry about this.

Build quality is great for both, display quality is very similar, the Mac's CPU is slightly better and so is its graphics card.

It's not like you can simply charge their Bitcoin wallet and it wouldn't be reasonable to demand a large enough deposit (say $200) to cover this stuff.
Yes, there are ways to circumvent these issues but it's just not practical, especially at Uber's scale. I do hope they prove me wrong though!

You could for instance use PBKDF2 with:  
- A strong passphrase  
- A short password as salt (or something easy to remember such as your address, SSN, email or a combination thereof)  
- A PIN which will be used to determine the number of iterations (preferrably a value &gt; 50k)
This should make it next to impossible to crack your brainwallet even if your main passphrase is relatively low entropy, unless it is a very targeted attack. I actually wrote a Linux CLI app which I use for this purpose.

I assume you're not very familiar with Bitcoin, so I would suggest you first take a look at [bitcoin.org]( and its [getting started page]( to understand the overall idea and how you can get set up with a wallet and make transactions.
The 200 bits (millionths of a bitcoin) sent you are probably only enough to  make one or two transactions as you need to pay a small fee (worth a couple of cents) to make each transaction. However, this should be enough for you to move some bitcoin around and understand the concept - fast, low-cost and irreversible world-wide transactions where you don't even need to know who the other party is. Also a good store of value because it's deflationary and decentralized, meaning no central actor can "die", go bankrupt, debase the currency or freeze/steal anyone's money.  
For practical uses (with a larger amount of bitcoin) you can buy [domain names]( [airline tickets]( [Amazon stuff with 5-20% off]( [Starbucks with 20% off]( [Dell hardware]( [furniture]( or visit [brick and mortar shops]( Adoption by merchants is still limited, but getting stronger.

Bitcoin doesn't die like that. We've got thousands of CEOs, like heads on a hydra. And you're one of those heads too.

Be aware that Coinbase will close your account at the first sign that you may be operating as an unlicensed money transmitter. They've done so many times in the past.

Asymmetrical encryption is public-key cryptography. And hashing is not encryption anyway.

I would suggest that you do not pay it. There is no guarantee that they will not continue hitting your site and demanding more money.
How long has your site been getting hit? Have you considered using a service like Cloudflare or getting proper DDoS protection, as in a hardware firewall (expensive but can be worth it if it the site is sufficiently large)?
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:02:40
No, they can't. The private keys never leave your device.  
The main difference is that light wallets use [Simplified Payment Verification]( which means that they only download block headers instead of full blocks.

I'm on the same boat. I received a similar message on an e-mail address I've used for BTCJam but not localbitcoins...  
Maybe localbitcoins was compromised, but it seems like perhaps BTCJam was too.

Depends on the hash algorithm, but it's easy to do from a shell. For example, to generate a SHA-1 hash:  
- Open a Terminal  
- Change to the directory where you have the file, e.g.: cd ~/Downloads/  
- Type: sha1sum bitaddress.zip

Yep, I agree... The U.S. government too is quite terroristic, and terrorism-generating and many Americans would probably view it as such if they lived in one of the countries they've attacked over the years.  
Here's an interesting quote from Robert Pape ([source]( a political scientist who has studied these matters for a while and published a few books:

Yes, there are others. Namely BitPay, Circle, itBit, Blockchain.info, Bitnet, Xapo, BitGo and KncMiner. All of which agreed to support BIP101 by December 2015.

Sorry, I looked it up in Google and apparently it was an old version. Here's the updated, PGP-signed, changelog:   
Also, notice that the hash algorithm for the latest releases changed to sha256. So, in order to compute the hash on your system you should run the sha256sum command instead of sha1sum.  
You should be checking the HTML file, by the way.

Cool project. However, with the reference implementation released under the GPL v3 probably no proprietary software will ever support it so this is little more than that, a cool project.

If Bitcoin succeeds, as most of us here believe it will, this is definitely a good time to buy as the price will rise substantially (current market cap is ~$4 billion, which is very very small). It might fail though so do some research, make your own decision, don't expect quick returns and most importantly do not invest what you can't afford to lose.

Brazil is a large, developing economy with strong capital controls and plenty of skilled immigrants so it's an excellent place for Bitcoin to flourish!

Here's a good source:  ~~ (old)  
The above link contains the version history, with the SHA1 or SHA256 for each release. The latest version's SHA256 hash is: 2c5d16dbcde600147162172090d940fd9646981b7d751d9bddfc5ef383f89308  
Aside from being served by the original website over a HTTPS connection, it is also PGP signed by the author. So if you are extra paranoid, verify the PGP signature (by checking it on other sites or via web-of-trust) before trusting the hashes on the file.

What kind of bandwidth would nodes charge for though? Relaying transactions or something else?
@_date: 2015-10-19 19:54:48
Yes, exactly. Those words include all the information needed to recover your wallet in Electrum (or many other wallets).
@_date: 2015-03-02 09:05:34
Well that's why most services wait for at least 1 confirmation. Some payment processors such as Bitpay accept unconfirmed transactions, provided those transactions follow some rules that minimize the possibility of never confirming or being double-spent (including having a sufficient fee).

They don't fake their volumes, they simply have no trading fees...

Since you mention that you just learned that PC mining is useless, I suppose you are new to Bitcoin. If you expect to make a profit from small scale mining, I'm sorry to disappoint you but that is not going to happen (unless you have free electricity). You're better off buying Bitcoins at a reputable exchange.  
If you are sure you want to get into mining (please research this really well) my advice is don't fall into preorder scams. Only buy stuff that is ready to ship.
