I think there will be a final shakeout, with the actual low being at 2500. No chance we get much above 6k without a final battle though.

the number 6000 does not get plucked from ones ass.
6k is most significant price point for bitcoin over the last 2 years. For years 6k was considered very cheap for BTC and buyers always drove the price up every time btc got near that value. Now its perceived as too expensive at this price which will now cause the market to get rekt. 
There is next to no choice that price doesnt have a major reaction here

because it relates to the subject? Ever heard of a technical drawing, perhaps from an architect - same thing.

we are still in a weekly bear market until we close above 6k. If we break through 6k and hold, then I will concede the bull market has now taken control, but I'll be amazed if the bears dont resume the selling in this price area for a final push down (before the ultimate bull market arrives).

obvious level is obvious

\~6k is a price ceiling for now, now we head back down to new lows.

supply and demand is indeed a thing

bye bye bitcoin, see you at 2500
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:32:41
so really the only thing that's important to you here is the definition of the word technical? perhaps wikipedia can help

I'm not in the market, I've been waiting for price to hit 6k, for the final push down, then I'll be buying. I know everyone really really wants price to go up, but market forces are a thing, and selling is going to come into play now and we will go back down. But btc will go boom later, just not now.

6k is at a very significant technical level. 5k was just a big round number - big difference
