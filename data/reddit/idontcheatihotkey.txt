This one time, At band camp, Bitcoin crashed all the way to $1!

Hardforking the chain was a win for everyone. The Ethereum chain is 11gb. It's faster, more secure and has lower fees.
How does it make sense in anyones head for a coin that is far from the best to hold the biggest market cap. It is not the fastest, not the most secure, doesn't have the best privacy and does not have the best fees.

Altcoins rised alongside Bitcoin.
Bitcoin takes a hit then so do Altcoins.
Bitcoin itself will continue to fall and Altcoins may recover.
Bitcoin can't hold the biggest market cap. It doesn't make sense for a crypto that is not the fastest, most secure and future proof coin to hold the top spot.

Oh my goodness. I must find one of these rare, ancient artifacts.

BTC is gone. We all know the technology of BTC is not viable for the masses. It's been pitched as something it's not.
Altcoins will take a small hit from this but they will recover.
Bitcoin dies, Altcoins rise.

ahhaahahahahaha True, true

The people that you are talking about include the co-founder of bitcoin.com

If only people understood that bitcoin cannot be "The future of currency" that they want it to be. Yes blockchain technology has the potential to be the future of currency. Bitcoin itself doesn't.
I don't know how it makes sense in anyone's head the a crypto that is far from the fastest, most secure and future proof crypto can hold the biggest market cap. It is bound to fall.

Hit the nail on the head.

Everyone wants the end goal of a decentralized network. Bitcoin cannot reach that end goal that everyone wants. That is the problem. It was a good display of the potential of blockchains but bitcoin itself is not capable of being the viable currency that everyone wants it to be.

You can come back in one year and mock me if the price has gone up because it just makes the repercussions worse for the fall of this coin. 
How can it make sense in anyones head for a coin that is not the fastest, most secure, private and future proof coin to hold the highest market cap? It's bound to fall. The only reason the coin has hit the price it has is because of mainstream media dribbling garbage about it being the "future of currency" when it can't live up to that.

It could hit 10tb and it wouldn't matter. Storage on devices is only getting bigger and it is much easier to build applications for the ethereum blockchain. Meaning you can access the blockchain without downloading the whole thing since anyone can host the chain and allow people to access it through their interface.
How is Ethereum a scam? It's a blockchain. How can a blockchain be a scam? Under your logic Bitcoin is a scam. The only scam is mainstream media pushing down peoples throat that bitcoin is "The future of currency" when it doesn't have the capacity to achieve that. It cannot become mainstream. The fees are only going to get higher and the transaction times are only going to get slower.
Blockchains do have potential to be the future of currency. Bitcoin itself does not.

You haven't explained any arguments for why it is a scam chain. You've literally just called it a scam for no reason. 
A premine for a coin like Ethereum is nothing. It has no max supply so that premine will eventually end up insignificant in the long run. The developers deserve some coin for their own chain.

"If the fundamental tech behind Bitcoin fails, altcoins (which are based on the same fundamentals) don't stand a chance in hell."
That is like me saying "If Dinghies can't handle rough swell then Oil Carriers (which are based on the same fundamentals) don't stand a chance in hell."
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:46:26
I explained the situation.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:28:48
People still store money in bank accounts? The interest on those suck.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:29:56
What trade-offs? What does bitcoin have over Ethereum for example?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:34:04
Haha cheers!
I'm still waiting for comments from uneducated people with half their salary invested, telling me how bitcoin is going to hit a million.
