BashCo, just because one of the 30Million US based developers doesn't pass your smell test, does not mean others need feel the same as you.
I respect your opinion, and the fact you are (while abrasive) providing a service to our community by protecting them to potential threats (not saying he injected a rootkit or some backdoor, whereas some reverse shell spawns every night @ 3am) just saying, if it was malicious in nature, why would he use something with a public toolkit such as GDAX/Coinbase? Why wouldn't he spend his time on much easier avenues for conning people... like Bitconnect :]
Anyhow, great work Mr. Harrison. I have an office in SF, as well a colleague that heads the startup/crypto division of SVB. I would like to take you up on that coffee offer, please PM me if you get this.

If you do not have a background within HTML/Bootstrap/Php/Java/Jquery/Python/C etc...   Please before installation of, and or downloading any installable app, desktop platform software of any flavour',  etc..  please post on a public forum &amp; or reddit question, even Quora is better than nothing -- John McAfee designed a marketing campaign long ago, before Virus &amp; Malware were even truly a global threat;  He is the first and primary reason we today have to safeguard ourselves against individuals and teams that are non-stop scanning IP ranges for service packs, vulnerable software ports of which have not been changed manually, the threats are real and they are many.
Feel free to PM me, or BashCo directly if you would like advice moving forward. We cannot allow our small, yet ever expanding community of crypto-traders and hodl'ers to become victim to this dangerous land we call the interwebs.
Live long. Prosper, and masturbate on the daily.
Yours truly,
jB
