It's important to remember the context of that quote if you're going to use it. The character who spoke was a wizard (more accurately, an angel), one of the highest status beings of his world. He knew very well that once the humans started taking things apart to find out how they worked, they'd develop science, and then they wouldn't be so weak and ignorant any more. They wouldn't be beneath him.
So yes, of course he disliked the idea. Doesn't mean it was a bad one.

They're missing a space for a signature.
Paper wallets are not like banknotes. You can't pass them through many hands and still trust them, because anyone in the chain could have kept a copy of the private key, and the coins could disappear out of the wallet a minute after you do the verification scan. The only way they can work for payment is if they're like checks: they have the customer's signature on them, acknowledging that the debt is his, so if the money turns out not to be there in the account, you can go back to him and demand he make alternative arrangements to pay the debt.

When the rule of law breaks down, you're going to get a very nasty surprise at just how inedible your gold is. If you think it's going to happen in your lifetime, you should be stockpiling canned food, medical supplies and ammunition, not soft yellow metal.

Better to learn that the value of speculative investments can go down as well as up, while you're young and the amounts at stake are small.

While I agree with you about the injustice of the law involved, that conclusion is overly pessimistic. While the functionality of brain hardware starts being compromised within a few minutes of oxygen deprivation, cryonic preservation doesn't rely on the original hardware to stay intact. It only relies on the information continuing to exist in some form, which is a far more robust condition, and seems reasonably likely to hold in cases like this.

Spectator here, but it seems to me the answer should be yes: if all of the allegations are true, the fairest possible outcome would be for Ulbricht to be acquitted on the drug charges and convicted on the attempted murder charges.

In the same way that getting your wallet stolen at the bus station is why people choose not to keep their entire savings in paper money in their wallets, yes.

My opinion for what its worth is that it's a good idea to open source everything nontrivial you write *unless* you have specific business reason not to.

It makes sense, but it won't help much with this kind of case. There just isn't any way to secure property you leave at home, against a thief who is living in your home, at least not if the thief knows what he's doing.
If you have to share accommodation with quasi-strangers and you are going to put significant amounts of money into bitcoin, I would suggest a safety deposit box, asking family members to hold keys for you, or both.

I'm going to disagree with the other posters on one thing. I think it would be a great idea to buy a GPU mining rig _as a pilot project_.
Thing is, a million quid is too much to spend in one shot before knowing what you're doing. The last thing you want to do is follow some of the other advice and buy that much bitcoin and then wake up a week later to find you only got your security 99% right, somebody hacked your wallet and the money is all gone.
So if you get on the phone to Avalon or Butterfly or whoever and get the ball rolling on the ASICs, I would recommend spending maybe a few grand on a good GPU rig in the meantime to generate some bitcoins, not for the purpose of profit but for the purpose of learning the ropes and making your mistakes while it's cheap.

Then your problem is not "I can't buy bitcoins". It's not even "I can't buy drugs."
It's "my life and my relationship with my parents is so screwed up on both sides that they regard me as a slave in chains".
That's the thing you need to work on fixing.

She's documenting the learning process. There are plenty of expert guides to bitcoin on the web already. The whole point of the story is that it's a documentary of a layman's experiences as she goes along. That's what I find interesting about it.

While I am not convinced that the complete abolition of government would be feasible and desirable (instead, I advocate smaller government), it is worth noting that the reason employees continue to work for assholes is because they're afraid they won't be able to get another job. Why? Because employers are scarce. Why? Because there are very high legal barriers to employing people. Why? Well the ghastly joke is that most of the anti-employment legislation was passed in the sincere belief that it would protect workers. In fiction, good intentions are usually a guarantee of ultimate good results. In real life... not so much.

I sympathize, but honestly I couldn't help wincing because while the two of you were doing a great job posting as though you were trying to win an argument against other geeks, salesmanship to an audience of neurotypical skeptics is another matter altogether.
Did you notice the way the arguments presented against bitcoin didn't make any logical sense? Now it's tempting to conclude from that, that you're dealing with a bunch of idiots, but it's much more likely what's going on is that the skeptics' real position is that their previous encounters with bitcoin advocates tripped their kook/fanatic detectors - maybe wrongly or maybe rightly given the talk you sometimes see about how bitcoin is going to destroy all governments and usher in Utopia, hallelujah Amen, but be that as it may - and those detectors are still going off, and that's what they are really saying. The words are just a carrier wave you have to look past.
What that means in practice is you have to *dial it down*. A lot. I'm not saying you were impolite or unreasonable or anything. I'm saying for effective salesmanship in this kind of context *you still have to dial it down a lot more* - which includes letting the other side have the last word.

It may be worth keeping in mind that this theory only works while so few people use bitcoin that physical criminals don't find it worthwhile to learn about. If everybody was using bitcoin, physical criminals would steal it with rubber hose cryptography, so everybody would find it necessary to store their bitcoins in banks, just as they found it necessary with their gold coins centuries ago; banks could fail, so government insurance was needed for same; around it goes.

Thinking a little more about this. In the case of Iceland and Ireland at least, what extent would it be accurate to describe them as stateless versus loose collections of very small states? Was it not the case that each patch of territory was defended by a clan or whatnot that claimed authority over it?

Do you have links handy on that? Last I heard, it wasn't public knowledge just how many or how few terrorist attacks had been prevented by NSA spying, but maybe there is new information on the matter that I had missed?

It's been a long time since I read about Dark Ages Europe, and I don't have references still to hand, but your examples are interesting; I might look into them further. Thanks!

Be that as it may, risking your life for money you don't need, as DPR was doing, is a high price to pay for annoying bobbyt2012.

Your first claim has me curious. The stateless societies I know about, e.g. 1990s Somalia or Dark Ages Europe, have had higher rates of violence than comparable states, and life therein has tended to be nasty, brutish and short, which is why I'm a minarchist rather than an anarchist; but perhaps there are others I don't know about. Which ones are you thinking of?

Some of the commenters on the forum thread seem to still subscribe to the bizarrely stupid meme that it's the user's fault for not enabling 2fa.
Here's a question for those people: Say you hire a plumber to install a tap in your kitchen. Everything seems to be fine until he's out the door, then that evening you find your kitchen is ankle-deep in water. You get on the phone the plumber and he says too bad, you didn't specify you wanted a *washer* in the tap.
The whole "ha ha, it's your fault for not being an expert in this technical specialty" would be a lot less funny if it happened to be a specialty other than yours, wouldn't it?
Operators of websites storing digital cash equivalent need to disabuse themselves of the idea that they can provide 2fa as an option. It needs to be mandatory.

The third step could surely be abbreviated to say one day of load testing in the current situation where your live system is, er, not passing its load test, so to speak.
Couldn't the first step be abbreviated to a couple of hours by having somebody drive out to a vendor and pay over the counter for a few servers? Perhaps it would cost a little more for the required configuration, but that would surely be orders of magnitude cheaper than having a multimillion dollar business grinding to a halt.

"most people do not have an extra computer that can be permanently left offline"
That is true only because most people don't currently have use for such; it's not a natural condition like not having an extra head. For the price of a handful of bitcoins, it's easy enough to buy a cheap Linux laptop for that purpose.

Giving a massive discount to large corporations is a terrible strategy as of all your potential customers they have the most money and the lease price sensitivity. I don't know what arrangements you should make for, or what incentives you should provide to use, bitcoin, but whatever you do end up with, I think should be made just as available to individuals and small businesses as large corporations.

Most people can't read people anywhere near as well as they think they can. Sure, that's not a universal rule; I've met a _very_ few whose intuitions about people turn out to be mostly accurate. Maybe 5% of the population. I'm guessing maybe half the people reading this comment are thinking they personally are in that 5%, and one in ten are right. The rest of us need to beware of trusting such intuition too much.

A number of things can happen if you go for therapy, some of them good and some of them bad; at least one study found that on average therapy does more harm than good. I would hesitate to give blanket advice based on looking at only one side of the set of possibilities.

If you could finance the development of moneymaking machines yourself without needing pre-order money, why would you offer the machines for sale at all? Surety it would be strictly better to just keep them all for yourself and pocket the entire profit.

You'll drive yourself crazy thinking like that; there will always be someone who was luckier than you. Lots of people make hefty losses in this kind of investment. If you made a small profit, you're doing a lot better than they did.
