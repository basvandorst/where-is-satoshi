Hi, no I just used your BTC address for direct sending without the need to register anywhere.

if you speak german (or know someone who does - just for setting up the account. Web interface is localizable.) I recommend  
Located in Berlin, small team, no data mining, no advertisements, working close with lawyers to ensure maximum user privacy. Costs 1 Euro per month. You can even pay them by sending money in a letter, if you so  wish :-) (Not BTC unfortunately.)

We were able to easily buy Bitcoin before.. Plenty of exchanges available here. What's the big deal with Coinbase?

Actually only 4 more people are needed.

Yes, agreed. Thanks for explaining and calming me down on this issue!

Great approach!

Thank you for the great explanation! 
But I guess if this quantum attack happens to *any* address it doesn't matter anymore if my address is still safe because bitcoin value will drop way faster than it did this January...

Raiffeisen is shady as fuck. One more reason to leave.

Very cool, I was under the impression that these calculations did not apply to the mythical quantum computer.

What a boring future we live in!
