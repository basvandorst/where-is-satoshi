So you basically ignored everything I said and reaffirmed you have actually no idea how lightning network works.
LN works great on the testnet, because there is infinite bitcoin. No one cares that it costs $25 of play money to open a channel.  
In real world conditions people will find LN doesn't do anything because there's no connections. The tx's won't work.
If you even read the link to my old post, you certainly didn't understand it, at all.
No worries though.

don't anthropomorphize networks dude

Lightning? more like shitning!
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:02:59


A path that had to be created at some point with an on chain tx.


Yes... and this means the network transfer rate will be limited to the median deposits. Even ignoring the 7-8 on chain transactions to set up the network ($200 in today's fees, $2000 in a year from now), The median deposits will be around $1000, so someone who wants to transfer $10k will have to use on chain. 
But even if the median deposit is $1000, the most you can transfer will be $1000 / (# of channels =8), $125. 
LN requires an all or nothing commitment. If a few users half ass it, the network won't work well.

The market has responded by rewarding a currency that works (for the time being). Ethereum.

Read the article I posted.

So.... you admit lightning is useless, why create it in the first place?

Bitcoin transaction fees were $1.6 Billion over the last year.

Lightning network will help big exchanges, but for everyone else, they'll have to trust the exchange.
The cost of opening a channel is so big that only big players with lots of volume can afford it.
So bittrex and coinbase will have a channel, and reduce fees. But you're still buying into those companies profit models.
If coinbase opened up a channel with Amazon, they'd negotiate a fee and pass it on to you.
It's good technology but is not decentralized.

So.... you were using the testnet version of Zap?
Who paid to set up those channels?
Sigh, whatever.  I guess you'll figure it out when it goes live.

I don't like losing my money whenever I get DDOS'd.
I don't want to trust a 3rd party to host my node.
Building a 3rd layer "Watchtower" to guard my money from being stolen is another complex point of failure on top of an already shaky system.
The best scenarios of simulated LN assume that each user has staked 15x as much money in their channels than they use in spending.  
That's right. Assuming the average person can afford $1000 in their channels, the most they could spend is $66.  If they try any bigger, the probability their transaction will fail grows rapidly.
The only situation in which LN helps is where big exchanges (Coinbase &amp; Bittrex) share a channel since they frequently exchange bitcoin.  And this is the scenario in which funds are put into one hot wallet where you don't own your private key.

The point is the "only feasible solution" is ugly. If that's the best bitcoin has to offer, it is going to rapidly fall to dozens of other currencies that have far better solutions to this utter retardation.


Did I say anything about IOTA? Pointing out flaws in another currency doesn't make Bitcoin better.


True, that's why both BTC and BCH are garbage.

Bandwidth is not an issue.  30 TB per year is what is required for VISA's average of 4k tps.
30 TB a year is 15% of a 50 Mbps broadband connection. Sizeable, but easily achievable.
The CPU and RAM is even less of a problem
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:04:27
Let me know how it works out

Much free. Very wow.
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:49:41
The average american has $3000 in their savings account.
The average american would have to commit 1/3rd of their savings into LN channels for it to even allow $66 payments on amazon.
Not going to happen.
Lightning is terrible and its only a matter of time before people here admit it.
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:20:16


You're so smart!  I'll just stop thinking for myself.


LN could be set up in a few ways.
1. Each user sets up N channels, N =~ 6. The graph is decentralized. The downside is your funds are split up 6 ways
2. Each user sets up 1 channel with a central hub. The downside is the central hub needs funds to commit to your channel, in case someone wants to send money to you.
3. Each user actually doesn't have any channels, they have an account with a central hub.  This preserves on chain tx. In order for this to work, users need to send their bitcoin to the hot wallet.  So each hub has 10,000 BTC in their hotwallet, and can easily send large amounts of money to another hub.


I don't think you understand how LN works, or you're not understanding my argument.  LN is just shared addresses.  They don't go "offline".  I'm not talking about the actual LN protocol with time hash-locks and all that. There are technical concerns there, but as far as I'm concerned it seems to work well enough, to assume that it works perfectly. That's not what I'm arguing about.


So i'm having trouble seeing what you're trying to say through all the caps and rage... but are you saying you can move funds from one channel to another without an on chain transaction?  Source?
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:26:43
Mhmm... I'll agree LN has some limited use, between centralized hubs. But Bitcoin is no longer a decentralized, peer to peer currency.
Coinbase could set up a LN channel with Bittrex, and whenever someone moves their money, it'll go faster and cheaper.
Coinbase could set up a channel with TorGuard, but maybe not since they're low volume.
But to benefit from lightning, you must buy into Coinbase's business model. You have no control over your own funds. Coinbase owns the private key.
Currently they don't charge for withdrawals because they still get customers paying 2% to buy bitcoin.
GDAX withdrawals have always been free. That's because they charge 0.3% for buying bitcoin.


Either you weren't using lightning, or someone else set up a channel, meaning you didn't have control over the the funds.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:23:28
Bitcoin is no longer a decentralized, peer to peer currency.
It is a banking system controlled by LN node owners.
It will fail too, because even with LN hubs the costs of sending your bitcoin to the hub are prohibitive. ($18 as of this post, and ever increasing)


@_date: 2018-01-11 01:09:17
No, I understand it perfectly.  Either A, you open your own channel with the hub, creating an opening transaction. And your liquidity will be garbage.  You won't be able to receive much money, only what the hub commits to your channel. Any time you need to refuel, that's another on chain transaction.
Or B, you send your bitcoin to the hub's hot wallet, who has channels open with high liquidity. You're now at the mercy of the hub's banking system.
Lightning does not work in a decentralized way. Either you'll be going over many hops (and limited by the poorest connection), or you'll have your funds spread thin over your several channels.

Do you guys understand? The hacker got away with the money because the hacker is Bitfinex.
They can print an infinite amount of tether and do anything they want with it.
That's why they point you to the address of the "hacked" tether.  They sent it there themselves because it cost them absolutely nothing.
It's to address the coming bank run when people realize they won't give out USD for tether. They pretend like they can't give refunds because the money is lost. 
But in reality they have bought $31 million or more of bitcoin for themselves using their tether printing press. Those who bought tether are left holding the bag.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:20:44
They might have run into a problem.
If the demand for tether drops, and tether users want to exchange for bitcoin, BFX will run into a real problem.
They don't want to give up the millions of bitcoin they stole, so they need an excuse as to why they can't give it back. Enter the bank "hack". The tethers have to be locked up because they were stolen.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:19:19
what do you mean? the only purpose of the locked up tether is an excuse as to why there will be no btc/usdt volume when people try to exit tether.
When people's tether is "lost" they can't trade it back for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:33:27
SELL SELL SELL
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:12:38
The value of the tether is going to drop dramatically once people realize Bitfinex is printing them for their own profit. 
It's the same company. No one audits them but themselves.
It's like having the power of the Federal Reserve, which many Bitcoiners want to escape.  But the Federal Reserve just has a new name, and that is Bitfinex.
The point is scamming people out of their valuable bitcoins for cheap bytes that can be printed infinitely.

i'm not going to waste $20 in tx fees to open channels. I figured you guys love it so much you'd do it.
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:37:16
i hear that a lot, but no one bothers to "correct" me. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:52:42
You're celebrating low fees because people stopped using the network.
There's only 20k tx in the mempool. When the average used to be 100k.
ok found a better source:
1 hour transactions cost 1/7th as much as next block transactions. But when usage is high that means 1 hour transactions are closer to $2 while next block transactions are $14. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:36:13
so you really meant "no".
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:34:35
If you count waiting a month for your tx to clear as acceptable...
also it's pointless to look at the low costs when no one is using the network.
it needs to be able to handle 1k tps minimum and can barely handle 7.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:07:23
That's a non-answer. Prove they can send any meaningful amounts across the network.
as in a large percentage of their channel.
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:55:56
is there a way to see how much money is in each channel?
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:52:30
You're ignoring the real issue.
Can any real volume be transacted over the network?
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:41:52
You mean $4? You missed a decimal place there
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:44:19
There are lots of channels, but how much volume can you send or receive through the network?
Let's say for example WARREN BUFFET wants to send $1 to ANGRY MAESTRO
Each has a channel with SLEEPYARK. warren can send $1 to SLEEPYARK, but SLEEPYARK has channels open with 100 people.  
Is SLEEPYARK 100 times richer than average? his channel can't have much money to ANGRY MAESTRO.
Ok, so lets try to do this with several different channels in separate payments:
WB also uses rompert.com's channel to AM. Rompert also money split over 100 connections.
The total amount you can send to AM is limited by the amount of money SA, rompert, SPOCK, p2sh.info, and ionic release have outgoing to AM's channel.
If I had to bet, that number is near zero.
But I'd love to see where I can see the balance states in each channel
