I would like to give the good news that MS Global Esculation Services assisted me with the Bitcoin transaction issue.
On Friday, Sept 23, I purchased $15 worth of funds with Bitcoin, but the funds were never added to my account.
After many emails with MS Support and BitPay, today, MS credited my account with the $15 I originally purchased and an extra $5 for the trouble.
It was a little pain for a few days, but at the end of it, ended well.

I should have found this post before purchasing MS funds with Bitcoin.
So I went through the process of purchasing $15 of funds for my MS Account and used Bitcoin. Not much, but still, it's $15.
So that the transaction completed when I looked at my BlackChain account and I did receive a BitPay.com invoice with order number and all.
After a few hours, my MS account does not reflect the $15 I purchased.
So I called support. At first I called, they told me to call someone else. Then called that otehr line, they transferred me to another group, which ended up disconnect from me. 
I called a 4th time finally and told Jodie that she's the fourth person I've called. I ran through the process of what I did so she wont be lost. Luckily, she knew what Bitcoin was, unlike the other people I spoke with first.
She took down the bitcoin address from the transaction I saw on my BlockChain account. I was on the phone with her for an entire hour, but still has not been resolved.
She took my information down and escalated the issue.
Now I'm waiting for them to call me back with some answers....hopefully.
