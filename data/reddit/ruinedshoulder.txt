or they can buy back whatever they use. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:12:17
I think it might be time to go all in.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:44:49
That's what I'm saying, it would have to be a simultaneous sell off to have a huge impact
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:29:21
Here comes the wall!
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:19:49
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:36:12
Hoping it settles down right about here.  This ish is a bit too crazy
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:50:41
If the volatility stabilizes, won't the chances of it being a currency for large transactions increase as well? That would mean the value would slowly increase...much slower but more steady, and the fixed supply concept would have more an effect...all just my conjecture. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:57:59
That was fun to watch
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:25:47
That sell wall at 17k is epic, if we break that...lord
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:31:08
Does it get more deceptive and shilly than this?  Jesus Christ.  Stuff like this makes me not want to hold bcash anymore.  I have some, but cotdamn.  Not only that, but it's going to ruin crypto for everyone, especially those in it for investment.  
If bitcoin goes down, we all will likely.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:06:24
I'm not touching my stash.  Screw the whales.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:23:43
Are you talking about lightning network?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:34:53
Nice. I actually bought some alts using my btc today,  wallstreetbets move
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:40:33
Various levels between 1.5-6k
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:24:59
So you foresee a fairly quick rebound?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:24:15
It probably won't be instant.  Would probably take a few hours to get there. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:46:37
I was going to hold my bcash but I just can't do it after hearing this guy and seeing his actions the last few weeks.  I'm done. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:35:12
I dunno a noob. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:23:23
That 17k is a beast
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:18:06
Of course, but I'm talking about the common person
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:17:17
either that or the dip was yesterday, and the price has stabilized for now. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:07:40
back up again?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:03:57
Is this b/c of the Muslim Clerics?  AllahuAkbar!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:54:53
the attention this will get will be great for crypto.  I have no idea what you are on about.  I hear really smart people talking about ether and ripple now...good tech will have it's time. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:29:47
OMG. If there ever was a moon front page, this is it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:27:51
How are we leveling? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:46:40
btc and ltc are very similar from what I understand.  Plus ltc is a lot cheaper so people with less money can get in. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:29:55
lol why isn't this affecting the price?  
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:04:55
Hoping 18.5 is a good power bottom
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:52:48
bubble 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:13:42
How concerned are you guys by the fact that 40% of the bitcoin are held by something like 1000 people? I read this in a FUD and it's a bit concerning. For it to have a huge Domino effect, they would have to sell at the same time, correct?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:56:38
yup, long wait, still haven't seen mine.  I'm using bittrex. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:27:23
this might be the dip lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:15:38
guys it's jumping.  Early trend is pretty clear. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:30:06
probably the Steam news and the Nicehash news.  Altcoins are taking a hit but BTC seems impervious. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:55:13
No regrets. This feels like a once in a lifetime opportunity. No sidelines for me.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:23:19
yeah but is that good or bad.  Usually with stocks or investments, once everyone starts doing it..it turns to rubble.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:35:21
This is a freaking beast.  The world is watching and it's beasting.  This has to be a pretty good sign. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:29:48
lol, look up Roger Ver. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:41:41
Nice. I actually bought some alts using my btc today,  wallstreetbets move
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:57:18
ETH and LTC are not shitcoins bro.  Solid coins imo. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:25:17
Feels like a huge pump by wall street or something
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:56:59
Might have to just buy on coinbase..it locks in the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:14:10
stable but going up little by little.  I'm going balls deep, I'm not gonna miss this and have regrets later.  Better to do a ballsy move and fail than do nothing on the sideline. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:22:05
Really bumpy at around 14k, hopefully it stabilizes 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:41:41
don't return, just hold.  everytime i cash out even more regret
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:29:23
I think it's having problems.  Same thing happened to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:51:22
This might be a dumb question but is there any danger in holding your btc in gdax for a bit?  It's telling me there are delays in sending it back to my coinbase wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:54:38
this has to be 10k for good right?  sheesh
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:57:17
oh yeah, China, good point
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:58:00
It's both.  More and more payment processors are using it, and it's also a store of value.  Both.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:20:14
Thanks.  Yeah I have a trezor, I just didn't want to put it in yet because of this madness going on. I put it on gdax b/c I was ready to panic sell, but did not. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:04:07
Thanks. I just bought one
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:43:51
This blatant pump has to be terrible for bch reputation. What a joke.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:36:28
done that many times...at 2.5...then 3.5...then 8.5.  Just close the window and focus on something else. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:28:56
BCH, what a joke.  I got scared and exchanged my btc for eth at 5400...then i see bch crashing and what happens?  btc goes right back up.  I"m hodling for good now. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:58:01
Will there be fees if I move my btc from coinbase to gemini?  will there be big fees?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:41:38
Valid perspective, but you also have to account for the fact that crypto moves 100x faster. The tech bubble went on for years before it burst. Different rates if you aren't being biased.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:07:42
Honestly though, the Tether news was a legit cause for panic. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:09:48
lol, crypto is most likely just getting started.
