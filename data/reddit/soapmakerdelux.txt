I did that. 3 weeks later I realized my folly and presto-chango’d it back to BTC. This was during a bear stretch and I didn’t make or lose anything significant. I transferred the fiat to my savings account but for some reason my mind didn’t assign that $X any value. It wasn’t FOMO in the sense I understand it. For some reason I would log into Capitol One and make sure my money was still there. It made no sense because I have other money in bank accounts. Truly controlling your assets is a powerful thing.

That’s the key info you didn’t include! When you plug in your Trezor and access your wallet the browser plug-in will tell you if your firmware is out of date. The security code is updated to counter current threats. You won’t lose any crypto by just leaving a hardware wallet in your junk drawer for a few years. The keys remain the same. But it makes more sense to update when able. I plug mine in about every 6 months, only a few minutes to update.

We have been placated by bullshit like the FDIC and the fed. Most people I know can’t even tell me what fees they pay for letting a bank profit off their money.

TL;DR- No shit?! 
Summary of article;
Bitcoin could potentially replace the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency, but for this to happen, the digital currency would need to make progress in several important areas.
Currencies serve as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account. While the U.S. dollar has established itself well in these particular areas, some analysts have voiced their doubts that Bitcoin could fulfill these key roles.
