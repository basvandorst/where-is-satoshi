I compared the checksum &amp; it's fine. Didn't get any miss match.

Problem fixed. Rather than double clicking on that "Bitcoin-Core" icon from Desktop, Clicking on "Devices&gt;Bitcoin-Core" Icon from Finder Window left hand side pan worked. Thanks  for helping hand.

Is it just now released? Because, I'm trying to install it on my Mac OS High Sierra &amp; I'm repeatedly getting this error - **The document "Bitcoin-Core" could not be opened. Finder cannot open files in the "volume" format.** 
Created a post at here : [
Is there anyone else also facing the same issue?

I've downloaded this from - [ Also, 2 times I've downloaded file from that link &amp; tried to opened. But, both the times I was getting the same error. When I'm double clicking on that .dmg file(bitcoin-0.17.0-osx.dmg) , it'm getting one drive icon over of my desktop. Again when I'm clicking on that drive icon it's seems like system getting stuck for 1 sec &amp; nothing is happening.

Yes, I've downloaded from [bitcoincore.org]( this time. But, still getting same error. Checksum also fine.

Problem fixed. Rather than double clicking on that "Bitcoin-Core" icon directly from Desktop, Clicking on "Devices&gt;Bitcoin-Core" Icon from Finder Window left hand side pan worked.

Dammit what was happening I don't know as bit new to this MacOS thing. But, rather than double clicking on that stupid drive icon of "Bitcoin-Core" in desktop... I clicked on the drive icon from left hand side pan from "Devices" section on Finder window &amp; it opened without any error. It's working fine now. Problem fix guys. What a waste of time. -.-

Don't know what's happening. I'm also bit new to this macos thing. Let me restart my system (naive approach to fix). ��

Tried from this source also. But, getting same error. Checksum also fine.
