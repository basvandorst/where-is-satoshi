Then it's a speculator's game as to what is the more reliable store of value over a given time horizon.  Euros, dollars, BTC. The clear advantage of bitcoin would be that the state can't prevent you from moving the funds around. But it's less liquid right now, and less stable in terms of fluctuation as compared to some currencies.

TIL Shooter is a name used by real people, and not just the movie Happy Gilmore.

They said all will be revealed soon. Plus, they're open sourcing all the code. Patience.

Yes, but very common still. As a full time remote worker for a SF tech company, I can relate.

Can someone eli5 this thread please?

So let's assume that I know a decent bit about bitcoin tech, but I don't get into all the drama. Who TF is Garza and how would I or anyone else who doesn't read every thread here even know that this company (or any other for that matter) is a bad place to hold their coins with?

I use only gold plated random number generators.

Reduce through removing middlemen. Not eliminate through magic.

... But it's a decentralized market. What you feel is off-putting doesn't affect me. Maybe a crude hypothetical would be that a drive-through food purchase would require a quick transaction confirmation, therefore all customers at the window would necessarily expect to pay a small surcharge for settlement to function as needed. Someone tell me if this makes any sense, I haven't thought it through.
