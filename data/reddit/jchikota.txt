If you transfer from GDAX, it is free. They cover the transfer fee

I use blockfolio and when I transferred BTC to XRP, there was a button/option to "deduct from holdings" so my BTC holdings reduced the equivalent amount for the XRP that I bought. I don't know about switching exchanges, maybe just sell and buy if it bothers you that much?

Yep, 6pm EST I believe

Goldman Sachs are going to launch a cryptocurrency exchange by this June. I think it could definitely ramp up volume/new users. What are your thoughts?

I downloaded electrum last week. It's pretty straight forward and there's a walk through to help you get set up. As always, make sure you write down your key-words so you can access your wallet if something happens to your computerl

You can transfer your BTC from Coinbase to GDAX (same company) and then you can send them from GDAX to another wallet for free. GDAX covers the transaction fee. Did it for the first time today

Look up Electrum. It is a wallet that can be stored on your computer. While the safest wallets are cold storage wallets (offline, no constant connection to the internet), electrum is a good beginner wallet to use and to get your coins off of an exchange. It's also free.

For me, I had originally put my ID horizontal, and then twisted it to vertical. I also cropped both front/back images to square and it went through that time after trying for a week or so.

Some of those 1000 "people" are exchanges (ex: coinbase) who hold the coins of thousands.
