Break it down- or upwards?

If you put $100 into bitcoin now in one year you’d have $50.
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:34:06
Or 3k
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:59:39
Crashing, buy back in at 5k?
@_date: 2019-04-03 06:13:38
Guys, it’s just another spike on its way to 0, look at the chart.

3K incoming

Glad I sold at 4200
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:34:18
6% - fine to lose that much
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:16:06
I sold at 4200, maybe buy in again at 1000
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:16:17
I see - 100%
@_date: 2018-03-29 01:24:44
7944 - gotcha!
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:08:15
Not true

Sept 2020 - $800
@_date: 2019-09-19 13:29:05
That was the top, now back to 3000

Yes, I got on the list relatively early though. Position 400.000 or so
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:12:07
Robinhood, no fees. It’s not a wallet though, so you can’t transfer coins, but need to buy new ones with $.
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:12:18
This profound TA is further supported by the 4/15 middle finger pattern. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:20:26
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:39:04
Yes. As of now Robinhood has no wallet functionality. You can neither transfer coins to Robinhood from another wallet, nor transfer coins out of Robinhood. You can only buy or sell coins. Only $ (or shares) can be transferred in or out.

Better sell now then before it’s all gone
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:09:06
$1500 by year end, then towards $100

Not today, but soon
