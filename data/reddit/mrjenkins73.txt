Never invest anything you aren't prepared to lose so if you could live with losing some of it if there is a major pull back then go for it. It's fun to play the what if game but Bitcoin has killed it this year and is much higher than pretty much anyone predicted. No one knows what will happen in the short term so it comes down to your own opinion on what the market is gonna do.

Op skins allows you to cash out in BTC, I learned this after losing most of my inventory on roll. Do some research and see what coins you believe in long term and invest in a few.

I agree with you that currently Bitcoin doesn't have that many use cases outside a store of value but it's still early. The run last year was probably too much too quick and now we're in this grey area of overvaluation without valuable products. However the tech is gonna continue to grow and use cases will be created. If you compare it to the internet when it first was being adopted there weren't that many use cases and no one thought it would grow into the tool it is today. Over time people will find more and more ways to use the tech.

Any plan on selling copies or prints in the future?

I agree that btc is useful, don't get me wrong. The problem right now is there are more eyes on btc than actual use cases. Most people aren't using it for transactions but rather as an investment vehicle. In the long run cryptos are here to stay and will become ingrained in our tech but for the short term we're in a grey area of adoption. 
Also you're right that early buyers were buying because they believe in the tech/we're using it as a digital currency. However with all the attention cryptos have gotten in the past year there has been a surge of people buying because they think they will make easy money.
My point to his comment was to try to forget about the volitile price movements and to remember that this tech is only 10 years old and with time adoption and use cases will come.
