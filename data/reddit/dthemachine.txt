From having gone through that experience, what is the best advice you can give or learned, being in the 3rd inning?

They may have been spent. Showed up in my multisyg recovery tool so I thought I had some extra.  I guess not.  Wonder why they would show up there.
Thx anyway

Because it still has not been fully adopted and most people do not really understand it and how money works so they are just focused on price. Soulfede, Do you feel our current monetary system is a better method?
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:07:29
So you feel our current system is better or bitcoin network is better? who is it that you would wish to control it?

The best argument to tell Schiff is there are countless other metals and minerals other than Gold. What makes Gold better?

People's fear is FUD is what's crashing it, not China government.  No one has to sell.

How many alt coins share same properties that make bitcoin the most secure, decentralized and censorship resistant coin with the greatest network effect that is also deflationary?
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:44:53
It is a much better monetary system than anything we have ever had including what we have now.  It is trusted, borderless, decentralized and deflationary.  Unless we are bartering which has its own issues, it is the most effective system for the type of digital world we live in today.  So the value lies in to the extent a person would like to participate in that system.

If governments were to run their own exchanges would that be such a bad thing?  It's actually pretty smart no?  Instead of taxing let them run the exchange and make money of the trade fees as along as they keep the fees reasonable.

I’m buying all the way down until we explode back up and the I’ll probably by all the way up
