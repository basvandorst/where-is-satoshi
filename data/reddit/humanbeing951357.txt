if u are thinking bitcoin is going to be bullish to infinity and beyond, u shud not be in the bitcoin business. buying bitcoin is a gamble just like everything else in life. it takes money to make money. if u cant afford to lose money, then investing in bitcoin is not for u. now whether or not if bitcoin can crash to 90%, it can or it cant, so the smart thing to do is to put in how much u can afford to lose so when it do go down 90% u will lose the money but u wont be homeless. =D
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:05:59
nope lol. just puttin u in ur place and counter arguing with u on the things u said wrong about. ;D
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:23:43
go do ur own research stupid noob.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:53:56
back in 2012 u literally can buy bitcoin from walmart. im serious, thts how i brought it and then i transfer it into the dark market to buy weed. now i also use coinbase and gdax, its really good and convenient. but instead of doing direct transfer, i do coinbase --&gt; personal wallet ---&gt; tumbling ---&gt; dark market. its for security and anonymity reasons.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:34:42
plz do some hw and learn about bitcoin before doin any sort of investing or buying. ure only setting urself up for disappointment if doin tht.
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:52:04

im not worry about getting caught. because i wnt get caught. unless im making billions of dollars and drawing high amount of attention from the government. we have 300 million ppl, the government is not gonna stalk every single person transactions of the 300 million ppl. unless i fucked up somewhere and draws attention, im good. been good for the past couple years, still buying from the dark market, still doing shady shit. still have a bunch of btc thats just sitting and generating profit over time. i been buying btc since 2012. i kno my shit. and when bitcoin hits the high six figure in the future, ill be enjoying with cash, while ull still b payin ur taxes thinking the government gave a shit about u.

@_date: 2019-06-27 20:23:22
i dnt think u understand how bitcoin works. once u tumble bitcoin, its impossible to trace tht coin back to u. there are ways where u then transfer bitcoin into hard cash, tht way ur btc earning never enters ur bank.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:33:23
not confused at all. maybe u need 2 do ur hw before tlkin retarded shit on here. saying im confusing gift card with btc? lol wtf???????? get lost stupid noob. xD
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:24:32
maybe not in stores yet but definitely in person. i started buying in 2012 and walmart had them back then.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:49:06


yeah... thts if u do it legally. u ever thought about the dark market? u ever wonder how tht ppl on dark maret makes hundred and thousands of money in btc a year nd transfer btc into hard cash? government cant trace the btc once its tumbled, then when u sell it for cash, u tell me how the fuck government can trace cash??????
read this:

@_date: 2019-06-27 02:27:14
this is exactly why noobs go broke. msake sure u do some homework and kno wat u are doing before putting ur hard earn money into crypto and then become homeless.
rule of thumb, only buy bitcoin with the money u can afford to lose. tht way u will not regret anything. matter of face, u will learn something through the process. cheers!
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:33:04
most ppl store money in btc to avoid tax. its been done for years now. and it works.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:27:51
do the math bro. lets suppose he brought btc around 11k. 100 dollar at 11k btc is 0.009, suppose btc goes up to, the "so called" million dollar price. thats $9,090 bucks in who knows how long btc will go to a mill. maybe 5 yr, maybe 10 yr. it definitely wont be anything less than 5 yrs. maybe 9k is good for him, u gotta put the time its gonna take him to make that 9k into consideration. by the time btc hits 1 mill, he'll be happy and jumping at his 9k, while ill be profiting into the millions.
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:26:27
he need the money for a hooker to celebrate.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:39:22
coinbase and gdax are the same thing. this is how it works (at least for me) i deposit money into coinbase from my bank. it takes about 6-13 days or even more depending on how much you deposit in order for u to use that money. then i transfer my money into gdax and buy bitcoins. buying and selling from gdax is very low fee. 50 cents to a few dollars depending on the amount u buy/sell. also u can set your own limit price for buying and selling (even lower fee)
u can buy bitcoin straight from coinbase with your bank account, but u will still have to wait a few days to transfer or sell the bitcoin. this is all for security reasons. the good thing of buying bitcoin instead of depot cash first is when bitcoin goes up, your bitcoin that is in hold goes along with whatever price the market is current at.
however for an example with random numbers: if u deposit 1000 bucks into coinbase on monday and u cant use that money till friday. well on monday let say u can buy 1 btc with 1000 dollars but if btc price go up then u can only buy let say 0.7 btc. so during the time u are waiting for ur money to clear, u missed out 0.3 btc. u get what im saying?
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:05:47
supply and demand. more ppl buy. price rise. more ppl sell, price drop.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:14:06
u cant transfer bitcoin from robinhood. next time use gdax from coinbase to buy/sell bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:20:39
keep being a good sheep and pay ur hard earned cash into the government blindlessly. keep doin tht. its sheeps like u tht do watever the government ask u to do and making this corrupt government system rising. go ahead pay all ur hard earned money in tax think government is actually using ur tax money to do goods. stupid noob.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:23:53

if u wanna pay tax, u do u. dont come here nd tell me wtf i need to do wit my money. its my money nd i choose not to pay a fuckin dime to this fucked up government. go bitch to amazon, they made 10 billion dollars and didnt pay no tax.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:24:48
good job noob. since u cant make a counter-argument back, all u can say is retard, lmfao. stay broke dumbass noob. =P
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:23:31
i use btc to buy weed. been doing it since 2012!
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:06:27
hopefully haha. fingers crossed!
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:42:16
did i told him to put money in his bank? where the fuck did i ever say put money in ur bank lmfaoo?????
im simply sayin usin 100 bucks tryna invest in btc is not worth ur time and energy. period. whether u like it or not, the numbers dnt lie and its pure facts if u look by numbers.
NOW, if he were to put 100 bucks every week little by little and over time it adds up, then thats a diff story. but OP doesnt seems like he is doin tht.
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:12:17
lol triggered much? everything i said was true. u know it. =P
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:32:16
im not trolling u wtf? amirite for saying u need a higher fee to get a faster confirmation? im telling u the facts nd u callin me trolling? and u callin me stupid? when u r the one that doesnt kno shit about bitcoin. u so funny man lol. but still a noob tho haha =P
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:22:17
it might went down by the day. but i have been holding a certain amount of btc and havent even touch them since 2012. in the long term btc is on the rise. its still a bull market overall. and even if it drops, i highly HIGHLY doubt it will drop down to 10 dollar a piece(the price where i brought my bitcoins at in 2012)
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:10:28
even if the government were to tax on bitcoin it will be very difficult for them to track personal bitcoin. bitcoin is known for its high anonymity. especially if u tumble ur bitcoin and store them in your private wallet. once u tumble ur bitcoin its near impossible to trace the bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:47:04
lol, bitcoin atm is a ripoff. the fees are stupidly high. and they mark the btc price way too high. if btc is at 12k rn, the atm is charging btc at 20k maybe.
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:39:10
yawn, stay poor noob! =P
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:44:26
u use to be able to buy bitcoin in stores, walmart, cvs, walgreen, or in person.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:04:11
my weed cost more than 100 dollars in btc... i got bad news for ya, u not gonna profit much with 100 dollars. ure looking at pennies and dimes in return.
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:28:37
and if u are not dumb then u will not be transferring millions of dollars u made from btc to ur bank acct. u transfer what u need and spend it almost right away. u also wnt be having only 1 bank acct. u can transfer btc into international money and store the money overseas. how u think the rich get away with taxes? if theres a will, theres a way.
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:38:38
number 1, idk, but from how u were respondin, it seems like u dnt kno shit bout bitcoin.
number 2, u obvi dnt. cuz u dnt even kno watch tumbling and mixer is. nd u dnt kno ppl use bitcoin to avoid taxes. u also dnt kno about the anonymity of bitcoin.
number 3, hey u pay ur tax with ur money. idc. but dnt bitch at me tellin me im wrong for not payin taxes with my money. its my money, i do watever i want with it. but yeah we need dumbass like u who pay taxes like sheeps so i can enjoy my medicaid and go to doctor visits ;)
those are facts. keep em comin hehe xD
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:16:30
because u dnt know when its going to fall. just like yesterday, bitcoin drop to 10k. and a lot of ppl brought bitcoin at 11-13k. so thts a lost of 1-2k. but in the long run, btc is rising. many ppl arent experienced enough and they sell it when bitcoin crash. the key is to keep holding it for 5-10 years, thts the only way u can profit big on btc.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:02:53
in 2009 u can buy 100 btc for a dollar.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:21:17
i dnt trade on robinhood. so idk if u sell it, do u have to deposit the money back to ur bank then deposit back to coinbase, or if u can directly transfer money from robinhood to coinbase(i doubt it). either way, leave whatever u have in robinhood let it grow. but starting now use gdax to trade and sell. gdax is great for bitcoin bcuz its primary focus is crypto currency and no other stocks are mixed into it (unlike robinhood)
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:56:49
dont throw ur 1 and only btc away!!!!!! wait for it to hit 1 mill. and then u'll be a millionaire in a day. =DDDD

@_date: 2019-06-27 21:36:37
not trolling lol, just gavin u my experience wit bitcoin nd when u tryna counter me, i counter back with proof. now counter me again? oh shit, u cant. stupid noob. wheres ur poof tht bitcoin wasnt sold at retail stores back in 2012? were u suckin ur moms tits at that time? hehe xD
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:34:48
lol, and do u kno me? dnt assume stuff like u kno me lil bitch lol. its okay u can believe tht if tht makes u sleep at night. ;)
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:01:43
i brought it when btc was 10 dollar a piece in 2012. so i will never be losing money ;)
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:34:58
yes but the big picture we r looking at here. what is 250% return gonna look like if someone has 100k worth of btc already? think about it. all im saying is with 100 dollars u will not be seeing ANY big amount of return. btc market is not like other stock markets. which other stock market do u see it go from 3k a share to 13k a share in 3-4 months?????
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:18:52
thts a 250 dollar return in 4 months..... if u ask me its penny price in terms of btc return. the only realistic profit is if btc goes up to six figures and depending on the price btc he brought it with 100 bucks. hes looking at a few thousand bucks. idk his objective with btc is. but if u ask me, a few thousand dollar after 3,4 years its mehh. i really wish ppl do their hw and kno how btc works before dumpin money into this market. 
and btw, no one on this earth, not even snoop dogg can smoke a fucking pound of mary a day. lmfao, smh
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:14:19
this is not my main acct. and wat does reddit acct have anything to do with bitcoin knowledge? go do ur hw noob. bitcoin is highly anonymous and once u tumble bitcoin, its near impossible to trace. i doubt u even kno wat tumbling is, stupid noob lol.
u think id use my main acct to tlk bout bitcoin, something i use to buy shit on the dark market? fuck no. gtfo here.
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:03:40
when u go to buy/sell tab on coinbase. on the left it lets u choose ur deposit/payment option. on the right it shows the amount of btc u are buying. then under that u should see the amount of btc u are actually buying after fees, coinbase fee, and total money spent. the numbers will show up once u enter an amount of usd u are willing to buy(on the left-hand side)
if u are depositing cash str8 up from ur bank, NO FEES!
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:39:46
if u anything about btc, u wud kno tht it is known for its anonymity and what btc mixer/tumbling is. and why ppl use btc in the first place. ;D
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:54:48
when the atm first came out i used it once and put 100 dollars in and only got 70 dollar worth of btc i think, maybe even lower. after that one time, i learned my lesson. it was an expansive lesson none the less lol.

and defending myself is insecure??? what????? i think u r the insecure one tht know u were wrong and i exploit ur ignorance now u tryna accuse me for trolling. u r so funny bro, accept the fact u got put in ur place. and watch u gonna reply again, even tho u said u gonna ignore me. u been tryna ignore me a long time ago but u just cant, cuz u r just tht much of a bitch ahahhahhahahaha =P

@_date: 2019-06-27 21:09:49
what was ur fee set at? 50sat/byte is not that much at all. make sure u always max out or at least pay 90% of max fee when doing a transaction. especially where theres high amount of unconfirmed btc. rn according to blockchain there are nearly 80k unconfirmed btc. so u might have to wait for a while to get a confirmation.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:10:31

@_date: 2019-06-27 01:47:11
if u are trading bitcoin on a daily basis u are in the wrong market. bitcoin is better off for investing long term. think of 5-10 maybe 20 years from now. thats when u can expect to make a profit. bitcoin can be at 13k today and go down to 3k tmrw. wat are u gonna do? commit suicide? plz know wat u are doing before putting ur life saving into bitcoin. ppl have gone broke becuz of bitcoin all bcuz they are noobs and when they see the price going up, they pour all their money into it. might as well just go to a casino and go all in at a poker table, u might have a higher chance of winning something tht way.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:04:29
i think in the long term investment u'll still be profiting with bitcoin. at least i am. just depends on how much u originally brought bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:31:07
yeah u hav bitcoin u brought a day ago with zero to no knowledge on how bitcoin even works.
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:37:41
bcuz i smh at the ppl tht suddenly starts buying bitcoin with zero to no knowledge. then when bitcoin crash, they cry and whine about how much money they lose. if u dnt even kno why a confirmation takes so long and wat fees are then u might wanna learn about how crpto actually works before u put ur money into something u barely know anything about and how it works.
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:44:59
ya im real. u sound like a retard tht dnt kno shit bout bitcoin and surprised when i said bitcoin is known for its high anonymity. why do u think btc is used to make purchase on the dark web for years? why u think crypto is the main currency for doing illegal transactions? wake the fuck up dumbass.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:49:22
thts why u pay the max transfer fee. also check on here:  [

ill sell u bitcoin for free. tell me ur wallet address.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:23:08
the best time to buy bitcoin was in 2012 when they were selling 10 dollars a coin. sorry u have missed the opportunity. i was buying bitcoin back then but it wasnt to make money, it was to buy weed from the dark market. and i still have a good amount of coins i am holding onto for all these years. right now bitcoin is at 12k, if u have 12k to spare then sure why not. but if the market starts going down u are losing way more money than i am since i only spend a couple hundred to buy a bunch of bitcoin back in the old days.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:08:03
pshhhhhhhhhhhhhhh lmao, U WISH! 
hint: go sell stuff on darknet if u wanna make some cash in btc. if u're just buyin btc str8 up with ur own hard earned money, thts just sad. never use ur own money to invest btc. use other ppl money to invest for urself, tht way when u lose the money, u wnt cry about it because its not ur money ;D

yup! or u can buy it with a debt or credit card. it will gave in instant access to btc. but only buy max 500 dollars because after 500 dollars the fees are just stupidly high. not worth it. =)
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:53:22
lol sure, highly doubt someone thts been buying through dwolla have zero idea on tumbling and bitcoin tracing. im not saying i dnt pay tax at all, i pay tax, the minimum amount i can possibly pay. tht way on paper, i am paying taxes, ;) wink wink. but in reality, i have way more money tht i actually pay. government wnt gave a shit about the money i have to compare to the corporation tax frauds. and hey, i never buy anything extravagant, theres no high spending on paper, u tell me wat is the reason government wud put me as their target to go after tax lmfao. stupid retard, u think the government is god? tht has a eye on everyone? lmfao, soooooo stupid smh. why r u even in this bitcoin business? shameful! ughhhhhh smh =P

why? im giving him advice because in all honesty, he really cant profit anything from btc with 100 dollars. and u cant disagree with tht fact.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:18:06
yeah but tht doesnt mean IRS will track u down and go after u for using bitcoin to avoid taxes IF u kno wat ure doin. i been using bitcoin to avoid high taxes for yrs and had no problem with the IRS. sure if u suddenly deposit 300k+ into ur bank u will cause some kinda alert, but who the fuck is stupid enough to deposit large sum of money all at once to the bank from btc???
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:59:56
good! keep doing wat u do. paying ur hard earn money to the government. then they can use it to feed those welfare lazy fucks. its ppl like u tht keeps the corrupt government in their place. if paying tax is such a noble thing, then why sooooo sooooo many actually wealthy people avoid it so much? amazon paid 0 tax but made 10 billion dollars. shudnt these big corporations also contribute to society just as much as the civilians? the american tax system is so fucked up, and yet ppl like u still blindlessly pouring ur money into it.

u need a coinbase acct. then u find out wat your receiving address is on coinbase. send btc from gemini to your receiving address. the lower the fee the longer it takes. the higher the faster. 111-122 sat/byte shud be a good range for transactions. once u have btc to coinbase, send it to gdax.(coinbase crypto trading market) trade your btc on there for minimum fees.
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:29:47
as long as btc is going to be around and its not going away anytime soon. when the time comes and btc about to go away, i sell all my btc. make a big big profit and travel the world and retire.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:11:43
no thnx. if u wanna sell me stuff for btc, open up a shop on the dark market, get some reputations and have some dope stuff then i might consider buyin from u =P
