Wtf? I've held BTC longer than you. Your rambling counterpoint is worth less than you think.
Consider yourself warned.  Get out now. It ain't going to 6k.  The run up happened.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:33:58
 I am not yelling.   There is a lot of discussion on the bullish side here that is delusional and fallacious. That's stuff doesn't get down voted or buried because of the vested interest of the typical member of this sub Reddit

Why is my price prediction empty? I gave a detailed plan including entry prices, stops and targets.  (Since deleted, this isn't the right venue anyway)
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:18:56
Huh? That's what I posted. I'm not disagreeing with you. Do you want me to repost it? Sell 4500, 5000, 5500. Stop out above that (56 57 58).  First target below 2000.  I edited it a few times to clarify.
Average risk is 700 per coin.  Not for faint of heart or shallow pockets.  Needs big funds to execute.
Target below 2k gives a reward of more than 2500.  If all three entries are hit (45, 50, 55), reward is over 3000.
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:33:55
Bro i could give you an updated Strategy that is similar:
Sell 4500, then 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55.  Stop out at 56, 57, etc
Not hiding anything.  Contrarily I'm giving insight into big money strategy.  Whole numbers my man.
Again cover below 2000.
If it rallies to 6k I'm wrong and managed risk.  If it falls to 2000 I'm right, still managed risk and made $.
Yes, for now, USA keyboards have dollar signs as a primary symbol.  Maybe you're all right and it's going to a million bucks a coin. But I believe it'll fall from here instead and go down for years.  It's just a bet, I'm not emotional either way.

It's not consolidating friend.  It's sitting at the top of a huge run up.
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:21:30
Joe public? Joe doesn't have enough money to buy even one BTC at 4600, or even 2000.
Joe public is concerned with making ends meet, not speculating on an irrational bubble.

Ho braddah, Good one.  Thanks for reminding me to get back to  tinkering with K8S 
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:52:22
It's a throwaway.  I've been on Reddit since 2007 and BTC since 2010.  
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:39:40
Can you post a chart detailing the area of consolidation on your chosen timeframe?
@_date: 2017-09-07 08:02:38
Why do you think it's likely it'll be higher and not lower? Has it been consolidating or did it just peak out at 5k?
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:04:12
Those two things aren't related.  Objectively, it's not consolidating.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:48:30
Sure thing.  Bitcoin has been on the radar screen of major governments and financial institutions for a number of years now. They've accumulated majority position. The run-up it is a classic speculative bubble that just had a blow off to 5000.  The whales got in a long time ago.
Big money governs the direction. The price action has become more in line with institutional manipulation this year accordingly.   Even if some so-called whales come on board while the price is dropping, it is the majority insiders selling on the way down that will take precedence. 
As for this idea that bitcoin is going to save Joe six pack, that viewpoint fails to consider that the existing wealthy incumbent parties have already made substantial land grabs in bitcoin. This ensures there will be no subversion of existing economic structures.
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:25:51
No it was a good plan. Dumbass
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:02:05
No, I described the entry prices, the stop loss prices and the target (below 2000).  I didn't say it would go back to 5000 but if it did, sell more.  If it doesn't make it to 5000 then there's one entry at 4500.  Selling again at 5000 would make the average sell 4750. And so on.
The strategy would absolutely include adding to the position if proven right (downtrend forms).  But the scaling in higher prices accounts for short term rally before the big fall.  It's a hands off strategy.  The risk to reward is 1:3 or better.  Target would have been below 2k.
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:41:34
If you say so, stranger.  Consider yourself warned.
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:40:47
No I had cited entries and stop losses, targets were below 2k and then lower.  But I deleted the thread.
@_date: 2017-09-07 08:03:27
No one here is going to tank the price.  No, big money insiders govern such things.
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:24:49
What I mean is: it's not doing any consolidating on any time frame.  You can look up what price action looks like during consolidation; this isn't it unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:43:47
Believe what you want. I've advised you to sell now.  There's no reason to hold after this huge run up.  It's not likely to approach 6k but likely to break 2k.
Sell.  Sell.  SELL.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:13:54
This place is infested with delusional cheerleaders.  Rich folks already own the majority of BTC.  The price has had a huge huge run up; it was worth a fraction of a penny under 10 years ago and now peaked at 5k.  Nothing has ever appreciated so much; biggest bubble percentage wise in history.
The best time to invest is when it's going sideways like when it hovered around 200 a few years ago.  Worst time is at the top; that's emotional investing based on FOMO (fear of missing out).
If you buy now, use money you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:35:50
I'm just saying I've been around the community for a lot longer than you. I've done my due diligence. I'm giving you seasoned advice here. Please sell. For your own good.
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:58:39
Hahahahahahaa! Ha!
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:36:31
Terrible advice, that's not a passive strat. Timing markets isn't reliable for most people.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:19:19
I've been involved in BTC longer than you. You're being given insider advice. Sell now while it's worth around 5k.
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:09:47
One has to fight incumbency to believe in and participate in the phenomenon? Get off the internet and take a walk in nature, friend. Smell the fresh air.
