Most instawallets maintain separate wallets for each user, so the coins you withdraw are linked to the coins you deposit.
Exchanges can't do this since the amount you deposit doesn't always match the amount you withdraw (profits/losses), but exchanges maintain detailed records for other reasons.  And they tend to be more alert for coins from large-scale thefts like the bitcoinica disaster.
What makes SatoshiDice such a great laundry is that they can guarantee there is no chain of transactions linking your clean coins to your dirty coins.  The beauty of randomness.

Apparently you didn't even bother to read the link.  **The secret is never given to the laundry customers.**

Uh, no.  This so-called "transparency" you speak of is simply the fact that the hash of the secrets is posted in advance and the transactions are recorded in the blockchain.  So long as laundry customers aren't given preferential odds none of that changes.

As with any laundry service this can be mitigated by laundering your coins in batches; if the launderer screws you you only lose one batch.

Well put.  However this only works in situations where what you're trying to launder away is the quantity of coin.  If the coins originated from a well-known theft the $10 bet that won the huge payoff will still come from the tainted coins.
So, yes, the simple strategy definitely works, but it doesn't remove taint.  There's still a link between the clean coins and the dirty coins; it's just highly diluted.
