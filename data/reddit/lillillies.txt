Woohoo!! I sent an email asking for this in August and you guys followed through!
I can vouch for this company. I've owned 3 pair. Nothing but good things to say about their product.

Rather than asking how it's not, I'd like you to tell my why you think it is.

I've seen two major reasons for this. The first is transaction fees that are too low, or nonexistent. The second is a "dust" output. That is, an output that is less than 0.0000543

Buy bitcoins, not because they will be worth 100x more in the near future, but because the paper in your pocket will be worth 100x less in the near future.

Promote Bitcoin in the AMA thread. Not for Ron Paul, but for all of the libertarian-leaning users who will be reading.

To any hopefuls: This is *not* an indication that the price will go up, nor down.

Please show the deals.
I'm typing this after having gone to the site and deciding not to give my email. It didn't even hint at what I would get.

I've been waiting for a business to accept in this area. Never been to your deli, but this will make me.

The US banking system is a ponzi scheme.
The thing about ponzi schemes is that they will always collapse given enough time. Now, it's true that we don't know if the US dollar will collapse in 5 years or 50, but it **will** collapse.

bitaddress.org lets you generate multiple paper wallets at a time.
Furthermore, the output it gives you (that you print) is simply HTML. You can copy/paste the addresses directly from the generated output, sending coins to each, then print them all.

This test is terribly frustrating. I stopped halfway through.

Everything would continue normal until a miner who had embraced the change mined a block larger than 1 MB. It's at this point a fork in the blockchain would be created.

There will be a period when less security-minded bitcoin users will have a great loss of wealth, and a huge learning process will develop across the community.

Bitcoin websites are getting traffic. That doesn't mean people are using the currency.
Client downloads provides a better picture of relative growth. (not perfect, but better)

Start a bitcoin business.

Not true. Bitcoin would be still be issued not by a person, but by mathematics.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:19:51
Don't assume that keeping a 1 MB limit is "holding bitcoin back"
There may be other solutions that didn't have the chance to be thought up because capitalism was abandoned for a seemingly "no-brainer"
In fact...don't assume that even wrecking Bitcoin and it crashing to $5 would be a bad thing. The cryptocurrency cat is out of the bag. If Bitcoin goes away it will be because something better has replaced it.
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:05:47
Capitalist, here.
I have no responsibility to the rest of the bitcoin network. Your understanding of what individual savings do to an economy is limited and largely based on society's current conversation, yet you speak about the rich's "responsibility" as though it's a certainty.
Be sure of something before you push it onto other people.
@_date: 2013-08-13 19:02:35
There is no immediate practical reason. Hey, at least I'm honest.
People like your mother will not use Bitcoin before there is a reason. Once there IS a reason, it will be because Bitcoin isn't subject to inflation like the USD is, and the consumers reap the benefits.
Everybody still views money in their local government-backed currency. I say to someone: "Here is 0.25 BTC" and even someone who uses the currency regularly checks the exchange rate to see "How valuable it is" (if they are planning on spending it, that is)
Same with retailers. They say: "Okay, so we're selling this product of ours for $100 USD, and Bitcoin is $105/ea so let's sell it for 0.952 BTC".
Thus... The value of bitcoin will only be apparent to regular consumers when the bitcoin economy breaks away from the government economies. In other words: As soon as the business owner who makes shoes can pay for his supplies, electricity/gas, even wages in Bitcoin, the "discount" for bitcoin items will start becoming very noticable, and the dollar (and other currencies) will be exposed as they continue to lose value year after year.

Amping up the public, accepting money from them, and promising them something of value in return is not how you keep the politics out of software.

Another method is to use the browser-based generator at [bitaddress.org]( which gives the option for BIP 0038 encryption.
You're able to save the HTML file to your computer and run it offline, too.

I agree. But know that the reason each tab isn't its own separate page is so that users can save the HTML file to their computer and run it offline. (all tabs)

This is the only competent explanation for this stunt.

Right, like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:03:41
Fastest way to buy? Probably localbitcoins. Actually a better way would be to ask around and try to find an early investor who now has more than he needs.
The faster and better way to acquire bitcoins, however, would be to start accepting them at your place of business, or starting a side business and accepting them.

I don't speak for others, but when I talk to statists about Bitcoin I don't sell it with libertarian ideals. A lot of the liberals get wet over not going through the banks/corporations, though.

Why are you asking this in @_date: 2013-07-16 14:15:24
There's a method of accepting 0-confirmation transactions with a good amount of security. The method involves connecting to a certain handful of nodes on the bitcoin network and checking their transaction pools for the doublespend.
One day I'd like to try implementing this method.
