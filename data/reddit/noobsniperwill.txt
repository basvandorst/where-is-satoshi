lol bro I am studying Mathematical Finance in one of the top 20 universities in the world. This is how financial investment works, you make fast money from bitcoins, doesn’t mean it is a better investment choice for everyone. You also have to consider their risk aversions. It doesn’t matter where that money come from, you invest for your grandma, you have to consider a more secure investment

are you stupid or what? If you are young you can carry the risk of investing in stocks. At the age of your grandma, she can’t lose her retirement money. She is definitely smarter than you are

There is no point of arguing this. The best investment strategy is based on investors’ risk aversion. So different people have different strategies, there is no best options here. I invest in stock markets, but I won’t disagree with people who likes to invest in bonds. We all know it generates less return, but it is much safer and handy if they have any emergency needs

get your logic out of here
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:14:46
lol why should you pay your 10% interest loans when you can invest and gain 20% back with that money

First congratulations!
Best I do wonder how much you have to make when you decided to retire. You entered when bitcoin is 5K, and assume you sold all at 15K - 16K now you have made 200% return. Did you invest 1 million or 2 million dollars? Even that are not enough for me to think of retirement, well I don’t even think 10-20 million is enough for retirement, I might be greedy as fuck :/

please stop explaining these basic economic concepts to them. You can never wake up a person who is pretending to sleep. Just say good luck to them and their “investment”

bank doesn’t make money from owning them. They make money from loans

but it eventually returns to the ground level again
