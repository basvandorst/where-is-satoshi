Interesting. I created an account and could watch the whole video.

 Yes, it is a reupload of his second interview with London Real. You need to login for the full 2+ hour interview.
Edit: Probably not a reupload, but very similar to the one I remember, I think.

So the bot works as a wallet for Reddit? As I do not have any satoshis or a lightning node, what happens when I do this: !lntip 15

11. Schnorr Signatures are a general way of combining multiple EC signatures into one. This is not specific to bitcoin an not implemented yet for bitcoin. 
Lightning does not care about the underlying blockchain. You only need HTLC and multisig capabilities. It is possibile to send bitcoin and the other party receives e.g.  lightcoin or ether. (I don't know if this a reality or just theory)
As far as I understand you can't implement MimbleWimble on top of bitcoin as it is a completely different approach. Hence you need a sidechain as it breaks old transactions and therefore can't be implemented as a hardfork. Long story short I only consider SegWit as a bitcoin specific topic.
 12. A hash is not an encryption. An encryption is reversible, a cryptographic hash like SHA256 is (in practice as far as we know)  not reversible. And you do not encrypt your bitcoin using SHA256. It is used in combination with RIPEMD160 to calculate a bitcoin address from your public key.
