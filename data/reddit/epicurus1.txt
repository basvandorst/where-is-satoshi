From what I understand.  I could open a lightning channel with you and we do thousands of transactions between eachother for just over the price of one transaction fee. Theses channels can be sort of chained together like their own network, so millions of transactions can be done incredibly quickly between loads of people. Not perfect for every situation as you have to fund a channel with the bitcoin you want to spend first.

Finding a block is like everyone scratching loads of lottery cards as fast as possible and the reward goes to the first guy to find a jackpot card first. Your card could find the winner, but chances are, the guys checking millions more a second will win. For example. If you have 1% of the worlds scratching power you will on average win one jackpot every 100 rounds of scratching. Problem is one 1070 is way outnumbered against loads of dedicated machines.

@_date: 2018-04-26 22:16:40
Every 4 years the block reward halves. In the beginning 50 bitcoin were issued every ten mins as a reward for mining. Then 25 and now 12.5 and so on. So as time goes on fewer and fewer coins are issued. As time goes on the longer it takes to issue more coins. Last coins to be mined will be in 2140CE.

The difficulty adjusts to the amount of mining power every two weeks. This is to keep new blocks being found every 10 mins on average.

New person here. I heard a rumor that Satoshi has 1 million btc. I could understand he/she/they probably would (after all in the beginning it would have been worthless). But suppose btc did become a or the dominant currency. Acounting for lost coins that would be about 5%. Say there is 60 trillion floating around the world that's a personal wealth of $3 Trillion.
