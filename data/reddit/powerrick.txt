From what I can see from my data, it was a bit laggy, but always avail.
Note: The Y-axis of the bottom chart needs to be slightly adjusted to smaller values, but you can still recognize a few small peaks.
Anyone experienced a complete downtime?

There have been a few major updates to the site
* automated tweets for online/offline events [twitter.com/bitcoin_status](
* more precise checks for the state
* Server Version checks (e.g. mtgox uses an older nginx ;p)
* Historical views have been updated to 7 days
Announcement about the scientific approach can be viewed at [bitcointalk](

the prices are currently taken from mtgox api

I made another update that now shows charts of up-/downtime of every monitored website.
You can now track how much percent of time a page has been online/offline and compare that to other pages in the same category

So there is a new update to this site for anybody interested.
* 60min charts (updated every 5min)
* 24hrs charts (updated every 5min)
* Online/Offline checks are now done by tripple checking via different methods for better reliability
Also the API for each site and each chart is now publicly available.
The bitcoin price (in USD) is already included in the json API files, but not yet in the charts.
Any wishes or critics are still welcome

Yeah that's true. I had double checked that with my university in terms of acceptance for the project. And as far as I am using my actual own data that won't be a problem. Additionally this project also tries to achieve a different goal. The main purpose is the long-term evaluation of distributed traffic against drastic change in BTC price.
For the layout however, I have to admin, I asked a friend of mine (as I am not capable of doing this myself) to help me create a page template. So this can also change in the future if I have violated anything here :-)
Once I have a reliable amount of long-term data it will also make its way into the API interface and be released under an open source license (as it is a research project). Currently only the live data is available in JSON and XML. Currently I am also working on an even more real-time approach with nodeJs.
If you feel that I should also take into account additional variables from the market please let me know.

Sorry, I didnt' see that before. It's totally OK for, just wanted to make a point here, but seems as it is not needed anyway.

have you ctrl-f-ed the page for 'bitcoin' or have you actually read the article?
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:45:35
Another Update here :-)
* BTC price (low, avg, high) has been included in order to see load/reaction time effects on btc and vice versa.
* Remote checks are now donw 5 times in a row via fsockopen, wget and curl to be even more exact about the online/offline state of each particular site
* Built-in Page refresh
* Also now including most of the btc exchanges
Anyone out there already using the api data?

Nice idea, but I don't see many entries yet.
