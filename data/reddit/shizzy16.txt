True, the internet has the attention span of a lemon, the biggest thing today won't even register to the average person in a year.

It's impossible for it to work out for everyone. Not everyone can make money and a lot of people are gonna lose.

I would say there is no consensus, people who believe in bitcoin seem to think it's not fiat because it is backed by "the blockchain and security" or whatever. Most people who know a lot or think they know a lot about bitcoins like myself believe it is fiat.

That's an incorrect definition of fiat, no one says mooning, and the whole HODL thing doesn't add to the legitimacy of crypto, it makes everyone sound like idiots doing a meme on the internet.

It's not a store of value, or a good one at least. It's a highly speculative asset in which some win but a lot will lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:04:42
Lol  not everyone is making money on this, every time someone comes out ahead someone loses.

Did they freeze their site to try and prevent mass sell off?

That's such a misleading graph at glacé from what you have to ratios to

Kind of hard seeing how it is also a fiat, just digital.

Except bitcoin isn't an essential component in creating computer parts to use gold, it's the other way around.
