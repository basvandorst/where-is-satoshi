since we are talking will, I assume you mean a PIN for a hardware wallet (not SW wallet, be it desktop or mobile). I think you are trying to see the path where you don't have the seed anymore. Since you don't need the seed phrase every time you use the hardware wallet, yes, you can theoretically\* move your bitcoin to another address that belongs to a different wallet where you do have your seed available.
\* very bad practice to rely on this, because even with a HW wallet (SW are much higher risk) might get bricked over time, or require an update to work which might/might not erase the device and game is over.
seed = private key = everything

this changes so often that my last month's experience might not be valid anymore. depends heavily on your area. find a few, try them for lowest amount (ideally same for easy comparison). most often I see relatively high cap in both directions without KYC, which might be worth the fee.
don't trust, wear shades.

99% of r/economics are posts about recession and fiat fuckups. go there and mention bitcoin if being downvoted is your kink, though.
edit: i kind of agree with you, just have more empathy for the complacent ones.

didn't want to suggest using the legacy address tbh. I'd much rather use services that use Segwit. Also remember, legacy to segwit is non-segwit TX, Segwit to legacy is a Segwit TX.
They had more than 2 years, anyone who didn't adopt yet is already irrelevant, as there is much more to come.

yes, my point is that MLM doesn't present itself as MLM to public. bitcoin, kinda does sound like it at first.

interesting consideration. I don't expect it to be analogical to boomers, but I am quite convinced that later generations will not be able to understand how could people 'not get it', like we now laugh at early takes on internet skeptics.

their website validates the address against the rule that bitcoin address must start with "1". Important part is, whether the TX got broadcasted. If they broadcasted your TX and you have the private keys for the address in the output, doesn't matter what coinbase \[or anyone else\] thinks is valid.
If the TX doesn't get broadcasted and is rolled back instead, they are morons, make your BRD wallet generate a legacy address and send it there.

same. plus its electricity cost for 1 year.

you chose your software that implements changes/features you prefer on user level. If you want more you can run a full node and thereby enforce the rules and validate all transactions yourself. 


there is a great number of people that used it as a currency already and bought things, did you find it slow and expensive yourself?


there is a misconception that every bitcoin hodler owns a round number of bitcoin. In reality, it looks like X.872394873. Practical example, let's say you have 0.939212btc you are hodling for years, buying a little every paycheck. Coffee is  0.00033. Relative to your stack, it just doesn't matter. 
some people here prefer to use it a little while accumulating, preferably a fraction of what is put in. If bitcoin price 'moons' so  0.00033btc could buy you a house, what really matters is if you still have the rest of your stash or not.

are we going to ignore the fact that newsletter  discusses disabling BIP70? Coincidence? I think not...  
on a serious note, reading this I had many questions about BIP70 and turns out Andreas already covered this:  [

it however does sound scammier^(TM) than scams. Scam: we just sell beauty/healthcare products. Bitcoin: it's limited and if you buy in, it will go up!
bitcoin dgaf.

thinking abt it now i'll prob DCA the electricity cost over that year.

what a blast from the past. This is what most newcomers don't get, that in 10 years, everything they are concerned about now was discussed on some old ass forum thread.

don't do it then. that will show 'em.
