I see what your problem is. You an impatient asshole, with a woe is me complex. *I'd drag my feet with a prick like you, for sure.

I hope your infinite wisdom gets the irony? Thank you for making my point. :)

I accidentally bought Etherium Classic. I'm still waiting for my refund. Maybe support can escalate?

:) A lot of these post will not age well, and I'm only judging that by the level of arogance on display. Nothing to do with market, or Tech.

How though? You have to have merchants, and you have less now then you had January 1? How exactly do you think that is going to happen?

A billion? You are loosing all of your merchants? This is insane for you to think.

This never works out well for you guys. Congrats on your very short-lived victory. It will do zero to stop Bitcoin Cash.
