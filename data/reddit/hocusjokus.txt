I like what James D'Angelo does in this [short film.]( He finds someone who it could help and then helps them.
Maybe this Ronald guy could turn it into a business where he helps other members of his community get into bitcoins.
I just don't know anyone that does remittances.

Hey man, I've finally recovered my wallet.dat file, my hard drive was completely corrupted and had to go to someone else to recover it.
Anyway, what shall I do next? Should I re-download bitcoin QT and then save the wallet.dat to it?

But merchant adoption wouldn't be so strong if people weren't spending them.
Just allow it to grow naturally. I like the fact that I can still buy bitcoins at a time, soon those days will be gone.

I don't have time to watch it but I would like to know what's the 'buzz around bitcoin atms?'
Can someone give a summation?

Saying his views hasn't evolved admits he has a primitive understanding of economics.
Knowledge evolves and if you don't keep up, it will leave you behind.
I am somewhat dissapointed that Schiff has adopted bitcoin because I wanted him to miss this one and look completely foolish. Instead he will still look foolish but make money from it.
Personally I will never buy gold from his company with my bitcoins or fiat.

Thanks very much for your help.
The main problem I'm having with finding my wallet.dat file is that I'm in troubleshoot mode in my windows boot-up option and the appdata file is hidden by default.
