In the casino here in Cleveland, you simply have to exchange your chips for cash and then pay for drinks if you don't have cash on hand.  Having to leave the table is inconvenient, but otherwise this is an openly acknowledged loophole (if you could even call it that).
With that in mind, what is preventing Coinbase/Bitpay/whoever the establishment is using from simply "buying" your bitcoins at market rate, and then allowing you to immediately spend the USD balance on drinks?
Unfortunately, this precludes the place from accepting and holding BTC directly from customers instead of always immediately converting to USD.  However, they could theoretically purchase BTC immediately after the sale if they wanted to do so.
Edit:  I should add that this is basically what Bitpay/Coinbase/etc already do if the place chooses to receive USD.  The difference is in carefully wording what is happening to navigate a legal minefield.

And a burger is totally worth the risk that someone else might find a block in those few minutes and take the 25BTC reward! Genius!

That leaves you bearing some risk of sending money and the buyer not being there.  Hopefully soon, if you and the buyer can agree on a reputable escrow service, you can lock the coins in a 2-of-3 transaction before driving over. Once that confirms, you can't double-spend the locked-up coin without colluding with the escrow service, and you can still get your money back if the buyer doesn't show up/have the cash.  Finally, if all goes smoothly, you and the buyer can release the bitcoin without even involving the third party.

If the point of sale system takes the proper precautions (mostly just connecting to a lot of nodes, and probably some large well known ones they trust), a place like a coffe shop can get away with accepting transactions after a few seconds.  Once a transaction propagates through enough nodes, it's going to cost someone way more than the price of coffee to pull off a double spend.

If you provide an email address, they will send you an encrypted wallet backup every time the private keys stored within change, so you can import the wallet into another client if the site ever goes down.

Which is exactly what they are trying to do with their provably fair system.  Casino games have large variances by design, and even "professional" card counters go through streaks where they lose tens of thousands of dollars in a run.  I'm certainly not a cryptography expert, but their system is well enough designed that they would need an unrealistic amount of hardware or a VERY clever sidechannel attack to be able to stack the deck.

Not necessarily, if the majority of miners are back on 0.7 then any new forks from "bad" blocks will get quickly out-raced before they can really grow.  As far as patching goes, my guess is that there will be a 0.7 (and possibly older) patch to address the DB configuration issue as well as a 0.8 patch placing an artifical limit on block size.  Once the vast majority of nodes are on the patched 0.7-0.8 versions, the limit on the 0.8 client can be lifted.
