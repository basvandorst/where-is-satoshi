As a temporary spam measure according to satoshi. So that cant be the reason to decide 1/2MB is ok forever.
can you give a clear answer to that question: do you get paid to write this?
reasonable? how is it reasonable when fees were dozen of dollars and transaction times days with less than 1% of people involved? Companies like steam and microsoft stopped accepting bitcoin because of that.
chosen by everyone?  (2013) see like/dislike ratio and comments. Majority against this small blocks. +there is clear evidence that heavy censorship on other platforms led to "most people in favour".
Thats enough already but if on top of that noone can give a good answer to my questions its pretty obvious in my opinion that everyone here talking like you is a shill (or repeating stuff he has no clue about) and BTC-Bitcoin became a huge joke.

No, the goal was not max. decentalization, or the limit would be lower than 1MB already. There was a balance found. Why at 1MB and not X is what im asking. See above for X. I specificly asked for facts why X does not provide sufficient decentralization/security. (If a "minuscule risk" would mean people could possibly use bitcoin properly until LN is fully working, it would have been worth it. Except there are any facts that show that this "minuscle risk" would have lead to insufficient decentralization/security. Thats what im asking for and nothing else!
You did exactly what i critisized as the only answers i got so far. It doesnt answer my question at all.
@_date: 2019-03-24 00:45:22
nope. just claims without any proof.
@_date: 2019-03-27 11:41:19
You obviously dont understand my concerns. But i dont care, since you are not a nice person.
@_date: 2019-03-23 23:03:26
LOL what? Fees were $60 at the ATH. About the same would happen right now again if we had that much usage, because of the blocksize limit! So why no bigger (or maybe heavier, whatever) blocks?
Can you, or anyone, answer my question above, or not?
@_date: 2019-03-27 11:31:16
Wrong. In the beginning there was no block size limit at all. Then satoshi added 1MB as a temporary anti-spam measure. That doesnt justify to keep that number as a constant limit in any way. The problem is the scaling issues were not being handled by LN or anything when TX volume went up in november 2017 and fees were $60. Even now bitcoin/LN couldnt properly handle that much usage. Its not pointless to focus on one number for a start that could be enough for reasonably fast&amp;cheap transactions until LN is properly working...
@_date: 2019-03-25 04:27:49
I said that this is my impression, yes. If you mean by answer that you wrote something, then you did answer, yes. But you didnt actually answer my question.
@_date: 2019-03-27 12:23:29
I dont think so, lol, where did you get this from? Afaik from his point of view 2nd layers/sidechains were only necessary for sub-cent (or maybe sub-dollar) payments.
@_date: 2019-03-27 21:20:02
Yes, because TX volume is low. People stopped using it after fees hit dozens of dollars. Same could happen again with high volume.
@_date: 2019-03-27 08:40:46
Porbably not all but I remember for example samson mow saying that bitcoin is not for people earning less than $2 a day. Or was that before LN? He definitely couldn't say that about how bitcoin was described in the whitepaper by satoshi though.
@_date: 2019-03-24 23:37:44
Please answer i didnt get a real answer in yesterday's daily thread.
@_date: 2019-03-25 04:17:37
 You're not answering my question. How exactly did people conclude that 1/2MB is the (allegedly) optimal size?
@_date: 2019-03-23 03:39:10
There is a difference between slower/less efficient and too slow/not efficient enough.
Bitcoin once was fast&amp;cheap p2p electronic cash (title of the whitepaper). Now the big bankers are saying bitcoin (btc) is not money because its too slow/expensive. And they are fucking right LMFAO. So how can you call other coins, that are what bitcoin was supposed to be (and once was), shitcoins as long as the LN isnt even properly working and maybe never will???
Can you give any proof that bigger blocks (like intended by satoshi) are not secure enough? Why exactly the 1/2MB block size limit?
I asked that question in 2 different daily threads - no answer at all. Isnt that interesting? Feels like everyone like you is a shill/repeating stuff he has no clue about. Lets see if you can answer.
@_date: 2019-03-24 00:20:07
I can only find people saying bigger blocks lead to less decentralization. But where is proof that big enough blocks for reasonable fees lead to insufficient decentralization/security? 2nd layers were only intended by satoshi for sub-cent payments.
Or did the people behind the BTC Bitcoin just create a problem to offer a solution where they can profit off???
@_date: 2019-03-28 00:28:57
Idk if your math shows that this would have been untenable until LN possibly works properly. If it was that easy and obvious, then why did satoshi only add the limit as a temporary anti-spam measure?
Would your math maybe look very different if you took this into account? :) 
Edit: If not, i will look into it. Its definitely the only actual answer i got so far. So thx for that, if it turns out to make sense.
@_date: 2019-03-27 09:34:49
Hey i didnt make that argument, i just said its that way according to them and gave you one example :D
@_date: 2019-03-27 05:22:01
I cant count that as an answer because i was asking about big blocks without segwit (and i have no idea how segwit affects bandwith requirements). A 10MB block size limit without segwit does not have the potential to kick a major amount of nodes off the network [in a few month], does it?
@_date: 2019-03-24 06:22:25
i want to see the exact reasons/numbers or whatever why 1/2MB was chosen as the limit. and why a reasonable limit that would not have reversed adoption because of high fees (microsoft/steam etc. stopped accepting it) was suddenly considered as not secure enough.
@_date: 2019-03-27 10:54:42


Idk, but it seems 100% feasible to me for the next 18 month. Until LN is ready. HAHAHAHA. No, seriously. Thats specifically what i was asking. Why didnt this happen, so everyone could have kept using/accepting it until then with fees below a buck or so. No big bankers beeing able to say bitcoin is not money because its too slow/expensive etc. Would have been quiet nice. Actually it would have been mandatory imo. At least if noone can show that this would have led to insufficient decentralization/security. So?
@_date: 2019-03-27 10:32:06
You said the same thing again, wtf! Not talking to you anymore.
And obviously you cant call trying to get low enough fees to keep bitcoin useable for enough people (until the LN works properly, which it might never do) an unnecessary risk.
Nope again. Originally the block size limit was just a temporary anti-spam measure according to satoshi. Big blockers are the ones who wanted to keep it the same :)
@_date: 2019-03-24 00:34:12
I cant believe you actually think that. There can be (and obviously are) other reasons why bitcoin cash has that much less computing power behind it and lost more value. You didnt show proof that big enough blocks for reasonable fees are not secure enough. When that decision was made there wasnt even bitcoin cash to take a look at LOL. So why exactly was the blocksize limit kept at 1/2MB. Maybe just to create a problem to offer a solution to profit off of?
@_date: 2019-03-25 18:15:47
Idk, everyone that is responsible for this limit. What do you mean? That is pretty much what i am asking. Where to find an explanation how people came up with the 1/2MB. According to satoshi it should have just been a temporary spam measure at 1MB. More is considered not secure enough now, why exactly? There have to be clear reasons if they put everything more or less on a halt for years now (and a 2nd layer solution is still not working properly)?
@_date: 2019-03-24 22:53:40
What??? I was asking if they kept the blocksize limit that low, not because it would be insecure otherwise, but to get fees high and transactions slow. And therefore move people to sidechains etc. which they can profit of.
I have no idea how what you said is supposed to answer anything i wanted to know. 2nd layers actually take profit away from miners, so WTF???
@_date: 2019-03-24 23:27:41
High fees little times can be less than low fees many times. Can be the other way too, idk, but it doesnt answer my questions.
@_date: 2019-03-23 22:49:34
Didnt you realize that this doesnt answer my question at all? Everything you said does not mean that the same would have happened with bitcoin (btc), if the 1/2MB limit was removed like intended by satoshi.
@_date: 2019-03-23 23:14:03
Hey, why does this get downvoted but noone can answer my questions?
@_date: 2019-03-25 18:26:24
And are there any particular reasons that make you feel like 1MB might be too large to be safe? And dont tell me again "because it can be more decentralized with a smaller limit". I know that. But my question is what facts/numbers show that 1MB or higher is not secure enough. (Max security cant be the goal, because then it would be lower already. So a balance was found. But why exactly there?)
Now show me if you have any understanding of what youre saying or if youre just repeating claims you cant back up by anything. Anyone can answer. Thx.
@_date: 2019-03-27 10:43:29
I wasnt even talking about huge blocks (also in reply to your first answer). Just enough to possibly keep fees below a buck until the LN works properly. Like 10MB? Im only asking for facts that show that this could already lead to insufficient decentralization/security. I clearly said that im not interested in anything else...
@_date: 2019-03-25 04:06:37
You're not answering my question. How exactly did people conclude that 1/2MB is the (allegedly) optimal size?
@_date: 2019-03-27 21:30:16
 Im talking about an increasing of the block size limit to XMB. See original comment for X.
@_date: 2019-03-27 07:02:01
So some years ago bitcoin was hyped as currency+payment system in one. Now its only hope to become wide spread cash is the LN as the payment system and until sth like this works properly (which might never be the case) its not a great currency because of high fees if a lot of people want to use it.
Then it got much love for beeing able to bank the unbanked. Now its not for the poorest people in the world anymore (even with a properly working LN), according to people behind BTC/LN.
And a majority here seems to be okay with that, even though noone can give me a proper answer on why exactly a reasonable block size limit (that might not have reversed adoption because of high fees/long transaction times) was suddenly considered as not secure enough? WTF? Is this for real? (1MB was only supposed to be a temporary anti-spam measure according to satoshi.)
Check my post history. I asked this multiple times. In daily threads and in comment sections. I just got claims that bigger blocks lead to less decentralization, but what im asking for is facts that back up the claims, that a reasonable block size limit would not provide sufficient decentralization/security. And anyone downvoting me or praising the LN should, without a doubt, be able to provide these! It doesnt make any sense if not!
Maybe i have to add what i mean by reasonable. Im not an expert, so i cant really say a number. What would have likely kept fees low for a good amount of time (maybe until LN is possibly properly working) during the last bull run? 10MB? What facts show that 10MB (or whatever number makes more sense here) does not provide sufficient decentralization/security?
Another thing to add. Miners chose the 1MB by majority, right? If that happened because they wanted the best for Bitcoin, then there should be clear facts to answer my question with, no? I've heard that this happened because over 2/3 of miners were in china and bigger blocks would have been problematic because of their great firewall. Is that true? There could potentially be other reasons for that consensus too, apart from most miners wanting the best for bitcoin, right?
This time im posting very early in the daily thread, so everyone can see. Go ahead guys! Thanks!
P.S.: Please dont downvote again if you cant answer! And if noone provides facts again, you should probably question your views instead! How pathetic is it that my posts (just stating facts and asking questions) get downvoted, yet noone provided an appropriate answer (claims backed by facts) so far? Doesnt seem legit to me at all.
@_date: 2019-02-26 20:48:03
Care to explain why? The revolutionary concept was p2p e-cash for everyone now its digital gold too expensive to use for everyday transactions (when transaction volume gets high). Allegedly even with LN (channel opening and closing fees) too expensive for very poor people. Right or wrong? It was praised as currency+payment system in one, now it cant properly serve as money without the LN. So what are you talking about?
Werent second layers/side chains only necessary for sub cent payments according to satoshi? What changed?
@_date: 2019-02-26 19:48:03
Hey guys, i have some Questions regarding block size limit/LN
1. Is  it true that the block size limit was only intended as a temporary  security measure? And that according to satoshi everything was supposed  to securely and cheaply work on-chain for every person on the planet  (apart from micropayments in the sub cent range)? Then why exactly is  the block size limit what it is right now?
2. If  a few billion people would start using exclusively bitcoin as their  money within the next few years, how much would an average person be  spending on LN fees (including opening and closing channels obviously)?  Just asking for a very rough estimate if thats somehow possible.
3. And  in that case, about how many LN channel opening and closing TXs would  the blockchain have to handle? (7 per second are possible with the  current block size limit and this is not going to change, right?)
4. And  is it true that the poorest people on earth wont be able to afford this  anymore? Wasnt that one of the most valued aspects of bitcoin before  (morally)? (I know that they can right now because fees are low, but  thats not the case anymore when TX volume goes up like in december  2017.)
5. Is  the LN \*significantly\* more decentalized/secure than the forks with big blocks? If not  and it gets attacked/taken down, could the block size limit instantly be  increased, so that everyone can keep paying his stuff on-chain without  drowning in fees? And how can people be sure that this would happen in  that case?
@_date: 2019-02-26 22:28:59
Ofc but this WHILE it serves as p2p e-cash, which it isnt able to do for billions of people since it was decided that the blocksize limit was beeing kept at 1/2MB and that 2nd layers/side chains are necessary for everyday transactions. This put bitcoin pretty much on a halt for years now and the LN is still not working! What are the exact facts that lead to that change?
Seems odd that you make fun of forks with big blocks in that situation. Which seem to function properly. If centralization/insecurity is an actual issue there, why havent they already been attacked/taken down? (the earlier, the easier, right?) And im sure there are a lot of powerful people/organizations behind BTC that would have loved to make at least one example. Why did noone?
@_date: 2019-02-26 23:53:49
My understanding is that big blocks can benefit billions of people right now (if there are no security issues), which LN still cant properly. Im trying to find out if there actually are security issues. If you are against big blocks you should be able to answer my questions. Thx!
@_date: 2019-02-27 17:01:25
The outrage the keeping of the block size limit induced 5-6 years ago...it seems like there was/is no evidence that big enough blocks for billions of daily on-chain TXs lead to insufficient decentrality/security, is there?
[ (in the comments)
The low block size limit was introduced by satoshi as a temporary(!!) security mechanism, and according to him bitcoin could securely work fast and cheap for everyone and everything apart from micro-payments (way less than a coffee), right? Which facts indicated that he was wrong? There has to be rather strong evidence if people put bitcoin on a halt for an unknown amount of time until a 2nd layer solution is functioning, right? (now years and still not properly working).
And if the bitcoin forks with big blocks actually had those issues, why has noone attacked them/taken them down? Im sure there are a lot of powerful people/organizations behind BTC that would have loved to make at least one example. Why did noone?
@_date: 2019-02-27 17:02:54

Which Bitcoin is the closest to what satoshi desribed in the whitepaper?

If you said Bitcoin instead of BTC I'd add fast an cheap transactions.

You mean BTC the now so-called "digital gold"? That one doesn't even match the title of the whitepaper anymore. How did you come up with that?
