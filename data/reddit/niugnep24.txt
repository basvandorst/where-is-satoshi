The reason bitcoin has high fees is because of too many transactions trying to squeeze into limited blockchain room. See this presentation for a good illustration 
Bitcoin can't scale to billions of transactions a day without gigabyte blocksize. Can any altcoin scale that much? If not, how many altcoins do we need to get to a billion transactions a day? Will vendors accept them all?
Saying you can switch to altcoins to avoid huge fees is kicking the can down the road. The reason the altcoins have small fees *currently* is because they aren't handling many transactions. If you started to divert transactions to them, their fees would skyrocket, too.

Instead of each person having individual channels open with each seller, think of something like a "bitcoin paypal" where you have a channel open with the middle man, and they in turn open a channel with each seller, that they aggregate all transactions through. I think the LN is set up so "middle man" scenarios like this are viable -- ie, they won't be able to steal your coins.

Monetary base is not money supply. Inflation is tied to the latter, not the former.
The monetary base is multiplied up to create money supply by banks loaning. Banks loan less and keep more in reserve, the money supply contracts, the fed does QE to compensate.

QR codes are a bit cumbersome, but I don't understand why you brush off NFC so quickly. It's *already* being used for POS transactions. And I for one don't mind if my payment system only works within a few centimeters rather than 50m, and that I have to make a physical motion to confirm it.
EDIT: and this part is *completely* incompatible with bitcoin:


This means that the checkout counter would have to have access to *your private bitcoin key*. That's horrifying. It breaks everything bitcoin is about. Paypal "gets away" with it in their beacon system because there's an assumption that the shopkeeper is trustworthy, and worst case you can charge back invalid transactions. Plus once you leave the store they (presumably) can't make any more transactions on your behalf. That won't fly in the bitcoin world. Once they have your private key your address is theirs.
Or even if you rigged up some method by which your private key isn't transferred, but you allowed some external bluetooth device to send funds out of your wallet autonomously -- who in their right mind would do that?
There is no way to securely process a bitcoin transaction without the consumer explicitly activating their wallet app to do so.

@_date: 2014-12-28 20:46:41
Fiat currencies are de facto backed by their economies. If you have a system where a certain currency is used to denote almost all prices and wages, then the value of that currency self-adjusts to the size of that economic system.
The issue with Bitcoin as a "currency" to me is that there's no semi-closed economic system that's associated with it. So the value of bitcoin is completely determined by investors/speculators, at least at the moment.

Banks won't disappear under a Bitcoin economy.
Ask yourself: will anybody ever need a loan in a bitcoin economy?
Unless that answer is 100% no, then banks will still exist to accumulate capital and make money off of interest rate arbitrage. Remember, a bank account is nothing but a loan to a bank. 
And any complex modern economy runs mostly on credit. Businesses borrow against future earnings. The effective money supply is multiplied based on the credit markets and the reserve rate. A Bitcoin economy would operate exactly the same way, except with no central control over banking rules. Zero reserve banking would not be illegal.

What's the difference between "exploiting a vulnerability in the work function" and a "finding a clever way to optimize your work-function algorithm"? Serious question, because it's not clear to me.
The BIP talks as if a 30% optimization will be the end of bitcoin as we know it. But then what about when miners started using GPUs? Or FPGAs? Or ASICs? Those were much larger quantum leaps in mining efficiency compared to this.
The BIP talks as if this optimization "blocks" protocol upgrades. How so? Isn't it the other way around -- some protocol upgrades will render the operation useless. Such is the risk when you try to be too "clever" with such things. And in fact that's essentially what this BIP is proposing as a "fix"! 
So why is the "fix" necessary now at all, other than to specifically target and disable a particular group's competitive advantage? Imagine if when mining ASICs came out, the bitcoin developers decided to completely replace the work function with an asic-resistant one such as scrypt, to neutralize miners who were "exploiting" how easy it was to mine bitcoin efficiently on an ASIC. Would that have been a good idea?
The language choice in this email from "covert attack" to "blocks improvements" is very loaded and frankly disingenuous.

What? The work is still done. A valid hash is still found. A way to find that hash that does less work is *by definition* a more efficient algorithm to implement the POW. Doing less work to get the same result is what an optimization *is*!


This is nonsense. A protocol change breaking an optimization does not mean that the optimization is "blocking" that change. What loaded language. 
Hell, the proposed fix will break the optimization. Does that mean that the proposed fix is being "blocked"? So it has to be fixed so as to unblock itself? It's absurd circular logic.

Well yes and no. The fed can create money by buying government debt. But it's still real debt that requires interest payments (ie it's not "free money"), and the government can't force the fed to buy it (if inflation's getting high, most likely the fed will try to contract the money supply).
The supply of bitcoin instead is determined by the developers. Right now it's destined to taper off, but there's nothing theoretically speaking stopping them from issuing a new update that creates new bitcoin forever. Lots of people would probably reject it, resulting in  a blockchain fork and havok that would crash the bitcoin economy, so they won't do it, but the same argument can be made as to why the fed won't do something silly with the US money supply.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:48:01
It's true bitcoin is backed by its usefulness as a money. The technology is sound (it's liquid and secure), so really this comes down to how many people use it (network effect).
However, no one really knows what this value *is* right now, and anyone trading on it is doing so speculatively. It could be worth a lot more or a lot less than what it's priced at right now, and also this value could change over time as more people adopt bitcoin or decide to drop it for an alternative.

It depends on if they've hit their daily sell limit.

You're implying that the only problem with deflation is hitting a subdivision limit and therefore the solution is more subdivision. I'm not talking about hitting a subdivision limit, I'm talking about going into a deflationary spiral.




But in this case you'll always be dependent upon fiat currencies to provide the basis for your bitcoin value. Right now bitcoin only has value because people are willing to trade fiat for it. In order to create a self-contained bitcoin economy, where the value of bitcoin is based on its economic activity, and you never have to touch fiat, bitcoin will have to be much less volatile. Guaranteed uncontrolled deflation threatens that.


First off, debt can still exist in a bitcoin economy. I could borrow or lend bitcoin just as easily as fiat. And there's always a demand for debt, because people always find reasons to value money now more than money later. This is a pretty fundamental part of basically every economic theory, even austrian.
Debt also fills an important economic role. It is not "inefficient." Try starting a business without taking out a loan. If you see an opportunity to generate wealth, but don't have the capital for it yet, it *absolutely* makes economic sense for you to take out a loan and use someone else's idle money to do something valueable, both for you and for the economy as a whole.


You're getting your terms confused. Increasing buying power is the *opposite* of "inflating the money supply."


Absolutely wrong. Savings and checking accounts are absolutely the primary source for monetary capital for banks, which they then loan out for income. That's **how banks work**.
Putting money in a bank has a *completely different economic impact* than storing it in a safe or under the bed. If you can't understand this then i'm not sure this conversation is going to continue much longer.


Again, again *again again* **again AGAIN AGAIN** this isn't about the absolute prices! It's the direction prices are *moving*! Can you tell I'm getting frustrated?


You may have noticed we're coming off of a *recession*. Recessions usually involve some deflationary risk. The hoarding by financial institutions is certainly a problem and as a result central banks are pumping huge amounts of money supply into the system to try to counteract it. 
Have you tried getting a loan in the last few years? Notice how hard it was? That's just scraping the surface of the tip of the iceberg of the impact deflation can have on an economy.


Are you joking? Look at the post wwii boom on [this chart]( And inflation has been positive basically since the great depression. Yeah since the 70's we've had a wage stagnation problem, but you really need to stop saying things like "never."


You borrow in inflationary currency because you want to spend it on stuff before it loses value. You save/loan in deflationary because you don't want to spend it yet, because it will increase in value. Lots of people not wanting to spend is *bad for the economy*.

I feel I need to back up and re-iterate context, here.
- This thread is about bitcoin breaking $100/BTC
- posted that BTC exchange rate is a hockey stick, and "must crash."
- you posted an article showing how technological improvements can grow exponentially, without crashing
- I stated that there's a difference between technological improvements and commodity trading prices
And now you're here trying to argue that bitcoin technology has a lot of potential for exponential value (something I don't necessarily disagree with) and that we shouldn't be looking at its price on commodities markets as a measure of its value (again something I don't necessarily disagree with).
**But this entire discussion started with you justifying an exponential rise in the BTC commodity market with a connection to exponential increases in technological ability**
So I'm really at a loss of what we're talking about here, and exactly what you're trying to argue. Should $/BTC be treated as a commodity market (and worry about a crash) or as some inherent measure of BTC technology's potential (and not worry about a crash)? Because you seem to have argued both points at different times so far.

You're confusing bitcoin the technology with bitcoin the emulated currency.
Bitcoin the technology is amazing, efficient, innovative, groundbreaking, etc. But it's also free and open source. No one is selling underlying bitcoin technology, though it does open up new markets to make money in -- bitcoin exchanges, mining technology, etc. But those are all distinct from the actual "bitcoins" themselves. Bitcoins are a currency created by all this technology, and it is a commodity and has to be evaluated on its own merits independent from how cool the underlying technology is, or how many markets it opens up. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:55:32


You're still confusing the concepts of "base denomination" and "currency conversion."
If I want to sell something on the US ebay for 12GBP, sure ebay will convert it on the fly to USD for buyers. But the item I'm selling is *denominated* in GBP, not USD.
My point is no one right now is *denominating* anything in BTC. They're usually denominating it in some local currency, then giving you the BTC conversion on-the-fly. It's like the earlier poster said: no one's paying their rent denominated in BTC, or accepting a salary denominated in BTC, or signing other long-term contracts denominated in BTC right now. (And just because you can *use BTC* in some of these transactions does not make it *denominated in BTC*. You have to understand what the term "denominated" actually means). BTC's exchange rate is too volatile to make that feasible.

Pyramid != ponzi != bubble
People really need to stop comingling these terms
EDIT: for a refresher:
1) Ponzi = a fake fund where the manager fraudulently claims it's increasing in value, and carries on this deception by paying people who cash out with new investor's money, keeping the difference as profit.
2) Pyramid = a scheme to get people to pay you money by promising that they can do the same thing (get people to pay them money for the chance to get people to pay them money for the chance to ... etc)
3) Bubble = a run up in the market price of a real commodity by excessively high demand fueled by people's belief that the price will keep going up.
In all three of these cases people buy in thinking they're going to make a lot of money and have a good chance of losing it all. But they're not the same thing.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:26:36


No, it doesn't. "Benefiting early adopters" is not a defining factor of a ponzi scheme. Being deflationary doesn't make something a ponzi scheme (is gold a ponzi scheme?). You're just using the term wrong. 
Ponzi schemes are fraudulent funds run by a manager who *lies* about how much the fund is worth to get more people to buy in. Often the fund doesn't even correspond to any real underlying asset. Early adopters can cash out because the manager is getting enough income and wants to keep up the facade. The thing falls when the manager decides to take his profit and not pay out anymore.
The bitcoin bubble, as far as I can tell, was based on honest market transactions. People just got over-excited and paid more than it ultimately was worth. They got what they paid for: a certain number of bitcoins. There was no fraudulent fund manager reaping profit, just people who were lucky enough to buy in early and sell before it popped.

One of the problems with bitcoin speculation is that it's hard to speculate a short position. Yeah, there are a couple exchanges that will let you sell futures or do a short sale, but they're not very liquid and the vast majority of bitcoin trading is simple buying and selling. 
This means the bitcoin market will bias toward the optimistic position and tend to stagnate when people get nervous, since there's few good ways to make money off of the pessimistic view.

They are digitally logged, but not in a central server. There's a P2P network that keeps track of all accounts and transactions.
The basic "bitcoin accounts" are known as "addresses" and are basically a random number created through some cryptographic algorithms. You can create as many addresses you want to hold and transfer money, and none of them have any tie to your actual identity unless you want them to. 
Each address has two parts: the public key (actually this is the actual "bitcoin address" that you give to other people so they can send you money) and the private key (this is a number you keep secret &amp; secure in some way, because with it, you can *extract* money from the address and send it somewhere else).
Software to manage the addresses is called a "wallet" and you can either run one on your computer (and store all your bitcoins yourself) or use one of several websites that will manage your addresses for you (if you trust them). There are other methods too, but it starts to get complicated.

name one.
bitcoinstore? They denominate in USD, convert prices on-the-fly to bitcoin. That one that let you buy from amazon does the same thing.
I have no experience with silk road, but my guess is the same: things are priced according to their fiat value and recent BTC exchange rate, rather than having a "native" BTC value.
Anyone who isn't continuously adjusting will adjust every few days or weeks, at least, again based on the exchange rate.
Basically whenever you buy with bitcoins, you're effectively "importing" from a fiat currency economy, so you have to do the conversion. There is no native bitcoin economy yet, where prices are stable and based on factors internal to that economy rather than external exchange rates (which at the moment, are mostly based on speculation).


Is it *denominated* in bitcoin, as in, we'll pay you X BTC per hour? Or is it adjusted continuously based on the exchange rate?
My company pays me a fixed salary per year denominated in USD. They adjust it once a year for inflation/merit. My rent is denominated in USD and can't be increased for the term of the lease. I don't think there's anything comparable in bitcon right now: every single transaction is adjusted based on the latest exchange rate. No one is setting a fixed BTC price *independent of its valuation in fiat*.

Which means you sent some bitcoins to someone who then bought stuff off amazon for USD and then did some currency conversion.

Well, yes, but a bigger issue is that claiming long-term capital gains for bitcoin earnings is most likely tax fraud. Generally, gains from currency transactions are taxed as *ordinary income* not as capital gains. [You can try wading through the regulation yourself here]( That's assuming the IRS even considers bitcoin an currency and not, say, a form of gambling (though that's also ordinary income). 
Just saying if someone tries putting "$10000 in bitcoin earnings" on their form 8949 they can expect a phone call.

blockchain.info has some estimates for this. The current hash rate is 85,642.72 GH/s and an estimated "650 Watts per gigahash" (I'm guessing they mean 650W per GH/s). Of course this will go down with asic mining, but the hash rate will also go up, so I'll go with this for now.
This gives us 55.7MW. They then multiply it by 24 to get 1336 MWh as the energy used in a day, but that's irrelevant to us.
Let's say a typical commuter car uses 200hp. That's about 150kW. That means the bitcoin network is currently using the same energy as about 370 cars driving simultaneously. How much energy it would be using if bitcoin were a full-fledged currency used by billions is left as an exercise for the reader, but it's a lot more than one car commuting.

And this is only the case because bitcoin isn't really a currency. Or to put it in a less inflammatory way, it's not backed by a closed-loop economy. 
What I mean is, the speculators are important because almost every bitcoin transaction requires a conversion to fiat somewhere close by. Most people can't get paid in bitcoins. Some do, but their companies probably do most of their work in fiat and just convert to bitcoins. Same with most bitcoin "purchases" -- they're often converted instantly to fiat.
On the other hand, most other currencies in the world don't require speculators for liquidity or valuation. Instead, they have entire economies based around them where people spend in the currency, the companies do their business in the currency, pay their employees in the currency, and rarely is it converted to anything else. Unless and until such a "bitcoin economy" can be created, it will always be a speculation-based store of value, basically just a digital version of gold.

This is not a very good rebuttal.


Well yeah, that's the definition of "deflationary." You're saying "being deflationary isn't a problem because it's deflationary."


Are you sure about that? have you sampled "every currency in the history of mankind"? And you're looking at the wrong question: The problem isn't "being worth too much" it's "changing value too much."


This is just silly. Having to pay a premium for something doesn't make it "inefficient." Borrowing entails a cost (the interest) because money now is worth more to you than money later. 
I also think you need to distinguish saving and hoarding. Most people currently "save" in a bank account of some sort. What you're doing in that case is *lending the money to the bank to do other stuff with*. They don't just hide it under the mattress (or in a bitcoin address). They might even pay you interest!
Now if you think of your money as "economic good tokens" that you earned by doing some good for the economy, and you can trade in to get some good back from the economy, by hoarding you're effectively taking that potential economic good and putting it on standby. This can slow the economy down to inefficient levels, where people could be doing good, but no one wants to move cash to give them the incentive to. By saving (loaning) instead, you are letting someone else use that economic good, as long as they pay it back (presumably by doing some more economic good themselves) in time for you to cash it in. This keeps the economy moving.


Again, you're missing the point. The key question here isn't about "too cheap to buy," it's about "how quickly prices are falling." If I know this car is going to be 10% cheaper tomorrow I most likely will put off my purchase. If lots of people decide to do that all across the economy, this just makes prices fall faster and makes the problem worse.
And you miss the second half of deflation: yeah, prices are falling. But so are wages. And so is liquidity. It doesn't help people buy that cheap car when employers are cutting production left and right due to lack of funds. 
Right now this isn't a problem with bitcoin, because you can always switch to a non-deflationary currency to do most of your business in. But we're talking about the "bitcoin economy" which doesn't really exist yet.


This I agree with -- I hate the ponzi scheme comparision. "Compared to Ponzi Schemes by numerous experts" is quite a questionable claim. More like, compared to Ponzi schemes by people with almost no understanding of either bitcoin or ponzi schemes.


Is there some data to back this up? Just curious, because I also agree that the energy use issue isn't really a problem either. My argument, however, would be that bitcoin requires extremely powerful encryption to stay secure, and that's what this processing power is doing, not wasting energy.

Like I said, I know nothing about the CRA, but the IRS has some labyrinthine rules about what can be reported as losses/deductions. 
For example, theft of an investment instrument does *not* count as a capital loss. However, if you were using that investment instrument in the ordinary course of a business (say, you were a bitcoin miner or ran a bitcoin exchange), then you can count it as a business loss. But if you're just an ordinary investor, you're SOL -- *unless* the loss is over a certain percentage of your income, in which case you can deduct it as a "Casualty loss" with some different restrictions.

Newbie here, I was looking into dwolla-&gt;bitinstant. It seems like it'd be seamless (minus the 2 day wait for funds transfer into dwolla). Are there any obvious downsides to this method?

Actually taxes are due quarterly, but most people don't worry about it since they have automatic withholding done from their paychecks that cover it.

Not sure about CRA, but with the IRS, you can only claim investment losses when those losses are "realized" meaning you sold the underlying instrument for a loss. Losing access to it / having it stolen or whatever *does not count*. 
Also the IRS has some really strict rules about what and under what circumstances something counts as a deductible loss (investment or otherwise) -- and I'm not 100% convinced that bitcoins losing value would count as ordinary capital loss. Best talk to an accountant.

I'm not sure people who can't afford 1BTC should really be playing with direct forex trading.

It doesn't make much sense to have a face value if you can load and spend arbitrary amounts from the underlying address.
Plus... whoever printed it up could store the private key :(

It's very hard to estimate the rational market value of bitcoin. Yes, lots of stories are coming out of people adopting, or thinking about adopting bitcoin, and it generally has a much wider public exposure than ever before. But how do you translate that into value, exactly? 
The "rational" value of a currency is how much economic activity is represented by it. How much economic activity is currently represented by bitcoin? How do you measure that? Right now bitcoin isn't being traded on the basis of its rational value, but on the basis of pure speculation. A bitcoin is worth whatever an investor is willing to pay for it. This can fluctuate wildly, especially in a smallish market. 
I personally don't think the value of bitcoin will stabilize until we have honest-to-goodness "closed loop" bitcoin economies, where a normal person or business can spend the majority of their time dealing in bitcoin without translating to another currency. At that point you can start to estimate things like, how much does a loaf of bread cost in bitcoin? How much does x square feet of office space cost in bitcoin? Without having to convert to fiat first. 
The value of bitcoin at that time will depend on the size of these closed-loop economies. Right now everyone's just speculating on what that will be.

It's a decentralized digital system for securely transferring a virtual resource of which there is a limited amount. The fact that it can be used as payment is purely due to the fact that people interpret the resource as having value.
Not that that's necessarily bad. It's very analogous to gold. Gold would be a lot cheaper if it weren't for the fact that lots of people see it as having extra value.
