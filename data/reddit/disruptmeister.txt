If the winning bidder(s) paid more than market price then you should care...
@_date: 2016-06-28 02:20:59
Two more winners, it appears the grand total will end up 5:

 News statement
For immediate release 28 June 2016
EY Australia
EY announces results of Australian first bitcoin auction
 
 
 
 
 
 
EY today announced that it had successfully sold 24,518 bitcoin via sealed bid auction for an undisclosed sum.
 
EY was engaged to conduct the international sale on behalf of an undisclosed vendor. The bitcoin was confiscated as proceeds of crime.
 
The sale was conducted via a 48-hour sealed bid auction and closed on 21 June 2016 at 11.59pm AEST.  Eligible bidders who provided a deposit of USD 250,000 and met the financial requirements to participate in the auction process submitted bids on 11 lots of 2,000 bitcoin and one lot of 2,518 bitcoin. 
 
EY Transactions Partner Adam Nikitins said the auction attracted significant interest from around the world including from bitcoin exchanges, digital asset investment funds and high net worth individuals.
 
Following detailed due diligence, a number of interested parties were invited to participate in the auction and submit first, best and final bids.
 
“We are pleased to report that the auctions were highly successful and all bidders have been notified of the auction outcomes,” Mr Nikitins said.
 
“The process was very competitive and demonstrates the growing appetite for digital assets such as bitcoin.  The value of bitcoin increased significantly over the past month, however bidding remained strong.”
 
Completion of the sale to the winning bidders will occur over the coming days.
 
This was the first bitcoin sale process of its kind in Australia and the second globally following the US Marshals Service conducting several sales during 2015.

Looks like at least 3 different winner to the auction since the following 2 addresses got 2000BTC (1 auction lot) and 4518 BTC (2 Auctions lots)
This is good news. More than 1 winner means more likely chance to figure out who 1 winner was and that they might leak the price.

Original thread has info:
 
I think at least 3 winners here.
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:38:25
Thanks. It was interesting, but I don't think it was related. If the price leaks or when we figure out how many winners there were then it may move the price. Time will tell. Right now this Brexit thing is helping a lot.

We won't know until they announce it or until the Bitcoin starts moving from the address. It was divided up into 12 different groups, each auctioned off separately. An entity could win all of it or numerous entities could win different blocks of 2000. Now that we have the address we will be able to see how it is split up once it is sent. This is the Australian government's holding address.

As I type the BTC is being moved. Same large odd increments as the original 4 sends to that address. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:35:46
Thanks! Hopefully the results leak out and are above the market price. This will help the price.
