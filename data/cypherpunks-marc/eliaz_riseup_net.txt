I can appreciate both views, but I wonder if it helps our understanding
of the problem to glom onto only one of these opposites. On the one hand
participating in Tor gives anonymity/freedom to people (many, I hope)
who use it for communal/good ends. But it also allows a few (I hope)
people to abuse it. Tor's a carrier, it's not its place to censor/judge
traffic. That's a is a function of the cops/courts and of society at
large. If by some horrible chance Tor had an internal monitoring
function, I don't know that I'd opt into judging any HS or user - I'd
probably end up obsessing over each individual case. I'd much rather
spend my time helping to make Tor more anonymous and free, leaving it to
the cops to chase those they think are miscreants. Of course I also have
to fight against the illegitimate use of police/state power. Such is
life. Just MO. - eliaz

I still don't get it. If one believes in something, why not publish it
non-anonymously? Most of the examples given for anonymous publication
speak of small percentages of crazies. The Cryptopolitik article doesn't
show a small percentage of illicit hidden services. Of the 2,723 hidden
cervices that unambiguously met the taxa used, ~57% were illicit.
Analogies to crazies on the roads, etc., take on a different complexion
with such numbers. Gun violence in this country is pretty bad, but 57%?
It's easy to be a libertarian or anarchist at home. These perspectives
have contributed a lot to society; at the same time there's good reason
why they don't work as sole governing principles. For even
self-governance to work, liberty has to entertain constraints. The
Cryptopolitik study & article attempts to set the groundwork for a
non-bureaucratic, non-centralized but purely architectural way this
might be done.
That some people might have a non-criminal reason to host anonymous
sites is a valid concern. But, if "anonymous publication" isn't an
oxymoron, those folks will surely find ways to do it.
Maybe tor-talk isn't the place to talk about these issues. Thanks for
the opposite viewpoints. I'll shut up now, but will be interested to
follow any dialogue that ensues by folks who have waded thru the whole
article. - eliaz

Elaboration: I said in my previous post that I never quite believed that
"there are more good than bad people."  I think it's more to the point
of upgrading tor architecture to say that I don't feel comfortable
relying on "there are more good than bad people" as a justification for
the Tor Project's laudable aims. Regardless of numbers there *are*
people who will misuse tor, and the article gives good evidence that
those people are the ones who employ anonymous content platforms. - eliaz
