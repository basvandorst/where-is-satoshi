Ah ha!  Missed the dot in the command!  Happens with you're old and decrepit. ;-)
Got it!  Thanks, Bryan and Charles.

addmedia is not a parm for urpmi, it is the tail end of a command called urpmi.addmedia.  Simply type the command as specified and Charles' repository will be added as a source.

I did a -h on urpmi and found that there is no parm called addmedia, but there is a parm for update, media, excludemedia, etc., etc.

You may have caught it when I was updating gaim to 0.2mdk.cae.
I do not use the gui but CLI
# urpmi.addmedia eslrahc
with hdlist.cz
Tried this and urpmi came back with "no package named" errors for each one of the parms.

I've tried via urpm_media (the GUI version) to put in your repository but when I tried to add it as HTTP with your URL and hdlist.cz, it got the message that the sytsem could not retrieve the new packages from your site because it thinks the entry for your site is misconfigured.
I've taken it out and won't stick it back in until I hear from you or one of the other more knowledgable folks here.
