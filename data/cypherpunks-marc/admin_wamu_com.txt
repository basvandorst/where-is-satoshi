Dear Washington Mutual customer,
We recently reviewed your account, and suspect that your Washington Mutual Internet Banking account may have been accessed by an unauthorized third party.  Protecting the security of your account and of the Washington Mutual  network is our primary concern. Therefore, as a preventative measure, we have temporarily limited access to sensitive  account features. To restore your account access, please take the following steps to ensure that your account has not been compromised:
1. Login to your Washington Mutual Internet Banking account. In case you are not enrolled for Internet Banking, you will have to use your Social Security Number as both your Personal ID and Password and fill in all the required information, including your name and your account number.
2. Review your recent account history for any unauthorized  withdrawals or deposits,   and check your account profile to make sure not changes have been made. If any unauthorized activity has taken place on your account, report this to Washington Mutual staff  immediately.
To get started, please click the link below:
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and appreciate your assistance in helping us maintain the integrity of the entire Washington Mutual  system. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
The Washington Mutual Team
