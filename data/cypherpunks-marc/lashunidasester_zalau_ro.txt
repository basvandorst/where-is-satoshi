G'ive up:  On Clinton's last trip to Hawaii, he went swimming at Waikiki Beach. He got
caught in a riptide and was been pulled out to sea. Three young surfers swam
out to him and brought him to shore. He wanted to reward them, and asked
what they would like. The first said he wanted to be a fighter pilot, and
Clinton said he would get him an appointment to the A. F. Academy. The
second one said he wanted to command a submarine. "Fine, I'll get you into
the Naval Academy." The third said he wanted to be buried at Arlington.
Clinton looked puzzled and asked why such a young person was concerned about
where he would be buried. "Because", said the surfer, "my father is a
Vietnam Veteran, and when I go home and tell him I saved your life, he's
going to kill me."
Two men, John and Jim, traveling through the country in America, stopped at
a small inn for dinner. On the table there was a large cup of mustard.
Thinking the contents were custard or a sweet of some kind, Jim took a
spoonful of it and put it in his mouth. Tears ran down his cheeks, but
wishing to have his friend John caught in the same trap, he said nothing of
the mistake he had made. The other man, seeing that his friend was crying,
said: "Listen, Jim, what are crying about?" "I was thinking of my father who
was hanged twenty years ago," Jim replied. Soon after, John took a spoonful
of the mustard, and as the tears started down his cheeks, Jim in his turn
said "What are you crying about?" "To think you were not hanged the same day
your father was." came the answer.
