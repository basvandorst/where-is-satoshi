Hi Cypherpunks, What is the ideal dosage for the drug that treats impotence in men? You have to experiment with the dosage and time lag. I started with 50 mg (good to rev my engine, I think) but ultimately found that 25 mg about 90 minutes before sex is ideal for me. Lower dosage means less nasal congestion and more feeling during sex. But 25 mg still leaves me rock hard and able to hold off climaxing just about as long as I want.
