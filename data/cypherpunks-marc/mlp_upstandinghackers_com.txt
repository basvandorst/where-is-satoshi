Why would they even need to use rubber hoses? They could just compel Amazon. How many Tor nodes are on EC2 these days, again?

Hah! I was wondering when someone was going to start throwing parse

Obviously the next step in the arms race is DPI systems that use
correct parsers, but this is hard to do at wire speed. For now,

Ah, fond memories of the 12k march back from my BCT FTX, which I did
on an ankle that I'd sprained twice in three days, making my way from
the rear of the column to the very front as males and females alike
fell back from fatigue. (If you sing cadence louder, the rest of you
hurts less.)
Herp derp exception that proves the rule; your argument is invalid.

Are you referring to the fact that whatever currency he holds is fiat
currency, or to his role as (e.g.) director of Expert Labs, or
something else? (I know little about the man's history, just glanced
at his LinkedIn.)

So, I'm not James, nor do I have much of anything in common with him
at all, but I'm far more creeped out by Anil Dash's self-righteous
chortling over his own perception of holding Dickinson's career future
hostage than I am at Dickinson's firing.
"What is new in our time," Bertrand Russell once said, "is the
increased power of the authorities to enforce their prejudices." Let me ask you this: put me in Pax's shoes. (You can substitute
something offensive I'd be likely to say for Pax's actual words, if
that helps with the cognitive dissonance. Perhaps something about
guns. Or titties, I say some pretty crass things about titties too.)
Suppose I then ended up across that lunch table from Dash, and that
Dash had made the same "you'll never see VC if I can help it" threat.
That's where the cognitive dissonance kicks in too strongly for me to
continue the Gedankenexperiment: Dash would never make that threat to
a woman, for fear of the ANIL DASH THREATENS FEMALE ENTREPRENEUR
headlines that would flow like wine afterward. Dickinson was Fair
Game, in Dash's view, and Dash accordingly displayed all the civility
and restraint of a Hubbardite zealot, cloaked as it was under the
veneer of a genteel Manhattan business lunch.
Anil Dash fancies himself an authority, and fancies his position to be
one from which enforcing his prejudices constitutes acceptable
behaviour. The only authority he actually holds is money and
relationships with other people who have money, but his demonstrated
eagerness to use that authority to punish nonbelievers marks him as a
danger to free thought and free discourse.
Don't let that sycophantic scumbag anywhere near public office, is all
I'm sayin'.

No, in proof of concept it moves data around. You've given us a
back-of-the-napkin sketch without enough information to actually model
your system. You can say all kinds of nice things about a data
transmission system with various crypto primitives mixed in, but you
cannot truthfully say that your system advances the state of either
anonymity or privacy unless you can show that the properties you wish
to preserve hold throughout the system. *Then* you can say it works in
In order to say that it works in practice, there's a whole different
set of hurdles.

Yup. Not only that, .gov organisations all have their own budgets and
spending authority, most of them don't talk to each other, and a lot
of them don't like each other. USG may be a hydra, but it's a hydra
whose heads are so badly tied in knots that noticeable things only
happen when one of the heads gets itself some wiggle room.
Also, neither "government funding" or even "DoD funding" *necessarily*
imply that DoD has any say over what ships. I don't think I'm the only
Cyber Fast Track participant on this list, but
 was funded through CFT,
and anyone is welcome to audit the source and read the commit logs; I
can tell you who all the committers are, most aren't American, and the
ones who are are me and my partner. Our interaction with DoD (or,
well, our contract facilitator) consisted of "Here's the latest
milestone" --> "make && make check worked, here's the money for that
milestone" every few months. That's all.
I hear some variation on the "Tor is a government op!" drum banged
every six months or so, so I guess it was time. Can we at least get
some variation this time, maybe spin some conspiracy theories about
Paul Syverson instead of falling back on that tired old canard about
Roger's internship? Or aliens? Working Area51 in would be cool.
(Disclaimer: of course I don't think Syverson is a plant, nor do I
think Tor is a honeypot. Do not harass Paul Syverson or his family, or
the least I will do will be to throw a habanero martini in your face.)

All I ask is that whatever comes out of it have an unambiguous BNF
definition for its message format, without  rules if at all
possible. (See also: "enable interoperability".) Bonus points for
defining the protocol itself as a finite state machine.
WebCrypto is a shitshow in large part because the people at its wheel
perceive a need for JavaScript programmers to make decisions about
what cipher mode to use. They're dead-set on forcing developrs who
write Javascript because C is hard to make low-level decisions that
affect the reliability of their code in profound and non-obvious ways,
and refuse to understand that this approach never ends well.

There's an even better reason for this: BitTorrent leaks your IP. What
good does onion routing do you if the exit node can see where you are?
If you want to use BitTorrent without revealing your IP, get a VPN.
