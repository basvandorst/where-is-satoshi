From the url in the key, I am assuming it is a tor hidden service, hence
you would need a local MTA able to route over TOR.
tempted to have a go myself this weekend, given I haven't seen a tor
smtp implementation before and it intrigues me...

Well, I do have Certpatrol - but Ironically, it was the larger providers
that make it useless; by issuing different certs to different servers in
the same loadsharing farm, they caused the system to alert almost
Certpatrol allows you to pin one layer up (i.e. pin the CA, not the end
certificate) which cuts down on some of the noise (such as google
properties, thankfully) but not all of them.  It only takes a few days
of the thing crying wolf before users uninstall., and knowing which
sites to CA pin (and understanding what that actually means) is another

Which is good marketing, but not a reflection of reality (i.e. a "big
name" CA and a relatively unknown one are both treated the same by
validation checking)
Still, when you are in the business of selling the illusion of trust
validation, admitting to reality isn't likely to be a large part of your
game plan :)

You would think they would go down the path of setting up their own CAs
for that - cheaper to set up a working group between them, get a HSM
based root, and issue signing certs to member institutions....
