You must keep the followups on the list, Steve.

you must have moved your perl or rebuilt it without shared library after
building perl (or may be it's a prepackaged software, in which case you
don't have the prerequisite installed).
The simplest way is to build mod_perl by yourself. See:

Starting httpd2: Syntax error on line 3 of

into server: libperl.so: cannot open shared object

Does this mean that libperl is not installed or something else
