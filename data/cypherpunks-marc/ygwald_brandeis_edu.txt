Why is it that everyone here rocks at threat models as long as they get
to own a computer. Why is it that everyone here can consider everything
from if a Global Passive Adversary is directly targeting you to if your
next door neighbor is doing, I dunno, Van-Eck Phreaking or something
like that, but can't *possibly* consider the use case of "my government
can break into any computer it wants, and I'm running from netcafe to
netcafe, and just need them to not be able to find me for the next one
or two weeks".
A keylogger only compromises you once they find the logs to read --
But say they've got a thumb drive with their data and software, two legs
(or one, or none, depending, I suppose), a car, and the driving will to
*keep running and fighting*.
"You shouldn't be trusting your life" my rear. Half of these people are
expecting a knock on their door every day. You think they're gonna just
give up because they can't be Perfectly Cryptographically Secure?
So we can give up on them, or we can give them whatever help they can
get. Two. Choices.
...sorry for ranting. But, like, could we *please* at least consider
scenarios where people don't control their computer? Instead of just
totally dismissing them off-hand? Like, there *is* stuff they can do,
and there *is* stuff we can do for them. And it's just... *wrong* to
just say "go hang".

I interpreted that as jokingly interpreting "anti-gay" as "the opposite
of gay" -- so "heterosexual".

Nooo... "anti-gay"... If an anti-gay person touches a gay person, then
they mutually annihilate into pure energy, which can be
captured/focused/however-the-heck-it-works to power warp drives...
(Because I usually suck at sarcasm, I'm going to explicitly state that
this is sarcasm, and also a (bad) Star Trek reference...)

You're not thinking of it from their perspective.
Everyone on this list understand the value of Free Software.  That's
because everyone on this list understand software at all.
It's very, very important to understand that most people... just...
don't.  For 90% of the entire population of the entire planet -- even
while their lives are literally being run by computers -- a computer is
absolutely nothing more than a Magic Box of Lights.
Which means that "source code" -- and thus "Free Software" -- is
literally meaningless to them.  There's a prerequisite for the Four
Freedoms that goes unmentioned, because it's just assumed as obvious to
almost everyone who ever discusses them.

I'm guessing that it was the discrepancy between the first one and the
second two.
The actual issue with the whole Brendan Eich thing was that it was
basically just LGBT people being played off of Firefox for money. Like,
(and I could be wrong, I wasn't really paying attention that much at the
beginning) I'm 90% sure it was actually a pretty small thing that could
have totally cooled down, until OKCupid literally BANNED Firefox users
from their site to build up a controversy where they were the "good guys".
It reeks of being entirely a money play, and I challenge you to *not*
see a boardroom of people running the numbers like "well, we have this
many Firefox users, and if we block them for a day we'll lose maybe this
percent... Johnson, can you and PR give us an estimate for how much
we'll gain from PR for this" ... "Oh, we'll be driving a pointless wedge
between LGBT activists and Software activists? Well, lemme just wipe
away all my tears with a 20$ bill to show exactly how much I care about

Also, isn't Briar aiming for Mesh Networking? Which is a whole nother
area than what TextSecure is aimed at.

Are the cops responsible for it not the ones being charged?
If they are, CNN has the doxx. (
 )
("Responsible" here means "directly responsible", as opposed to
"responsible by virtue of participating and encouraging the abusive and
violent police culture")
I personally am against Doxxing -- in general, I'm only okay with it
when there has been a public demand for the identity of a public
official, which has been refused.
Because then they're the ones potentially putting innocent people in
danger. There were clearly other options.
(Depending on the circumstances, "against" could mean anything from
"actively yelling at people doing it" to "just staying out of spreading
it, and telling other people to too".)

Is there any way that the protests could use help on the tech front?
I heard a bunch of things about the Baltimore PD being sure to keep
track of livestreams and I think also checking Twitter photos?
So maybe someone running their own StatusNet or Pump.io or something, so
that the Baltimore PD aren't at least getting the data firehosed from
the source?
(Of course, that would require getting the message out to everyone to
