Can anyone from the Tor Project jump in to say whether these guys have
reached out or not?
We should be concerned about another CCC-style "0-day" presentation where
they find a legitimate vulnerability that could have been patched prior,
but are using it as a PR stunt to boost book sales as opposed to
responsible disclosure. Alexander Volynkin [1] and the grad student Michael
McCord, [2] both stand to benefit professionally/financially from
disclosing a vulnerability in as dramatic form as possible.. and of course
picked up and misinterpreted by the media.
I'm raising this concern based solely on the negative phrasing in the
drugs, and malware. Anyone

Worst case stated, I don't want to hate on researchers -- the two should be
praised for their research if they have something new and they've already
been working with the Tor Project team to get it resolved.
If I were a betting person, a beer says that they will be summarizing the
current issues with hidden services, and as Adrian said, doing a client
side disbanding attack (e.g. Java + DNS)

It appears that someone has been issued a facebookcorewwwi.onion cert
from another CA as .onion has no way of verifying a collision.

There are a lot of tools out there that generate vanity hidden service
addresses. Facebook merely used something like Shallot [1], or they
purchased the hidden service address off of one of the domain brokers that
are hosted as a hidden service. Generating an address does not mean
cracking an address.

The research shows that being AS-aware will reduce timing attacks (that
NSA, GCHQ and other well funded groups can support) from 58% chance of
exploitation, to 5.8% by strategically creating circuits with more
divergent AS owners. I wouldn't get hung up on Astoria itself as it's
mostly just a PoC for additional value to their grant writers and
university. The functions can be (relatively) easily integrated into Tor in
the future. I suspect there may be some expansion on the Tor circuit
building algorithm it uses. [1]
It's also a great summary of the new threat model based on some of the
recent disclosures. No longer academic threats, we now see examples of
timing attacks in the wild.
