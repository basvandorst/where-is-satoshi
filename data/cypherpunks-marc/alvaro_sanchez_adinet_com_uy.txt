A very common action is to blackhole ddos traffic upstream by sending a bgp route to the next AS with a preestablished community indicating the traffic must be sent to Null0. The route may be very specific, in order to impact as less as possible. This needs previous coordination between botnets) may be completely unaware that they are part of a DDoS. I do not mean the bot machine, I mean the ISP connecting those.
is deployed in production networks today.
generally unaware that their machine is being used for nefarious to attack besides adding more BW or contacting one by one the whole path of providers to try to minimize the effect.
a signalling protocol between ISPs to inform the sources of a DDoS attack in order to take semiautomatic actions to rate-limit the traffic as close as the source? Of course that this is more complex that these three or two lines, but I wonder if this has been considerer in the
