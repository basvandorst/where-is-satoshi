You should really do some *relevant* research first.  And focus on
your *own country*.
    the /Wallace v. FSF/ case has been dismissed, with Mr. Wallace
    ordered to pay the Free Software Foundation's costs. Mr.
    Wallace's fourth Amended Complaint was dismissed and the Free
    Software Foundation's Motion to Dismiss was granted. It's the
    Order that tells Wallace to pay the Free Software Foundation's
    costs. Judges do that when they'd like you to learn a good
    lesson. It's a signal you shouldn't have brought the case in the
    first place.
    So, the end result is, the GPL went to court, and the judge not
    only upheld it, he said this:
        [T]he GPL encourages, rather than discourages, free
        competition and the distribution of computer operating
        systems, the benefits of which directly pass to consumers.
        These benefits include lower prices, better access and more
        innovation.
    I'm sure that was not Mr. Wallace's intention, to strenghten the
    GPL. But he did.

It's a fear-mongering rant by someone who forgot to take his lithium.
See, every intellectually void cause *needs* a Villain.  John
Ashcroft used to be The Villain.  Now that he is gone, Alberto
Gonzales and Sam Alito share the post.
