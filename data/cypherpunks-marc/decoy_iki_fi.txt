If this applies throughout the whole economy (i.e. the natives can't
compete with any product at all), you'll have a trade deficit and sooner
or later the currency rate will go down. That'll end the imports and even
out the difference in efficiency.
In the absence of a currency area boundary, you'll still have Ricardo and
his principle of relative benefit (that the term?). Nobody'll starve
because of competition, unless they're just plain lazy and/or unable to
adapt. Sweatshop work is a variation of the latter.
If the previous buyers get their food cheaper somewhere else, what's the
problem? That production can survive within the confines of an inefficient
economy is no reason to keep running that inefficient economy. Otherwise
you'd be transfering income from the buyer to the seller, and
inefficiently at that.
They made a choice over starving to death. Sounds like a choice to me.

A bare one objection to comprehensive market based security: a market
needs private property, and other civil rights, in order to function
efficiently, as predicted. Protection is what guarantees those rights. If
you place protection on the market, you no longer have a guarantee that
the market itself can function as originally intended.
Cf. piracy (in its original form) -- an evolutionary system like pure
market economy (anarcho-capitalism) will likely settle in a state with
parasitic activity present. It is not clear that this stable state (you
would call it a Schelling point) would not include a major proportion of
rights violating commerce (like mafia protection rackets and the like).
Hence it is not clear that it indeed guarantees maximum economic
efficiency; it might be just a local maximum.
The above, of course, has very little to do with Tim's analysis of private
security of the airline industry. But it does have a lot of relevance to
placing *all* of the normal police activity in the private sector. If I'm
not wrong, Tim's essay is part of precisely such an agenda.

I see no reason why sufficiently reliable RFID notes (say an MTBF in

But if this is really such a problem, one would expect the issuer to be
able to invest a fair amount of money per bill in circulation into
verification methods in excess of what you'd typically see in a grocery
store -- a reasonable MTBF and enough circulation through the issuer would
lead to few notes getting into a bad shape to be passed this far up the
chain. Thus, failed notes could be replaced at a cost not much higher than
that incurred by routine check-ups, only with a greater delay.
Besides, there's a point in invalidating failed bills -- if this is not
done, where's the incentive for people to keep the stock in shape? A
monetary economy, by itself, *can* adapt to lost bills via deflation, and
bills going invalid is something nobody really wants to experience.
Also, it is likely that deflationary pressures arising out of economic
growth will completely drown out any effects lost notes might have on the
larger economy. The implication is, wear and tear of bills can be
accurately analyzed by treating them as a slowly devaluing physical good,
and the usual efficiency arguments apply.

possible to make counterfeit notes detectable by signing a hash of a
measurement of such randomness by a well known public key and barcoding it
on the bill: if one possessed the key, one could produce arbitrary looking
bills and just sign the hash. If one didn't have the key, and couldn't
cheaply enough reproduce whatever gave rise to the measurement, one
couldn't reproduce a valid-looking note. The randomness could come from
things like turbulent deposition of magnetic/fluorescent materials on the
bill, something one might assume to be fairly expensive to reproduce

On the contrary. Piracy, when defined your way, is a basic right. If
someone has information and can copy it, it is in no way the author's
concern. It would be if the author subsequently didn't have the work
available, but that clearly isn't the case. Since information can be
copied without in any way diminishing what the author has, piracy isn't
theft. Copyrights, instead, severely limit what individuals can do with
the information, equipment and other property they have.
Copyright is an artificial limitation on people's rights, upheld on
utilitarian grounds. It's a practice of granting a monopoly on some
information by fiat to correct a market that is supposedly broken. It
certainly isn't a property right, and the law doesn't pretend it ever was.
Instead what copyrights are is a monopoly on certain kind of
information/speech, backed by coercive power. Copyright is a compromise,
and the reasoning behind its current form of is quickly becoming obsolete.
Under the circumstances, it's no great surprise that there are such things
as copyright wars.
Well, then we shouldn't support them. DRM does not stop copying. If it
did, we wouldn't have a DMCA hanging over our heads.
Sure. But one part of a functioning legal system should be that conditions
which cannot efficiently be enforced should not be. From my viewpoint,
conditions put on by an author are tantamount in idiocy to the Firstborn
Clause, and have nothing to do with what can be enforced.
Au contraire. Unless your conditions are fully compatible with the right
of individuals to do whatever they want with their CD-ROMs, T1s and P4s,
they should not be respected.
Intellectual and physical property are two institutions which cannot be
meshed. You can have one or the other, but if you try both, you will end
up with all sorts of nasty contradictions, or a severe bunch of
limitations and easements to one of the institutions. Also, anything you'd

utilizing what protection we have for physical property. The only

No. I can very well acknowledge beforehand that I will take all gifts

Well, this would be if there was a contract between me and the artist in

@_subject: millicent ghettoes 
In the wake of the recent public goods postings and some related traffic
on a couple of Finnish mailing lists, the concept of transaction costs has
somehow managed to dominate my time. That sort of thing has a lot of
unlikely consequences, some of which I think are highly CP relevant.
While I tend to agree with Tim about the shorter term trouble with
micropayments -- the fact that such payments, well, do not pay -- I'd say
in the longer term micropayments are what counts, and not perhaps
anonymity. The reason is, most of the economy is, and I think will remain,
over-ground. People really don't have enough to hide to make anonymous
payments mainstream quickly enough. Sure, they have their applications,
some of them radical. It's true they will shake the society quite a bit.
But the shadier applications can always be controlled, given the
vulnerability of the anonymity infrastructure itself.
But micropayments, they are another deal entirely. If and when they become
practical, we can envision a whole range of previous unheard-of mass
transactions taking place. The kind which need millions plus people before
they actually become profitable. This is the situation I alluded to in the
public goods example, and any market oriented solution to the problem of
coordination will eventually have to tackle the issue of aggregating the
cost. That's the problem micropayments, as an idea, are meant to solve.
So, what's so notable about such transactions? Simply the fact that they
are new. In the past entire classes of transactions (the foremost example
would be the ones we nowadays see in the international financial markets)
have been enabled by lowered transaction costs. I don't think the spread
of micropayments will be an exception to the rule. In fact I would argue
that the only *lasting* surprise offered by AP was the fact that when mild
wants of large numbers of people can be coordinated, economic efficiency
can lead to significant, and heretofore unexpected, outcomes (i.e. getting
a notable figure killed).
In the end I think such new classes of financial transactions, borne of
lowered transaction costs, will be far more significant to the society as
a whole than anonymity. I also think this is the essence of what is
driving the wider P2P cirlce, at the moment, though few people seem to
realize it. So, I would deem it quite likely that the millicent ghetto
will eventually run over us.

@_subject: Re: Markets (was Re: Hayek was right. Twice.) 
Believe me, they're all known to me and properly appreciated.
But that's precisely my point. If you want to serve an interest which is
widely spread, with little willingness to pay on behalf of each of a
couple of million beneficiaries, you will have a public goods problem. One
way to arrive at such a problem is to demand everything of a single
system. But at the same time there are a number of monolithic problems
which achieve the same by themselves. That's what I was talking about.
Of course. We might argue that has to do with the dependency of a gift
economy on income effects feedback which gives a good deal of nice
outcomes when people are nevertheless getting richer. Somewhat pointedly
the question becomes, could Open Source keep up the rise in income by
itself? Is it a productive part of the entire economy or a parasite on
existing forms of welfare creation?
Again, my point in a nutshell. When a problem is grave enough to warrant
an investment on behalf of a single developer, that single developer
*will* develop the software and, at the very least in the absence of
copyrights, face a very low price on open sourcing the code. But there's
still the kind of software which gives some tens of millions of people a
per capita benefit of, say, $1 a year while requiring a clear, centralized
development effort with considerable cost. Cryptix hardly lies in that
category, even while extremely useful to a number of people.
Aye. PKI is a tarpit. You get into it, but only rarely do you find someone
who cashed out on it. In this case it isn't the market that fails,
Nobody's putting open source down, here. Far from it. My point was an
economic one, having little to do with those forms of software development
which obviously work. It wasn't even meant to advocate a particular
approach to financing the production of goods infected by the problem.
Instead it was a simple reminder of the limitations of the commonly
accepted image of free market, purely bilateral trade attaining efficiency
in a general sense, without any regard for transaction cost analysis.

Even if you neglect market failures in the usual sense, an outcome such as
everybody becoming a slave to a single individual is Pareto efficient --
you can't dissolve the situation without hurting the slave owner. Pareto
efficiency talks about allocation, not distribution, and so the latter can
be arbitrarily skewed in a Pareto efficient economy. Even to the point of
apparent absurdity. It's a different thing altogether, then, whether you
can approach such a dismal state of affairs via Pareto moves...
I don't think so. Instead I'd say that is Marshall efficiency in the
absence of transaction costs. The trouble is, you can never make everybody
happier by redistributing since someone will have to pay the cost. (Here
we of course assume that everybody wants more of everything.)
More to the point, there is a redistribution which would allow the total
amount voluntarily paid by a large number of people exceed the amount a
minority is ready to pay to avert the cost of the redistribution.
(Nowadays I'm thinking this isn't bad in itself, but that amplification of
this sort of pattern via returns to scale is.)
Quite. But on the other hand, public goods reasoning is also a very, very
dangerous thing. Consumption side externalities are my personal favorite.
Suppose there is a considerable personal benefit to rich people in seeing
the average bum spend his money in something respectable instead of
liquor. In this case, liquor consumption has a visible externality, and
optimal provision calls for institutions which more or less tax the rich
and use the proceeds to encourage the bum to straighten up. Now, that
doesn't sound *too* bad in itself, but when you apply the same reasoning
to the educational needs of the young and the societal benefits one would
expect of a highly educated younger generation...

Quite. Coase's reasoning demonstrated that any initial allocation of
property rights is equivalent (both in the allocative and distributive
senses) when transaction costs amount to nil. So, if we look at the
distribution side of the information industry, you're absolutely right.
The smaller the transaction costs the better -- rivalry applies to any
particular copy, as it does to services involved disseminating the bits.
Any trades required are bilateral, competition does its job and everything
is just dandy.
But if we look at the creation end, that's a different story entirely.
Anyone eventually receiving a copy will benefit roughly equally from the
efforts of the artist/author. If copying and distribution are exceedingly
cheap, as we'd expect them to be in the future, the number of people for
whom acquiring the information would be profitable easily grows to the
tens or hundreds of millions. Since any copy released will be widely
disseminated, the deal between the original author and the public with an
interest in his work will be multilateral in the extreme. It cannot be
reduced into a bunch of bilateral trades as in the case of private
commerce. This means that we get sizable transaction costs. IP is there to
force the economy into something approximating the conventional, material
one, and so internalize externality otherwise generated. (No, it does not
solve the problem. But limited term copyright could still strike a
near-optimal bargain.)
If something, Coase's original point is behind copyright, not its
antithesis. That's why I rarely use economic reasoning to argue for IP
abolition, even when I consider IP a bad idea.

No. It is the case with the digitized version, but not the work. Nobody
would argue that actual copies aren't normal, private goods. One time,
when copying was difficult, there was even a one-to-few correspondence
between works and copies. Today that isn't the case. Replication and
creation are now neatly separable, and benefits of scale in the former do
not translate to returns to the latter. Copies are still a private good,
as ever, but works are becoming increasingly pure public goods. According
to orthodox public goods theory, that might well be a problem.
In practice the issue is muddled beyond belief, of course.
Did this thread really start with something taken from LMD? The list
really *has* stooped to an all-time low...
The point in copyright wars is about incentives to authors vs. the right
to copy privately, not about the ease of copying. Sure, microtransactions
are a possibility. But when the yield does not go to the one who created
the master copy, why should anyone create anything, anymore? (Or, more
realistically, why should people create at an efficient level?)

Of course not. Am I not making this precise point?
However, that sort of property isn't anywhere near the kind one would
expect of a free market commodity -- it isn't severable. You can't legally
sell or buy votes.
What can I say, barter in time and effort is probably the best sign of a
gift economy in action.
Of course they can. However, not one of those parts is useful in itself.
You don't sell a set without the actors, or vice versa. That's the
problem. With Linux, each individual utility is useful in itself. If
someone needs the functionality, one just codes it and releases. In many
cases that's a few days work, and a good part of the benefit goes to the
coder himself. Consider then something like a novel. It's not very useful
if you tear out the last 50 or so pages, is it? Whoever is making and
paying for the effort (perhaps with his time, as is the case with
volunteer projects) has to be willing to invest enough to finish the work
before it acquires real value. That value is then thinly spread over a
considerable number of readers many of whom have to be willing to pay for
the effort if the novel is to come to being in the first place. When I
talk about modularity, I talk about it in the economic sense of
divisibility, not the technical one of being able to create a single act
of a play, a movie set, a Java class or an actor's performance in
isolation. The trouble with public goods comes around when no single
person is willing to pay for the whole project, but a million or so in
toto would be, barring transaction costs from things like freeriding. If
you grok it, I can't help you.
Hollywood blockbusters? Hardly. That was what I was talking about from the
start. Besides, I do know a couple of Finnish low budget directors. Only
rarely do I find the tenacity to actually delve into their work. Money
isn't everything in movies, either, but it's still a lot.
First, there is nothing wrong with being a "stupid user". Stupid users are
who software is mostly for, aren't they. Second, it's not the whole
install, it's details like getting X to work with a nonstandard display
memory config. I'm not exactly unknowledgeable about software, but I'm no
kernel hacker either. Do you think most people should be?
Throw in the fact that this precise relativity is what the whole of
economics revolves around, and the table turns quite nicely.
Did I somehow limit the question to money? If so, that's certainly not all
that I meant. The economics of public goods apply perfectly well to
nonfinancial compensation.
In fact, copyrights do not have anything to do with money, per se, only
with the establishment of a property right in abstract things. If people
behave the way you seem to think they do, we will slide into a
nonfinancial information economy even in the presence of copyright; Coase
was brought into this, and it's still relevant. If you start from the
normal assumptions relating to laissez-faire economics, you'll also assume
transaction costs to be negligible and a stable, unique equilibrium to
exist, in which case any initial allocation of property rights will lead
to the precise same outcome.
Actually I'm not advocating a whole lot, here. Right now I'm mostly making
a point about public goods and Coase's theorem, and their connection to
the institution of intellectual property rights. As I said, I'm an IP
abolitionist and free-marketeer myself.
But if you read what I've posted so far a bit more carefully, you'll see
that that is not at all what I've assumed.
Not true. A simple example would be people shunning someone in opposition
of their (mostly) shared moral code. This is a typical example of
publicness (everyone has to gain by still interacting with the shunned
individual) and some of its civil counter-forces (morality) in action.
Examples of trade which are necessarily multilateral are everywhere if
you're just willing to look. The interesting part is how to cheaply get
around the extra costs incurred by the setting. You're not helping a whole
lot in that department.
True. But the issue only gets interesting when you can explain why, and
also why the market does (or doesn't do) better.
(I'm also thinking it's high time for me to shut up.)

currently covered by IP) and you're bound to fail. Unlike with Linux, the
individual parts of most larger projects involving IP are of no use
without the surrounding whole. Unlike Linux, many IP products aren't
modular, reusable or decomposable, and so they can only exist if you can
find a single source of financing for the whole project. In the case of
modular projects, you can rely on overlapping interests to fill in the
voids, but most projects aren't like that. Especially if all that the
creator gets is the ever-diminishing value of a single copy.
Why is it that there's no Buzz for Linux? No decent installer? (Not one of
them survives my hardware...) No workable Unicode support? A stable 64-bit
filesystem? Why is nobody willing to guarantee kernel stability, even when
paid big bucks? 'Cause the project is a gift, and only caters to a single
kind of need: something an individual developer/company really needs and
can afford to develop for him/itself, then losing little by exposing the
code to others. Usefulness thinly spread over a considerable user
community is completely forgotten.
Well, what stupid people they are. I wouldn't go anywhere as far as

@_subject: Re: Real-world steganography 
I'm not sure about HDCD as a technology, but the principle is sound. If we
can compress sound transparently, we can also transparently embed quite a
lot of data into the part which is perceptually irrelevant. We might also
depart with perceptual equivalence and go with perceptual similarity
instead -- e.g. multiband compress the audio, and embed data which allows
us to expand to a higher perceptual resolution. Whatever the
implementation, putting data in the gap between statistical (i.e.
computed against a Markov model) and perceptual (against a perceptual
similarity model) entropy which compensates for some of the perceptual
shortcomings (like total dynamic range) of a particular recording
technology seems like an excellent idea.
However, applications like these have very little to do with steganography
proper. In this case, we can (and want) to fill up the entire gap between
statistical and perceptual entropy estimates with useful data, leaving us
with signals which have statistical entropies consistently higher than
we'd expect of a typical recording with similar perceptual
characteristics. That is, the encoded signal will appear manifestly random
compared to typical unencoded material from a similar source, and we can
easily see there is hidden communication going on. Such encodings will be
of little value in the context of industrial strength steganography used
for hidden communication.
Steganography used in the latter sense will also have to be imperceptible,
true, but but here the entropic gap we're filling is the one between the
entropy estimates of our best model of the source material vs. that of the
adversary's. Be the models Markov ones, perceptual, something else, or
composites of the above. Consequently the margin is much thinner
(bandwidths are probably at least a decade or two lower), and the aims
remain completely separate.
Consequently, I don't believe encodings developed for the first purpose
could ever be the best ones for the latter, or that HDCD-like endeavors
really have that much to do with the subject matter of this list.

Provided there's a nonlinearity, effective in the ultrasonic range,
somewhere. Mere interference (which is what we usually refer to as
"beats") doesn't give rise to intermodulation. The beat, it isn't an
audible frequency per se, but double the frequency you'd need to amplitude
modulate a sinusoid halfway between the original sinusoids to get an
equivalent result.
You can do it with a single beam, too. MIT's Sonic Spotlight is one
example, but there are better developed applications on the market.
However, you need huge amplitudes to get the air to distort. (I've heard
numbers in the 130-150dB range.)
I don't think it would. Before the nonlinearity gets to do its job, the
sound needs to be conducted to the inner ear. But it probably won't be --
our ossicles and the tympanic membrane are too massive to operate in that
frequency range.
So I agree if the amplitudes are extreme, but otherwise I doubt it.

But that's just the point. They need to have the raw signal available at
one time or another. Picking it up and sending it down the line should be
utterly trivial, too. It will have its price, but the price will also be
negligible. Especially since the ATAPI protocol has steadily grown more
complicated, which would suggest they are making libraries to handle it in
a standardised fashion. If they have such a library, and the raw data, why
shy away from yielding it to the user? I mean, the cost is far less than,
say, implementing digital rippping capability in the first place, with the
available chips.
I'd guess either because of a) terminal stupidity or b) benefits to scale
in making it sure people go with compatibility. As there probably have to
be some limits to how stupid engineers capable of making things like

It wouldn't leak, and I've never really understood why standard ATAPI
drives don't allow access to the raw data. As you say, that sort of tool
would have quite a number of applications besides piracy. For example,
taking MP3 backups of my CD's, I already would have needed error
concealment, a feature CD-ROM's do not implement when ripping audio. You
can't implement that well without knowing where the error correction step
failed, and that data isn't easily available.
Also, I've always been fascinated by the fact that there's really no
reason to follow the CD specs beyond 8/14 modulation other than
compatibility. A writing drive capable of working at such a low level
could be used to experiment with new encodings beyond what standard CD's
can do -- say, substituting CIRC with RSBC and gaining some extra room on
the disc, getting rid of the subchannels, a more intelligent coding of
disc addresses... Breaking compatibility wouldn't be too useful, but it
sure would be fun. Now you simply can't do it.

No. There is also the concept of a rational bubble, where people invest into something because both them and the others settle into a rational game-theoretic balance where everybody thinks everybody else values a commodity, hence they value the commodity themselves, and thus the commodity in question continues to be valued indefinitely. A cycle involving boom and bust is just a special case of a rational bubble, and a very specific one, whereas the general case doesn't much predict any The general case also involves stable valuation of the commodity in question, when some real backing is present. Which would then usually be called a (fiat) currency, or (an unbacked) security. As soon as such a commodity establishes liquid markets wrt other commodities, it has a real chance of becoming a bona fide currency. No matter where it came Take for example Virginia tobacco at its time. It became a medium of exchange, and it remained so long after it had lost its use value by spoilage, in individual cases.
BitCoins perhaps aren't backed up by anything, but so aren't useless cigarettes or fiat-pieces-of-paper. Nevertheless, the latter work just fine. (Modulo independent, political and macroeconomic concerns over whether they're the best possible currency.)
BitCoins are of course far short of the real cryptocash that we'd want. But their worst problem isn't about bad economics, practical monetary concerns, or whathaveyou.

I would tend to disagree here. It's not too difficult to defraud with double entry, either: just appear sloppy. Yes, I know, the system's value is usually painted as deriving from this primitive form of error correction, consistency checking and redundancy. But really I think it's more about something else -- equally trivial -- that took me a long time to figure out since the accounting literature doesn't much help you I think that something has to do with the asynchronous, multiple-input-multiple-output nature of how a firm operates, and people's highly limited ability to deal with more than one single thing or aspect of things at any one time. This dawned on me when I had to partake in a scheme used to manage a collective liqueur cabinet. It eventually evolved all by itself into a double entry system, which I went on to describe in
 .
Thus, I think that we shouldn't be considering the trusted (distributed) third party in BitCoin on an equal footing with the innovation of double entry. Fundamentally I see them as performing separate roles, with the trusted verifier being the only one that has relevance wrt security. A better comparison in the world of accounting would be how receipts are kept, balanced cleared, different ledgers compared with each other by an independent accountant, or perhaps procedures where different people own different accounts and need to establish mutual trust upon a transaction before accepting it.
Well, there's also the point about Byzantine failure tolerance. At the very minimum it always takes three parties to guarantee that even a single malfunctioning party can be reliably voted down. That's why mirroring wouldn't be any good by itself, without the independent check from the underlying error correcting code. BitCoin goes with the general version, and tries to limit each party from having more than one vote (or too many votes) by imposing a computational challenge which is economically limiting "in the real world".

Has anybody tried to write a truly anal parser/normaliser/rejecter to All except Message-ID can be dropped without jeopardizing service. Message-ID, well, that's just such a basic part of the service that you'd have to go with zero knowledge proofs in a funky and expensive way if you wanted to get rid of that one.
We need them *too*. Doesn't mean we shouldn't sanitise our outgoing (and incoming, because of replies) email all the same. Automatically. With minimum hassle. On as many platforms as needed.
True Names. They're now there. So let's deal with the problem.
Yes, SMTP is the basest problem. It's difficult to get around envelop addresses in the clear and all that. But above you talked about something within the protocol which *can* be sanitised. Let's do that, programmatically, at least, and right now. After that, it's suddenly *much* easier to deal with the address on the envelope.

How, precisely, compared to what we have now?
My and most cryptoanarchist's hope, I believe, is the precise opposite. At least I think BitCoin is woefully inadequate in the anonymity department, and should be made better so that no action group, government, anybody at all, can trace godfuck about what happened with it. Most certainly that "dirt" is just the killer app for any and all crypto currency. Not a bug, but the primary feature of the arrangement.
I on the other hand worry about how much transparency such intermediates still afford. Because there should be none at all. Full opaqueness is what we ultimately strive for. Or why do you think anybody would want to go with crypto in the first place?
Good money is *individual*, *distributed* power. Not power in the sense of a central despot. It's power in the sense of power to the people, individual and several.

In general, why does anybody do anything but binary formats in crypto, anymore? They just invite all sorts of padding trouble and what the hell not. If you have a clean proof, even against an oracle model, in something as beautiful as GF(2^8), why the *fuck* do you have to mess it up by translating to those very linefeeds and shit you usually really don't understand nor mostly can do right in the first place?
Just goddamn dump the bits. Pretty much everything is 8-bit-clean nowadays. Nobody sends email anymore. TCP most _certainly_ is 8-bit-clean. Fucking dump it down the socket, guarded by a proper MAC. How difficult is that to comprehend, really?

So is yours: obviously you can *have* and *use* it, it's just that you can't *export* it to the *terrorists* and the rest of the bad people who aren't you.
Perfectly consistent. Of course perfectly fucked up from the viewpoint of a foreign libertarian like me as well. But it really is fully consistent, and it was so from the very start, right downto the basic classical liberal ideology I as well share: "there is only one correct law, it is universal, if you don't share it then you haven't Been Enlightened yet, and thus we for very good reason don't Mind you too much". "Till you join our movement of universal rationality..."
So, then, as it's basically a valid argument, how about taking its contraposition? "As we then already know crypto is right, and it'ss used by precisely the right, righteous people all round, should it not be the case those who make a claim against are simply wrong."
Should it not in fact be, that making a case against free crypto should be taken as a prima facie case of the speaker being a fascist, against democracy, a luddite, and an all-round bad guy? Out to get immortalized as the next Hitler?

Isn't the whole point that "they" will always phrase this sort of thing to an individual's disadvantage, against the constitution and human rights, and that then the only way to fight such tyranny without killing yourself and/or embarrasing them is to have a popular standpoint and/or enough of an extant legal fund. I mean, obviously not to defend yourself, because you can never succeed in that, but in order to make you an unattractive target to begin with? Mutual assurance of destruction, and all that.

The one password they could never divine is \epsilon\epsilon. Two empty strings in a row.
Now I can see how some of you might object that it's then just one empty string in whole. I disagree: whoever told you passwords have to obey normal monoidal string axioms? Quite certainly arbitrary amounts of non-visible, un-greppable, in-representable void between and on characters *will* prove an un-stoppable counter-measure.
Truth be told, every *nix installation really should have available 1) a commonly available dictionary, 2) a true/hard randomness source (don't go there), 3) an easily usable means of combining your own off-the-cuff source of randomness with whatever you get from your hardware, 4) a cryptographically speaking hard mixing function, and 5) a stupid-as-fuck freeware utility to fold all of that into an XKCD-hard password. Preferably the lot residing in its hard parts on your Android device's tamper-resistant whatchamathinga, with open interfaces and a dozen or so independent implementations of each part.
Of course you can attack something like that. Duh. But compared to what we have now, it'd be a total hoot.
