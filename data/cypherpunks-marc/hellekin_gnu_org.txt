*** Theoretically yes, but in reality there are many reasons why
Facebook may not be a choice: your academic course might require a
Facebook account (yes, I know), your social circle might all be there,
and not joining may exclude you from that circle (e.g. "didn't you know?
 Foo published it in our FB group."), etc.
You may choose not to use Facebook, but then, you'd better stick to your
activist circles.  On the other hand, not choosing Facebook but
accepting their ToS is more common than you think.

*** Hmmm, not really.  It illustrates how well the military-industrial
complex can keep the leviathan state in line with its interests.
Argentina has the truck drivers lobby--aka Big Oil, that managed to keep
the rails off the landscape, while the truck drivers are perceived as
"rolling back the power of the leviathan state".
But you nailed it: NRA managed yearly budgets in the 100s of millions.
That's some "tier pressure".

*** You can help push the P2PNames Internet Draft through IETF to ensure
that there's at least a standard technical support for
censorship-resistant alternatives to global naming on the Internet.
We've been on it for more than a year now.
Please review the draft[0] and send your comments for inclusion in the
upcoming revision due for next week (you may also join  on Freenode
IRC).  So far we've reached consensus from the developers of GNUnet,
Tor, I2P, and Namecoin, and are all working together for technical
recognition of these alternate naming approaches sealed in Internet
history by IESG and IANA.
Although the approach is technical, the struggle is highly political:
IETF has cold feet using an existing mechanism (RFC6761) to tell IANA to
reserve TLDs for peer-to-peer name systems that obviously consider
centralized management of names a non-technical, bureaucratic obsolescence.
If you're on Twitter, use the  hashtag.  If you're on DNSOP or
DNS Privacy lists, or any relevant WG of IETF, please hum.
