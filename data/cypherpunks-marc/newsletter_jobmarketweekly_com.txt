10 Job Searching Tips From Santa
Heather Wieshlow, Certified Career CoachAttitude: Don't be a grinch or a humbug. During the job search process it is extremely important to keep a positive attitude about the future and your abilities. Stay away from people who tell you how "bad" it is out there, they won't help you get your job any faster. Your attitude shows in your non-verbal communication and in what you say and how you say it.Preparation: Start early; there is a lot to be done. The job search process requires strong organizational and project management skills; plus focused time to do the tasks. Just as Santa starts early to prepare for his big day, so should
you. Work on personal and professional preparation before your interview day comes along, so that you are ready and you can be at your best. Time Management: Intention and purpose is the key. Santa only has 1/1000th of a second per house to jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, put the presents under the tree and eat the cookies and drink the milk before he moves on to the next house. Impossible you say, well once you get your job search underway, it may feel a little like Santa's schedule. Use a tracking sheet to document who you spoke with and what you accomplished on a weekly basis, set specific goals as to how many resumes you want to get out, how many networking contacts you want to make and how many
follow-up calls you will be making. At the end of your week, assess your results and keep clear on what your intention and purpose is.Marketability: Know who you are, what you do, how you do it and be proud of your successes. There is no mistake about who Santa is or what he does and why he does it better than anyone else. He walks and talks the part, and so should you. Be able to identify and communicate your strengths and skills easily so that a perspective employer can see the value you would bring to their company.Countability: Know if you have been bad or good. Be able to look at yourself honestly and know where your successes have been and what your areas of growth are. If you find
you have a specific area that you need to work on, begin the process. No blame, no shame, just get back in the game.Perspective: Your greatest challenge may be your greatest gift. Just as Rudolph found that his greatest gift had been previously the thing that all the other reindeer teased him about; find your place. If you have been through a difficult time, figure out what the learning was in the situation and see how you can utilize it as strength as you go forward.Give: The gift is in the giving When networking with others remember to give. There is nothing worse than someone who is just trying to make contacts for a job and doesn't care about the person that they are speaking with. When speaking to others find out what they need and see how you can help them succeed. Remember to do your follow-up, share what you need and continue to cultivate the relationship based on trust and giving. You may never know whom the next contact will be that can help you find your next position.Renew: Take time for milk and cookies The job search process is an emotional and strategic process. If you haven't taken time to renew yourself mentally, physically and emotionally a future employer will sense it. Take time to renew and "sharpen your saw" so that you are more effective at the search and in the interviews. Support: It's hard to do it by all by yourself, even Santa has a team.
Doing the job search alone can be difficult, frustrating and lonely process. Explore job search groups through your state  or other groups like 40 Plus  and the Five O'Clock Club  These groups specialize in working with professionals in career transition and are a great source of training, networking and information. Also consider a professional Career Coach or Counselor who can help you identify where you are stuck, offer you insight and design a plan of action to move you success.Believe: Miracles do happen at Christmas and all year long. Yes, Virginia there is a job for you too. You may feel discouraged in your job search but there is a position for you.
 You may need to switch your process, revamp something you are doing or get some assistance from a professional, but you can get the position you are looking for.Heather Wieshlow is a Certified Career Coach in Laguna Niguel, CA owner of Turning Point Coaching and Consulting and works with professionals in Career Transition.

Free Business and Trade Magazines
Make no mistake, staying on top of the news and trends of your industry are an integral part your job search. In fact, according to a recent survey conducted by Beta Research Corporation, on behalf of The New York Times Job Market, the majority of employers (85%) surveyed agree that keeping up-to-date in a candidates field of expertise is a very important tool for conducting a successful job search.So, whether you're looking to move up or to move on, reading business and trade publications can definitely help you move right in to the job of your dreams! For starters, being fluent on the latest trends in your profession can be invaluable while networking or interviewing. These
magazines keep you sharp, well informed, articulate and in-demand!To help you stay current, Job Market Weekly has arranged for its readers to instantly subscribe online to practically every leading industry and business publication, at NO COST to you. For more information or to sign up to your industries trade magazines for free, Follow this link.Imagine how being able to make conversation about the latest industry trends and events can be used as an ice breaker while networking. You can stimulate conversation by asking the opinions of others on industry developments -- all the while appearing to be the well read, well informed expert.In fact, the
person with the most power in a conversation is often the facilitator of the conversation -- the one asking questions and opinions of others, listening intently and showing respect for everyone's answers. Beware of taking a position too strongly, being argumentative or coming off like a know-it-all.Your ability to demonstrate keen industry knowledge in conversation helps you project confidence. It also makes an all important yet unspoken statement that you are dedicated and conscientious about your chosen profession -- inspiring others to instinctively feel confident about your skills and abilities. Now that's the position you want to be in while networking!Industry trade magazines also provide other wonderful opportunities
for job seekers. The most obvious of which are the industry specific help wanted sections that many have, offering jobs you may not find using traditional job seeking methods.In addition trade publications offer other less obvious opportunities. Their articles can provide wonderful networking leads and the perfect reasons to give them a call. For example, imaging reading an article about a new program that a company is mounting in your area of expertise. And suppose the article also quotes an executive of that company. This gives you the perfect opportunity to call the executive quoted, offer a compliment on the new program and introduce yourself as someone who might be able to help -- or perhaps might be a good addition to their
team. Even if they don't need to fill a position, they may call you in the future or possibly refer you to someone who does.In addition, most industry trade publications list a calendar of events or trade shows that can offer you wonderful networking opportunities. And many of these shows offer free exhibit hall passes just for the asking. The exhibit floor of a trade show is a place where you can meet executives from many the companies in your field -- all in one place.So if you don't regularly read your professions industry trade magazines perhaps now is the time to start! Job Market Weekly has arranged for it's readers to receive a complimentary subscription to trade publications in practically every leading
industry. It's quick and easy to do. It only takes a minute to search their website and quickly find the magazines matching your skills and interests. You can search by publication title, industry, or geography. Next, pick the magazines you want, fill out a brief online subscription form and press submit. It's that easy!

Five Myths About Holiday Job Hunting By Sinara Stull O'DonnellWhen I was an executive and a corporate recruiter, I found that December was my busiest and most stressful month. It's no exaggeration to say I often made job offers on Christmas Eve and came in the day after Christmas to do the paperwork so that an employee could start Jan. 2.Yet, the misconception that nobody hires in December is common, as is the poor advice that "you might as well take the month off." It may seem counterintuitive, but the opposite is true.Holiday job-search myths have been around for a long time and are repeated like mantras, but shatter when scrutinized. Consider the following:Myth No.1: "Nobody
hires in December"December is still a month employees are being paid to work. There are five reasons companies may hire in December:1. Many companies must spend the money in their budgets before the end of the year. Hiring "heats up in December because hiring managers are trying to reach deadlines to use budgets," says Susie Basanda, principal of Basanda Consulting, a recruitment management company in Ventura County, Calif.2. People tend to want to tie up loose ends before the new year. Hiring managers, human-resource representatives and executive recruiters are like the rest of us who have that feeling of urgency as the year-end approaches. If there are unfilled positions on their staffs, hiring managers
naturally want to fill them. 3. Positions open up in late November or early December because many professionals quit their jobs this time of year. As David Knowles, a senior recruiter with Excel Unlimited, an executive search firm in Houston, says, "The holidays can bring on a time of longing to be closer to family, roots and people. If no bonus is involved, people often will quit Dec. 1, and give two weeks notice so that they can be with family for the holidays." 4. Headhunters are more motivated to place candidates before the end of the year. Almost all executive recruiters are paid on commission. This commission is based on fees their company earns for placing professionals. What helps the December job seeker is that
this commission rises based on overall yearly billing. One might start the year at 30% and graduate to 60% by December. The catch is that it goes down to 30% again Jan. 1.5. Strong companies often want to start the new year with a bang. "Companies that are forecasting profits want to have key people in place to start the year off well," says Knowles. Myth No. 2: "You won't find the job you want in December"You're just as likely to find the job you really want in December as in any other month. One reason is because you won't have as much competition, says Judy Kneisley, senior vice president and general manager for outplacement firm Lee Hecht Harrison Inc. "Because so many people believe in the myths, it's a
perfect time to be out there," she says. It may sound logical that only losers would be desperate enough to look for jobs during the holidays, says Knowles, but "the fact is that winners are looking in December." Winners don't give up.Myth No. 3: Nothing ever happens after Dec. 15, so you might as well leave townMost recruiters advise job candidates to be flexible in scheduling interviews and meetings around the holidays. Eberhart goes a step further and advises candidates to avoid taking weeklong trips during the holidays. Basanda once held a round of interviews New Year's Day. Myth No. 4: Even if an employer has an opening, the hiring manager won't have time to meet with youThe interviewing
process can be slower during the holidays because of the number of days people are out of the office. But, as Basanda says, the process "will slow down but it doesn't stop."Myth No. 5: You'll have a better chance if you wait until the first of the yearIf employers have a need, they don't care whether it's January or December. "[Hiring] isn't focused on the time of year. It's focused on need," says Keith Mills, vice president for Aaron's Automotive, a manufacturer in Springfield, Mo.Ms. O'Donnell is a free-lance writer and a career consultant in Springfield, Mo.

By George Blomgren , The Benefit CompaniesI know an older candidate, currently unemployed, who feels perpetually discriminated against. He believes employers see him as inflexible, unwilling to learn new skills, set in his ways. Honestly, I think he works hard to live up to these attitudes. They are so apparent - along with the bitterness he feels for being perceived this way. But I've never known him to do anything to alter these perceptions.Another colleague is almost 15 years senior to my friend. In contrast, she radiates a tremendous depth of knowledge and experience. She is amazingly hip to new
technologies, trends, and attitudes. She's way ahead of me in identifying workplace challenges, she works hard to stay one step ahead, and she's not bitter about anything, not even significant health problems.These two older workers, one employed and one unemployed, embody prevalent stereotypes. We've all met them many times before, in one form or another. The stereotypes are so common it's easy to quickly pigeonhole older workers into one or the other. If you are an older candidate, this is a challenge you face. The good news is you largely control which way you are likely to be seen.I am not making light of the challenges older workers face, suggesting there is no such thing as age discrimination, or implying that the
solutions are instant and easy. But I do want to highlight two specific things about these older workers, and why I believe they are perceived so differently.First, each is seen very much the way that they see themselves. Granted, this isn't always the case - we all know people whose self-image is skewed. But it is universally true that our attitudes tend to inform the way we present ourselves and the way we are seen. Whether or not we can deliver on the impressions we project ... that's another story.Second, perhaps as an extension of the way they see themselves, both of these older workers act accordingly. The older of the two reads voraciously, she takes and teaches classes at the local community college, and she makes a
point of keeping herself on the forefront of her field. The embittered gentleman, in contrast, often grumbles about how he "doesn't have time to keep up with every stupid new fad."A recent study confirmed a common link between creativity and age. Add to that the variety and magnitude of experience older workers often bring to the table, vast personal and professional networks, maturity and wisdom - what a powerful package. But these qualities and gifts aren't inevitable consequences of age. They are the results of choices we all make, through our lives and our careers.George Blomgren is an Operations Manager with The Benefit Companies
( and has been on both sides of the fence. Now that hes on the hiring side, he is generously sharing his expertise to give you an edge in your career search.

Tips For Frustrated Job Hunters
George BlomgrenMy articles often elicit frustrated email messages sent by job hunters who are trying their best but feel they aren't getting anywhere or who have had bad experiences courting prospective employers.Job hunting can be a very painful and daunting experience. And let's be honest: a job hunt entails many things that just aren't fair. Interviewers will promise to call, and many won't. You're required to be on time for an interview; the interviewer may keep you waiting half an hour or longer. There are any number of "hoops" you'll need to jump through, often with no rewards. You'll be
judged repeatedly, often by people entirely unqualified to judge you. It's hard work with no compensation, and it may take a long time before it pays off. Ouch.Having acknowledged these unfortunate truths, accept them and make the most of a painful situation. Remember that your competition (other job seekers) faces the same challenges. You're all on the same uneven playing field, facing the same unfair challenges. Many of your peers will struggle terribly with this fact.Make a mental game of it. One way of looking at it is that competitors who face the unfairness and hard work with the most positive attitude and persistence are the ones who do best. Choose to be one of them.I used to work with a sales manager who
told new telemarketers that their job was simply to bring him 50 "no's" a day. This surprised many of them. As he explained, "if you bring me 50 'no's,' I know that the 'yes's' will take care of themselves." That's a piece of advice that translates well to a job hunter's situation. Remember that sometimes you can learn from the "no's" you face, but often you can't. Just move ahead, stay focused on opportunities, and keep a positive attitude.George Blomgren is an Operations Manager with The Benefit Companies.

Pursue Your Dream Career This Year
By Stacey Mayo, MCCEvery year, people resolve that THIS New Year will be different: "This will be the year that I write that book, start that new venture, double my income, take more time off to spend with my family," and the list goes on and on. However, when people think about pursuing their dreams, they often squash the idea because it doesn't seem practical.Does this sound familiar? You have a dream, but are afraid that if you pursue it, you would risk giving up what you already have. It is easy to put it off to a later date -- a time when there will be more money, more time and/or when the kids
have graduated from college. However, there is never a time when everything in your life is perfect for carrying out your goals. Don't wait for everything to be lined up. Once you actually commit to your dream, things will begin to fall into place. Know that is possible to live out your fondest dreams AND make a great living!After supporting thousands of people across the globe in making their personal and professional dreams a reality, I have found the following strategies to be most effective:First, design your life around your priorities. Many people try to fit their dreams into their life and complain there are not enough hours in the day to make it happen. If you want your dream to become a reality, make it a priority.
For example, Stacy Allison, the first American woman to climb Mt. Everest chose to live just outside of Zion National Park so she could climb rock cliffs in her own backyard. Climbing was her priority for many years and she made choices in alignment with that.Second, handle the basics (food, clothing and shelter) then reach for fulfillment and self-actualization. If you can't stand your job any longer or have been forced out and you need a source of income, get a low-stress interim job to pay the bills while your pursue your dream.Visualize every step of your dream and watch the magic unfold. For example, an experiment conducted by Australian Psychologist Alan Richardson found a 23 percent performance improvement among
subjects who visualized every day for 20 days.Mary Youngblood went from welfare mom to Grammy award winner. Mary visualized herself out of welfare. She did this by writing a short story about a young welfare mother. It was her story, basically, and how she was discovered having great talent and was able to get herself up and out of welfare. She pictured it happening in her head and then took action in alignment with that picture.Laser in on one idea, business or income stream at a time. One of the mistakes people make is diversifying too quickly. This is true whether you are trying to build multiple streams of income or are just working on several different ideas at one time. The key is getting the first stream or idea up
and running and having systems in place so it will keep running without you before going on to the next unrelated stream.This is one of my biggest lessons as it is for many entrepreneurs and creative people. When I was writing, I Can't Believe I Get Paid To Do This!, I was also looking for real estate investments, which was a new venture for me. I wasn't making much progress on either front. When I put the real estate to the side and committed to finishing the book, it happened quite easily.And last but not least, develop your resilience muscle by bouncing back from setbacks. You will very likely have setbacks along the way. Don't get stopped by these bumps in the road; learn from themStacey Mayo is a certified career coach and author of I Can't Believe I Get Paid To Do This! Remarkable People Reveal 26 Proven Strategies For Making Your Dreams a Reality, which shares insights into the experiences of millionaires and other remarkable people who have achieved high levels of success.
