Of course. But this isn't about that. At least not for me. The reason I don't like DRM is that it stops me from enjoying the music I buy. Unfortunately record companies are already getting started, which got me into trouble a few weeks ago. I wanted to purchase a CD, but it had something called "copy protection" which made it impossible for me to listen to it. I e-mailed the record company asking what I should do but got no reply. So, I gave up, and downloaded the album from the internet instead, since it was the only way I could think of to get the music. Now, being an honest man (and also wanting to express my opinion) I sent a letter to the record company telling what I had done and why, and enclosed a $10 bill since I wanted to pay for the music.
