@_subject: A question 
Does Flood reuse SSL session id's for ongoing connection requests to the same server? Or does Flood leave it empty for all new requests thus forcing regeneration and exchange of session keys and other related data?
I am doing some test over here and we are desperately looking for a tool which does it (which keeps sessions I mean).
If  sessions are destroyed anytime the system is overloaded to much and the test is not significant at all (actually users keeps sessions during browsing)
It's just and idea.
Thank you for your help.
