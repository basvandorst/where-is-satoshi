I've been given the fingerprints for the tor nodes ran by William to help
verify the story.

William will be posting a statement soon which will explain everything
that's happened and give a detailed account of events, along with evidence
including pictures showing the aftermath of the raid in his apartment, as
well as copies of the warrant and inventory of seized items.
He runs a large ISP in Austria and is a well respected member of the
community, a lot of us have already sent in donations.
His blog is  and I'm guessing the statement will be posted
on there, I'll send everyone a link once it's finished being written.
