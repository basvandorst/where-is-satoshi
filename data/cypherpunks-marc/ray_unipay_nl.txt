17.1201 actually contains a definition:
(B) a technological measure ''effectively controls access to a
      work'' if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation,
      requires the application of information, or a process or a
      treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain
      access to the work.
I confess that I can't tell whether this implies that everything is
effective or that nothing is.

It could also be that a large chunk of the "Cert-host mismatch"
results are for alternate names of servers validly configured.
Also, it is not clear how multiple categories are counted, e.g., a
server with an expired cert from an unknown signer.  Even if there is
no double counting, if servers are counted as "Unknown signer" or
"Expired" before "Cert-host mismatch", then multiple names for the
same host could also inflate the numbers for those categories.

To make their denial credible, they could give the owner access to the
private key of the TPM/SCP.  But somehow I don't think that jibes with
their agenda.
If I buy a lock I expect that by demonstrating ownership I can get a
replacement key or have a locksmith legally open it.

This may be a silly question, but how do you know that the source code
provided really describes the binary?
It seems too much to hope for that if you compile the source code then
the hash of the resulting binary will be the same, as the binary would
seem to depend somewhat on the compiler and the hardware you compile
on.  But this means that you also can't just use the TOR you compiled,
as you then won't be able to unseal any data sealed with the standard
TOR.  Or do I misunderstand how this all works (very likely the case)?

Although I support the vote-with-your-wallet paradigm, this analysis
seems overly simplistic to me.  Macrovision doesn't solve problems for
most VCR purchasers, but they pay for it anyway.  They have no choice.
In some cases people are required to buy and use something that they
might not otherwise be inclined to pay for, e.g., catalytic converters
in automobiles (which also use palladium).  It doesn't seem reasonable
to similarly require TCPA in computers, but legislators might think
(or be lobbied) otherwise.
If the fears that some people have expressed prove justified and TCPA
becomes primarily a means to enforce draconian copyright restrictions,
then people may well choose to pay for it just to regain pre-TCPA
functionality.  In that case, the problems it solves for them are the
same ones it causes!

A trivial observation: this cannot be true across hardware platforms.
TCPA claims to be "platform and OS agnostic", but Palladium does not.

Sorry, I see from an earlier message of yours that you are looking for
a simple non-crypto solution, so I guess this doesn't fit the bill.
The examples you gave in your earlier message all seem to be
equivalent to having the participants send the data to a trusted third
party who performs the computation, except that the trusted third
party is transplanted to one or more of the participants computers,
which are protected against their owners.  I guess it boils down to
whether or not the level of trust is sufficient.  This seems iffy when
one of the participants is also the trust provider.

The model and the goal are a bit different, but how about secure
multi-party computation, as introduced by Chaum, Crepeau, and Damgard
in 1988 and subsequently refined by others?

I took a look at the archives as you suggested.  If it matters to you,
I wasn't referring to your classification of Anonymous as an idiot
(which I hadn't seen because it wasn't sent to the cryptography list),
but rather to an earlier comment ("Wow.  You must really be an
idiot.") from somebody else.  Looking back at that message, it appears
that it was sent to the cryptography list but not to cypherpunks.
Discussion about TCPA/Pd continues, and I hope that disagreements
needn't degenerate into name-calling.

But feel free to make
  whatever assumptions you like about my motives.  All I ask is that you
  respond to my facts.
I, for one, support your efforts, even though I don't agree with some
of your conclusions.  It is clear that you hold a firm opinion that
differs from what many others here believe, so in making your points
you can expect objections to be raised.  You will be more convincing
(at least to me) if you continue to respond to these dispassionately
on the basis of facts and reasoned opinions (your "normal style"?).
Calling Lucky a liar is no more illuminating than others calling you
an idiot.
