I think you a overestimating how much real entropy you will collect this
If you the adversaries you are concerned about are moderately resourced
they could be able to model this entropy source.
There are a relatively small number of CPU clock frequencies in wide
use and variations on mains frequency are easily discoverable by others,
e.g. other servers at your co-lo. Also, at least in the UK, there are public
records of these variations such as;
