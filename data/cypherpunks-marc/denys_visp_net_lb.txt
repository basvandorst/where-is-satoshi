Usually we are preparing for solar interference before 1-2 month, and  we know exactly when it will stop :-)
 Plus it is happening max 10-15 minutes per day, and i had complete  outage for few days.

Yes, for sure.
 Satellite operator doesn't provide much help, but uplink proposed for  us some plan to solve all this issues.
 Already we implement temporary solution, and things at least stable  now, plus it seems interference is lower somehow few last days.

I am monitoring solar activity, getting info from NOAA. No correlation.

It is PLL LNB, one carrier, we are using full transponder 36 Mhz. There is almost no other users on this satellite (inclined more than 1.5 degree), and other carriers center frequency 100Mhz away.

Difficult, in Europe EIRP of transponder is too low, to try.
By the way interference almost disappeared yesterday, and it's much better

Yes, for sure i did. I am running C-Band at this location not first 		
years, and know very well how industrial sources looks on spectrum analyser, and it is easy to triangulate them (i can go up to 9Ghz).
Vessel radars also relatively easy to catch, especially with sound

Yes, on short (few minutes) sweeps it is clean. During long time run, with 100 Khz resolution, if we run few hours we can catch anomalies on the carrier. Important note: this snapshot done on spectrum analyser in Europe, same transponder, and results similar, so it looks like interference is on transponder. Issue start to affect us at same time when people in Lebanon got local interference issues.
Here is snapshot of carrier spectrum with anomaly:

I try to install C-Band bandpass filter, no effect at all, so it is in-band interference. Putting foil (yes i try almost everything) near LNB doesn't affect interference level too.

I'm sysadmin of Lebanese ISP. Almost at same time i got heavy interference on few of my C-Band carriers, and it looks like electronic warfare jamming, because i can see phase modulated, very weak signal, but it is completely breaking almost any communications on my carriers.
Strange thing, that our uplink station confirm that interference is not local on my side, but on satellite carrier. If this will be confirmed, that means it is not just miscommunication between authorities about frequency usage, it will be intentional damage for Lebanese communications.
Sure it can be coincidence in time or something else, but last 6 years i experience similar terrible interference only during 2006 Lebanon vs Israel
