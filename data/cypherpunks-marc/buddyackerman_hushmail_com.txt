It's probably not that hard to defend against discovery in this way by putting
it near other energy-intensive facilities.  For example, outside my window
right now is a 25MW generator that runs at about 30% output except when the
Tokomak down the street is running.  If a key takes only a few minutes to
break, it doesn't seem like it would be that hard to hide a MW or so of power
consumption while the Tokomak is starting up or shutting down, especially if
the Bernstein device is physically close to the Tokomak.
If the potential to hide such a device exists at non-government facilities, there's no reason to believe that the government couldn't do at least as good
a job of hiding their new toy.

@_subject: physical transactions 
In all the discussion concerning turnips in the past few days, I haven't seen any discussion about a subject I would think most would be interested in---secure and/or anonymous physical transactions.
Is it really the case that a provably secure physical transaction is simply impossible?  I've searched for references on this and have found almost nothing.  In particular, it seems that the best anyone has to offer for anonymity is dropping a letter in a mailbox on the sending end, and having a p.o. box arranged anonymously on the receiving end.  Neither of these are all that great.  As far as security, it seems like keeping someone from snooping in the box you're sending involves tamper sensors that destroy the contents.
The sort of security and anonymity I'm interested in would allow, for example, an anonymous version of EBay where "illegal items" could be bought or sold.  Examples include firearms, controlled substances, and even organs.  Assuming that anonymous digital cash &c are available, the only remaining problem is transferring the goods physically.  (Granted, the assumptions about digital cash are a bit of a stretch, but I'd argue that their problems are dwarfed in comparison to the problem of physical transfers.)
Is this just a pipe dream?  Is it provably impossible?  Or have people actually been thinking hard about this and producing results?
