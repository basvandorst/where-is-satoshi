After hearing about the recent defeat of Sony's copyright protected CDs in Europe
with a marketing pen and having visited the above issue on the EFF site,
I spend some time thinking up schemes for watermarks detected by ADCs and
ways to defeat them.  Do not copy watermarks could be defeated by masking,
similar to the marker obscuring the security track on the Sony CDs.  If you
don't mind screwing around you could always transpose color components
going to the display device (similar to plugging RGB BNC connectors wrong.)
You could write software that inverse transposition on color components of
the captured data.
I don't think it is possible to built in watermark detection that can't be
defeated, even if detecting a watermark were to be required for operation,
it could be defeated.   I imagine it would be easier to buy smuggled in
devices.  If you didn't mind supporting your now a little more respectable
and reformed drugged lord or terrorist organization striking back at
the Great Satan by allowing ordinary citizens to exercise Fair Use.
I suppose it is too much to ask that the Justice Department investigate
these guys and the Pols they own under RICO?
Can you imagine watermarks on billboard advertisements?  How subliminal.

If the U.S. wasn't in an undeclared 'war', this would be considered
an unfunded mandate.  Does anyone realize the cost involved?  Think
of all the spam that needs to be recorded for posterity.  ISPs don't
currently record the type of information that this is talking about.
What customer data backup is being performed by ISPs is by and large
done by disk mirroring and is not kept permanently.
I did a bit of back of the envelope calculation and the cost in the
U.S. approaches half a billion dollars a year in additional backup
costs a year without any CALEA type impact to make it easy for law
enforcment to do data mining.  The estimate could easily be low by a
factor of 5-10.  AOL of course would be hit by 40 percent of this
though, not to mention a nice tax on MSN.  Call it ten cents a day
per customer in fee increases to record all that spam for review by
big brother.  I feel safer already.
Whats next, censorship?

The following had been mysteriously pared off my first response to
the above:
Anonymity is generally considered a a requirement for the political
process in the United States to protect the right to express political
speech without regard to being harrassed by those in power.  There
have been several federal court decisions in the last few years that
have struck down laws limiting anonymity for political speech.  One
that comes to mind was a requirement in Chicago, I think that required
the authors name on political phamplets.
Would a law requiring such technical measures for controlling access
to copyrighted information as proposed by representatives of Disney,
et. al. in the U.S. Congress recently that incidentally by design
prevented anonymity be found to be unconstitutionally limiting freedom
of political speech on the internet by its chilling effect?
On a slightly different note, copyrights are given to authors for
a limited time.  Should any technical protection mechanisms enacted
subsequent to law also be required to adhere to those limits? (as
in copyright expiry)  This could have the nice side effect of not
allowing extensions to copyrights be issued retroactively.  One
could also hope that fair use were enforceable under any law,
preventing copyrights from becoming absolute.
We could see society reshaped to fit poorly written laws.  Something
George Orwell could have foreseen.
