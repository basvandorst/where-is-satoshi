HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT MAKES YOU MONEY WHILE YOU GIVE TOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS BIRTHDAY GIFTS.
BELOW YOU WILL FIND A LIST OF 10 PEOPLE THAT HAVE JOINED THIS BIRTHDAY GIFTING CLUB. BUT FIRST HERE IS HOW IT WORKS.
YOU SEND EACH OF THE 10 PEOPLE BELOW $1.00.
PRINT OUT 11 COPIES OF THIS. PUT ONE COPY IN ALONG WITH THE THE $1.00. YOU INCULDE A COPY SO EVERYONE CAN SEE THAT THEIR NAME IS IN THE SPOT IT'S SUPPOSE TO BE IN, NO CHEATING IN OTHER WORDS. WRAP THE $1.00 SO IT CAN'T BE SEEN. THE 11TH COPY YOU KEEP (IN A SAFE PLACE) BECAUSE ON THE SAME DATE YOU JOIN FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS YOU DO THE SAME THING. BE SURE TO PUT YOUR RETURN ADDRESS ON THE OUTSIDE IN CASE SOMEONE MOVES OR SOMETHING, YOU WON'T JUST GIVE YOUR $1.00 TO THE POST OFFICE.
NEXT YOU MOVE EVERY NAME DOWN ONE PLACE AND PUT YOUR NAME IN THE NUMBER ONE SPOT. NUMBER 10 WILL BE OFF YOUR NEW PAGE. BE SURE TO GET EVERYONE MOVED DOWN 1 SPOT.  WILL BE   WILL BE  AND SO ON. HERE IS WHERE THIS PROGRAM IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PROGRAMS. MOST DON'T WANT YOU TO INVITE YOUR WIFE OR HUSBAND OR FRIENDS TO JOIN, BECAUSE THEY THINK YOU JUST PUT THEIR NAMES ON THE LIST AND DIDN'T SEND ANYONE THEIR $1.00 GIFT. THAT'S WHY YOU SEND A COPY WITH YOUR $1.00. (EVERY YEAR) LETS SAY YOU ARE JOHN DOE, YOU JOIN AND SEND EVERYONE THEIR BIRTHDAY GIFT THAT'S ON THE PAGE YOU JOINED FROM. YOUR WIFE WANTS TO JOIN HER NAME IS JANE DOE, WITH THE SAME ADDRESS, LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE IS CHEATING THE PROGRAM. NO BECAUSE JANE DOE DOES THE SAME THING HER HUSBAND DID, SHE SENDS EVERYONE ON THE LIST A DOLLAR INCULDING HER HUSBAND AND MOVES EVERYONE DOWN ONE PLACE.SHE WOUND BE  HER HUSBAND  GET IT? SHE PRINTS OUT HER 11 COPIES, SENDS OUT 10 AND KEEPS 1 FOR THE NEXT YEARS. EVERYONE ON THE LIST WOULD SEE THAT SHE JOINED WHEN THEY GET THEIR DOLLAR AND SEE SHE DIDN'T CHEAT THE PROGRAM. EVERYONE SHOULD GET FAMILY ANY FRIENDS FIRST AND THEN TRY EMAIL OR OTHER PROGRAMS TO GET MORE TO JOIN. THIS PROGRAM WORKS GREAT IF YOU DON'T CHEAT IT. IF YOU JOIN AND HAVE 10 PEOPLE JOIN AND THEY GET 10 TO JOIN, THAT 10X10=100X10=1000X10=10000X10=100000X10=1000000X10=10000000X10=100000000. ALL THESE ARE DOLLARS. DON'T STOP AT 10 IF YOU CAN GET MORE THAT'S JUST MORE BIRTHDAY DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
