Simple reason: the terrorist acts were despicable. The terrorists, their

travellers should be hunted down and killed. There is no debate on this
point among civilized human beings. The only real question on this is
how many civilian deaths are acceptable in killing the terrorists.
By contrast, there is plenty of room for debate on the measures being
taken and proposed by the Western nations, and on the motivations of the
politicians behind these measures.
Bull. Annoying though Tim sometimes is, there's a big difference between
denigrating someone because you dislike his views or actions, and
killing thousands just to make a point that you don't like some other
people. And Tim's put his effort where his mouth is, writing articles
and code to further his agenda, while Osama Bitch Laden sent others to
die to further his agenda. No comparison at all.

So they don't have to be the ones to slaughter the pigs. It's

By the way, terrorists are generally not considered soldiers for

Hey, now, we don't want to be violating the Geneva and Stockholm accords
ourselves. Right, which is what I was saying about airdrops with consumer goods as

Probably some of them do, the Joe Talibans I mean, not the not-so-smart

and are relying on the misinterpretations of mullahs with agendas. Same
thing happens with Christianity. Latin America had several preachers

@_subject: Dealing with Islamic terrorists, and with Afghanistan 
Here's tidbit regarding the handling of Muslim terrorists: in 1911,
General "Blackjack" Pershing was dealing with terrorists in the
Philippines. He caught a handful of them, made them dig their own
graves, tied them to stakes near the graves, and brought up a bunch of
pigs. He told them that the pigs would be slaughtered along with the
terrorists, and they'd be buried together, thus not only denying them
the benefits of heaven but sending them straight to hell forever. He let
one of the terrorists "escape" to spread the word. There was no problem
with terrorists the rest of the time Pershing was there. The question
is, why shouldn't we do something like that now? It's obvious a
significant part of the Moslem world will never love the US, so we
should make sure they fear us instead. (Wes Pruden mentioned this in his
Washington Times column recently. I haven't found it elsewhere on the
Web, but have seen it in print.)
Re attacking Afghanistan, I don't even see why we're talking about going
there in any kind of force, nor why there's talk of bombing it. We don't
have a quarrel with the mass of Afghanis, but with the Taliban. Most of
the Afghanis don't like the Taliban, either. We should be dropping care
packages --- food, cheap radio receivers, some consumer goods, and guns.
Drop so many packages that even if 3/4 of them are intercepted by
"official" forces, there'll still be plenty of guns in the hands of the
ordinary people. I did some back-of-the-envelope number crunching: Two
MREs, a cheap radio, some knick-knacks, and a stamped single-shot .45
(like the Liberators we dropped on Occupied France during WWII) should
cost around $20. Double that for delivery costs. (That latter is pure
guess-work; I have no idea what an Air Force air-drop over hostile
territory would cost.) We'd be able to drop 25,000,000 of these for a
billion dollars. That's much less than the cost of even a small ground
operation, and would be one per person in Afghanistan. And plenty of
cheap but reliable pistols should let, say, a group of oppressed,
beaten, and starving women kill a Taliban patrol and take their assault
The consumer goods are just a finger in the eye for the reactionaries,
by the way. They're trying to keep the country in the 12th century, so
we should offend them by giving the people blue jeans, disposable
razors, science fiction paperbacks, anything we can to drive the Taliban
up the wall.

Not at all. I evidently didn't make my point clearly enough. What
follows will attempt to proceed from "second principles", since I don't
want to take the time to go from first principles.
Since prehistory, the only person who was able to go completely his own
way, without having to worry about what anyone else was doing, was the
totally self-sufficient man. (Woman, whatever.) If you don't need
anything from anyone, you don't need to care if the price changes on the
goods or services they want or are selling.
(This post is concerned only with mutually agreeable economic dealings.
Use of force, whether by government or by other bandits, changes the
As soon as you start trading, such as for metal tools to replace the
wood, stone, and bone you'd have to use otherwise, you have to be able
to provide something they want in order to get what you want. If you've
been trading an acre's yield of corn for a metal plow, but now your
blacksmith is able to get his corn cheaper by efficient trade with
someone farther away, you'd better drop your price, do without the plow,
or learn to make your own. Proceed with this argument and you can be
guaranteed of being able to grow your crops in your own way only if you
don't need anything from anyone else, a return to self-sufficiency.
The argument doesn't change just because the scale changes. If a ten
thousand acre corporate farm is able to produce grain more cheaply than
a hundred acre family farm, the family farmers' "rights" have not been
trampled just because they can't make their living as they did any
longer. They can't compete in the new environment, and they can change
their methods, attempt to become self-sufficient, or die.
Let me emphasize, I'm still talking about pure free market here. ADM has
a very effective lobbying machine, and gets handouts (gasahol) which
makes them more economically competitive than they naturally are.
Watch your assumptions. I've done plenty of farm work, all on family
farms, from planting and weeding by hand because the ground was too soft
for machines to shoveling cow shit. (And getting stepped on by the
malicious animals, but that only adds to the vindictive pleasure of
eating beef.) I much prefer computer consulting, thanks, and wouldn't
farm again unless my life depended on it.
Your theory about the ag schools and county agents and such may be
right; I don't know enough to comment on them.

Cases also have to be ejected. In principle, you can have a simpler

the only automatic caseless rifle I've seen (not an H&K) had a mechanism
virtually identical to any other gas operated automatice, down to the
ejector hook in case of a bad round.)
Right, petrol won't burn fast enough for direct propulsion. You might be
able to use a large combustion chamber and then neck down to get a
higher gas velocity, but (in the absense of actual calculations) I don't
think that would get you enough.
I suppose you could use something like space shuttle fuel; that burns
pretty fast. Of course, it's volatile, instable, corrosive, and
Gyrojet rounds burned out in, IIRC, 20 feet, and they covered that first
20 feet in a small fraction of a second. I don't think target dodging is
any more of an issue than with conventional bullets.
But the burning fuel might be a problem in another way: what if you
shoot someone who's less than 20 feet away? The rocket would keep
burning after it struck. Would that be viewed as torture, if you were
investigated for the shooting, be the shooting ever so justified? (Data
points: I've never pointed a pistol at anyone farther than about six
feet away. Once was under a foot. (Passenger in a small car tried to rob
me with a knife.) This is the norm for people who are actually shot with
pistols, as contrasted with being shot at.)

contiguous blob. They might well have been driving from one piece of the
base to another. More likely, they were practicing entering a civilian
city, which you can't do just on the base itself. Regardless, this kind
of thing goes on regularly, and generally without incident because the
military lets the civilian authorities know what's happening.
Maybe I'm reacting too strongly because I've been in similar training
myself, but I'd say whoever screwed up the Army-police coordination
should be charged with negligent homicide. If it was a military guy who
fucked up, that's certainly dereliction of duty. Probably other stuff,
too, but I'm no longer up on the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

@_subject: Re: When encryption is also authentication... 
Here's my analysis of the current situation regarding electronic
signatures in the United States. The following few paragraphs are the
way things are as I see them, not necessarily how they should be.
An e-signature in this situation would indicate assent to a contract.
One of the key points to forming a valid contract is a meeting of minds
between the parties. Another is authentication that the alleged
contracting party was actually the person who agreed to the contract.
Meeting of minds includes knowing, understanding, and agreeing to the
terms of the putative contract. With paper contracts, even lengthy ones,
knowledge and understanding are assumed if certain conventions are met,
such as font size and emphasis of important terms, as well as
opportunity to read the contract thoroughly. And the contracting party
is assumed to be able to take the contract to a lawyer if he's uncertain
about any part of it. Many electronic agreements fail on one or more of
these points. These contracts are often very lengthy, the equivalent of
several pages of printout, and are often viewed only through a very
small window, and often have small or otherwise illegible fonts. In
paper, this would be similar to a five-page contract being written out
on post-its, with only one visible at a time. Many of the agreements
cannot be printed out, which interferes with both reading and obtaining
expert advice. The situation is made even worse by the mingling of
technical jargon with the legal jargon; many software-related contracts
are even less intellegible than other contracts. Meeting of minds is
questionable under these circumstances.
Authentication is similarly problematic. Ordinary contracts are commonly
agreed to in person or with signatures. Electronic contracts are
commonly agreed to with one or two mouse clicks. There is nothing to
indicate that the "signer" was the person he alleged to be. Some laws
(see below) attempt to make this irrelevant, essentially saying that if
your computer agreed, you agreed, but this is unlikely to stand up in
court on basic principles.
I was unable to find any US case law (court cases which went to trial
and verdict, and which were written up for publication) on this subject.
Bear in mind that I no longer have access to Lexis or Westlaw, but
google and such can usually find relevent cases. I suspect that there
are no reported cases hinging on electronic signatures. This isn't
surprising, because the oldest electronic signature law is less than six
years old, and that's probably not enough time for a problem to have
arisen, been litigated, been appealed, and been written up.
The "e-sign" law of 2000 doesn't provide much help. It states simply
that a contract may not be denied solely because it was electronically
signed. Furthermore, it applies only to interstate and international
contracts. (Though most electronic contracts for, eg, downloaded
software will be interstate or international.) It doesn't provide
standards or guidance for what makes a valid electronic contract.
The Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) is a model law which
about half of the states have enacted. Some, maybe most, of these states
have modified UETA before passing it. It's not clear how this affects
contracts in which only one party is in a UETA state. UETA says that an
electronic record fulfills any requirements for a written contract
document and that an electronic signature fulfills any requirement for a
signature on the contract, and it outlines what constitutes an
electronic record and an electronic signature. Interestingly, UETA
states that an "agent", meaning a program, can fulfill the requirements
for a signature, even without human participation. See
for a decent summary, and  for more detail.
Summary: Recent laws have attempted to make electronic contracting
binding, but they have not addressed some of the fundamental principles
of contract law. These fundamental principles are often stretched or
broken in electronic contracting. There is no case law on electronic
contracts. I suspect that a contested electronic contract would be
easily voided.
OK, that's the way I think it is, currently in the US. The way I think
it _should_ be is much more caveat emptor, as Dr Mike and others have
said, but the legislators and judges have neglected to ask for my input.

I hope not. Addressing only the SS issue and not other USG debt, I'm attempting to organize a nation-wide grassroots movement. On a to-be-announced "F-day", every member of the movement will kill a designated old fart, one who has long since taken back out of SS anything s/he put into the system and is now subsisting solely on SS checks and other welfare. Bonus points for killing an old fart who has taken much more out of the system than he put in and yet was loudly agitating for an increase in benefits to help "the greatest generation, who gave so much for their country". Old farts who are still working or who are living on saved assets are exempt.
I'd prefer a system which simply cut off benefits once a person's own "contributions" had been exhausted (sort of like, you know, a personal retirement account) but that seems to be a non-option. (I'd _really_ prefer a system where each person was responsible for his own late-life well-being, but that kind of talk just gets you thrown in the loony bin these days.)

Another corollary of your statements is that we can't have an AI monitoring Joe User's system to maintain security. No matter how smart a consumer-grade AI is, you have to assume the attackers will have AIs at least as smart, and dedicated to tricking the defensive AIs. The same applies to human users, of course, but humans are more unpredicable than a security AI is likely to be, and can be held responsible if they're tricked; if the security AI is tricked, the vendor might be held liable.
Too bad; I've about come to the conclusion that Joe User is too dumb (ignorant, inattentive, careless; in a word, dumb) to secure his systems, and doesn't think it worth paying someone to do it for him. That's a bummer because no one is going to trust an electronic wallet on a machine which has a 50% chance of being 0wn3d any given month.

You don't know what you're talking about. This happened just a few miles from me, so perhaps I've paid closer attention than you have. T-shirt man wasn't merely minding his own business while wearing an offensive shirt. He was stepping in front of people and haranguing them in front of a large anchor store in the mall. After a while he was asked to leave by a store employee, so he took himself to the food court and repeated the procedure. After complaints from several mall patrons, a security guard asked T-shirt man to either knock it off or leave. T-shirt man refused, growing more and more aggressive, and eventually the local cops came along and arrested him. (I may have fudged some details, as I'm working from memory, but I don't think I screwed up anything important.)
OK, so far it could be the spontaneous actions of one guy. But, even though the story wasn't reported until the late news that evening, there was a large (hundreds, IIRC) crowd of protesters when the mall opened the next morning. This might not sound like much to someone used to NYC crowds, but by the standards of this area that was a huge crowd. I guess it _could_ have been a spontaneous rising of a populace fed up with jack-booted thug harrassment of dissenting opinion. But the more I hear about it, the more this sounds like a planned operation.

Incorrect. Trade secrets that are deliberately released by the owner are
no longer secret. Secrets that are carelessly released by the owner (eg,
wide-open path between their web server and their CVS repository) are
probably no longer secrets, but that's subject to finding of fact if it
goes to trial. Secrets that are stolen or illegally leaked are still
legally secrets. That's pretty clear, though things like developers
leaving a company and using their knowledge elsewhere can be
questionable. That's why most companies have non-disclosure forms for
you to sign when you start work.
Regarding case law cites, you can check google or findlaw as well as I.
Here, for the lazy or inept, is a useful page:
That, too. In the case of IBM's PC-BIOS that I mentioned before, IBM
relied on copyright rather than trade secret. (Obviously, given that
they released the source themselves.) Note, also, that that happened in
the days before rampant software patents. If the same were to happen
today, they'd almost certainly get a patent on their BIOS, and Compaq
wouldn't have been able to do their clean-room reimplementation.

Eric is correct in his reply to MV's article. Joe Programmer isn't
necessarily obligated not to look at leaked trade secrets, but if he
implements anything remotely related to the leaked secret, he and his
employers or customers are subject to being sued for using the secret.
In principle they can prove that the secret didn't have any influence on
the work, but in practice they're stuck having to prove a negative.
Eric is also correct about the "Chinese wall" between the people who
look at or figure out the secret and the implementation group. Back in
the early days of the IBM PC, IBM released the source to the BIOS,
figuring they could use copyright to keep anyone else from implementing
a compatible BIOS. Compaq did the Chinese wall trick, with one group
developing a rigorous spec from the released code, then throwing it over
the wall to the implementation group. If push came to shove, the
implementors could have sworn that they had never seen the IBM code.

If Sarath is, in fact, a student who will soon be looking for work, he
may do just fine. Getting a tech job has little to do with how much you
know or how well you can do the work. Most of getting a job, at least in
the US, has to do with putting together a resume that will get you a
call-back, and with impressing the HR guys during the first interview.
Neither of these need have any bearing on actual qualifications.
Once he has a job in the tech field, someone with people skills
sufficient to get others to do his work for him will get farther ahead
than the techie who actually does the work. Of course, it's easier for a
woman to pull this off in the typical tech-heavy company -- a woman just
has to chat with the guys, whereas a man will have to actively
brown-nose the bosses or ask favors of his co-workers.

No, pseudonymity lets others identify messages on, say c-punks, as
coming from a particular sender. Reputation can work here, even with no
meat-space identity attached. Anonymity means reputation can't work, so
each message has to be taken on its own, with no history to give clues
as to bias or reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to have to wade
through all the traffic, wondering which from Eugen and which from the
Australian-shithead-who-shall-not-be-named. Yah, it's easy enough to
tell once you've read the message, but I'd rather filter it out on the
"From:" level.
I realize that your, RAH's, "book" mostly deals with financial
transactions. In the very narrow domain of transactions which don't
require any trust, anonymity should be as useful as pseudonymity. In the
more general case, I'd think true anonymity would be a handicap. eg, I'm
certainly not going to send my hard-earned e-money to the account of

Response 1:
When the US sneezes, the world catches a cold.
Response 2:
The cpunks list isn't US-centric, but most of the regular posters are in
the US. Even if you don't count Bob Hettinga because he mostly forwards
news articles rather than write original content, and don't count Tyler
Durden and me because we're idiots, I think you still have mostly
Americans posting.

It's been a while since I was in the US Army, but I'm sure that the life
insurance we had didn't cover parachute-related deaths and I vaguely
recall it didn't cover combat deaths. Kinda serious omissions, from the
soldier's point of view.

But, but, but ... This is *government approved* metal foil. It's the

they're here to help.
On your broader point, yah. I'll check out /. once in a while for
pointers to news items and more rarely for the "ask slashdot" items, but
most of the comments are garbage and probably half of the posts are
garbage. The question is, has /. gotten worse since it was fresh, or
have I grown less tolerant of ill-informed, shoot-off-at-the-mouth
kiddies? (I have a 4-digit slashdot user id, to show how long ago I came
across them.)

Heh. When the stasi come a-callin' tell them they'll have to wait
because you've got bigger problems. Wonder how well that would work?
I see that an irrevocable payment system, used by itself, is ripe for
fraud, more so if it's anonymous. But why wouldn't a mature system make
use of trusted intermediaries? The vendors register with the intermedi-
ary *, who takes some pains to verify their identity, trustworthiness,
and so on, and to keep the vendors' identities a secret, if appropriate.
The sellers pay the intermediary, who takes a piece of the action to act
basically as an insurer of the vendor's good faith. If there's a problem
with the service or merchandise and the vendor won't make good, the
intermediary is responsible for making the buyer whole. Is there some
reason this wouldn't work? If not, why hasn't anyone tried it yet? Not
enough cash flow to make it worth their while?
* There's a proper word for "trusted intermediaries" in this context,
but hanged if I can remember it.

Much evidence to the contrary. My life is sucking pretty bad lately, due
to either a long series of fairly unlikely and uniformly unpleasant
coincidences or else the machinations of a malevolent universe set up
specifically to piss me off. Another possibility is that suggested by
the other RAH, the cosmology which presents all of us as mere characters
in the stories told by Authors, the multifarious and nefarious gods.

I tried, years before _UC_ came out, to get some friends to name their

I also tried to get my wife to agree to a heroic name for our son. In
the tradition of Pericles and Sophocles, I present ... Testicles.
No, she didn't go for it.

My complaints about Tim's anarchistic writings were about his desire to
watch DC detonate, or to watch a rampage against useless eaters of one
type or another, or the like. However, unless there were a mass uprising
against the current government, or the idea of any government, any
limited demonstration would simply be an excuse for the ratchet to turn
another few clicks. Viz the OKC bombing.
As for anonymous bearer transactions in an anarchy, I'm going to have to
bag on that for now. Not cowardice -- work to do. Later, if I remember,
which I won't because I'm a burnout.

All we need is a Bayesian Maysian filter to separate the wheat from the
(racist | deranged | anarchist | readthearchives) chaff.
On a related note, is it possible that Tim has syphillis and it went to
his brain? His earlier work was certainly insightful, well thought-out,
and useful. His later writings, generally useless and irritating though
they were, still had occasional relevance. Poor Tim, sharing Nietzsche's
