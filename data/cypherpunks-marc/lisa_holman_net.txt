@_subject: Reputable E-Gold Funded Debit Cards? 
Does anyone on the list have recommendations for a provider of E-Gold
funded debit cards?
With all of the ponzi schemes going on its hard to know who to trust.
Interestingly, in my search of Google groups I only found spam messages
for various offshore outfits that sound like they may be running some kind
of ponzi scheme.
I'm very interested to hear about any company that is reputable.

I didn't suggest that they should be banned.  I simply stated that this was one consumer usage of the smart card reader.
