Q Y No thanks:  One summer evening, during a violent thunderstorm, a mother was tucking her
small boy into bed. She was about to turn off the light when he asked¡¡with
a tremor in his voice, "Mommy, will you sleep with me tonight?"¡¡The mother
smiled and gave him a reassuring hug. "I can't dear," she said, "I have to
sleep with Daddy."A long silence was broken at last by a shaken little voice
saying, "The big sissy."
A young executive was leaving the office of a major corporation late one
evening when he found the CEO himself standing in front of a shredder with a
piece of paper in his hand. Eager to make a good impression, the young exec
introduced himself and asked if he could be of any help. "Why yes," said the
CEO, holding up the piece of paper. "This is a very sensitive and important
document, and my secretary has gone for the night. Can you make this thing
work?" "Certainly," said the young executive, happy for a chance to help the
boss. The young man turned the machine on, inserted the paper, and pressed
the start button. "Excellent, excellent!" said the CEO as his paper
disappeared inside the machine. "I'll need two copies." roubasin3somuke06sugeseng,susaki busyuugi.
