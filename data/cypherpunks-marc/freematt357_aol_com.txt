'Wired': The Coolest Magazine on the Planet
By DAVID CARR
Wired magazine, that storied artifact of a digital age, was conceived by its editors as a ''a reverse time capsule. It would sail back through time and land at people's feet.'' And so it has, most recently in the form of ''Wired: A Romance,'' a book by one of the magazine's contributing editors, Gary Wolf. Our notions of the future have a tendency to age quickly, and Wired, a magazine that served as both Boswell and bomb thrower for the geekerati in the 1990's, seems to have aged more quickly than most. The seminal publication, Wolf writes, was created in the midst of a digital revolution that its high priest, Louis Rossetto, liked to refer to as a ''Bengali typhoon.'' By the time Rossetto and Wired's co-founder, Jane Metcalfe, were thrown clear, everything had changed, but not in the ways that they once thought it would. Wired was important not just because it was the first magazine to make the computer world seem hip; it also trained its eye on the implications of the onrushing new technology, not merely on appraising the newest machines and trendiest gadgets. (Though Wired featured plenty of articles about those things, too.) The magazine, Rossetto promised somewhat grandiosely early on, would foment ''a revolution without violence that embraces a new, nonpolitical way to improve the future based on economics beyond macro control, consensus beyond the ballot box, civics beyond government and communities beyond the confines of time and geography.'' Rossetto's manifesto seems quaint just 10 years later, but it found many disciples. Gary Wolf, an early Wired employee, was among them, and he has written a deceptively deadpan recollection that reads more like a libretto than a straightforward work of journalism. Wolf expertly traces the magazine's heavily hyped ascendancy, though, sadly, most readers will know all along that the magazine Rossetto saw as a Trojan horse for revolution was eventually sold in 1998 to a corporation (Conde Nast) like any common asset. (The magazine still exists, though it doesn't carry the swagger and prestige it once did.) Wolf writes with a former true believer's skepticism, a wan idealism rubbed out by subsequent events. As his book's title suggests, Wolf is still a bit wistful about Wired's careering journey through the 90's. It's hard to blame him. The corporate-dominated magazine industry tends to stay safely behind significant issues, while Wired was that odd indie publication that actually enabled a movement by appealing to its nobler instincts. But as Wolf demonstrates, Wired's purity of purpose -- Rossetto seemed to care about money only as oxygen for his dream -- did not inoculate the magazine from the ambient greed that reduced a hoped-for paradigm shift to a pile of failed I.P.O.'s. ''Wired: A Romance'' is less a love story than a theological autopsy of a religion that flourished and went away in less than a decade. Things happened quickly for Wired -- remember ''Internet time''? At its height in the mid-90's, Wired could be found in the lobbies of venture capitalists, on the light tables of designers, underneath the coffee cups of computer geeks and in the middle of the only conversation that seemed to matter. It was, briefly, the coolest magazine on the planet. This book is fundamentally a biography of Rossetto, a larger-than-life personality whom Wolf compares to ''a magnet whose grip increased dramatically at close range.'' In retrospect, it would be easy to mistake Rossetto for another would-be Internet guru and Wired as a curio of a bygone time, but as Wolf makes clear, the revolution that Rossetto championed was not about the Web. Rossetto saw desktop publishing as a profound reinvention of the printing press. ''He thought computer publishing would change the world,'' Wolf writes. And Rossetto knew a thing or two about revolution. As Wolf points out, Rossetto, a former anarchist who obtained a master's degree in business administration from Columbia, was a global itinerant, a gaunt, hippie-ish Zelig who just happened to be in the neighborhood when the Shining Path emerged in Peru, when the Tamil rebellion began in Sri Lanka, when the Red Brigades sowed chaos in Italy. Small wonder Rossetto ended up in San Francisco in the early 90's with Jane Metcalfe, then his girlfriend, on the cusp of another kind of insurgency, both of them working to finance a new kind of magazine. Rossetto wanted to call their journal DigIt -- as in either ''digit'' or ''dig it'' -- a bad idea that Metcalfe mercifully talked him out of. The new magazine would be named Wired. With the help of $20,000 from a sympathetic Dutch entrepreneur, the pair managed to get inexpensive access to a Canon color copier -- an exotic technology at the time -- to produce a prototype. Several of Wired's more durable angels, investors with real money who bought Rossetto's conceits, signed on later. And John Plunkett, the man responsible for Wired's neon-suffused, anarchic design, committed to joining the magazine in spite of himself. This glossy fever dream of a magazine made its debut at the Macworld conference on Jan. 2, 1993. The early adopters snatched it up and Wired was on its way. But Wolf demonstrates that Rossetto always seemed to keep his ambitions just ahead of his funding. Chunks of the enterprise were handed out to investors so that Wired could expand to the Web, to television, to Europe and beyond. The magazine's Web site, HotWired, turned out to be a particularly effective way of making money disappear. Wolf, who became HotWired's executive editor in 1995, appears in the narrative at this point, saying that after meetings with Rossetto he left his boss's office with ''the light step of a person who has been given permission to be bad.'' But Wolf's efforts to enrich his writer friends with lucrative freelance assignment for the Web site comes off as a misdemeanor in felonious times. The pressure to move Wired toward an initial public offering drove an ill-advised effort for bigness at all costs. No one cared about profits, and deals were made willy-nilly to build the hypothetical value of the company, including adding a search engine, the gewgaw of the moment. The pranksters at Suck, a sardonic (and now defunct) site built by Wired employees on the sly, captured the era's ethos with carnal clarity. In an essay written at the very beginning of the Web boom, Wolf writes, ''The Sucksters' advice was to fluff up a site, locate a rich, stupid buyer and then run away fast before the concoction deflated.'' To his credit, Rossetto never saw how giving away content free on the Web could make anyone rich. Wolf describes -- in too much detail, because he happened to be in the middle of it -- how Rossetto fought to make visitors to HotWired register, which some believed violated the Web's ethos. By this time, bankers and shareholders were looking over his shoulder, accusing him of being a profligate Luddite at a revolution he once led. While charting the Nasdaq's rise and eventual fall, Wolf shows Rossetto and Metcalfe readying Wired for a ''liquidity event,'' that supremely validating 90's moment. But when they hit the road in October 1996 to pitch investors, Rossetto's overweening ambitions and the market's gyrations left Wired's public offering dead on arrival. Rossetto become so preoccupied with saving the business that he eventually handed leadership of the magazine over to Katrina Heron, a former editor at Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. Heron, who is now a consultant for The New York Times, proved to be an able and popular steward of the magazine, but in stepping aside Rossetto had built his own gallows. The money men who had attached themselves to Wired set up a series of impossible financial targets for Rossetto, and in March 1998 he and Metcalfe were cast out of the future they had built. The magazine was eventually sold to Conde Nast, and its two founders ended up with $30 million and a profoundly bad taste in their mouths. Wolf allows Andrew Anker, the ferociously ambitious C.E.O. of the company, to serve up an epitaph for the ideals that once drove Wired. With the sale of the magazine on the table, Wolf recounts how Anker and other senior Wired employees went to a bar in San Francisco for an impromtu wake. Anker gleefully tallies up his substantial gains to the outrage of his less fortunate colleagues. ''What is this, 'Sesame Street'?'' Anker said. ''Every man for himself means every man for himself!'' The future, it turned out, would still be written by Charles Darwin in spite of Wired's best efforts. David Carr is a media reporter for The Times.

About SERVE
Federal Voting Assistance Program
The Secure Electronic Registration and Voting Experiment, or SERVE, is a
project aimed at providing Uniformed Services members and overseas citizens
ability to register, vote and check their status throughout the absentee
process. We want you to be able to exercise your democratic right in a safe,
convenient, reliable and timely manner, by bringing the voting booth to you
through the Internet.
We have taken all by-mail absentee election functions, and placed them on the
Internet. Anyone with a Windows-based computer and an Internet browser will
be able to vote without worrying if your ballot will arrive on time. You will
even be able to check the status of your registration, your ballot request and
see if your vote was counted.
SERVE will let you:
Register to vote
Check the status of your registration, your ballot availability, and your
voted ballot
Request your absentee ballot
The following states have expressed a strong interest in participating in
SERVE. Since legislation will be required in several of these, this list is
final. In addition, most states will be identifying selected counties for
participation. Check back periodically to find out if your state and county
are in
SERVE. This list is expected to be final by the end of July.

DOD STARTS SECURE INTERNET REGISTRATION AND VOTING
DEMONSTRATION FOR 2004 ELECTION
The Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP), in conjunction with several
states and counties, has begun conducting a large Internet registration and
voting demonstration for the 2004 election. This Congressionally mandated
is called SERVE, which stands for Secure Electronic Registration and Voting
Thousands of absentee uniformed services personnel, their dependents, and
overseas U.S. citizens will have the opportunity to register to vote and cast
their ballots from any Windows-based computer with Internet access, anywhere
the world. County election officials will use the SERVE system to receive
registration applications, provide ballots to voters, and accept voted
ballots. These officials will use their existing election administration
systems to
process registrations and ballots.
bSecurity is everyonebs first question about Internet voting, so we made
security the driving factor in the SERVE system design,b said FVAP Director
Brunelli. bWe are working closely with state and local election officials to
ensure that the integrity of the electoral process is maintained.b States
currently expected to participate in SERVE are Arkansas, Florida, Hawaii,
Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah and
The SERVE project is the latest in a series of technology initiatives
undertaken by FVAP as part of its mission to improve access to the polls for
uniformed services personnel and overseasAmerican citizens. A small-scale
proof of
concept pilot, Voting Over the Internet, was successfully conducted for the
election. In that experiment, 84 citizens located in 21 states and 11
countries returned ballots to jurisdictions in Florida, South Carolina, Texas
Utah. This was the first time that binding votes were cast over the Internet
federal, state and local offices. The new SERVE system will build on the
knowledge and experience FVAP gained in this groundbreaking and highly

While I do think that the Fbi and Secret Service could be closed and their tasks combined and given over to the NSA ,Marines and other law enforcement agencies, I think that overall the agencies did the best they could.
This is utter bullshit. The US knew that Bin Laden was a threat and had been conducting covert operations with NSA against him for some number of years prior to 9/11. NSA was erasing the various bank databases that Bin Laden's funds were in and they were messing around with his wire transfers. Hell, Intel was even playing taped conversations of Bin Laden with his mother to impress Congress all prior to 9/11.
Bin Laden choose the WTC as a symbol of American financial imperialism and as a punishment to our screwing with him...The failure IMHO is that rather than in engaging in largely harassing techniques-We should have gone after him in much as the same fashion as we are today-It isn't like we didn't have ample What I'm saying for the hearing impaired is that our Intel agencies made the threat worse by playing games that enraged the attacker (Bin Laden) rather than neutralizing the threat.

THE LIGHTHOUSE, the weekly e-mail newsletter of The Independent Institute, the non-politicized public-policy research organization.  "Enlightening Ideas for Public Policy..."
Excerpted via :Vol. 5, Issue 31, August 4, 2003
PENTAGON SCRAPS INFORMATION MARKET
Even those who understandably scorned the Pentagon's recently cancelled Policy Analysis Market (PAM) -- a.k.a. the terrorism futures market, as some detractors called it -- should admit that it was innovative in a badly needed way.
In proposing a virtual market to help predict contingencies in the Middle East and elsewhere, PAM set out to achieve what years of pseudo-reform of U.S. military and intelligence agencies had failed even to attempt -- to bypass the hierarchical bureaucracy that has led to numerous deadly intelligence failures.
By making use of the knowledge of thousands of people willing to put their money on the line (maximum bet: $100), PAM was based on the insight that markets, driven by economic actors with powerful incentives to guess correctly, often know better than a handful of professional prognosticators. This point has been well illustrated by the web-based Iowa Political Stock Market, a virtual market that has consistently predicted election outcomes more accurately than Because PAM was controversial for more than one reason, it should not be surprising that it was misrepresented by politicians and the media.
"Contrary to impressions in the media, the primary purpose of the PAM was not to predict individual events of terrorism but rather to predict inputs into terrorism such as the economic growth rates of countries in the Middle East, political instability, and military activity," write Alexander Tabarrok, research director of the Independent Institute, and Robin Hanson, the principal architect of the Policy Analysis Market, in a new op-ed.
Rather, write Tabarrok and Hanson, PAM was to help answer such questions as "What would happen to unrest in the Middle East if the US withdrew its troops in Saudi Arabia" and "How would Jordan fare politically if the 'roadmap' were successfully implemented?"
Recent history suggests that traditional approaches to such questions, even if well-informed, can become ignored or politicized.
"The yes-man phenomena means that information doesn't rise from the field to the decision-makers," write Tabarrok and Hanson. "And sometimes the bosses don't want to hear what the field has to say. Remember the CIA and FBI analysts who repeatedly tried to signal their worries about terrorism to their superiors but were rebuffed? In contrast, a PAM would produce a public and easily understood number that would be difficult to ignore."
Fortunately, the future of such "information markets," "prediction aggregators," or "idea futures" doesn't rest on government funding and would be managed better without it. A few visionary institutions, such as Hewlett-Packard, have already used them to aid in decision-making, and many more will be adopted. But as with so many innovations, don't expect the government to employ them effectively for a long, long time.

Para-Ordinace is a gun manufactor from Ontario.  While in Toronto I read that some employees from Para were caught selling gun parts to whoever wanted them-  It appears that gun control doesn't work for them either.
You can travel to Canada with a rifle, you just have to declare it along with the serial number which they record and where you're going to hunt or camp or whatnot.  Regards,  Matt-

Personally I won't fly either, as I want to be treated as a customer and I refuse to be treated as a suspect.   As a suspect the airlines can eat my seat.
However, I refuse to be hog-tied so I travel around the US on the ground-  I've encountered two travel concerns- One on I-10 outside of El Paso at a border patrol checkpoint- The Border Patrolman wanted to know where I had been and where I was going and what I had been doing...In short, intrusive none of their business questions.  That time I was traveling from Phoenix to the French Quarter of New Orleans- The Fed wanted to know why I was using the southern route, so I said why not? At the time they were searching some hapless teenage boy's pickup so they waved me through.  Interestingly I visited Mexico that trip and when I reentered the US I didn't even have to show ID.  The guys at Customs and Immigration just waved me through after asking me where I'm from, albeit I look American.
The other was at a Canadian border crossing on my way to Montreal.  The Maple leafers have a database of American gun owners, as the customs guy asked me "You have a pistol?" to which I replied no. He asked again not believing me "You don't have a pistol???" Upon which I replied that is correct I don't have a pistol, I have pistols plural.  My buddy traveling with me announced in a loud voice so the entire station could hear, of course we have pistols, and rifles too-  That's what free people have and that's one of the reason's I'd never move to Canada.

I spent considerable effort cleaning my car of any stray ammo, thinking what sort of post 9/11 hell I'd me in if they found a .308 or errant 9 mm. Speaking with Canadian customs however I discovered that I could have legally imported 5,000 rounds of ammo.  Apparently people do so for hunting trips.

Author James Bovard will appear on C-SPAN 's Booknotes with Brian Lamb this Sunday, 11/02, from 8 pm to 9 pm (I believe it may re-air from 11 pm to midnight).  Bovard will be discussing his new book "Terrorism and Tyranny: Trampling Freedom, Justice, and Peace to Rid the World of Evil".  I've read the book and recommend it highly.  For program notes go to:
For additional information on the works of James Bovard please go to:
 bfrom the publisher's website
"The war on terrorism is the first political growth industry of the new Millennium." So begins Jim Bovard's newest and, in some ways, most provocative book as he casts yet another jaundiced eye on Washington and the motives behind protecting "the homeland" and prosecuting a wildly unpopular war with Iraq. For James Bovard, as always, it all comes down to a trampling of personal liberty and an end to privacy as we know it. From airport security follies that protect no one to increased surveillance of individuals and skyrocketing numbers of detainees, the war on terrorism is taking a toll on individual liberty and no one tells the whole grisly story better than Bovard.

Outside the Rule of Law

While it might be an amusing tag line typical of the most noxious character

abysmal treatment of designated enemy combatants.
News of the American prisonerbs counsel came one day before the Justice

nowhere is the

@_subject: IRT's Hunter arrested for CCW in Ohio 
Yesterday I was contacted by Don Lobo and was asked if I could assist Liberty Round Table's Hunter, who had been arrested for carrying a concealed weapon by The Ohio State Highway Patrol.  Hunter had been in route to share the holidays with friends and family and was simply transversing the Buckeye State when he was stopped for speeding near Ashland, OH (80 miles north of Columbus).
Without revealing too much of the particulars, at some point during the traffic stop the patrol yanked him out of his truck and searched him, found two pistols on his person, several knives, a FAL with a thousand rounds locked in the back and several swords.  Ohio doesn't have a CCW permit system and such offenses are felonies.  He was arrested on Monday and was able to bail out yesterday (New Year's Eve). However the patrol has obtained a search warrant for his vehicle and will not release it until perhaps Monday at the earliest. I left my bunker compound in Columbus, grabbed a friend  and found Hunter in Ashland. I met with his attorney who attempted to allow Hunter to gain access to his personal effects from his impounded vehicle. The head of the Ashland Post of the Highway Patrol would not let him retrieve anything from his vehicle.  This included a change of underwear, Christmas gifts for his mother and family, clean socks, his PGP encrypted laptop and even his toothbrush.  This was quite unreasonable after spending two days in jail, having no vehicle, no clean clothes, and on New Year's Eve to boot.
His lawyer thought this unreasonable move was due to the unsolved sniper cases in Columbus, his lawyer is trying to find out what the warrant is for etc. Speculation is that they want to test the guns ballistically.
I took Hunter out to dinner for a steak and then to Walmart for some fresh underwear and T-shirts.
Hunter is in good spirits and vows to fight this.  He will be incommunicado for a few days. He had a hotel room and Don Lobo was scheduled to arrive in the early am this morning to pick him up.
More details will follow.
