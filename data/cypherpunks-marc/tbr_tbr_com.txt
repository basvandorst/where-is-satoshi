Should be amusing wordplay to see Bush deal with this...
     Israel, incensed at Wednesday's assassination of right-wing cabinet
minister and former
      general Rehavam Zeevi, threatened to invoke the war on terrorism
to justify attacking the
      Palestinians if they fail to hand over Zeevi's killers.
Lets repeat our training:
    I fight for freedom
    You are a guerilla
    They are terrorists
And don't plan on vacationing in Indonesia for a while...

The Computer Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC) - whose motto is
"Keeping DOE Secure"
  - this week issued a bulletin warning privacy- conscious users that
  Internet-connected bug-reporting capabilities of Windows XP or Office
in combination
  with recent versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser could
disclose sensitive data
  to Microsoft.
  However, it described the vulnerability as a
  "medium/low" risk.
  The issue, CIAC wrote in its bulletin, is that
  the Windows Error Reporting feature takes
  a snapshot of data stored in memory at the
  time of an application failure - data that
  could include content from a document
  being edited at the time of a crash.

Reporters Without Borders Attacks U.S. Pact on Satellite Images

PARIS (AP) - A media advocacy group on Thursday criticized the U.S.
military for buying exclusive rights to commercial satellite imagery of
Afghanistan and said the move amounts to censorship because it blocks
media access to views of the war zone.
Paris-based Reporters Without Borders urged Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld to revoke a deal that gives the U.S. military sole access to
pictures taken by Ikonos - considered the most efficient civilian
satellite - that display the area involved in Operation Enduring
The Pentagon duty officer could not immediately be reached for comment
Thursday night.
"This contract, effective since the first day of U.S. military strikes
on Afghanistan, is a way of disguised censorship aimed at preventing the
media from doing their monitoring job," Reporters Without Borders
director Robert Menard said in a statement.
Though there are other imagery satellites with pictures for sale, Ikonos
pictures are considered the best available to civilians.

Anti-Gay Bomb Slur Wrong, Navy Says
WASHINGTON (AP) - An anti-gay slur written on one of the bombs used in
the strikes on Afghanistan was inappropriate
and commanders have been directed to prevent similar incidents, a top
Navy official said.
Pilots or crews of U.S. warplanes often write messages on bombs, either
taunting the enemy or praising America. Messages
written on bombs during the anti-terrorism airstrikes have included
several references to the Sept. 11 attacks.
A news photograph of a plane on the USS Enterprise aircraft carrier last
week showed one bomb with the message, ``High
Jack This,'' followed by an anti-gay slur.
The Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, complained about the
bomb's message. Rear Adm. Stephen Pietropaoli, in a
letter to the group Wednesday, said the Navy does not tolerate
discrimination and the bomb's message was an ``isolated
Several newspapers across the country also asked the Navy about the
bomb's message earlier this week, said Pietropaoli, the
Navy's chief of information.
``We immediately notified Navy commanders involved with Operation
Enduring Freedom to ensure steps were taken to
prevent a recurrence of this unfortunate incident. They have done so,''
Pietropaoli wrote.
Elizabeth Birch, executive director of Human Rights Campaign, said in a
statement that the letter was ``a welcome clarification
and we are pleased the Navy has stated that this type of anti-gay
behavior has no place in our armed forces.''
