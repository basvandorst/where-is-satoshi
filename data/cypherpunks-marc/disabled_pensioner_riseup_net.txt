@_subject: Re: [tor-talk] VOIP and tor 
This all sounds too complicated for me!
Is there any VoIP service that can be used with Tor (or JAP) running
under Linux that is easily set up and has helpful manual pages.
To be clear: I want a service without cost, but if that is not
possible, could anyone suggest a low-cost service in the UK?
I'd really like to use VoIP to contact friends and family, but
(preferably) I want one that resides on my computer and is without
cost, but low-cost is a possibility.
