I found your website in the google search engine and I see you link several sites similar to ours and I was wondering if you'd be interested in a link exchange with our site  , We have a Google Rank PR of 5 which is pretty good and have quite a steady flow of traffic, you can copy the link code html from (  ) or I included it below, once you add it just let us know and we'll link back immediately. We can link back immediately upon recieving your reply and your site's link code html.
 - Free Games -  Arcade games, checkers, solitaires, trivia, sweepstakes, casinos. Something for everyone from novices to pros.
I'd also like to ask if you'd be interested in adding 4,180+ free games to a new page or something on your site, maybe a small arcade branch. All you do is copy the HTML code from the pages we allow (  ) and put your LAYOUT around it and upload it to your server. After that, you just link it from your other pages and the games arcade is on YOUR WEB DOMAIN and it links DIRECTLY to all 4,180+ free online games. The games are legally hosted by us and you don't have to worry about ANY fees or ANY bandwidth issues since we host them. If you have ANY questions at all, please feel free to ask, no such thing as a stupid question. I'd love to link exchange with ANY and ALL sites that you can with, the more the merrier~! Thank You,
Andrew Merkinson
