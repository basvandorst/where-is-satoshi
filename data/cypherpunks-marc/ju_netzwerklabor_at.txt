Technically you are right. But then: what is the difference to ISPs?
They offer routing- and DNS- and mail- and other services on
various infrastructure.

actually it is not a "similar case" but the case of William W. that
BBC reported. Though with some mistakes: the servers were not seized,
the hardware (drives etc) at his home was seized, William was not
charged (he says), police is just investigating.
And so far only the police know if "images showing child sex abuse"
were actually "found passing through them" as BBC writes.
The warrent posted at arstechnica.net
mentions section 207a, para 2, 2nd case, and para 4 no 2, lit b of
Austrian Criminal Code, which would be possession of a a pornographic
depiction of a minor person over 14, showing their genitals in an
obscene manner. (the text of the relevant section in German:
The warrent does not mention anything that refers to distribution or
transport of pornographic images. So, either police and judge were not
aware that it was a TOR server or they have/had a suspicion
that's not related to running a TOR server. Or the made a
mistake and quoted the wrong section. We simply don't know at present.

The info from tor-talk was somewhat misleading. William Weber is not
the owner of the ISP. He works there as an administrator. So he runs
it (maybe) technically, not economically.
See eg:
where his boss "ExPl0ReR" weighs in.
And "large" is quite relative. This info says they have 13 employees. It may be outdated though.
