Now CHEXpedite Electronic Check Recovery
Recovers Your Money.. Fast! And Free!
Take A Look At The CHEXpedite Advantages:
 * Check Collection is Free!
 * When the funds are collected and released, you receive 100% face value of the check paid twice monthly
 * No minimum or maximum number of checks or dollar amounts
 * No special equipment required
  * No long-term contracts
 * All collected checks are paid to you twice monthly
 * Collections processed on ANY bank in the US Federal Reserve System
 * Out-of-town checks are handled just as easily as local checks
 * CHEXpedite Electronic Check Recovery is available to any business
anywhere that takes checks.
With CHEXpedite Electronic Check Recovery, whenever you have
a bounced check, we can bypass conventional methods by converting it to an electronic item.
We do this using a very unique proprietary software program which electronically transmits the item to the Automated Clearing House (ACH) like an email.  Electronic items always take priority
over paper checks, so your checks get priority.
This is an automated electronic process that deducts the money
from the check bouncer's account.  The recovered funds are paid
to you twice a month.  This completely eliminates the annoying
30-60 day process of most collection agencies, if you ever see
the money at all!  Best of all, the collection is absolutely Free
to you.
