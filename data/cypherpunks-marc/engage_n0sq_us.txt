It was a Mandrake key for a Mandrake package that I was having trouble
with. The RPMS from eslrah installed OK but I'm wondering if those PLF
packages will break something.

Why is it that some of the package updates are missing GPG signatures?
And, yes, I did check to see if the "missing" key was in the rpm PubKeys
database. I even tried re-creating the rpm PubKey database.
