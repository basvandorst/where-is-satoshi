Andy, maybe you or someone else has some insight into something I've
wondered about:
Is there a secure way to timeshare a single entropy source such as an
entropy key? High-quality entropy sources are often fragile, expensive, or
difficult to manufacture and maintain. If Alice has a friggin' amazing
entropy source, and Bob wants to use it from afar, what would be the best
way for Alice to let Bob retrieve data from the entropy source when she
wasn't using it?

There's even an HTTPS Everywhere rule for it already in case you *only*
want to ever access it over SSL! (only in the development branch right now, should be released soon)
