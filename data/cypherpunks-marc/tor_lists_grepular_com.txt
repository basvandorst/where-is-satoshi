Really? In which one of the following lists does Sorbs list Tor servers?
And in what way does the description mislead the user as to the purpose
of the listing?
 1.) http.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 2.) socks.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 3.) misc.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 4.) smtp.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 5.) web.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 6.) new.spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 7.) recent.spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 8.) old.spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net
 9.) spam.dnsbl.sorbs.net
10.) escalations.dnsbl.sorbs.net
11.) block.dnsbl.sorbs.net
12.) zombie.dnsbl.sorbs.net
13.) dul.dnsbl.sorbs.net
They each have very specific listing criteria, but none of them specify
"Tor exit node"...

Sorbs have *many* different lists. They do not just list sources of spam,
and nor do they claim to. See If someone ignorantly decides to start blocking mail or http requests
based on an IP being listed on the aggregate of all sorbs zones, ie
dnsbl.sorbs.net then it is they who are at fault, not Sorbs. Sorbs does
not tell you what to do with their lists.
http.dnsbl.sorbs.net  - List of Open HTTP Proxy Servers.
socks.dnsbl.sorbs.net - List of Open SOCKS Proxy Servers.
misc.dnsbl.sorbs.net  - List of open Proxy Servers not
                        listed in the SOCKS or HTTP lists.
So... If you're listed in http.dnsbl.sorbs.net, sorbs are saying,
"Last time we checked. There's an open HTTP proxy at IP x. Do
what you want with this free information". What they're *not*
saying is "Block IP x or you'll get hacked and spammed!!!"
So there are three main possibilities as far as E-Golds actions go as far
as I can see.
1.) They're ignorantly blocking Tor users without realising.
2.) They're blocking them on purpose because the collatoral damage is
    worth it to protect their other customers.
3.) They're ignorantly blocking Tor users without realising, but if they
    knew about Tor they'd do it on purpose anyway to protect their service
    and customers.
Sorbs are not doing anything evil, or scamming anyone. They are publicly
expressing their opinion and observations of behaviour from IP
addresses, and letting people do what they want to with that
The only solution to this problem is to contact E-Gold and try to get
them to whitelist TOR exit nodes, perhaps using
ip-port.torhosts.nighteffect.us. They might say yes, they might so no,
or they might ignore you. You're free to take your business elsewhere of

Alternatively, if you've got an Apache reverse proxy in front of your DirPort as described in the manual, you could perhaps implement per IP, connection and bandwidth rate limiting with mod_cband. Just a thought.

@_subject: Re: [tor-talk] Tor and P2P (Hidden SMS) 
Hash: SHA512
I've had an idea for a while for a killer service for Orbot, but
haven't begun to start implementing it yet. I use an application
called TextSecure to send encrypted SMS. It hides the message that I'm
sending, but it doesn't hide who I'm talking to and when, which is
just as important.
If Orbot on my phone and my friends phone were both running hidden
services. Then they could both make a "direct" connection to each
other, and transmit SMS/BBM/Kik/WhatsApp style messages directly over
the Tor network between phones. The messages would automatically be
encrypted and the fact that either of us are even sending or receiving
messages, let alone who with, would be hidden.
This is not the same as using XMPP over Tor. XMPP requires a trusted
third party server to handle the relaying. This is P2P direct
communication using hidden services. It's not real-time IM chat. It's
SMS style chat (with acceptable delays), and the simplicity of the
user interface should reflect this. It would look very similar to the
native SMS app.
When one phone connects to another, it "knows" that the device it's
connecting to is running the hidden service that it is trying to send
a message to. However, the other phone, (the one running the hidden
service), has no idea who is connecting to it. So I think it would be
a good idea when sending a message that the phone connects to a hidden
service and says, "Hi. There's a message waiting for you at
xxxxx.onion. You can retrieve it using this long unique random code:
yyy". And then the recipient phone connects back to that onion address
to retrieve the message, supplying the unique code. That way, both
phones know the onion address of the person they're talking to.
Alternatively (this would be faster), in the original connection, it
could send the actual SMS content along with the "confirmation code",
and the message could appear to the recipient as "Unconfirmed Sender"
until the recipient phone successfully connects back to the sender
onion address to confirm that it sent it.
It could even allow multiple identities, with a different onion
address for each one.
Basically, it would provide encrypted, hidden, "SMS". In many
countries, the police can obtain information about who is SMS'ing who
without a warrant, they just need a warrant to view the content of
those messages. This would solve that problem.
Ideally, it would also use encryption to store the messages on the
phone side in case the phone is compromised. TextSecure uses EC public
key crypto for this. It takes incoming messages that aren't encrypted,
and encrypts them with the public key. You then use your private key
to decrypt them later. I believe the Guardian Project created a
library for encrypted sqlite databases which could come in handy there

Since the GSM f/w controls a radio, and thus the power, it may need a
FCC certification.  In which case you would need someone to finance
the certification every time a new version of the Gnu firmware is
released (FSF perhaps?).
