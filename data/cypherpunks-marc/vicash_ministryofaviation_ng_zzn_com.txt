DEAR SIR,
IT IS MY PLEASURE TO CONTACT YOU REQUESTING FOR YOUR BANK ACCOUNT WHERE WE COULD MAKE A FUND TRANSFER OF TWENTY-THREE MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$23,800,000.00) FROM MY MINISTRY'S BANK ACCOUNT FOR OUR PERSONAL USE. THIS REQUEST
INVOLVES THREE OTHERS AND I.
I  WORK FOR THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION, ABUJA, NIGERIA AND MY POSITION IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE. TWO OF THE DIRECTORS IN THIS SPECIAL REQUEST WILL GO ON RETIREMENT IN JUNE 2002 AND FOR THIS REASON, WE HAVE INCLUDED THE ABOVE SUM TO THE BULK SUM APPROVED TO BE PAID TO OUR SUNDRY CONTRACTORS WHOSE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND COMMISSIONED.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS SUM EMANATED FROM A PROJECT INITIALLY CONTRACTED TO A FIRM IN EUROPE. THIS WAS PRECISELY THREE YEARS AGO AND ON OUR RECORDS OF ENTRIES, WE HAD TREATED THE CONTRACT AS HAVING BEEN EXECUTED AND COMMISSIONED ALONGSIDE WITH OTHERS NOW OUTSTANDING. IMPORTANTLY, IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE DIRECTORS INVOLVED IN THIS TRANSFER BUSINESS IN THEIR RECENT BOARD MEETINGS PRESENTED THE BILLS AND THIS AMONG OTHERS RECEIVED APPROVALS FOR IMMEDIATE REMITTANCE. MEANWHILE, WE HAVE WORKED OUT THE MODALITIES NEEDED TO TRANSFER THE FUND.
ALSO, WE WISH TO ASSURE YOU THAT YOUR INTEREST WILL BE PROTECTED AS REGARDS SECURITY, WHICH IS RISK-FREE. THEREFORE, WE URGENTLY REQUEST FOR YOUR BANK ACCOUNT PARTICULARS WHERE THE US$23.8M SHALL BE PAID INTO IN ONLY ONE INSTALLMENT. THAT IS THE ACCOUNT MUST BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE ABOVE SUM AT A GO. YOU WILL BE HEAVILY REWARDED FOR THE ACTIVE ROLL YOU WILL PLAY IN THIS BUSINESS. WE ARE NOT UNAWARE THAT THE FUND WHEN ARRIVES YOUR ACCOUNT WOULD SUFFER TAX AND OTHER BANK CHARGES IN YOUR COUNTRY.ALL WILL BE DEDUCTED BEFORE DISBURSEMENT. WE SHALL OPEN ACCOUNT IN YOUR COUNTRY WHERE OUR VARIOUS SHARES SHALL BE TRANSFERRED BUT THIS WILL BE FULLY DISCUSSED LATER.
FINALLY, WE BELIEVE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BUSINESS SHOULD NOT GO ON AIR. YOU SHOULD PLEASE TREAT IT AS STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL AND PLEASE REACH ME QUICKLY BY REPLYING ME FOR THE ACTION TO START.
ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES, I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ACCEPTANCE IN ADVANCE.
YOURS SINCERELY, DR. VICTOR ASHIEDU
