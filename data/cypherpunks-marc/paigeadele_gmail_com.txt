I've been doing some thinking about the internet tonight and came across
this e-mail by which I am intrigued. Currently we suffer from DDoS downtime
on Rackspace (granted it's a very small amount of time, its a hit to our
only single point of failure for which I am currently trying to solve by
obtaining a /24 and an anycast address as a means of mitigation and
providing a highly available HTTP cluster of load balancers. I can't help
but wonder if the cost (both in ipv4 resources and cash) outweighs the
worth of an environment that is sanctioned from the globe. While cloud
hosting has proven to be a scalable solution for our needs, we currently
are only serving US-based organizations as far as I know. Even so, the
desire to grow beyond that isn't far fetched when adding networks that are
still segregated from access outside of a country becomes more available
(kinda like vlans.)
Germany, Russia, and Spain.
