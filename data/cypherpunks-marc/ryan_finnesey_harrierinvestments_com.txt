Does anyone know when they took down connectivity in Egypt did they also
bring down the MPLS networks global companies use?

Urban legend, although widely believed. Someone probably made the
You mean, like drop a couple of trade towers and take out three class
five switches, causing communication outages throughout New England and
New Jersey, and affecting places as far away as Chicago?
Nope. Couldn't happen.
More seriously, yes, one could in fact take out any connectivity one
wants by withdrawing routes (which is reportedly what Egypt did), and if
you hit enough interchange points that could get serious.
At the risk of sounding naive and pollyanna-ish, we have a few more of
those interchange points in the US than they have in Egypt. In theory,
yes. Making it actually happen could be quite an operation.
