well, it
seems too good to be truth.
Recently we"ve got a lot of projects like that.
Yes, there are enthusiasts.
A real good ones.
But we should also ask ourselves,
(except what tpb-crypto mentiond), who these guys are? Could they be a
project of... the NSA itself?
I read their security section. The first thing in my mind (i am not tooooo
paranoid:)) is that it is too good. It is absolutely free WITHOUT any
mention of donations.
Not even a mention.
Who supports them? Can we trust him/it?
Are they millionaires:)?
We see not even one word about the money.
Second of all, when you read their
security section, its like a honey for bees - it invites you. Its ideal.
Too much ideal.
So yes, i rely on my feelings too, and there is something wrong with that.
These guys are from Germany:
It seems to me a better choice (except the problem of the fact that Germany
has got its nsa=bnd and that they give everything to nsa)
In the end, we need to trust someone. But we dont read their minds:). And
it could be, after all, a big fall.
We"ve got pgp. Thanks God.

@_subject: Fwd: The West's Shame 
Brad Cabana
The West's Shame
There is something so bizarre, so inhumane about Western countries
boycotting the parade for the 70th anniversary of the Soviet victory over
Germany in World War II that I just had to write on it. Recently, the prime
minister of the United Kingdom announced he will not be attending the
parade. Previous to that, countries like Germany and the United States had
announced the same. It's only a parade you say? No it's more than that.
The Soviet Union sacrificed 25 million people to defeat Nazi Germany in
World War II. A sacrifice beyond imagination, and far, far greater than all
the countries fighting Nazi Germany combined. In comparison, the Holocaust,
which is rightly remembered annually, claimed the lives of six million
people of the Jewish faith. These are really the two true tragedy's of
World War II unleashed on the world by Nazi Germany. The stories of Soviet
soldiers advancing without weapons to pickup the rifle of the next dead
soldier are well known. The bloodbath of Stalingrad, the siege of
Leningrad, the millions of Soviet soldiers killed and captured (only to
then die in POW camps) during the early days of the German invasion, and so
on, all markers of the brutality of man against his own, stand large in the
history of the world. In fact, the German invasion of the Soviet Union
stands as the largest military battle in the history of man.
Yet, western leaders have decided to not attend the parade that is meant to
honour that sacrifice. When Britain announced it would not attend, well,
that's the straw that broke the camel's back frankly. Of all the countries
in the world, Britain was saved by the massive waves of young Soviet men
and woman that bled the German army white. Hitler would have crushed
Britain in short order if he had not diverted millions of German men to the
invasion of the Soviet Union. Crucially, the diversion of aircraft,
fighters and bombers, to the Soviet front saved Britain from the entire
annihilation of a full blown, continuous air campaign, and the subsequent
naval invasion that would certainly have occurred. In reality, the western
allies left Stalin almost alone in Europe to battle the Nazi's, and take
the majority of the casualties in doing so. By the time D-Day finally
arrived, the German army and air force was only a shadow of it's former
self as it existed in 1941. As bad and hard as it was for the allies to
march east through Europe to Berlin, without the Soviet people's sacrifice,
it would have never happened.
It's a place of honour in human history. To quarrel with that is to go
beyond ignorance. To quarrel with that is the hateful and arrogant bastion
of the very seeds that caused World War II in the first place. And now, as
if history is repeating itself, Western leaders have entered that bastion
of ignorance and arrogance to punish Russia for the Ukrainian civil war. By
contrast, Russian president Putin, despite the ongoing conflict in Ukraine,
attended the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in France last year. He
was given the proverbial cold shoulder by western leaders, yet he subjected
himself to that, in honour of the sacrifice of the men of Canada, Britain
and the United States. He did not ignore the history or the price in blood
of that action. He honoured it. He put the sacrifice ahead of his political
position, and it could even be said his personal shunning. Now that the
time is here to do the same for the Soviet Union's dead, we cannot bring
ourselves to do the same.
What that says about us is really quite obvious. It means we haven't
learned the lessons of history. That our political leadership has become so
petty, so detached from historical reality, that it attempts to rewrite the
history of 25 million souls. That is the danger of all of this. Russians
don't really need the West to honour their sacrifice. They know it all too
well. It's the West that needs to honour that sacrifice so it can clearly
see the dangers of war on a scale far more destructive than anything it
experienced on the western front, or anywhere else in history. Poland
started this train rolling by refusing to invite the Russian president to
the Holocaust remembrance at Auschwitz last year. This despite the fact
that the Soviet army liberated all of Poland, and specifically Auschwitz
from German armies.
The actions of our western politicians say more about us than the Russians
could ever say themselves. They have portrayed us as people who refuse to
honour the dead, those that gave their lives in another time to defeat a
tyrant bent on world domination, and in doing so dishonour those men and
women. As the son of a young man, training in England, fighting in North
Africa, Italy, Holland, and Germany through those tumultuous years of war
and senseless slaughter, I recognize the Soviet sacrifice that probably
saved my Dad's life. How could you not? Yet, that is exactly what our
politicians are doing today. You don't have to be a lover of this country,
or that country to recognize and honour grave human injustice committed on
a massive scale. You just have to be humane, and subordinate your own bias
in the remembrance of the fallen. Is that really so hard? Isn't that what
is expected of us all? Wouldn't we expect that from our children? I've
never been so ashamed of the actions of our governments than I am now with
the boycott of that parade in Moscow.

It's my last comment on the Moon issue, i promise.
It is not pointless at all, buddy. Because the past SHAPES the present.
There is NO today without yesterday. And there is NO "good" today with
"rotten" yesterday (part of which is the moon flam).
We are talking here about a lie. A LIE as big as the size of the moon. *And
if a state can lie such lies, this kind of state has no right to call
itself "democratic/special/good/free/honest" state... or the leader of the
human race. Not talking about bombing other states "for the good sake of
all the others". Such State should be called with an appropriate name. And
have no rights on the world stage, not to mention a Leadership.*
It is indeed pointless to talk about the "great new world of today" which
you and many others see through pink glasses (and there is no such world
today). Because the US fabrication like the "moon" lie is shaping our
present (which you love so much), and even more -
*it is continuing to happen "HERE & NOW".*
Now, the US lie is not about the "moon" but about the bad Assad in Syria,
chemicals in Iraq, freedom to Lybian people, Russian invasion to
Ukraine...etc. It's all happening right here and right now, buddy (On
20/12/2015). *And will continue to happen until good and smart people will
believe in these lies *(this is the cause i write to this list trying to
prevent this)*. Or until there will be "sheeple" like you, who live in an
illusive "here & now" without caring about their yesterday/the truth.*

Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution is a book by Peter Kropotkin
Written partly in response to social Darwinism and in particular to Thomas
H. Huxley's Nineteenth Century essay, "The Struggle for Existence",
Kropotkin's book drew on his experiences in scientific expeditions in
Siberia to illustrate the phenomenon of cooperation. After examining the
evidence of cooperation in nonhuman animals, in pre-feudal societies and
medieval cities, and in modern times, he concluded that *cooperation and
mutual aid, and not Darwin's pitiless struggle, are the most important
factors in the evolution of species and the ability to survive.*

In other words, the bill doesn't automatically affect the status quo of

you are Facebook or Google (though the "going to jail" bit, if it were
possible, would be a good outcome for Facebook for example ... alas, I
And the determination of who has to hand over keys (i.e. who is a
"relevant operator") is nothing more than whatever the Home Secretary
(currently female it seems) says! Perhaps next week is her bad week of
the month and your free speech website (nicely TLSed with personally
issued and in person verified certificate provider keys etc) happens to

You say that as though there are good points, see above.
Thanks for quoting the relevant part of the act, and letting us know
that the definitions for "relevant operator"s will be handed down extra-

Hash: SHA512
The Dawn of the Crypto Age
by CANNON C. , in the year 2015
- -An essay on how crypto technologies will shape our world, and why these
technologies are often met with government opposition-
 Throughout all of the chapters of history, civilization struggles in a
constant battle between liberty and tyranny, progression and corruption.
For the world is plentiful in numerous points of its history of a populace
oppressed by governments. Like a beast untamed or loosened, or a fire
fueled and spread, it is the natural tendencies of governments to become
corrupt and to perpetually expand and maintain power. This is not because
government in itself is corrupt, but rather because mankind is corrupt
through greed, in the pursuit of wealth and power at the expense of a
nation while utilizing the powerful body of government as their tool.
Government makes a handsome target of exploitation to the corrupt and
enemies of liberty due to the centralization of power that governments
wield and the position of the tool of government being in the high layer of
power, known as the political realm.
 Until now, the balance of power sat in the hands of governments who have
gone rogue at the conduction of usurpers and tyrants and have been used to
empower themselves while oppressing the populace and liberty, whether
openly or covertly. However, in the modern age, in this dawn of the crypto
revolution which follows the still advancing and parallel technological
revolution, the balance of power in the world is shifting from that of
governments and usurpers to the people.
 Throughout history, humankind has been through various golden ages of
enlightenment, and of technological advancements and progressions. It is
this evolution in the advancement of humankind which has altered the
foundation for which future technology and the direction of civilization is
based. We have had the Age of Enlightenment, the scientific revolution, the
Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution, and the technological/informational
revolution, to name a few. And now, even when the latter is still young, we
enter another age that parallels it: the dawn of the crypto revolution,
which is based upon the infrastructure of the current
technological/informational revolution.
 The context of the word "revolution" in the case of this writing refers to
that of sudden change in the world brought about by advancements in
technologies and discoveries, while "crypto" or "cryptographic" is
referring to the use of encryption (codes) paired with technology to create
systems immune to espionage, control, and takedown by an enemy.
 The newly emerging technology brought about by the crypto revolution is
built on our current technological infrastructure. The advent of our
current computerized cyber-infrastructure makes an easy way to build, host,
and deploy decentralized protocols. It is also cyberspace that connects us
all and breeds innovation through uncensored and decentralized
communications such as the Internet, hence why the crypto revolution began
shortly after the birth of the technological revolution. This new
technology will secure itself and also secure society from the current
flaws in our informational technology infrastructure which that same
society has come to rely upon.
 The crypto revolution will alter the shape of the workings of civilization
in positive ways to advance us towards a more perfect civilization, just as
the technological revolution altered the way we communicate, do business,
interact, etc. And just as how the industrial revolution altered the way we
travel, manufacture, and live, to too shall the crypto revolution shape our
world. This time, this era in human progression will impact the workings of
the economy, politics, banking, governments... all in a way that will make
the workings of the pre-crypto age antiquated and perhaps even scoffed at
by future generations.
 Just as the crypto revolution is based on the technological revolution
which was based on the industrial revolution, so too shall some other
future progressions be based on the crypto revolution. These future
progressions as a result of the crypto revolution I foresee being comprised
of political, economic, and social advancements.
 Although progressions in the advancement of civilization are often
beneficial to the human race, advancement is sometimes met with opposition
by the existing power structure. This opposition by the minority who wield
power over the rest is due to the threat this new technology/discovery
presents to their power. Opposition can also often be due to lack of
understanding of the new technology.
 The future of technology I am describing can be referred to as
decentralized cryptographic protocols - secure, open source, self
regulating, decentralized, cryptographic protocols, to be more descriptive.
For the new way will be a better way, a way void of the major flaws and
imperfection of the former which have empowered the corrupt and created
insecure systems causing results which have haunted our society. These
newly emerging technologies will repair the security flaws which came about
by having a society that became reliant upon informational technology. The
root of many of the current security flaws in our world come from the
exploitation of vulnerabilities that are a result of the lack of the
following three items, which I refer to together as the triangle of
Integrity, Availability, and Confidentiality

The new list is not the preferable solution, you know. It's the only thing

KILL the original list. It will kill the whole concept and the core idea of

unambiguous understanding that *"THE CYPHERPUNK LIST-CONCEPT MUST EVOLVE,

should start LAving you, xorcist. Just lAving you!!! What a holy man we got
on the list... on day three he opens his hEAAAArt in front of all of us.
Come on, cia dude. Cut of your bullshit. You are not gonna buy followers by
acting like that.
xorcist to Juan:
Yeah, xorcist! Yeah! That's why you are on this list - hitting the "nerves"
and trying to brainwash people. Well, there were much better attempts
before you, fucker. We got a vast experience and great Hearts and Minds. So
you are not gonna succeed. There are Invincible GUARDS here on the list for
suckers like you. Zenaan and Juan are their names.
So just DIS-appear exactly the way you appeared here.
that's the only way for you.
However, i know that you won't (in the near future), 'cause your masters
won't let you. So, we will enjoy a few more knockouts for you.

Yeah, those guys are the true Cypher-Hacker-Punks. They should be

We should take into account, that almost all the critical vulnerabilities
were found in the NEW implementation of encrypting the boot loader that
supports UEFI (it was added a few months ago for the first time to support
encryption for the new Bios type machines). It's still not mature at
all.... so give it at least 6 more months to become stable.
*The bottom line of the audit (except the UEFI):*
It means that the core code/90% of the features in VeraCrypt are absolutely
strong and great, including encryption of Legacy Bios machines and creating
separated encrypted volumes.
