Normal people in developed countries who use tor to
  a) provide the background noise for the users that need protection,
  b) use it as a way around lack of WLAN security or other funny
     ideas of mobile interneter providers,
  c) protect themselves against government agencies who think
     accessing part of *their* content is suspicious by itself.
Count me in on a) and b).

Tor does a time check against other nodes. Can't we use that to obtain
the time as well?
I wouldn't mind running tor as root on a raspi dedicated as a tor node
on my DSL. Alternatively one could use a setuid helper binary to adjust
the clock and, on that occasion, to bind sockets to low ports (443/80).
(Both obviously restricted to specialized setups.)

The valuable part of tor is not the code base but the
installed base of relays; you can't just fork that.

Erm, how *do* you 'explore' hidden services? After all, they are
not indexed by google. And the little pointers google found for
me all seem not to work (the actual .onions they link). As opposed
to my own hidden services, so it's not the browser setup.
Any given jurisdiction will agree with that, though not
all on the same parts of the traffic.

Not impossible; but even if they start intercepting the relay
communication that data (and no small amount of it) is still sitting in
disparate systems and needs a) the software to actually do the correlation
and b) the means of all data being moved to one place.
Buying software for a) will probably show up in public records, and b)
may be hindered by the paranoia of the participating LEAs. Even the software
needed to get all the intercepted data in one place could be nightmarish.

Yes, over all typically 100 bytes of it.
That is, of course, completely inacceptable, especially in light of the
fact that those 100 bytes have been previously passed through a number
of crypto primitives which are much more efficient.
Yet much more consuming on the absolute scale.
...but not in a magnitude that needs calling other choices 'ridiculous'.
Especially when that choice is actually self-documenting without having
a separate protocol definition at hand.
(I'd probably be using json these days; telnet-capable protocols (or
their implementations) notoriously have quoting/escaping problems,
and protocol buffers have a bit of a versioning problem IIRC.)

Nope. NetBSD box.
I spare me the fuming part, and I don't look often. The annoying parts,
bandwith-wise, are the ssh login attempts anyway.
May I remind you who else is reading logs here?
(And for that matter, condescending?)
You're evading.
Irony-proof, too.
But why would you edit out (and claim it was your service ID)
when the value is pretty obviously not a key or anything?
(You don't get something systematic like a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9 as
a random value very often.)
You don't seem to have any credible proof, either.
In that case: Levae.

@_subject: Re: [tor-talk] Is this a practical vulnerability? 
The purpose of the remark was get any concrete information on the
kinds of attack you were experiencing. If those are the same that
everyone on the internet is getting then it is hardly a sign of
you being under attack specifically after having accessed your
own hidden service.
Did you run the server before (I suppose not) and have the firewall
rules before so you could cross-check the attacks after the hidden
service with the time before?
I just operate a few http servers that have practically no regular
traffic, so my httpd logs are a pure trace of the vulnerabilities
that linger in diverse popular web applications.
Likewise I see the constant influx of windows RPC/messages/RDP stuff
in my firewall logs; and I wonder whether you actually know what
life on the internet is, or whether you simply installed the web
server & hidden service, saw all the shit hitting the server and
went 'omg, tor is obviously borken'.
So, what *are* the details of the traffic, especially in comparison to
the usual background, that can even indicate that there was a specific
attach on your server at that time.
Or, for instance, what are the signs I should be looking for in my
firewall/httpd logs to see whether there was a similar attack on
my systems after I started my hidden services.
Yeah, sure. I can research how you were specifically attacked. Care
to give some google keywords for that?
So what? The question is not whether someone is doing that, the
question is what makes you think you're getting these attacks
a) in relation to your hidden service and b) they are happening
only to you.
Yeah, sure. I get the same of every http server I have in the open
internet. Someone is always sweeping the internet for vulnerable
systems; the vulnerabilities change, the sweeping doesn't.
Nothing to see here, please move along and come up with something else.
Besides, the /{Tor hidden service ID}/nonexistentfile.php is
Yes, they are.
Those don't attack the web server per se but some types of blog/forum
software. That's nothing you need a hidden service to be attacked with.

Welcome to the internet. Have an open web server, and it will get
accessed by scum that tries known vulnerabilities: /memberlist.php,
How can you tell that from firewall logs? If it just blocks the access
you will only see the source address, but not the actual HTTP request.
Can you be any more detailed about those attacks? What commands, on
what service, and why do you even get to know the commands if there
is no such service on your computer?

Put new clients into the next instance of this service, formally
operated by someone else?
Lawful intercepts also include the access metadata (which I assume to
be equally secure here), and access to the emails themselves. While
encrypted the service still has to know source and destination to
some extent.
Also, LI interception is a cost factor.
I guess under NSLs this could be construed as publishing same,
so the NSL effectively forces you to stay in business.

I think you slightly disregard who is actually interested in a
trustworthy tor network. What you describe makes the tor operators
a cabal, and the problem is that the ones who actually want to
trust tor (the users) are outside that.
Besides, many attacks don't require to *run* the nodes, just to
monitor its traffic. And a TLA can do that without the honest
operator even suspecting.

A tap is a completely passive thing. The tapper just looks at where
the VPN traffic comes from and goes to, and what plaintext traffic
is happening at the same time, and can guess from that which VPN
source IP is talking to what plaintext destination IPs (and also
which plaintext output IP each VPN user has been assigned).
No need to decrypt or MITM anything for that.

In blocking countries you'll use Tor whether you to the .com
or the .onion domain. The way around the block is tor, not the
hidden service.
The hidden service add a protection layer to the traffic from
the tor network to facebook, but they are using SSL anyway.
And it remains to be seen what they do with static assets
that are loaded from different domains - but actually it wouldn't
matter when those are not going through the hidden service.
