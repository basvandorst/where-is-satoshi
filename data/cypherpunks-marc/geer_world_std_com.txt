You are, of course, assuming that RFID money that has been
damaged will still be accepted without manual processing
delays to the putative depositor.  I can, after all, tear
all my paper USD in half but I will surely then incur some
manual processing delay when uploading them to the bank,
likely in proportion to the size of my deposit.  The real
question might be whether instead of today's dye pack one
got an EMP generator as a special gift when holding up the
local S&L.

Not arguing, but the hardware cost curve for storage has a shorter
halving time than the cost curve for CPU (Moore's Law) and the
corresponding halving time for bandwidth is shorter still.
If that relationship holds up over a period of years, today's
tradeoffs between cache, re-computation, and anticipatory
transmission would presumably change in the direction the
economics dictates.
And of course, if I really care that a particular piece of data
is non-discoverable I either have to encrypt it, never transmit
it, or go on one whopping search mission.
Or so I think.  Does the world look different from your vantage?

Maybe Chalabi made up a story that turned out
to be true and, like the 1965 movie "I saw what
you did and I know who you are" where a pair
of teenagers make prank calls at random and say
that sentence -- which is fun until they ring
up a guy who just murdered his wife -- now has
to explain that which is impossible to explain.
