These tools are making their way around. A few weeks ago I got offered to
make a free 100 usd outside a walmart. Open an account, get it to retrieve
money, then they would "cause an error in the machine", and have it spit
all the money.
As far as I know they only targeted Bank of America, might be something
particular with those machines.
