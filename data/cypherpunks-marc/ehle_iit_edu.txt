This has to be the most interesting piece of SPAM i've ever run across...
but this is NOT the correct forum for it. Please refrain from sending
anything not pertaining to Debian Security to this list in the future.
Just for the record, I am not intersted in purchasing anything and do not
wish to recieve any additonal unsolicited mail.
Thank you.
