If it just happened, and you have a recent backup, all you should have to restore would be the userXXX.db where XXX is the FID for the user.  They would obviously loose any mail sent to them since the backup.

What is the procedure for restoring a person's e-mail what has happened
was the user set the date of his computer to year 2000 for testing, but
since there was a 60 day purge of all e-mail the user lost all of his
e-mail, what files do I need to restore, to get the users e-mail back
from tape.
