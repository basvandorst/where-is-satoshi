I would argue that 1024 DHE is worse than no PFS, for the same reason
that using DES is a bad move. It is likely to be inherently insecure and
provides a higher sense of security than is valid for the situation. By
insisting that 1024 to be ok, you are, in theory, permitting people to
feel comfortable with an insecure system.
I have always approached that no encryption is better than bad
encryption, otherwise the end user will feel more secure than they
should and is more likely to share information or data they should not
be on that line.
By insisting on 2048 (or higher), you force the issue and ensure that
the overall network is more secure.

Not quite.
If people agree on Twofish and a generalized standard outside of NIST,
then if NIST picks it up and agrees as well there isn't much concern.
The problem is with older existing standards or if NIST provides
unexplained changes or magic values to the standard.

Hash: SHA1
I agree fully Jon,
I short, I feel that all trust for NIST has to be broken. It doesn't
matter if AES or SHA-2 is broken or not broken. You cannot go into a
security environment with a tool that is known to be compromised
(NIST) and just hope and pray that the pieces you are using aren't the
compromised pieces.
There are alternatives, it doesn't hurt to get them in place.

I would also state though, to avoid being too conspiratorial. That it
can also imply that AES is simply in peril and they want to move off of
it before it is fully broken.

The real problem only arises when the fed funding determines the

If anyone reads this and doesn't think they haven't pulled the same
gambit with every US cloud service provider, they are kidding themselves.
This, in my opinion, can make all US encryption, even US-based
certificate authorities really untrustworthy. What is to stop them from
getting GoDaddy to give up their root certificates with a NSL and a
small legal justification?
Once they have it, they could, in theory, MitM attack a ton of servers,

Legally rolling them would defeat the point of the request and thus likely
out you in contempt.
The only solution is to not have the private key itself available to you
and design the system such that you don't need it to do the minimal job
Adminning the server.
It's like having no logs. You can't give away something you don't have. The
solution is to design the systems so Americans simply don't have access to
the info being requested.

No. You receive the data over an ssl encrypted stream just like everyone

Crazy idea.
Put the server into the hands of a third party outside of the US. Have
that 3rd party have total and absolute rights to the SSL root
certificate and your party to not have any capacity to force said party
to hand over the certificate. You use it, but you don't have any ability
to actually get access to it directly.
Crazy idea, but I wonder if there would be some way to make this work
where even if they tried to force you, you couldn't hand it over.

The NSA has an almost unlimited budget. I could easily see them being

official enemies of the US, it would allow the NSA to directly screw
around with them.
True, but the mining needs to happen in the open somehow.
Actually, someone mentioned the fact that they could just do the "think
of the children" CP/Drugs line, and that would resolve the problem more
or less in the public eye. Especially when you combine that with
"proceeds of a crime" laws, arguably turning a bitcoin into a similar
object as a stolen stereo.
In China and other similar countries they are dealing with it in a more
direct manner, essentially telling people that if they continue to use
it there will be severe consequences. Hence why the banks in China
backed out so quickly.
Unfortunately, utopian thinking is commonly wishful thinking, that's why
so many bad things happen when utopian extremists start to get their way.

Having worked on some complex banking and accounting systems before, I know
there is a lot more to the equation than simple coding up some crappy ruby
code and putting fixes in place whenever it doesn't quite do what you want.
Financial cryptography is expensive to do mostly because there is a strong
need to not only implement good code, but also make sure the engineering is
done correctly the first time and that it has the expensive physical
security to back it up.
