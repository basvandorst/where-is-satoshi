Could you please explain why you think they are ridiculous.
Where did the word "certified" come from?  I have not said anything
about magically fixing a specification.
The CompCert people are claiming a formally verified compiler and I
think this claim is very misleading to say the least.
I did not say that this project was misguided.
Yes, the axioms.  These need to be small in number and 'obviously'
correct; something that cannot be said of the source code of coq.
The nearest I can think of is the Lisp subset written in itself in
under a 100 lines (my memory is vague on this point)
Why not?  What work has been done on the coq+other tools that has not
been done on f2c?
I describe work that was done to try and show the correctness of
a Model Implementation for C here:

The claim of CompCert being a formally verified C compiler is wildly overstated:
It is a good start, but they still have lots of work to do.
