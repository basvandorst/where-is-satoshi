haha, that's a good one.  Only a job recruiter could smile while spouting

Several responses have stated, and questioned, the children's rights
accessing the Internet.  Yes, with supervision.  What all the responses
have missed is the lack of distinction between communication and email.
Claiming a child has a right to private extra-familial communications is as
divided as the general access to the Internet.  With supervision, without
any more or less privacy than the child has in non-virtual communications.
And, what hasn't been connected to deciding on the level of supervision,
the developmental state of the child is highly relevant.
Claiming a child merits access - with or without supervision - can only be
made by the primary custodians of the child.
We wish to ignore this subtlety because we wish to ignore Society's
overbearing on all of us.
The result in this specific scenario is, regardless of the child, the
custodians require and merit a higher degree of technical faculty.  To
presume it is less than the childs is a mistake.  Along with this ability
comes the burden of communication: to provide an appropriate example.  As
with many non-virtual counterparts:   many failure.  such sad.
Why should this medium of bits be different?

Yes, Yes I am.
Let's be more specific.
Child:  a minor under custodianship of another.
Supervision:  providing meaningful oversight.
No child would rightfully be raised without supervision - you don't let
toddlers walk across the street, you don't let 6 year olds watch porn, and
you don't let teens go to the local pub (okay, last one is location
dependent).  Are you committing child-porn when you oversee your 2 year old
dressing?  Are you censoring their ability to dress themselves by helping
them choose (weather, etc) appropriate clothes?
Many things in life, while we are growing and becoming mature (a process
lasting well into our mid-20s), require oversight.  Both for safely and
utility.  We can pretend otherwise at our and the child's own peril.  Go
ahead and let your child smoke cigs, watch porn and read reddit; it's your
child - do as you feel best - I suspect my child will find yours to be ....
socially repugnant.
The point is blanket statements like you made are corrosive to the
understanding of the discussion.  Unfettered support of "the child" in all
situations is counterproductive.
Don't get going on "Parents don't always know best" ... true, they don't -
but as long as Society allows any person in any circumstance to _have_ a
child without any sort of parenting training, oversight, counselling, then
Society must allow that person the ability to _raise_ their child.  For
better or ill.

I think looking for a "personal police" is missing the point.
When I was a child, and "misbehaved" ... [[[ do we even agree children
do??  If not ... well, happily I'm too old to ever have to live around your
children ]]] ... when he would scold me, often he would say "I don't like
being the policeman"
His point was until I (as a growing child) developed my own sense of what
is right/wrong, he would happily provide that guidance for me -- which, as
a parent, is his obligation/prerogative/joy.
As is being done - exploding this Child Supervision thread into the
perennial "Nanny State" argument does have one merit.  If an individual
fails to adhere to guidelines of their Society, they are punished.  That is
what Society is for.  The Nanny State advocates would like to see members
of Society be given greater guidance by the State so as to avoid those
excursions of acceptability.  The detractors believe everyone has the same
intuited/divinely inspired ability to adhere to Society's laws on their
own.  Both miss the others point, as has been done in this thread.  That
is, all people up to a certain age must have guidance and after a certain
age; must have the chance not to have that guidance.  With an appropriate
period of transition.
Quick question for those claiming "let the child alone, she'll be happier
on the Internet without muddling parents."  ... do you have dependents?
you taught to drive?  by giving them the car keys and then going on
vacation?  and now they have perfect driving habits?  Which they
miraculously learned on their own: no doubt YouTubing Mario Andretti, and
reading that one wikihow page.
