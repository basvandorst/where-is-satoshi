                (ACCOUNT PROVISION FOR US$15M).
Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as
a surprise and if it might offend you for Without your
prior consent,I am writing you through this channel.
Briefly,I am Dr.Sr.Jeremiah West,(K.S.M).THE CHAIRMAN of the Contract Awarding Committee of the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST
AFRICAN STATES (E.c.o.w.a.s),with Headquarters in Lome,the Republic of Togo,West Africa.I got your information/contact in a business directory from the Togolaise Chamber of Commerce and Industries
when I was searching for a reliable,honest and trustworthy person to entrust this business with.I was simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact from the many names and lists in the directory.
After discussing my view and your profile with my colleagues,they were very much satisfied and i decided
to contact you immediately for this mutual business relationship.We wish to transfer the sum of US$15,000,000.00 (FIFTEEN Million United States Dollars).into your personal or company`s bank account.This fund was a residue of the over invoiced contract bills awarded by the(E.c.o.w.a.s).body for the supply of ammunitions,hard/soft wares,phamaceauticals/medical items,light and heavy duty vehicles,apperals and other administrative logistics e.t.c for the Economic Community Monitoring Group(E.C.O.M.O.G),a security Force of the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES (E.c.o.w.a.s)in Sierria-Leone and Liberia during the Peace Keeping Projects.
This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the available loope holes sealed off.As the Chairman of the Contract Awarding Committee(C.A.C).I have the co-operation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of the Organisation.We arranged and over invoiced the contract funds supplied by different companies from different countries of the world during the crisis in some West African Countries. It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of West Africa.This is borne out of our beleif in the non-stable and sporous political nature of this sub-region.
The original contractors have been duely paid by the Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest (Central Bank of the West African States)through our
bankers-Societe Generale Banque.This balance is suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company/person of our choice.We intend to transfer out this fund NOW as the organisation is winding up its peace keeping activities since the aim of returning PEACE to the countries and the coast has been achieved.
Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil servants working under this organisation,are not allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your comprehensive
advise,assistance and partnership in your country.
It is however agreed,as the account owner in this deal to allow you 30% of the entire sum as compensation, 65% will be held on trust for us while 5% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost during the course of the transaction.
This transaction will be successfully concluded within
14 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due co-operation.You should provide the followings if you sincerely wish to assist in this transaction;      YOUR COMPANY`S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS,TEL
     AND FAX NUMBERS.(if available)
     THE NAME OF YOUR BANK,ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL,FAX
     AND TELEX NUMBERS:
     THE ACCOUNT NUMBER:
     THE COMPLETE MAILING ADRRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY(YOU OR YOUR
     COMPANY) WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.
Upon the receipt of this informations,the documents of approval with the texts will be sent to you for confirmaton and then be forwarded to the organisation for ratification and subsequent payment and transfering of the funds into your provided bank account.
As with the case of all organised (sensitive)and conspired DEALS,we solicit for your unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this business.We hope to retire peacefully and live a honourable business life afterwards.There are no risks involved.
REPLY A.S.A.P.INDICATING YOUR INTENTIONS TOWARDS THIS TRANSACTION PROPOSAL.
BEST REGARDS.
