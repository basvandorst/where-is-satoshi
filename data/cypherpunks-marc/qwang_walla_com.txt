@_subject: TRANSACTION OVERTURE 
This is a proposal in context but soliciting for your unreserved assistance in carrying out an urgent transaction. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
Please you did not get this email in error; I had to search for your contact myself on the internet. What I require of you is your trust for what I want to expose to you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client in the bank General Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months when the money was matured several notice was sent to him, even during the war. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later I found out that the General and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit his home.
After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank.
No doubt this proposal will make you apprehensive, please I employ you to observe complete confidentiality and be assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us so please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters of this issue. There is no stress involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. You may reply to my email: qwang
if you are interested.
I will provide you with more details as soon as I receive your earliest response to this letter.
Kind Regards
Mr Wang Qin
