The extra 4 bits add quite a bit, subjectively. I've compared the same
CD on the same system with an HDCD player and non-HDCD player.
The other formats of note are probably SACD and then DVD-Audio. SACD
is multichannel 16-bit/44.1kHz... so multichannel CD without additional
sample resolution (if I recall). SACD is not "backwards compatible"
though, whereas HDCD is.
DVD-Audio is really the way to go, though... 24-bit/96kHz multichannel
or up to 192kHz two-channel. Lots more bits, lots more samples. It makes
a huge difference on "pretty good or better" gear.

Hrm, you're right. I was sure I'd tested Evolution. That's too bad...
they picked the wrong thing to implement in a big way.

in an
Opportunistic SSL/TLS will only work if people configuring it are of the
mind that it's better to encrypt than not. No public SMTP server should
require valid certificates or give any more trust over SSL than they do
over not-SSL. This way, the links get encrypted.
Anything else (on public SMTP servers) is misconfiguration. Now you
could *add* trust, as appropriate, if you do see certs (or whatever)
that you like, but it's always better to encrypt than not, even if
no additional trust is gained.

Yes, Eudora is the exception. It supports both STARTTLS and dedicated
SSL ports for all mail protocols (it even does SMTPS I think).

Hash: SHA1
BTW, most and probably all of the major mail clients out there will do
STARTTLS *for SMTP*. It's a matter of servers offering it and clients
being configured to actually use it. It'd be nice if they always used it
if it's available, but right now I think they all require being told to.
Specifically, Mozilla, Outlook, Outlook Express, Netscape (all the way
back to 4.7x at least), Evolution, and Eudora all support STARTTLS
(again, for SMTP). I imagine there are others that do as well.
Amusingly, virtually none of them support STARTLS on any other protocol.
:) IMAP and POP are almost all supported only on dedicated SSL ports
(IMAPS, POP3S). Argh.
