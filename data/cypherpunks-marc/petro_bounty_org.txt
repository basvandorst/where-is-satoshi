Refrigerator coming on, heating (or cooling) units kicking on and off, creaking from the wind blowing, the tick of a clock, the whirr of computers running (well, in my home). The subtle click of the cocker engaging will (a) be lost in the other noises and (b) is innocuous enough that they probably won't. If it was something I worried about (I don't keep a loaded firearm in the house for home protection at this point, I'm not high enough profile for the Feebs or the BATF to want to raid my "compound", nor am I a sufficient irritant to the local Gestapo, and my neighborhood is relative free of home burglary/home invasion type crimes that I feel it is better to keep the guns in a locker than on my bedside table) I would simply put the gun under a pillow to muffle the noise further, engage the cocker and start hunting.
render irrelevant the click, you can wait until you're bringing the pistol online for firing to cock it (squeeze the cocker as part of the final presentation), or as Black Uni noted, one can squeeze the trigger first, then engage the cocker (although this would take a bit of  >The squeeze cocker is a solution for a non-existent problem.

 feature I like in that firearm. My reasons for choosing the firearm, from most important to the utterly trivial and pretty silly are:
me (this is a function of ergonomics, and will vary for different reducing muzzle flip and allowing for *much* faster followup shots.
factory mags are very sturdy and take a lot of abuse).
comfortable conceal carry piece, if I ever wind up doing so.
release than a frame or slide mounted release.  Yes, that lever serves multiple functions, it cocks the weapon and serves as a slide release, you don't have to move your hand, change your grip on the weapon, or use your other hand to release the slide, just get a grip.
booooring. (yes, I said utterly trivial and pretty silly).
little research and time I could come up with some minor nits about it to blow up all out of proportion to the weapons utility and ablities.

robust and reliable.
important thing is ergonomics. I've owned a Beretta 92, a Tanfoglio (eaa witness) .45, and a HK P7. I've fired glocks, Sigs, Browning Hi-powers (and clones/redesigns) and a wide variety of 1911s.
they don't feel "right", while the browning Hi-power, the HK P7, Beretta etc. all felt good. The P7 being the best IMO.
reliable as long as you don't make too many modifications to it.
worth talking about.
ways to achieve good accuracy, one is to be born with a natural talent. The other is to practice practice, practice. With 9mm being significantly cheaper than .40, you can practice a lot more for the same effectiveness of the .45 against them either.

In fact if you look at the slide on a CZ100, there is an odd "dongle" or lump between the rear sight and the ejection port. Rumor has it that this dongle is intended to be used to engage the slide on the pistol belt to rack the first round into the chamber enabling a patrol officer to bring his pistol into action single handed (apparently many European officers also tend to work with police dogs, and having one hand on the leash means it can't be used to rack the slide).

incidence of B&E/Home Invasion, and one is afraid that their home will be hit. While this is a *very* good reason to have a loaded firearm close at hand, quite frankly there is a higher chance that the home will be burgled while you are away. Smart thing to do is move to a less dangerous neighborhood.
can use force with little or no repercussion, be that government or any other gang of thugs, and one wants to "go down fighting".  (lets' face it, no matter how good you are, no matter how fast and accurate, you aren't going to win a firefight with the kind and number of troops the government, be it city, state, or federal is going to throw at you, all you can hope to do is repel the first attack, and take more of them than there are of you). In this case, there isn't a lot you can do.

Mounting a file system, especially the OS/Application parts (as opposed to user or "home" directories) is, quite frankly silly. Once the disk is mounted an attacker has plenty of access to the volume, and the disk is likely to stay mounted for weeks at a time. To have to enter a password to boot the machine can really be a pain in the ass, especially if the one or two people who know the password aren't around when you need the machine Mounting home directories makes more sense, and the proper way to do that is when the user logs in, but you still have the issue of the contents being exposed while they are logged in.
Allowing the user--any user--to mount and unmount encrypted filesystems at will *is* the proper way to do this, and that is, on Unix, best done via some sort of loopback filesystem It allows for all of the things that Admins want to be able to do with their systems, back them up, move files from one disk to another, volume management (like LVM) etc. *and* allows the end user to *control their own level of privacy*.
