Hi Karsten, (strange to write that *g*)
At the moment I count 630 TCP connections using netstat. And I don't
know about /proc/user_beancounters, but that file is empty.
I don't have any long-term experience with 1blu so far. Maybe they shut
down my node as soon as they find out why it produces so much traffic.
And maybe they change their contracts as soon as everybody is running
Tor servers at them from now on. Let's wait and see.
Personally, I don't know so much about e-mail anonymizers, yet. So, if
you have information that I cannot find in a two-minutes Google session,
yes, please send it to me.

They offer "1blu-vServer Unlimited" with unlimited traffic volume for 17
euros per month. I don't know if it's the best offering, so I decided to
give them a try. Are there other good offerings for (virtual) Linux
servers with unlimited traffic?
OK. Does someone else have scruples about it?

this question is not directly related to the described case.
I would like to contribute some more Tor servers running at different
providers across Germany (probably not in the same /16 network). My
current server is a virtual server at 1blu that has a bandwidth of 931
KB/s which makes it the 71st fastest Tor server in the network. Maybe
other providers are even faster than 1blu. Just as a comparison: the
fastest Tor server at the moment has 4533 KB/s.
Do you think it's a privacy problem to run 3 to 5 servers? All servers
would be non-exit servers because of the current habit of the German
police to collect all exit servers. Of course, I will set the family entry.
Just want to ask in advance.
