Alas, this doesn't fully mitigate the issue, because it's not exactly
difficult to get a key into somebody's keyring, especially with the
existence of the auto-key-retrieve option. All I would have to do would
be to sign the key of somebody in the strong set lots of times with
the same key, and then send you an email signed by me, and an email with
a body signed by the key I was attacking (I could find some sort of
statement signed by that key online somewhere). Alternatively, I could
construct a Git repository that would load the keys into your keychain
in the correct order when you examined the commit signatures if I could
find a commit signed by my victim somewhere. I'm sure it's easy enough
to get a public key imported even without auto-key-retrieve, too. I
imagine there are MUAs that would import a key attached to a message,

Just as a point of interest, I've talked to the people running
keys.openpgp.org about their capacity in  when we were exploring
whether to change the default keyserver in Nixpkgs' GnuPG[1] (which we
ended up doing).
The impression I got was that they're very optimistic about their
ability to handle traffic to their server -- they were happy to have a
distro make the switch, and will be changing the defaults in Enigmail
and OpenKeychain very soon, as I understand it.
It is a real shame that a decentralized Hagrid isn't really possible,
though, at least to my understanding. It's quite the limitation for
