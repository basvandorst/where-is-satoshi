The white paper for TAPOS is from 11/28/2013 for what it's worth
The proposal in the white paper is to have "guardians" of the chain who hold large stakes (in coin-age terms) and are ready to spend it on the original chain should they detect a double spending attack. This could be automated in the clients... if you see a reorg happening, automatically start making transactions on the real branch.
I'm not suggesting it as a fix to TAPOS, it's just a property you need to avoid this type of attack. It's a property that Bitcoin verifies for instance.

Another flaw in TAPOS is that the weight given by a transaction to the chain can be extremely high. Thus, an attacker can force a reorganization and successfully double spend merely by keeping a large txout handy, ready to be spent on the fork.
In general, unless the weight of each block is bounded and the average block has a weight close to that bound, you're subject to this type of attacks.
