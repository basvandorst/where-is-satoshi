Edlyn Teske [1] describes a way in which you select one curve and then find=
 a second curve together with an isogeny (essentially a group homomorphism)=
 to the first curve. The first curve is susceptible to Weil descent attacks=
, making it feasible to compute d.log.s on the curve. The other curve is no=
t susceptible to Weil descent attacks.
You publish the latter curve, and keep the first curve and a description of=
 the isogeny suitable for computation to yourself. When you want to compute=
 a d.log. on the public curve, you use the isogeny to move it to your secre=
t curve and then use Weil descent to find the d.log.
I suppose you could generate lots of such pairs of curves, and at the same =
time generate lots of curves from seeds. After a large number of generation=
s, you find a collision. You now have your trapdoor curve. However, the amo=
unt of work should be about the square root of the field size.
Do we have something here?
(a) Weil descent (mostly) works over curves over composite-degree extension=
 fields.
(b) Cryptographers worried about curves over (composite-degree) extension f=
ields long before Weil descent attacks were discovered. (Some people like t=
hem because they speed things up slightly.)
(c) NIST's extension fields all have prime degree, which isn't optimal for =
Weil descent.
(d) NIST's fields are all too big, if we assume that NSA couldn't do 2^112 =
computations in 1999.
(e) This doesn't work for prime fields.
It seems that if there is a trapdoor built into NIST's (extension field) cu=
rves, NSA in 1999 was way ahead of where the open community is today in the=
ory, and had computing power that we generally don't think they have today.
We have evidence of NSA doing bad things. This seems unlikely to be it.
