According to the author of a biography on bin Laden, interviewed on
this morning's NPR coverage, he uses only person-to-person
communication with people bound to him by blood.
That interview should be available on the archive soon.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Included below is the ASCII CFP for our upcoming PKI research
workshop.  We're especially soliciting papers on ways to use public
key authentication/authorization that solve real problems, rather
than merely follow the traditional marketing patter about PKI.
1st Annual PKI Research Workshop
April 24-25, 2002. NIST, Gaithersburg MD, USA.
Sponsors include NIST, NIH, and Internet2.
To a large extent, the hoped-for public key infrastructure (PKI) has
not "happened yet."  PKI for large, eclectic populations has not
materialized; PKI for smaller, less diverse "enterprise" populations
is beginning to emerge, but at a slower rate than many would like or
had expected.  Why is this?
This workshop among leading security researchers will explore the
issues relevant to this question, and will seek to foster a long-term
research agenda for authentication and authorization in large
populations via public key cryptography.  The workshop is intended to
promote a vigorous and structured discussion---a discussion
well-informed by the problems and issues in deployment today.
We solicit papers, panel proposals, and participation.
     * Papers and Proposals Due: January 28, 2002
     * Authors Notified: March 5, 2002
     * Final Materials Due: April 1, 2002
     * Workshop: April 24-25, 2002.
Submitted works for panels and papers should address one or more
critical areas of inquiry.  Topics include (but not are not limited
     * Cryptographic methods in support of security decisions
     * The characterization and encoding of security decision data
     name spaces, x509, SDSI/SPKI, XKMS, PGP, SAML, KeyNote,
     policy mappings and languages, etc.
     * The relative security of alternative methods for supporting
     decisions;
     * Privacy protection and implications of different approaches;
     * Scalability of security systems; (are there limits to growth?)
     * Security of the rest of the components of a system;
     * User interface issues with naming, multiple private keys,
     disclosure
     * Mobility solutions
     * Approaches to attributes and delegation
     * Discussion of how the "public key infrastructure" required may
     differ from the ``PKI'' traditionally defined
Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF.  The final version
of refereed papers should ideally be between 8 and 15 pages, and in
case more than 20 pages.  Proposals for panels should be no longer
than five pages in length, and should include possible panelists, and
an indication of which of those panelists have confirmed
Full instructions will appear on our Web site by December 15, 2001.

I should hope they do.  My point is only that I, as the relying
party, have not been shown that proof.  The PKI has not conveyed that
evidence to me.  The propper authorization certificate would have.

If that's not good enough for you, go to where you have an SSL secured page.  SSL prevents a man in the middle
attack, right?  This means your credit card info goes to Palm
Computing, right?  Check the certificate.

@_subject: Re: Overcoming the potential downside of TCPA 
The only thing to stop that is the certificate on the TCPA's built-in
key.  You would have to shave one TCPA chip and use its key in the
virtualized version.  If you distributed that shaved key publicly or
just to too many people, then its compromise would likely be detected
and its power to attest to S/W configuration would be revoked.
However, if you kept the key yourself and used it only at the same
frequency you normally would (for the normal set of actions), then
the compromise could not be detected and you should be able to run
virtualized very happily.
That's one of the main problems with TCPA, IMHO, as a security
mechanism: that its security depends on hardware tamper resistance --
but at the same time, the TPM needs to be a cheap part, so it can't
be very tamper resistant.
