@_subject: Re: [Cfrg] Requesting removal of CFRG co-chair 
This debate started as a discussion of the =B3Dragonfly=B2 protocol.  The c=
cryptographic mechanism has been reviewed in multiple forums for two years
and is incorporated into IEEE standards.  It is not an optimal mechanism,
but was constructed for it=B9s IPR considerations to serve a specific
purpose.  It is useable and secure for the intended use cases and the
protocol should progress forward.  The discussions on the CFRG list for
time were productive and contributed to improvements in the protocol.
The CFRG co-chair=B9s support of advancing the protocol has unfairly been
turned into a witch hunt.  The collateral damage is the stopping a
potentially useful protocol mechanism.
It is embarrassing to me to see the technical debate in the IETF lowered
to the point that we are removing and rejecting people by their
affiliation.  The whole point of standards is to bring into a room a group
of competitors and work through a process to create technical solutions in
a productive manner.  A continued debate on individuals open affiliations
is not productive.  We should not proceed with a witch hunt to remove
Government employees from the IETF.
Anyone with experience in standards activities should already be wary of
motives that drive each of the contributions.  I=B9d rather have my
competitor (or in this case the NSA) in the room to get whatever reading I
can on their positions on our technical work.  We will always have to
second guess the motives of individuals bringing work into our open forums.
