This is the first reasonable, rational, and well-defined argument for not
making the transition to IPv6. As to someone's question about "Are you a terrorist?" If there is such a
construct as a transitive noun, then this might qualify. People rarely
describe themselves as terrorists, typically non-disinterested third-parties
describe them as such.
