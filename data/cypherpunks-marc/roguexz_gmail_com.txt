Hi Karl,
I am able to use Skype on F7. There are a few issues with Skype. Firstly, if you make changes to the audio system when skype is running, it does not seem to pick up the changes. So, quit skype before making any changes via the volume control applet.
Second, I would suggest that you download and install audacity (available via yum => yum install audacity). Audacity should show up under Applications -> Sound & Video ... Once you have started this software, ensure that the correct input device is selected, now try recording some voice and see if the mic is working. If this works, then in most probability Skype should also work. So startup skype and give it a shot.
If you still see issues, that is you are unable to hear your own voice on the test call, then you might want to tinker around with Skype's audio settings.
I do clearly remember that Skype did cause me quite a few problems on FC6, but somehow, things look much better on F7.
hope that helps you out.
