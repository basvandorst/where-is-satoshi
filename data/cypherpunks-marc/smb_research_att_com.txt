In message <5.0.2.1.0.20010914161852.00a9cbf0 Declan McCullagh This is seriously misleading.  Although there are a fair number of objectionable items in the bill (the worst of which are likely unconstitutional, though you'd have to explain protocol layering to a judge to make that point clear), the bill is concerned with pen registers and trap-and-trace devices.  It does not legalize "warrantless wiretaps".  And yes, Carnivore can be used more freely under this bill, but only in its pen register mode.
There's a lot to worry about; we do ourselves a disservice by attacking the wrong things.

Right -- there are factors pushing in both directions, and I don't know how it balances.
Your mention of Unicode, though, brings up another point:  the encoding that's used can matter, too.  If UCS-2 or UCS-4 (16 and 31-bit encodings) are used, I believe that there are many constant bits per character.  Even UTF-8 would have that effect.

@_subject: password-cracking by journalists... 
A couple of months ago, a Wall Street Journal reporter bought two
abandoned al Qaeda computers from a looter in Kabul.  Some of the
files on those machines were encrypted.  But they're dealing with
that problem:
Does anyone have any technical details on this?  (I assume that it's
a standard password-guessing approach, but it it would be nice to know
for certain.  If nothing else, are Arabic passwords easier or harder
to guess than, say, English ones?)

I can't speak for other countries, but the U.S. already has well-defined procedures for trading in damaged currency.  For example, if you have >3/5 of the bill, you get full value; between 2/5 and 3/5, you get half-value; below that, you get nothing.  I believe that such exchanges can be done at any bank, though I could be wrong about that.
Anyway -- I'd assume that similar procedures would be put in place for tagged bills.  Validation might inlude a waiting period to see if the tag corresponding to that serial number shows up.

@_subject: Re: DOJ proposes US data-rentention law. 
This isn't clear.  The proposals I've seen call for recording "transaction data" -- i.e., the SMTP "envelope" information, plus maybe the From: line.  It does not call for retention of content.
Apart from practicality, there are constitutional issues.  Envelope data is "given" to the ISP in typical client/server email scenarios, while content is end-to-end, in that it's not processed by the ISP.  A different type of warrant is therefore needed to retrieve the latter.  The former falls under the "pen register" law (as amended by the Patriot Act), and requires a really cheap warrant.  Email content is considered a full-fledged wiretap, and requires a hard-to-get court order, with lots of notice requirements, etc.  Mandating that a third party record email in this situation, in the absence of a pre-existing
warrant citing probable cause, would be very chancy.  I don't think even the current Supreme Court would buy it.

@_subject: Re: What email encryption is actually in use? 
The primary use of STARTLS for SMTP is for mail *submission*, not relaying.  That is, when clients (like Eudora) generate mail, they submit it to an ISP or organizational SMTP server.  If this server is accessible from the Internet, it should require some sort of authentication, to avoid becoming an open spam relay.  This is sometimes done by a password over a TLS-protected session.
In other words, this isn't opportunistic encryption, and doesn't run into the problem of "random smtp server has a self-signed cert".  The client should be configured to know what cert to expect.

Regardless of whether one uses "volatile" or a pragma, the basic point remains:  cryptographic application writers have to be aware of what a clever compiler can do, so that they know to take countermeasures.

One could argue that that's because of https...
More seriously, eavesdropping on passwords was a *very* big problem starting in late 1993.  Part of the problem was that ISPs then didn't know better than to put NOC workstations on their backbone LANs; when those were compromised, the attackers had wonderfully-placed eavesdropping stations.

No, that's just not true of DNSsec.  DNSsec doesn't depend on the integrity of the connection to your DNS server; rather, the RRsets are digitally signed.  In other words, it works a lot like certificates, with a trust chain going back to a magic root key.  I'm not saying that there can't be problems with that model, but compromised DNS servers (and poisoned DNS caches) are among the major threat models it was designed to deal with.  If nothing else, the existence of caching DNS servers, which are not authoritative for the information they hand out, makes a transmission-based solution pretty useless.
