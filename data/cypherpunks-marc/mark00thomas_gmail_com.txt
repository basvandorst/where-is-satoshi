@_subject: [cryptography] Question About Best Practices for Personal File Encryption 
I have a question for the group, if I may ask it here and in this manner (?=
What are you guys using to encrypt individual files and folders or even ent=
ire drives like a USB?
I am thinking that:
1. any commercial product could be compromised and not completely secure. L=
ike Apple=92s FileVault2, which Apple has a key to.
2. It is probably open source.
3. It is probably implemented with the command line.
Am I on the right track? If so does anyone know of a helpful guide to get s=
tarted with OpenSSL on the command line besides the man pages?
