for a reason ...) and they probably will not act until Monday evening or longer (and that is at the same time when Verisign now allows "rapid" updates to zone file and could fix it very quickly). If I were Panix, I would get lawyers to draft and fax a nastygram letter to MelburneIT and somewhat similar letter to Verisign warning them of the liabilities involved in being accomplices to such a such a fraudulent and illegal actions and saying that every hour the  situation is not fixed Panix losses continue to increase and somebody would have to pay, etc...

complain loud and clear - if I remember when something like this happened
about 2-3 years ago to another bix company they fixed it in < 12 hours.
