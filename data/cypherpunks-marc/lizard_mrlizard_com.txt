Reading through the following comments, it seems unlikely. Possible, but
unlikely. The evidence, at this point, consists of an obviously anti-US
poster referring to an unnamed Professor with an unseen tape. That's
pretty low on the rely-o-meter.
I won't say it's impossible, but I want a better source.

Just as the terrorists are not representative of all Middle-Easterners,
so Fallwell and company are not representative of all Americans.

Well, she's right on one thing -- civilians will die. This is war, and
that's what happens in war. That's why, generally, we prefer to AVOID
war -- unlike some people, we don't like killing civilians.[1] But we'll
do it if we have to. Anyone who thinks we can get out of this without
massive civilian casualties is an idiot. (No, 'turning the other cheek'
is not an option. If you've once paid 'em the Danegeld, you never get
rid of the Dane.)
I don't agree with "Convert 'em to Christianity" bit. Let them remain
Muslim. Just turn them into good capitalists locked in a trading
alliance with the US, just like Germany and Japan. Global capitalism
means global peace. No one wants to bomb their customers.
[1]The terrorists could have crashed into their targets at night,
causing massive destruction but dramatically less loss of life. They
chose to cause maximum civilian death, for the purpose of causing
maximum civilian death. Civilian casualties are an inevitable
consequence of war -- only madmen make it the AIM of war.

Phill couldn't write a reply to that moron? Well, as a fan of free
speech, I hereby offer my services gratis to Mr. Zimmermann, providing
him with a useful boilerplate letter to use the next time someone claims
he is responsible for terrorist acts.
Dear (Fuckwit/Moron/Shit-For-Brains/Fundementalist)
You are accusing me of somehow helping terrorists, claiming that if PGP
did not exist, there would still be a World Trade Center. Put simply --
you're an imbecile.
Let us consider. For your accusation to be true, the
FBI/CIA/NSA/AAA/AARP/etc would have had to have been spying on a
terrorist cell, intercepting their communications, knowing they were
planning something, but unsure what due to encryption. However, the fact
is, the terrorists involved were not being monitored. Encrypted or
unencrypted, their communications never reached the various alphabet
soup agencies whose responsibility it is to harass innoc^h^h^h^h protect
democracy. As it is, these agencies are drowining in excess data, far
more than they can read or process in any reasonable span of time.
Encrypted data is lost in the bitstream. 'Backdoors' are useful only
when you already know who to listen to -- and this is more likely to be
a political opponent of the current administration than a criminal. The
spirit of J. Edgar Hoover haunts every agency in the government.
What is needed is a lot more humint and a lot less sigint. Sigint is
only useful if you know who to look at and when to watch them -- and
encryption software doesn't have anything to do with that. If you wish to be useful, stop writing hatemail proving your ignorance,
and, instead, donate blood. ALL of it. Stand over a bucket, and slit
your wrists -- up, not across. You are clearly too stupid to live. (Call
the Red Cross first so they can get it before it spoils.)
