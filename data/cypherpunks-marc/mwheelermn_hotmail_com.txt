Lack of executive sponsorship, and all that flows from that. Anyone who has heard Nationwide's "From Woe to Whoa!" presentation, or Marcy Cortes' Wells Fargo story recognize the pattern. They had their moments when they stared into the abyss, but enlightened management pulled them out.  In short, that didn't happen here.
Best regards,

After 8 1/2 months of "unplanned retirement", I am pleased to announce that I have started a new job at UnitedHealth Group, supporting z/VM and zLinux. Lots of good things happening here, and I'm working with a bunch of terrific people. Thanks for all your support over the last year. I've never been prouder to be part of the VM community.
Very best regards,
Mark Wheeler
