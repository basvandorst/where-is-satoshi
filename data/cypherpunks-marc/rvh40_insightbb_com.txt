That's right: POOR PEOPLE caused the Current Unpleasantness!  The people who pushed the Liar Loans and the alleged people who packaged those into securities and the alleged people who gave those securities AAA ratings and the alleged people who sold those AAA securities and the alleged people who bought those AAA securities and so on are completely blameless.   POOR PEOPLE caused the financial crisis!
Of course.

of the device or other user/app data on that device, and, perhaps,
that the user not even get a chance to install said malware, not
because the malware's signatures don't chain up to a trusted CA but
because the "app store" doesn't publish it and the user uses only
trusted app stores.  Neither of the last two is easy to ensure though
And yet we see things like someone (apparently) sneakernetting a thumb-drive from an infected Internet Cafe to the SIPR network: If the USG can't even keep thumb drives off of SIPR, isn't the whole game doomed to failure?   (What genius thought it would be a good idea to put USB ports on SIPR-connected boxes, anyway?)

In the US, you should tell them you're not going to talk to them without your attorney present.   That should shut them up.   Assuming they follow the law, they must stop all questioning at that point.  Assuming they make a written record of your request, anything they get from you (other than information you "volunteer") after that point should be inadmissible.  Note that there are two assumptions in this paragraph.  cryptography mailing list

There is no risk that potable water or salt or (properly maintained) rifles with ammunition will lose value.   Gold, however, you can't eat or drink and it's a real bitch to try to kill dinner with it.

I have an iPhone.
I don't discuss plans to invade Nazi Germany over it, nor do I arrange drug deals or plot the overthrow the US Government.
I think I'm pretty safe.

In a winner-take-all system like the US, third parties are irrelevant, except
insofar as they (like Bernie Sanders) caucus with one of the duopoly.
Birgitta Jonsdottir gets good press as a PP member of the Icelandic Parliament.

Is there any evidence of this?   From all appearances, they care about nothing so much as preserving and expanding their funding.
NSA surely doesn't want the publicity, but the DEA is always in search of
positive press.   If they have to listen to 100K conversations in order to bust one kid, picking up a few hundred Oxycodone pills at the Post Office,
is there any reason to suspect they wouldn't do so?
