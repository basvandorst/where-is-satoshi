Note that to compile FreeS/WAN on Red Hat using the Red Hat
kernel-source RPM you need to:
before you 'make dep'.  Otherwise you get module version

Yes, but it only takes one of the hundreds of CAs to fail to make
this check and the whole system fails.  C.f. Verisign signing a
fake MicroSoft cert last year....

I think you should specify "confidentiality" as another issue to be
addressed.  Perhaps you include confidentiality in your "privacy" or
"security" subsections, but I've found that many people think (and
mean) different things when they use these two terms.  For example, is
privacy necessarily privacy of communicated data from eavesdroppers,
or is it the privacy of personal information (perhaps the privacy of
the authentication information) so an eavesdropper does not know who
is communicating?
Unfortunately your garlic.com URL (security.htm) does not work and
returns an HTTP 404 error.
