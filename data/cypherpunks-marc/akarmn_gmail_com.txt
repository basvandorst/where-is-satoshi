That's why I'm setting up my own mail server at home. And also plan to
access it via web interface if using someone else's machine (like at
home). I would only allow web access via SSL and password, and only
show the emails of the last week (not more). Trying postfix, dovecot,
and SquirrelMail. Still in progress :)
