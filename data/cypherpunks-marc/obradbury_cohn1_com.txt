Hey...you were referred by a friend of the website. I have been emailing a couple guys from my area hoping one may be looking to hook up.  First of all my "name" is Krista.  This isn't my real name but I use it when my husband is out of town.  I'm sure I've seen you around before and I'd love to meet up.
My husband will be out of town until Dec 24th...
kisses ;-) Krista
