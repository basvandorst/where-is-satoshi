Don You may want to look at using some custom MailScanner rules for this kind of
thing. If you knew the IP range for dickinson.edu you could whitelist that
instead of the domain.
In either case I would recommend posting to the MS list

This is becomeing more and more of an issue for me.  I'm using MailScanner
4.30.3 and SpamAssassin 2.63.  I've whitelisted anything from
"dickinson.edu" so as to prevent any campus mailings from being labeled as
spam.  Now I've run into forged headers that list "xxx as the
sender and they're being whitelisted.  The attached message was interesting
in that the only place "dickinson.edu" is listed is in the
"X-MailScanner-From" line (and they chose my own address to boot).  I'm open
to suggestions here.  It hasn't happened too often but you know it'll pick
up as time goes on.  Thanks.
