You can set Mumble to TCP mode only and data and voice transmissions
will both be sent using TCP. Running my own Mumble server as a hidden
service, I got latency that was less than a second on fast circuits.

The sound quality was surprisingly clear in my tests, and I didn't have
any dropped calls, even over extended periods of time. I don't think this true at all. If you want to use torsocks and mumble

Right now there are DNS leaks when using the native proxy settings, but
it works fine with torsocks. See also:
