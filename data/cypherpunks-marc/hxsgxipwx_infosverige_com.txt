MAHWAH, N.J., May 18, 2004 (PRIMEZONE via COMTEX) --
Communications Research, Inc. (CRHI) announced that it will

huge industry event at which to make a big splash and to let
the industry know we're back with a vengeance. TeleWRITER's

quickly re-capturing former clients and rapidly developing
new sales to catapult the company."
