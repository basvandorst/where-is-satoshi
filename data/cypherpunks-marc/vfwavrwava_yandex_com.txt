I think you might be confused with this assassination market: I am running this one (which I call a lottery): But thank you for noticing improvements!
You can contribute to the pool with less than one bitcoin, any amount you like.

Not meant to be a trap, but your concerns regarding the tracability of bitcoin are correct.
There is currently no way to add to the list. I intent to make a second, much larger pool which will include 'those in congress, the presidency and the judiciary who carry the NSA's water'. And a third pool containing corporate. I am open for suggestions. I will listen to opinions about who should be on the list.

Some updates to DPL.
1) I have added a lot of names, mainly FISA court members and people from intelligence agencies.
2) I have decided not to have multiple pools but to have every name in the same death pool. Most names qualify for 75% of the pool funds, a few for 100%.
The list is not complete yet, and I would consider any suggestions that I might receive.

@_subject: DPL is closing 
DPL has been mostly unsuccessful at raising money for the cause. I did receive some generous donations, but clearly insufficient. I guess this failure is not very surprising to anyone, since I could just be another scam. Hell, I probably wouldn't donate to such an unreputable identity. I hope that the DPL listed persons will meet their due treatment, to the benefit of the societies that they supposedly represent. Due to the (understandable) lack of funding this DPL will not play a role in this. I hope that other people with more resources will bankroll the first successful prediction, after which credibility should not be an issue anymore. The remaining funds will be tumbled and directed to a charity.
