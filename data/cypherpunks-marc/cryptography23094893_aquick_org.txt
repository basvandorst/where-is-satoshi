I like Bruce Schneier's take on this:
"The idea is for me to paint this stuff on my valuables as proof of
ownership. I think a better idea would be for me to paint it on your
valuables, and then call the police."

Of course, this could just be a smokescreen to try to convince people
that they can't already do it.
The voice traffic may be hard to break, but the fact that every client
can download my entire IM history when logging into a new machine kind
of kills the "it's p2p so we can't track it" argument. Those messages
are stored somewhere.

I don't see how it would be reasonably obvious, especially if lots of
disk encryption packages started offering multiple partitions as a
transparent option. All you'd see is a bunch of random bits on the
disk and a password prompt.
They ask you for the password, you put up a fight, and then ultimately
relent and give it to them when they insist.
I don't see how you could tell the difference between a virtual 40GB
encrypted padded partition and 2 virtual 20GB ones. Many virtual disk
implementations will pre-allocate the space. Is there some reason why
filling the empty space with random garbage wouldn't mask the fact
that there were actually multiple partitions in there? There's no law
that says your empty disk space has to actually be empty. (Yet.)
I think we're talking about a straight data storage partition here. It
doesn't seem to hard to have something touch random files on a regular
basis. Regardless, that seems like a weak complaint - all you have to
do is log into the other partition once a week and use it to browse
cuteoverload or something. But, most importantly, you haven't given a good reason not to offer
this as a standard option. Maybe it wouldn't work, but maybe it

The privacy issues are troubling, of course, but it would seem trivial
to bypass this sort of compulsion by having the disk encryption
software allow multiple passwords, each of which unlocks a different
version of the encrypted partition.
When compelled to give out your password, you give out the one that
unlocks the partition full of kitten and puppy pictures, and who's to
say that's not all there is on the drive?
Is there any disk encryption software for which this is common
