============================== START ==============================
I encounter some audio problem with skype.
First, I could receive the sound from my correspondant but I could not
reply: he did not hear me. This was solved using
artsdsp -m /usr/bin/skype
Now the problems are:
1- if another audio device is working (xmms for instance), the ring tone
of an incoming call is not mixed with the music displayed.
2- if I receive a call and answer, I can no more use xmms without loging
off skype, skype doe not liberate the dsp device.
Is there a solution to these problems?
I am running FC4 with last kernel. I do not have KDE, only a few
packages (arts, k3b,...)
Thank you.

luca porcu a Ã©crit :
in tools-->options-->sound-devices ALSA (the other option is OSS)
in xmms output plugin is ALSA 1.2.10 (libALSA.so)
        device audio is hw 0,0 (options are : default or hw 0,4 this
last not working)
And I have still the same message: dmix: unable to open slave.
Mine is:
# Generated by system-config-soundcard, do not edit by hand
defaults.pcm.card 0
defaults.pcm.card 0
But I have another PC with same /etc/asound.conf as yours, and I'm
unable to get xmms and skype at the same time....

In that case, it doesn't work! What is your /etc/asound.conf ?

I tried this in my .asoundrc:
pcm.!card0 {
        type plug
        slave.pcm "dmixer"
        }
pcm.dmixer  {
        type dmix
        ipc_key 1024
        slave {
            pcm "hw:1,0"
            period_time 0
            period_size 1024
            buffer_size 4096
            rate 44100
                }
        bindings {
            0 0
            1 1
                }
        }
ctl.dmixer {
        type hw
        card 0
        }
And it seems to work (just simple tests made). Maybe there is a better
solution? I don't know much about ALSA.

Thanks. It works now without artsdsp.
But still remains the problem of two sound devices at the same time.
With both spype and xmms using ALSA:
when I try to call with skype, I get this message:
ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:832:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave
And, after that, skype is dead: I have to kill it with killall.
Moreover I'm seen as out of line.
The best is xmms using ALSA and skype OSS, but when xmms is working I'm
unable to call (audio I/O error); in that case skype stay alive and I
can see (popup) that someone is calling me and no ring tone mixed with
