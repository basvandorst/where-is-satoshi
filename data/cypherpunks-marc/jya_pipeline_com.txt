Yes, Sandy, how do you do that? Sincerely, I'm not being
a wiseass. Some building types have disappeared over
time due to understanding that they don't work any more.
Glorious buildings that once were once seen as absolutely the
best ever. Forts, for example. Gothic cathedrals that failed after exceeding the limits of stone construction.
High rise engineers now admittedly design to the limits of failure under economic pressure and aesthetic ambition.
One of the best high-rise structural engineers in the world,
often consulted after failures, says that it cannot be known
for sure all the forces that a super-high-rise will face, even
with the best supercomputer modeling (though not at the
capability of Nat Lab nuclear similuations) for each is unique, often purposely unique, that each is an experiment,
and there is no testing laboratory except the building itself.
Most mid- and super-high-rises require remedial work
almost immediately, some even during construction, and
sensors are now always installed to provide feedback on
what the modeling says cannot be foretold with certainty.
Those which have undergone remediation in NYC that
I know about are numerous, and most of that has been
kept under wraps with NDAs of those designing the
corrections, to protect property values as well as
reputations and to fend off lawsuits.
The New Yorker a few years ago published one of the
few accounts not in technical journals about high-rise
remediation, in this case about CitiCorp's middling-rise, telling of the years-long attempt to avoid culpability not only by the original structural engineer but by a host of other prominents involved, despite repeated damning studies funded by occupant-leaseholders who could hear the building pop and creak, feel movement and see cracked interior walls.
No big deal, perhaps, for unique large architectural and civil
structures behave in unexpected ways, having no unique
precedent to learn from. The safest high-rises are those
that copy successes, and the successes are few for
super-high-rises, not many are built.
Ok, daring is needed, that is the architect's drug of choice
and sale, but recall the building code of Vitruvius: commodity, firmness and delight. The architectural delight drug needs the other two or why bother building at all, just take a pill. The skyscraper bounty of which is in short supply downtown these days. No matter, it will come raging back like a bull on Monday, or will that market crash too.

Reasonable humans should not work or live in them. Cutting edge idiots should, but few do, especially their builders who know exactly what the hazard is, though they may put staff there for marketing the illusions of safety. Eiffel spent time in his tower to assure the skeptical

However, no building, high or low, if not a bunker under a mountain, can be constructed to be bomb-proof. DoD said this yesterday in a damage assessment of the Pentagon. As with renovation there, blast-resistant

The New Yorker, October 29, 2001:
  "In recent weeks an ilite Pentagon undercover unit -- trained to slip into foreign countries and find suspected nuclear weapons, and disarm them if necessary -- has explored plans for an operation inside Pakistan. In 1998, Pakistan successfully tested a nuclear device, heralded as the Islamic world's first atomic bomb. According to United States government estimates, Pakistan now has at least twenty-four warheads, which can be delivered by intermediate-range missiles and a fleet of F-16 aircraft.
Some of the government's most experienced South Asia experts have doubts about Musharraf's ability to maintain control over the military and its nuclear arsenal in the event of a coup; there are also fears that a dissident group of fundamentalist officers might try to seize a warhead. The Army and the influential Inter-Services Intelligence, or I.S.I., have long-standing religious and personal ties to many of the leaders of the Taliban, dating back to Afghanistan's war against the Soviet Union in the nineteen-eighties, when Pakistan was the main conduit for American support.

PENTAGON SEEKS IDEAS ON COMBATING TERRORISM
The Department of Defense announced today that the Under
Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics
and the Combating Terrorism Technology Support Office Technical
Support Working Group are jointly sponsoring a Broad Agency
Announcement (BAA) asking for help in fighting terrorism.
The BAA, issued Oct. 23 (No. 02-Q-4655), specifically seeks help
in combating terrorism, defeating difficult targets, conducting
protracted operations in remote areas, and developing
countermeasures to weapons of mass destruction.  Its objective
is to find concepts that can be developed and fielded within 12
to 18 months.
The BAA provides for a three-phase process in which interested
parties initially submit a one-page description of their
concept.  Initial responses are due by Dec. 23, 2001.  After a
review of a submission and if DoD is interested in further
information, the submitter will then be asked to provide a more
detailed description of up to 12 pages of the idea.  Submitters
of concepts that the department is not interested in pursuing
further will be so notified.
DoD will evaluate phase two submissions and ask those who have
offered the most promising ideas to submit full proposals in a
third phase that may form the basis for a contract.  Phase two
submitters who are not asked to submit full proposals will be so
notified.  Submitters of a full phase three proposal that is not
accepted by the department may request a formal debriefing.
Debriefings will not be provided to phase one and phase two
submitters whose concepts were not accepted.

That was the initial perception. The NY Times had a report

within ten minutes of the crash. The pilot said the smoke was blowing away from Tower 1 (the first hit) so there was a fair sized refuge for people to stand in any had accessed the roof. A thicket of antennas would have prevented landing but the pilot said there was a hoist onboard with a 200 foot cable capable of picking up people. A colleague was ready to descend to the roof to assist. Nobody came to the roof.
Another chopper hovered nearby to do the same. Other choppers
were on their way from Long Island but flights were cancelled
when it was reported nobody was on the roof.
The pilot said it was possible that at least a dozen or so
people could have been rescued before the collapse.
The pilot said at the 1993 bombing a cop was lowered to
cut away a wad of antennas so roof pickups could be made,

chopper rescue is too high risk and that exit by stairway is far safer. But in the light of WTC collapse fire departments are reviewing that prohibition.

@_subject: War Criminals 
Paul Krugman, Economic Columnist, New York Times, 24 October 2001:
At worst, war bonds will offer a lower return than ordinary bonds. And if some people buy them nonetheless, what will they finance? Here's where that tax bill enters the picture. The remarkable thing about the 'stimulus' package that passed the Ways and Means Committee on a straight party-line vote is that it barely even pretends to serve its ostensible function. It consists largely of permanent tax cuts, not the temporary cuts that you would expect in a stimulus package. It systematically gives money to those least likely to spend it, that is, to high-income taxpayers, and above all to large corporations. Some of the provisions in the House bill are simply mind-boggling. For example, there is a large *retroactive* tax cut for corporations that would lead to immediate rebates of hundreds of millions of dollars to *each* of a select list of giant companies, many of them in the energy industry (though the $1.4 billion check to I.B.M. would top the list). On the other hand, there is almost nothing in the bill for people who might actually need more money. The extra unemployment benefits, in particular, are far less generous than those offered in the last recession, when the elder Bush was president. The bill, in short, looks as if it was written by corporate lobbyists -- and it probably was. Even Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill was evidently embarrassed by the bill, dismissing its more outlandish components as 'show business' designed to impress campaign But his remark was naove. Those lobbyists are serious men, who are paid by their employers to deliver results, not gestures; they wouldn't have put those provisions in unless they thought they had enough power to get them enacted. And sure enough, the White House soon contradicted Mr. O'Neill; the president, declared Ari Fleischer, was 'very pleased' with the House bill. Which brings us back to those war bonds. The government not only isn't calling for shared sacrifice; it is 'very pleased' with a proposal to give billions in handouts to corporations. And in that case, what is someone who buys a war bond really helping to finance? Put it this way: If the House has its way, the government will give far more in tax breaks to corporations over the next year than it will spend fighting terrorism. Yet somehow one suspects that people would not rush to buy 'corporate tax-cut bonds.'

The Wall Street Journal of October 18 quoted portions of Congressional
testimony by Ken Alibek, former top Russian biowar researcher, as
saying that of the five main purposes for developing anthrax as a
weapon, the least importnat purpose was injuring or killing people. The most important purpose was to create terror and panic.
Alibek was reported to have said that anthrax was not that dangerous,
that it took a substantial dose to cause injury and more to kill, that
even crop-dusting Washington DC with weapons grade stuff would
not kill the huge numbers alleged.
But that lack of effectiveness was not what was to be publicized, he said, instead development of the anthrax attack system included massive disinformation about its lethality before all else. In short,
anthrax is primarily psywar (as is most NBCI WMD).
Richard Preston is his two New Yorker articles* a while back heavily

@_subject: Re: WTC Collapse Alternative 
It would not take a lot of explosives to breakaway an entire floor
constructed with steel joists like WTC; it is often done in planned demolitions with a small charge placed at each joist support --
customarily a shelf angle either continuous or segmented.
What would do it though without explosives is the twisting torque and vertical flexing in the tower tubes caused by an aircraft hitting off center of the tower's axis at 300 mph. Survivors tell of the tower swaying several feet, but they are not likely to have perceived the torque as such. The hit on the South Tower (the second hit) was more off center than that on the North Tower.
Tall buildings are designed with some torque resistance against
turbulent weather and earthquake but probably not for torque coupled with high impact. The WTC towers were made of two tubes, the exterior wall system (the more flexible) and the interior core (the more rigid), the two tubes connected by light-weight floor structures and at about 1/3 intervals, heavy-weight transfer and mechanical equipment From examining the wreckage the steel floor joists rested on shelf
angles welded to vertical supports. These angles are designed to
support vertical loads not much twisting.
The joists could have lost their support by tower twisting of no more than a few inches, the shelf angle welding beads popping, or the joists slipping off the angles that did not break loose (as photos
show many did not).
If the floor slab concrete was not reinforced it would have crumbled
easily under torque. Again, most building structure is designed to
resist vertical loading not substantial twisting. (Structural connections are designed to resist relatively minor twisting caused by static
and dynamic loading.)
There is a valid question of why the buildings did not collapse immediately if floor structures were damaged and serial pancaking set in motion.
The raging fires surely contributed to further weakening of the
building structure, but probably due to adverse effect on floor structures
and in particular on the light-weight shelf-angle welded connections between the floor system and the heavy-weight vertical supports.
It is at these connections that demolition designers place light-weight
charges, as well as heavy-weight cutting charges on vertical supports.
For comparison, a WTC shelf angle may be 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick welded with a bead about the same while a vertical columnon WTC could average 2-3 inches thick, increasing in thickness from top to
The WTC designers claim the buildings were capable of withstanding
a 727 hit, asserted at original building and after the 1993 bombing.
But the design criteria for that protection have not been published
so it cannot be determined what crash scenario was used for design.

What is odd about the WTC debris is how few larger fragments of concrete it contains. Reports on the structure say reinforced concrete was used for floor slabs and customarily in demolition such material breaks apart in relatively large chunks, the broken concrete remaining attached by steel reinforcing bars or wire mesh. However, there is a structural design where plain concrete is placed on metal floor decking with little or no reinforcing. Also, lightweight concrete, whose course aggregate is cinder rather than stone, is often used to limit the weight of the structure, especially
in high-rise building. This lightweight material does not usually have the strength of regular concrete and strength is provided by metal decking below it. The large amount of dust produced by the towers' collapse and the relative lack of larger concrete shards raise the possibility that the building disintegrated at least in part due to lesser strength of the type of concrete used in the floors. That remains to be examined.
Observation of the towers' remains show that while main steel vertical structural members of the exterior wall and central core withstood the collapse, the horizontal floor-supporting trusses broke away from these vertical supports at the points of attachment (probably made by welding). One view of the North Tower (1 WTC) shows the exterior and core remnants and the ruptured points
of floor structure attachment. Photos:         What this suggests is the possibility that the structure of each floor collapsed due to load of collapsing floors above them, and that only afterwards did the vertical supports at the exterior and core collapse. Review of video of the collapse appears to confirm this sequence as well as the consequent supposition that the floor structure was the weakest part of the buildings

Has anyone seen one of the full messages from the source
of the meeting story other than Tony Smith, me and one other
party which was cc'ed on mine? That's not to say Tony got the one I got -- he has not answered my inquiry to him yesterday.
There are fascinating parts of my message that haven't come
to light -- yet. We'll publish all the messages with the tracking
headers we've got it if we can prove the information is false. Which Tony Smith didn't do beyond being, apparently, buffaloed by disclaimers that are standard smoke for shenanigans, at least as far as his retraction went. Could be he's blowing smoke to cover his own looking more closely at the matter.
Hal's Finney's critique was pretty good, but I assume it was
based on the information that has been made public. Tony Smith
didn't report stuff in the message I got, again not that we
got the same message. Nor did he report the results of a
follow-up from his source if he asked for it.
What we have done with a bit of technical tracking and matching
time data is get within one or two boxes of the source, ID'ed an unusual browser type, the operating system, some other yadda log file stuff.
Fingering the source is the last thing to do, and then only if the
episode was rigged by RIAA or other alleged attendees.
No need to beat up on Smith, there are so many blandly
verifiable stories published that it's refreshing to see one that
remains disputably interesting.  Sorry to see his retraction
just when the topic gets interesting.  Hope he digs up more

From 14 users of Safeweb scattered around the US and several overseas, the same range of IP addresses
were used. Which makes sense if all users logged into
the same Safeweb home page and from there logged
onto Cryptome. A few users logged in from their own

If you would like to ping Safeweb we would appreciate getting

@_subject: Tracking the RIAA Source 
Thanks to help from a person here we have developed a
likely source for the RIAA meeting messages, and at the
moment it appears likely Safeweb was used to send the messages as well as check on the Cryptome file.
Safeweb appears to dynamically assign addresses to users,
though within a limited range which might be set by the location
of the user, but we are not sure of that. Indeed, if Safeweb
does not cloak location by avoiding a predictable range that
would be a serious weakness. But we need to test that.
Safeweb is, at least in part, hosted by the giant ISP Abovenet,
home-based in San Jose, CA, with facilities all around the
US and overseas. To help us triangulate a likely location
from which the messages were sent we need to log accesses
to Cryptome from a variety of US and overseas locations.
For example I get the same range of addresses as those of the RIAA messages and file accesses by logging in from New York
City to Safeweb.com then using Safeweb to request a Cryptome file. What I don't know is whether those same addresses would
be used from other physical locations around the world.
For anybody who wants to risk giving away their own location
I ask that accesses be made from the Safeweb.com from any location in the world to a fictitious file on Cryptome:
  Replace xxxxxxx with a clue to your location, say, texas, germany,
whereever I could identify.
The request will generate an error code and an originating address
from Safeweb which I can use to compare to what I've got for
the RIAA messages and for NYC. Presumably Safeweb will cloak
your actual IP address.
Let me emphasize that I do not yet believe the source was
perpetrating a hoax, or if so whether the hoax was run to
benefit RIAA which is the current outcome. My intention is not to out the source if the leak is legitimate, but I damn well want to broadcast it if RIAA, its friends or a TLA cooked up the ruse.
Declan has jumped the gun on assigning blame here, apparently
doing little more checking than Tony Smith. But hell that

Based some three dozen pings of Safeweb IP address 64.124.150.130
from locations in the US and overseas, all pings conclude with these
5 or 6 hops:
  lga1-lhr3-stm64.lga1.above.net (64.125.31.182)  (New York, NY)
  core2-lga1-oc192.lga2.above.net (208.184.232.198)  (New York, NY)
  main1colo45-core2-oc48.lga2.above.net (216.200.127.174)  (New York, NY)
About half the pings timed out before the last hop at:
  208.184.48.173.safeweb.com (San Jose, CA)
A few hit a "private" address after 208.184.48.173:
  10.100.0.2 (no location)
before ending at:
  64.124.150.130.safeweb.com (San Jose, CA)
The station locations were provided by trace route program
Interpretation is needed for:
1. How much about the Safeweb stations is true and how much cloaking.
2. Why some pings timed out and others didn't.
3. Phantom station 10.100.0.2
4. Whether the San Jose hops actually go to San Jose or are spoofed.
5. Why go to New York then hop across the continent unless the
last hops are just administrative not physical.
6. How is cloaking done on addresses and physical locations
Is cloaking done by a Safeweb program, say by address spoofer or by phantom proxies, or is there a way to do this by special agreement with Network Central (whatever that is), say, as Intel Web and other classified systems covertly use the Web.
Recall that Safeweb was selected for financial support by the
CIA so intel officers could use it to cloak their Net use. And other
programs such as Onion make use of sub-Net features not easily
available to the surface user.
Now, onto news of the RIAA leaker (not yet a proven hoaxer despite
Declan, RIAA and friends hoaxing that).
We received a third message yesterday from the alleged source of the RIAA allegations who was pissed at our attempts to trace
the source. Use of Safeweb was admitted. Angry words were
hurled at us. Allegations were made that parties have been
punished for the leak though not the leaker who fears that
information about the traces could be used for that. Here's
our response:
October 11, 2001
I very much appreciate your concern. I have stated publicly
that I do not yet believe there has been a hoax and that the source of the messages will not be disclosed if the messages can be shown to be legitimate.  Not that I have any hard information
on who you are. And don't need to know who you are so long
as your information is reliable. Hell, it doesn't have to be reliable
just provocative and unsettling.
Right now there is a push on by a host of people to promote that the messages are a hoax, and if they prevail RIAA will be the main beneficiary. And a great story becomes a bore.
It is to head off that win by RIAA, to avoid giving them improved
protection against future abuses as a result of the alleged hoax, that I wish to get from you information that will demonstrate there was no hoax. Again without putting you in jeopardy.
In a tough fight like this RIAA and its supporters will do whatever
they can to smear and deny your revelations. That's the
way it is, so fighting back is the only answer to prevent an
RIAA win by default as result of your valiant effort.
Listen, this very thing happens every time we put up a
controversial document, and your protection is paramount,
but opponents of publication will fight like hell to deny
the truth. But you surely know that. Now is when the
going gets tough. You need to decide how to avoid losing
this battle, losing your reputation and the whole shebang.
I say come forth with proof of the meeting and comments
made, provide it through a secure channel to protect your
identity. But don't let this story die a useless death.
Tony Smith ducked and ran. Not here, the story stays on
Cryptome, along with the story of what happened after
your account was published. Disinformation is as good
as information, maybe better. But if you want to abandon what you started, I'll understand
and wait for the next opportunity to buck the fuckers.

Thanks to SC:
[SC's IP address replaced by xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx]
I've tuned in late to the riaa/safeweb thing, but I'm chiming in with my bit.
Tracing from safeweb is an interesting exercise; the geography is
very typical of the internet backbone and the router hops packets
I wrote a script to mail all possible headers from a connecting
browser to myself. I installed it on my server
   and then connected from Safeweb. This anonymizer uses a caching proxy server, listening for
connections on several IPs; it preserves client headers while
obviously changing the IP of the originating connection; it preserves
many of the originating headers; it adds some new headers. Here's the output:
DATE_LOCAL..........Saturday, 13-Oct-2001 01:22:45 EDT
HTTP_ACCEPT..........image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg,
image/pjpeg, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint, application/vnd.ms-excel,
application/msword, */*
HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE..........Sat, 13 Oct 2001 05:15:44 GMT;
DATE_GMT..........Saturday, 13-Oct-2001 05:22:45 GMT
HTTP_USER_AGENT..........Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows
NT 5.0)
HTTP_VIA..........1.0 anongo.com:3128 (Squid/2.3.STABLE3)
The last one in the list is the flavour of proxy they use:
  Squid/2.3.stable3
And the DNS name of the source box for the HTTP request
is anongo.com, which I don't believe showed up in your trace logs. Basically a caching proxy server's header set.
The authoritative name servers for anongo.com are   ns3.above.net
 redirects to Safeweb. The boxes are standard
unix/apache with ssl. They have written scripts to replace the
originating address header and keep track of the connection, receive
requested files to their cache, and then serve from that cache to
your browser.
The machines would absolutely be configured to do sophisticated
logging; there is no free lunch on the net. While they appear to do a
nice job, their server logs would be a goldmine. Everyone who uses a
commercial web browser agrees to have their information gathered the
first time they use that browser - do you want to continue? When you
say yes, you mean it!

Johnson and "Assassination Politics." The article
cited three sources on the DoJ web site, two of which

Jessica Stern, a Harvard wahoo expert, who has

Continuing to beat the drum, today's Wall Street Journal
offers two essays on how much liberty to give up for safety.
One, an Op-Ed by a historian, recounts how in the past the United States Presidents have imposed draconian wartime draconian security measures and trashed civil liberties far
more than anything currently contemplated, naming Adams, Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, among others. But claims that after the crises passed civil liberties were restored "stronger than ever." So fear not what is in the offing.
The second, by a WSJ columnist, argues that enough is
too much, that the Bush Administration halt curtailment
of civil liberties, and that the sunset provisions of current anti-terrorism proposals are a good thing. These wafflings are diabolical apologies for what Bush
coupers are up to, offerings of amelioration to disarm
critics. Woolsey, Stew Baker, Bork, the WSJ, the host of oilers

This is a worthy topic for those who may soon be in the

Some accounts say that a fair number of the detainees are

not only by the guards but by magistrates and the US Attorney's
Defense attorneys are kept on a very, very short lease despite
complaints of unfair treatment of their clients and themselves.
These procedures were described in exquisite detail during
the USA v. bin Laden et al trial earlier this year:
  Use the search on Cryptome to find the transcripts describing
the comb attack.
The harsh treatment appears to have been the cause of one
prisoner attacking a guard (reputedly a soft-heart) with a sharpened comb, blinding the man in both eyes and causing permanent brain damage. The treatment then got worse, and likely continues for new detainees.
In the case of the deceased Pakistani in New Jersey's Hudson
County jail: that pen is well-known for its brutal treatment of
non-Mafia prisoners, especially if they are colored any shade other than vomit, and the Paki may have been taken out by the
guards and or other prisoners in patriotic fervor, or just as a result of the usual racist sadism.
Most federal, state and city jail guards hereabouts are about the same quality as airport security personnel, and get their kicks abusing prisoners, lying about it, and getting winked at
by judges and prosecutors. 24 x 7 tapes regularly disappear
in case of an incident.

hostages of US Attorney Mary Jo White and the New York
office of the FBI. The two offices are pissed that Ashcroft is
trying to take over the long-lived terrorism investigation without
properly rewarding those who have been running it. Some of
the New York attorneys and investigators have been reassigned
to DC but don't like the way they are being treated -- no doubt
in part due to different party affiliations, but more likely because
the Bush newcomers don't want to be condescended to by the New Yorkers who hate DC, its crud food, people and gossip.
New York and DC, Justice and FBI, have been at it for decades,
and this long-running vendetta is what underlies several
espionage cases, including Hansen's, but not only his. DC
sends people up to New York to counterspy on the operations, but they either get coopted or if uncooperative get fucked by being set up to take a fall. Various countries like Russia help out their New York buddies in screwing the competition. And
the reverse happens in DC to New Yorkers who are sucked
into that cesspool.
When the Soviets in New York battled the Soviets in DC,
both using their USG resources, and the USG doing the
same, it was war beyond ordinary counterintelligence comprehension. These battles have been going on since
the 1930s, and were set in motion by Hoover and his
Soviet counterpart. Then became institutionalized

There's a USG-mafia in New York that is far more complex than the organized crime kind, though there is cooperation with

repeatedly repaint.) The gaggle of antennas the agencies use there nicely fit in
among the TV antennas of the cooking show. The feds and

Local reports of eyewitnesses say an engine came off first,
and landed separately from the plane. The plane came in
"flat," not nosediving, thus perhaps somewhat under the pilot's control. Plane was zigzagging before it crashed.
The A300 can be landed without power, thus stable with
both engines gone. The engine that came off could have
caused destablization.
No evidence of an attack. However, terrorist games often
include scenarios of an ground to air attack on planes
leaving Kennedy as they pass over the lightly populated
areas of Queens (a lot of open water and marshlands).
No eyewitness accounts of missile tracks. One witness

Aren't these kind of rigs used to survey, triangulate and record
large numbers of ground-based transceivers?
If so, they are similar to rigs which do geological surveys
with packs of machines you can see traversing likely oil
reserves. Odd looking, six or so trucks, bumper to bumper,
running 50 yards or so, pausing, an almost inaudible hammering on the ground, then rushing ahead to the
next stop. Logs of these soundings are reportedly
transmitted directly to home base, encrypted, so the
trucks cannot be hijacked or intercepted by competitors.
So the wishful thinking goes.
In the case of aerial surveys of radio frequencies, it is
possible to spoof signals by tucking the genuine in amongst
"static." But successful evasion depends on the snoopers
not have quick-witted algorithms to snatch the static,
even if it's burst transceivals, and make sense of it.
If you encrypt the sneaky signal you're dead meat.
Again, learning from the oil patch pirates, you can lay off
over the horizon and grab the sounding data by reading
the ground signal in the clear not the encrypted air data. But beware of chaff sent out by the trucks to thwart that such angle snooping.
Some packs of trucks are reconnaissance by fire.
As are some of the aerial surveys, which invite
tracking of the overt apparatus to snatch the pirates'
interceptions by way of reverse engineering the
snoop with an array so large you wouldn't know it
was there unless you had an antenna capable of
reading it. Some locate components of the
secondary receiver city-wide, or maybe wider.
Some radio engineers think the mobile phone system
transceivers are used for that very, very wide array purpose tucked dual-use below the consumer usage.
Would mobile phones also serve as unwitting contributors to a large area transceiver? Sophicticated geological sensors can certainly get pretty good readings from heavy traffic
on the interstate, and it gets better as the highways
deteriorate. Concrete expansion joints are wondrous

How would the LME work on the interior structure of the plane?
The skin has little structural strength but does streamline the
structure and I suppose if it was weakened to peel away,
turbulence could shear structural bolts or welds. The tail section
of 587 appeared to be cleanly detached from the fuselage and
not obviously torn.
Vibration of the tail could have loosened or fractured bolts or welds
sufficiently to break away under the forces of take-off and/or
turbulence from the preceding 747.
Still, if the tail was subject to vibration that would have made its
attachments a likely assembly to check frequently.
Several recent FAA airworthiness directives for the A300 listed problems needing attention but nothing on the tail assembly.
Which doesn't mean squat necessarily, since expected accidents usually don't happen.
However, because tails seldom come loose, I understand, if an
attacker wanted to do the unexpected on a part little suspected
of failure, the tail connection would be a good target. One pilot
was quoted as saying no better failure could have been arranged to assure disaster. That is, loss of tail is not in featured
the emergency recovery manual -- at least in civilian aircraft.
I believe loss of tail is included in military emergency planning
due to their being good vertical targets for missiles, shells and
shrapnel. Some military tails are oversized for the plane to
survive loss of a good portion of the tail (although not likely
for entire tail loss except for two-tailed craft).

there's little to stop someone from posting the latest blockbuster

be deciphered in the embassy buildings themselves, greatly
reducing the risk of interception.

that people have a right to know how to protect themselves
against biological attack, especially the "accidental" kind.
The Connecticut victim of anthrax lived due west of Plum
Island, which is located off the coast of Long Island, and
is a controversial laboratory which does classified research
on animal diseases. Locals have protested for years about
its activities. One favorite complaint is that wild animals on
the island get infected and then swim across Long Island
Sound to Connecticut or across an narrow inlet to the
LI mainland. Deers swim the sound; rodents, squirrels and rabbits swim the inlet; and birds fly everywhere up and
down the coast and inland. The laboratory's officials claim there is no threat to
the public, that their research only involves foot and mouth
disease. Nobody believes that for infected deer have turned
up in CT and small mammals and birds on Long Island.
I've not seen any mention of Plum Island in connection
with the anthrax case, and mammals usually are not a source
of the inhalation type, but could be transporters of the powder. Still, it would not be surprising that Plum has been doing research with a variety of animal-borne diseases for that is what it was set up to do several decades ago. Critics have questioned why the laboratory has been allowed
to continue to operate within the New York Megalopolis. But
the same is said of Brookhaven National Laboratory, located
not far away.

Microsoft's patent for a Digital Rights Management
Operating System was awarded yesterday:
  A digital rights management operating system protects rights-managed data, such as downloaded content, from access by untrusted programs while the data is loaded into memory or on a page file as a result of the execution of a trusted application that accesses the memory. To protect the rights-managed data resident in memory, the digital rights management operating system refuses to load an untrusted program into memory while the trusted application is executing or removes the data from memory before loading the untrusted program. If the untrusted program executes at the operating system level, such as a debugger, the digital rights management operating system renounces a trusted identity created for it by the computer processor when the computer was booted. To protect the rights-managed data on the page file, the digital rights management operating system prohibits raw access to the page file, or erases the data from the page file before allowing such access. Alternatively, the digital rights management operating system can encrypt the rights-managed data prior to writing it to the page file. The digital rights management operating system also limits the functions the user can perform on the rights-managed data and the trusted application, and can provide a trusted clock used in place of the standard computer clock.

Whatever promise AP has for its avowed purpose, so far it
has helped to jail a couple of guys and smear a few more

Talking about AP in public is still going on, here and elsewhere.
Disagreeing about it too. Take it seriously or as a joke, take
your pick. Nothing in the essay proves it's serious or a joke.
Its quality appears to be determined by the credulity of the

about this forum too. The thrill continues, trying to figure out
who is serious and how is joking and who is laying the traps. The more serious posts here are the best, but mattd is coming
on swell for a standoff comic. True that not everyone likes the humor of political agitation,
and prefer a somber aping of the pols and mils and edus
flogging non-fictional aspirations to right what's wrong,
delusional ravings presented as insight.
Jim Bell would have made AP an underground comedy if he
had hung out with the time-wasterists at MIT rather than with

potboiler succeeds by making a comical wrong turn into the
pokey, not once but twice, and inspiring CJ to follow,

What is peculiar is that the non-bin Laden parts of the tape
are superior quality, with close up zooms and other adjustments
for quality. The portions which show UBL are consistently poorer
than the rest, and show little adjustment for quality. Hard to know
if that difference is in the original or was due to later doctoring.
Any video wizards to comment on the likelihood of different
video operators or was it tape from two different machines
spliced together?
Eric Margolis, a reporter and commentator just now on Wolf Blitzer's CNN show pointed out that the tape allegedly came from the Northern Alliance, that the Alliance is very close to Russian intelligence, and that the Russians are masters at forging documents and evidence of all sorts.
Margolis went on to say that every good reporter is suspicious
of "Christmas gifts" like the tape which appear at just the
right time in a convenient finding place.
Blitzer's other two guests, a Saudi representative, and a
reporter for the LA Times, were not suspicious of the tape.
Me, I agree with our Cherry Tree President that no patriot not a pedophile or an African-American on death row in Texas, would ever doubt the tape's authenticity. However, I deeply respect that the Prez crossed his eyes while lisping
the raspberry. Crossed more than usual. And the smirk
of the Prez when he talks about beheading bin Laden is
right out of the video. The smirk that never goes away

NONCOMPLIANCE SUMMARY
The probation officer believes that Carl Edward Johnson has violated conditions of supervision by:
Violation Number      Nature of Noncompliance
  1.        Failing to report the names and addresses of two             Internet service providers, in violation of a             special condition of supervision.
  2.        Using the Internet to access the "Cypherpunk"             website after being specifically instructed not             to use the Internet for this purpose, in violation             of standard condition number 3.
U.S. Probation Officer Action; On October 18, 2001, this officer received intelligence
information which indicated Mr. Johnson was accessing the Internet using two Internet accounts which had not been provided to this officer. Mr.Johnson was using these accounts to insert himself back into a "Cypherpunk" web site he had been accessing during the instant offense. During the probation intake with Mr. Johnson on August 20, 2001, he was instructed to use the Internet for the purpose of researching his medical condition and legal matters only, He was specifically instructed not to access
the Cypherpunk website.
Of particular concern was the content of Mr. Johnson's e-mails, which contained derogatory comments about federal officials. On October 22, 2001, this officer, along with the investigating agent in this matter, conducted an unannounced home visit at Mr. Johnson's residence. Mr. Johnson was asked if he had
provided this officer with all Internet accounts he was currently using, to which he stated he had two new accounts he forgot to report to this officer. He accurately provided the account addresses and stated he would not forget in the future. Mr. Johnson was questioned in regard to his recent postings to the Cypherpunk website after being instructed by this officer not to use the Internet for this purpose. Mr. Johnson became highly agitated at this point, yelling obscenities and banging his fists on the table. After he calmed down, however, Mr. Johnson stated he misunderstood and did not realize he was restricted from going into this site. He further explained that his messages, in regard to federal officials, were simply commentaries to other people's messages. Mr. Johnson was reprimanded for the inappropriate nature
of his e-mail messages and again specifically directed not to access the Cypherpunk website or make any postings to that site. It is noted that a thorough inspection of Mr. Johnson's residence was conducted during this home visit which did not yield anything The Probation Office is giving Mr. Johnson the benefit of the doubt when he says he misunderstood this officer's instructions. We will continue to monitor him closely, and are recommending that no further action be taken at this time. Should Mr. Johnson's noncompliant behavior continue, the Court will be immediately notified and further sanctions will be requested.

@_subject: CIA in NYC 
The report a while back in the NY Times on the secret
CIA station located in 7 World Trade Center, claimed
its primary role was to surveil UN members and staff.
And its cover was the Secret Service office in the
building (which also housed NYC's Emergency
Couple of things on that. The building, which was only
a few years old, is reported to have collapsed due to
high heat of oil storage tanks, a small tank on the upper
floor to serve NYC Emergency Operations, and an
unsually large tank in the basement. The building owner,
Larry Silverstein, who leased the WTC towers, says
the basement tank was for emergency power. Period.
However, while many buildings have emergency power
systems, few have the size of tanks in 7 WTC. Which may
indicate that the building housed a variety of operations
needing uninterruptable power, and which, in turn, could
explain why NYC put its emergency operations center
there despite public ridicule for putting it on a high floor,
of a glass walled building, next to a likely terrorist
Moreover, it is unlikely that the purpose of the CIA station
was only that made public to the Times. More likely is
that the public story is a cover for what the station did.
One possibility is that it engaged in communication
interceptions, if not transmissions to agents as well, and could have made use of the antennas atop WTC 1, or antennas cloaked by the public antennas.
Now whether bin Laden, or whoever planned the attack,
knew of this, or suspected it, could enrich the speculation
about why the towers were targeted.
Certainly it would take no comsec genius to perform
analysis of what was coming and going atop the towers,
or that may have been going on under cover of the
tower's emissions. All the public emissions could have
been discounted and the remainder subject to detailed
Perhaps the ordinary mujahadeen couldn't do that kind
of analysis but certainly a slew of other nations could.
As well as private comsec companies, of which there
are dozens in NYC peddling their services to US and
foreign clients.
So, if the CIA was surveilling these private security
companies, along with the comms of the UN members,
it may well be that countersurveillance picked up the
snoops and the information was peddled to assassins
or used to justify engaging hit squads to take out the
Finally, oil storage tanks are required by building and
fire codes to have especially durable fire-proofed enclosures,
the design based on the size of the tank and any expected
worse case scenario. At least this is the case when a
facility is subject to municipal regulations. Which we know the WTC was not. Whether the Center's unusual
vulnerability attacted the attack is a fair question.
But don't expect any findings to be made public is this
is the case, for that might require delving into which
operations in the Center invited retaliation by those
who had been attacked by them.

@_subject: MS DRM OS Begets SSSCA 
SSSCA is far from dead, it may have a good chance
of enactment according to Mike Godwin's essay today,
"Coming Soon: Hollywood Versus the Internet:"
  Here are his opening paragraphs:
"If you have a fast computer and a fast connection to the Internet, you make Hollywood nervous. And Tinseltown is nervous not because of what you're doing now, but because of what you *might* do -- grab digital Hollywood content
with your computer and broadcast it over the Internet.
Which is why Hollywood, along with other content companies, from book publishers to the music industry, has begun a
campaign to stop you from ever being able to do such a thing -- even though you may have no intention of becoming a copyright "pirate." That campaign has pitted corporate giants like Disney and Fox against corporate giants like Microsoft and IBM, but the resulting war over the shape of future digital technology may end up with us computer
users suffering the "collateral damage."
As music-software designer and entrepreneur Selene Makarios puts it, this campaign represents "little less than an attempt to outlaw general-purpose computers."
Let's get one thing straight -- when I say there's war looming in cyberspace over copyright, I'm not talking about the struggle between copyright holders and copyright "pirates" who distribute unlicensed copies of creative works for free over the Internet. Maybe you loved Napster or maybe you hated it, but the right to start a Napster, or to infringe copyright and get away with it, is not what's at issue here. And in a sense it's a distraction from what the real war is.
What I'm talking about instead is the war between the content industries (call them "the Content Faction") and the information-technology industries -- call the latter "the Tech Faction." That faction includes not only computer makers, software makers, and related digital-device manufacturers (think CD burners and MP3 players and Cisco routers). Allied with the Content Faction are the consumer-electronics makers -- the folks who build your VCRs and DVD players and boomboxes. The Tech Faction, which makes smarter, more programmabale devices and technologies than the consumer-electronics guys do, may count among their allies many cable companies and even telephone companies.
But what's the "collateral damage," exactly? Perhaps the most likely scenario is this: at some near-future date - perhaps as early as 2010 - individuals may no longer be able to do the kinds of things they routinely do with their digital tools in 2001. They may no longer be able, for example, to move music
or video files around easily from one of their computers to another (even if the other is just a few feet away in the same house), or to personal digital assistants. Their music collections, reduced to MP3s, may be moveable to a limited extent; unless their digital hardware doesn't allow it. The digital videos they shot in 1999 may be unplayable on their desktop and laptop computers -- or even on other devices -- in 2009.
And if they're programmers, trying to come up with the next great version of the Linux operating system, for example, they may find their development efforts put them at risk of criminal and civil penalties if the tools they develop are inadequately protective of copyright interests. Indeed, their
sons and daughters in grade-school computer classes may face similar risks, if the broadest of the changes now being proposed becomes law."

@_subject: Re: Fear and Trembling 
There are a relative few choke points for information distribution
in the West. Not all would have to be taken out at the same time,
only a few, then a pause to process intelligence garnered from
the second attack along with that of the first was on the WTC and Pentagon (the anthrax attack provided intelligence for the same planners whether done by them or planned for a later intel-gathering operation).
The short-lived patriotism after WTC/Pentagon has been
transformed into uncritical jingoism in the US and surprisingly
in the copycat UK.
There has been a stead build-up of intelligence by fire from
the various bombings of US installations leading up to WYC
and the Pentagon, as several military and intellgience analysts have noted. And still the US and its allies have not been able
to halt the attacks, despite round-up of a few low level operatives
and convictions -- but no public execution or other merciless
acts of retribution, or none that have been publicized.
The Afghan bombing has been exhibited as relatively bloodless
except for the killing of journalists and a single CIA officer --
agents of information which have become the pariahs of
many societies, not all of them non-Western.
What would have an effect in the West is not only attacks on
the infrastructure of information and its celebrated leaders
but its variety of participants -- students, teachers, preachers,
educators, journalists, publicists, ad writers, entertainers,
intellectual property creators and producers and exporters,
lawyers and a slew of professionals. These are the sources
of the offensive content and the tools, hardware, and weapons
that accompany the content, that drive opponents to murderous
rage in defense of their own cultural content.
The Western conceit that its culture is so superior that it
must impose it on others through missionary campaigns
now many centuries old, through economic policies, through eduation, through foreign policies, through military enforcement,
and through disparagement of other cultures, has bred a
deep seated anger toward the prime exporters, the idea
supremacists of state, church and family.
Despite tolerant pretensions, the West has been the bloodiest
culture that ever existed, and is getting meaner and more
vicious as its technological prowess grows and its intellectual
abilities decline -- as with all powerful bandits which get more
stupid as they conquer by force.
The US superpower vainglory is what keeps it ever blind to
the weakness of its power: it's obessession with secrecy
and belief that hardware will prevail over software, those
standard signs of power corruption preceding a fall.
All power aggrandizement thrives on cloaking its predations
with claims of superiority -- state, church and family -- and
refusal to consider that it is not as good as it dreams of
being, that is, the powerful take promotional material for Empires are susceptible to having their illusions shattered
when their cosmeticians lose their skill at concealing the
rot. Or to put it another way, when long successful cosmetic
schemes lose their power to deceive.
The US military is a shell of an effective military operation,
sustained more by publicity than by successful action. It
has had no enemy to test its promise since WW2 when it
gained a foothold in US culture through citizen military
service and luxurious payoffs to industry and education,
especially education and training for advancing Western culture through economic, political and social exports.
Targets for centers of these exports are not hard to
identify, and they are not nuclear plants, bridges,
water supplies, and digital infrastructure, probably not
even Washington DC icons of political power -- these
are propounded as in urgent need of protection to divert
attention from crucial nodes.
Again, to see which are juicy targets for undermining
Western culture, look to those hardly protected at
all except by obscurity, by never being mentioned as
needing protection, by never promoted as ideas, places and people of influence, by being those supporters of Western
culture which are so fundamental to it the culture would
not be identifiable without them.
These targets are not celebrated, they are taken for
granted as if to last forever, well, as long as King George
lasted on the American continent (his reign did not end
with the American revolution but went overground into
our most distinguished institutions of rank, privilege, elitism, secrecy, deceit and conceit).

The next major attack will not likely involve civilian aircraft; that target has been effectively crippled, wounded not killed
so that  resources must be squandered to care for it.
More likely will be a target (or targets) which provides a sense of security and does not appear to be a source of danger and fear. Where there are few protections in place, and
where the shock of attack will be maximized, not just
in casualities but in its unexpectedness.
The attack should have the effect on Western culture,
say, that bombing of Mecca would have on Islam. That is,
it should be so violently audacious that long-standing
presumptions that the enemy would never do such a
thing are overwhelmed.
Under this scenario attack by weapons of mass destruction are not likely because of the overplay of their possible use.
What then would be such an attack, least expected and
most likely to be unprotected against?
Most likely is a widely distributed attack, perhaps simultaneous
but best to be staggered or unpredictable in time and how
extensive the attack is and what all its targets are. With
unpredictable pauses in the campaign, a combination of
rapid fire hits, pauses, seeming cessation, then a hit or
two, weird and shocking concordances and discordances
with other events, violations and cruelties beyond conventional
belief, beyond reason and madness.
A clue to understanding what an attack like this would be is
to imagine what would cause battle shock in the citizenry,
not terror and flight, but incapacitation of the mind and body
to function without physically harming most of the victims.
One likely cause of this breakdown is lack of information
about what is going on and what will happen next, where danger
lies and when will violence against loved ones and self occur
next. Dread of the unknown after initial evidence that horror
is sure to come, and is inexcapable no matter what measures
have been taken to prevent it.
By now it is clear that this is what the US military did in Afghanistan, and what is most likely to be done to the US
and its allies in vengeful payback, if not soon then eventually.
Calling in F-15s to combat shoes containing explosives shows
how Western military forces helplessly misgauge its enemies. So,
too, does declaring the US has won in Afghanistan when it has not
engaged the enemy, and when it has repeatedly failed to protect its forces, its embassies and its cities from asymmetric attack.
The US and its allies is fiercest in engaging in propaganda,
ably assisted by commercial propagandists, the news media.
Beheading the centers of information warfare would be the end of Western culture.

What the FBI Doesn't Want You to See at RaisetheFist.com

According to Sherman Austin, the 19 year old owner/operator of RaisetheFist.com, the pretext for the FBI raid on his home was some of the content in the Reclaim Guide. I have mirrored this document at Carnegie Mellon. This is what Sherman is quoted as saying to an interviewer:
"They told me the main reason for the raid was because of the content on the site, and they wanted to see who was looking at it. This was not the main reason. It was an excuse. The alleged content which they claim they   were so concerned about is from the Reclaim Guide.''
I'm a registered Republican, so needless to say, I don't agree with the site owner's politics. But I'm curious why the FBI would use this Reclaim Guide as a pretext to seize a private citizen's computers.
  [Reclaim Guide Excerpts]
Defensive Weapons
In developing defensive-offense tactics, our bodies cant provide for everything we do in battle. That is why we need to be prepared with the proper tools to execute our goal. Many different weapons and tools can be used in street fighting. Make sure that you keep them clean of fingerprints, DNA fibers (hair folicles, etc.),
especially explosives because they may not always ignite. The following weapons are widely used and effective in executing the goal of the demonstration. Slings-A sling is a piece of cloth with a small pocket to hold large rocks. The cloth is spun around in the air many times until momentum is gained and one side of the cloth is let go. The rock hurls into the air at it's target. Supposedly used by David against Goliath in the "Good Book". Slingshot-C'mon, don't make me explain what this is. Bust out Bart Simpson style and fire some tiny metal pellets at pigs. Very effective when used by large groups at once. Boomerangs-These are easy to find and work pretty well. You can also make other throwing objects like ninja stars and such. With sharp items, though, you can get a stiff attempted murder charge, like the LAPD pushed on a comrade of ours at the DNC.
Basic Chemistry
Homemade explosives work very well in riots. There is a huge history of the military using homemade explosives in war, so if it works for them, it can work against them. Click on the links for construction methods. Molotov Cocktails-The most popular choice in street fighting weaponry. A very useful and effective explosive, made purely of household items. Smoke Bombs-These easily attainable or homemade items are great when dealing with illegal situations. It can shield any media or police cameras from catching anyone on film participating in an illegal act. It can also disorient the police when they are advancing on the crowd. For construction methods, click on the link. Fuel-Fertilizer Explosives-These will create an overwhelmingly large explosion and should be practiced in large faraway places like the desert before using. Make sure that you will not injure anyone that you do not intend to injure. Pipe Bombs-Not really the best explosive to use in a street fight but it still works. Causes lots of good damage. Draino Bomb-A small bomb that is very risky to use. To be used on cars only. Be careful! Soda Bottle Bomb-A somewhat biowarfare bomb made from aluminum foil and pool acid. The fumes should not be inhaled by anyone you do not want to inhale them. Match Head Bomb-A small bomb of match heads. Not too fabulous. Remember: Be careful and responsible with these explosives. Dont blow yourself up, or any of your comrades! Dont get caught! Molotov Cocktails
There are many variations of the molotov cocktail. The classic is a glass bottle filled with gasoline. An oily soaked rag is placed in the neck of the bottle.
The rag is lit on fire and the bottle is thrown at the opposition. However, practice has created new models of the molotov that defeat the classic version. When making molotovs, it is never a good idea to use the oily rag method. It can allow gas to seep from the bottle and many other bad things. The best way is to take a tampon that is soaked in gas and place it on the side of the bottle neck. Then, tie a rubber band around the tampon. Make sure the bottle has a cap on it. Light the tampon and throw hard. With this ignition method, the bottle must break! When making a molotov mixture, one of the easiest mixtures is filling half the bottle with gasoline, and the other half of the bottle with motor oil. Mix well! The oil is very flammable and sticks very well to the surface that it lands on. Another mixture is to fill half the bottle with gasoline and the other half with tar. This mixture burns very very hot and also sticks well to surfaces while the gasoline does the work. To make a firewall, simply fill bottles with rubbing alcohol and light the mixture. These bottles should be lined up side by side to create a large area of fire that police will not walk through. By far the stickiest mixture is 50% gasoline, with 25% tar and 25% grease. Shake well and throw hard! The most high explosive and lethal mixture is amonium-
nitrate-based fertilizer mixed with gasoline. Just stuff the bottle with this mixture and light the fucker. This method should be made with a plastic bottle so that it will not break on impact. When you light it, the bottle will quickly explode so be quick. Using a fuse is a good idea. Fuel Fertilizer Explosive
As you've probably already read in the chapter dealing with firebombs, it is possible to make a powerful high explosive based on any ammonium nitrate
fertilizer. According to some sources, all that is necessary to make such explosives is wrapping a fistful of fertilizer in a large fuel-soaked cloth. Igniting the cloth would then result in a powerful explosion. Others claim, though, that to get a real high-order explosive, one should mix the fertilizer with a small amount of fuel. Since different brands of fertilizer
contain different amounts of ammonium nitrate, experimenting should be necessary. It has also been said that such explosive can only be set off by a
shockwave from a military style detonator. Pipe Bombs
You want a standard steel pipe (two inches in diameter is a good size) that is threaded on both ends so you can cap it. The length you use depends on how big an explosion is desired. Sizes between 3-10 inches in length have been successfully employed. Make sure both caps screw on tightly before you insert the powder. The basic idea to remember is that a bomb is simply a hot fire burning very rapidly in a tightly confined space. The rapidly expanding gases burst against the walls of the bomb. If they are trapped in a tightly sealed iron pipe, when they finally break out, they do so with incredible force. If the
bomb itself is placed in a somewhat enclosed area like a ventilation shaft, doorway or alleyway, it will in turn convert this larger area into a "bomb" and increase the over-all explosion immensely. When you have the right pipe and both caps selected, drill a hole in the side of the pipe (before powder is inserted) big enough to pull the fuse through. If
you are using a firecracker fuse, insert the firecracker, pull the fuse through and epoxy it into place securely. If you are using long fusing either with a detonator (difficult to come by) timing device or a simple cancerette fuse, drill two holes and run two lines of fuse into the pipe. When you have the fuse rigged to the pipe, you are ready to add the powder. Cape one end snugly, making sure you haven't trapped any grains of powder in the threads. Wipe the device with rubbing alcohol and you're ready to blast off. A good innovation is to grind down one half of the pipe before you insert the powder. This makes the walls of one end thinner than the walls of the other
end. When you place the bomb, the explosion, following the line of least resistance, will head in that direction. You can do this with ordinary grinding
tools available in any hardware or machine shop. Be sure not to have the powder around when you are grinding the pipe, since sparks are produced. Draino Bomb
Take any plastic film canister and fill 3/4 of the cannister with Comet. Fill the rest with Draino and put the lid on it. Take this mixture to a cop car and
drop it in the gas tank. Run like hell. In about ten minutes the car will explode like in the movies. However, if you are at a demonstration, there are always people around. It is not safe to assume that your comrades or innocent bystanders wont be near the car. You dont want to hurt anyone that you dont intend to hurt. Be Fucking Careful! Soda Bottle Bomb
Take a 2 liter plastic soda bottle and fill about a quarter of it with Muramic Acid (pool acid). After this you have to work fast! Drop some aluminum foil
strips into the bottle and put the cap on. Shake it up a bit and throw it. It will create a gas and explode. The fumes are very hazardous, so make sure you wont harm anyone unless you intend to.
Smoke Bombs
Mix 4 parts sugar with 6 parts salt peter. Heat this over a low flame until it melts, stirring well. Pour into a container. When pouring place a few wooden
matches into it for a fuse. About a pound of this will smoke up an entire block. Match Head Bomb
Take a plastic pipe and cap one end. Fill the pipe with match heads and pack it tightly. Put the cap on the other end and put a small hole in the cap so you
can run a fuse through it. Light the fuse and it will explode.

So they must erect fantastic images of themselves, constantly
culling their output for new ways of packaging it; they must destroy
whatever innovation puts their reputation at risk; they must band

After Levy explained the role of non-gov cryptographers in freeing
cypto from government control, with a mention of cypherpunks, the host, Goodale, pressed Kahn and Levy to agree that "punks" and "nerds" should be held accountable for the likely damage to national
security that followed. Goodale said punks and nerds with disparagement, as if speaking of anti-socials. He appeared to
be expressing a view not his alone but one discussed in the clubs
of centralized power.
Neither Levy nor Kahn agreed with that view. Levy in particular
defended the liberation of crypto with conviction such that Goodale
backed off, saying he only meant to state the accusation strongly to
get a good response. Again, Goodale seemed to be following an agenda for assigning blame for 911 to crypto availability.
Neither Levy nor Kahn cited that investigators have found no use
of crypto by the 911 attackers.
Levy made the points that nobody knows for sure whether crypto
is in use by terroritsts but that it most likely is; that bin Laden
would never use an escrow-compromised program; that nobody
knows what NSA can crack; that the weakness of crypto is
in the implementation not the mathematics; that traffic analysis
was used to trace terrorist activities in the embassy bombing
investigation. Kahn concurred with these points.
It is worth bearing in mind that there continues to be an attempt to
demonize crypto by way of 911, that punks and nerds are likely
targets, that there may be re-institution of crypto control measures,
despite Levy and Kahn disagreeing with that view.
This crypto demonization may well intensify as investigations proceed into the government, military and intelligence failure to prevent 911. Whether crypto actually played any role in the attack may be seen as unimportant so long as a convincing
story can be promoted that it must have been.
On the British predecessors: it remains to be seen how much
of their work was leaked to Diffie. We've got an FOIA request
into NSA on this topic, now two years old, and have been
told by NSA that it has material from the date of the British invention. No work on when or what will be released.
Tim is right that Diffie, Hellman, all the PK early developers,
deserve all the credit for making PK public and the British
deserve none for their compulsive secrecy. And it may be
only academic as to who invented PK. Still, it is worth learning
what the possibilities are for attacks on PK, especially in the
light of its unparalleled reputation for public use, or, as
David Kahn said, its value as "the single most important
invention in the history of cryptography."
That sort of language makes me nervous about what lurks
in the heart of PK, its invention, its leak, its liberation, its
widespread public use, its seeming impregnability. A fair
amount of the reputation of PK is comparable to a sophisticated
sting -- the kind Kahn richly documents throughout the history
of cryptography.
If liberation of cryptography is a sting, what role of cpunks
in that? What role vainglory in falling for the allure of anti-
authority as the sting unfolds. Levy has words about this,
although I have no reason to believe his early vaunting of
cypherpunks was part of a wider scheme, nor his recent
book. But, still, wizened cryptographers, as Kahn documents,
claim you cannot ever be too paranoid.
Whatever NSA releases on pre-Diffie PK, it will not be
the truth but probably convincing to the believers in fairy
tale crypto protection. The Brits way of leaking PK history to accomplish a hidden task or ability is similarly suspicious.

The topic was what role encryption may have played
in 911.
Steve was persuasive in noting that crypto should not
be singled out as a lethal technology for terrorism any
more than other technology that could be put to malign
Cypherpunks got a plug from Steve for making encryption
"hip." Though Goodale attempted to get Steve to agree
that it was not a good thing for crypto to be liberated from
government control, Steve wouldn't buy that, and he credited
cypherpunks with a principal role in popularizing and spreading the technology, along with Phil Zimmermann's PGP effort. David Kahn agreed with Steve that there was nothing that could be done about loss of government control of encryption, the technology was out there for all to use for good or bad purposes.
David reaffirmed his belief that key escrow would have
been best for the country's security, but now it was no longer possible. (We heard David state that a few years
back at a crypto conference in NYC.)
David was emphatic that public key cryptography is the
single most important invention in the entire history of

A major US ISP which is a subsidiary of a foreign corporation hosts a US government operation to monitor *all* traffic handled by the ISP at a central network operations center.

No officer or employee of the foreign corporation or the ISP subsidiary has access to or control over the operation. Traffic
is monitored by personnel who have security clearances for handling confidential information acquired by monitoring. Streaming data may be searched for key words or other information, collected and transmitted to the sponsoring agency
for analysis and evaluation.
The representative claims that another US government surveillance activity set up after September 11 is for ISPs to host sites set up to offer information likely to be sought by terrorists, such as detailed airline schedules or other dangerous information. The logs of access to these sites are copied to CDs daily and sent to the supervising agency. ISP personnel are forbidden to monitor the sites or examine the logs. Numerous US ISPs are allegedly involved in this activity. As far as known this activity is not the result of a court order.

misinformed, allegedly in the national interest.
7. The US lacks a mechanism such as the British Parliament to question its
ruling Taliban; the media claims this role for itself but does not do what it
is specially privileged to do, particularly in times of war and variations on
alleged national emergencies, primarily because much of the media is
organized to distribute simple-minded entertainment matters based on
a flood of custom-made delivery mechanisms -- press releases, conferences,
salons, din-dins, retreats, pillow talk, temporary service in minor roles in government and study groups.
8. As we see here virtually all the time, debate never exceeds what the
debaters have read, seen and heard of media output, except in the
rare cases of original research, and even then, until the research is
valorized by media coverage nobody pays attention to it.

The Wall Street Journal today reports today on alleged
Al Qaeda computer files bought from a seller in Kabul which were encoded and encrypted.
A key encrypted document reports on a tour assessing
terrorist targets in Egypt and Israel, very similar to the alleged travels of Richard C. Reid.
The type of encryption is not identified, nor who provided
help cracking the encryption with "an array of high-speed
computers programmed to crack passwords."

This is from the UK Independent today:
How they cracked the terrorists' code=20
Getting to the heart of the documents contained in
the al-Qa'ida computer =AD bought by chance by the
Wall Street Journal's reporter in Kabul =AD meant
cracking the encryption of Microsoft's Windows
2000 operating system installed on the machine,
which had been used to protect the data.=20
That is not a trivial task. Microsoft will only say
that if you lose the password that controls entry to
a Windows 2000 system, your best option is to
remember it =AD or simply to wipe the machine and
start again. And its Encrypting File System (EFS),
which had been used to encode the files, is just as
But the files were too valuable for that. Instead,
the team embarked on the task of breaking
through the encryption, which jumbles the
contents of the files so that even someone reading
the individual bytes of data stored on the actual
hard disk (rather than trying to access them
through the operating system, which had locked
them out) would simply find rubbish.=20
Cracking the encryption meant finding the digital
"key" that had previously been used to unlock it.
That was not stored in any readable file on the
machine, for it was itself encrypted.=20
The only way to reproduce it was to generate the
key from first principles: by trying various
combinations of random bits and trying to
decrypt the file with them, and seeing if it
produced sense =AD or gibberish.=20
Luckily, the PC had a version of Windows 2000
with an "export-quality" key =AD only 40-bits long,
rather than the "US" quality, which being 128-bits
long would have been billions of times harder to
Even so, it took the equivalent of a set of
supercomputers running for five days, 24 hours a
day, to find the key. But find it they did.=20
The irony that the terrorists used a product made
by one of the US's biggest corporations to
protect plans it was making against it may not be
lost on an administration that recently relaxed rules
on the export of "strong" encryption. Tighter
controls may follow.=20

In addition to the 13 main US intelligence agencies, every government department, independent agency and special commission has an intelligence function. These units
may be formally listed but are more oftenincluded in the legal counsel and security elements of the organization.
Regular liaison with the main intelligence agencies is provided. There are exchanges of personnel with the intel
agencies, for specific operations and for training. Intel
officers serve in these organizations domestically and
overseas, sometimes with the knowledge of other
members of the units but often only with the knowledge
of the unit's legal and/or security officers.
Similarly, specialists from these units are assigned to
intel agencies for duty when there is a need for their
expertise, and intel officers are assigned to the units
when there is a need for special intelligence or for
counterintelligence -- and when there is a need for
deniability for either or both the unit and the IC.
NASA has one of the largest intelligence operations,
and there are substantial intel units in Agriculture, Commerce (including BXA, NIST and more), Labor, Justice (in addition to FBI), FAA, FCC, NTSB and so on. Advisory panels and technical advicory
committees customarily have as members or staff
intel officers or reporting agents.
Substantial intelligence operations also occur at the

Au contraire, the spread of intelligence disease since 1947 requires

Yes, this is an affirmation that encrypted data is a sign of

I do not know what legal authority there is for holding onto
encrypted data that cannot be shown by law enforcement to be any of the five things listed in the FBI affidavit. Mere
encryption is not a crime, is it?
This development is similar to anti-circumvention provisions
of the DMCA in that innocent circumvention is by definition
not acceptable to copyrighted content authorities.
This demonization of encryption and circumvention until they
have been exorcised by official and commercial authorities is similar to the provision which allows the NSA to collect and retain encrypted communications forever, even that of US Persons, no matter what purpose unerlies encryption use,
though collection of non-encrypted communications of US Persons is proscribed.
This open-endedness of stigmatizing crypto is diabolically
wondrous, for it places the burden of innocence on anyone who attempts to exclude oversight of authorities of personal

I agree that abuses occur, having done that myself overmuch,
but abuses are hardly limited to the current practitioners,
those long reputable and not so much.
And nasty, prolonged personal attacks are a pain to
the target, a pleasure to the attacker, and ho-hum to
bystanders -- except those who enjoy watching others
squirm and act like assholes in lieu of participating
as pitcher and catcher.
According to the evidence regularly displayed here
being an asshole is benefical therapy, as exhibited
by the artful and the clumsy, high-minded and vulgar.
Indeed, never being an asshole has consequences of
built-up spleen, maybe becoming murderous if the pressure
exceeds personal discipline or moral constraint. That's
why doting parents kill their kids, and idolized leaders push their followers into war. Too much acceptable
behavior drives the practitioner to forbidden vices.
Being attacked by an asshole has more subtle benefits,
one of them is that you get an education in adverse effects
of the vice self-defended as a virture; another of them is that you pick up pointers on how to misbehave, to define autoerotic perversity as tough love, and to term it socially acceptable disnomers: constructive critique, forebearance, tolerance, civilized, in the national interest. Though bemused observers can see the asshole is incapable of foregoing ecstatic licking its aperture and its issue.
This is not an example, show respect.
What is to be done with the abusers? Trick them into setting
up their very own website, mail list, forum, church, whorehouse,
pederasty, political party, secret society by unctuous advice
and praise of their genius, which would be best advanced in
distinguished splendor. Better, report their crimes to the
authorities, swear the lying truth, tut-tut the loss of their input,
cackle at their imprisonment, prepare for the next fools
too smart by half. Then as day of their release approaches check your locks at night, set the alarms, stroke your defenses, cold sweat who's coming to avenge your disdain for their gullibility.
Sly abusers know the gross abusers are out there sniffing for
tell-tale perfume of the goody-badhearts, and nothing can be done

Bentham's Panopticon has beguiled watchers since its invention.
What the notion does is hypnotize the watchers into believing they
really do see everything, and this notion still inspires vast funding
for surveillance programs around the globe.
But those who are supposedly being watched can fairly quickly
learn that the watchers are drunkened by their surveillance
conceits, as prisoners did in Bentham's day, and devise means
and methods to hide in the inevitable gaps in oversight systems.
What surveillance systems do, and the more powerful the more
corrupting, is to lull the operators and the customers into diminished
awareness of human ingenuity and capability, literally becoming
numbed to daily challenges to keep senses alert and responsive
to new perceptions not known or understood at the time the
oversight systems were devised.
Another consequence of panopticonism is the heightened susceptibility of abuse, bribery, blackmail and coercion of the operators and the customers. As well as the production of
phony revelations and disinformation about the systems
capabilities and applicabilities.
Practitioners of panopticonism and counter-panopticonism
are at each others' throats with wild claims and counterclaims,
and the most common accusation is criminality, which may
be laughable in a field where criminality is by definition moot.
Panopticonists always presume to be above the law, asserting
that they serve to undergird law and its enforcement, and thus
must be free of law's constraints to assure that the outer limits
of law are protected.
Counter-panopticists hoot at this, for they know from field
experience how much the surveillists miss, then lie about.
Spying, intelligence, and their counters and customers are inheritors of Bentham's alluring scam.
Recall that Bentham's panopticon only works for believers
in an omniscient deity. And those who believe in arms laughed at Bentham's success with the credulous in getting them
to give up the fight without bearing arms.
As we know about contemporary surveillance systems: a large

method of losing prisoners to unnerve the victim and give the prosecution more time to ready for trial:
  The attorney also argued:
1. Austin was labelled a "terrorist" by his NY jailers, a mean-ass
bunch who relish hammering the foreign bombers under their TLC.
2. Sending Austin to OK with that label attached could put
him at risk from jailers and inmates located in a region
relishing memories of vengance for OKC.
3. Austin was freezing his ass off due to lack of heat,
clothing and bedding in his cell.
The attorney made a fair argument that the FBI's and USA's
affidavits and charges were crocks, but the judge wouldn't bite,
though he did order extra clothing for shivering Sherman.
She derided the FBI's warning to NYPD about Sherman being
a threat, and demolished the argument he was packing WMD
tools in the jalopy he drove from CA to NY.
Sherman was due for shipment to California yesterday, but

New York is a world of fanciful invention of people

A fellow this evening claimed to have been present
at the session when the US and the Soviets agreed to
detarget one another, at Bolling AFB, thus closing
down the Doomsday Scenario two generations lived
with, through various administrations of the US and
the Soviets.
What was interesting about this story was the behavior
of the US and Soviet military officers who had control
of the weaponry which could determine who lived and who died for some 50 years, and not the transient
officials who headed governments.
According to the person telling the story, the USAF
officer heading the US's MAD program told him the day of
detargeting was the happiest of his life.
The Soviet colonel general who came to the US to arrange
detargeting was found, again according to this eyewitness,
watching the I Love Lucy Show and laughing his ass off. Boots off, wearing mismatched socks, mouth filled
with golden teeth.
The Soviet colonel general was also said to be relieved
that the standoff was over at long last. And that it was now
time to construct retirement facilities for no longer needed MAD officers.
Is there any way this event's particular circumstances can be verified? That detargeting occurred is known, but what of
the main officers' thoughts about no longer being ready to
unleash the dreaded armaments year after year, and their
relief at the passing of the nearly unbearable responsibility?
This is well beyond what the physicists and engineers of
the weaponry have disclosed of their feelings. The handover
of the weapons to officers in the field, though supposedly
restrained by a battery of controls, does raise a question
of what it was like to be in command of the weapons, to
remain ready to launch them even if nations' leaders could
not order an attack.
Do physicists and behavioral scientists address the effect
of commanding horrific weaponry -- not that of the launch
officers in control of the keys, but that of the officers who
must decide to issue the orders of launch when there is
no higher authority to say do it now?
The person who told this story said the US officers in
command are southerners, mean sons of bitches who would
have no reservation in launching mass killing weaponry. This didn't ring true: why southerners and not any other American? And what of the claim that the officer in command
claiming detargeting was the happiest day of his life? Why

HIJACK and TEAPOT thievery by way of violating encrypted cellphones toward the bottom of this page:
  If you lose the key for a new Lexus RX 300, one northern
Virginia dealer charges $300 for a replacement. Even for
a plain-jane Taurus, the price is $130 at a Ford dealer
here. Neither price is unusual. Dealers have the market
mostly to themselves; very few locksmiths or hardware
stores can copy the keys to late-model cars.
The technology is beyond their capabilities. For most new
cars, from the top of the price scale to the bottom, the key
is no longer a sliver of notched metal that simply works a
mechanical lock; it is now part of an electronic access
system, with computer- encoded passwords worthy of
James Bond.
Colloquially, the new keys are said to have a computer
chip inside. Actually, the head of the key contains a tiny
robot radio that communicates with the car. Their
electronic handshake may include 19 digits, which allows
10 billion-billion combinations.
While this makes life more complicated for car owners, it
poses a bigger hurdle for car thieves, who so far have not
caught up. The new keys have helped to slash the theft rate
on some models by 90 percent.
The technology differs among manufacturers, but all are
similar. At the heart of the system is a tiny electronic
device embedded in the head of the key. This device,
called a transponder, is essentially a radio that responds
to a query from another radio.
In older systems, the car sends a question and the key
gives a fixed answer. In newer models, Mr. Sabetti said,
the car has a random number generator, sending a different
message each time the key is inserted.
"When the random number is sent to the key head, the key
modifies it in a way that would only be known to the
vehicle," he said. The answer from the key "has virtually
no relationship to the message sent to the key in the first
place," he said, or at least none that an electronic
eavesdropper could discern. To anyone who intercepted
the electronic message, "it would look like garbage," he
Moving to the transponder system has had several effects.
One is to cut out locksmiths. "It can run up to $50,000 for
the equipment to duplicate the keys for cars," said Randy
L. Simpson, president of the Associated Locksmiths of
America, a trade association based in Dallas. And that is
for each manufacturer; equipping a shop to make keys for
all car brands would be well beyond the means of most
For example, on a 2001 Ford Taurus, the car can "teach" a
key the proper code. But it is built to do so only if the
technician starts the car with one of the keys that came
with the vehicle, turns it off, starts the car with the second
key that came with the vehicle, turns it off, and then inserts
the new key  with the metal shaft mechanically cut and
the transponder unprogrammed and awaiting instructions.
General Motors' keys have a mere 137 billion possible
combinations, and a dealer can make a copy with only one
of the factory- original keys to work with. But they have
another refinement; the systems recognize the difference
between a full-access key and a "valet" key that will start
the car but cannot be used to "teach" a new key the car's
combination, said David T. Proefke, engineering group
manager for vehicle security.
But however good the system is, Mr. Simpson of the
locksmiths association said this was not the last step in
car security. "They haven't defeated it yet," he said. "But
I'm sure it's just a matter of time."

The NY Times followup of the WSJ's Richard Reid report noted that
the computer on which Reid's travel account was found contained
some 1500 files, and that other stories were likely to come from
those files. Recall that some computer files had been decrypted and some not yet.
Though not reported, I assume that the WSJ was being given
decryptions selectively if the decrypt was being done by the
USG or USG contractors. And like most of relying on cryptographers,
reporters and translators having to trust the information. (The WSJ never disclosed who was doing the decrypts.) What else was being found in the decrypts other than what the Journal was given and what was reported of that in its one story is unknown.
However, there's a good chance that Pearl was following up
on some of that privileged information in his Reid investigation,
and some of that may have dealt with Pakistan's intelligence
services. Or the PK intel boyos suspected that.
And whoever once owned the computer, or those who worried
about what was in its files, could badly have wanted to know
what was being learned from decrypts. Or if nothing else would
like to know if the WSJ story was a rabbit set out to snare
A few days after the WSJ Reid story was published about the
encrypted files I wrote one of the reporters to inquire about the type of encryption used and who was doing the decrypts. He answered quickly that he was in transit but would be pleased to answer questions once stationary. Nothing has been heard from him since then, and Pearl's kidnapping a few days later could have killed any prospect of getting answers, what with WSJ HQ (and who knows who else) putting a lock on Finally, the two reporters of the January 16 Reid story, Alan
Cullison and Andrew Higgins, seem to have disappeared, by whom who knows. And whither the balance of those 1500 files? And were they real or phony?

  Back at The Wall Street Journal, Byron Calame, a deputy   managing editor, told E&P that many in the newsroom do not
  know exactly what is happening with the Pearl case because   such information is being kept under tight control.
From New York Observer, February [?], 2002:
  This internal ignorance is partially due to the WSJs own   strategy of keeping any company decisions related to Mr.
  Pearl very close to the vest. To date, there have been no   meetings with reporters in the New York offices to talk   about Mr. Pearl, no group discussions to air things out.

This is not what I've heard and read from a number of journalists, and the Journal's own reporters of the Reid story had qualms. As reported in the NY Times:
  Asked if there had been dissent from Mr. Cullison or Mr. Higgins,   the [WSJ spokesman] said: "There was discussion with the reporters   about this. No reporter would want to be in a position of freely handing   things over to the government. This was a national security issue, a   major issue, an are-lives-at-stake issue."
The last sentence is WSJ editorial-speak for self-importance, and
likely not shared by the two journalists who had to understand
the personal and professional consequences for them. To be sure
their protest may have been pro forma professional quisling, but
their risk in Central Asia was real.
So, no Declan, you are wrong in invoking the unwarranted
personal exculpation of "what everyone else would do." Though that invocation of crowd reveals a clue what you would do, have done, will do. On Pearl's Jewishness, that does seem to have been a reason
to kill him, and for the killers it is a political rationale. Whether that was the reason to kidnap him has not been demonstrated.
What is of interest is the way the personal tragedy is being used
to camouflage and direct public attention away from the political aspects of what was a political kidnapping and murder. As the
Journal would say, "this was a national security issue, a major issue, an are-lives-at-stake issue."
This personalization technique is traditionally used in such situations to make the perps appear demon for killing our boys
our women and children, as with the entire 911 affair and
subsequent greater savagery in Afghanistan. The sappy coverage of the Pearl killing by the Journal is hardly the quality the paper is known for, and appears to be a ploy to deflect attention from political ramifications of a scheme gone
awry, standard psyop when taking sides is the name of the game, not objective reporting. Standard exculpation of complicity. Standard demogoguery of the patriots when

The report said a document describing Reid's trip was shared with the US government officials, and that encrypted parts of the document were decrypted with assistance of unnamed parties.   Shortly afterwards the Journal was publicly thanked by the Defense Department for sharing the information. The Journal
claimed it was doing its patriotic duty.
On January 21, 2002, the New York Times published "Why Reporters' Discovery Was Shared With Officials," which examined possible consequences of journalists sharing information with officials, one of which was the prospect of endangering reporters suspected of being government agents.   When the CIA is asked the about use of journalists as agents, the agency answers that it continues a policy which reserves that right. On January 23, 2002, Daniel Pearl went to a meeting arranged to investigate Richard Reid and was kidnapped. The kidnappers claimed Pearl was an intelligence agent; the Journal has denied it.

How the Journal got Al Qaeda's computers  By Dan Kennedy
This past Monday's Wall Street Journal led with an astounding story about a personal computer that had apparently been used by Al Qaeda terrorists to plot the September assassination of Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud. The computer's hard drive also reportedly contained bioterrorism information and a 23-minute video clip of Osama bin Laden denouncing the United States and enthusing over the September 11 attacks.
How the computer came to be acquired by the Journal
is a pretty amazing story in itself.
The article by staff reporters Alan Cullison and
Andrew Higgins offers a few details. A "Journal
reporter" purchased the IBM desktop computer, as well
as a Compaq laptop, in Kabul for a total of $1100 after
being told that they had been looted from an Al Qaeda
office following a US bombing raid. The article goes
on to say that US officials confirmed the authenticity
of the files, "and say they provide a trove of
information about the inner workings of the secretive
Intrigued, I sent e-mails to both reporters. Cullison, the
paper's Moscow correspondent, temporarily ensconced
in Washington, wrote back within a few hours.
"I was in need of a computer, because the one that the
Wall Street Journal issued me was smashed when the
car I was taking over the Hindu Kush Mountains lost
its brakes and rolled," Cullison said. "I was looking for
one, and was much more interested in this laptop and
the hard drive [from the IBM] when I heard it was used
by al Qaeda."
The Journal's foreign editor, John Bussey, says that
Cullison had been covering the Northern Alliance for
about a month and a half when his computer was
destroyed. Several weeks ago, after the liberation of
Kabul, Bussey says Cullison went computer shopping
and was told that the IBM and the Compaq had been
used in the headquarters of bin Laden's chief strategist,
Mohammed Atef, who died in a bombing raid in
November. Cullison purchased the equipment and was
reportedly able to determine rather quickly that there
was at least some evidence on the IBM's hard drive
that Al Qaeda files were indeed present.
At that point, Bussey says, Journal editors realized they
had to notify the US government. "Who knows?
Maybe there's a calendar of upcoming events," Bussey
explains. The Journal negotiated with the Department
of Defense to turn over the computers in Kabul the
next day. Before the handover, Bussey says, Cullison
and Higgins managed to copy the contents of the IBM
hard drive onto Journal equipment, although they were
unable to get past the Compaq's password-protection
Working with the copied contents of the hard drive,
Cullison, Higgins, translators, and a computer expert
hired by the Journal spent eight days combing through
the files and preparing Monday's story. Defense
Department officials, meanwhile, verified the
authenticity of those files. The Compaq, though,
yielded nothing: government computer experts were
able to crack the password, but reported that all the
files had been erased.
"Sometimes chance and happenstance play an
incredible part in an incredible story," Bussey says.
So will there be more from the Al Qaeda computer
files? "I'll tell you later on," Bussey says, then adds
that he wants the Journal's computer expert to take
another look at the Compaq: "Is the laptop stuff really
erased? We'll have to see."

Dell's admission of vetting customer use of its
products on behalf of domestic and national security,
raises the issue of who else is doing that.
About ten days ago I got a telephone message from
a person who claims to work for a major ISP as a sysadmin. This person had previously disclosed the ISP's cooperation
with federal authorities to run a nationwide surveillance
system from a central hub of the ISP, claiming that the
system was set up under a memorandum of understanding
when the ISP was bought by a foreign corporation. We've
published this allegation on Cryptome.
We returned the call and talked about twenty minutes with
the person, who said that surveillance of the Net is increasing rapidly over what he had said earlier. Then
came a pitch that I get on board by vetting information
sent to Cryptome with federal authorities if I thought
there might be a threat to national security.
The pitch got intense.The person asked if I had criminal background. I said no. Did I believe the US had enemies.
I said yes. Did I believe it was my responsibility to protect
the nation. I said maybe. Was it not wise to report threats
to the nation to authorities? I said no, it was wise to report
them to the public so it could protect itself.
But, he said, don't you think the threats should be checked
with the authorities first? No, I said, it is not for me to
decide what is a threat and what is not, that my task is to
make information available and let readers decide.
Wouldn't you like to boost your authority, he said, by having
it supported by official authority? I said no, that I did not
want authority, that such authority is widely available for
those who want it from responsible sources. Instead, I
said, what is needed is more information not filtered by authorities or responsible sources.
Don't get me wrong, he said, I admire what you're doing
on Cryptome, and I wish I had your courage. Thanks, I
Still, he said, I think it would be a good idea for you to
establish an ongoing relationship with the authorities
so you don't get in trouble. No, I said, that is definitely
not something I want to do, for if I did that it would
be a betrayal of Cryptome readers.
You know, he said, I'm very troubled by what my company
is doing, but I think in times of danger we all have to do
what we can to protect the nation, and I think you should
get in touch with the authorities to be sure information
you get is okay to publish. No, I said, that's not for me,
what is needed in times of danger is more information
about how to protect yourself, and in times of danger
authorities are often a threat as great as what they
warn about.
How can you be sure of that, he said, I think you need
to talk to the authorities to be sure you know what the
threats are and what you are doing is okay. No, thanks,
I said.
Someday, he said, I hope I have your courage, but now
I have to think about my job. Agreed, I said, you should
do nothing that will put you in danger, don't jeopardize
you job and your family.
However, he said, I want you to think very carefully about
arranging to check with the authorities about information
to be published on Cryptome. Look, I said, the authorities
have more than adequate means to keep track of information going on Crypotme and they don't need my help.
But you need to protect yourself, don't you see, to be sure
that you are not entrapped by information sent to you
for that purpose. Agreed, I said, but we were told soon after
setting up Cryptome to expect entrapment efforts, so we
do, and the reason we don't claim authority is to be sure
readers know they have to protect themselves in the
same way we do. But wouldn't you like to be protected by the authorities,
to advocate to your readers that they do the same? No,
I said, that is the role of authorities and responsible
publishers, not Cryptome.
I think this conversation is like many going on around
the country, and shows how recruitment of agents is
being done. We'd like to publish such accounts, anonymized

These reports are sent to the dangler or Codex will offer that service.
In addition to thinking Codex leaked the docs to boost its

documents. Still, beware. And let us know if bugs are spotted.
We were not able to open the XLS docs and a few
others, which appear to have protection; however
with a hex editor we could see that the docs show who either bought Codex products or to whom proposals were made. They range from the New Jersey District Court Pre-Trial Services (perhaps related to the Scarfo case -- DIRT is
a possible candidate for the Scarfo keylogger), to the US government (mostly mil), to an Egyptian government technical research laboratory, to a variety of corporations and eduational institutions (all named). Some of these were DIRT customers, some for BAIT, an anti-theft computer tracking program. Once we get full access
we'll publish the names of DIRT customers.
The docs also describe Codex contracts with resellers
and partners in the US, Australia, Agentina and elsewhere, with profit-sharing arrangements and NDAs. We'll

they appear to be fund-raising fluff more than actual plans.

To activate it without requirement for a dongle took about 20 minutes of basic examination and only 6 bytes of change were required.
The software seems to work by shoehorning in the file CORE.DAT to whatever executable is tagged for 'bugging'. Disassembly of that file and the associated coredll.dat reveals the keylogging routines.
[Transmittal of an enabled DIRT implementation.]
I've included the listings for the relevant files along with the
executables (they are labelled .lst in the main directory). The file "dummy1.lst" was created by
disassembling the included dummy.exe file after 'bugging' it. dummy.lst is the file
before bugging. In case you are wondering the name "Gary Colton" at the top of the listings
comes from the copy of IDA pro I used to have a look :-). Perhaps he should be credited
with their discovery :-)

PGP, or Pretty Good Privacy, is available free online for personal use, a major reason the company saw little future in trying to make a business of selling the software for corporate use, said spokeswoman Jennifer Keavney.
"It is the leading encryption technology out there, but it's all based on
free downloads,'' she said.
Sorry to hear about the layoffs, but the news about PGP freeware
is inspiring. Sure hope Phil and others got a decent chomp of NAI And that NAI didn't stick a nasty biteback in the freeware when the

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March 25, 2002
The Department of Justice and The United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today asked a federal court in San Francisco to approve its service of a John Doe summons on VISA International. "John Doe" summonses permit the IRS to obtain information about people whose identities are unknown. The information expected in response to the summons will help the IRS identify people who use offshore accounts to evade their United States income tax liabilities. There are VISA-
sponsored credit, charge or debit cards issued by banks in more than 30 countries, including Switzerland, Latvia,
Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Bermuda and numerous Caribbean nations.
Also today, in a federal court in Miami, The Department of Justice filed papers reflecting American Express's agreement to turn over records relating to people who may be subject to United States income taxes and who have credit card accounts with addresses in Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas or the Cayman Islands.
MasterCard has already produced over 1.7 million records, involving over 230,000 accounts, in response to a John Doe summons, According to the IRS, that information will be used in civil audits and criminal If the MasterCard information is representative of the industry, there could be 1 to 2 million U.S. citizens with debit/credit cards issued by offshore banks. This compares with only 170,000 Reports of Foreign Bank & Financial Accounts (FBARS) being filed in 2000 and only 117,000 individual 1040 filers indicating they had offshore bank accounts (tax year 1999).

Getronics Government Solutions has delivered the v1.3 R10 Enhanced
SNACC (eSNACC) Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) Compiler,
C++ library and C library source code and binaries tested on the Linux, Sun Solaris 2.8 and Microsoft Windows NT/98/2000/XP operating
systems.  The eSNACC software is freely available to everyone from:
.  The v1.3 R10
eSNACC release fixes significant bugs present in the previous
The eSNACC ASN.1 software can be used to ASN.1 encode and decode
objects.  In past releases, Getronics improved the eSNACC C++ library to implement the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER), support large ASN.1 INTEGERs, and improve memory usage.    v1.3 R10 eSNACC enhancements (compared to v1.3 R8 and R9 releases):
1) We corrected the eSNACC ASN.1 C and C++ libraries to properly
implement the sorting of SET OF components as specified in the 1997
X.690 DER requirements.  The eSNACC ASN.1 C++ library was incorrectly ignoring the tag and length of each component when determining their order.  The bug was present in the v1.3 R7, v1.3 R8, and v1.3 R9 releases of the eSNACC ASN.1 C++ library.  This bug caused
interoperability problems with correct DER implementations.  For example, this bug caused the S/MIME Freeware Library (SFL) (that
uses the eSNACC ASN.1 C++ library) to report signature verification problems when attempting to verify valid signed S/MIME messages.   2) We corrected several bugs in the eSNACC ASN.1 C++ and C  libraries that we discovered when testing them using the Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP) v1 test suite developed by the
University of Oulu.  The bugs were all error handling problems that
occurred when each ASN.1 library attempted to decode invalidly encoded indefinite lengths on primitive types.  These were all bugs
in the original SNACC code.  We used the v1.3 R10 eSNACC ASN.1 C++ and C libraries to successfully process all 18,000 test cases in the SNMPv1 Oulu test suite.  3) We fixed a bug in CSM_Buffer::Write(...) (sm_buffer.cpp file)
that resulted in a significant decrease in the time required to
ASN.1 decode objects greater than 1MB in size.
We tested the v1.3 R10 eSNACC release with the v2.0.1 S/MIME
Freeware Library (SFL) (with patch files applied) available from  that uses the eSNACC ASN.1 software to encode and decode the IETF S/MIME v3 Cryptographic Message Syntax (RFC 2630) and Enhanced
Security Services for S/MIME (RFC 2634) security protocol.  We tested the v1.3 R10 eSNACC release with the freeware v2.0.1
Certificate Management Library (CML) (no patch files required) available from   that uses the eSNACC ASN.1 software to encode and decode X.509 certificates, attribute certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists as specified in the 2000 X.509 Recommendation.
We tested the v1.3 R10 eSNACC release with the freeware v2.0.1
Access Control Library (ACL) (no patch files required to use
v1.3 R10 eSNACC release) available from
.  The ACL uses
the eSNACC ASN.1 software to encode and decode security
labels and other objects (such as Security Policy Information Files) required to provide rule based access control as specified in SDN.801.
The eSNACC ASN.1 software implements the majority of the ASN.1 encoding/decoding rules as specified in the 1988 X.209 Recommendation.  It implements the DER as specified in the 1997 X.690 Recommendation.  It does not support all of the latest ASN.1
features, but there are strategies that allow it to be used to produce ASN.1 hex encodings that are identical to those produced by
ASN.1 libraries that do support the latest ASN.1 features.  Also note
that many of the PKIX specs, such as RFC 2459 and RFC 2630, include 1988-compliant ASN.1 syntax modules which can be compiled using the
eSNACC compiler.
The eSNACC ASN.1 library is totally unencumbered as stated in the Enhanced SNACC Software Public License.  All source code
for the eSNACC software is being provided at no cost and with no
financial limitations regarding its use and distribution.  Organizations can use the eSNACC software without paying
any royalties or licensing fees.  The Internet Mail Consortium (IMC) has established an eSNACC
web page .  The IMC has established an eSNACC mail list which is used to: distribute information regarding eSNACC releases; discuss related issues; and provide a means for integrators to provide feedback, comments,
bug reports, etc.  Subscription information for the imc-snacc
mail list is at the IMC web site listed above.
We welcome all feedback regarding the eSNACC software.
If bugs are reported, then we will investigate each reported
bug and, if required, will produce a patch or an updated
release of the software to repair the bug. This release announcement was sent to several mail lists,
but please send all messages regarding the eSNACC software to the imc-snacc mail list ONLY.  Please do not send messages regarding the eSNACC software to any of the IETF mail lists.  We will respond to all messages sent to the

Getronics Government Solutions has delivered a set of patch files
(Patch A) that fix bugs (see below) in the v2.0.1 S/MIME Freeware Library (SFL) source code.  The SFL source code files are freely
available at .  The SFL implements the IETF S/MIME v3 RFC 2630 Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) and RFC 2634 Enhanced Security Services (ESS) specifications. It also implements portions of the RFC 2633 Message Specification and RFC 2632 Certificate Handling document.  When used in conjunction with
the Crypto++ freeware library, the SFL implements the RFC 2631 Diffie-Hellman (D-H) Key Agreement Method specification.  It has been successfully tested using the Microsoft (MS) Windows NT/98/2000/XP, Linux
and Sun Solaris 2.8 operating systems.  Further enhancements, ports and testing of the SFL are still in process.  Further releases of the SFL
will be provided as significant capabilities are added. The SFL has been successfully used to sign, verify, encrypt and decrypt CMS/ESS objects using: DSA, E-S D-H, 3DES algorithms provided by the Crypto++ library; RSA suite of algorithms provided by the RSA BSAFE 6.0
Crypto-C and Crypto++ libraries; and Fortezza suite of algorithms provided
by the Fortezza Crypto Card.  The v2.0.1 (Patch A) SFL uses the v1.3 R10
Enhanced SNACC (eSNACC) ASN.1 C++ Library to encode/decode objects. The v2.0.1 SFL release includes: SFL High-level library; Free (a.k.a. Crypto++) Crypto Token Interface Library (CTIL); BSAFE CTIL;
Fortezza CTIL; SPEX/ CTIL; PKCS  CTIL; Microsoft CAPI v2.0 CTIL; test utilities; test drivers; and test data.  All CTILs were tested as Dynamically Linked Libraries (DLL) using MS Windows.  The Fortezza, BSAFE
and Crypto++ CTILs were tested with the respective security libraries as
shared objects using Linux and Solaris 2.8.  The SFL has been successfully used to exchange signedData and envelopedData messages with the MS Internet Explorer Outlook Express v4.01, Netscape
Communicator 4.X, Entrust and Baltimore S/MIME products.  Signed messages
have been exchanged with the RSA S/MAIL and WorldTalk S/MIME v2 products. The SFL has also been used to perform S/MIME v3 interoperability testing
with Microsoft that exercised the majority of the features specified by RFCs 2630, 2631 and 2634.  This testing included the RSA, DSA, E-S D-H, 3DES, SHA
and Fortezza algorithms.  We used the SFL to successfully process the SFL-supported sample data included in the S/MIME WG "Examples of S/MIME Messages" document.  We also used the SFL to generate S/MIME v3 sample messages that were included in the "Examples" document.
The use of the v2.0.1 SFL is described in the v2.0 SFL Application Programming Interface (API) and v2.0 SDD documents.  The v2.0 SMP Components Setup Manual that describes the component installation
procedures for the v2.0.1 SFL, v2.0.1 Certificate Management Library (CML),
and v1.3 R10 eSNACC libraries.  The use of the v2.0.1 CTIL API is
described in the v2.0 CTIL API document. Patch A includes the following enhancements (compared to v2.0.1 SFL
and CTIL releases):
1) v2.0.1 (Patch A) SFL was tested using v1.3 R10 eSNACC ASN.1 C++ library
that fixed a bug in the code that implements the SET OF sorting as part
of the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER).  The eSNACC DER bug was causing the SFL to report signature verification problems when attempting
to verify valid signed S/MIME messages.
2) v2.0.1 (Patch A) SFL was tested using v1.3 R10 eSNACC ASN.1 C++ library
that also includes a bug fix that resulted in a significant decrease in the
time required to decode objects greater than 1MB in size.  For example, this
eSNACC bug fix resulted in a 300-fold improvement in the SFL decryption of
objects that are greater than 1MB in size.
3) Fixed bugs in Microsoft CAPI CTIL code that handles the use of two
RSA certificates (and corresponding private keys) that include the same
subject name, but are distinguished by the keyUsage extension (one for signature, one for encryption).  4) The SFL timing routine was updated in the sm_EDTImingTest.cpp test utility to time variable loop counter of messages of variable content size.  This test now handles ASN.1 Encode, Decode, Encrypt and Decrypt
tests (./SMIME/testsrc/util/sm_EDTImingTest.cpp). 5) SFL and Microsoft CAPI CTIL were updated to fix minor memory leaks
and other minor bugs.
6) Corrected bug in CertNameToStr (sm_capi.cpp) to process names longer than 100 characters.
7) Improved CertificateBuilder by adding a separate certificatePolicies
extension creation menu item.  8) The demonstration program in ./SMIME/testutil/testTripleWrap has been updated to demonstrate multiple certificate loads into RecipientInfos for encryption.  This program also demonstrates the
Microsoft CAPI CTIL initialization and usage.
We are still in the process of enhancing and testing the SFL.  Future releases may include: additional PKCS  CTIL testing; finish CertificateBuilder command line utility; enhancing CertificateBuilder to support creation of Attribute Certificates; add "Certificate Management Messages over CMS" ASN.1 encode/decode functions; add enhanced test routines; bug fixes; support for other crypto APIs; and support for other operating systems. The SFL is developed to maximize portability to 32-bit operating systems.  In addition to testing on MS Windows, Linux and Solaris 2.8, we may port the SFL to other operating systems.
The following SFL files are available from 1) SFL Documents: Fact Sheet, Software Design Description, API, CTIL API, Software Test Description, Implementers Guide, Overview Briefing
and Public License.     2) smimeR2.0.1.tar.gz:  Source code, MS Windows project files and Unix makefiles for SFL Hi-Level library.
3) snacc13r10rn.tar.gz (source code and binaries available from Getronics eSNACC web page: ): Source code, MS Windows project files and Unix makefiles for

enhancements to v2.0.1 SFL, Microsoft CAPI CTIL, CertificateBuilder.
All source code for the SFL is being provided at no cost and with no financial limitations regarding its use and distribution. Organizations can use the SFL without paying any royalties or licensing fees.  Getronics is developing the SFL under contract to the U.S. Government.  The U.S. Government is furnishing the SFL
source code at no cost to the vendor subject to the conditions of the "SFL Public License".
On 14 January 2000, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration published a new regulation implementing an update to the U.S. Government's encryption export policy .  In accordance with the revisions to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) of 14 Jan 2000, the downloading of the SFL source code is not password controlled.
The SFL is composed of a high-level library that performs generic CMS and ESS processing independent of the crypto algorithms used to protect a specific object.  The SFL high-level library makes calls to an algorithm-independent CTIL API.  The underlying, external crypto
token libraries are not distributed as part of the SFL source code. The application developer must independently obtain these libraries and then link them with the SFL.  The SFL uses the CML and eSNACC ASN.1 Library to encode/decode
certificates, ACs, CRLs and components thereof.  The CML is freely
available at: .
The SFL has been successfully tested in conjunction with the Access
Control Library (ACL) that is freely available to everyone from: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is providing test S/MIME messages (created by Getronics) at .  Getronics used the SFL to successfully process the NIST test data.
NIST is using the SFL and CML as part of the NIST S/MIME Test Facility (NSMTF) that they are planning to host (see ).  Vendors will be able to use
the NSMTF to help determine if their products comply with the
IETF S/MIME v3 specifications and the Federal S/MIME v3 Client Profile.  The SFL has been integrated into many applications to provide CMS/ESS
security services.  For example, the SFL was integrated into a security
plug-in for a commercial e-mail application that enabled the application to meet the Bridge Certification Authority Demonstration Phase II requirements including implementing ESS features such as
security labels.
The Internet Mail Consortium (IMC) has established an SFL web page
.  The IMC has also established an SFL
mail list which is used to: distribute information regarding SFL
releases; discuss SFL-related issues; and provide a means for SFL
users to provide feedback, comments, bug reports, etc.  Subscription
information for the imc-sfl mailing list is at the IMC web site
listed above.
All comments regarding the SFL source code and documents are welcome.  This SFL release announcement was sent to several mail lists, but please send all messages regarding the SFL to the imc-sfl mail list ONLY.  Please do not send messages regarding the SFL to any of the IETF mail lists.  We will respond to all messages sent to the imc-sfl mail John Pawling, John.Pawling

Losing your cool, though, is swell, for it is a sign of advancement over over over-false-confidence and the yearning to have gotten matters of the world right once and for all. Nothing more crippling than a desire to be free of doubt, but that desire is a salient characteristic of those who are recruited into privileged circles: a promise of access to privileged information and behavior is the bait, the trap is never being able to talk about how sleight the secrets are, and how shitty the insiders treat one another,
to anyone outside the magic circle. All secret societies fear

David Kahn made such an argument when he refused
to sign a confidentiality agreement for NSA  in order
to have access to classified archives. According to Kahn
he was the first to refuse that faustian arrangement
(pun intended, Faustine). Instead he sat at a desk
outside the classified archives and worked only
with material that did not require an NDA, doing so,
he said, in order to help assure reader trust of his
Kahn's right, and admirably so, for once you get access
to classified material you  are doomed to be distrusted
outside the secret world. Too much lying has been done
by those who have access for anybody with access
to ever be trusted, which, no doubt, is the intention of
those who believe in privileged information. You are

acupuncturists, and not least, journalists who may pretend to authorize themselves but behave in accord with the rules of their privileged publishers.

It is likely that Cryptome and the Net will be used to spread
disinfo, as with predecessor means of information spread.
What better way to contaminate citizen tools than to
try to make them unreliable compared to official sources.
Dotty Rumsfeld is certainly practicing that with relish, rather
being used for that purpose by smarter people who used
Reagan and other big-smile dotters similarly.
Even without disinfo, sources of information of all kinds
need a beady eye and skeptical mind. One of a series
we're assembling is on protection from explosives now
that digital terrorism has been diminished by 9/11 and
attention has returned to physical security of the homeland.
We've looked at some of the homeland security opportunism of professionals in the built environment field -- engineers,
architects, builders, real estate promoters, banks, insurance --
and see that they are advocating restriction of information
on protective measures to professionals and those entrusted
to camouflage scary threats from the citizenry reassure against panic. This smells of protection racket which parallels the early argument for restricting crypto to specialists and
hiding Net security threats from trusting users.
Here's a link to a group of building associations set
up in March to aid homeland security:
  Here's a link to architects promotion of work
on homeland security:
  However, some more seasoned parties say that it's time
to share sensitive technology for protecting the physical
infrastructure more broadly as the homeland comes under increasing threat. That military-grade protective measures
need to be more widely known and incorporated into
building codes and construction practices. It is expected
that this could take up to 10 years to become effective,
to rewrite codes, to retrain current professionals, to blend into professional students' curricula, to adjust budgets for safer construction.
Blast Mitigation for Structures (1999)
  Protecting Buildings From Bomb Damage (1995)
  So what is to be done in the meantime? We think more information
on self-protection needs to be disseminated, following the
crypto model, to liberate classified and restricted documents
and foster development of practices which do not require
state-licensed professionals to implement.
We expect there will be bitching about putting dangerous
information on the Net for amateurs to blow up themselves
and neighbors, and rightly so, for it is needed to offset the soothing and deliberately scary disinfo associated with
relying upon trusted parties who never quite live up to
their promises to protect and hinder access to means
of self-protection.

UNCONFIRMED LEAD -- this March 26, 2002 letter on small arms reportedly came from a soldier assigned to an infantry unit in Afghanistan, following the letter is commentary that was attached to the email we received:
  "The current-issue 62gr 5.56mm (223) round, especially when fired from
  the short-barreled, M-4 carbine, is proving itself (once again) to be
  woefully inadequate as man stopper.  Engagements at all ranges are   requiring multiple, solid hits to permanently bring down enemy   soldiers.
  Penetration is also sadly deficient.  Even light barriers are not   perforated by this rifle/cartridge combination.  Troopers all over are   switching to the seventy-seven grain Sierra Matchking (loaded by Black   Hills) whenever it can be found.  Its performance on enemy soldiers is   not much better, but it does penetrate barriers.  We're fighting   fanatics here, and they don't find wimpy ammunition particularly   impressive!
  Adding to our challenges, our issue M-9 pistol (Beretta M92F) is proving   itself unreliable. They are constantly breaking.  To make matters worse,   the 9mm hardball round we use is a joke.  It is categorically   ineffective as a fight stopper, even at close range.  Some troopers,   after numerous, desperate requests, are now being reissued 1911s!   However, the only ones available for issue are worn out.  Magazines are   hard to find, and 45ACP ammunition is scarce.
  We are frustrated here that none of the forgoing seems to be of the
  slightest concern to people in Washington. It is a damn good thing that
  we have air superiority and are not yet heavily engaged on the ground.
  Inferior weapons and ammunition are making us all nervous."
Lesson: Here we go again!  We're going into war with small arms and
ammunition we know to be impotent and (in the case of the M-9 pistol)
lacking in durability.  What makes the iniquity even worse is that these inadequacies have all been common knowledge since the Gulf War ten years During WW1, American troopers were issued a French light, automatic
rifle, as part of an economic sweetheart deal with the French.  The gun, called the CSRG (Chauchat), was notoriously unreliable, and that fact was well known by Americans and French alike.  But, it was issued anyway, and we will never know how many Americans were needlessly killed as a result.
That this kind of casual nonchalance is apparently still standard procedure at the Pentagon, is disillusioning.  We really haven't come very far in eighty-five years.  Our young men, in the minds of politicians and military brass alike, are still cannon fodder!

Frederick Kagan, a historian at the US Military Academy,

More than double its defense expenditures; Ignore the Europeans and other allies due to their military ineffectuality and insufficient defense budgets;
Prepare for long-term US military dominance of the world;
Accept that the US will have to combat enemies more or less on its own;
Reduce governmental spending for non-national security Accept that war is never going away or diminish but evolve
into unprecedented forms;
Beef up HUMINT and decrease reliance upon intelligence analysis which cannot process the flood of data acquired by
non-human means;
Increase foreign aid to relieve the problems which lead to easy recruitment for anti-American movements;
Not count on the Air Force and Navy for wars of the future -- which will not be primarily with enemies which are not
defeatable by air and sea; Destroy any nation which provides a base for terrorism.
Understand that ground troops are the only way to secure lasting peace;
Professor Kagan said that he graduated as a Soviet
specialist just as the Cold War ended and had to quickly
develop a new specialty: advancing the cause of the US Army as if the survival of the United States hinged on it.
The audience applauded Kagan's candor when he said I
assume since all of you are Princeton graduates you
work for large corporations. And large corporations do
not respond well to criticism or cut-backs, in fact, they
become less effective when resources are withdrawn
and long-established methods are challenged. Members
become fearful and even more ineffective under duress.
Kagan said, what needs to be done to ineffective large organizations is to provide them with more resources and affirmation of how they have long done things. This will reassure the corporations' members that they are appreciated, will boost their morale and confidence, and increase the quality of their output.
Kagan said many of the United States' foreign policy
failures are traceable to the Democrats, then paused,
and said, you know I mean Clinton and Clinton's
holdovers in government who continue to argue for
cut backs in defense spending in favor of more support
for domestic programs. This is clearly wrong, Kagan said, and only fools believe the enemy is not at home.

The phrase "for all practical purposes" may well be sufficient
for engineers, or scientists, needing to fulfill requirements of
a task, say, to get out the door a workable cryptosystem,
whether for the market or national security purposes. This
criterion of practicality is what stumped the British
cryptographers who needed a secure means to transmit
keys. After finding no practical solution the problem was
handed off to Ellis who was known to be the most impractical
dreamer at BP. Ellis brooded on the problem and eventually
arrived at a scheme which delighted the practical folks but
which they could not have imagined.
Still there was a practical problem with implementing
Ellis's scheme and his discovery languished until the
problem was handed off to Cocks, newly arrived at BP,
and one of the least experienced there, that is, the least
able, like Ellis to be practically effective. Cocks came
up with a solution that finally made PK workable but which
even Ellis could not imagine.
We've noted here before that we made an FOIA request
to NSA in November 2000 for information on what was known in the agency about NPE before Diffie-Hellman-Merkle announced their discovery/invention of PK. The agency
first responded that the material was so voluminous that
I would need to narrow the time frame to get an early
response. For this I picked the year of Ellis's discovery, with subsequent requests to spring off that. This took place a short while before 9/11.
I thought 9/11 would halt the process but it did not: a letter
from NSA on 9/18 said the requested year's material was being assembled. (We had earlier paid a search fee of $5,000). NSA would not say when the first NPE batch will be sent nor what will be in it. The stuff may be only pages of redactions.
As far as I know nobody has requested NPE material from NSA, or at least made it public. Steve Levy in "Crypto" says
that Diffie may have gotten a nudge from somebody associated
with NSA for a direction to take, but what that was is not
One can wonder, though, that if NSA knew about NPE why
Diffie-Hellman-Merkle's work was not classified at birth.
One can ponder the long-running deception of Crypto AG
in planting highly reputable crypto machines around the globe with a NSA backdoor in them.
One can ponder why a similar, reputable, crypto-mathematical deception is also not widely distributed, burnished with tales
of impregnability.
David Kahn, among others, writes such deceptions are
so venerable only a fool would trust a wholly trustworthy
cryptosystem. And notes that practicality often requires
faulty systems be continually slathered with faith to
assure acceptance.

Agreed that there may well be ways to access cyphertext that
does not attack its crypto-mathematical shield, which could
indeed be practically invulnerable.
What gets pondered, surely, in the same way Ellis, Cocks,
Diffie, Hellman and Name noodled the PK challenge, is what
would such an access be through or around practically
invulnerable algorithms. Not the electronic, DFA, and other
now known attacks, but a mathematical breakthrough, say,
following the unprecedented model of PK.
The release of the Ellis/Cock paper on Non-Secret Encryption
is intriguing. Why was it released, not for the reasons given
at the time but perhaps others. One might imagine, in the
paranoid spirit of good cryptologists, that the release was
intended to divert attention away from X, for example, to
encourage public trust in PK as with the Germans and
What though might be the Achilles heel of PK that is not
protected by any key strength? That increase of key strength
is meant to enhance false confidence about? And what if
the promotion of implementation vulnerabilities is part
of the diversion? That the weakness is neither known
mathematical nor implementation nor the other well-
publicized attacks.
A mathemetician given this problem would surely not
accept failure as the outcome: mathematicians are
nuts for the impossible, the unsolvable.
Wondrous would be that PK is weak precisely where
it is believed to be strongest but not in a way readily
grasped by those who have faith in the strength, that
ever Enigmatic vainglory sustained by the refusal
to give up legacy assurance when challenged by
novelty, or worse, seduced by A Beautiful Mind.

Lucky is to be commended for igniting a neglected aspect
of the crypto wars: what happens to cryptosystems over
time after they have been invented, tested, criticized, vetted and conditionally trusted, then gradually widely distributed
as the best available under practical usage, then compromised
by direct attack or undermining from within -- the cycle of all
previous cryptosystems.
This inevitable vulnerability comes about for the reason
Lucky states: sloppiness, laziness, inattention to keeping
up with new means of attack, desire to exploit markets
based on widespread public and institutional trust,
and, not least, succumbing to the stigma of "being too

of cryptosystems dread gradual decline in their
successive implementations, if they continue to care
about security and are not enjoying the economic
fruits of success and to hell with authentic security,
so what if there are a few hundred victims, collateral
damage, think big, think Wall Street.
Any well-known and trusted cryptosystem should be
highly suspect of being compromised, and total reliance
upon it is immensely foolhardy. That is why no "military
grade" cryptosystem is wholly trusted by the military
in times of war or when war is threatening, which now
means all the time.
If you are at war with government no government-approved
cryptosystem is to be trusted, which means no system
in most countries and certainly not in the US. And no
commercially successful cryptosystem is to be wholly
trusted for its success rests in part on its acceptance
by government -- still the prime purchaser of such
systems and maker of markets.
We will learn someday of currently trusted systems,
as we have of those in the past, more or less when they
were compromised. "More or less" reflects that the
greatest cryptosystem deceptions of the past 100
years are still classified and will remain so in order
to not disturb blind faith in accessible, practical Without blind faith in comsec, intelligence gathering
would be much more difficult for few would transmit
their most valuable secrets via trusted systems.

implementations, remain vulnerable to weaknesses
of their correspondents' usage -- who may quote
Lucky's transmittal in response, send it to others
without Lucky knowing, tamper with his information,
violate his trust wittingly or otherwise.
One could argue that the increased use of crypto has
enhanced intelligence gathering despite government
protests widely disseminated to induce trust in the
systems, again as with prior deceptions.
Too little sustained testing of trusted systems is
done in the private realm, and there too little skepticism
of widely used systems by enthusiasts and market

In the first part of the paper we analyse the scheme, explain why the two parties converge to a common key, and why an attacker using a similar neural network is unlikely to converge to the same key. However, in the second part of the paper we show that this key exchange protocol can be broken in three different ways, and thus it is completely insecure.   3.

From the TSCM mail list, 18 May 2002:
Forwarded from a law enforcement newsletter
NEW GENERATION CELL PHONE 'AUTO-ANSWER' COULD TIP OFF POTENTIAL SUSPECTS
It has been brought to our attention that many new generation cellular phones have an 'auto-answer' feature that allows the phone to answer a call automatically without the user's physical contact. Apparently, this feature is designed for 'hands free' operation for disabled individuals, and individuals operating their phones while driving.  Further, it was posted in a Louisiana State Police Special Bulletin (dated May 2) that DEA contacts in New York have received reports from agents that their CI's know of drug gang members who are indeed aware of this feature and use it to gather intelligence from law enforcement.  "They will allow themselves to be picked up and then 'leave' a phone in their vehicle to gather intelligence from them later or they will secretly hide a phone in an officer's vehicle or in a spot that they know that law enforcement gathers at to glean intelligence," the bulletin reads.  Further, an April 2 edition of the bulletin detailed a scenario involving one of these cellular phones, but at the time the Louisiana State Police were unable to confirm the origin of the scenario. However, representatives from the department told Xxxxxx that they have since been contacted by the Phelps County (Missouri) Sheriff's Department identifying that department as the origin for the scenario.  The scenario featured a Nextel phone, in particular, that was found in a truck that officers were searching. There were 65 pounds of marijuana in the sleeper.  During the search, the cellular phone began ringing while it sat in the holster on the dashboard. When the phone stopped ringing, the officers assumed that voicemail kicked in, however, they learned later that the phone was set in auto-answer. The caller was the intended recipient of the marijuana. Incidentally, he was able to overhear the officers during their search of the vehicle.  Not only did this give away details of the search to the individual on the phone, but it also potentially jeopardized the safety of the officers.  Louisiana State Police has confirmed the details of the auto-sound feature through Nextel. The feature can be accessed by pressing the * key and then the # key.  Then hit the arrow key until you see the auto-answer option.  You can also find out whether or not the feature is actually on, and you can program how many rings it will take to activate it, or to ring silently.  As stated in the Louisiana State Police Special Bulletin, April 2 edition: "This is a potentially serious threat to agents especially in a controlled delivery environment. Always check cell phones to make sure what kind they are. Be especially careful of Nextel phones when found and make sure the auto-answer feature is turned off or at least no one says anything near it that can be heard and tip off a potential suspect."  We have sent this warning out strictly to inform you of the POTENTIAL danger you could face if you find yourself in a similar situation. The phone itself poses no threat, but as with any device featured in our Weapons Warnings, in the hands of the wrong people it could be used in a potentially dangerous way. Specifically, these phones could be used as a communication device that could release official law enforcement information to a potential suspect.  Steve Uhrig, SWS Security, Maryland (USA)

Today I received the government's response to my 2255 Motion to the
Federal District Court to take responsibility for the extreme injustices and
abrogation of Justice, in general, and the Constitution, in particular, during
the conduct of my arrest, trial and prosecution, and asked them to vacate
my convictions and sentence.
This, of course, will not happen.  It will not happen because THEY [TM]
have no sense of decency, justice, or shame and have no reason to fear
that even the most documentable and provable malfeasance on their part,
in the name of Justice, nonetheless, will make even the slightest dent in
the consciousness or consciensces of the general public.
Upon my release from prison, it was with heartfelt appreciation that I read
posts made to the Cypherpunks list around the time of my trial where
a number of individuals expressed both the desire and willingness to take
time out of their lives to attend my trial and to bear first-hand witness to
what was taking place, in the name of Justice, as the result of an
investigation that Jeff Gordon testified, under oath, that he had undertaken as a direct result of his role in the government's monitoring of the Cypherpunks list and the individuals on it, due to the serious threat that
the free speech and support of privacy and encryption issues poses
to the government.
He also stated that his investigation of me began as a result of a single
email to Jim Bell--an email that contained nothing more nor less than
a single chapter of a work of fiction, 'InfoWar,' which was sent to
Mr. Bell by the Author for the purpose of his reviewing it to ensure
that the portion of the work which dealt with his 'Assassination
Politics' article accurately reflected the concept.
It is thus logical to assume that it is entirely possible that each and
every member of the Cypherpunks list, and others, who had occasion
to communicate with Mr. Bell also became the subject of a government
investigation based first and foremost on THEIR [TM] desire to suppress and eliminate the perceived threat they felt from American
citizens exercising their Constitutional right to distribute and discuss
a document which is fully protected by the First Amendment.
I am proud to say that it can be found in the Court record that I spoke up
loudly when the government produced a witness list designed for the express purpose of denying Cypherpunks and members of my family
their right to attend the trial, by placing people they never intended to
call on the witness list and then asking that the 'witnesses' all be barred
from attending the trial.
I stated boldly for the record that this was exactly what they were doing,
and was proven right. This was, of course, actually proved to *nobody*
since the government was successful in keeping the trial an affair which was
not attended by anybody, as a result of both their arrogant malfeasance in
using their witness list as a weapon to negate the rights of the individuals
involved, and by their parallel massive assault, via a Grand Jury, on Cypherpunk William Geiger III, for daring to make a perfectly legal post
to the Cypherpunks list which was a most appropos illustration of a
point which I had intended to raise at the trial, and which, in fact, could and should have been introduced as valid evidence in my case.
The government's actions in this regard, combined with the Grand Jury
records, make it perfectly clear that the purpose of the whole affair was
blatant intimidation of William Geiger III, et al, since it was convened
only for the purpose of eliciting information that was already known to
the government, and concluded with no action being taken because
there never was any actionable cause at it's basis in the first place.
Jeff Gordon is not a subtle man, because he has no need to be, and it
would, in fact, interfere with his agenda of forceful intimidation of those
who pose a threat of exercising their free speech in any matter that
might support justice for those he is trying to imprison.
Jeff Gordon knews full well that his pointed question as to whether
Cypherpunk Adam Back ever travels to the U.S. would be a very
clear threat that Mr. Backs superbe effort in leading an excercise to provide
solid proof of a mathematical signed-key concept that could be used
to obtain justice on my behalf could result in his receiving the same
arrogant and high-handed treatment as William Geiger III and thus
find himself faced with a Grand Jury investigation for performing a
perfectly legal act that interfered with Jeff Gordon and Robb London's
Then there is John Young.  The tape recordings of the trial will make it
blatantly clear to anyone who listens to them that Jeff Gordon, in speaking
John Young's name (in the process of, wholly without proof, 'accusing' Mr. Young of performing the most abhorrent of perfectly legal actions)
literally *spits* out John Young's name with a venomous contempt and
hatred that was so powerful that it almost convinced even me to leap from
my seat and publically call for John Young's prosecution and hanging for
this unsubstantiated 'accusation' of Mr. Young having commited this
most dreadful of Perfectly Legal Crimes [TM].
It saddens me very much to have to say that, early in my trial, when I
still held out faint hope that I might still be allowed my constitutional
to mount a defense to the charges against me, I had to seriously consider
whether I should refrain from calling as witnesses certain Cypherpunks
and others who could provide valid evidence useful to my defense, for
the simple reason that doing so would expose them to the malfeasant
wrath of government agents Gordon and London.
As it turned out, this did not become an issue, since I had, against my will and in violation of my constitutional rights, an unwanted public
defender appointed to abrogate my rights and prevent any possibility
of my mounting any defense to the charges against me.
Judge Bryan has set a May 21, 2002, court date for the hearing of my
2255 Petition to the court.

Officials, and journalists, accustomed to handling civil unrest
through police means, have to stretch to get their hands on
national security threats, in particular what to do with military
capabilities which are scaled for much greater threats than
the police can handle.
The military doesn't like civil affairs where a distinction has
to be made between innocents and opponents, where a battle
has to be fought while civil affairs continue. It blows whole
areas away, hardly affected by collateral damage laments.
Some military commentators have reported that th 9/11
losses are barely significant in military terms, but are a
big hit for police-scale mentality, and even bigger for
political mindsets which fear loss of face more than all
Terrorism thrives by remaining less than a military-scale
threat but is becoming more than police, and police-minded
officials and journalists like Friedman can handle can handle.
A nuke on DC or NYC could lead all of them to grow up,
a favorite theme of the Times these days about Silicon
The Times some months ago, by way of Jeffifer Lee, reported
on the fervor with with which high-tech firms are racing to
capitalize on the requirements for homeland security and
the rise in military actions, redefining product lines, digging
out civilian ideas for re-uniforming in national security
dress. Perhaps that is what Friedman is doing, scaling
up the picayune Palestinian dust-up to a global affair,
as he has tried futilely to do for years but failing due to
the required emphasis on its Jewish attribute for the
New York City readership yet paying the price of indifference
Friedman regularly these days predicts a series of suicide
bombings in New York City, and as a sidebar elsewhere in
the US. That police scale he is good at, but the military
scale of widespread carnage appears beyond his comprehension --
in the spirit of the once-isolated and comfortably insulated USA.
The problem with dismissing the drumbeat of terrorist alarms
is that the guardians could well let a few attacks happen to show
the citizenry the neeed to show respect for government. This is
not to suggest that 9/11 was such an attention-getting operation
but it certainly has fulfilled the dreams of those who warned
about it and are now reaping its benefits -- gov, mil, com and edu.

Thomas Friedman in the New York Times today:
Webbed, Wired and Worried, May 26, 2002
I've been wondering how the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley were looking at the 9/11 tragedy; whether it was giving them
 any pause about the wired world they've been building and the assumptions they are building it upon. In a recent visit to Stanford University and Silicon Valley, I had a chance to pose these questions to techies. I found at least some of their libertarian, technology-will-solve-everything cockiness was gone. I found a much keener awareness that the unique web of technologies Silicon Valley was building before 9/11 -- from the Internet to powerful encryption software -- can be incredible force multipliers for individuals and small groups to do both good and evil. And I found an acknowledgment that all those technologies had been built with a high degree of trust as to how they would be used, and that that trust had been shaken. In its place is a greater appreciation that high-tech companies aren't just threatened by their competitors; but also by some of their users.
It was part of Silicon Valley lore that successful innovations would follow a well-trodden path: beginning with early adopters, then early mass-appeal users and finally the mass market. But it's clear now there is also a parallel,
criminal path: starting with the early perverters of a new technology up to the really twisted perverters. For instance, the 9/11 hijackers may have communicated globally through steganography software, which lets users e-mail, say, a baby picture that secretly contains a 300-page compressed document or even a voice message.
"We have engineered large parts of our system on an assumption of trust that may no longer be accurate," said a Stanford law professor, Joseph A. Grundfest. "Trust is hard-wired into everything from computers to the Internet to building codes. What kind of building codes you need depends on what kind of risks you thought were out there. The odds of someone flying a passenger jet into a tall building were zero before. They're not anymore. The whole objective of the terrorists is to reduce our trust in all the normal instruments and technologies we use in daily life. You wake up in the morning and trust that you can get to work across the Brooklyn Bridge -- don't. This is particularly
dangerous because societies which have a low degree of trust are backward societies."
Silicon Valley staunchly opposed the Clipper Chip, which would have given the government a back-door key to all U.S. encrypted data. Now some wonder whether they shouldn't have opposed it. John Doerr, the venture capitalist, said, "Culturally, the Valley was already maturing before 9/11, but since then it's definitely developed a deeper respect for leaders and government

All-American Osamas
Nicholas Kristof
Militia members and Al Qaeda members are remarkably similar. Both are galvanized by religious extremism (America's militias overlap with the Christian Identity movement, which preaches that Jews are the children of Satan and that people of color are sub-human), both see the United States government as utterly evil, and both are empowered by the information revolution that enables them to create networks, recruit disciples and trade recipes for bio- and chemical weapons.
It would be a mistake to put one's faith in the militias' eternal incompetence. Jessica Stern of Harvard has written about an anti-government activist named James Dalton Bell, who earned a degree in chemistry from M.I.T. and is unquestionably brilliant. By age 14, he says, "I was studying the isomerization of benzyl thiocyanate to the isocyanate."
Weren't we all? But Mr. Bell, who is now in jail, is also believed by the authorities to have manufactured sarin, a nerve gas, in his basement. He led a chemical attack against an I.R.S. office and wrote an Internet book called "Assassination Politics," which outlines a very clever scheme to pay for contract killings of federal officials with digital cash in a way that preserves anonymity at both ends. There is also evidence that Mr. Bell talked "hypothetically" of poisoning a city's water supply.

    (108KB)
Revisions and Clarifications to Encryption Controls in the Export
Administration Regulations--Implementation of Changes in Category 5,
Part 2 (``Information Security''), of the Wassenaar Arrangement List of
Dual-Use Goods and Other Technologies
SUMMARY: This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
to reflect changes made to the Wassenaar Arrangement List of dual-use
items, and to update and clarify other provisions of the EAR pertaining
to encryption export controls. Consistent with the Wassenaar changes,
Note No. 3 (``Cryptography Note'') to Category 5--part II (Information
Security) of the Commerce Control List (CCL) is amended to allow mass
market treatment for all encryption products, including products with
symmetric algorithms employing key lengths greater than 64-bits, that
previously were not eligible for mass market treatment. As a result,
for the first time, mass market encryption commodities and software
with symmetric key lengths exceeding 64 bits may be exported and
reexported to most destinations without a license under Export Control
Classification Numbers (ECCNs) 5A992 and 5D992, following a 30-day
review by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) (formerly the
Bureau of Export Administration (BXA)). In addition, this rule, for the
first time, allows equipment controlled under ECCN 5B002 to be exported
and reexported under License Exception ENC. For all other information
security items, including encryption source code that would be
considered publicly available, this rule updates and clarifies existing
notification, review, licensing and post-export reporting requirements.
Restrictions on exports and reexports of encryption items to terrorist-
supporting states (Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and
Syria), their nationals and other sanctioned persons (individuals and
entities) are not changed by this rule.
DATES: This rule is effective June 6, 2002.

Bear in mind that the holders of US debts do not want the debts
paid, only the interest, and in fact want both to increase as they
have consistently since the US government went into hock.
A prime reason holders of US debt fear other countries defaulting
on their debt is that that might become a promising political campaign
in the US where debt of all kinds are glorified and where unpaid debts
are the greatest sins so long as the debts are owed by the USG and
credit card, family home and car, debtors.
Gigantic debts by well to do are signs of accomplishment and no
wealthy person wants to be large-debt-free. Instead what is wanted is
a top-notch credit rating, that is desirable to be an debtor who can
call for whatever is needed at the moment without expending the
small amount of cash on hand, which is called pocket change.
The biggest debtors are the super rich, and their combined debts
exceed that of the US Government. Such debts are customarily
called investments purchased with borrowed money or other
forms of investments. These superwealthy schemes based on
superimpositions are very large Ponzi schemes, nearly all of which rely up government underwriting either by permissable
law or by assurance of bail-out -- not surprisingly as a last
resort to claim national security is at stake, or even less
surprising, require war to thin the complainers of small
debts and to boost war industry replenishment of large
fortunes. Nothing peculiar about the US doing this, for it
is what governments were invented for: to assure continued
well-being for the favored while promising a chicken in every
for the starving and promising as well that the starving must
work for the chicken freely stolen by the wealthy.
Capitalism didn't begin this dreadful state of affairs, it merely
copied more brazen versions and cloaked its intentions with
simulated democracy, sometimes smirkingly called free market forces by its beneficiaries. Getting the small debtors to lust after Wall Street is  nothing compared to getting them drunk with patriotism so they'll send their idiot off-spring to kill those hungry like themselves while George slurps Hagen-Daas from Condi's navel.
The key to success is getting the really smart hungry people
to feed your mind and gut and wipe your ass while believing like national security teams they are really in charge. How do you

In the September Atlantic Monthly Bruce Schneier explains
yet again why cryptography is not the solution to security;
what's needed are private cyber cops like his:
  Amazing how Bruce's philosopy matches that of those
he once combated in the "crypto wars." He recants crypto
security to remind that there is never to be found lasting
security, as with the TLAs worldwide, except by well-paid
vigilance of those who know best how to protect us. He may be right, or he may smell Starbucks.
When I asked Schneier why Counterpane had such Darth
Vaderish command centers, he laughed and said it
helped to reassure potential clients that the company had
mastered the technology. I asked if clients ever inquired
how Counterpane trains the guards and analysts in the
command centers. "Not often," he said, although that
training is in fact the center of the whole system. Mixing
long stretches of inactivity with short bursts of frenzy,
the work rhythm of the Counterpane guards would have
been familiar to police officers and firefighters
everywhere. As I watched the guards, they were slurping
soft drinks, listening to techno-death metal, and waiting
for something to go wrong. They were in a protected
space, looking out at a dangerous world. Sentries around
Neolithic campfires did the same thing. Nothing better
has been discovered since. Thinking otherwise, in
Schneier's view, is a really terrible idea. Heroes, by god, what we need are more poster boy heroes.

not to come across as an accomplished, striving star-sucker.

[Excerpt. There are 15 images in the patent.]
Anonymity Server, May 14, 2002
1. Field
The present invention relates to the field of communications. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for maintaining anonymous and traffic analysis resistant communications over a communication link.
2. Related Art
Over the last few years, personal and commercial usage of the Internet has increased dramatically. As a result, companies are beginning to monitor such usage for a number of reasons. For example, marketing companies can analyze Internet traffic in order to develop consumer profiles of various users or to obtain information about ongoing projects by a competitive company.
In an attempt to thwart data collection through traffic analysis and provide message anonymity over public communication links like the Internet, anonymous remailers are now being provided. An "anonymous remailer" is a computer that
receives an electronic message over a communication link from a sender and redirects that electronic message to an intended recipient. By encrypting audible and/or viewable data of the electronic message, the integrity and confidentiality of that data would be protected against unauthorized access
by the operator of the anonymous remailer or an interloper.
It is evident that the above-described conventional communication scheme would substantially ensure the preservation of the integrity and confidentiality of data within an electronic message. However, this conventional communication scheme fails to protect the integrity or confidentiality of data transmitted back to the original sender in the form of a response from the intended
In certain situations, anonymous remailers have been configured to assign a unique tag to each original sender of an electronic message before the electronic message is redirected to the intended recipient. This tag is used as a secret key by the intended recipient to encrypt data contained in a response to the electronic message. However, to support this communication scheme, the anonymous remailer would have to decrypt the response with the
tag and re-encrypt the response with the public key of the original sender because the intended recipient would have no knowledge of the original sender, namely a public key of the original sender. Since the operator responsible for the anonymous remailer would have access to the return path of the response, reliance on the integrity of that operator is required. Clearly, this substantially reduces the level of *security* of this communication scheme.
Therefore, it would be desirable to create an electronic system and a corresponding method for maintaining anonymous and traffic analysis resistant communications over a communication link without dependence on the integrity of the system operator.

Larry is not alone in seeing the lucrative benefits of defending the giant law enforcement and national security industries, why you can read the turncoats all around the world of digital opportunity going on about the need for vigilance on the dangerous Net and worse, advocating prowling Intel-inside private computers networks to spot looming threats.

It's common for those accomplished in one field to believe that ability is confidently transferrable to another, in particular for social, political and religious matters -- and vice versa.
Endeavors which require close, sustained concentration and logical methodologies seldom help with challenges which require noodling, free-form creativity, openness to disagreement, compromise. And vice versa.
Disaster looms when a logical minded person gains political power and sets out to arrange a nation into a perfect society as if a machine for sharply controlled output. And vice versa when a muddled-headed dreamer sets out to design and manufacture physical structures.
Yet again and again this happens: logical nuts get into positions of political power -- left, right and center, anarcho and theological -- and all to often millions suffer, and multi-thousands are murdered. Or an all-loving putz so narcotizes adherents to believe heaven on earth is at hand that mass suicide occurs, not least by letting a logical nut annihilate the willing victims.
Cluelessness abounds, not only on cpunks but in all fields, almost as commonplace as clueless flaming. Flaming the clueless is perfect proof that flamers are no wiser than those they mimic.
Never let an over-confident thinker run anything except bath water and never obey a beloved mush-brain calling for war. Yet here we are, flaming the clueless at hand as if whistling is courageous deep-thinking.

It also expands the authorizations according to which travelers departing the United States may take encryption for their personal use, and clarifies that specially designed medical equipment and software are not controlled as encryption or ``information security'' items under the EAR. Finally this rule implements changes to the Wassenaar Arrangement List of dual-use items (agreed upon in the September 2002 meeting and finalized in December 2002) that eliminate from Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 5A002 certain types of ``Personalized smart cards'' and equipment specially designed and limited to controlling access to copyright protected data.

Patent Abstract
The Spread Spectrum Image Steganography (SSIS) of the present invention is a data hiding/secret communication steganographic system which uses digital imagery as a cover signal. SSIS provides the ability to hide a significant quantity of information bits within digital images while avoiding detection by an observer. The message is recovered with low error probability due the use of error control coding. SSIS payload is, at a minimum, an order of magnitude greater than of existing watermarking methods. Furthermore, the original image is not needed to extract the hidden information. The proposed recipient need only possess a key in order to reveal the secret message. The very existence of the hidden information is virtually undetectable by human or computer analysis. Finally, SSIS provides resiliency to transmission noise, like that found in a wireless environment and low levels of compression.

Sherman Austin was arrested in New York but not charged and held in
prison there to await an indictment in California. New York said it
had no legitimate charges to make against him and merely did
a favor for California to nab Sherman during a street demonstration --
the only arrest of the day. Grounds for arrest were faults in Sherman's
jalopy he'd driven to NY for the demo.
Ordered transferred to California while an attorney tried to
arrange his release to a family member, he was shuttled around federal prisons for more days, his family and attorney not sure where he was. He was finally released when  a judge determined he was being unfairly punished by prison procedure. He was released at the Oklahoma City federal transfer
station, to find his way home on his own, the family had not
been told he was being released.
Not long after his return to California, the prosecutor announced there would be no prosecution. (During this time some of us mirrored the bomb making material
Sherman had on his RaisetheFist.com site -- the forbidden material is still up, see below.)
After some weeks the prosecutor reinstated the indictment and
initiated plea negotiations. Sherman rejected the initial comparatively
mild plea offer.
More time passed with not much happening. Then the feds went
on the attack again and issued harsher plea demands and threats.
This new attack led Sherman's attorney to recommend a bargain.
Sherman considered fighting but he was advised what he legal
fee would be and the maximum penalty if he lost. He agreed to
a four month sentence. The judge upped that to a year.
Sherman was eighteen when this shit began.

The alarm and security specialists we've talked to claim the
greatest threat to systems are authorized users: the property
owners, their children, employees, servants, nearly all of whom
fail to arm and disarm the system properly not matter how
carefully instructed. A false alarm is feared by these users more than an attacker, for they are more often traumatized by an errant signal, and the outpouring of security personnel and police, than by an actual attacker. (Like the US security and law enforcement systems.)
The security responders are so pissed, or so condescending, that the users are in a state of panic about the systems going off falsely. Answer to that is to leave the system off. And claim they forgot to arm it. Thus, self-censorship to keep the cops
from attacking.
Then there are panic room backups which freak the users due
to its capability of killing them with false threats like the gentleman, Safra, was killed on the Mediterranean coast when he believed
he was under attack as responders tried to rescue him. Responders
are a genuine threat when they think you are an AIDS carrier.
It's worth keeping in mind, that protective and security systems
can do you great harm, like friendly fire and security agencies of
all kinds -- banks, doctors, accountants, in-house guards, most
trusted associates.
Gun owners, and nations, being killed by their own weapons is a kissing cousin threat. Technology is a gun most often in the hands
of those will to fire first then question who's there.
WMDs are the biggest threat to the US and ilk, those owned by
the panic-room trapped users. North Korea, say, or the Joint
Chiefs, aided and abetted by the low-credibility spooks.
Back to failure of home security systems: its the back-up batteries that don't get replaced, rather the monthly bill for
service is neglected by wayward servants while the owner is vacationing on a yacht being tracked by IRS.

"Instant Ciphertext-Only Cryptanalysis of GSM Encrypted
Communications," by Elad Barkan, Eli Biham, Nathan Keller
    (18 Pages, 234KB)
Abstract. In this paper we present a very practical cipher-text only
cryptanalysis of GSM encrypted communications, and various active
attacks on the GSM protocols. These attacks can even break into
GSM networks that use "unbreakable" ciphers. We describe a
ciphertext-only attack on A5/2 that requires a few dozen milliseconds
of encrypted off-the-air cellular conversation and finds the correct
key in less than a second on a personal computer. We then extend
this attack to a (more complex) ciphertext-only attack on A5/1. We
describe new attacks on the protocols of networks that use A5/1, A5/3,
or even GPRS. These attacks are based on security flaws of the GSM
protocols, and work whenever the mobile phone supports A5/2. We
emphasize that these attacks are on the protocols, and are thus
applicable whenever the cellular phone supports a weak cipher, for
instance they are also applicable using the cryptanalysis of A5/1.
Unlike previous attacks on GSM that require unrealistic information,
like long known plaintext periods, our attacks are very practical and
do not require any knowledge of the content of the conversation.
These attacks allow attackers to tap conversations and decrypt
them either in real-time, or at any later time. We also show active
attacks, such as call hijacking, altering data messages and call

Fri Oct 10,10:48 AM ET
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The State Department has protested to televangelist Pat Robertson about his "despicable" suggestion that someone blow up the department with a nuclear bomb, an official said on Thursday.   Robertson, a former presidential candidate, made the remark in an interview with Joel Mowbray, author of a new book entitled "Dangerous Diplomacy: How the State Department Endangers America's Security." State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, asked to comment, said on Thursday: "I lack sufficient capabilities to express my disdain.
 ... I think the very idea is despicable." The department has made its views clear to Robertson, added a State Department official, who asked not to be named. Introducing Mowbray on his Christian Broadcasting Network, Robertson said that a person who read Mowbray's book would reach the conclusion that a nuclear explosion at the State Department was the best solution. "I read your book. When you get through, you say (to yourself): 'If I could just get a nuclear device inside Foggy Bottom (the State Department's main building), I think that's the answer' and you say: 'We've got to blow that thing up.' I mean, is it as bad as you say?" he said. "It is," Mowbray replied. Mowbray himself did not make the suggestion, either in his book or in the interview. According to the network's Web site, Mowbray's book "exposes the mixed allegiances, hidden agendas, and outright anti-Americanism found in the State Department."

I was expecting someone else at about the same time. True, I could
have refused entry after the agent showed his ID. However, it
seemed too good an opportunity to pass up: it is pretty common
for Cryptome to get unexpected contributions. We try to remain
open lines of communication to unknown sources, if not a goodly
amount of info would never come out way.
For all I knew, and now know, the Special Agents were frauds,
of which Cryptome gets a taste regularly, perhaps more than
we know. As discussed here, spoofing is trivial to do.
Toward the end of the visit I asked SA Kelly to see his ID up close
and he displayed a wallet with a brass badge on the left and a
two-leaf ID on the right: flip left, then flip up. Was it real?
The two-leaf ID looked like the version SA Renner showed at
the door.
Trim haircuts and dark suits, healthy-looking young Caucasians,
no facial hair, shined shoes, clean teeth, no noticeable mouth or body odor, no obvious weapon bulges, polite, actually not
polite all the time: there were a few instances when mild
friction occurred, low-key warnings sent my way about
inadvertent threats to the nation with too much information
like that on Cryptome.
SA Renner was cooler than Kelly during questioning -- Kelly slightly bristled when I made a comment about free flowing information making the US stronger, the agent saying, yes, but information can be misused. He bristled a lot more when
I said I would publish their names, "make them famous." At
the word "famous" Kelly said, smiling "really, I haven't had that before."
Renner was quieter on naming names, knowing that there
was a CNN story out about him. But he too mildly protested
with the "hazard to the family" shtick.
Kelly said, "you know we can be found by knowing our
names, get shot for what we do." That reminded me of
Jeff Gordon, but I didn't snort.
Kelly leaned forward in his wing-back chair, slightly aggressive, whereas Renner sat upright at a table, case file in front, posing most of the questions to me.
Now, if I had refused the agents entry could I be telling this
dinky inside story? Perhaps better will be the second visit, or door-busting and marching downstairs in handcuffs, or dark-van-snatch on the street, or my family and customers
and friends questioned and warned, my assets seized
and listed in the New York Times, gosh, what notoriety
being a questionable patriot can lead to -- maybe right
up there at the foot soles of the Special Agents, real or Confirming the allegation about idiot witnesses, I am
sure I would not recognize either agent if I saw them

SA Renner did most of the talking and carried a
manila folder with a file name on it beginning with
"SP,"  I think. Couldn't see the remainder. He didn't open it during the session and it may have been
a prop.
They showed up without warning, no call ahead, got
past our Doberman doorman (we're on the 6th floor)
who usually calls us about visitors but didn't this time, and hasn't said a peep since the visit.
(In contrast, when I got subpoenas for the Bell grand jury and trial, the doorman called up about the Treasury agents and I met them in the street level lobby.)
Renner showed ID, asked to come in and talk. They
were here about half an hour.
I tried to get them to sit together but they carefully
bracketed me.
They asked who works with me on Cryptome, who
funds it. Me and me alone, I said.
The FBI agents asked about nobody except me. Renner
asked for ID and I showed him Duncan's, or maybe it was I sent an account to cpunks right after the visit but LNE
never processed it, nor three more later. Hence this
algebra late comer.

@_subject: FOIA Data Mining 
We've made a few FOIA requests, but none have produced a
flood of paper like that made to the US Army INSCOM for a list
of military intelligence files provided by anonymous, most dating from the 1940s and 1950s but some up to the 70s and 80s.
An aspect of the response has been INSCOM forwarding our request to a host of other agencies which originated certain files: State, Justice, FBI, CIA, other Army sections, Air Force,
Navy, and so on. These have been dribbling in, nearly all
heavily redacted or flat out refused.
A characteristic of the responses has been the labels on
the envelopes: nearly all typed and thereby capable of being
added to, or already entered into, a database on me and
Cryptome. One exception: the FBI, which hand writes the address. Is this due to crappy label printing capability (which we all share) or an attempt to obscure that the address has been, or could
be, put in a data base? Transmittal letters are typed so that means the data has been digitized (or typewriter written), so why else the hand writing? Has the Bureau been sued for digital labelling correspondents?
Do printed labels tell too much about the agency, source of toner,
supplier of fonts and word-processing programs, paper manufacturer,
tiny flecks of skin and/or fingerprints on the label adhesive? Does
hand writing analysis show the origin of the ink, the birthplace and
ethnicity of the writer, her/his state of mind -- on the verge of a
nervous breakdown, ready to kill or leak or go over to the enemy,
sexually drained by bosses horniness, a skinny dreaming of Twinkies -- thus does the laboratory investigate FOIA requests
sent to the FBI directly and more importantly those forwarded
by other the enemy: other agencies spilling the beans about
vast data gathering.
Redactions are an art form, there have been several NYC exhibits
of redacted FBI files, and more coming from their twisted sisters.
The great barrels of ink used to make redactions contains volumes of raw data which will be revealed when the ink disappears.

@_subject: An Analysis of Compromised Remailers 
This came in response to Cryptome's posting of Len Sassman's
comments on remailers.
Thank you for posting the "Compromised Remailers" article:
Over the past year, many remailer users have noticed that the reliability of the Mixmaster type II network has steadily degraded. Although it may well be the result of TLA interference, the remailer community's statistical methods of selecting a "reliable" remailer chain contribute significantly to the network's degradation.
As a former employee of the United States Army Communications Command [USACC] Headquarters, I was amazed to stumble upon the existence of a publicly available communications medium permitting truly anonymous communication by hampering the government's ability at "traffic analysis," or tracking an email message from its source to its destination. One would have to be foolish to believe that TLAs are not hard at work trying to pierce the veil of anonymity afforded by the Mixmaster type II, and, the yet to be released, type III remailers.
I ran tests in September, October & November, and provided the Mixmaster developers & remail operators with the same results I've included below. My testing was extremely simple: send a bunch of messages, and note which messages arrived. [The same procedure an accountant would use in tracking a financial transaction from its origin to its destination.]
What I found was that a handful of remailers accounted for virtually all of the un-delivered email messages. Yet, these same remailers, that never delivered my email messages to the "alt.anonymous.messages" news group, where also listed as among the most reliable remailers in mixmaster stats used to select remailer chains.
I've included my recommendations to improve the network's reliability in the test results below.

This came in response to Cryptome's posting of Len Sassman's
comments on remailers.
Thank you for posting the "Compromised Remailers" article:
Over the past year, many remailer users have noticed that the reliability of the Mixmaster type II network has steadily degraded. Although it may well be the result of TLA interference, the remailer community's statistical methods of selecting a "reliable" remailer chain contribute significantly to the network's degradation.
As a former employee of the United States Army Communications Command [USACC] Headquarters, I was amazed to stumble upon the existence of a publicly available communications medium permitting truly anonymous communication by hampering the government's ability at "traffic analysis," or tracking an email message from its source to its destination. One would have to be foolish to believe that TLAs are not hard at work trying to pierce the veil of anonymity afforded by the Mixmaster type II, and, the yet to be released, type III remailers.
I ran tests in September, October & November, and provided the Mixmaster developers & remail operators with the same results I've included below. My testing was extremely simple: send a bunch of messages, and note which messages arrived. [The same procedure an accountant would use in tracking a financial transaction from its origin to its destination.]
What I found was that a handful of remailers accounted for virtually all of the un-delivered email messages. Yet, these same remailers, that never delivered my email messages to the "alt.anonymous.messages" news group, where also listed as among the most reliable remailers in mixmaster stats used to select remailer chains.
I've included my recommendations to improve the network's reliability in the test results below.

Despite the long-lived argument that public review of crypto assures
its reliability, no national infosec agency -- in any country worldwide --
follows that practice for the most secure systems. NSA's support for AES notwithstanding, the agency does not disclose its military and
high level systems.
It is likely that these agencies are willing to go along with the notion
of public review to lull users into depending on the systems made
public. If any are breakable, the review will show that, and if the
agencies can break them they need not say squat, merely reap
the benefits of public ignorance and trust in seemingly unbreakable systems, as with Enigma, Crypto AG, and numerous other historical examples David Kahn describes.
Cryptome's FOI request for NSA documents on when and what it learned about public key (non-secret) crypto from the Brits is now 3 1/2 years old. The agency has said it has relevants documents but has not yet released anything, though some $4,000 has been paid for the search. (Last response from NSA: May 23, 2003, a telephone
call from Pamela Philips, FOIA Chief, saying that the request was in the "easy queue," number 45 from the top.)
Whit Diffie has said he got hints of PK, or something like it, at
NSA. It is not clear from his account whether information on
PK was deliberately leaked to him, with or without a restriction
of disclosure, or if the breakthrough was truly a phenomenal private effort of Diffie-Hellman-Merkle.
Consider that intelligence agencies are known to run years-
even decades-long deception operations, especially about
top secret infosec operations, with the goal of deceiving about the strength of infosec systems so that they will be sufficiently
trusted to be widely used. Again, Kahn cites numerous examples of such deceptions.
The reputation of witting and unwitting participants and institutions
are often used to gain trust in these breakable systems. The
weakness of vaunted systems is considered to be more valuable
than their strengths.
It is imaginable that if AES did not exist it would have to be invented
for such a purposed. As with PK, PGP and the notion that public review of crypto is the hen's teeth of assurance.
Until national infosec agencies reveal what they know it does not
seem prudent to to believe conventional wisdom no matter
how often repeated, especially how often repeated. A 100% safe crypto system is never to be believed, isn't that what always accompanies cryptographers' assurances for they
now better than anyone that snake oil is their No. 1 tool.
Snake oil = crypto, which accounts for why the charge is so often hurled. And why snake oil is used to camouflage what is occurring
beneath its contemptible obviousness.

Encryption is used by the FBI to flag and snag messages. Whether the

NSA reportedly archives indefinitely all encrypted communications,
breakable or not. Who is encrypting to who IDs targets better
than the messages which can be grabbed before and after
decryting if needs be.
So hiding encryption is as important, if not moreso, as its use. USPTO has an NSA patent on extracting text from images, and probably an unpublicized capability to spot crypto among many media and transport
mechanisms, thus encryption stego should go well underground or dispersed among static. Shave your packet, inscribe the message,

A powerful method for extracting information from supposedly secure systems is side-channel attacks, i.e., cryptanalytic techniques that rely on information unintentionally leaked by computing devices. Most attention has been focused on electromagnetic emanations, power consumption and, recently, diffuse visible light from CRT displays. The oldest eavesdropping channel, namely acoustic emanations, has received little attention. The following demonstrates some preliminary results in the analysis of acoustic emanations from personal computers, showing them to be a surprisingly rich source of information on CPU activity.

Special emphasis is given to detecting and countering espionage and other threats and activities directed by foreign intelligence services against the United States Government, United States corporations, establishments, and citizens.
The list includes technical discussion regarding the design and construction of SCIF facilities, Black Chambers, and Screen Rooms. This list is also for discussing DIAM 50-3, NSA-65, and DCID 1/21, 1/22 compliance.
The primary goal and mission of this list is to "raise the bar" and increase the level of professionalism present within the TSCM business.

telephone, radio, and lately the narcoticly privacy-invading

Spies always deny their best spying techniques, and ridicule the alleged means, most often by boosting the well-known tricks,
indeed hiding behind the tried and true by pretending outrage
at leaks about means and methods, or by novelizing the legacy
practices to camouflage what is actually going on.
Tempest has got a lot of public coverage in recent years though benefits and hazards of compromising emanations has been around for a least a century, though nearly always kept
classified. It is to be wondered what capabilities are being
cloaked by the increasing public knowledge and emphasis
on tempest protection in unclassified military comsec guides.
As often stated here, planning for comsec should correlate
with the threat level: personal, business, political, military.
Personal life and death threat often gets overridden by
national security threat, so individuals and famililies and
interest groups may be sacrificed to protect a nation --
or so it is argued by the LE and natsec addicts (who themselves
really get pissed when you do to them what they do to others).
Setting up, inventing, or deploying means to protect yourself against a national level threat, rather than an overlookable
personal or business threat, would be a good way to
get the LE and natsec addicits on your case. So keep it
quiet -- unless you're looking for bountiful contracts with

a friendly visit by guys in suits, babes in edible clothing, an online admirer of your daring technical prowess, or a UAV depending on how reachable you are.
Spies are claimed to applaud their luck when they get

the other two usual Muslim suspects. The daily transcripts:
A lot of the early proceeding is dry legal maneurvering so you got to dig
for the technical testimony.
One defendant had 85,000 interceptions over several years, and
as intercept systems changed from analogue (Lockheed Martin) to digital (Raytheon) the conversion and archiving process lost a crucial portion of the intercepts, a basis of charges. Defense lawyers are hammering the FBI witnesses on how this could have occurred, and in the process eliciting a good bit of interesting info on the means and methods, as well as the reputation and ability of the witnesses and the Lockheed and Raytheon interception, manipulation
and archiving systems.
Testimony shows that the FBI continues to rely upon service providers
and contractors for the technical intercepts and freely admit that
the bureau could not do it otherwise. What is done with the raw
intercepts afterwards by the FBI collection, analysis and technical
staff in the field and at the Quantico Engineering Research Facility,
meticulously directed by US Attorneys to pick and choose among the data to support the charges, is what the defense is challenging.
At some point the contractors will be called to describe what takes place beyond FBI capability. The prosecution appears not to want

witnesses to set the limits of jury and the public exposure to the possibilities of counter-interception.

Not yet aware the NY-bound wetback had been nabbed we posted material and photos on July 29 about how Amtrak and Long Island Railroad Manhattan tunnels provide easy access to Madison Square Garden located above subterranean Penn Station and the nearby post office where the thousands of press are to be isolated from protestors:
We noted that the tunnels are known to be highly hazardous due to
lack of fire protection and emergency exits.
Shortly a flood of hits started coming from federal, NY state and NYC
security IPs -- Treasury, Homeland Security, DOT, GSA; Kallstrom's
NYS Office of Public Security and a host of Albany agencies; NYPD,
FDNY, the Transit Agency; Suffolk County adjoining NYC; various
from New Jersey; and a slew of other locations. While some were
familiar, a lot of these had not come around before.
None telephoned or visited, maybe during the work week when the
round-up begins as a result of squeezing the intruder.
Presumably red-team postings -- call them chatter, or better: the naming of specific targets -- get fired off to tight-fisted financing agencies to cut loose some emergency bucks, in the Bush re-election manner.
Many more to come before November. Perhaps some real, more
more likely fabbed from odds and ends sucked from the ether
of hard-up operatives -- NYPD Intelligence Commish is ex-CIA.

Excerpt below from a Baltimore Sun article of August 8, 2004.
Some of it could be true, but.
Director of NSA shifts to new path
By Scott Shane
Sun National Staff
August 8, 2004  Technology revolution   Given the dire assessments a few years ago, it is notable that Hayden says the communications revolution has on the whole been a plus, not a minus, for the NSA.   The NSA director declines to elaborate. But interviews with outside experts suggest that the agency has managed to overcome the challenges posed by fiber-optic cable and encryption.   "My opinion is that at this point, those are little more than a speed bump to NSA," says Steve Uhrig, president of SWS Security, a Harford County firm that builds eavesdropping and counter-eavesdropping systems for U.S. and foreign police agencies. "They have a virtually unlimited budget, and they can put amazing resources to work on a problem."   Several sources who regularly speak with NSA officials say they believe Uhrig is right. Although they do not know the details, they say the agency has almost certainly managed to tap fiber cables on a large-scale basis, making access to the information inside less of a problem than its overwhelming volume.   The NSA has also found a silver lining to the use of encrypted e-mail: Even if a particular message cannot be read, the very use of encryption can flag it for NSA's attention. By tracking the relatively few Internet users in a certain country or region who take such security measures, NSA analysts might be able to sketch a picture of a terrorist network.   Information 'in motion'   And by focusing their electronic tricks on messages as they are first typed on a computer or when they are read on the other end - what security experts call "information at rest" - NSA technical experts might be able to bypass otherwise-unbreakable encryption used when the information is "in motion."   Meanwhile, the popularity of e-mail and particularly of cell phones has worked to the NSA's advantage in the battle against terrorism.   The NSA's computers can track and sort huge volumes of e-mail far more easily than they can manage telephone intercepts, because text is consistently represented in digital code.   And cell phones - as handy for terrorist plotters as for everyone else - provide not just an eavesdropping target but also a way to physically track the user.   Uhrig, who has installed cellular intercept systems in several countries, says that as cell phones have proliferated, the "cells" served by a tower or other antenna have correspondingly grown smaller. "A big hotel may have a cell for every other floor. Every big office building is its own cell," he says.   Easier tracking   By following a switched-on cell phone as it shifts from cell to cell, "you can watch the person move," Uhrig says. "You can tell the direction he's moving. If he's moving slow, he's walking. If he's moving fast, he's in a car. The tracking is sometimes of much more interest than the contents of a call."

The FBI visit took place in November 2003. Here's an account:
The John Stewart piece excerpted an AP-TV clip taped on August 16 which was a supplement to an AP story about FBI
harassment of potential RNC protestors. AP, like ABC News, confused the unrelated November visit with the August RNC visits. What got their attention
were Cryptome's aerials and maps -- red-team exposure
of vulnerabilities around Madison Square Garden, and
our accusation of NYC security by obscurity. No feds or LEs have inquired about those obvious weaknesses.
During interviews we've tried to explain this but that
didn't mean shit to the interviewers who were looking for people to brand anarchists who had been smeared by FBI
visits. Why are you helping terrorists, they chant.
We had no contact with the Daily Show. And didn't use
the term anarchist in interviews although several interviewers
urged it.
We told one interviewer that anarchism was too mild for
our intention to undermine civilization, to rid the earth of
humanity, for the planet to shrivel into nothingness, to
accept that the desire to be god was a useless passion. Oh shit, he said, you're a Sartrean.

That was a surprise and I missed it. Saw the re-run just
now. Pretty funny, ISTM.
The clip was from an AP TV piece which was taped
just before the recent AP story. One day a still photographer
and video guy came to do a follow-up to a telephone interview
by Tom Hays, the AP reporter. No fanfare like the ABC
News gang. The two were in and out in 20 minutes. Each
carried his own equipment, the TV guy packing a heavy
shoulder camera. No lighting, no rigging, a mic, a recorder,
the camera.
He asked a couple of questions, said just talk, so I did.
He said turn off the radio. Shot the barking carcass. He said
walk down the corridor, don't talk. He shot a couple of scrolling screens, packed up, took off.
The still camera guy was the only journalist over recent
days who showed press ID, wore it around his neck. He was a black man, so it figures. He said, without prompting,
you know it's amazing how people let the press into
their homes and offices, no questions asked. We could
be cops or feds and nobody'd know. He said a couple of
guys showed up at his home while the baby-sitter and
his daughter were alone, had talked their way past the
doorman, said they were cops, but showed no ID. The
baby-sitter said show me ID. The guys said we don't
need to. The babysitter said go to hell and slammed the door. The next day, the photog called the precinct
to see if its cops had come. Precinct said nobody from
here went there, but maybe they were from another
jurisdiction. He said he never learned who they were
or why they came.
A black women reporter came a couple of days ago,
showed no ID but mesmerizing giant hooters in a deep-cut blouse. Don't remember what I told her, her name or
who she worked for. Fought hard to look at her eyes,
I think.

There were several USG offices in the Twin Towers, some of
them intelligence. In addition, CIA was located in 7 WTC, along with Secret Service and military offices. The military offices
were used as cover for the others. There was far more USG in WTC than in Murrah, and the lesson learned in OKC was no doubt useful to the attackers: collateral hurt to innocents is magnitudes
more powerful than hitting military targets -- that is what
strategic bombing was invented to demonstrate, not to say threatening with WMDs, a practice invented by the US and
which remains its primary defense strategy.
The cause and effect between USG WMD threats and terrorist attacks is yet to be fully admitted outside military circles: the
military accepts that innocents will be slaughtered, and the
winner must slaughter the most. Terrorism to the military is a nuisance even when a few of its troops are picked off.
The losses in Iraq do not even make a blip on expected
casualties of a major war. More military have died in
conventional accidents, murders and suicides around the world than have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. But those in the Middle East have greater utility for the military to boost its suck for more funds and more "our boys and girls"
sacrifice and more bawling in congress and the presidential campaign about protecting the nation, defense cut-back not
even a dream since ever so convienent 9/11.
Murrah bombing helped the battle against homeland militants,
and WTC got the ball rolling for battle overseas.

I appreciate your valiant if futile effort to defend honorable
militarism, but you appear not to understand that much of current US military doctrine is aimed at terrorizing enemy forces, en masse, into submission, not merely courageously killing each combatant, mano a mano.
Carpet bombing, bunker-busting, cruise missles, stealth
attacks, artillery barrages, and tactical and strategic attacks
with overwhelming forces in multiples of the opposing force, the so-called "shock and awe," are intended to demoralize and terrify the opposition including civilian supporters. These
attacks require little or no courage to execute, for most are
accomplished with stand-off or remote-controlled platforms,
guided by long-radar, GPS, and satellites, systems operated
by clean-uniformed technicians who don't bear personal
arms, even take showers daily and watch TV of their
carnage for entertainment.
This contrasts with the special forces which do aim at
small scale, precision killing, and which does require courage.
Not much of that goes on, way too cheap for the military-
industrial empire which treasures big iron, gigantic iron,
humongous iron, unbelievably expensive metal, costing
millions of dollars per kill, rather imaginary deaths in the
Cold War manner.
Don't mistake the language and literature of war for

blast, and your organs go into shutdown from the
concussion, yours vision blurs, your limbs won't

your skin will sizzle, boiling blood will spray out

There is a decreasing chance the US can apply its military
might to defeat an unconventional enemy. That kind of enemy
is not what long-standing military strategy and most tactics
are aimed at. Rumsfeld was hoping to revise that when yet
one more mighty military war appeared to head off changing
military policy.
The US has demonstrated in Afghanistan and post-Hussein
Iraq that it does not know how to fight unconventionally. That
inability appeared in Korea, then Viet Nam and has been shown
in every combat the US has engaged in since WW 2.
Military professionals know this and are hamstrung by the
narcotic dependency the defense industry and its beneficiaries
has for big iron and every bigger and more expensive platforms.
This has been coupled with gigantism in intelligence, big science
and big technological research advocated and overseen by giant
corporations and institutions. And to gloss this a huge spin
and propoganda machine has been funded to pump up the
threats and the hefty defense tax boondogling.
Special forces and operations were devised to piss-ant an alternative to this spread across the US pork-barrell behemothicism. But they have seldom been applied beyond pinprick displays, with much hoorahing about their stealthy effectiveness: "we can tell you about our successes, only failures make it to the media."
Commentators have noted the corrupting influence of empire
Britain thinking its global navy would assure continuance of
hegemony. The more that conceit was believed the weaker
the military became by its failure to recognize new forms of
warfare and new ways of thinking. That empire was undermined
by non-hegemonic forms of combat and thinking.
The US might get a bye with its arrogant belief in military might

The US has not won since WW2. Rebellions, now called
terrorist wars, have been far more successful. If you want
to be a winner do not enlist in military forces of states, rather
get a spin contract far from danger, arguing the virtues of
mightily fearsome hardware and sacrificial patriotism.
The US, a hidebound state, engages in limited combat, dithers, gets youngsters killed, parades the funerals and heroes, eventually pulls out, and the apologists for warmongering do their dirty. Still, it can be said of US military might: more servicemen die of military and civilian accidents, ill health, murders and
suicide than in combat. Worse, deaths and maimings from friendly fire and bad medical care, not to say military justice,
remain a high hazard of high technology and a natsec/military
policy of acceptance and/or denial of responsibility for self-
caused casualties and homicidal behavior in abused and
abandoned service members -- Tim McVeigh one of tens

On CJ (Carl Johnson) and Jim Bell:
There was a time when the greatest terrorist threat to the
US was located in the northwestern part of the country,
Idaho, Washington State and Oregon, some of California.
Militia the infidels were called.
The US Attorney's Office in Tacoma, WA, was a center
of counterterrorist activity, aided by FBI, Treasury, IRS,
US Marshals, DEA and others.
Jim Bell was twice busted, tried, convicted and jailed, by the
Tacoma USA, for alleged acts against the USG, primarily the IRS, but knowledgeable citizens presume the assault was the result of his essay, Assassination Politics (AP), which descibed a system for anonymous killing of varmints, government officials especially, but not limited to those.
CJ defended Jim with a series of online statements on his
behalf, and for allegedly running an online version of AP.
For this misbehavior he was busted, tried, convicted and jailed,
also by the Tacoma USA.
Jim served his first term, allegedly misbehaved again,
and was sent to jail again, where he remains and continues
to file appeals of his railroading. CJ served a term and is now free, pursuing among other wonders his career as
the King of Country Porn.
Bell and CJ posted regularly to cypherpunks during their
days of pre-jailing, and some of their messages here were
used against them during trial. An agent of the IRS, Jeff
Gordon was a known subscriber of cypherpunks for
the purpose of surveilling members and stashing useful
email evidence to advance his career -- Jeff was indeed awarded honors for his investigation and jailing of the heroes of the revolution. Here's a US Marshal report on Jeff's snooping:
   On November 25, 1997, Inspector Jeff GORDAN with the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) Portland, Oregon, contacted the U.S.
Marshals Service, Tacoma, Washington, regarding an internet
posting he had obtained on this day (see attached).
   On the same date, Deputy U.S. Marshal STEPHENSON contacted
Inspector GORDAN in an attempt obtain further details regarding
the individuals mentioned in the internet posting. Inspector
GORDAN related the following:
   On May 17, 1997, the IRS in Vancouver, Washington, arrested
James Dalton BELL ( for threats, assaults,
obstruction, and intimidation of employees and officers of the
IRS. During IRS's initial investigation of BELL, the IRS
discovered that BELL was associated with the Multnomah County
Common Law Court as well as the author of "Assassination
Politics", an essay that describes and advocates the development
and use of a system to reward people who kill selected Government
employees. BELL was also known to transmit his beliefs via
internet services (see W/WA case    Inspector GORDON indicated that since BELL's arrest his office
has been monitoring internet postings by the Cypherpunks, one of
the groups BELL was known to be communicating with. Many of the
postings are simply communications between members of the group
regarding their dissatisfaction with the Government. Inspector
GORDAN related that this posting was a concern due to the
statement made by the author, indicating that Tim MAY announced
he would be murdering Jim Bell's judge (known to be U.S. District
Judge Franklin BURGESS or Magistrate J. Kelly ARNOLD) on Friday,
at 4;00 p.m.
   Inspector GORDAN indicated that he is not familiar with the
author of the posting, Bad BobbyH, however he was familiar with
Tim MAY. Inspector GORDAN described MAY as being an
anarchist/survivalist who seems to spend much of his time
communicating his beliefs via the internet. According to
Inspector GORDAN, MAY is retired and fairly "well off", making
his fortune years ago by developing computer programs. May also
has a tendency to attempt to "goat" or "bait" law enforcement
officers into taking action and has repeatedly stated he would
shoot any law enforcement officers who attempted to arrest him.
   Inspector GORDAN provided the following information regarding
the individuals mentioned in the posting:
   Timothy C. MAY (DoB: 12/21/51 & SSN: XXX-XX-XXX)
   XXX
   Corralltos, CA 95078
   Robert HETTINGA
   XXX
   Boston, MA 02131
   Inspector GORDAN disclosed that his office is unable to trace
the posting because the address, Robert Heidegger (rh
is false/untraceable.
   On November 25, 1997, U.S. District Judge Franklin BURGESS and
Magistrate Judge J. Kelly ARNOLD were notified by Supervisory
Deputy Glenn WHALEY and Deputy STEPHENSON reference the internet
   A copy of the internet posting was forwarded to FBI Special
Agent Ron Stankye (360) 695-5661.

who swab your puke and dump your garbage and bail you out of

Contamination by settlement of North America (and man-woman

That's how you succeed in the New Worlds, behave like Calvinist cum Libertarian cum Roman cum Roman Church pretend aristocrats: if you dont'have it you don't deserve it, but you can always steal
it the legal way, stock market and tithe basket, praise Allah for his valorizing wealth as salvation.
But, more of the defense budget goes for clean-up of its messes in
the US than for military health-care and benefits (overseas it has
hardly begun). The clean-up corporations are mostly the same ones which made the messes (this is the pattern since the Revolutionary
War), and they are not doing the job worth a shit, overruns and performance failures as bad as for unworkable but richly bragged-about armaments. If the bitching about contamination gets too loud, why
start another war.
The DC-area is one of the most contaminated parts of the US due to the plethora of toxic-puking mil installations. One of the worst is under American University and surrounding neighborhoods, across Nebraska Avenue from the headquarters of Homeland Security, itself once home of the military's oldest comsec unit.
As sleazy Hitchens and slews of other suck-ups of the rich and powerful have demonstrated, especially those predating from Canada: defend and flatter and amuse the privileged of the US-supremacist model of the New World as if the Old in new clothing, and you'll do quite well.

The Selective Service website unctuously declares there is
no draft foreseen at the moment and lists defeat of recent congressional efforts to institute the draft. However, it
emphasizes that the agency is required by law to remain
at the ready to immediately institute a draft upon notice.
As part of this responsibility It polls educational instutitions every 18 months requesting updated information on draft-age youngsters who are receiving federal funding, the most
recent of these polls here:
A single harsh attack on US interests could precipitate a draft,
and override public opposition in a flash.
The military has nearly exhausted it National Guard and Reserve
options, and will not give up the long-standing strategic policy
of being able to fight two major wars at once. Thus most military
resources are tied up not in the Middle East but in pre-positioned
locations determined by the 2-wars policy.
Whether the US military should forego its 2-war policy and
use its forces in ways more appropriate to current threats
will be determined by those interest groups who benefit from
the horrifically expensive and magnificently wasteful 2-war Two generations of military personnel have been trained for
the 2-war threat, and almost none have faced actual combat.
This inexperience shows in unconventional warfare. again
and again. Big war planners throw big war resources are
small targets, take the applause for the phony war show,
as in Fallujah, and discount lives lost because the do not
show up on big war statistical-casualties diagrams.
Big wars expect big losses, far more than volunteers can
provide. Indeed, volunteer military personnel -- officers and
enlisted -- are careful to throw conscripts into the breech
as if they are expendable ammunition, the more thrown
the higher the credit obtained in charts of capacity, not
charts of smarts.
Recall Kennedy embraced the counter-insurgent tool with
support for Special Forces, but these forces remain a
marginal part of the military, not least because they do not
require much material and political resouces to do their
duty. Big defense, and never forget, big intelligence to
feed the need for big defense,  are far superior ar generating
contracts, jobs, careers and campaign contributions.
The US is totally addicted to profligate, wasteful ineffective
big war policy, primarily because there is little risk in
parading might, bragging about it, threatening with it, compared to using it. Every application of US military might since WW2 has failed.
STF up and pay your taxes, asshole, encourage your sons

Chapter 15 A Law Aimed at Yardley, pp. 158-72:
The law:
An Act For the Protection of Government records
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
whoever, by virtue of his employment by the United States, shall
obtain from another or shall have custody of or acess to, or shall
have had custody of or access to, any official diplomatic code or any

prepared in any such code, and shall willfully, without authorization
or competent authority, publish or furnish to another any such
code or matter, or any matter which was obtained while in the
process of transmission between any foreign government and

Thanks for the comments here. Two responses received from No. 1
Comments concerning TEMPEST and Laser Mic probes of windows and fenestration.
1. A high security internal and external window install would typically consist of two layers of 0.75 inch glass with a high lead contact. Exterior facing walls may have ballistic glass of varying thickness, again with a high lead layer.
2. Music IS NOT introduced between layers in a high security application. However, WHITE NOISE is introduced; sourced from a very secure high entropy white noise generator whose output is constantly monitored and mathmatically analysed in order to detect any unacceptable departure from the expected levels of entropy.
No. 2
US patent 6,285,773 discloses a speaker designed specifically for use in double glazing.
Also interesting, five US patents assigned to CPFilms Inc. (7,405,872, 7,295,368, 7,177,075, 6,891,667, and 6,859,310) contain this golden nugget:
"A flexible transparent sheet made in accordance with this invention may also be used to minimize acoustic transmissions from a building by carefully applying the film to the window with an adhesive while making certain that no visible air bubbles are formed between the flexible sheet and the glazing of the window. The term "visible air bubbles" used herein means air bubbles which are visible without any magnification (i.e., visible to the naked eye). It has been discovered that when the transparent flexible sheet lies over an air bubble, the flexible sheet behaves like the diaphragm of a loudspeaker. This causes unwanted transmission of sound waves. Avoiding these bubbles minimizes the transmission of the sound waves through the window." We add that the glazing must be acoutically isolated from its
frame. Metal frames of windows and doors are very effective transmitters of signal (as well as temperature), either those received from the glass in windows or from spaces directly.
Frames need to be acoustically isolated and thermally
broken. Wood frames are much better for this purpose.
One of the shortcomings of relatively new use of cold-formed
metal studs for exterior walls is that they transmit sound
and temperature far more than masonry, so much so that
green designers recommend that they not be used despite
seeming cost savings.
Metal studs in gypsum board walls are wonderful transmitters,
indeed, the studs and gyp board may act as amplifiers, no
matter the STC rating derived from other characteristics.
Again, wood studs are preferrable, or the metal studs must
be isolated by double layering and gasketing.
Wet wood is a transmitter of signal and temperature, dry wood less so.
There are synthetics and/or composities which can take the place of wood and metal studs. Not yet cheap enough to be
used widely.
Now, metal nails, screws, brackets, masonry reinforcement,
ties, support angles and whatnot still remain a source of signal. High-strength adhesives and isolation devices
improve the resistance to transmittal.
The wondrous materials of the stealth machines may come
into architecture some day, but not soon. Well, maybe the
TLAs are using them in SCIFs, the super-versions.

The principal cause of Israeli aircraft crashes are bird strikes which cause way more losses than enemy fire. Israel is located on the main north
south route for birds going and coming between Africa and Europe. Similar
bird routes are around the globe and pose similar hazards, not least from
a crafty attacked who would use them to hide conventional anti-air
swarms of mini-craft.
It has been suggested that a pretty good anti-air campaign against Israel would be swarms of birds blending in and supplementing natural ebbs and flows.
Swarms of mini-drones, the little ones which are unarmed, not much
bigger than a model plane, could be effective against UAVs as well
as full-sized aircraft. These cost a few hundred dollars, and are hard
for radar to distinguish from birds.
There is concern that such mechanical swarms might be used against commercial airliners, with or without camouflaging bird flocks. Some
are very quiet, running on batteries not the customary noisemakers.
Can a disposal drone home in on a soldier's radio signal? Sure, using
the same signal technology as model planes. Call them snipers for
assassination politics.
It is reported that the US military is working on similar systems. Some
are water-borne to go after surface ships with a radar profile no different
than a wave or a leaping fish. No doubt a submarine version is in the works or already exists. Put the armed dolphins out of work.

What a fuck-up.
Alexa, for Managed by Association Management Solutions,
is eager to slip this pernicious "management" spy tool into

What RFID does is spy on participants, a sneaky practice promoted
by the RFID industry working through senior executives who love
to monitor underlings.
Surely the IETF membership is not clueless about the well-founded
villainy of RFID. Has there been negative feedback to Alexa's
management subterfuge?
Begin forwarded message:
Registration for IETF 76 will open in the next several days and we
want to alert you to some exciting changes coming your way.
1) New Meeting Registration System
We have moved to a new meeting registration system. The first time you
use the new system (called ARO) you will need to create an account.
Your account will be password protected and only you will have access
to it. Your contact information will be saved, making registration in
the future much simpler, and you will be able to update your contact
data, registration information, etc at any time.
2) RFID Tagging Experiment at IETF 76
The hosts for IETF 76 are organizing a RFID tag experiment for the
meeting. The tag will be affixed to the underside of your meeting
badge, as a sticker, and will contain only your full name and any
listed affiliation. The experiment will allow us to explore the
possibility of electronic blue sheets (though we are still using paper
blue sheets as the official blue sheets of record). We also hope that
the RFID tag will improve the experience for remote participants,
since speakers will be identified through the RFID tags.
While you will be given the option to "opt out" of this experiment
when you register for the meeting, we sincerely hope you will
3)  One-day Guest Pass Experiment
For IETF 76 we are also offering a one-day guest pass for $200. If you
only plan to attend one day of meetings, you now have the option to
select which day (Mon, Tues, Weds, Thurs or Fri) when you register.
After the meeting, we will solicit your feedback on the one-day pass
option and evaluate to see if it makes sense to offer at future
Please contact me if you have any comments or questions. And I look
forward to seeing you at IETF 76 in Japan!

Swiss Banking Executive and Swiss Lawyer Charged with
Conspiring to Defraud the United States
Defendants Aided Wealthy Americans Conceal Assets in
Secret Swiss Bank Accounts
WASHINGTON - Hansruedi Schumacher and Matthias Rickenbach,
both of Switzerland, were indicted today for conspiring to defraud
the United States, the Justice Department and Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) announced. According to the indictment, Schumacher
worked as an executive manager at Neue Zuercher Bank (NZB), a
Swiss private bank located in Zurich, Switzerland. Rickenbach
worked as a Swiss attorney who provided legal advice and services
to U.S. clients. Both are alleged to have aided wealthy Americans
conceal assets and income in Switzerland from United States
According to the indictment, Schumacher and Rickenbach helped
wealthy American clients conceal their assets by establishing
sham and nominee offshore entities to hide their U.S. clients'
assets and income while allowing these clients to still control
the assets and make investment decisions.
The indictment further alleges that Schumacher and Rickenbach
regularly traveled to the United States to conduct banking and
investment activities with their U.S. clients and that when they
traveled they concealed their business activities in the United
States by falsely representing to American authorities that they
were traveling to the U.S. for personal reasons. While in the
United States, the defendants would sometimes bring cash
for their clients.
According to court documents, Schumacher and Rickenbach
aided their wealthy American clients repatriate money back
to the United States using several deceptive means. Schumacher
and Rickenbach helped their clients obtain offshore credit cards
and created sham loan documents. Additionally, Schumacher
and Rickenbach falsified bank documents to generate the
appearance that assets of their U.S. clients belonged to Swiss
citizens, and they falsified documents to disguise their United
States clients' repatriation of offshore funds as inheritances
from foreign citizens.
According to court documents, Schumacher and Rickenbach
discouraged their U.S. clients from voluntarily coming into
compliance in the United States. Instead, the defendants
encouraged their clients to transfer their assets from UBS,
a large Swiss bank, to NZB, a smaller bank in Switzerland.
The defendants told their clients that their assets and
identification would be safer at NZB because they had no
presence in the United States and was therefore less likely
to be pressured by the American authorities to disclose the
identities of their United States clients.

United States, Monaco Sign Tax Information Exchange Agreement
WASHINGTON  The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced
that the United States and Monaco have signed an agreement to allow for
the exchange of information on tax matters between the two countries.
The agreement was signed by Deputy Secretary Neal Wolin and Minister
Franck Biancheri in Washington.
"This Administration is wholeheartedly committed to combating offshore
tax evasion," said Deputy Secretary Wolin.  "We are working with countries
like Monaco to ensure that the IRS has access to the information that it
needs to enforce U.S. tax law.  Today's agreement serves as an example
for other financial centers around the world and reflects our continued
efforts to end the use of offshore accounts as a tool for tax evasion."
The Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) with Monaco will
provide the United States with access to information it needs to enforce
U.S. tax laws, including information related to bank accounts in Monaco.
The TIEA will permit the United States to seek information from Monaco,
beginning in 2010, on all types of taxes in both civil and criminal matters
regarding 2009 and later tax years.  As is customary with such agreements,
only specific tax authorities will be allowed to
receive and send information.
Information exchanged pursuant to the TIEA may be used only for tax
purposes, and the tax authorities must safeguard the confidentiality of
information exchanged pursuant to the TIEA.
In recent months, the Administration has demonstrated its commitment
to closing the tax gap.  At the G-20 Leaders' Summit in London, the U.S.
strongly supported efforts to ensure that all countries adhere to
international standards for exchange of tax information.  In the FY
2010 Budget, the Administration delivered a detailed reform agenda
to reduce the amount of taxes lost through unintended loopholes and
the illegal use of hidden accounts by well-off individuals.  The Treasury
Department has concluded Gibraltar's first-ever tax information
exchange agreement and has also concluded an agreement with
  Luxembourg to provide for greater exchange of tax information. In
June, the Treasury Department announced an agreement with
Switzerland to amend the U.S.-Switzerland income tax treaty to
provide for increased tax information exchange.

Eugen is right, the drones are targeted by coodinates
not by sight. Sight (or video) is used to spot the target,
then the target's coordinates are input to the data
collection, then the operator extracts the coordinates
to aim the missile, then the missile takes over.
The drone may have moved several miles away by then
but the missile will hammer to the coordinates. Time delay
makes no difference.
Sometimes the target;s coordinates are triangulated by
one or more drones, and maybe confirmation by a satellite,
to refine the coordinates for a smaller hit circle. But that is
done only if the target is stationary, one on the move may
be targeted very quickly, and tracked visually to confirm
the hit, to cheers in the USA.
These visual assassinations are what gives hard-ons at
CIA HQ (and wherever else they are piped to), sometimes
shown during lunch at the director's private dining room,
7th floor corner suite -- the kitchen's ventilation ducts and
burn-bag chimney adjacent make a nice target for payback.
Imagine the surprise if a counter or rogue drone did at Langley
what they do in AFPAK to people watching TV over dinner.
There do not appear to be anti-missile batteries at Langley
like those in DC and MD to protect POTUS aircraft. Could
be they are obscured in the public sat photos.
More likely security by obscurity is trumped by vanity that
nobody could do what the US does, well, excepting 9/11.

Peer review is necessary to assure blunders are not overlooked.
However, there has been no demonstration that peer review is all
that is needed for the superior protection. This is not an argument
for obscurity, only a caution that peer review is not necessary
sufficient. Peers miss stuff too, as amply demonstrated by holes
and bad implementation later discovered.
Betting you life on peer review, or open disclosure is probably
not very smart. Instead, expect some shrewd peer(s) to see
something that will serve a private purpose by keeping quiet.
Competiton, betrayal, disinfo, venality, play a role as well
as search for truth through open discourse.

The open source methodology, call it snakeoil, works well
for the inexpert to gain a limited education, but behind that stage

Keeping quiet about crypto cracks, holes, trojans, backdoors,

ones is SOP.
Note that wide crypto use has become a stimulus to intercept,
store forever (NSA policy), crack when possible and to continue
trying to crack indefinitely (NSA policy), with successful deep
cracks seldom revealed. "NSA policy" is that of deeply embedded

Some have been subsquently identified -- by self-revelation or

the C-13 from natural gas and coal (via Fischer-Tropsch reaction, etc), and
possibly from petroleum as well. In addition, oxygen could be distilled to
remove most O-17 isotope in fixed applications (power plants).
In December 2009 I wrote two certified letters (each) to Al Gore and Obama.

> i say again:
 > twitter is ruining the internets...
I agree, but I think it's highlighting an underlying issue that we've
been letting the wrong sort of people on the internet for a long time.
I tend to think that if this type of people ends up sticking to the
world of twitter and facebook and co, then we can safely caution them
off and just ignore them at large, so for that purpose it works well
Multiple, discrete internets are coming into play, perhaps have always
First, the known internets, utilizing ubiquitious access logging which
under guise of administration allows universal spying:
1. The internet run by operators of the overall background system
which most users know little about or care.
2 The open policing apparatus of the overall system run by governments
and their contractors and cooperating non-profits.
3. The commercial internet providing services or products for pay.
4. The non-profit, open-source, volunteer internet providing services
or products at no cost or for donations.
5. The closed sub-internets, mil-gov classified, SCADA, restricted
and special purpose networks used by operators and administrators of
backbones, nodes, satellite, cable, wired and wireless systems,
Second, the unknown internets, with or without evident access logging:
6. The covert policing and spying internet which watches, logs,
mucks around, runs stings, causes accidents and shut-downs, cuts
cables, runs surprise tests and attacks, and keeps alive the demand
for covert oversight of all the known others.
7. The covert internets which hide among all the others, or try to
subject to discovery by 6.
8. The evanescent internets which are set up, used and disappear
quickly, openly or covertly, subject to 6.
9. The wayward and waylaid internets which cannot be identified:
rogues, experiments, mistakes, erratic systems, unexpected
glitches and consequences, acts of nature, forgotten protocols,
inept code, destructive code, lost access techniques, death
of the perpetrators.
10. Internets of combinations, hybrids, deceptions, ploys and
warfare among 1-9.

Yes, ten subscribers left and none not a rat.
New York Times today has at least three articles about online
spying, two in the back of the business section, one as the
principal piece in the Sunday Magazine, unusually long.
The magazine piece describes encouragement of people
to put everything out there as if a marvelous way to socialize.
Some coverage of the delirium of advertisers, such as the
Times, at this oil spill of free data.
One of the business articles focuses on Twitter giving all its
messages to the Library of Congress, and the delirium of
scholars at getting this oil spill of data unmediated by
authoritatives like the Times and greeders themselves.
Twitter claims it strongly emphasizes to its users about the
public nature of their data. Says it thinks its privacy policy
should be called a public policy, but that California requires
a privacy policy so it keeps the deception going to comply
with law.
All is online spying is lawful, and the data snatchers are
delirious with pleasure about it. Marc Rotenberg at EPIC
is the sole source quoted as saying US privacy policy is
totally fucked up. The article implies the EU approach is
better, despite there being no other governments on earth
that spy on its people more than the EU, and which blames
the US and China and Russia and anybody else handy for
being the threat.
Finally, a Times editorial today praises Google for its recent
disclosure of government requests for data. Says Google
intends to turn over the actual requests to an unnamed
non-profit for publication. Still no answer to what Google
does with the planetary-grade stuff it gathers, that's deeply

black boxes, monitors of kitchen appliances and crib-killer
and homicidal students and maturbating parents, and
automatic upgrades and renewals sucking your privates.
The Times chief editor says also today that the use of
anonymous sources is essential to check government
abuse, and while there are occasional abuses of the
practice that is why ombudspersons are there to keep
the Times authoritatively trustworthy. Nothing about

Lucky Green, ex-PGP official, said recently at a history of cpunks
panel that the principal disappointment of PGP.com was that too
few individuals used encryption, and that most of its use was
by corporations complying with customer privacy regulations
not for comsec.
With this in mind, individuals and corporations apparently do not
see the need for comsec, so in that sense Eric Schmidt, Google
apologist, is correct that privacy is not a big deal for those with
nothing to hide.
Phil Zimmermann, also on the panel, said nothing about PGP,
said he has moved on to a secure phone development.
The consensus was that Internet security was dead in the
water, only snake oil was successful at convincing customers
their privacy was "taken very seriously." If you read privacy
policies, and most of us don't as they evolve to be more slippery,
they are virtually identical in what they promise and admit
to customer betrayal for "lawful interception compliance."
There are a few law firms which specialize in these misleading
policies and write them to fit "acceptable industry standards."

industry and government to issue regular scare stories about

with this flimflam -- all agree that officials have the right to
violate privacy, "it's the law," and that ISPs and Internet
operators must cooperate. You want privacy, do not use
digital technology, but don't tell the gaga Internet user that.
So, if the cpunk greying beards are right, the encryption battle
of the 1990s was lost, not won. Pretending to have won is
exactly what was agreed to develop the market for "unbreakable"
One of the cpunks on the panel said the encryption battle
was not only lost, but now some of the proponents of public

oil protection racket alive and well. Wikileaks was cited as
an example but far from alone, financial data protection leads

What might be most enviable about Julian is that he has held
few if any jobs to distract him from exploring personal philosophy and to plot great conquests and become very rich. During the twenty years from about 18 to 38, he has managed to obtain food, shelter, clothing, child care payments, health care, expenses for travel and entertainment, laptops and network service, and a motorbike for 2-3 years of globe circling -- perhaps
setting up a network of cohorts. (He described his itinerary on
this noble forum in 2001.) Nothing unusual about this off-the-grid lifestyle among hackers.
Like a lot of thoughtful humans not convinced steady work for
bosses is a good thing, they do have a knack for avoiding regular employment. Some speculate they sell their hacker fruits of network (TOR, DoD,
et al) siphoning on the black market, or extort payments from targets to return material or to not report nasty info to the authorities or news media -- or most profitable, to gin up the bidding for stolen data among competitors. Say, the Bank of America ploy, "hard drive"
certified, fool.
Those not adept at keeping income coming this way, can pick up a few thousands ratting on other hacker-entrepreneurs to the authorities, or best, to commercial spies who extort the ratee for information then mark it up as their own product.
These techniques appear to be in full flower with Wikileaks and its
desparate MSM partners, agog fans and penny-ante sock-puppets, but are hardly restricted to the newbie initiative. Businesses have alwayes used the same tawdry practices to assure profitability to the bosses, to screw the workers and investors, and the methods are taught in business schools and fine-tuned in lawyers and publicist-cum-journalists' conference rooms. The deals negotiated among WL and the MSM will make great reading
in the slacker colleges someday but not so long as they are laying
golden eggs. Off the grid is where the real money flows. As is often
yelled in this very iniquitous den.
It must have been said somewhere in blatherdom that Assange's model is Zuckenberg not Harry the Rat. He is likely in touch with Goldman and
JP Morgan and the giants of Europe and Asia to get bid on the BoA wad and the others in his sample kit. Think about what he's got, or says he's

Tiversa Inc., a company based in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania, has evidence that WikiLeaks, which has said it doesnt know who provides it with information, may seek out secret data itself, using so-called
"peer-to-peer" networks, Chief Executive Officer Robert Boback claimed. He said the government is examining evidence that Tiversa has turned over.
The company, which has done investigative searches on behalf of U.S. agencies including the FBI, said it discovered that computers in Sweden were

At the core of the cypherpunk philosophy was the belief that the great question of politics in the age of the internet was whether the state would strangle individual freedom and privacy through
its capacity for electronic surveillance or whether autonomous individuals would eventually undermine and even destroy the state through their deployment of electronic weapons newly at hand."

"A banker in the West should prepare a list of irregular
numbers to be called shift numbers," he wrote. "The
difference between such numbers must not be regular.
When a shift-number has been applied, or used, it must
be erased from the list and not be used again."
That sent the astonished Dr. Bellovin to the Internet to
try to find out whether Mr. Millers innovation was known
to the later inventors.
The results of his largely online detective work can be
found in the July issue of the journal Cryptologia.  ...
According to several independent specialists in cryptography,
Mr. Miller was undoubtedly the first to propose the concept
of the one-time pad.
"Miller probably invented the one-time pad, but without
knowing why it was perfectly secure or even that it was,"
said David Kahn, the author of the definitive 1967 book
"The Codebreakers." "Moreover, unlike Mauborgnes
conscious invention, or the Germans conscious adoption
of the one-time pad to superencipher their Foreign Office
codes, it had no echo, no use in cryptology. It sank without
a trace  until Steve found it by accident."

European and other nations have long provided private data
to US spies under secret sharing agreements. Their protests
are nonsense. Hearings on these violations of their citizens

practices stop but do not order action to truly stop them. The reason is that the US (and its contractors) supplies the other nations with data on their citizens and subjects as well as funding and technology for homeland spying.
Blaming the hegemon-of-choice is obligatory strut.
And most importantly spies do not have to obey laws anywhere and provide exculpation for their mercenaries.

If there's so let us
A fundamental characteristic of non-toy (especially unbreakable!)
encryption is that any failure is due to implementation or some
other fault beyond the cipher.
This indefensible circularity is audacious but necessary for
the illusory claims for a strong cipher.
In more recent times, another necessary illusion is that if a cipher has been broken it will be publicly revealed.
Despite the ancient concealment of vulnerabilities of
ciphersystems in order to exploit trust in them.
Then there is the argument that different standards of
cipher protection must be declared in order to determine
whether a cipher meets a standard. And this leads to
an ever receding standard for the best and a pile-up of
lesser promises unmet.
And there is a presumption that the best encryption will be expropriated by national governments and their selected
agents and must be kept out of the hands of the governed.
Hence, best ciphersystems are never revealed or disappear
from public view via official secrecy classification or NDA.
These evasions are used by cipher (and security)
snake oil peddlers to maximum advantage such that it is probably wise to consider all cipher (security) systems snake oil, or more precisely, toys requiring sophisticated marketing and exculpations of failure -- at which crypto

Tor is not alone in misleading users about online security.
It would be worth repeating that security online, as offline,
is always an iffy promise and that communication and
identity-protection caution is a basic requirement.
Offerers of security in whatever guise -- national,
governmental, commercial, organizational, religious,
individual -- are well aware of the limits of what is being offered and thus over-promise to conceal those limits.
Security should be understood to mean limited security,
which is how security experts know it. A few of them laugh,
or growl, at the ease with which scoundrels among them
deceive the public. Most, however, enjoy the rewards of keeping quiet, or most likely, shading the truth in such a way that when vulnerabilities are exposed -- ie, people die (far more than sacrosanct journalists, entire duped
populations) -- they roll out the usual exculpations of charging the victims with complicity in their suffering for believing what they were told.
Never trust a security expert for they an incapable of
knowing the full consequences of what they are advising
about, having been trained to fudge, blather, brag, warn, and promulgate the faith.
Security means to blame the victim, that is, require to
the victim to believe in corrupt security, to never doubt the security offerers, all of whom are motherfucking liars, cheats and false priests, most often in pay of those who reap great fortunes fucking the people,
themselves protected by secrecy.
Without secrecy none of this shit would work. Thus,
above all else, cloaking secrecy with evasive bullshit is essential, for example, the open source religion
which hides crimes and misdemeanors around
the globe, above and below.
Dinky revelations of vulnerabilities hide great ones.
Thus, the near monthly revelations of data hacking,
the crowing about finding holes, the issuing of new
patches and protections, the revisions of privacy
policies, the proposed new legislation and regulation
to control violations, the warnings of national attacks,
the grandstanding virii of machinic attacks, the calls
for digital identities and banning of anonymity, the
jailing of a few pipsqueak examples, the avoidance
of effective law enforcement and punishment of
major cartels and spy regimes inside and outside government, the excusing of corporate and institutional
siphoning of user data, the lack of constraint on military
arms sales and product promotiing wars, well, its a long list of what secret security fosters.
Believe nothing you hear about security, should be the
motto required of every peddler and advocate of it.
Alternatives to security are available but get no traction

Gaining access to MegaUpload's emails, business records and

As often discussed here, the use of military capabilities developed
for national security for civilian criminal affairs matters is amply indicated in the MegaUpload indictment.
Indicting in the US, in particular in the Eastern District of Virginia,
the pre-eminent national security court, also indicates a bias
toward national security undergirding arguments for economic
security threat. That too was often debated here in the crypto
wars of the 1990s.
Recent defense funding authorization of holding alleged
terrorists indefinitely, keeping Gitmo alive, SOPA, PIPA, MegaUpload, Bradley Manning, WikiLeaks, huge funding
increases for openly hiring hackers and paying those undecover to rat on cohorts, also reminds of the extra-legalities
and betrayals of the early public crypto era.

threats, bribes, scholarships, contracts, stigma, isolation,
betrayals, call that the After Echelon Option -- it should be expected that the same means and methods will be used in cyber wars, offense and defense mutually aggrandizing

Note that there have been a slew of seeming public interest
comsec initiatives in recent years to address cyber threats combined with threats to privacy. Observing the particpants in these there are quite a few recognizable warriors from the crypto-comsec-privacy wars. Fine minds and good hearts still proposing technological solutions to the issues, warning of legal if not military oppostion. Ginning up more technical fixes to comsec and privacy, reminding of past errors and promises gone awry, sniping at one another, admitting NDA withholdings, parading an impressive list of corporate domains after the nyms.
Optimistically, using the wind down of the Cold War as
a precedent, when crypto wizards came of out of classified
realms due to decline of nat sec jobs, the wind down of GWOT could lead to comsec wizards coming out of similarly classified realms to aid civilians against those remaining in the world
of secrecy worldwide.
It would be a swell outcome of classified research to heed
its inherent dual use once again on the dual use Internet:

The group met over the weekend at a code-a-thon organized by Julia Angwin of The Wall Street Journal, which has chronicled the spread of commercial surveillance in everyday technology in a vital series of articles and engaging online demonstrations called What They Know.

This Machine Kills Secrets: How WikiLeakers, Cypherpunks,
and Hacktivists Aim to Free the World's Information [Hardcover]
Andy Greenberg
Publication Date: September 13, 2012
The barbarians aren't at the gates. They're inside. This is the first full
account of the cypherpunks who aim to free the world's information,
from the Forbes reporter whose work has traced their history and future.
What is the machine that kills secrets?
WikiLeaks brought to light a new form of whistleblowing, using
powerful cryptographic code to hide leakers' identities while
they spill the private data of government agencies and corporations.
But that technology has been evolving for decades in the hands of
hackers and radical activists, from the libertarian enclaves of
Northern California to Berlin to the Balkans. And the secret-killing
machine continues to evolve beyond WikiLeaks, as a movement
of hacktivists aims to obliterate the world's institutional secrecy.
This is the story of the code and the characters -- idealists,
anarchists, extremists -- who are transforming the next generation's
notion of what activism can be.
With unrivaled access to such major players as Julian Assange,
Daniel Domscheit-Berg, and WikiLeaks' shadowy engineer known
as the Architect, never before interviewed, reporter Andy Greenberg
unveils the world of politically-motivated hackers -- who they are
and how they operate.

RT blurb:
-Cypherpunks is a movement originating from
Cypherpunks Electronic Mailing List, which was
set up by activists aiming to improve Internet
privacy and security through proactive use of
cryptography. The movement has been active since
the late 1980s. WikiLeaks is one of the many projects derived from
A furious invisible war over our society is
underway. Finer technologies to collect netizens
private data pop up every week  and what now
exactly is private? Julian Assange asks his
Cypherpunk guests: is the worlds future tied to the Internet?
-WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, gets back in
touch with the Cypherpunks movement to discuss
the unseen battlefield  the Internet: how cyber
wars are no longer a sheer paranoid fantasy, how
your life turns into goods sold at the market,
why a math problem is not exactly a problem when
private data is concerned and what the best
antidote is to political storytelling.
"A furious invisible war" is no longer a poetic
comparison, you will find out, and this is a battle in your backyard.

Tor-talk unsubbed me yesterday, probably for publishing on Cryptome
Eugen's forward of this thread's initial message from Roger Dingledine,
with our additional pointers to enduring USG funding of the Tor Project.
That Tor Project has enlisted many dedicated participants around the
world is most admirable. If it was not so jingoistic and US-promotional
it would be a crowd-source service deserving of trustworthiness.
Its long-time funding by the USG propanda agency, the Broadcast Board
of Govenors, as well as several front organizations, is not to be overlooked
by incessant braggardy, technical conceit and thin-skinnedness by its
spokespersons, primarily majordomos Andrew Newman and Jacob
Appelbaum, now joined by sub-lieutenants to admit not serious faults
in the system. (The inventors and most capable technologists of Tor
do not exaggerate its virtues.)
Tor Project's duplicity reminds of ICANN and a slew of other USG TLA to maintain control of the Internet while espousing a US-centric version
of information freedom which actually serves as a component of the
US national security regime.
State Department brags of the thousands of info fighters it is subsidizing,
and NSA is openly recruiting hackers. It should be assumed that the TLAs
have co-opted Anonymous-like initiatives in concert with pernicious
sockpuppetry in social media.
Tor Project would benefit from escaping USG financial clutches, albeit
difficult if dependency has become inured. The proposal to expand USG
funding for exit relays -- its most vulnerable and compromisable aspect --
is a gift horse needing a dental check before buying in.

them who play war games in media, on consoles, in code and in

Under the decades-old five-party surveillance agreement --
US, UK, CA, AU and NZ, also known as Echelon -- the nations
share information and swap staff. They also spy on each other's
citizens when barred from doing so directly.
The tricky part is if an temporary NSA staff member in CA is sitting next to
a CA member spying on US citizens (same for the roles swapped)
is there a literal firewall between the two's computers as well as
physically between the staff, or is that handled by lawyers waving
magic wands, as do the CIA's lawyers finger a drone target.
The other tricky part is what is called "de minimus" spying on
citizens where if a signal of a banned target is "inadvertently"
acquired how thoroughly is the signal quashed. One version
says that the spying agency archives the signal, indefinitely,
and does not distribute to customers (unless winked by
lawyers), but is everready to retrieve the signal should
circumstances and secret presidential orders demand
as with the EFF/ATT/NSA affair.
Utah Data Center is reportedly being built to store virtually
unlimited amounts of data and signal in the expectation that
everything may become useful at some point, with newly
born algorithms sifting for overlooked needles.
In this sense, it is reasonable to assume that Echelon has
been superceded by secret laws allowing the spies to do
whatever is needed to spy their citizens and anybody else --
leaving open-ended what "needed" means to avoid another
Pearl Harbor, OMG!
Perpetual war justifies this full-dominance pan-survellience,
as recently reported in WaPo with respect to drones and
the spying acquiring citizen targets, including those of
the five-parties who foolishly question authority with
the expectation that freedom of expression is inviolable.

nationhood was invented to delude citizens into believing
royal secrecy and greed was over not insitutionalized
in the world's spying machines, aka, telecommunications,
Internet, Tor, encryption, anonymizers, WOT, human
rights initiatives, cyber-freedom fighting.
One way to de minimizing yourself is to work for the

do you learn about how they spy on insiders -- for life,
using the tried and true means and methods of

Assange-WikiLeaks Crypto Arms Call Triple Cross
Applying cryptography's bag of tricks to Julian Assange's
introduction to the new book, Cypherpunks: Freedom and the
Future of the Internet, entitled "A Call to Cryptographic Arms,"
it could be taken as a "A Cryptographic Call to Arms," that is,
an encrypted warning contained within the plain text.
Assange and WikiLeaks, like cypherpunks, is masterfully wily
at practicing the characteristic cryptography feature of duplicity,
never revealing what is going on beneath public assurances of
Assange and WikiLeaks, like cypherpunks, invoke open-closed
cryptographic duplicity as his personal behavior and as the policy
of the WikiLeaks initiative. Concealing, obscuring and diverting
his personal affairs while seeking publicity, and concealing,
obscuring and diverting the inner affairs of the operation  for
disclosing documents openly. This is cryptography in action.
In the same fashion Assange-WikiLeaks has periodically published
encrypted packages as "insurance" against takedown, it has also
released the unredacted State Department cables by way of a
complicated, presumably, orchestrated, leak. The leak of the
password to the cable collection by giving it to journalists to
publish is a classic instance of cryptographic dupery.
Cryptography formulates threats, ruses, disclosures, ploys,
diversions, deceptions, double-crosses, triple-crosses to hide
strengths and weaknesses, attacks and defenses, lies and
dissimulations, assurances of innocence and candor.
Crypto AG is a classic instance of NSA deception, among many,
to install a backdoor in a widely adopted encrypted system, then
leaked decades later as a warning to those who think they can
obtain fully secure communication systems.
A recent example if that of open source cryptography promoted
as means to verify encryption systems by public disclosure and
examination. Its shortcoming, and virtue to the wily, is that far
from all cryptographers subscribe to the sharing venture -- notably
those associated with governments, corporations and mendacious
individual efforts, instead take open source and not reveal what is
found of its weaknesses (to be exploited in secret) nor what is done
with the gift. US spies have admitted they take open source but do
not give back.
The same could be said of leak sites, anonymizers, IRC, news and
mail groups, social media, Skype, varieties of comsec offerings, and
the Internet itself among its many levels of access. Offer services,
free, paid, purloined or onioned, for which the take is much greater
than the offerings -- the standard asymmetric-warfare model, derived
from governance, education, non-profits and history's all-time leader,
religion, the latter exceeded only by wily hyenas patrolling the herd
to mount novel attacks to take down over-confident herdmasters.
Cryptographers do not trust one another. Cypherpunks triple cross
as ruse.
Consider that the Assange-WikiLeaks book Cypherpunks is a
cryptographic ruse which conveys an encrypted body of secrets,
additional insurance against the takedown of Assange and WikiLeaks
to be declared after the volume is widely distributed in print and
e-book form. A modern Lutherian proclamation of open and
encrypted dissent against the corruption of closed and secret
Further, imagine that Assange-WikiLeaks is planting encrypted
bits in all its releases which can be decrypted at a future time,
to re-assemble into a larger disclosure. In the world of cryptography
this would be expected.  Cypherpunks advocate this encrypted
concealment, dispersion, distribution and future coalescence.
Pre-positioning attacks and defenses well before they are needed
is conventional warfare -- as well as political, economic and
philosophical enterprise. Cypherpunks, before, during and after
WikiLeaks, has pre-positioned encrypted packs of arms demurely

This cryptographic call to arms is a triple-cross under a double-cross

That the Internet is a gigantic spying machine has been known since
its invention, the security industry has made billions pretending to
protect against its surveillance.
Schneier has also written recently that security does not work,
cannot work, that attackers are always going to excell over defenders,
due to the economic incentives to attack being greater than those
to defend.
Long a top expert selling security services, what is Schneier up to
with gloom and doom that is usually associated with selling
snake oil -- his favorite target. Has his amply promoted 24x7 services
been defeated by attackers? Is he keeping that quiet? Is he about to
be doxed, has been hit with a blackmail demand, or worse, his
defenses compromised? Who else among the experts are colluding
with this initiative to admit Internet deception from the git go?
Recall that beloved Peter Neumann and others advocate chucking
the current Internet and starting over with better security and privacy
basic requirements. Uh huh, and what will take its place, will it be
better or more snake oil? And what to do with all that stored data
of the world's greatest spying machine promoted with the complicity
of Internet advocates and the security industry?
Pardon, monsieur, foxes in the hen house, comes to mind.
Schneier says in his security-is-doomed-to-fail piece a public discussion
is needed on what to do, the experts don't have answers. That's a good
start after years of experts promising to do better next time, meanwhile
trust open source, trust us.
Where does snake oil end and "something better" begin?
Is something better ever not snake oil? Is a public discussion
of an issue never not rigged in favor of the organizers? Is
tumultous public discussion never not preamble to a coup
justified as needed to control the mob who has gotten out

Has subquantum crypto attack been substantiated?
arXiv:quant-ph/0203049v2 12 Apr 2002
Subquantum Information and Computation
Antony Valentini
It is argued that immense physical resources  for nonlocal communication,
espionage, and exponentially-fast computation  are hidden from us by quantum
noise, and that this noise is not fundamental but merely a property of an
equilibrium state in which the universe happens to be at the present time. It
is suggested that non-quantum or nonequilibrium matter might exist today in
the form of relic particles from the early universe. We describe how such matter
could be detected and put to practical use. Nonequilibrium matter could be
used to send instantaneous signals, to violate the uncertainty principle, to distinguish
non-orthogonal quantum states without disturbing them, to eavesdrop
on quantum key distribution, and to outpace quantum computation (solving
NP-complete problems in polynomial time). ...
6 Eavesdropping on Quantum Key Distribution
Alice and Bob want to share a secret sequence of bits that will be used as a
key for cryptography. During distribution of the key between them, they must
be able to detect any eavesdropping by Eve. Three protocols for quantum key
distribution  BB84 [20], B92 [21], and E91 (or EPR) [22]  are known to be
secure against classical or quantum attacks (that is, against eavesdropping based
on classical or quantum physics) [23]. But these protocols are not secure against
a subquantum attack [7]. ...
E91 is particularly interesting for it relies on the completeness of quantum
theory  that is, on the assumption that there are no hidden elements of reality.
Pairs of spin-1/2 particles in the singlet state are shared by Alice and Bob, who
perform spin measurements along random axes. For coincident axes the same bit
sequence is generated at each wing, by apparently random quantum outcomes.
The eavesdropper cannot elicit any information from the particles while in
transit ..... because there is no information encoded there [22]. But our Eve has
access to information outside the domain of quantum theory. She can measure
the particle positions while in transit, without disturbing the wavefunction, and
so predict the outcomes of spin measurements at the two wings (for the publicly
announced axes).12 Thus Eve is able to predict the key shared by Alice and

A swell beginning, for email to be merely one way to
communicate, supplemented with unlimited other
ways which do not require email, or for that matter,
the Internet or any digital means.
Presume that digital means are the easiest to fuck with,
sorry, subvert, corrupt, pack with junk, surveil, harvest,
store, search, forge, track, make your own list on your
digital device and expect it to be violated accordingly
and used against you whether you know or not, usually
not. Here especially.
Now the other means, non-digital, ancient and amply
used and understood among those who use them
although susceptible to the digital vulnerabilites if
considerable more difficult:
Plastic arts
Graphic arts
And much more everybody uses with greater facility
than digital emissions.
Note that conventional lanugages are not on the list
because of the heavy reliance upon them to communicate
and thus most heavily scutinized and attacked, usually
Language is like metadata, with only its mastery the content
can be followed from end to end, then the ends burgled,
beat, cut, shot, persuaded to talk in plain language.
Steagonagraphy is not on the list unless it is non-digital,
and if not, then hiding communication has great potential.
Its weakness is finding a means, non-digital, for preparation
and transceiving.
For example, architecture is an ancient means of communication,
among its funders, designers, builders, maintainers, destructors,
restorers, investors, evaluators, burgler, surveyors, surveillors,
protectors, attackers, underminers, repairers, materials suppliers,
excavators, and a host of participants -- the list of guilds and unions
and professionals is vast -- perhaps one of the largest cohorts
of quasi-private aggregations on earth lagging only farmers
if taken to mean any form of human construction. I flatter
myself, so do yourself likewise.
Similarly, just about any specialty of human intercourse has
its quasi-private, esoteric, unique means of communication.
The human body specialists -- scientific, shamanistic, soulseeking --
along with its pschobabbling corollary, generates a fantastic
array of marketable, if not wholly, believable garble and
gibberish. Politics and law the most vivid at laying on the
self-serving shit about the necessity of government and
the rule of law(yers).
Now back to the simple task of communicating in private.
Before that, a side note, the end is near:
First do not expect anyone to believe anything using the
word "security." So comsec is dead due to abuse. Maybe
compriv is better, understanding that privacy has become
a crock of shit too.
"Shit bag" (thanks to Assange) Natsec needs to go as well
because it has been abused the most of all since assuming
the parmount importance of a secular religion prevailing
over all belief-systems with deadly weaponry, heartlessness,
amorality, criminality and unaccountability, motto: fuck with
it and you will die. Much evidence of motto in deed. And
much evidence it will be used against its insiders.
This is relevant to private communication. Natsec really
hates being cut out of any kind of communication. It
will use virtually unlimited means to get inside, most
of them kept secret and manifestly violent if needs
So compriv should not be promoted as capable to
exclude natsec's prying, stealing, owning, using to
demolish with its opponents. OTR is futile, BTW,
as comsec.
Wind compriv down to comchat. Then wind comchat
down to comgossip, to comwhine, comjoke, comlie,
comlurk, comslur, com-social engineer. You get the
point. Do nothing life-threatening or natsec defying
by com-whatever. Communications is owned by
those who provide its means and they are owned
by extremely badass natsec ritualists willing to
barbecue your beloveds to share the goodness
carefully prescribed in their secret manuals of

In conclusion, there you have it, com-bat, the most

Comsec experts should not be surprised at the Snowden
revelations about NSA so far, most of which are venerable.
What is surprising is their seemingly exaggerated surprise
because many of them worked at or ran firms which were
known to be heavily involved with official spying through
dual-use technology and dual-purpose contracts.
With USG and world governments, with banks and telecoms,
with comsec, software and anti-virus firms, with universities
and research institutes, with FOI organizations and public
interest advisory boards, with vulture investors, TED and
Aspen, with revolving doors among goverment, industry,
education, journalism, banking and Wall Street, with RAND,
NRL, the national laboratories, to name a few.
In most instances these dual roles were not hidden.
Or were they?
What might be troubling about Snowden's possible
revelations that is causing exaggerated surprise of
these experts is the disclosure that the dual-uses
and dual-roles in spying were more extensive than
has been made public. That has been protected by
highest secrecy about to be breached, not about
the spy agencies but those used to camouflage
and assist the spying by downplaying its pervasiveness
by selling protection that could never be wholly
effective, that the cybersec game was as rigged
as gambling.
That the backdoors, vulnerabilities, holes, faults,

then it should be an enjoyable past time for innocents avoiding
their future of really bad shit planned in official secrecy
protected by encryption for their use as cannon fodder.
Just a reminder that encryption is a munitions whose only

Emitting signal that "crypto works" is a hoary practice, nothing
more useful than a belief in an uncrackable means of comms,
used often in war and commerce and love affairs. Crypto-AG,
AES, PGP, Tor, OTR, offline exchange of keys, the list is
growing with each disclosure that something stinks in crypto
Getting the best and brightest (BAB) to affirm that crypto works,
say by open and limited competitions as well as by confidential
testing results leaked, would be a part of that campaign.
Leaking other forms of attack, like metadata, would be another
part, bit by bit, authenticity heightened by obligatory redactions
and vetting by quiet government consultation.
Presume Snowden dribbling juicy comsec architecture and data,
witting or unwitting of their ulterior purpose as beautifully
crafted to appear suspicious to BABs but so tasty to be irresistable
as a floating British officer corpse stuffed with secret war
plans retrieved by the Germans.
Until all of Snowden's booty is released and carefully studied by
virulently suspicious and paranoid BABs not snared by sweet
contracts to muse and declare authenticity, it cannot be seen
as more than an ingenious ruse, likely with the complicity of
the BABs once believed to be poorly-paid angels dancing
on a pinhead.
The saluatory benefit of these ruses is to shock the shit out
of the lazy and arrogant comfuckers whose stake is put at
risk by being left out of the ruse, not easy to do if they are

crypto lists and fora and history confabbing at NSA.
None of this is intended to impugn the few BABs who
remain outside secret circles, or at least appear to do
so in best and brightest ways. And don't invoke a hoary
NSL as basis for silence.
It does intend to impugn denial of the inevtiable
failure of crypto alone or in concert with infrastructure.
Remember that 1997 NSA paper foretelling the fail.

To hide the file and its size, the compressed CAD drawing or

"I remember an early example of the solution of the problem of producing
strictly one-time perforated tape. A Canadian engineer working for a
British intelligence organization in New York who knew nothing
at all about cryptography produced in 1942 an on-line machine called
TELEKRYPTON. He generated his tapes by pouring a mixture of
metal and glass balls through a hopper, the metal halls alone passing
current and perforating 5-level tape. He analyzed the result and saw
that it was biased, owing to the heavier weight of the metal balls, and
then changed the respective sizes of the balls to compensate for the
extra weight of the metal."

Tor Project discussion lists have become characterized by a
a tone of dismissiveness, knee-jerkedness, when critiques
are presented. This is pretty common in such fora as they
age and lazy old-timers put down newbies as if a sport,
shooting fish in a barrel, or as in this instance, flogging a
dead horse.
Occasionally, again as in this instance of critiquing Hidden

putdown. The more experienced Tor contributors are not
as susceptible to putdowns as the middling and bottomers,
certainly not as offensive as the Tor Project promoters,
funders and fans.
It would be helpful to distinguish between those who know
onion-routing in depth and those who advocate its use
with what often appears to be primarily public relations and
advertizing disdain toward critics and inquirers.
Reviewing the depth of research at the Naval Research Laboratory
on network security and anonymization indicates that serious
research has been done long before Tor Project appeared.
Three of those researchers are affiliated with Tor Project
and keep it from being dubious flim-flammery in which
posing and pontificating front for technical inexperience.
Tor Project is more like a sales operation for scientific and
engineering endeavors. And in that role it boosts and promotes,
sounding sometimes like snake oil, another overused cliche,
than the skeptical and inquiring research at scientists and
engineers at the NRL.
Tor fora suffer the same consequences as this one, producing
mostly shallow bullshit, mea culpa, with occasional leads for
pursuing offline endeavors requiring much time for lasting
Chat and mail lists, like reader comments and polls, have
become promotional gimmicks, run by PR hustlers with
about as much knowledge of discussion topics as
salespeople usually have.
One clue to unreliability is when a former engineer takes over
sales and deploys promotional hyperbole as the principal
marketing tool on fora, at talks, with speeches, articles,
interviews, fund-raisers, documentaries, books, parties,
conferences, 2P2, F2F, debates, all aimed at dominating
a niche.
In Tor Project's case, propaganda for illusory anonymity
has become its main product, as befits an org established
and funded by the USG for that purpose.
Naval Research Laboratory should not be demeaned to
the level of the all too slick Tor Project. And chattering
on Tor fora should not to be confused with substantial

One of the many eccentricities of crypto is speculating on how
long and how much computing power would be needed to crack
a particular cryptosystem, its algorithm or "implementation."
A favorite of popular writing on the topic, it is likely these
claims are pure fiction fabricated to satisfy headlines and
deadlines -- and, as always, to market or rididule a competitor's
piece of shit.
No Wikipedia entry on the phrase "crypto implementation,"
the all-time favorite excuse for the shit's absolute certain failure.

DigiCert's base standard is to use 2048-bit keys in secure SSL certificates - that is enormously stronger than anything Lenstra et al attempted, in fact, it would require factoring a 617-digit number. RSA Labs claim (see:  that 2048-bit keys are 2^32 (2 to the power of 32) times harder to break using NFS, than 1024-bit keys. 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 or almost 4.3 billion, therefore breaking a DigiCert 2048-bit SSL certificate would take about 4.3 billion times longer (using the same standard desktop processing) than doing it for a 1024-bit key. It is therefore estimated, that standard desktop computing power would take 4,294,967,296 x 1.5 million years to break a DigiCert 2048-bit SSL certificate. Or, in other words, a little over 6.4 quadrillion years.
In putting together our video, we estimated the age of the Universe to be 13,751,783,021 years or a little over 13.75 billion years, therefore if you tried to break a DigiCert 2048-bit SSL certificate using a standard modern desktop computer, and you started at the beginning of time, you would have expended 13 billion years of processing by the time you got back to today, and you would still have to repeat that entire process 468,481 times one after the other into our far far distant future before there was a good probability of breaking the certificate. In fact the Universe itself would grow dark before you even got close.

How secure is AES against brute force attacks?

Even with a supercomputer, it would take 1 billion billion years to crack the 128-bit AES key using brute force attack. This is more than the age of the universe (13.75 billion years). If one were to assume that a computing system existed that could recover a DES key in a second, it would still take that same machine approximately 149 trillion years to crack a 128-bit AES key.

The clock is ticking for encryption

Today's encryption algorithms can be broken. Their security derives from the wildly impractical lengths of time it can take to do so.
Let's say you're using a 128-bit AES cipher. The number of possible keys with 128 bits is 2 raised to the power of 128, or 3.4x1038, or 340 undecillion. Assuming no information on the nature of the key is available (such as the fact that the owner likes to use his or her children's birthdays), a code-breaking attempt would require testing each possible key until one was found that worked.
Assuming that enough computing power was amassed to test 1 trillion keys per second, testing all possible keys would take 10.79 quintillion years. This is about 785 million times the age of the visible universe (13.75 billion years). On the other hand, you might get lucky in the first 10 minutes.
But using quantum technology with the same throughput, exhausting the possibilities of a 128-bit AES key would take about six months. If a quantum system had to crack a 256-bit key, it would take about as much time as a conventional computer needs to crack a 128-bit key.
A quantum computer could crack a cipher that uses the RSA or EC algorithms almost immediately.

@_subject: Political Cypherpunks Trumps Apolitical Cryptography 
What is striking about discussion on the two cryptography mail
lists, both set up to minimize discussing political and social
issues to avoid cypherpunks acceptance of them, is the
tentative reconsideration of those issues due to Snowden's
revelations, miniscule as they are.
Notable among those raising the political threat are those
who disdained the issue on cypherpunks and stomped off
to set up alternatives ham-handedly moderated to cease
and desist the "off-topic."
A few now say, bray more like it, NSA has betrayed us
through political manipulation of officials and the public,
and that is an important point which often came up on
cypherpunks and still does, with somewhat less
complaining about it.
For Snowden has shown the political has won out over
the technical, and the technicals are fraught with what to
do about it, and much fingerpointing is going on along with
a few claims of having forewarned this betrayal would
happen. No moderation yet has shut down this "off-topic."
But much gumming and gnawing of the futility of technical
means against the vulgar political.
What has been shown in the discussion is that the
technical wizards are not nearly as competent at the
messy political as they are at technical sophistication.
The resulting conversation is a mish-mash of fairly
high level technical discourse interleaved with fairly
clumsy political opinionating. So technical clubs
are being swung to answer political jabs, that is
petty squabblling and exchange of slurs has replaced
rational discourse. Thus the convo has become
politicized with as much stupidity and ignorance
as sharp thinking and mutual respect.
NSA and its bosses would be happy if this became
the norm in cryptography as in the real world. And some
opine that this outcome is being, and has been in the
past, and will be in the future, orchestrated for just
that result.
That sounds like what cypherpunks was set up
to combat, the withdrawal from politcial affairs into
safe sanctuary of infallible mathematics coated with
unending challengences to implement illusory
protection from political mayhem. So it has come
to pass, there is no refuge from politics, and the once
reviled tin-hats of conspiracy theories are replacing
anomymous masks, especially by the best and brightest
cryptographers who have been hoodwinked far more
than dreamed of in earliest days of cypherpunks.
Still, there are die-hard PR-driven comsec experts
rolling out advice for what to do to protect the public --
meaning, cynically protecting their severely damaged
reputation of "concern for the public interest (R)".
Not yet willing to admit losing the comsec and privacy

NSA Technical Journal published "The Unbreakable Cipher" in Spring 1961.
David Kahn, "Lyen Otuu Wllwgh WI Etjown" pp. 71, 83, 84, 86,
88 and 90 of the New York Times Magazine November 13, 1960
says that an unbreakable cipher system can be made from one
time key "that is absolutely random and never repeats."  ...
For each cipher system there is an upper bound to the amount of
traffic it can protect against cryptanalytic attack. What is
"cryptanalytic attack"? It is a process applied to cipher text
in order to extract information, especially information
contained in the messages and intended to be kept secret.
If some of the information is gotten by other means and this
results in more being extracted from the cipher, this is (at
least partially) a successful attack. If certain phrases can be
recognized when they are present, this is successful cryptanalysis.
If a priori probabilities on possible contents are altered by
examination of the cipher, this is cryptanalytic progress.
If in making trial decipherments it is possible to pick out
the correct one then cryptanalysis is successful. ...
Another example is that of Mr. Kahn, one-time key. Here the
limit is quite clear; it is the amount of key on hand. The key arrives
in finite "messages," so there is only a finite amount on hand at
anyone time, and this limits the amount of traffic which can be sent
securely. Of course another shipment of key raises this bound, but
technically another cipher system is now in effect, for by my
definition a cipher system is a message. A sequence of messages

May it be true the spies admit defeat. But not likely, more likely

Pardons of Manning and Snowden, shutdown investigating
of Assange, and several other intimidating and chilling
operations would be persuasive. Hearings on abuse would
help air the stench. But will not eliminate the rot of secrecy.
These formulaic conciliatory gestures would be cheap discounts
of giant budgets for ancient practices of extorting money from
the public, for, what else, protection, protection against
government defined threats, identified by secret means.
The spying apparatus will re-surge as it has forever, governments
cannot survive without spying on its taxpayers. IRS and global
revenue agencies the main data collectors on citizens and subjects
from birth to death for everyone everywhere, even spies. SSN the
ubiquitous UID. Got a problem with that, go to jail. Tax refusers and
evaders more stigmatized and loathed than terrorists.
Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the world spend more time
chasing and prosecuting voluminous tax cheats then the tiny
number of terrorists. With their contractors this produces handsome
tax revenue, confiscations and fines. Prison populations too.
Spying was invented to catch tax cheats and assure revenue
for government operation and rule, and nothing unites the
world's governments more than that essential transfusion
of money to sustain government beneficiares, in the US the
three branches, state and local. Military merely cops to
control obedient payment.
In NYC, the racket of Wall Street is to pay NYPD to stay

with the gov, to toy with and tease the public by hoarding
documents, maintaining insider privileges of "journalists"
against outsiders, their readers, and experts who could
deconstruct the journo's pallid intepretation.
This is a game played also by secret-hoarding governments
against their citizens, aided and abetted by duplicitous
laws and lawyers.
MITM exploitation is what it is whatever they chose to call
their privilege protection racket.
And not to overlook the singular role of Tor in MITM
exploitation. The same distinctive rhetoic is deployed
by all of them to wave off suspicions as as if tradecraft.

      The Associated Press published in the
Spanish newspaper El Mundo document that displays the national security
of the U.S. spying on me more than 60 million phone calls in Spain in
just one month.
Report comes a week after Le Monde reported similar claims about U.S.

All these passionate reports refer to the hyped Der Spiegel
piece, slathered with additional hype, padded with dated filler,

The key document that has set techies pushing "credible
evidence" appears to be a two-page outline released by
Le Monde titled "Close Access Sigads" which lists a
batch of techie-like techniques used to intercept comms.
There has been discussion of these tricks around tech
circles due to the sparsity of technical information in most of
the Snowden releases in favor of generalities beloved
tech-illiterate journalists and their readers.
It is likely some techies fed tips and luridities to the German
spies (most of whom are also tech-illiterate and must rely
on tech-aware recruits and contractors who are treated
with disdain by old HUMINT-seasoned salts). Given a bit
of goose by the techie informants, the German spies saw
a great way to boost their tech budget, and leaped into action.
Same as in the US adminstration and Congress and their
kind around the world. Devilish comsec techies are nothing if not
opportunistic, MIT and Silicon Valley born and bred, and pray
nightly many Mannings and Snowdens will continue to valorize
their career of code and hack hoakum.

Since this issue has been raised for several years during which

through suspiciously popular commercial outlets, shortly to be

Don't be surpised if this billionaire also funds Internews. Along

Commercial and non-official exploitation of the comsec delusion

undergirding of official spying.
Privacy policies in particular were invented as a ruse to divert
attention from ubiquitous spying on the public by online services
whether of governmental, commercial, institutional, non-profit,

It is composed of two apparently identical facilities, mirror

There is a single conventional electrical sub-station for

one of them.
Nor is not known whether the power surges came from the
conventional electrical power system or the generators,

Perhaps both powered up briefly simultaneously, overloaded
surge protectors failed, excessive juice blasted the cables,
panels, processors. The relatively small dollar amounts
indicate that only some parts were affected.
An odd feature is the banana shape, with non-parallel

A useful invention, or discovery, similar to that of public key

that no communication, as we now know it, would actually occur.
Consider what ineffable thought led young Whit Diffie to imagine
PKC. He says it came to him at one point, not altogether believable
at first, thinking there must be a fault somewhere, if valid surely
it had been figured out before. As we know, it had been, by
the quiet Brits, and kept top secret.
What else like that is going on, has gone on, will gone on, all
the while evading classification at birth, not patented, not yet
institutionalized in secrecy madhouses hoarding the best and
brightest, as we know those terms of entrapment.
Consider that a non-communication ineffability has been invented,
or discovered, or is gestating in one or more young minds not
yet regimented by too much education, too much experience,
too much jaded skepticism, too little imagination, too much
comfort of reputation, salary, prizes and pensions, too much
blind faith in technology or mathematics, too much secrecy
as we know them to be crushing of novelty and waywardness.
For example, if the non-communication required no physical or
electromagnetic means but was based on say, conviction, or
concepts, or ideas, or imagination. The message would be
intuited, let us say, or grasped by deduction or induction, or
simply was shared without obvious effort except perhaps
an urge or yearning or desire or hunger or passion or insight,
or why not go for it, love.
Turns out this is not all that unusual. It is rather commonplace
if not ubiquitous. Animals do it, so do vegetables, and probably
minerals, though that is hard to say for sure, perhaps a volcanic
eruption or earthquake or asteroid is passing along content
as well as metadata.
Thought, perhaps faith, exchanges content by ineffability.
The arts, perhaps theoretical if not experimental science,
do too.

get cancer from a mutation of a symmetry group. But
Frenkel writes that math 'directs the flow of the universe.'
Its as elegant as music and as much a part of our
intellectual heritage as literature. He strives to awaken
our wonder by taking us on an equation-packed tour of
his research, in which he reveals a hidden world few
of us encountered in school."
Returning to Whit Diffie musing on what led to his discovery

be termed a hidden world of mathematics -- there may be
still hidden mathematical forms of communication that
does not rely upon technology's inevitable comsec failure.
The NSA global invasion appears almost wholly based on the
failure of technology rather than mathematics, as our esteemed

further invention appear driven by technology, code,

governments, nations, friends, lovers and citizens.
Not sure leaks, lawsuits and protests will deter this bounty of

to diminish Snowden's revelations with new forms of secrecy,
technology, law, regulations, bribery, lobbying, grants, contracts,
list lurking, online and offline spying, break-ins, the usual kaboodle,
to assure the NSA goals are fulfilled.

A characteristic of plants is that because they expect to
be eaten, they do not have vital organs, and regenerate
parts taken.
Thus, if a ciphersystem expected to be broken, it might
be able to mend the break, sacrifice parts to protect the
whole, without disclosing full content.
Surely there is a sytem that already does this. Multi-level
security may be close.
That a plant cannot move but depends upon absorbing
nutrients in its locale or delivered by movable actors --
insects, wind, rain, animals, other plant seeds -- might
also suggest a way to protect static machines and
Surely that is being done.
In both cases parts are sacrificed to movable actors who
are deluded to believe they rule over lesser beings which
they cannot understand.
So where are the eatable broken crypto which regenerates
itself without giving up full content, and networks which
are protected by use and traffic passing through? Tor might
be close to the latter for protecting content but the
hardware remains vulnerable.

Most NSA employees, like all spy agencies, do not participate
directly in special ops, any more than most military members
do not engage in combat. So they are terribly displeased when
the exposed war carnage breaks the bubble of prestige and
admiration bestowed on the whole clan for recruitment,
pensions, awards and ceremonial burial. NSA had a relatively
clean record, compared to other spies, until the fan was
hit with Snowden.
Snowden learned that working for a spy or military contractor
under guise of ennobling public service is a shock at how
badly hires and ex-officials are treated: produce and fulfill
new contracts damn quickly or get the fuck out. So he got

Which is why quite a few go back into official service after
a taste of raw capitalism always rotting. And, not least, why
even more adjust their ethics and morals to fit what the
corporations expect for predator-grade dollars a year.
Thus, millionaire Michael Hayden, who led the privatizing
initiative with a gang of venal directors and is reaping
payola for demonizing Snowden. And so is Alexander
preparing a place in that select TS/SCI Codeword crowd.
Infosec-comsec firms and experts play this duplicity game
exceedingly well, feet in both camps, hands in both pockets,
via dual-use tech and contracts, and it is to be expected that
evidence of that classified duplicity is being withheld by the
Snowden information managers, aided and abetted by those
very experts in lawful business corruption and deception,
protected by secrecy. Clues repeatedly proclaimed
by the press outlets: officials ask, demand, threaten,
don't publish names, addresses, emails, contractors'
names. Kiriakou and Hammond await you.
The sweet smell of success: joining the secretkeeping
crowd for future rewards by way of irresistable offers.
Guess how much will be offered to deliver Snowden and
his unpublished cache (if not Greenwald and Poitras too)
by one or more of his information fences by bribe and
threat? Sabu is ROTFLHAO, wearing a medal for taking

deeply involved in what some call "neurobiology" in which
brain-like activites are accomplished by vegetable swarms
of signals and networks without animal brains. Albeit root
stems searching for water and nutrients appear to behave
like brains below ground, while veggie sex occurs above
This raises the prospect of using plant capabilities in
emissions of chemicals and finding nutrients in signaling,
SIGINT, comsec, infosec and crypto.
Has anyone seen reports on this? Or on chemical transceiving

Brian Carroll rightly expands the discussion of pervasive targeting by

In architecture, for example, the increasing use of automation
for controlling building systems -- HVAC, electrical, plumbing,
security among others -- poses considerable vulnerabilities
beyond legacy analog controls. Many of the automated systems
are administered remotely over telephone, cable and
wireless networks. Others are controlled locally within
structures. Some are secured with encryption but many
are not. And few are TEMPEST-protected outside military
and governmental facilities.
We have found that few architects and building engineers are
knowledgeable about building automated systems nor the variety
of means to secure and protect them. They are customarily designed,
operated and maintained by specialty firms not traditional
building designers.
Moreover we have found that building management and
maintenance staff rely upon outside firms for advanced
technology, thus subjecting their facilties to unsupervised
interventions by outside personnel who may themselves
be sub-contractors, and sub-subs for each component
of automation.
In short, it is fairly easy to interdict and access building
automation systems for implanting devices, injecting
packets, tampering with OSes, siphoning networks,
temporarily suspending security, all the things recently
revealed in the 30c3 presentations.
Digital security and TSCM experts are familiar with many
of these vulnerabilities but there is a common practice
to specialize in services (often at client request) and
neglect comprehensive coverage. For example, to inspect
communications and security systems but not HVAC,
plumbing, electrical and automation systems which often
have far more inadvertent emitters and transceivers contained
in extensive components throughout a structure.
NSA TAO and the joint CIA-NSA Special Collection Service
are especially capable to expoit these gaps, and usually
send teams composed of experts in each building system
to determine a comprehensive attack on vulnerabilities,
and shrewdly, planting multiple and various decoys to
mislead counterspies.
A catalog of these full-scope operations would be quite

Logs needed run the Internet steadily, securely and cheaply
are not what logs files have grown into: Bloated, malicious,
exploitive and very lucrative spying on users. This is why there
are thousands of firms providing log files exploitation programs
and services. Every product manufacturer touts its spying
capabilities through innocent sounding "log files" ostensibly
serving administrative purpose but then just below that claim
are the burgeoning other uses of maximizing profits.
Log files are metadata of the Internet, the tip of a giant
iceberg of metadata. This is the dirty secret, the family
jewels, of the Internet, carefully rationalized and guarded
by sysadmins. Sysadmins have become the traitors, or
patriots, of the Internet. Traitors against the public, patriots
for the powerful exploiters of the Internet.

If your server or ISP generates log files, as all do, you cannot
be secure. If upstream servers generate log files, as all do,
you cannot be secure. If local, regional, national and international
servers generate log files, as all do, you cannot be secure.
So long as log files are ubiquitous on the Internet, no one can
be secure.
Log files are the fundamental weakness of the Internet
because system administrators claim the Internet cannot
be managed and maintained without them.
This is not true, it is merely an urban legend to conceal
the interests of system administrators and their customers
to exploit Internet user data.
There is no fundamental need for log files, except to
perpetuate the other urban legend, privacy policy, which
conceals the abuse of log files by web site operators
and their cooperation with "lawful" orders to reveal
user data, most often by being paid to reveal that
data to authorities, to sponsors, to funders, to
advertisers, to scholars, to private investigators,
to inside and outside lawyers, to serial cohorts,
cartels and combines, to providers and purchasers
of web sites, to educators of cyber employees,
to courts, to cybersecurity firms, to journalists, to
anybody who has the slightest justification to exploit
Internet freedom of information by way of phony
security, privacy and anonymizing schemes.
In this way, the Internet corrupts its advocates by

The relevant analogy is not that a dam might fail, but that the builders were paid ten million dollars to make sure it failed when the town's enemies wanted it to fail by planting dynamite in the dam.
This is not business as usual.  We will not continue in this path.  We will not continue to use dam builders who put dynamite in their dams.

would be constructive alternatives to "nothing can be done, authority always

of "unbreakable." Stop tinkering with old reliable OTP with digital

Civil engineers never say a dam is infallible, they say it will fail, watch

and never forget the disasters of over-confidence, limited construction
budgets, cut backs in maintenance, and water policy exploiters.
Earthen dams without sluices, relying upon mass and gravity, outlast

Prosecutors are highly adept at creating fear in supporters with
grand jury subpoenas for evidence and closed testimony, then
later subpoenaed for trial. This was done with several cypherpunks,
me among them.
During two trials and his imprisonment not a few cypherpunks
came down on Jim Bell, cowardly sorry motherfuckers, some
of them once admired for courage, shown to be candyasses
out to avoid risk beyond rhetoric (as with Manning and Snowden).
Not a few came down on Aaron Swarz, cowardly sorry motherfuckers,
some of them still lamenting the loss of a brave man while hiding
their abandonment of him, stigmatizing his loss of adorableness, his
loss of lovers, true friends and supporters, his lonely withdrawal from
social affairs, his hiding inside his apartment pondering the rest of
his life betrayed by those blaming him for their chickenshitedness.
Swartz died more likely murder, enforced suicide, a killing by
officials and those unable to match Aaron's bravery.
Jim Bell and Carl Johnson were not so easily buffaloed. Although
there continues to be bountiful cowardly motherfuckers who fucked
them as was Manning, as were the Anonymous 16, and will likely be
Snowden, led by the media which takes no chances beyond
rhetoric and hypebole.

Swartz was ratted by a sysadmin, investigated by several sysadmins,
some who formerly helped him and were pressured to betray him,
indicted with the essential help of sysadmins. University and JSTOR
administrators could not have discovered him , aided the investigation,
cooperated with the prosecutor, without sysadmins. The cops and

indicted and killed Swarz without sysadmins. Some of those sysadmins
are under lifetime vows of secrecy for cooperating against Swartz.

fora which avoid "politics" to simulate political involvement in order to
rat on the public, and each others, to maximize their income sysadmining
mercilessly, amorally, without ethics, without oversight, "out of control."
James Donald like others here is in a bind. He knows the villainy of
sysadmins and comsec experts, but needs the dirty money. So he
pretends to be hard-hearted. Forgive him succumbing to the power

Some cybertech wizards, sysadmins and comseckers, caught a wave
with cybersec. Trained themselves, got help from hackers and others,
got training at cybersec schools and gov agencies, got hired for
impressive pay, got awards for and against the public, gradually
became encrusted with cybersec layerings which involve a
witch's brew of deception, pretense, fear-mongering, half-assed
comsec, apologias, exculpations, blame-gaming, snot-nosed
arrogance, false modesty, lurking, put-downs, all the crafts of
sneak-thieves and politicians who loved their skullduggery.
Some are famous for the shit they spread. And rightly so, this
is the way of empires, now digital, now totally digitally spying,
now doing what empires do, calling their product what the

Assume this promotional creed screed for national security journalism:
No, media venality is not news. What is worth examining is the long-term
exploitation of "national security" as a joint gov-com-edu-org
racket to manipulate secretkeeping as a wealth concentration
industry. This has been commonplace since the national security
state was invented after WW2 and led to need for continuous
spying to manufacture enemies and to arm for diddly squat combat
against fictious foes by hugely expensive but hardly ever used
armaments. Cryptosystems among the black budgetary wastage.
In particular cryptosystem popularization (as here and its emulators)
as ostensible opposition to the national security racket, begun in the
flower-child 60s to flower wildly in the 90s and rise to a kudzu crescendo
with Snowden's operation to validate crypto use against illusory
enemies within the state, cloaked as usual by the blanket exculpt
"to do no harm to national security," then hide behind privileged
natsec journalism so dirty and complicit in govenment affairs it
needs protection from the public, so merely dribbles dainty
tidbits of threats to privacy and to advance the favorite ACLU
and EFF lawyerly fund-raising hobgobblin of constitutional
FISA Court jiggery-pokery by lawfare warriors indicates that
lawyers and judges know diddly about comsec technology
but dare not admit it and lose control of the public narrative
of threat and protection obligatory in the trillion dollar national
security hootenany which compares to organized religion of the
medieval era which ruled heaven and earth with fantasticly
frightening and pleasuring tales of evil and salvation.
Adled journalists are racing to adopt encryption as crusading
chain mail raiment, ignorant of how easily it can be penetrated,
but no matter, what will really protect the valiant journalists is
"constitutional protection," a comedy of conceit and stupidity

A point not well emphasized by cryptographers, in public at least,
and advocates of encryption as the essential requirement for
"Unbeakable crypto" may not be used as much as it once was
but there are a host of newly-minted versions of snake oilish
assurances dominating the booming comsec market, thanks
to Snowden's magnificent gift, estimated to eventually reach
the trillion dollar level in two decades, to the gov-com-edu-org
comsec panic industry.
Operators of systems, and the necessarily breachable security they
offer, remain the achilles heels of comsec. Lavabit is only one of
the instances in which sysadmins are compromised. Ubiquitous
deployment of crypto throughout telecom and cyber systems is
vulnerable to sysadmins who insist on full access to everything
to "de-bug" and run their systems, especially those SAs easily
manipulated by front offices and their ever so cooperative legal and
financial advisors. Not many SAs wil do what Snowden did in the
"public interest" which just happens to be a great fortune maker
for media and comsec hustlers.
End to end encryption is currently a hot recommendation of choice
for comsec but skips over what happens behind, below, around and
inside "end to end" code, hardware, implementation, and most of
all the traffic flow of the precious capsules emitting transceiver
vapor trails, EM clutter, arfully cloaked gaps, doors, handshakes,
implants, bugs (and "de-bugs"), ways in and out, checks, double
checks, safety plugs, sigs, nyms, language hints, and manifold
uniquenesses witting and unwitting of fallible hunks of meat.
It is, or should be, primary for cryptographers to publicly admit
cryptosystems inevitably fail, as some do despite being overridden
by sales and CEOs and investors, being bribed and NDA'd into
complicity, or in worst cases threatened with prosecution for
revealing in natsec systems built-in faults or more deviously,
pretending there are none while glossing deep deception with
shallow claims that there are always a few which can be repaired,
nothing is perfect, you get what you pay for, etc, etc, the
formulaic exculpation inherent in the word "security."
No question this is expecting cryptographers to be more honest
than the rest of the greedy "professional" class so avid to profess
public interest while gobbling the public's hard earned with gleeful
transgression slathered in "industry standards" and global treaties
to assure governments and corporations remain piggish and
dispensaries of rewards for the professional classes which
find oligarchal enticements "irresistable" as Greenwald slobbered
in agreeing to work closely with gov-com to withhold secrets
under guise of ventriloquizing Snowden's "causing no harm to
national security."
"Causing no harm to national security" is verily medieval in its
creed-promotional organized religion fervor. Cryptographers
have long been missionaries for this duplicitous "trust us" faith,
so it figures they will evangelize among journalists to adopt
encryption to upgrade the low value of the fear and trembling
scripture, and, as always, the compensation for scribes of
arcane holy writ of bare panic and crypto balm.

what is media hyperbole and what is worth worrying about and those

racketeering, crypto entrepreneurs of com, edu, org and
open source treacheries.
Recap: About 1,333 Snowden documents have been released by
commercial media, none for free.
Greenwald has said he gets about $1,500 per story in which he
gets a byline. Excluding the $1M signing bonus he has allegedly
got from Omidyar, he has made at least another million.
Gellman, Poitras perhaps the same (Poitras may have gotten a
similar signing bonus).
Other dozens of reporters were paid a percentage of that.
So it might be estimated the gang of reporters have garnered
some $4-5M so far.
Media outlets have probably earned 10 times that in sales and ads.
The USG, allies and enemies have probably received similar
amounts to respond to Snowden, some $50-100M.
So call it a $200-500M affair to date.
If the USG and other govs work the bonanza as predicted,
over 10-20 years the operation will generate, conservatively,
a $1-5T boost for comsec religionists and exploiters of media,
spies, universities, telcos, web operators, program peddlers,
AV magicians, games designers, not counting SM and SEOs
and spammers and botnets.
Black markets could match that amount, or multiples of it.
Meanwhile the comsec industry -- gov, mil, com, edu, org -- will
continue reaping the rewards of faith-based sin and salvation.
Thanks, Ed.

A point not well emphasized by cryptographers, in public at least,
and advocates of encryption as the essential requirement for
"Unbeakable crypto" may not be used as much as it once was
but there are a host of newly-minted versions of snake oilish
assurances dominating the booming comsec market, thanks
to Snowden's magnificent gift, estimated to eventually reach
the trillion dollar level in two decades, to the gov-com-edu-org
comsec panic industry.
Operators of systems, and the necessarily breachable security they
offer, remain the achilles heels of comsec. Lavabit is only one of
the instances in which sysadmins are compromised. Ubiquitous
deployment of crypto throughout telecom and cyber systems is
vulnerable to sysadmins who insist on full access to everything
to "de-bug" and run their systems, especially those SAs easily
manipulated by front offices and their ever so cooperative legal and
financial advisors. Not many SAs wil do what Snowden did in the
"public interest" which just happens to be a great fortune maker
for media and comsec hustlers.
End to end encryption is currently a hot recommendation of choice
for comsec but skips over what happens behind, below, around and
inside "end to end" code, hardware, implementation, and most of
all the traffic flow of the precious capsules emitting transceiver
vapor trails, EM clutter, arfully cloaked gaps, doors, handshakes,
implants, bugs (and "de-bugs"), ways in and out, checks, double
checks, safety plugs, sigs, nyms, language hints, and manifold
uniquenesses witting and unwitting of fallible hunks of meat.
It is, or should be, primary for cryptographers to publicly admit
cryptosystems inevitably fail, as some do despite being overridden
by sales and CEOs and investors, being bribed and NDA'd into
complicity, or in worst cases threatened with prosecution for
revealing in natsec systems built-in faults or more deviously,
pretending there are none while glossing deep deception with
shallow claims that there are always a few which can be repaired,
nothing is perfect, you get what you pay for, etc, etc, the
formulaic exculpation inherent in the word "security."
No question this is expecting cryptographers to be more honest
than the rest of the greedy "professional" class so avid to profess
public interest while gobbling the public's hard earned with gleeful
transgression slathered in "industry standards" and global treaties
to assure governments and corporations remain piggish and
dispensaries of rewards for the professional classes which
find oligarchal enticements "irresistable" as Greenwald slobbered
in agreeing to work closely with gov-com to withhold secrets
under guise of ventriloquizing Snowden's "causing no harm to
national security."
"Causing no harm to national security" is verily medieval in its
creed-promotional organized religion fervor. Cryptographers
have long been missionaries for this duplicitous "trust us" faith,
so it figures they will evangelize among journalists to adopt
encryption to upgrade the low value of the fear and trembling
scripture, and, as always, the compensation for scribes of
arcane holy writ of bare panic and crypto balm.

Assume this promotional creed screed for national security journalism:
No, media venality is not news. What is worth examining is the long-term
exploitation of "national security" as a joint gov-com-edu-org
racket to manipulate secretkeeping as a wealth concentration
industry. This has been commonplace since the national security
state was invented after WW2 and led to need for continuous
spying to manufacture enemies and to arm for diddly squat combat
against fictious foes by hugely expensive but hardly ever used
armaments. Cryptosystems among the black budgetary wastage.
In particular cryptosystem popularization (as here and its emulators)
as ostensible opposition to the national security racket, begun in the
flower-child 60s to flower wildly in the 90s and rise to a kudzu crescendo
with Snowden's operation to validate crypto use against illusory
enemies within the state, cloaked as usual by the blanket exculpt
"to do no harm to national security," then hide behind privileged
natsec journalism so dirty and complicit in govenment affairs it
needs protection from the public, so merely dribbles dainty
tidbits of threats to privacy and to advance the favorite ACLU
and EFF lawyerly fund-raising hobgobblin of constitutional
FISA Court jiggery-pokery by lawfare warriors indicates that
lawyers and judges know diddly about comsec technology
but dare not admit it and lose control of the public narrative
of threat and protection obligatory in the trillion dollar national
security hootenany which compares to organized religion of the
medieval era which ruled heaven and earth with fantasticly
frightening and pleasuring tales of evil and salvation.
Adled journalists are racing to adopt encryption as crusading
chain mail raiment, ignorant of how easily it can be penetrated,
but no matter, what will really protect the valiant journalists is
"constitutional protection," a comedy of conceit and stupidity
usually associated with court jesters.

Sys admins catch you hunting them and arrange compromises
to fit your demands so you can crow about how skilled you are.
Then you hire them after being duped as you duped to be hired.
The lead Tor designer reportedly (via Washington Post) had a
session with NSA to brief on how to compromise it, although
"compromise" was not used nor is the word used by
Not many honest comsec wizards nowadays are promising
more than compromised comsec, and the compromise is gradually
increasing as Snowden material is dribbled out to convince the
public and wizards not a hell of a lot can be done about it except
believe in and buy more compromised comsec.
Not news here and in comsec wizard-land, to be sure, but
compromised comsec is the industry standard, as the industry
and its wizards in and out of government enjoy the boom and
bust in comsec tools generated by precursors of Snowden,
Snowden and his successors.
Compromisability is assumed by the comsec industry to be a
fundamental feature in all nations, no need to advertise it, much
better to advertise how great comsec is and now much it is
needed. Crypto-wizards have a long history of compromising
believers who hire them and who suffer their promises of
highly trusted protection.
Trusted comsec is necessary to get persons to pack their

Sys admins catch you hunting them and arrange compromises
to fit your demands so you can crow about how skilled you are.
Then you hire them after being duped as you duped to be hired.
The lead Tor designer reportedly (via Washington Post) had a
session with NSA to brief on how to compromise it, although
"compromise" was not used nor is the word used by
Not many honest comsec wizards nowadays are promising
more than compromised comsec, and the compromise is gradually
increasing as Snowden material is dribbled out to convince the
public and wizards not a hell of a lot can be done about it except
believe in and buy more compromised comsec.
Not news here and in comsec wizard-land, to be sure, but
compromised comsec is the industry standard, as the industry
and its wizards in and out of government enjoy the boom and
bust in comsec tools generated by precursors of Snowden,
Snowden and his successors.
Compromisability is assumed by the comsec industry to be a
fundamental feature in all nations, no need to advertise it, much
better to advertise how great comsec is and now much it is
needed. Crypto-wizards have a long history of compromising
believers who hire them and who suffer their promises of
highly trusted protection.
Trusted comsec is necessary to get persons to pack their
comms with compromisable information. The greater the
trust the greater the revelations of just what is desired.
So what if laws are aleays jiggered to allow access to the

Cyber attacks continue to dominate the headlines, and with good reason. While the threat of cyber security is often exaggerated, there is no doubt that the enhanced networking of society has created substantial vulnerabilities lurking within its interconnected pathways. With attackers able to strike from anywhere and inflict damage on a significant (but often unnoticed) scale, the threat has never been greater to the reams of knowledge held by governments and enterprise. There is also the threat to military information sharing networks representing a significant challenge: in an era of increased integration between systems and platforms, the very webs which act as force multipliers could collapse. Efforts to counter these extensive vulnerabilities are presently ongoing to an impressive degree, and the speed of these developments is not expected to lessen unduly.

In connection with using "encrypted, secure connection" Skype for
Snowden's imagery at SXSW and TED, as well as encrypted comms
with journalists and event organizers, what has led these comsec
advisors to believe that all too vulnerable Skype is secure, as well
as all too vulnerable popular crypto pushed for journalists?
Is there any indication Snowden has deployed less vulnerable
protections which have not been disclosed as backing for his
encouragement to trust encryption and to allow Skype to
finger his location and leak his comms?
To be sure, many of his remarks seem to be carefully scripted
for low-brow consumption characteristic of journalism. So there
may be a secure back-channel being used with Skype and pop
crypto as diversion.
The low-brow slides, clips, short docs, redactions released by the
media point to a deception of some sort yet to be disclosed until
25 years has passed. Hyperventilating press accounts of the
releases suggest either deception, inexperience or technical
ignorance or all.
Still, that kind of misleading comsec deception would be commonplace
security measures characterisitic of NSA and wizards -- to induce the
flock to churn massive amount publicity about encrypted comms --
and Skype -- to camouflage the Tor, blacker and deeper comms,
not to say the even blacker and deeper tools not seen by Snowden
or not yet released.
More sopisticated would be to use the small amount of NSA releases
to cloak far greater distribution (a method used by WikiLeaks and
the black market as well as the spy industry). That too would closer
to what the big boys and girls do, and therefore would be exactly what
they are watching for. Including watching for ploys to hide ploys.

The CIA is the principal customer of NSA products outside
the military. When global cyber spying Cybercom was proposed
NSA did not want to do it, claiming it exceeded NSA's military
mission. However, the pols, and CIA, wanted that very excess,
in particular for spying inside the US, ostensibly banned for the
CIA but now needed for terrorists inside.
CIA (long FBI opponents) thought FBI could not cope with inside
terrorists, using 9/11 as an example, and advocated NSA involvement
with its much greater technical capability, but more importantly, its
military-privileged secrecy not susceptible to full congressional
oversight, courts and FOIA.
The joint CIA-NSA Special Collection Service (SCS) has
been doing for decades what NSA is now alone accused of doing:
CIA provided the targets, NSA did the technical collection from
those global stations identified by xKeyscore (most in embassies
or nearby).
What is bizarre is how little CIA is mentioned in news furor about
NSA, as if NSA did its work in isolation from the IC and without
oversight of the 3 branches.
SCS also does burglaries, code snatches, decrypts, doc drops,
stings, ploys, blackmail, the panoply of CIA operations. The increased
civilian target panoply bestowed upon NSA came from CIA demands
channeled through ODNI.
Reviewing what little has been released of the Snowden documents
they are quite similar to what SCS has been doing with the addition
of the US as target. FISA had to be rejiggered for the US domain.
Most national leaders, like POTUS, are considered to be military
commanders thus fair game for NSA along with CIA. Nothing
exceptional about the recent revelations of spying on chiefs of
NSA technical collection capability was developed for the
military, not civilian use. Now expanded to CIA full dominance
territory. FISA had to be rejiggered for using it against civilians.
And is still being rejiggered these days.
NSA's recent attempt to slough off Cybercom and return to

following CIA guidance and fear-mongering of civilians, especially
those inside the US. The last thing CIA and its supporters want

Great that Snowden is getting another chance to speak for himself,
as available on an awfully restricted technical tube-like forum -- so
far only talking head shots at the venues where he has been beamed
in from who knows where, scripted by who knows who from his burgeoning
team of handlers, now joined by EU polopportunists.
It would be even greater if if Snowden himself released or at least
displayed documents beside his head or encouraged the withholders
to do so as the surcharge for their exclusive rigging of ever fewer releases.
Head shotting and paneling by and about Snowden seems to have
substituted for release of documents needed for us to reach our own
conclusions. Entertainment over information.
Oh well, that condescension is how media, politicians and governments
manipulate us ignorant consumers of produce.
Thanks for keeping us alert to EU produce.

Indeed, this exculpation is taught in the drone operation schools,

arm. Dan is one of the smartest and most prescient thinkers in the
security world, who has made headlines by warning about the dangers
of our reliance of technology monocultures like Microsoft's Windows
operating systems. Most recently, Dan has been sounding similar alarms
about an (emerging) monoculture of "small devices and the chips that run
them." In other words: just because the network of the future doesn't
have a Windows sticker and "Intel Inside" logo on it, doesn't mean that
the same kinds of problems don't exist.
Many of you who have been following this blog know that the Security
Ledger is particularly interested in covering the (fast) evolving border
line between "traditional" IT security and the terra incognito of the
Internet of Things.
This week, we're taking that discussion to the next level with our
first-ever event: The Security of Things Forum (or SECoT for short).
SECoT is going to be an amazing day of discussion and debate about
what I consider one of the foremost challenges facing the

Not only the cyber titans were treated to classified briefings
by NSA but also journalists, a number of them since the Snowden
releases, continuing a long tradition of cultivating amplifiers
and opiners in just about all fields -- com, edu, org, experts,
in particular those in infosec, comsec, netsec and data
And like the titans, the others assure their customers nothing
like that is going on, abiding non-disclosure pacts obligatory
for classified entry to secretkeeping. Dual-hats for dual-usage.
And not a few of these are rewarded not merely with information
but contracts, fees, endorsements, featured product placements
in spy offerings, awards (open and secret), vouchings in setting
of standards, educational scholarships for expert profs students
and research assistants, consultancies, recommendations to
corporations and foreign customers.
What is wondrous about the Snowden releases is that there
is so little about this far broader constituencies which conspire
with spies, invent and promote spy products and services, with
the easy corporate targets serving as camouflage for the ostensibly
good hearts who avow they are on the side of the public.
A distinctive feature of this charade is inveterate lying, as spies
do with pride and vainglory, as security pros must do or die,
threatended to be killed for telling just half of the whole story
as ex-spies do to save their skin.
Whadda you mean, the whole story, are you nuts? The whole
story is beyond belief, beyond revelation, nobody knows it.
It is postulated to make the partial revelations look like a clue
to much worse, a standard spy, ethics, education, religion
business, government means and methods, which happens
to be in effect for Snowden, as with other spies and exes,
titans and journalists, scholars and hackers.

how many previous defendants have succumbed to the
reality of defiance, its impact on family, friends and career.
Then show documents on the sentencing and jailing of

Not likely you will see the list if it exists. Magical lists are as

conceal our paltry lies with tax-advisories which covertly supply our

global catchall far more capacious than Utah Data Center, feared
as much by individual spies as other panopticked extortion
victims. This sidebar to remind NSA secrecy is hardly the great
threat to "personally identifiable information" (PII).
There is a practice of government agencies and some others
to not publish (PII) of individuals. So email addresses, homes,
phone and SSNs are usually redacted. Except when used
to coerce obedience, inform on targets, shame in public.
The Washington Post said it searched 200,000 pages of
Snowden material in search of a bit of data which it reported.
Why brag of the number? That's hyperbole. This number of
pages seems to be far more than the 59,000 or so files asserted
by The Guardian, but that is unclear due the lack of number of
pages in the 59,000 "files" or "documents." We have tallied a
few under 3,000 pages released by the various Snowden outlets.
Promis is a controversial program and is slathered with myths
and disinfo, as camouflage and propaganda for and against
its use and capabilities, as customary for villainous operations.
There is a continuing lucrative industry to chill democratic
transparency with layers of braggadacio, denial, lying and
pretense of threat and counterthreat. Uncertainty about who
is spying on you is the purpose, and to stigmatize you if you
inquire too persistently. Out comes the bellows of "conspiracy
theory," "tin-hats," paranoids, weirdos and such.
Public deception is a perdurable feature of spying and power
concentration. Shallow layers of expose, fed to media with
the understanding it will flatter itself by behaving "responsibly"
in order to assure future feedings, is part of that. That is
part of the Snowden methodology and is a highly favored
journalistic practice to melodramatically claim to know more
than can be revealed while exaggerating the courage to reveal
what it does while protecting the public interest (thus emulating
government and other authoritarian practice).
Reviews of Citizenfour are cautious, not sure what to make
of the careful editing and omissions. They sense, and say
so, there is much still missing. Poitras is saying just that:
this is "not the full story" by "any stretch of the imagination."
This is a Hollywood technique likely imposed on her by
the film's backers. Which will economically segue nicely
into the Oliver Stone's and whatitsname's makeover

that full access has been granted in confidence to skilled

all the rest is simple-minded promotional material with

are offering to encrypt for those who do not want install programs
or find them too difficult to use. All appear to promise that no

will be kept. Trust them.
For example, here's one used to send encrypted messages:
This approach suggests that the renewed crypto wars have again
bred a new round of opportunities to beguile those who yearn for
comsec but do not know how to get it, nor how to evaluate the
offerings, in particular those provided by US producers which they
doubt are free of government manipulation. But they also doubt that
any cryptosystem is free of that, thanks to the NSA revelations of
global cooperation among nations to do what NSA does, and the
failure of crypto experts and firms to fully disclose their aid to
governments, before and after Snowden's revelations.
So the downside of Snowden's revelations is that there is considerable
suspicion that all crypto is compromised, and, worse, that snake oil
is not really different from the good stuff for the ordinary user who lacks
the technical skills to distinguish them. And that comsec experts are
in league with authorities to dupe the public by excessive warning
of snake oil to peddle their own offerings, that is, experts and

The Amsterdam Media Professor Geert Lovink left no doubt that in his opinion the medium term, the entire treasure of the NSA Whistleblowers must be made and archived publicly. Such an approach has a very different range than the global 24-hour news machine. "Journalists want to make headlines and politics", was the founder of the Institute of Network Cultures . But it was important to think long-term.
The Snowden-papers offer unique insight into a loud Lovink "information-military complex in the making": They showed roughly, "who are the actors and what technologies they use." In addition, they made different impact of monitoring on individual countries or regions significantly and who personally was affected as a group or society. Taken together, this was "for all investigative journalists around the world for decades interesting".
Ruf nach Veröffentlichung der Snowden-Papiere wird lauter
Der Amsterdamer Medienprofessor Geert Lovink ließ keinen Zweifel daran, dass seiner Meinung nach mittelfristig der gesamte Schatz des NSA-Whistleblowers öffentlich gemacht und archiviert werden müsse. Eine solche Herangehensweise habe eine ganz andere Reichweite als die globale 24-Stunden-Nachrichtenmaschinerie. "Journalisten wollen Schlagzeilen und Politik machen", befand der Gründer des Institute of Network Cultures. Es gelte aber, langfristiger zu denken.
Die Snowden-Papiere bieten laut Lovink einzigartige Einsicht in einen "informations-militärischen Komplex im Werden": Sie zeigten etwa auf, "wer die Akteure sind und welche Technologien sie nutzen". Darüber hinaus machten sie unterschiedliche Auswirkungen der Überwachung auf einzelne Länder oder Regionen deutlich und wer persönlich, als Gruppe oder Gesellschaft betroffen sei. Zusammengenommen sei dies "für alle investigativen Journalisten weltweit über Jahrzehnte hinweg interessant".

The global internal rot of digital technology dependence appears doing
quite well by inducing ever greater investment and reliance upon
it. Will over-reliance upon secret cryptography be its Achilles heel?
Let us hope so.
Conumdrum is that wholesale monitoring is the result of ubiquitous
digital technology, networks and programs thickly hidden by secret
cryptography, thinly protected, if at all, by never quite effective public
cryptography, ineffective by law by design, by implementation and
by endless excuses to do better next time.
The correlation between the rise of the Internet to advance global
surveillance and public cryptography to persuade the populace there
is hope the surveillance can be countered, is occasionally noted
but not by cryptography fetishists who promote the notion it is possible
to have a global platform of diverse levels for multiple open and
secret uses but still protect at least a few of the levels with encryption.
This despite the legacy of cryptography as a deceptive technology
through and through and foremost, in particular by misleading about
its strengths and weaknesses, its treachery and double-dealing, its
cheating and betraying, its false promises and "confessed" failures.
No doubt all forms of security share these characteristics, eventual
failure is the fundamental outcome of a security system subject to
ceaseless attack. Every fortress fails, every weapon is surpassed,
every peace treaty is transgressed, every ideology collapses, every
nation is overturned; in all cases by excessive conviction that failure
will not happen, and when it does, it occurs by the least expected
means. After a few attempts to repair the majestic defense and
prolong a regime, it finally implodes most often due to internal
rot of those unable to give up comfortable convictions that munitions
are invulnerable, that supreme command and control is protected
against tampering, that oaths and rewards of fealty to the homeland
are insurpassable. Except for the planted cheats of anonymizers
and encryption.

@_subject: Privacy has always been a fight against rulers and funders 
Verifying US-UK concordance, with FBI head, Director of NSA said
much the same as GCHQ to the US Chamber of Commerce on
October 28, 2014:
These heads of spy and LE agencies are proposing that companies
and citizens continue to serve and become spies, agents, informers,
coverts in mirroring their enemies of their security states. And not only
are asking for patriotic volunteers by sticks of fear and aiding
the enemy but contracting for services by carrots of privileged
briefings, access, profits and tax write-offs. No wonder oligarchs
are increasing and are rushing to aid and abet spies in all
Will First Look's Racket magazine come to life to join
The Intercept, so buzzworthily named to fit what they
do: front for First Look Media's invention and distribution
of comsec products which if true to the ancients' practice
will spy on the populace with everylasting panoptic look.
This is hardly new, indeed is as old as governments and their
precursor "lawful" rulers of the populace which cannot be
trusted with anarchic self-rule, much less armed with treasonous
cryptoanarchy for absolute right to privacy from rulers.
Even this list of rogues was founded and struggles to survive on
its impossible mission to resist this ancient history and current
fervor of duplicity and dual-use of the ever growing family of
securities -- personal, home, clan, region, nation, global,
religion, ideology -- deployed to simultaneously attack and
protect the populace by declaring who is insider and who
is outsider, take your pick, save your life. Us or them. Divide
and conquer. Praise and smear. Lop heads and drone. Imprison
and exile.
Significantly for this clan, comsec remains an essential tool
for attacking and protecting. It annoys the masters of comsec
no end for rogues to mess with their command and control
communications and ubiquitous civic spying operations.
It requires recruitment of comsec rogues to mess with rogues,
as amply demonstrated here and other security fora where
coders and hackers are prime candidates for quietly switching
sides, remaining in place, covertly informing, sabotaging,
implanting, faulting, I/O erroring, pretending opposition to the
state, stashing their fees, teaching cryptology, advising NGOs,
counseling dissidents, whistling Dixie for media and audiences,
advocating openness, disclosing shallow vulns to hide
the deeper.
This list goes on, as evidenced here and on the gobs of
freedom of information outlets which have spread as widely
as the Internet, black net, deep net, chats, OTRs, Tor, and
now cellphone webs and swarms of earnest instigators
indistinguishable from TLAs taking 100% and giving back
at best 50%, with bountiful support from freedom-loving
oligarchs, soliciting volunteers, paying overseers of
volunteers, accruing profits by shifting taxation to the
populace for their protection and spying on it to assure
system security, oiled with bounties, bonuses and
Sabu-grade walk-frees awards for whistleblowing on the
whistleblowing, and not least, enduring legal fees for ACLU-
grade justice tipped against oppostion to civil liberties
racketeering aided and abetted by backdoored comsec
also known as rule of law.

Reader asks: What Is Good Encryption Software?
I have contacted you asking about certain security questions.
After reading a few of the Snowden leaked documents, I have
started to be more aware of my privacy being at risk. I have a
few questions concerning certain programs and safety tips.
First, I've recently started to doubt about my encryption software.
Is Symantec's "PGP Endpoint" a good hard drive encryption software?
In other words, is it trustworthy since it is an American company.
And if not, what encryption software is the best for Mac.
Second, is "ProtonMail" as secure as they say it is? If not, what
email provider doesen't let the NSA see into my account.
Third, is Jetico inc's "Bestcrypt Container Encryption" trustworthy?
If not, what could be an alternative.
Fourth, are these encryption types good? Blowfish, Gost & AES - 256bit.
And which encryption type remains the best above all?
Last, is Kaspersky a good anti-virus software? If not, which one is the
best for Mac.
Important, difficult questions, likely to produce a range of answers.
We will publish for answers.

these lists to be used for soliciting befuddled consumers to hop aboard

Still, Cryptome endorses the continuing struggle to improve citizen
protection, not only as a job, career, industry, but as citizens' obligation
to bear responsibility for the commonweal against its inside and outside
enemies, if you will, common math against the deadly germs.
One way to do that is to not oversell it, tone down the threats, reduce
drumbeating, avoid hyperbole for and against, forego advertising,
gang-bang hectoring, circle jerk conferencing, TEDing, prize bestowing,
to quietly invent, improve, critique, test, apply, re-test often, expect to

From discussion on these lists and elsewhere tampering with
data can, does, occur at every software and hardware hand-off,
with each self-serving iteration having hidden and vulnerable hardware
and software undisclosed malignity, no matter the security ostentatiously
applied: reputation, credibility, impeccability, highly trusted, crypto,
hashes, fail by ruses of unexamined modules and inevitable, unavoidable
deceptions of too little skill, too little time, too little suspicion, driven by
need to pay alimony, debts, IRS, loutish family's begging.
Selected hand-offs of innumerable:
Multiple devious inventors, manufacturers and handlers inside and outside NSA
Devious NSA leaking like a sieve to madly grabbing everything devious Snowden
Snowden madly shoveling everything to multiple exceptionally devious media persons
Multiple media persons to hyper devious lawyers, publishing staff, tech experts, govs consulted
Devious selections of data to publish, then revised, then corrected
DEvious posting on outlet web sites and shoveling to cohort journos
Devious "authenticating" of docs (the prime deception)
Deviously orchestrated subsequently:
Downloads of docs
Sharing of docs
Archiving of docs
Dropboxing, torrenting of docs
Biased analysis and cherrypicking of docs
Multiple tagging and piggybacking and implanting of docs
Shading, smearing, vaunting, lying about docs
Accusing and defending about docs
Writing, lecturing, TEDing about docs
Dismissing of docs, the threat, the countermeasures
Then deviously shipping, shopping fools to take blame
by signature-bold leaders of pro and con opportunities
or to a prize ceremony for valorizing the criminal prize-funder
and bestowing generous tax avoidances.
These vulns and subterfuges and braggardies are as old as
comsec, hyperbolized by the digital era for rep building,
monetizing, and political ideology. These lists survive on
ingesting these toxic fumes and expel multiple recyclings
of them for jingle-jangle of gullible consumers, here as in

From discussion on these lists and elsewhere tampering with
data can, does, occur at every software and hardware hand-off,
with each self-serving iteration having hidden and vulnerable hardware
and software undisclosed malignity, no matter the security ostentatiously
applied: reputation, credibility, impeccability, highly trusted, crypto,
hashes, fail by ruses of unexamined modules and inevitable, unavoidable
deceptions of too little skill, too little time, too little suspicion, driven by
need to pay alimony, debts, IRS, loutish family's begging.
Selected hand-offs of innumerable:
Multiple devious inventors, manufacturers and handlers inside and outside NSA
Devious NSA leaking like a sieve to madly grabbing everything devious Snowden
Snowden madly shoveling everything to multiple exceptionally devious media persons
Multiple media persons to hyper devious lawyers, publishing staff, tech experts, govs consulted
Devious selections of data to publish, then revised, then corrected
DEvious posting on outlet web sites and shoveling to cohort journos
Devious "authenticating" of docs (the prime deception)
Deviously orchestrated subsequently:
Downloads of docs
Sharing of docs
Archiving of docs
Dropboxing, torrenting of docs
Biased analysis and cherrypicking of docs
Multiple tagging and piggybacking and implanting of docs
Shading, smearing, vaunting, lying about docs
Accusing and defending about docs
Writing, lecturing, TEDing about docs
Dismissing of docs, the threat, the countermeasures
Then deviously shipping, shopping fools to take blame
by signature-bold leaders of pro and con opportunities
or to a prize ceremony for valorizing the criminal prize-funder
and bestowing generous tax avoidances.
These vulns and subterfuges and braggardies are as old as
comsec, hyperbolized by the digital era for rep building,
monetizing, and political ideology. These lists survive on
ingesting these toxic fumes and expel multiple recyclings
of them for jingle-jangle of gullible consumers, here as in
in the spy agencies working the yokels.
"NSA" or some monstrous threat -- God, Google, Cisco, MS --
is inside our skulls and peripherals, left brain in mortal combat
with the right brain, digital vs analog. Or so we imagine the two

Meanwhile, replacment spy tools are being developed in order that Snowden's gift can

It is virtually impossible to sanitize PDFs due to Adobe's inherent

meta is used to hide inaccessible. Below dark is darker, ever
darkening as new tools are developed to pry farther into the

Counter-Countermeasures (including cyberweapons like PDFs).

material in all its iterations from the time he snatched it to
the latest distributor, consumer and secret archiver in Oahu,
Maryland, Hong Kong, Berlin, Rio, NYC, DC, online and off.
PDFs (and DOCs) are more treacherous than log files, backdoors,
0-days, APTs, what have you due to their popularity. HTM and TXT
are much safer. Courier fonts are safer than other fonts, especially

"Dave DeWalt, CEO of security firm Mandiant, a participant in

This is the first that I've ever heard of a tradeoff between privacy and

Disks or any electro-mechanical device, may not be the only, or

the data to be in active memory all the time. Arrayed, large CPU-like
"chips" or solid state (best is unsolid state) processors make data
constantly usable, always up to date, no lag time, no wear and tear.
Physical disks use too much energy and require too much architecture
to rack, interconnect, house, energize, maintain, repair, replace, update.
And are way too slow and clunky.
However, this doesn't mean Utah Data Center is not useful as a

identified in the organics table.
X-Ray physics and detector materials need research, 1890s through
1970s was a huge ammount of X-Ray publicity, but NEVER EVER DID ANYONE
USE IT FOR SIGNALING??? BULLSHIT!
"is there any distinction at military bases or secure areas?" YES.
there is some access control doors which others suggest is a standard
card reader with number pad and automatic door that is common on the
secure layer of military and COMMERCIAL CONTRACTOR facilities that has
a proximity detector signal built into the door frame. THE COIN DATA
WARPS AROUND THIS CYLINDRICAL SIGNAL ON THE DOOR PORTAL AND VECTOR
PASSES THROUGH THE WALL. Obviously the vector is impossible without
fields projected from that security device! There is also a ghosting
signature that reduces sample rate (in the digitiser) around similar
facilities, looks like it was isolated in the newer signal index, so
it should be really obvious who is using these jamming systems and
where! (and where else!)
more questions:
coins on boats? yes.
coins on submarines? YES. (with ghosting)
organic signals? wtf?
Yes, but im told the prior emailed reference is erroneous: the primary
index is a SIGNALS CHARACTERISTIC tree, the supporting block (large
bit scope number) is VERY SIMILAR to a genetic expression profile tree
such as genome.gov/ and many of the gene profiling standards.
Hopefully the news will start posting the technical reports the
primary groups have been preparing last few days... we need to get
physics and advanced crypto groups attention, if the signals are
encoded and that party broke through dense analogue crypto, it will
take a huge effort to solve for that (it may have been an analogue EM
field as well that performed the encoding or reference signals) to
make the same capability posible for others.

The most poignant moment in the book comes when Popper contrasts a conference for the more ideologically minded Bitcoiners at a racetrack on the outskirts of Austin, where Ulbricht grew up, with the gathering of the rich and powerful at the South by Southwest festival, where Ulbrichts mother is politely dismissed as she pleads for funds to help defray her sons legal costs. It was an unhappy reminder of a side of Bitcoin that its new adherents wanted to put behind them, Popper writes. And as he notes, If this was the new world, it didnt seem all that different from the old one ­ at least not yet.
Nor can Digital Gold be a tale with a satisfying ending, because the future of Bitcoin is unknowable right now. As the venture capitalist Barry Silbert says at a Goldman Sachs conference, Bitcoin is either going to change everything, or nothing. But if Bitcoin doesnt change every­thing, people will keep trying to find something that will, and so Poppers book stands as necessary reading, and very intriguing at that, regardless of the eventual fate of his subject.

The NYT-Propublica is an informative and impressive release,
in many ways better than previous. It expands on the earlier

in gaps. A good sign the holders of the balance of the Snowden
dump are digging deeper and learning how convey a fuller picture

twiddle thumbs awaiting useful data to devise defenses. (A hint
from some Snowden withholders there may be handoffs to
technologists separate from the public. Schneier, Matthew
Green, a few other comsec wizards aiding publishers have
said as much.)
Hardly complete to be sure, with about 10% of the dump
published, with plenty of gaps indicated by jumps in narratives
and still too many redactions -- presumably the result of
consulting with officials as heretofore disclosed, or due to
Snowen's instructions about what to withhold, either to
"avoid national security harm" or in expectation US prosecutors

It might be surmised that staying away from technology

and comprehensiveness of slides and text serves to
warn the enemy of what's in store without disclosing

In particular, Snowden's and associates harping on the

Well said on skepticism of news reports concerning crypto, comsec,
infosec, natsec. Disinfo and deception are inherent in security and
survival, and best, most reliable, most trusted are typical tools of
misleading exploitation.
Where a single means and method, such as crypto (or science), is
encouraged for rock-solid assurance, at least one other means and
methods should be employed which in no way depends upon the
single means. Hoodwink wins by cheating.
A single means is certain to be continously under attack, and its
vulnerabilities concealed both by the attackers and by the promoters.
Blind faith in a single means is as old as religion, art and royalty, perhaps
as old as humans faced with unending threats from nature and

Correct analysis. First was get out a prompt notice to wave off users,
then proceed with other authentications. Toughest problem is how to
avoid another compromise of new keys since so many ways to do
that have arisen and/or suspected over the life of PGP and other
systems. WoT is problematic too, as are key signing parties, and
so on. Other systems claim to be better, and we are using some of
them, waiting and watching and suspecting are the lessons learned

We likely would not have discovered the compromises if not for

Cryptome's offer to sell itself and logs for the amount Omidyar
is tax writing off  at The Intercept, and skying the donation for its archive
to the weekly stipend of top Snowden exploiters, is a parody of
what highly-profitable web sites like e-Bay, ISPs, equipment, program
and cybersecurity peddlers, and net operators and overseers are doing.
Access, traffic and transaction logs are ginned, sorted, stored, munged,
manipulated, sold, stolen, and more, all along the many packeting, hops,
boosts, diversions, conversions, hand-offs to various devices of the route
from user to destination. End point of user and the destination is merely
one bit of data, well, two bits, with gobs of bits quietly being gobbled
elsewhere, camouflaged by the delusion of privacy policies, anonymization,
and website log deletion or never ginning logs.
Cryptome has no logs, never has. Its various ISPs have copious logs of
many kinds (not just the simplistic access logs meant to delude website
operators), along with all the other transceivers of visitor activities and
transaction metadata and metametadata.
Cryptome has never run a server, just buy the service. We do track our
ISPs' activities and through them the ganglia of the Internet to see what
happens to our files.
Voracious bots have always been the heaviest users of Cryptome, siphoning
files hourly, daily, monthly, then providing them to users at other locations
to gin their own families of data for sale to govs, coms, edus, banks,
investigators, investors.
Google, Bing, Internet Archive, Torrent, drops, govs, spies, academics,
researchers, cyberseckers, take, steal actually (as do we), Internet files
for their own use which is primarily to gather data on users, the precious
jewels of the Internet which underwrite its so-called free service.
Public benefit aggregators like Internet Archive, Wikipedia, Google
docs, universities, NGOs, are the prime abusers of visitor data, both
to their websites and by special privilege of advising visitors on how
to protect their privacy while being pickpocketed of personal data.
Cybersecurity con artists are as bad by deluding their visitors and
customers about how to protect themselves with encryption, Tor,
anonymization, OTR, secret chats, deep web, blah, blah. All these
con artists gin their own logs of trusting-users data, then either
hand it over to authorities, sell it covertly, share with cohorts
and standards orgs, write papers and give speeches soliciting
customers, testify in Congress and courts, inform grand juries,
cut plea bargains, brag about resisting NSLs, set up warrant
canaries, share tips with donors and investors, yadda, yadda,
do donate generously, but best, generate taxable income,
tax write-offs, never-ending war, paranoia and FUD.
Cryptome has no privacy or security policy to deceive visitors, and
periodically announce that, and warn not to trust us or any other
website, especially those which advocate HTTPS, anonymization,
privacy, security and crow about civil liberties and public benefit.

Snowden is to be pitied for believing giving material to the press to do with

Giving all material to the press for its mediation, interpretation and

on what to publish, hardly changes the status quo of representative, rather
than direct democracy.
Snowden and the press are complicit in withholding the alleged material
he took, even now the public does not know and may never know what
that material consists of. The soup has been contaminated by editorial
selection, redaction and interpretation. That may be inevitable with the
sordid process the press calls leaking ("wikileaks" compounds the falsity
of censorious and editorially regulated pubic participation -- wiki -- and
exploitive, biased, corrupt, dramatized disclosure -- leaks).
Withholding material by self-empowered representatives, whether Snowden
or the press, self-regulating lawyers, stock peddlers and other professionals,
is a variation on official secrecy by which secret keepers pad their income
and perks so long as they abide the cult of secrecy. All this has been
done in the Snowden affair, as well as Ellsberg's. Those who don't
abid the cult go to jail, or ruined financially, or stigmatized for life.
Even now the representatives of the government, NGOs ACLU, EFF, MSM

If crypto follows the gun model, there will be a lucrative business
bringing crypto-phones into New York. That will follow the US

"New York can and should lead the nation in protecting its citizens, and

manufacturers to turn digital devices into virtual safes that, being

It's good to see The Intercept and others smell a rat with the fake fight between
Apple and the USG (hardly only the FBI). Crediting Snowden and his flacks
with this phony crypto war is a bit much, though, opposition to government
instrusions around the world have been persistent for decades, especially
against the ever increasing digital violations and forever failing protections
against them. "Strong crypto is hard to do while making it easy for users."
What is most needed from the Snowden 90% still-secret wad are defenses
against the USG now that alarms have been repeatedly clanged about redacted
and incomplete offenses. Most peculiar that almost no defensive measures
have been released, although Snowden may have insisted on not releasing
those as threats to US national security.
Snowden's alleged demand that outlets check with USG before releases
to assure no national harm is institutionalized in national security
reporting, but is also required by fear of prosecution of outlets and
their investors such as Omidyar, Slim, Bezo, all the major media.
Withholding the 90% of Snowden material which he claims was given
to the public, is damnable betrayal of the public for monetary and
professional benefits. In this way the Snowden material has been
handled like the USG handles it, as if it is owned by the handlers,
not by the ones who paid for it.
It would not be off-base to accuse the Snowden handlers of what
Apple and the USG are doing, engaging in a fake fight "in the public
interest" for pecuniary gain. Privacy and civil liberties are being
peddled as commercial products, cheered yesterday by Apple
The DNI's Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board is as much

Snowden did the right thing, as he said, released the whole wad
to the public. Just released it to the wrong few people with no
technical capabilities but with desire for personal recognition
and profit-taking. Heading to Hong Kong "Greenwald and Poitras
danced in the aircraft's aisle upon reading sample documents,"
according to one account by Luke Harding (Greenwald denied this).
Both full release and profit-taking could have been done, and maybe
both were done, that is, the full release has been placed where more
technically capable persons have access. A few technical persons
have had limited access according to news reports, to advise the
cache withholders, but not many which is highly regrettable.
As we said in the interview there are a host of parties with greater
skills and experience publishing classified documents, National
Security Archive and Federation of American Scientists, among
them. Granted that these orgs are quite cautious about publishing
unauthorized disclosures due to their boards having close ties
to authorities and dutiful legal obedience.
No question the methodology employed by favored journalists
has been effective for engaging (entertaining) the public. The
comsec and credibility problem is that the small number of
documents released (~11%) and large number of narratives
(>100/1 of document pages) has skewed and dramatized the
disclosures such that it is impossible to know how accurate
the fragments are without access to the full wad.
Now there are rumors that the bulk of the documents may be
returned for Snowden's exculpation, which would be a great
loss for the public but swell for Snowden and his PR team.
Short shrifting the public by the media where leaks are concerned
has become, maybe always was, the norm. Direct to the public
disclosure, un-mediated, is what is needed, no secretmaking
privilege to anyone. Journalists bristle at this, claim the public
must be told what to think, and in this journalists are just like
Moreover, that Snowden allegedly requires the cache holders to
check with USG before release is pernicious, maybe false. Quite
a few of Snowden's comments appear to be scripted by those who
have him over a barrel.

Apple's fix of its devices to prevent access by outsiders surely is not like CryptoAG in which gov entry was secretly implanted. How to verify this has not been done? Political and technical challenge is that few users care about security and privacy, they just want convenience and latest style as Apple has become richer than Croseus exploiting. And Apple is hardly the only com-gov-org promising group identity and solidarity, with illusory security while primarily securing the benefits of the promiser.
Apple and govs are more similar than different and bound by loyal opposition, the very stance most beneficial to security and privacy offerers. Insecurity is the product.

End-to-end encryption is reliable only if it begins and ends without
use of computers and networked transceivers and devices, operating
systems and systems administration, electromagnetism and
algorithms, ISPs and packets.
Each of these are vulnerabilities, not unlike Tor, anonymization,
VPN, OTR, any method widely promoted and recommended.
The more widely known and adopted the less like to be secure.
So Facebook fails the same way Crypto-AG failed, and those
developed in between.
Cybersecurity is on a roll, given extra boost by Snowden releases
(limited as they are by his "do no harm to the USA") and his
continuing boosterism from protection of the other world
policeman out to make sure no encryption is invulnerable.
Currently all states are promoting limited cybersecurity in various
see-through couture but never disclosing what the states use
for hiding most-secret comsec. Snowden, among many in
the ballooning cybersec field, never advocates full disclosure,
and in that ancient way, protect their state-sanctioned privileges,
in RU as in 5-Eyes.
Facebook is regulated by the USG and through it other nations
so not likely to place its survival above that of customers. But it
certainly uses the language of customer protection pretty much
identical to all the 74 amici which jumped on board Apple's
grandstanding fight against USG, settled secretly.
Official secrecy continues to be the primary vulnerability of
cybersecurity and public comsec. No nation can survive
without it, nor can any state-regulated entity.
Without top secret code word privilege nobody is secure.
And those with that privilege willingly harm the populace
by lying and cheating and disinforming. Snowden fits that,
probably entrapped to do so by his media handlers who
dare not challenge the states which privilege media.

Understanding distinction between privacy and secrecy is essential,
for it is secrecy that corrupts in all its forms and is totally hostile to
privacy, and true privacy totally hostile to secrecy. Privacy policies are
fraudulent because they allow secretkeepers to violate privacy with
"lawful" impunity. Which is why Snowden, Tor, media, corporations,
NGOs, security experts, dual hatters, lawyers, privileged parties of
all stripes, and many others are masterful bullshitters to urge
"curation," censorship, withholding, redacting information by
which secretkeepers empower themselves against the public by
"self-regulated" access, that is self-serving.
It is ridiculous to believe technical crypto by itself will not be subverted
for political purposes, that mathematics will provide sufficient protection
against wily opponents lawfully empowered to use any methods required
to exploit vulnerabilities in people, technology, governance (standards
setting, education, contracts, advisory boards, prizes, leaks, bribery,
coercion -- partially listed in the troll tools, but far from all).
 From day one and continuing, cypherpunks warned of the unavoidable
corruption of the list by malevolent subscribers, as well as of the

come to pass worldwide, through a range of treacheries from
anonymization to crypto to HTTPS to OTR to leak sites to universities,
to whatever tool is funded and promoted as the hot shit latest means
to defy authority. Authority always wins. As authority bullshits and

Few cypherpunks have gone to jail for their convictions, many more have
gone on to pretty good paying jobs, start-ups, buy-outs by IBM, MS, Cisco,

@_subject: Julian Assange on Rubber-hose proof (cryptographically deniable) file-systems (1997) 
Precedence: bulk
Here's a copy of some correspondence in relation to my implementation
of a `rubber hose proof' (cryptographically deniable) file system
(actually implimented as a block device on which you can mount any
file system). I'm happy with the cryptographic strength of the system
(but feel free to comment anyway). That said, I'm not convinced that
my avoidance of media (i.e disk surface) analysis attacks (which could
potentially show the pre-sense or otherwise of cryptographic file
systems other than the "duress" ones) is entirely effective. I'd like
some comment from gauss-ridden declassification guru's here :)
Here's how I'm implementing `aspects' in Rubberhose/marutukku;
`aspect' is the term I'm using to refer to the
cryptographically-deniable (i.e rubber-hose-proofed) "portion", of a
maru extent i.e it's a different _aspect_ (view) of the same
underlying physical block extent.
I decided that random split lengths don't add to the security of the
scheme - only 2x from my calculations - which isn't enough to warrant
the increase in memory use and complexity involved.  The extent is
simply divided up into n splits (say 1024 or one every 256k, whichever
is smaller). Each aspect has an encrypted 32bit block remap list
(which is simply a linear array because of the fixed split size).  A
split avoidance bit-map is created from these per-aspect remap lists
on instantiation of the aspects. An individual aspect looks like so
(when saved):
typedef struct
     m_u32 keySum; /* key checksum */
     u_char masterKey[MAX_KEY];
     u_char latticeCipherType, blockCipherType;
     u_char pad[MAX_BLOCK - (4 + MAX_KEY + 1 + 1) % MAX_BLOCK]; /* block align */
} maruCycle;
typedef struct
     maruCycle cycle;
     u_char keySalt[MAX_PASSPHRASE];
     maruLatticeKey latticeKeySalt[2];
     u_char blockIV[MAX_FS_BLOCK_SIZE];
     u_char latticeSalt[2*MAX_LATTICE_DEPTH*MAX_BLOCK_KEY]; /* must be 64 aligned */
     m_u32 remap[MAX_SPLITS];
     m_u32 iterations;
     maruCipher keyCipherType;
} maruHeaderAspect;
There are an array of (8 by default) of these constructs in a maruHeader.
The smap accessor macros are simple:
	SMAP_SET(p, n) (((p))[(n)/(sizeof(maruSmap)*8)] |= (1 << ((n) % (sizeof(maruSmap)*8))))
	SMAP_CLR(p, n) (((p))[(n)/(sizeof(maruSmap)*8)] &= ~ (1 << ((n) % (sizeof(maruSmap)*8))))
	SMAP_ISSET(p, n) (((p))[(n)/(sizeof(maruSmap)*8)] & (1 << ((n) % (sizeof(maruSmap)*8))))
By default, each unused maruHeaderAspect struct contains random noise
(except for keyCipherType, which defaults to being the same for all
aspects) and is of course indistinguishable from a valid maruAspect
without the associated key.
Instantiation example:
Say you have three valid aspects, a1, a2 and a3. Arbitrarily, you have
chosen a1 to be the simple duress aspect (i.e ``you expect us to
believe you have solitary letter of donation to the Polit Bureau Ball
in your entire encrypted file system?! Do you know what this is Nikov?
. THIS is the finest cryptanalytic device known to
man. THIS is a RUBBERHOSE! *thwap* *thwunk* *boink*. Now... what's the
*real* key Nikov... or should we call you... Nikolay Bukharin?''), a2 to
be the limited disclosure aspect ("Dear diary. Nikita, Ivan, Boris and
came over today and smoked a *shit load* of hash. Not wanting to
offend, I had a toke, but like that capitalist dog
^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H illustious leader of the freeworld, was
careful not to inhale.") and a3 has your ice-9 formula nicely tucked
You decide one fine morning that you want to add an ATP pre-cursor as
a catalyst to your ice-9 recipe of destruction (ostensibly, you plan
to generate this stuff from cultures of genetically modified mouse
liver cell mitochondria), and provide the a1, a2 and a3 pass-phrases.
a1, a2 and a3 are decrypted. the aspect remap is parsed and used to
create the physical block "avoidance" map (checking for conflicts
along the way).
Joyous about the frozen seas to come, you copy the ATP pre-cursor
catalyst into a3 and the file system tries to write a new block - e.g
b28 - to a3.  b28 is translated through the a3 remap table to b-1
(unallocated). A random block remap number is generated e.g b595 and
tested against the avoidance smap. If free, it is marked and chosen to
be the new a3 mapping, otherwise the algorithm simply does a circular
hunt for the next free entry in the avoidance smap.
Naturally, reading only requires the key of the aspect you are
interested in (divulging). Writing to one aspect without the keys to
the other aspects will randomly trash them as new splits are assigned.
This would be the simple end of it, were it not but for magnetic
domain leakage/disk surface wear analysis attacks. Theoretically, this
sort of attack could used to demonstrate access patterns by the drive
head in regions outside those used by the duress aspect blocks. What
we want to do here is to make sure the non-data carrying
magnetic/other properties of the disk substrate are as close to a
Jackson Pollock painting as is possible. i.e totally random :) Three
methods are used:
All aspects are defined to take up 100% of the marutukku extent from
the file-system perspective - this is essential to our deniability
scheme. This works fine with most file-systems - e.g UFS, because they
only write to a small fraction of their addressable blocks when
formatted - i.a few super-blocks and inode, rather than zeroing every
block, and so split usage for a given aspect reflects population of
the file system that pertains to it.

For Mr. Heimbach is far from alone in his esteem for Mr. Putin. Throughout the collection of white ethnocentrists, nationalists, populists and neo-Nazis that has taken root on both sides of the Atlantic, Mr. Putin is widely revered as a kind of white knight: a symbol of strength, racial purity and traditional Christian values in a world under threat from Islam, immigrants and rootless cosmopolitan elites.
"I've always seen Russia as the guardian at the gate, as the easternmost outpost of our people," said Sam Dickson, a white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan lawyer who frequently speaks at gatherings of the so-called alt-right, a far-right fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist and anti-immigrant positions. "They are our barrier to the Oriental invasion of our homeland and the great protector of Christendom. I admire the Russian people. They are the strongest white people on earth."
His voice amplified by Russian-funded think tanks, the Orthodox Church and state-controlled news media, like RT and Sputnik, that are aimed at foreign audiences, Mr. Putin has in recent years reached out to conservative and nationalist groups abroad with the message that he stands with them against gay rights activists and other forces of moral decay.
He first embraced this theme when, campaigning for his third term as president in early 2012, he presented Russia not only as a military power deserving of international respect, but also as a "civilizational model" that could rally all those in Russia and beyond who were fed up with the erosion of traditional values.
The Kremlin has also provided financial and logistical support to far-right forces in the West, said Peter Kreko, an analyst at Political Capital, a research group in Budapest. Though Jobbik, a neo-Nazi party in Hungary and other groups have been accused of receiving money from Moscow, the only proven case so far involves the National Front in France, which got loans worth more than $11 million from Russian banks.
Russia also shares with far-right groups across the world a deeply held belief that, regardless of their party, traditional elites should be deposed because of their support for globalism and transnational institutions like NATO and the European Union.

Those familiar with George Orwell's "1984" will recall that "Newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of thought." I recently felt the weight of this Orwellian ethos when many of my students sent emails to inform me, and perhaps warn me, that my name appears on the Professor Watchlist, a new website created by a conservative youth group known as Turning Point USA.
I could sense the gravity in those email messages, a sense of relaying what is to come. The Professor Watchlist's mission, among other things, is to sound an alarm about those of us within academia who "advance leftist propaganda in the classroom." It names and includes photographs of some 200 professors.
The Watchlist appears to be consistent with a nostalgic desire "to make America great again" and to expose and oppose those voices in academia that are anti-Republican or express anti-Republican values. For many black people, making America "great again" is especially threatening, as it signals a return to a more explicit and unapologetic racial dystopia. For us, dreaming of yesterday is not a privilege, not a desire, but a nightmare.
The new "watchlist" is essentially a new species of McCarthyism, especially in terms of its overtones of "disloyalty" to the American republic. And it is reminiscent of Cointelpro, the secret F.B.I. program that spied on, infiltrated and discredited American political organizations in the '50s and '60s. Its goal of "outing" professors for their views helps to create the appearance of something secretly subversive. It is a form of exposure designed to mark, shame and silence.
So, in my classrooms, I refuse to remain silent in the face of racism, its subtle and systemic structure. I refuse to remain silent in the face of patriarchal and sexist hegemony and the denigration of women's bodies, or about the ways in which women have internalized male assumptions of how they should look and what they should feel and desire.
I refuse to be silent about forms of militarism in which innocent civilians are murdered in the name of "democracy." I refuse to remain silent when it comes to acknowledging the existential and psychic dread and chaos experienced by those who are targets of xenophobia and homophobia.
I refuse to remain silent when it comes to transgender women and men who are beaten to death by those who refuse to create conditions of I refuse to remain silent in a world where children become targets of sexual violence, and where unarmed black bodies are shot dead by the state and its proxies, where those with disabilities are mocked and still rendered "monstrous," and where the earth suffers because some of us refuse to hear its suffering, where my ideas are marked as "un-American," and apparently Well, if it is dangerous to teach my students to love their neighbors, to think and rethink constructively and ethically about who their neighbors are, and how they have been taught to see themselves as disconnected and neoliberal subjects, then, yes, I am dangerous, and what I teach is dangerous.

Matt Taibbi reports on Assange in Rolling Stone in a one of the more salient grasps of what journalism has missed about WikiLeaks feeding its maw.
A noteworthy observation is how all the risk is taken by leakers not by publishers and journalists -- nor by WikiLeaks and Assange.
Nearly every major leak to WikiLeaks (and the media) has led to the leaker being hammered while the publishers are awarded prizes, as with WikiLeaks.
That is evident from the number of leakers who have been severly punished while WikiLeaks and Assange is showered with glory.and repetitive news coverage. Wikipedia's WikiLeaks entry is grotesque.
That's asymmetric racketeering side of leakage, to the benefit of journalists, publishers, lawyers and public interest organizations, all of whom are granted special privileges by authorities and in many cases handsome donations from fat cats through tax benefits.
Its as if by overdoing lauding Assange and WikiLeaks those who have taken the highest risk can be slighted with impunity. Only fools would leak if they knew what is in store for them, not just the brief attention dispensed by outlets.

This contrast is what differs highly confident, courageous, intelligent Tim from always insulting, insecure, cowardly, ignorant Trump and similar pretentious grandstanders.
The cpunks potpourri of personas and means of expression is what made it so addictive to those tired of numbing public and professional prevariacative discourse of education, law, politics, diplomacy, warmaking, finance, art, religion, nearly all sounding and meaning much the same: mono-educated, censorious, judgmental, biased, intolerant, smooth-talking lies and false promises, in the end treacherous, often murderous, against anyone who refused to obey house rules.

He understood the frontier had closed, anarcho-libertarians the last holdouts, the East Coast Globalist  hordes rapidly exterminating dissidents, rebels, outcasts. Pockets of resistance, like cpunks, anonymists, official secrecy opponents, grew quieter, he did not. So faced late in life ridicule and stigma. No problema for Tim, that.

6 September 2002
ANNOUNCEMENT: Cypherpunks Meeting and Party/BBQ, Saturday, September 14th, 2002. Tim May's house, Corralitos, California.
* WHAT?: Ten years ago this month the first Cypherpunks meeting. Cypherpunks meeting and party. Several interesting talks are planned, though nothing of the usual "political action" sort. A flexible agenda will be posted at the meeting. I am hoping we can have as stimulating a discussion as we had at our first meetings a decade ago.
* WHEN?: Saturday, September 14th, 1 p.m. to "late." (A limited amount of people can stay overnight--ask me about it.) Formal talks will probably run for several hours, then the informal and BBQ/party takes over. People can arrive as early as 1 p.m. and hang out, but the formal agenda will start promptly at 2.
* WHERE?: Tim May's house in Corralitos, east of Santa Cruz and north of Watsonville. 427 Allan Lane, Corralitos. Detailed driving instructions at the end of this message...or use one of the many mappers on the Net. It takes about an hour to get from Sunnyvale to my house, about 40 miles, so plan your travel accordingly.
* WHO?: Cypherpunks and friends who are not narcs or Feds. Contrary to some meetings in the past, this is NOT an "open meeting, open to all." That strategy worked OK for some meetings in public places where certain kinds of software were to be distributed. But my house is a private residence. I have nothing against legitimate cops enforcing legitimate laws, but I don't want persecutors traipsing through my house, perhaps planting evidence, looking for signs of illegal activities or grounds for a warrant, etc. This is a PRIVATE RESIDENCE and I intend to escort to the door anyone who is unknown to others. If you are a lurker who doesn't know anybody and you want to attend, send me e-mail and we'll arrange something.
* WHAT ELSE?: Parking may be tight. And because of the distance, carpooling with your friends would be good. A cat lives in the house...don't leave any doors open, and tell me if you see him get out.
* CHILDREN?: My house is not child-friendly, and I don't have time to make sure nothing dangerous is exposed. Please leave children out of this meeting/party.
* FOOD: If you stay for the evening BBQ and party, bring something to share. Don't everyone bring a bag of chips! The Corralitos Market is a popular place for meats, sausages, etc. (Don't everyone bring sausages, either!) And if you drink, remember the drive home.
--Tim May (location instructions below)
Getting to Tim May's house in Corralitos:
427 Allan Lane (MapQuest works well). 831-728-0152
 From Santa Cruz, south on Highway 1. Take Freedom Boulevard exit in Aptos. Go inland, on Freedom Blvd.  Travel about 5 miles, to first stop sign. Take a left on Corralitos Road. At the the next stop sign, the Corralitos Market (good sausages!) will be on your left. Just before the stop sign, bear right on Brown's Valley Road. Cross bridge and then bear left as Brown's Valley Road turns. Travel about one mile to Allan Lane, on the right.
Allan Lane is at about the "360" mailbox point on Brown's Valley Road...if you go too far and enter the redwoods, turn back! Drive to top of hill on Allan Lane.  At top, bear left, over a small rise, past a house on the left, then down my driveway. My house will be the white stucco semi-Spanish style, with a red Explorer and black Mercedes in the driveway.
Note for parties: You can park either in my driveway or at the top of the hill and walk a few hundred feet. Don't block any driveways!
 From points south of Santa Cruz, take Green Valley Road exit off of Highway 1. Travel about 2 miles to Freedom Boulevard. Turn left. Then right at Corralitos Road.

Hi there,
I am a reporter at Wired News. We received notice of the upcoming Cypherpunks 10th anniversary bash. I am thinking of writing a short article about the history and current status of the cypherpunk community.
Obviously, things have changed a lot in the last 10 years. I imagine that you and other cypherpunks would have much to say on the topic. Please feel free to rant and rave to me about whatever you feel would be relevant to this kind of article.
When did the Cypherpunks come into existence? Who were the founding members? What was the inital purpose? What kinds of people are involved?
Who (socially, I mean, not names!) exactly are the members of the group? How many at any one time? Is it a rotating membership, with people coming and going?
There has been a substantial amount of press dedicated to the Cypherpunks, what's been the community response?
Have their been internal discussions about the repercussions of the media's involvement and the like?
Wired News had a very familiar relationship with the cypherpunks - has it been viewed as a positive thing?
Have the ideals of the group changed over the years?
Are there any manifestos or official statements from the group that I can access?
What are the future plans for the cypherpunks?
I attempted to access cypherpunks.com but most of the links are dead, why isn't anyone maintaining it? Or is it unrelated to the current community?
With whom else are the cypherpunks allied?
What do you, personally, have to say about the future of the Internet, privacy, legislation, hacking, phreaking, cyber terrorism, the governement. etc?
And finally, who else should I be talking to?
Thanks for your time. I am hoping to get the story done before the end of next week (i.e., before the actual party.) Of course, I would never publish the location of the party or any other information that you don't feel comfortable about.

I am also available at 415.276.3925. Please leave me a message if I'm away from my desk. I am more than happy to call you back.

@_subject: Tim May 1992 Post on Future of Cyberspace/Cryptology/Digital Money/Transnationalism 
Tim May 1992 Post on Future of Cyberspace/Cryptology/Digital Source: Some thoughts on the recent meetings and what we're doing:
1. The importance of trading physical goods in the Crypto Anarchy
This, in my view, has been given undue and misleading importance.
Physical goods are inherently easy to trace through remailers (via
sniffers, radioactive tracers, weight of packages, and many other
physical cues), are hard to store physically (imagine getting 100
parcels for later remailing), and, most importantly, have none of the
"envelope within envelope within...." protection accorded to the bits
of a cryptographic remailing, or DC-Net, system! The elegance of
cryptographic protocols is lost with physical goods.
Furthermore, physical delivery of any good, whether drugs, stolen
missile components, antiquities and art items, whatever, is
fundamentally a hard problem to solve...smugglers and thieves have
been dealing this since the beginning of time. Stings can be easily
arranged, delivery is not anonymous (one merely watches who takes
delivery, or who opens a train station locker, etc....this is all SOP
for narcs and counterespionage types), and a raid on a remailing
entity will result in confiscation of the physical goods and (likely)
prosecution of those caught holding the stuff. (Raiding a bit
remailing entity produces only random-appearing bits...granted, the
authorities may well outlaw bit remailing, or use the RICO and
conspiracy/sedition laws to prosecute, but that's another topic.)
Our recent emphasis on physical goods, and all the ideas pouring in on
what other kinds of "contraband" besides drugs can be used, is
misleading. None of the richness of the cryptographic world is
faithfully preserved. I urge we get back to our roots and deal only
with things that can be expressed purely in bit form.
2. The "colonization of cyberspace" does not mean there is no
interaction with the physical world, of course. But that interaction
can be mediated with money made by converting information or digital
money into physical money. Several methods for this conversion path
can be considered:
-Alice sells information in the cyberspace domain for the equivalent
of, say, $30,000. She converts this to "real" dollars by using an
escrow entity which hold both sides of the transaction until it's
completed. They then mail the information to the purchaser and send an
ordinary check "for services rendered" to Alice for $30K. She reports
it on her taxes, probably as a "consulting fee" (for which essentially
no government supervision currently exists, nor is likely to....), and
the conversion has taken place. (Note: there are still elements of
trust involved, notably involving the escrow agent, but trust works
pretty well for many things, especially when reputations are at
stake. Understanding how real businesses depend on reputations is a
missing part of modern cryptology analyses of transactions...the
protocol analyzers and number theorists almost never take into account
how reputations work in the real world, But I digress.)
-Alice and Bob trade information such that Bob gets the information
worth about $30K, as above, and Alice gets another piece of
information she can use in the "real world" that is worth about $30K.
This might be stock tips, or, better, information she can turn around
and sell in the "open market" of a service like AMIX! There are lots
of wrinkles, inefficiencies, etc., to be worked out.
-And then there is digital money. You all know about this, or should.
David Chaum, DigiCash, blinded notes, credentials, etc. The handout
for the first meeting had a glossary of terms. (IMHO, we should be
spending more of our time at our meeting discussing this, and less in
playing more interations of the Game.)
The fascinating novel "Snow Crash," by Neil Stephenson, makes a
mistake in having Hiro Protagonist a very wealthy man in the Metaverse
(Stephenson's term for the virtual reality cyberspace) but a very poor
man in the Real World. Information _is_ money. Information is liquid,
flows across borders, and is generally convertible into real money.
(One simple conversion strategy, alluded to above, is for Alice to
sell her information for, say, $500K, and then to receive a
"consulting contract," perhaps called a "retainer," of $50K a year for
the next 20 years. Her retainer is fully legal, is perhaps handled
through cut-outs who specialize in this kind of thing, and is a
low-risk way to "launder" money from cyberspace into the real world. I
have a lot more to say on these schemes, perhaps later.)
3. Are we emphasizing "The Game" too much?
If the goal is to produce a paper-based game, similar to "Monopoly" or
fantasy role-playing games, then I suppose more practice is needed.
But I'm not sure how worthwhile it is to try to design such a game.
(Those who wish to should do so, then commercialize it, and become the
Avalon Hill of crypto games!)
If the goal is educational, for newly interested folks, then I also
question how much more effort should be put into it. The ideas of
anonymous remailers, of digital money, etc., are, I think, gotten
across in the first 60 minutes of the game, especially if some of the
formalism is first explained (as it was at the first game, where
digital mixes, tamper-resistand modules for implementing mixes, the
"Dining Cryptographers Protocol," and digital money had all been
freshly covered, so participants were putting the theory to test).
I found the first game was instructive, the second much less so (and
_not_ because of the focus on drug selling...that was a relatively
minor issue). My impression is that many of the newcomers--and they
should jump in here with their own reactions (too bad we don't have
hypertext links!)--didn't really know how remailing mixes work, how
digital psueodnyms can protect privacy in transactions, and how the
"Game" was intended to exercise these concepts.
4. We need to talk about the charter or purpose of the "Cypherpunks"
or "Cryptology Amateurs for Social Irresponsibility" (CASI--Eric
Hughes's term) group.
-Is it mostly educational?
-Is it a lobbying group, as are EFF, CPSR, and the like?
-Is it to produce remailers, digital money, and other programming?
-Is it subversive?
Now clearly we can't say it's subversive (any bets on who's gatewaying
these messages to Other Listeners?). But we also don't want to skew
things toward "YALG" (Yet Another Lobbying Group), nor do we want to
be a spoon-feeding educational group for people with a casual (and
transient) interest in crypto stuff.
5. There have have been several messages so far about worries about
the legal implications of these topics, about how some
corporate-affiliated subscribers will desubscribe "real fast" if
certain discussion trends continue, and so on. Now we can't please
everybody, but maybe we ought to talk about this sensitive issue soon,
and _in person_.
Since it relates to our charter, Point 4 above, I recommend we do this
at our next meeting. I'd favor that over another iteration of the
In conclusion, we are in at the beginning of Something Big. While I'm
somewhat skeptical about the claims for things like nanotech, I see
this whole cyberspace/cryptology/digital money/transnationalism ball of
wax being _much_ easier to implement. Networks are multiplying beyond
any hope of government control, bandwidths are skyrocketing, CPUs are
putting awesome power on our desktops, PGP is generating incredible
interest, and social trends are making the time right for crypto
I look forward to hearing your views.

This group is woefully unqualified to judge the cause of WTC collapses. We have observed its gradual growth with half-baked theories intended to bedazzle gullible consumers.
Meanwhile the structural engineer of the WTC Twin Towers, Leslie E. Roberston, has been successful at reestablishing his reputation so much that his firm (LERA) is the top structural peer reviewer for NYC's supertall structures.
This is not to overlook the likelihood of Robertson's peer review is not part of a public deception about the safety of supertalls as the City of New York Department of Buildings has sharply diminished its evaluation of submitted construction drawings since 1975 under pressure from banks, developers and contractrs and after 9/11 accelerated its sweethearting to favor supertalls by use of, what else, replacement of experienced human reviewers with inexperienced computer jockies who are forbidden to visit and inspect actual construction sites.

Of course, the WL list is a gov-vetting/deception/withholding/redacting/favored outlet operation, modeled on national security/mortality-terrorism practiced from Day One.
Still, the file list is far more valuable than the Assange idolization which has become obscene, even    Jim Jones-like as it has lured many into its honey trap, Ecuador/Five Eyes/Manning/Snowden. The Intercept complicit in shared spotlight.
Assange has peddled personal glorification since the origination of WikiLeaks, aided by skills of an accomplished troubador, actor, self-promoter, hacker, wife/mother/female/underlings exploiter.
Nothing unusual about that for it capitalizes! on the essential role of government, business and institution to glorify themselves and bloodsuck their supporters angling for being part of something other than their squalid selves.
Rebels know nothing beyond adopting the means and methods of those they rebel against in order to be elected into The Elect and shit on, rape, the willing unelect. No wonder self-loathing journalists, enslaved by advertising-enslaved publishers are drawn to, celebrate, professional con-artists. Headlines and bylines rule, forget what follows the bleeding myrhh, aka leaked documents.
Assange is leaking suicidal Kool-Aid begun at this fountainhead of disparagement and sucking up to authorities who dispense privileges, "constitutional," got it, via NGO tax minimization and agreement to quietly vet disclosures ahead of public release. Donors don't risk their fortunes.
Thus, this very list's creation and continued celebration/denigration of its fucked-up pseudo-rebellious cutsie-brand. Mea culpa maxima.

Well foretold.
Disclosure of national security secrets has become a cult as addictive and crippling as non-disclosure, NDA v. leaks. Both suffer excessive secrecy as if wedded in a vainglorious conspiracy to claim to protect and reveal much but carefully dispense only that which buttresses their information and power control, eyeing and emulating one another to guarantee mutual benefits.
Neither fully serves the populace, instead disdains consumers, propagandas for product, adopts one another's practices, revolving doors their practitioners, aided and abetted by governments pretending to act on behalf of their subjects. Prosecutors, judges, legislators, executives, lockstep with each other and with their ostensible opponents, especially the governmentally-privileged wealthy, NGOs, journalists and manufactures of weaponry, hardware and software, paid and free.
Periodic orchestrated campaigns of Ellsbergs, Mannings, Snowdens, et al, signal breakaway insiders but merely confirm these are standard operating procedures for limited disclosure to boost reputations of disclosers and non-disclosers.
The Internet promised a change with free software, free access, free discourse, and immediately became dominated by practitioners of duplicity, openness concealing secrecy, deceptions long established. Witness this very forum and its vanity description on Wikipedia.
Or more telling, the Web, Wikimedia and Archive, kissing cousins of Google, SM, aggregators, bots, Tor, Deep Web, all dancing to the tune of TLAs with Terms of Service, privacy policies, redactions, omissions, secure submissions, open source vetting, which baldly disclose cooperation with authorities, trust us even so.
This is all well known and belabored, hustled and lipsticked, mea culpa. Still, there are possibilities for avoiding the domination of, and manipulation by, secretkeepers and their complicit opponents. One is to keep away from the most popular and promoted infosec, comsec, techsec, privacy, indeed, sec in all its permuations, especially that associated with natsec -- the civil-military-commercial-NGO occult.
Secrecy and leakage, don't believe anything about them, same coin.

"Open source" was, is, a magnificent ploy to get access to inventions and information that might have once been kept out of sight by the makers and a few associates. Open source crypto still robbing the guileless by the guilers. Internet, especially its web glorification, another. Wikipedia, Wayback, Google, SM, an almost endless stream of opportunities developed to lure with free services to grab consumer yearnings, opinions, fellows, followers, beliefs, fears, for feeding tailored operations (thx NSA) worldwide to ingest and digest.
Consider in this smearing thread, Snowden's openly disclosed 6 top secret years as CIA employee with specific tools and informarion of operations completely unrevealed while piddling months of contractor service with NSA is generously touted as if high-value golden coin.
In this roasting comedy, Snowden would be the one who runs the NSA snatch for CIA, NSA unable to admit that it was snookered by its number one competitor. CIA dancing in the aisles, toasting its win with one the oldest cons in history: the orchestrated aggrieved insider.
Assange has commented on WikiLeaks being used as a con op, melding accurate material with the bullshit disinfo. As with advertisers and prosecutors, though, he implies this mix is unavoidable, consumers and juries do not want shades of truth, the whole truth and nothing but must be declared to make sales and collaterally murder.
Comedian Camp is right to observe, the overtly guilty are not punished, they are rewarded with prizes and medals, to wit, sanitized Edward Snowden, the "Snowden era" grandly avowed.

On the other hand, banning 8chan could set a bad precedent, and it could make it harder for law enforcement authorities to monitor violent extremists. Cloudflare, like other tech companies with a window onto dark internet activity, can share information about crimes with investigators.
Banning 8chan "would make our lives a lot easier," Mr. Prince said, "but it would make the job of law enforcement and controlling hate groups online harder."

UNTRACEABLE MARKETS FOR ASSASSINATIONS
To make this brutally concrete, here's how escrow makes murder contracts
much safer than they are today to negotiate. Instead of one party being
caught in an FBI sting, as is so often the case when amateurs try to
arrange hits, they can use an escrow service to insulate themselves from:
1. From being traced, because the exchanges are handled via pseudonyms
2. From the killer taking the money and then not performing the hit,
because the escrow agent holds the money until the murder is verified
(according to some prototocol, such a newspaper report...again, an area for
more work, thankfully).
3. From being arrested when the money is picked up, as this is all done via
digital cash.
There are some ways to reduce the popularity of this Murder, Incorporated
system. (Things I've been thinking about for about 6 years, and which we
discussed on the list and on the Extropians list. I'll save this for
another time.)
My point here is to show how on-line clearing works in conjunction with an
escrow agent function.(Esther clears the cash, and can issue new cash to
Bob, who "trusts" her that if he does the job, the cash will clear, as
she's the escrow agent he's dealt with many times before.)
Markets for assassinations--untraceable and unlinkable--have been a
topic of discussion for a long time. You'll find them explicitly
mentioned in my 1988 "Crypto Anarchist Manifesto."

Critique of Tor applies equally, perhaps moreso, to the whole Internet for monetization, technology, personnel, administration, operation, funding, seducing the public, NGOs, dissent. So too, to crypto, anonymization, cypherpunks.
Perennial question is how to sort through the tsunami of claims and counterclaims, sponsored hacks, slyly appealing "free" SM, search engines, FOIA enterprises, Wayback and Wikipedia, paid and volunteer informants and agents, hot shit mail lists and get-it-now podcasts, star-studded conferences and outlaw-celebrity lectures, incarcerated Julians and Jeremys, fans and evermore fans of unexamined underwriters.
Has there ever been more people eagerly declaring in public their likes and hatreds, convictions and doubts, hoping to gain advantage over other people by pretense and deception. Actually, yes, there has been since talking, singing, dancing, education, civilization was invented to entrap prey.
Prey quickly learned from predators to reverse the panopticon. Usually by offering their gullible, edible kids, cohorts and mates as irresistable bait to fatten the enemy into overconfidence, sloth, braggrdy, imagined supremacy. Tor, like Trump, is hardly novel in this suicidalism, nor the crusading, diabolical internet of everything data.

The Tim May message came from the cpunks archives. Tim died not long ago.
The archives hold quite a bit of discussion about prosecution of Jim Bell and CJ Parker and various subpoenas disclosed and presumbably some which were not. Likely several persons were contacted directly by the prosecutors but not shared on the list. That continues.
No question cpunks  has served as a waterhole to be spied by predators. So too the whole Internet, public and private archives, anonymizers, so on.
 From the beginning there have been plants of informers, instigators, provocateurs, and kin stirring the pot. IP hosts and system administrators remain the primary sources of data, overt and covert.
Multi-level log files are ubiquitous, from identifying packets to end to end foolhardists. No way to use the Internet undetected. Programs that promise that are deceptive, Tor only one of the ploys. Privacy has been a sham from the get-go,  Comsec and infosec, crypto in particular, are porous by design, ignorance, opportunism, profit. Open source a cartoonish protective condom, adherents of it are con artists.
Cpunks like leak sites are stings, witting or unwitting. Mea culpa.
Jim Bell is a Sabu, subject to federal sanctions as ex-con if not willing to solicit supporters and unwary victims. There are thousands of them. Those most loudly anti-authority are the experts of betrayal for kings coin and to avoid going back to jail.
Cpunks archives offer much to support this critique, other archives and live action even more. Cyber security is a huge racket profiting from deliberately ineffective cybersec.

WikiLeaks/Assange is primarily a source not a journalist and journalists customarily sacrifice sources to save themselves.
Assange in the early days of WikiLeaks was harshly critical of journalists and adopted the journalist cloak when journalists joined the org and shit started to come down.
WikiLeaks has sacrificed sources to save itself. But like journalists continues to claim it protects sources in order to keep leaks coming in. Also contacts authorities for approval like journalists, redacts documents, hustles for funding reportedly now in the millions of dollars, brays about its public service, avidly advertises itself, breaks laws under guise of constitutional privilege, etc.
Assanges's sexual predation like celebrities is same as that of star journalists, which stardom is hardly the norm for grunts of low-paid journalists who hate investors, publishers, editors and stars.
WikiLeaks originally promised public participation of a wiki but within months it was revealed to be an Assange promotional tool, heirarchical, high-handed, censorious, secret, cultish. Now wealthy as MSM.
WikiLeaks remains a valuable public resource but needs to shed Assange, secrecy, con artistry, obnoxious promotion by celebrity defenders out to promote themselves. It was intended to be an alternative to commercial journalism but lost its way due to Assange's misbehavior even now being glamorized, way too many vulgarians cheering his performance.

More on Crypto AG
[2020.03.06] One follow-on to the story of Crypto AG being owned by the CIA: this interview with a Washington Post reporter. The whole thing is worth reading or listening to, but I was struck by these two quotes at the end:
...in South America, for instance, many of the governments that were using Crypto machines were engaged in assassination campaigns. Thousands of people were being disappeared, killed. And I mean, they're using Crypto machines, which suggests that the United States intelligence had a lot of insight into what was happening. And it's hard to look back at that history now and see a lot of evidence of the United States going to any real effort to stop it or at least or even expose it.
To me, the history of the Crypto operation helps to explain how U.S. spy agencies became accustomed to, if not addicted to, global surveillance. This program went on for more than 50 years, monitoring the communications of more than 100 countries. I mean, the United States came to expect that kind of penetration, that kind of global surveillance capability. And as Crypto became less able to deliver it, the United States turned to other ways to replace that. And the Snowden documents tell us a lot about how they did that.

The Times was well aware when it published these statements that they were not true. The Times' own previous reporting had confirmed the falsity of these statements. But The Times published these statements anyway, knowing them to be false, and knowing it would misinform and mislead its own readers, because of The Times' extreme bias against and animosity toward the Campaign, and The Times' exuberance to improperly influence the presidential election in November 2020.

Assange will be sacrificed and discarded by journalists once no longer useful. This is a long-standing practice to assure official protection and privilege. Assange once advocated this warning but was eventully coopted by journalists who joined his team and pushed the outreach to duplicitous journalism.
Braying about threat to journalism by Assange's prosecution is a deception op conducted in cooperation with authorities. Snowden's promoters have admitted consulting with USG on what to publish, what to redact, what to withhold. Barton Gellman describes his following this CYA standard procedure in Dark Mirror.
WikiLeaks burned sources with loose security, incoherent management, Julian's vanity and opportunism, thinking he could use cohorts for his purpose without penalty. The indictment outlines the parties he enlisted, quite a few likely to have decided to cooperate, like Sabu, the "Teenager," maybe Appelbaum, others pseudonymed.
Those he has manipulated will turn against him under pressure from prosecutors against them, their families and friends. Same happened to Manning, Swartz, kirakou, Hammond, long list of others.
Snowden will eventually be handed over to USG by those he came to trust the most. Trust wears thin over time and goosed by planted suspicions and doubts, ambition, need for income. And fans are notoriously fickle, don't give a shit after the excitement wanes, smears are spread, bots and media countermesures are unleashed, rewards are offered like Greenwald's "irresistables" undergirding The And there is always the AP option for terminating JA.

"LulzSec (who by then was cooperating with the FBI)"
"Since the early days of WikiLeaks, Assange has spoken at
hacking conferences to tout his own history as a famous teenage hacker
in Australia and to encourage others to hack to obtain information for
WikiLeaks.  In 2009, for instance, Assange told the Hacking At
Random conference that WikiLeaks had obtained nonpublic documents from
the Congressional Research Service by exploiting a small vulnerability
inside the document distribution system of the United States Congress,
and then asserted that [t]his is what any one of you would find if you
were actually looking.
In 2010, Assange gained unauthorized access to a government computer
system of a NATO country.  In 2012, Assange communicated directly
with a leader of the hacking group LulzSec (who by then was cooperating
with the FBI), and provided a list of targets for LulzSec to hack. 
With respect to one target, Assange asked the LulzSec leader to look for
(and provide to WikiLeaks) mail and documents, databases and pdfs. 
In another communication, Assange told the LulzSec leader that the most
impactful release of hacked materials would be from the CIA, NSA, or the
New York Times.  WikiLeaks obtained and published emails from
a data breach committed against an American intelligence consulting
company by an Anonymous and LulzSec-affiliated hacker.  According
to that hacker, Assange indirectly asked him to spam that victim company
In addition, the broadened hacking conspiracy continues to allege that
Assange conspired with Army Intelligence Analyst Chelsea Manning to crack
a password hash to a classified U.S. Department of Defense

CryptoAG is a noteworthy example of the deception but its confirmation too is a diversion from more deeply hidden subterfuges.
Then Tor, I2P, CJDNS, Secure Drop, Signal, et al, each eagerly boosted than gradually falling in credibility and trustworthiness to be succeeded by new borns.
It might be worth pondering Snowden's quite limited "gift to the public" as another active measure to bamboozle in the WikiLeaks manner, indeed media-born leaks as a principal tool to meddle with information and data, not that any digital method can compete with the internet itself for that role.
The recent post about crypto's failure to serve the underprivileged, citing cypherpunks as an example, is indicative of where a next step for injecting compromised sec tools is headed, following bitcoin's amazing rise as top tracker of finance under pretense of untraceability.

Appeal of pedophilia, or any sexual predation, is that it is forbidden, by custom, law, religion, belief, psychopathology.
Doesn't matter what the rationale or preventative regulation stipulates, so long as it is banned that makes the violation alluring.
If it is okay to do whatever is banned, appeal disappears. The normal is a turnoff, so its got to dressed in cosmetics, costume, behavior, edict, law, shame, risk, daring, locker room talk, braggardy, you know, the stuff marketed by the sex trade, religion, espionage, charm school, higher education, vulgarity trainers, prosecutors, lawyers, judges, wives and husbands, parents and children being prepared to be lasciviously appealing adults.
Stigmatizing porn and masturbation has just about disappeared by overflowing marketplaces and behavior sanctioning professions. The LBQT dot dot dot is expanding almost as fast as global election meddling and lurid entertainment, all lagging and emulating official and commercial and religious spying and reporting upsetting information.
War slaughter is the top sexual predation, every human a potential actor and victim. Once addicted to massive bloodletting not much can compete, although masturbation througn simulations in carnage-rich games is racing to outdo the unpleasantly real. Shortly games wizards will drive the actual standoff homicides. To be sure, games wizards do not expect to be beaten to pulp by more capable punks.
Place your bets on whether CIC Mr. T makes it to November in one piece, unfucked.

Use of any online or digital programs and/or devices for comsec/infosec should be avoided unless completely enclosed and transmitted with non-online or non-digital means. There are a number of non-onlne and non-digital means available, the first and most reliable is your brain so long as it is not contaminated with belief in online and digital prejudice now over a century in promulgaton. The principal efforts for this promulgation is computers, coding, obfuscation, propaganda, arcanity, scientism, residual astrology, confidence gaming, spouting mantras, i.e., "cypherpunks write code."
This oh so cool mantra derives from the magicial, bewitching lodestone "national security," the abiding weapon of nations governed as royalty, heirarchical, the few overlording the many with force, elections, education, faith and trivializing deriviatives of entertainment, media, chat, parties, militants, rebels, revolutionaries, independents, intellectuals, geniuses, "democracies" ruled by  kingdoms of presidents, congresses, courts.
Nonetheless, always a nonetheless apologia for top-down regimes, far more rewarding to cooperate with authorities than to defy them, more lucrative too. So backdoors in crypto, each and every version, must be inherent code, along with outpourings of assurances there are workarounds to escape the many and be one of the few. Today, that is marketed as "smart."
