Xerces doesn't use a namespace.  Since Xerces is highly portable to a
variety of platforms, namespaces are avoided because some compilers do not
support namespaces.

If I remember correctly, including the Microsoft msxml.h file automatically
has a "using" clause in it, or their examples do.  Either don't use their
files, since you're using Xerces instead, or find and remove the "using
Msxml" clause.
