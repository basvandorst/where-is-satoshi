By all means do post interesting and relevant discussion on the lists,
but please don't cross-post to multiple mailing lists with nothing but
cut-and-pasted content from a conference web site, as here.
(I'm not going to respond to the misrepresentation in the talk
abstract itself, but if you're so inclined, do share what you found
interesting about the talk.)
