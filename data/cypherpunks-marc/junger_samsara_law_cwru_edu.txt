is one out of California involving Adobe where a federal district

The East Coast case which was decided against the publisher arose
in the federal district court for New York and was finally decided
the wrong way by the 2d Circuit court of appeals.
The California case arose in the California courts and was
based almost entirely on trade secret claims.  (The only way
that licenses got into the case was the claim that the
original parties who had done the reverse engineering were
bound by license agreements to keep the information secret.)
In that case the good guys have won so far.

That isn't the reason why a click-through agreement isn't enforceable---the agreement could, were it enforceable, validlly
forbid reverse engineering for any reason and that clause would
in most cases be upheld.  But, unless you buy your software from
the copyright owner, you own your copy of the software and
clicking on a so called agreement with the copyright owner
that you won't do certain things with your software is---or,
at least should be---as unenforceable as promise to your doctor
that you won't smoke another cigarette.  The important point
is not, however, that click-through agreements are probably
unenforceable; the important point is that people---at least
those people who think that they own their own computers and
the software copies that they have purchased---generally
believe that they should be unenforceable.  (And in the
actual case involving Linux and DVD players there was no
agreement not to circumvent the technological control measures
in DVD's; the case was based on the theory that the circumvention
violated the Digital Millenium Copyright Act.)

I don't think that one should confuse contract limitations, or limitations on enforceable contract limitations, with technological
limitations.  There is nothing, for example, in any legal system that
forbids one from violating the law of gravity.
One of the many problems with the use of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act to enforce the technological control measures
in DVD's was that it was based on the rather weird theory
that it should be illegal to do something that someone
else tried, but failed, to make technologically impossible
to do.
(Thus I am rather doubtful that Lessig's idea the everything is
code is useful for analytical, rather than rhetorical, purposes.)

I don't see why we should.  We don't hate the law of gravity
