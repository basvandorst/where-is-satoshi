@_subject: Advanced Deanonymization Attacks 
A number of advanced deanonymization attacks. These do not just apply to
Whonix, but any anonymity system. Some are also general security issues.
Rather than exploiting bugs in the hypervisor to break out, some of
these attacks rely on the design of the underlying hardware to bypass
privilege separation boundaries and extract (or leak) sensitive
information to the network. No need for alarm, there are many
qualifications to this and details in the listed tickets on proposed
countermeasures. We are interested in cooperation to better assess the
performance impact of the planned fixes.
