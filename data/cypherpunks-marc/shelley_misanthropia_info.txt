Same experience as Guido when trying to dl using Griffin's link.  (I

I accidentally cc'd the "other" Crypto list when replying to this email,
and got this hilarious response:
"Posting of your message titled "Re: Bounties"
has been rejected by the list moderator.  The moderator gave the
following reason for rejecting your request:
"Please edit this post and resubmit it after changing it to not be top

Your smug misassumptions are amusing, especially when you have no idea
what the fuck you are talking about.
Neither Gwen nor I are of the "post-facebook" generation.  I've been
online (meaning using the Internet, which pre-dates the Web by quite a
few years- in case you were unaware) since the mid-eighties, during the
time of monochrome screens and when telling someone to finger you
wouldn't garner snickers from mental midgets like you.
You completely missed the point of Gwen's post, in which he clearly
talks about breaking 'the rules' to stir up idiots such as yourself, and
to which you still felt the need to make a whiny reply- to make yourself
feel, what...clever?  To give yourself some sense of faux cypherpunks
cred?  You're not impressing anyone, you just made yourself look a
fucking idiot with no reading comprehension.
Shut the fuck up and keep your stupid ASSumptions to yourself.

Jim, it did post to the list the first time.  This has happened to me
before, as well:  I've received an off-list reply from someone to a
message (sent only to the list) long before I saw it post on the list. There is often a delay and I'm not sure why; I'll look at the path in
headers the next time it happens.
