@_subject: Free set of Titleist 690 CB Irons! 
The Forged 690.CB irons provide playability and flighted performance through a progressive weight shelf design. Low weighted long irons are easier to hit and fly with a higher trajectory. Neutral weighting in the mid irons provides conventional trajectory. Traditionally shaped, higher weighted short irons are easy to knock down. A slightly wider sole with a blunted leading edge, moderate camber and a strong bounce angle asset provide outstanding performance in a variety of turf conditions. Forged from 1025 mild carbon steel with a bright chrome finish and traditional black paintfill, the Forged 690.CB irons provide classic good looks, solid feel and outstanding playability.
