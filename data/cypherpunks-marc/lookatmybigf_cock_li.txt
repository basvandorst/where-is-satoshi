Social interactions influence our thoughts, opinions and actions. In
this paper, social interactions are studied within a group of
individuals composed of influential social leaders and followers. Each
person is assumed to maintain a social state, which can be an emotional
state or an opinion. Followers update their social states based on the
states of local neighbors, while social leaders maintain a constant
desired state. Social interactions are modeled as a general directed
graph where each directed edge represents an influence from one person
to another. Motivated by the non-local property of fractional-order
systems, the social response of individuals in the network are modeled
by fractional-order dynamics whose states depend on influences from
local neighbors and past experiences.  A decentralized influence method
is then developed to maintain existing social influence between
individuals (e.g., without isolating peers in the group) and to
influence the social group to a common desired state (e.g., within a
convex hull spanned by social leaders). Mittag-Leffler stability methods
are used to prove asymptotic stability of the networked fractional-order
