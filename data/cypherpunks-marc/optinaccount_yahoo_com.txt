DHS CLUB OPPORTUNITY
My name is Caroline Gainer and I would like to share a genuine, NO RISK opportunity with you. Skeptical already? Good! Unlike other internet opportunities that you might have seen, what I have to share with you invites close scrutiny - even with a skeptical eye. It is first and foremost a CONSUMER OPPORTUNITY.
It also offers you the ability to have a share of a new Internet Mall to buy at wholesale for yourself or to send others to and make commissions on their purchases. Besides this, it also offers a unique and innovative networking program using a principle we call "REFERNET" Marketing. No hyped "pie in the sky" program or "get rich quick" scheme, but rather a credible and realistic way to save money and gradually develop what can become a large, recurring residual income. The best thing about this opportunity? You can "try it before you buy it". That's right. You can join the DHS Club for FREE with no risk or obligation. As a DHS Club Member, you will be able to shop at The DHS Club Outlet Center, where shipping is always included in the price of the merchandise. You will also be able to shop at The ClubShop Stores, located in the ClubShop Mall, where you will receive rebates on your purchases as per our affinity agreements. You will also be able be entered into Postlaunch and receive a FREE position in the Club's network. Watch as others join your downline and see how our innovative network building program works.

Caroline Gainer
