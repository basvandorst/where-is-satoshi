That is a problem between NSA, which recommended a person, and the
person recommended by NSA.

Hint: I'm not talking about a way to have perfect security. I'm talking
about possible/good/recommended approach to improve the security without
witch hunting.
Feel free to hunt witches if you think it necessary.

No hunting necessary to fire those agents who are hired at the
request of NSA/CIA.
It is also reasonable to fire those who are hired by the agents,

According to Snowden, there are government agents at key
positions for managing security.
When they declare the private circuits are secure, no one
else in the companies can argue against.
Unless they are fired and all the backdoors installed by
them are removed, neither Yahoo and Google are secure.
