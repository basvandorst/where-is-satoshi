 "quantum mathematics and physics doesn't provide food and warmth and genuine human connection," note that quantum mechanics has made advanced communications and medical technology possible. In the course of an anarchist revolution, one would expect that steps would be taken to ensure that the benefits of these technologies could be accessible to people everywhere, not abandoned along with intrinsically harmful products of twentieth-century science like nuclear weapons.
Regarding space travel, I think it's very important. Living in harmony with nature is great, but nature doesn't stop at the edge of the atmosphere.
I also don't see why the aerospace industry couldn't be reorganized in an anarchist manner. The most advanced aircraft being produced today, and even a growing number of prototype spacecraft, are made by tiny companies and work teams.
In any case, if we don't have a post-revolutionary space program the whole planet's fucked the next time a big rock comes our way.

Okay, although this is fun to debate, honestly, we can't say what will or won't happen in the supposed anarchist future. I honestly think that certain technologies will continue to be developed through a freeing of scientists to focus on those technologies which will ultimately benefit humankind. Bomb technology is not something that people will develop through their own But regardless. Our struggle is to encourage people to dissolve power and return it to the hands of humanity. What people do with that power is out of our hands. It is very important that people are critical of all decisions made via direct democracy and anarchy, but we will be powerless to stop it, if ultimately, that is what people choose.
Now, I have enough faith in humanity that people will not come to a consensus which destroys humanity. This is why I'm comfortable with anarchy, and what anarchist societies will ultimately do with technology.

Davis Imprisonment has become the response of first resort to far too many of the social problems that burden people who are ensconced in poverty. These problems often are veiled by being conveniently grouped together under the category "crime" and by the automatic attribution of criminal behavior to people of color. Homelessness, unemployment, drug addiction, mental illness, and illiteracy are only a few of the problems that disappear from public view when the human beings contending with them are relegated to cages. Prisons thus perform a feat of magic. Or rather the people who continually vote in new prison bonds and tacitly assent to a proliferating network of prisons and jails have been tricked into believing in the magic of imprisonment. But prisons do not disappear problems, they disappear human beings. And the practice of disappearing vast numbers of people from poor, immigrant, and racially marginalized communities has literally become big business. The seeming effortlessness of magic always conceals an When prisons disappear human beings in order to convey the illusion of solving social problems, penal infrastructures must be created to accommodate a rapidly swelling population of caged people. Goods and services must be provided to keep imprisoned populations alive. Sometimes these populations must be kept busy and at other times -- particularly in repressive super-maximum prisons and in INS detention centers -- they must be deprived of virtually all meaningful activity. Vast numbers of handcuffed and shackled people are moved across state borders as they are transferred from one state or federal prison to another. All this work, which used to be the primary province of government, is now also performed by private corporations, whose links to government in the field of what is euphemistically called "corrections" resonate dangerously with the military industrial complex.

The Death Penalty for Corporations Comes of Age
By Russell Mokhiber
Business Ethics
November 1, 1998
In two surprising recent cases, a law school professor and a circuit court judge seek to revoke the charters of corporate lawbreakers.
We know what the death penalty for individuals means: Commit an egregious crime, die at the hands of the state. What does it mean to talk about the ''death penalty'' for corporations?
More Inc..."On September 10, he and a coalition of more than 30 public interest organizations filed a petition calling on the attorney general (AG) of California to revoke the charter of Union Oil of California (Unocal). In social responsibility circles, Unocal is best (or perhaps worst) known for its controversial Burma pipeline, being built by a consortium co-owned in part by Unocal and the outlaw military regime there. For construction of the pipeline, the Burmese regime has reportedly seized land, forcibly relocated villages, and used unpaid labor -- even of children and the elderly. Benson's petition cites many other outrages as well -- including ''unspeakable'' human rights violations in Unocal's dealings with the Taliban militia in Afghanistan, which is known for its extreme cruelty in treatment of women; plus responsibility for the 1969 oil blowout in the Santa Barbara Channel; in addition to hundreds of other environmental and employee-safety violations. Noting that California routinely puts out of business hundreds of unruly accountants, lawyers, and doctors every year, the coalition called upon California Attorney General Dan Lungren (who is running for Governor) to revoke Unocal's charter.
''We're letting the people of California in on a well-kept secret,'' said Benson. ''The people mistakenly assume that we have to try to control these giant corporate repeat offenders one toxic spill at a time, one layoff at a time, one human rights violation at a time. But the law has always allowed the attorney general to go to court to simply dissolve a corporation for wrongdoing and sell its assets to others who will operate in the public In California, this power of charter revocation has apparently been invoked only once this century -- in 1976, when a conservative Republican AG asked a court to dissolve a private water company for allegedly delivering impure water to its customers..."And...the AG sought to revoke the charters of two corporations that put out allegedly deceptive ''scientific'' research for the tobacco industry.

Protest Olympic Uniforms Made in Burma
Source: American Anti-Slavery Group and Free Burma Coalition
Posted: February 21, 2002
BOSTON, MA (February 3, 2002) -- The American Anti-Slavery Group (AASG) and the Free Burma Coalition (FBC) today announced a campaign of protest over the fact that parts of the 2002 Winter Olympic Torchbearer uniforms were made in Burma.
The international community has repeatedly condemned Burma's military regime for employing a brutal system of forced labor. Burmese soldiers routinely conscript villagers to work on construction projects, carry supplies, or even sweep for landmines. Many of the victims are beaten or raped; none are paid for their labor.
In 1998, the International Labor Organization (ILO) called the system of forced labor in Burma "a saga of untold misery and suffering."
"Every purchase of a made-in-Burma product supports this regime," explained AASG's David Moore. Responding to the pro-democracy movement inside Burma, numerous companies, governments, and unions have cut ties with Burma. "Everyone else is getting out of Burma -- and with good reason," added Moore. "The International Olympic Committee (IOC) should follow suit."
Ironically, AASG staffers first learned about this development when escaped Sudanese slave Francis Bok donned his uniform to carry the Olympic torch past historic Plymouth Rock.
Over a thousand on-line activists have already lodged complaints with the Historically, the IOC has functioned above politics, but in extreme cases -- such as the banning of South Africa from the games during the Apartheid era

1894 -- Marius Monfray dies in Lyons. French anarchist & trade unionist. In November 1886, he was given eight days in prison for organizing an illegal lottery (in support for Bordat during the "Trial of the 66").

In the meantime, Camillo Berneri had been preparing an 'attentat' on Alfredo Rocco &endashthe man behind the infamous Rocco Penal Code &endash during his Brussels visit. Menapace arranged it so that Berneri would be arrested in Belgium, in possession of a pistol & some photographs of the Minister of Justice, Rocco. So, he was captured & Menapace returned to Rome. In court on 22nd February 1930, Berneri's friends were acquitted, but he himself was sentenced to six months in prison, while Menapace was sentenced 'in absentia' to two years, since it was accepted that he instigated the whole Once back on the other side of the Franco-Belgian border, Berneri went through a second trial for the same events & was sentenced to a year & two months. He was given amnesty on 14th July 1931 & expelled from the country, but, as he had already been declared undesirable ('persona non grata') in the surrounding countries, Berneri was again able to stay in Paris.

@_subject: `Anarcho-sexism' Free women of Spain and E.Goldman.(book reviews) 
"Two recently published books discuss important questions about the historical relationship between anarchism and feminism. Martha Ackelsberg's Free Women of Spain examines the difficult development of an anarchist- feminist current within and alongside established anarchist and anarcho- syndicalist institutions. Following protracted debates, an independent strand of anarcho-feminism emerged in 1936 in the form of the Mujeres libres.[1] Emma Goldman, by Bonnie Haaland, discusses the political implications of Goldman's feminist interpretation of anarchist thought.[2] Her research identifies the unusual nature of Goldman's feminism: sharply critical of suffrage-orientated feminism, curiously and explicitly heterosexual in her sexual politics, but also forthright and eloquent in her assertion of women's rights and her critique of patriarchal oppression. Both these works significantly develop our knowledge of the anarchists' sexual politics, and help correct some of the flaws which have marked previous In this paper, I will develop ideas and debates initiated by these works,and so present a more wide-ranging survey of the relationship between the two traditions. It must be stressed that my aim is not to present an apology for, or denial of the confused and often disappointing response by anarchists to the development of feminism. `Anarcho-sexism' was a real and powerful force; it was a strong influence on many anarchist theorists and organizations, and it stunted much anarchist thought. However, it is too easy merely to register its existence: in this article I will examine in detail the structures and concepts within anarchist political culture which permitted and even encouraged the development of such attitudes. Having noted these limitations within anarchist thinking, it is then essential to qualify the perception of anarchism as inherently patriarchal by noting the existence of rival currents.
Surprisingly, there is evidence to suggest the growth of some lively proto-feminist, even fully feminist, currents within anarchism. Thus, the subject of this article can be seen as a double paradox: firstly the paradox that the anarchists, so proud of their anti-authoritarianism, of their sceptical analysis of power structures, of their real ability to challenge the dominant political cultures of the nineteenth century, were yet so blind to the existence of gender-based tyrannies. Our second paradox is that within this tough, masculine culture, there nonetheless developed a proto-feminist strand.A secondary objective is to move towards a redefinition of the anarchist political culture. To do this, we will examine a wide range of sources, taking note of the `classical' anarchist tradition represented by Godwin, Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin, but also investigating lesser-known writers and thinkers.[4] While this article is too short to permit a full comparison with the sexual politics of the socialist tradition, some suggestions will be made to sketch out the differences between the two movements. The article will conclude by making some proposals for further research.
Material for discussion will be drawn from across the traditions of European anarchism, with some centrality being given to the two peaks of anarchist political culture: the radical debates of the French political avant-garde during the fin-de-siècle, and the mass political movement created by anarcho-syndicalists in twentieth-century Spain. Most of the primary material cited will be drawn from `the anarchist century' the hundred years between the publication of Proudhon's What is Property? in 1840, and the defeat of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) in Spain in 1939. To present a full discussion of these issues one would wish to examine them in the context of a grass-roots style social history of anarchist movements and of the milieus in which they flourished.[5] The focus presented here is somewhat narrower: a `textual' analysis, based on nothing more than a close reading of a wide range of anarchist and semi-anarchist works, and a survey of the critical literature on anarchism. The question of the relation of these texts to the lived experience of the anarchist milieu has not been addressed: I have worked on the assumption that these texts do have some meaningful and central relation to the anarchist movement, even if they do not reflect all its nuances.[6]...."

Longish (from  International Campaign to Free Ali Khalid Abdullah c/o Pushing Forward 2716 SE 21st Street Portland, OR 97202, USA freeali (503) 232-5817 (ask for Todd) Ali Khalid Abdullah, a New Afrikan political prisoner has been unjustly labelled a "suspected security threat" and "suspected terrorist" by the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC.)
These accusations came at the same time as Ali's sudden transfer from the Thumb Correctional Facility to another state-level prison.
Since his incarceration in 1990, Ali has devoted nearly all of his spare time to improving the lives of himself and those around him. Among other things, he has run an anti-drug program for fellow prisoners, earned a Bachelors degree, and produced dozens of conscious pamphlets distributed the world over. Despite his many positive efforts, he has been denied parole five times and subject to unfair treatment on numerous occasions.
The latest case of this unfair treatment began on February 12. A question arose in the prison mail room at the Thumb Correctional Facility, as to whether Ali should be allowed to receive a leaflet mailed from Puerto Rico containing slogans such as "Smash Sexism." It was eventually decided that he should be allowed to receive it.
Shortly after, he was subjected to an unusual and unexplained cell search, in which many of his letters, literature, and photographs where confiscated.
Later that evening, he was called to the Control Center at the prison and was given "a notice of intent to conduct an administrative hearing." The notice indicated what materials were confiscated and stated that Ali was "a suspected security threat, [indicated by] group literature and photographs depicting possible terrorist activity, [and] uprising against institutions and government [and] organized from several countries."
During this type of hearing, a prisoner is evaluated, and if deemed a threat to security, then she/he is reclassified to a higher prison level and is transferred to that level. In many cases, prisoners are transferred to federal prisons. Ali is at risk of being formally charged by the state, with the FBI headquarters and the US Justice Department being notified.
An hour after receiving this notice, Ali was told to "pack up and get ready to be transferred." The next day(February 13) he was moved to Kinross Correctional Facility, a state-run institution in Kincheloe, Michigan.
These events are highly disturbing and suspicious. They occurred shortly after Ali's 6th parole hearing on February 7, which had given him a level of optimism at first. Abdullah had a good record at the Thumb Correctional Facility, and prior to these incidents had no reason to believe that he had done anything to upset the authorities there.
These incidents are also, of course, being carried out within the context of the U.S. government's current "War on Terrorism", which in addition to bringing carnage on Afghanistan, is being used as a pretext for clamp-downs on human rights, and officially-sanctioned prejudice within the US. Shortly after September 11, Abdullah was interrogated on the basis of his name and his faith. Similarly, his treatment over the past week is likely a product of the bigoted attitudes and policies coming to light in recent months.
The International Campaign to Free Ali Khalid Abdullah is calling on all concerned people to support him as best as they can. All those who criticize the so-called "War on Terrorism," racism and the prison system have a chance to turn their words into concrete, productive actions by having Ali's back in this time of need.
Despite such unfair treatment, Ali has remained committed to his work for positive social change. Now, he needs your help to clear his name and get these charges dropped so he can move on to winning his freedom and continuing with his work.
At this point, we are asking everyone to write to the MDOC Officials listed below; and those with steady jobs to send some financial aid to Ali (c/o the campaign). In addition to the usual legal and living expenses, his money is still at the previous jail and won't reach him for up to a month.
Attached is a form letter designed to help Ali fight these unfounded charges. Please edit it to fit your own circumstances, and mail it to the list of addresses below. This will show the prison officials that people around the world know the facts about Ali, and are driven to support him. We need the highest level of public attention on this case as possible, to prevent any further persecution of Ali.
All that said, please know that this is a very sensitive situation and we need to proceed carefully. This is NOT the time to be hostile and confrontational. The goal here is to prove that Ali is not a terrorist threat and to get him free, not to confront prison officials on their issues. Any anger or political rhetoric would only be used as further evidence against Ali.
"These moments are very precious & we are under determined pressure & peril by these people  thus to overcome this ill need maximum effort and support," says Ali. "State your complaint, concerted concern and push for clearing my name and this sudden suspicion off of me with tact!"
Letters or e-mails of support can be sent to Ali in care of the campaign: International Campaign to Free Ali Khalid Abdullah, 2716 SE 21st Street Portland, OR 97202, USA. freeali
For reasons described above, please refrain from sending anything with "anarchy" or similar logos until this matter is corrected.

              Black Oyster Infoshop: Williamsburg
              This is a great opportunity for us, because we
              recently formed. We'd like to offer a free and
              alternative forum for various events in
              Williamsburg, Virginia such as poetry readings,
              discussions, film presentations, and later offer
              anarchist and other radical literature. Our
              address is Black Oyster Infoshop 206 South
              Boundary Street Williamsburg, VA 23187 We
              want to offer a free forum for progressive issues
              and events, as well as attempt to build a
              community solidarity with labor or other groups.
              We plan to have alternative and anarchist
              literature available. For now we are more event
              oriented.

the good word first hand from argentina:
i just had a wonderful time hitching
through a 150km section of northern argentina which is controled by
activists who have kicked the police and army out. The piqueteros are
amazing. They've used non-violent direct action to liberate a town of
30,000 people, shutdown oil refineries, and generally kick ass. Also down
here the workers have started taking over and running the factories
themsleves without bosses or the owners. Also they have all these directly
democratic assemblies which are coordinating all the protests against teh
economic system, but also they want to scrap represnentivie democracy. Now
i-m in bolivia working on starting an imc here... :)
Even if the US is fucked up there are some amazing things happening in
south america. Who knows if it will become a revolution, but it's the
closest thing i've ever seen to one.
