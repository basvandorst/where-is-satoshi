Dear friend,
I know it's quite astonishing when a business proposal comes from an unknown person whom you do not know or have in anyway come in contact
 with.I got your email address when browsing through the internet so I decided to contact you.,I solicit for your understanding and co-operation in this Transaction that will be benefit to both of us. I am from Sierra Leone in West Africa,son of a diamond merchant, but presently residing in the Netherlands{political asylum} due to the unstable political situation in my country.My proposal to you is,I have Brilliantly and quietly transferred my capital which involves a very reasonable amount through a Diplomatic means which I safely deposited with a security company in exchange to pay a very high interest rates. I will be willing to invest this fund in your country, of course with your assistance once I can trust you.I have also decided to give you some percentage of the total sum if you are able to assist me on the areas of investment in this transaction.As I have practical reasons for not investing in the Netherlands where I reside at the moment. It might interest you to know that this transaction is 100% risk free for both parties.Hence all modalities for efficient security,safety and successful transaction have been
arranged. So please feel free to contact me through this e-mail address, j_bagora or call me on phone number 0031-629 282 009 so that we can talk elaborately.Thanks and looking forward to your swift Best Regards, James Bagora
