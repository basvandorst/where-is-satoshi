Funny. I would have said exactly the opposite: public key crypto is much better understood because it is based on mathematical theorems and reductions to (admittedly presumed) hard problems, whereas symmetric crypto is really a black art that mixes some simple bit wise operations and hopes for the best (yes, I know this is a bit of caricature...)

I share that belief. Hence my desire to fully understand Bruce's remark.
Strictly speaking you need some kind of security relationship: you need to be sure the public key belongs to the intended recipient (and is under his sole control). So public key crypto allows you to bootstrap from some authentic piece of information (public key belongs to X) to a confidential communication channel (with X).

You have the same issues with nonces, counters, etc. with symmetric crypto so I don't see how that makes it preferable over public key crypto.
