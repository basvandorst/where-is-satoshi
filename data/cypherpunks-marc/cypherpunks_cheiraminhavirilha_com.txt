if a company can not fix an issue in 90 days, they should not be  writing software.
+1 for google, this 90 days policy also prevents m$ feeding 3-letters  agencies with 0-days.

Can someone using this Russians ISPs being monitored / DPI'd, paste  some traffic logs?
Or install the firefox plugin and say if it detects the redirect URLs

It remembers me about Phorm at UK, BR, some other countries also.
There is a firefox addon to detect / scramble / block this kind of  redirects URLs, generating random unique IDs to throw garbage on the  data the ISP collects.
But seems its not open source.

@_subject: BitTorrent, VPS and no DMCA 
just had found being able to run a torrent seed box (in a medium  bandwidth VPS, cheap) without getting DMCA requests, restarting daemon  every 240 seconds - new randomized port on each restart. Using Deluge  as torrent program and 8 lines of bash script to do the restart job.
i forgot the restart script once and, next day, DMCA arrived. didnt  bothered to found the optimal value since 240 seconds is ok for my  any other experiences?

From page 18 of paper  'The disk is targeted by a specific serial number and reprogrammed by  a series of ATA commands.
For example, in the case of Seagate drives, we see a chain of  commands: âFLUSH CACHEâ (E7) â
âDOWNLOAD MICROCODEâ (92) â âIDENTIFY DEVICEâ (EC) â WRITE âLOG EXTâ  (3F). Depending on the reflashing request, there might be some unclear  data manipulations written to the drive using âWRITE LOG EXTâ (3F)'
This 3-letters-agency did it with software, mostly using undocumented  ATA commands.
A software approach would reach a larger audience, assuming not  everyone knows eletronics and/or can pull his/her HDD off.
Assuming no one knows the specifications for the ATA commands, or has  the time/knowledge/samples to analyze and reverse engineer it, a  request of such a tool for the Kaspersky guys seems the best approach.

@_subject: IMEI changed - any RTL-SDR sniff way to check it was properly changed? 
Due to the recent events envolving planes and FBI, I was wondering.  Changing SIMs (so IMSI) is an easy task. Change IMEI with some  knowledge I believe its too.
There are some tutorials on IMEI changing on rooted android, I dont  known if actually works, suppose yes:
Knowing we can get TMSI / IMSI (sometimes) via RTL-SDR software +  proper dongles:
And knowing the IMEI is used / exchanged with the network before  authentication is granted to a certain phone (network can block IMEIs,  so they are sent/exchanged)
Do someone know if is it possible to check if the original IMEI was  really changed and is not being exchanged with the provider, by using  RTL-SDR + proper device to sniff the frequency?

agreed. if it comes in the form of help/fund/fork of open source  software, better.
