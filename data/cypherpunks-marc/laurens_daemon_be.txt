The major ISPs of Belgium were forced to block certain sites starting in 2009. The list of blocked websites is secret (except for the gambling sites blocked due to regulatory issues with the Belgian gaming commission). The blocked sites can be categorized as:
- websits containing child porn
- child porn whistleblowing sites (long story)
- Regulatory issues with the gaming commission (this list is public)
- Piracy related (The Pirate Bay amongst others)
- Webshops selling illegal medicine and other forbidden products
I've been trying to uncover this list here: Basically, DNS requests for those websites are redirected to a government controlled webserver.
What other techniques are there (besides checking every site on the internet) to try and uncover whether sites are blocked in Belgium?

How would you monitor, maintain & troubleshoot administration & security issues on your servers if you do not have logs? Or are you talking about retention of said logs?
