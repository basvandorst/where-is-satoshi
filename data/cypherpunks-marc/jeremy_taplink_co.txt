Just an aside...
The 1BTC bountry John references below is a 1BTC P2SH output, where the  redeemScript he provided does hash to the expected value, and is itself a  2-of-3 multisig, with the following pubkeys, expressed as addresses:
By comparison, the signatories for the 4BTC bountry are:
On the one hand, the vanity address makes it easy to guess who one of the  signatories is, on the other hand, is it bad form to reuse keys for  John, you mentioned wanting to disambiguate bounties, perhaps through a  bounty-specific pubkey. I'm not sure I follow, how is that better than  just referencing the address of the output, or the TxID, in a 'Table of  Bounties'? Or you want to embed a hash of your signed message announcing  the bounty?
Out of curiosity, I suppose right now you just keep pubkeys for the  signatories you want to appoint and reuse the same pubkey to create these  multi-sigs, or you have to ask for a new one each time?
 From the signatories perspective, I imagine we're a long way off from a  wallet receiving or importing the p2sh, tracking that these outputs as  "yours", and even more, which contract/bounty they correspond to, and  finally a usable way to accumulate signatures and ultimately spend the  output to the bounty winner.
And of course, thanks for posting the bounties!

Same mechanism for both, of course. Sorry, that was obvious. :)

Really interesting work. When using scan-to-pay, after the payer scans the  QR code with the protobuf PaymentRequest (not a URL to download the  PaymentRequest) are they using their own connectivity to submit the  Payment response?
If we assume connectivity on the phone, might as well just get a URL from  the QR code and re-use existing infrastructure for serving that?
How about putting a Bluetooth address in the payment_url inside the  PaymentDetails message for the smartphone to send back the Payment  response and get PaymentAck?
