G'ive up:  In some Government offices the clerks, upon arrival in the morning, have to
sign their names in an "attendance book". This book provides space for
signature, time of arrival, and "remarks." Ten minutes after the hour and
official draws a red line under the last arrival's name, and all those
coming subsequently are expected to furnish an explanation of their
tardiness in the "remarks" column.When a real "London particular" occurs the
 "Delayed by
fog," and the rest scribble a "ditto".One morning -- a foggy one -- Mr.
Jones became a proud father; but even this only caused him to be about
eleven minutes late. Proudly he wrote in explanation: "Wife had twins,"
which was followed in due course by the usual string of "ditto's".
A woman has twins, and gives them up for adoption. One of them goes to a
family in Egypt, and is named "Amal." The other goes to a family in Spain;
they name him "Juan."Years later, Juan sends a picture of himself to his
mom. Upon receiving the picture, she tells her husband that she wishes she
also had a picture of Amal. Her husband responds, "But they are twins--if
you've seen Juan, you've seen Amal."
