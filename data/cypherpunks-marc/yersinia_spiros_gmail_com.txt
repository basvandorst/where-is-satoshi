IMHO I found related to this discussion this article on LWN (
, which describes the developments in the recent years on the generation of
random numbers in the linux kernel. In particular, it discusses the talk
"Do not Play Dice With Random Numbers" by Peter Alvin at LinuxCon Europe
2012 (
 )
"Randomness is a subtle property. To illustrated this, Peter displayed a
photograph of three icosahedral says That He'd thrown at home, saying"
here, if you need a random number, you can use 846. "Why does not this work
, he asked. First of all, a random number is only random ounces. Additions
in, it is only random until we know what it is. These facts are not the
same thing. Peter Noted That It is possible to misuse by a random number
reusing it, this can lead to breaches in security protocols."

Yes, I had noticed your post on FD. In my opinion you are right,
the value that is compared can come from the outside.
It would be the same problem that is discussed (also) here. Perhaps
the solution might look like
the same.
