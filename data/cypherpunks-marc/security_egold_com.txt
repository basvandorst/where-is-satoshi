Dear E-Gold User!
Net scammers under the name of E-Gold users send many fraud messages!
PLEASE BE ADVISED E-GOLD WILL NEVER SEND YOU AN HTML EMAIL WITH A HYPERTEXT
LINK ASKING YOU TO CLICK ON THE LINK TO ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT!
There are numerous fraudulent emails in circulation spoofing e-mail
addresses in the e-gold.com domain. These emails direct you to
log into your account to verify information or update information
and they usually operate on greed or fear in order to entice victims
to click a hypertext link.
These emails may say your account has a value limit, you have
received fraudulent funds, your account will be closed for inactivity,
or that e-gold is paying monthly interest payments.
Regardless of the subject line of the fraudulent emails, they always
have one thing in common. The hypertext link in the email will appear
to be to the e-gold website, but if clicked, it directs the victim
to a fraudulent website, designed to ensnare the careless by mimicking
the appearance of the real e-gold website. The technique used to
obscure the true destination of such hypertext links is via the
use of HTML formatted e-mail.
The ultimate goal of the criminal is to entice his victims to enter
their e-gold account number and passphrase while on the fraudulent
website. Once the criminal has gained this information, he has
everything he needs to log in to the victim's e-gold account
on the real e-gold website and divert the value.
We urge Users to:
1 Never click hypertext links in HTML formatted e-mail to access your account.
2 Confirm that you are on the e-gold website before entering your e-gold
passphrase into either a logon form or a payment authorization form
(see note below about e-gold shopping cart interface):
  -  Verify the address/location/URL starts with:   -  Verify the site is secure (look at the SSL Lock icon at the bottom of your browser window)
  -  Verify that the site certificate is issued by VeriSign to E-Gold Shopping Cart Interface (SCI)
Merchant sites using the e-gold SCI will pass you to the e-gold website
at checkout to authorize payment. The e-gold SCI will pass you back to
the Merchant's site after you have received confirmation of your e-gold
Spend. All of the above criteria for verifying you are on the e-gold
website also apply to Spends made via the e-gold SCI.
