@_subject: [Cryptography][Law] Jeremy Hammond Banned from using Cryptography 
Can any of you, most of whom I do not doubt are far more knowledgeable
about cryptography and how it's conceptualised within the legal sphere,
offer some insight regarding this?
The claim is that Judge Loretta A. Preska, who sentenced Jeremy Hammond
today, said that for the three years (post-release) that he was to spend
under supervision, he will not be able to use encryption for communication
or storage purposes(!) which is practically a legal edict to go and build a
cabin by Walden Pond. How can this be considered anything but cruel and
