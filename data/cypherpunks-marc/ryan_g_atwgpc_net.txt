Carpathia to store content. They have over 1,000 servers and more than 525
of them are located in Virginia with Carpathia. They were paying Cogent
around $1 million a month for bandwidth or hosting services.
The U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., ordered the seizure of 18
domain names associated with the alleged Mega conspiracy.
