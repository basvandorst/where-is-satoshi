Dear Partner,
You may be suprised to received this letter from me since you do not know
me personally.
I am Zokolu Zabuanga the first son of Kuanzo Zabuanga ,the most popular
farmer in zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country.I got
your contact through network online hence deceided to write you.
Before the death of my father he had taken me to johannesburg to deposite
the sum of 12.000000.00 dollars (twelve million dollars)in one of the
private security company in South Africa, as he foresaw the looming danger
in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid much
dumorrage from the security company, this amount was meant for the purchase
of new machines and chemicals for farms and establishment of new farms in
This land problem came when Zimbabwean president.Mr Robert Mugabe introduced
a new land act reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some black
farmers,and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabweean war
veterans and some lunatics in the society.
Infact a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which
my father was one of the victims and may his soul rest in perfect peace.
It is against this background that i and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear of
our lives and are currently staying in the Nederlands where i am seeking for
asylum and moreso have deceided to trasfer my father's money to a more
reliable foreign account since the law of the Nederlands prohibits a refugee
(asylum seeker) to open a bank account or to involve in any financial
transaction throughout the territorial zone of the Nederlands,as the eldelst
son of my father,I am saddled with the responsibilt of seeking a genuine
foreign account where this money could be transferd without the knowledge of
my goverment who are bent on taking everything we have got.
The south African government seems to be playing along with them,i am faced
with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear
of going through the same experience in future,both countries have similar
political history and as a business man i am seeking for a partner who i
have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands,i must let you
know that this transcation is risk free,if you accept to assit me and my
family,all i want you to do for me is to make arrangements with security
company to clear the consignment (funds)from their afilate office here in
the Nederlands as i have already giving dirctives for the consignments to be
brought to the Nederlands from South Africa but before then all modalities
will be put in place like the change of ownership to the consignment
(funds)and more importantly this money i intend to use for investments.
I have two options for you,firstly you can choose to have certain percentage
of the money for nominating your account for this transaction ,or you can go
into partnership with me for a proper profitable investment of the money in
your country,which ever the option you want please feel free to notify me,i
have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kind of expences incurred in
this process of this transaction.
If you do not prefer a partnership i am willing to give you 15% of the total
sum while the remaning 80% will be for me and my family also for the
investment in your country.Contact me with the above email address while i
implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction
till we put claims to the consignment (funds).
Thanking you,and GOD bless you.
Your's Truely ,
Zokolu Zabuanga.
