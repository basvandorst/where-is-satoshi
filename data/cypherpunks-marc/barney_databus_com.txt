So it's ok to declare war on Hezbollah but not on ISIS?  If I decide to
build my own WMD I'm a criminal but if Pakistan fails to prosecute the
guy who helps me then I'm an enemy combatant?
Seems to me the criterion should be the level of the threat, not fine
distinctions on who's making it.

The problem arises when money paid for drugs, for example, or kiddie porn,
finds its way to finance terrorists.  Or when we are told that it does,
whether or not that is so.  And a sufficiently successful criminal
enterprise is indeed a national security threat.
