... delayed response
 > From: Peter Gutmann
I am working on a linux distribution that is using the hardware RNG for
seeding/rng in number of things (IPSEC, ssh, ssl, gpg, etc) and this is
definitely the angle I am excited about.
A 1Ghz proc goes a long way, but in a media intensive system (video,
audio, streaming over wireless) you want to keep CPU load as light as
possible so that latency is minimal.
With the C5P you can now do VPN with AES, rng via the hardware entropy,
and video offload via the CLE266.  This leaves the CPU free to handle
various interrupts for the wireless network, disk i/o, etc.
Very nice move, I think.
I have written some poor code and info regarding the C5XL (nehemiah)
and linux:
    [ I'll be cleaning code up and releasing new patches/srcs soon ]
A lot of peer networking applications use SHA digests for securely
identifying resources in a network.  The overhead of this for large
volumes of content will make this a welcome addition :-)
Also, Centaur indicated that with the SHA on die, they can produce
statistically perfect RNG output.  The von neumann whitener does let
a small bias through for very large data sets IIRC (i.e. a
statistical bias is detectable in 1G or more data)
If you are using the hardware rng via a user space daemon feeding
I am also curious about crypto-loop file system acceleration / CPU offload.
There are a number of uses I am anxious to try with this hardware.
Best regards,

I've been wondering why I havent seen more discussion on
wireless networking (802.11a/b/g) and anon/mix /dark nets.
Is this a subject of interest to anyone?  I am curious what
kinds of work has been done in this area...
A few examples:
- cryptographic dead drop or anonymous broadcast: wifi
  broadcasts with clients monitoring for tagged packets.
  Anonymous transport for a number of miles. (probably
  requires amps)
- (encrypted) wireless hops in a mix network for additional
  attack resistance, and/or all wireless (mesh?) routing.
Is the mapping of existing cryptographic techniques to
wireless transport straighforward and uninteresting, or
is there additional capabilities in a wireless envrionment
that open up new uses for secure and/or anonymous
