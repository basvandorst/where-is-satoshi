Osama Bin Laden has told the mass-circulation Dawn newspaper in Pakistan that his al-Qaeda group possesses chemical and nuclear weapons. But, while the English-language newspaper carries a clear message from Bin Laden that he has access to such weapons, he makes no such claim in an Urdu-language version of the interview.

'The Origins of Cryptology: The Arab contributions', by Ibrahim A Al-Kadi Cryptologia, volume 16, no 2 (April 1992), pages 97-126.
 A discussion of recently discovered Arab manuscripts.
Ever since man started communicating with one another, there has been a need to keep secrets. Cryptography is defined as the principles, means, and methods for rendering information unintelligible, and for restoring the encrypted information back into intelligible form. In other words, cryptography is the science of writing in secret. Examples of cryptography have been discovered in the writings of Egyptians over 4,000 years ago. The ancient Greek, Chinese, and Roman civilizations used surprisingly advanced cryptography techniques. The use of cryptography, and the analysis of cryptography (cryptoanalysis), flourished in the Arab world during the Middle Ages. While lovers and theologians have long made use of secret messages, the overwhelming use of secret writing has historically been in diplomacy and the military. The first big breakthrough in decipherment was made in the ninth century by the Arab philosopher al-Kindi in a treatise only recently rediscovered. For a thousand years or more, a message coded in a random monoalphabetic cipher was considered undecipherable unless one had the key to the code.
Remember, 'algorithm' and 'algebra' are Arabic in origin.

Several of the oldest cryptological (and cryptographic) texts were
written by Arab mathematicians. You should be able to find
references with Google.

If you live somewhere with access to a GSM or GPRS network, there
are many phones (I know of models from Ericsson and Nokia) that
have built in modems and can link with your laptop using IR.
Gnokii for Linus used to be able to manage this with Nokias.
Nokia 7110 and 6210 (at least) are capable.
