Hey, my name is Lisa.  I'm currently a freshman in college, and I think I'm going to be a psychology major, but who knows!
I'm on the girls tennis team and I signed up to be photo editor for our campus newspaper. I'm single at the moment cause the right guy hasn't come along yet!! Hopefully I'll meet him soon  :-)
I just got done browsing thru profiles online and i found yours!
I just got my webcam working so we can talk as long as you want at my website and it doesn't cost you anything if you wanna watch
or see me! Just visit my free chatroom Here!
I hope we get to meet soon... I'll wait for you ;-)
laters, Lisa
