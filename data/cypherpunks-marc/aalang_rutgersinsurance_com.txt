mistaken and spreading hatred through disinformation and false accusations,
which is resulting in death and miseries for number of innocent people
living around the world at the hands of merciless KILLER MUSLIMS and also
bringing bad name to MOHAMMED as Founder Of Islam.
the eyes of non-Muslims, please work for peace and reconciliation and prove
to the WORLD through your deeds that MOHAMMED teaches "love & peace" and not
Cruelty, Inhumanity and "Hatred & Killing" of the innocent civilians.
