Common carrier status for ISP's is not automatic, under the '96 Telecom Act and later additions. You have to file with the FCC and promise to remove material anybody complains about, etc. in exchange for indemnification from liablility.

What I find interesting is how we can have a war without a Congressional     declaration, which out of practical if not legal necessity requires something at least approximating a foreign power as the enemy. It would be extremely helpful if there were some overt state action or at least a smoking gun to publicly identify such party.
Bin Laden and crew are not a foreign power, unless we are stupid enough to turn them into one, a  hostile one. Sheer folly when their precise complicity and the extent of their involvement in the attacks has yet to   be demostrated outside of their self-promotion and our desire to find the guilty parties. Who, I don't believe, give a shit about the Islam rampant bs. except as expedient, and as much as about selecting the toll collectors for the pipelines to be built through places like Afghanistan to China, the former Soviet Republics, etc.
I don't rule out a war. There are grounds for it. That'll be folly, too, though, if we pick the wrong enemy, or support the wrong side again. Not speaking of Bin Laden now. Or cut another deal with a devil who'll bite us in the ass again a few years down the road. If not sooner. If we have to have Americans dying in remote, already blown-up, mine-laden poppy fields etc. as postulated, kindly let's not do it out of crass political expediency. Again. Nothing wrong with revenge for 5000+ dead, either, but don't let's get more killed going after the wrong motherfuckers, or trying to buy the right ones off.

What is this, Henry Kissinger's vanity website or something? It reads like one of his Nixon era State Dept. memos on Vietnam or some shit. Pure felgercarb.
No state worthy of the name, benevolent or oppressive, and in it's right mind, declares war with individuals, or abstract concepts, despite the dangerously deluded metaphors. Mr. Bin Laden must be flattered no end if he thinks that the U.S. reallly considers him personally, or even his entire organization, that much of a menace. Doubt he's that stupid, though.
That's not necessarily to say that military force is not going to be used, but even if a single judiciously placed CIA bullet could resolve the matter, and not just for the moment, it likely wouldn't have Bin Laden's name on it. Not for maximum effect, anyway. But, loose lips sink ships, etc. Plus, TV, newspapers, websites, etc.need circulation. Bin Laden is good copy. Hottest thing since O.J. Almost as hot as wallowing in the enormity of 5000+ dead, After a century which, as others on the list have pointed out, saw 100's of millions dead from war, famine, disease, state terror, etc. Ruwanda, Kosovo, Bosnia, etc, just in the last 5-6 years or so.

dict.org cites Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913):
War War, n. OE. & AS. werre; akin to OHG. werra scandal,
    quarrel, sedition, werran to confound, mix, D. warren, G.
    wirren, verwirren, to embroil, confound, disturb, and perhaps
    to E. worse; cf. OF. werre war, F. querre, of Teutonic
    origin. Cf. Guerrilla, Warrior.
    1. A contest between nations or states, carried on by force,
       whether for defence, for revenging insults and redressing
       wrongs, for the extension of commerce, for the acquisition
       of territory, for obtaining and establishing the
       superiority and dominion of one over the other, or for any
       other purpose; armed conflict of sovereign powers;
       declared and open hostilities.
             Men will ever distinguish war from mere bloodshed.
                                                   --F. W.
                                                   Robertson.
    Note: As war is the contest of nations or states, it always
          implies that such contest is authorized by the monarch
          or the sovereign power of the nation. A war begun by
          attacking another nation, is called an offensive war,
          and such attack is aggressive. War undertaken to repel
          invasion, or the attacks of an enemy, is called
          defensive.
This is not the definition used in the analysis, which references the much-bandied "war on terrorism". Granted that the English language is no longer what it was after nearly a century of concerted corruption through constant misuse  by all stripes of propagandists, disinformation artists, and damned liars, but any analysis that supplants shoddy analogies and metaphor for precise usage (and I'm wondering for what reason) is suspect. Also granted that this is what the politicians are touting, with only tangential suggestions of conflict with other states.
That's just for starters. It gets worse from there. Since that's the major premise of the article, though, I see no point in proceeding further.
Or like the way governments have got into the habit of placing individuals into roles formerly reserved for nations and states. They should be more careful about that. Sets a dangerous precedent, if you ask me.I don't think the idea is to acknowledge sovereign powers, either, incur an obligation to treat with, etc., but that's the inescapable conclusion. Better hope the sheep don't look up, huh?

Circuits work as expected, antennas work as expected, and there are no "unexplained observations" (as usually exist before a new theory arrives). There may be some _semantic_ issues, e.g., does a square wave or impulse "really" have components that were sent out _before_ the square wave or impulse? (A Fourier decomposition of a square wave starting at time t = 0 has "sine wave components" spread out over time and adding up in such a way as to give the square wave, or the impulse, or any other signal. Some think this means deep and mysterious things are happening, something having to do with time travel and reversing the aging process, blah blah Henning Harmuth may write fairly eloquently about the "dogma of the circle" and how  the Fourier decomposition of a signal into (allegedly) a near-infinite series of sine waves is "not real," but for all intents and purposes it all works. And the "new physics" people like Bearden go way beyond what Harmuth and Barrett are talking about: they bring in "curved space-time" and gravitation and antigravity and the ultra-weird notion that aging can be reversed by "pumping the conjugate time-axis of the Minkowski manifold" (OK, I made this up...don't have time to lift one of Bearden's direct quotes...and this will help train me in the jargon if I ever become a "new physicist.").
Nut cases like Bearden have the patter of physics down. Very few actual physicists waste their time dissecting and refuting Bearden for obvious Thanks for the references, which aren't familiar to me. I'll check them out.
I urge readers of this list not to waste time on this stuff.

I'm really gonna have set up some decent filtering. I'm subscribed to a couple of nodes, plus some nodes reply-to the list, others the sender. Replying to the list is more convenient for me, as I seldom send private   messages out of a list discussion. I do tend to think about the message more than the addressing, and  every so often I fire one off without looking.

Yes, that's what was throwing me, too, and why I couldn't reconcile 1,000,000 with the three segments. The connections to the other 297 nodes. This means you have 100 cycles for each segment. In an ordinary torus there's only one.
Am I wrong or isn't this just the hypercube anolog for a torus, that is, a hypertorus. If not I suppose you'd just have to call it a polycyclic It does provide a small diameter for such a large number of nodes.

Ok, somebody has to say this, and I wish it were a topologist,
mathematician, or somebody else working in the field, but it's not a
hypercube or cube, except maybe in a fractal sense. I get the nagging
feeling  the following paragraph overly complicates something simple,
but I can't think of any other way to describe your network in geometric
terms. Anybody feel free to correct or elucidate. Here goes:
You have to start one dimension lower, with a triangle. Each vertex also
has branches to 295 additional nodes, that is, is a member of 3 fully-
connected 100 node subnets, the other nodes of which are also each
vertices of  2 other triangles. There are no edge nodes as in a lattice.
The constraint is that any given node is shared by exactly three
triangles which have no other nodes in common, which seems intuitive
given that there are also no leaf (terminal) nodes. Again, I'm not not a
mathematician, so I don't know exactly what you'd call this. Geodesic,
Hettinga says, and he's right, but it's not any regular figure or solid
I know. It has tree-like properties but is obviously not a tree, since
there are links between nodes at what would be the same level.
In terms of practical considerations, network diameter is 3, and minimum
   connectivity is 8 (if you count routes with common links) at the 3 hop
level, which you'd probably want to use, with a fallback to longer
routes on retries. Unless you're trying to discourage tracing or
something.) It's a highly redundant, fault-tolerant network, and you're
also right that duplicates aren't going to be a problem. However, there
are only 297,000 links (if I'm counting right) among the 1 million
nodes, and they're probably going to get saturated real quick.

The evil triangles have been banished for now. I played with graphviz for a while last night and it's easy enough to see that this is a torus. I'm not clear if George meant a 100x100x100 or 3x100x100 lattice, but either way it's easy to see it as a wrapped cubical structure. The fact that all nodes have the same number of connections should have been my That's not to say that there isn't a way to do this with triangles, or maybe tetrahedra.  I couldn't see an easy way to do it, though. It does seem unlikely with those numbers.
Ignore the 2 other triangles stuff, I was groping at something else. In future I will try to avoid thinking out loud like that.

I meant 2,970,000 links, obviously. Not as bad as it looked. It's still subject to saturation, but it begins to look like something interesting.
