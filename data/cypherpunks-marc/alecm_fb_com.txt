@_subject: Re: [tor-talk] Facebook brute forcing hidden services 
Hi - My name=B9s Alec, I work for Facebook and am the team lead for Facebook
over Tor.
Long story short: details will come out later, but we just did the same
thing as everyone else: generated a bunch of keys with a fixed lead prefix
("facebook") and then went fishing looking for good ones.
I feel that we got tremendous lucky.
