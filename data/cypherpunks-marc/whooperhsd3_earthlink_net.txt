Have there been absolutely zero?  No.  Have there been many?  No.  Have
they been timely?  No.  As someone else pointed out, betas are for
testing.  Testing a moving target (releasing updates instead of waiting
for the next ISO) is much harder.
Unfortunately the FAQ isn't accessible right now, but it was there:
"Unsupported" means you have no service level agreement, and no one on
call to help you.  If you need these things, then yes go with RHEL-WS.
"wasting money" because there are no updates in RHN for the beta.

I think you missed the part when we asked "what updates"?
As others pointed out your RHN subscription is not tied to either that
particular machine or that particular release.  It is based entirely on
time.  If you keep your subscription paid up you could continue to use it
on every release (note I said release, not beta) that comes out.
If your main concern is not being able to use your subscription on betas
in between releases, then by all means go ahead.  If you are interested in
seeing what direction the RHLP is going, and possibly make the next
release better, then run the betas.
Why don't you just let one of your subscriptions run out and have one
machine on the release and one on the newest beta?

not meant for production systems.  Towards the end of the last beta many
people were complaining about a Sendmail bug not being fixed in the beta. Mike Harris gave his take on it here:
I would suggest not wasting an entitlement on a beta machine.  Just
because you register it doesn't mean you need to entitle it.  If you are
using the GUI, the applet will alert you to any updates that might come
