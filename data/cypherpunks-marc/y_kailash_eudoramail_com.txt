@_subject: PROPOSAL 
CONFIDENTIAL U.K. FAX NUMBER: 44-870-1309342 Dear Sir, Pardon me for starting this great proposal this way as it might surprise
you. My name is Yuvraj Kailash a native of Nepal and attorney to the late
king of Nepal who died as a result of loss in temper caused by an argument
between him and his family, as they were against him marrying his fiancie
.You were recommended by a close confidant. Who assured us of your
capability and reliability to assist us. We seek the assistance of someone
who is genuinely interested in entering into a business relationship with
long term focus, and willingness of a kind heart to help. If you are conversant with events in Nepal in May/June last year 2001,
(June 1 2001), the media was filled with reports that Crown Prince
Dipendra of Nepal had shot and killed several members of the Nepalese
Royal Family, among whom were his parents King Birenda and Queen Aiswarya,
before trying to kill himself. Prior to the late kings death (Prince Dipendra), he kept aside a secret
amount of money, for his fiancie (Miss Divyani Rana) worth over
US$30,000,000.00(Thirty million United States Dollars). This was made in
the heat of misunderstanding between him and members of his family. The
money was kept away in such a way to prevent any member of his family from
having any access or trace to the funds, which was just a part of his
wealth, this was like a gift to his fiancie and a further affirmation to
her that he was surly going to marry her, even though, his family was
against their marriage. We have kept this a secret for sometime now and
feel this is the right time to execute this transaction. The death of my late boss, left us stranded, we have therefore been
searching for a genuine and reliable person or company of trust and with
whom the Nepalese Royal Family have never had any previous, personal or
business relationship with. That person will assist in the transfer and
business re-investment of this money. We cannot do it alone due to our
present social status. We also intend to give you a reasonable share of
the funds for your assistance. These funds have been hidden away, known
only to his fiancie and myself. We would want you to safeguard this fund
from being clamped down by any body or agencies. As soon as we receive your letter of acceptance/acknowledgement, I shall
give you more highlights on this transaction. THIS IS A RISK FREE TRANSACTION AND MUST NOT BE REVILED TO ANYONE NOT EVEN
YOUR LAWYER, ATTORNEY, FAMILY, FRIENDS ETC. If you are capable and trust
worthy and can keep to our instructions to make the above Proposal a
reality. Then CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY ONLY THROUGH OUR CONFIDENTIAL U.K FAX NUMBER:
44-870-1309342 AS INDICATED ABOVE DO NOT REPLY US BY EMAIL. Please
indicate in your reply your PERSONAL/CONFIDENTIAL TELEPHONE NUMBERS,
CELLULAR OR MOBILE NUMBER, CONFIDENTIAL FAX NUMBER AND YOUR CONFIDENTIAL
EMAIL ADDRESS when replying. GOD BLESS YOU. Yuvraj Kailash
