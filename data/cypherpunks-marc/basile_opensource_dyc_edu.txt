Very disturbing.   I wonder if its possible to hide encrypted traffic as
seemingly unencrypted http traffic in much the same way as a gpg key is
rendered as ascii armored, or stenographically inside images.  Although
such methods may be inefficient, they may be good enough for some purposes.
It would be good to know what technologies these ISPs will implement to
do the packet inspection for encrypted tunnels.  Half the problem is you
don't really know what they'll be looking for and so you don't know how
to circumvent.
