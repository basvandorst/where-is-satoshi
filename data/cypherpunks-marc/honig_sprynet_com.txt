In fact, Anthrax spores are much more useful than say smallpox militarily,
because Anthrax doesn't spread to your homeland.  That's the whole
point.  You have to use spores to infect, but infected people don't
make spores.  Also, once infected, you're toast quickly despite treatment.
But other background info backs this up:
* You have to know what you're doing to force the bacilli
to make spores, eg industrially.  The bacteria will do it on its
own under certain conditions, ie, its environment is getting harsh.
True for lots of bugs.
That's the knowledge that the germwar people know takes finesse,
making spores and then making a decent inhalable aerosol of the thing.  * There *are* nasties that live in the soil and make spores.  An
archeologist told me of a debilitating lung fungus you get if you dig in the
ground a lot.  A cell biologist told of someone getting a weird
disease because they had fed human hair
to their garden bacteria (to deter animals I think).
* Similar (in a real bio sense) animals will often share
diseases -HIV in primates, anthrax in sheep and the like, etc.
Flu jumps between birds, pigs, and men.  The cowpox/smallpox
interaction has been noted here.  Rabies gets anything warmblooded I think.  Quite a lot of variation in species specificity, and a resivoir in "wild and domestic lower
vertebrates" (like hanta in mice, lyme in deer) is common.
Bacteria chose to make spores when the puddle is drying up.
Given current events, skepticism is even wiser than usual.  But
I wouldn't doubt the existing medical or bio info.
The "extra-vigilance --> extra detection" explanation is of course possible.
Still, *fantastic* timing, as has been pointed out.

In a thread "Re: When the FBI Guys Come Knocking..." I claimed
(from memory) that cats can decrease allergies.  I was unable
to find the _Science_ ref but I
found a few refs to the original research reported in The Lancet 357:752-56 (2001).   Reproduced below.  I don't
make this stuff up.
Contrary to popular belief, high levels of cat allergen in the home can sometimes decrease the risk of a child developing
asthma, says grantee Thomas A. Platts-Mills, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of
Virginia. Apparently, the presence of a cat can alter the immune system in a manner similar to
allergy shots, he reports.
For other allergens that trigger asthma, such as the
dust mite and cockroach, the higher the exposure level, the more likely it is that a child
will produce "allergic" antibodies, called immunoglobulin-E or Ig-E antibodies, against them.
This high exposure increases the child's risk of becoming allergic and developing asthma.
But with cats, high exposure actually can confer
protection -- at least in some children, Dr. Platts-Mills says. He and colleagues measured the
levels of allergic antibodies to cat allergen in 226 children, aged 12 to 14 years, and tested the
children for asthma. They also measured the amount of cat allergen in the children's homes and
discovered that low-to-moderate amounts of cat allergen seemed to trigger allergy, but high
amounts -- greater than 20 micrograms per gram of house dust -- reduced both IgE antibodies and the
likelihood of asthma.
                      "This result alters the advice we give patients,"
says Dr. Platts-Mills. "I would not recommend                       that all parents get rid of their cat because they
are concerned their child might develop asthma.                       High exposure to cat allergen appears to be
protective for some children and a risk factor for                       others. If the child is wheezing and has a positive
skin test to cat allergen, then you should get rid                       of your cat."
                      The high levels of cat allergen prompted the
children's immune systems to make mostly a                       particular subtype of immunoglobulin G (IgG), called
IgG4 antibody, rather than IgE, Dr.                       Platts-Mills explains. Allergy shots are believed to
produce a similar effect. "This research sheds                       more light on the relationship between allergen
exposure and asthma," he says. "When we                       further understand this process, it might lead to new
treatments for asthma."                       Reference: T Platts-Mills et al. Sensitisation,

                       BACKGROUND: Although asthma is strongly associated
with immediate hypersensitivity to
                       indoor allergens, several studies have suggested
that a cat in the house can decrease the risk of
                       asthma. We investigated the immune response to cat
and mite allergens, and asthma among
                       children with a wide range of allergen exposure.
METHODS: We did a population-based
                       cross-sectional study of children (aged 12-14
years), some of whom had symptoms of asthma
                       and bronchial hyper-reactivity. Antibodies to mite
(Der f 1) and cat (Fel d 1) allergens
                       measured by isotype (IgG and IgG4) specific
radioimmunoprecipitation assays were compared
                       with sensitisation and allergen concentrations in
house dust. FINDINGS: 226 children were
                       recruited, 47 of whom had symptoms of asthma and
bronchial hyper-reactivity. Increasing
                       exposure to mite was associated with increased
prevalence of sensitisation and IgG antibody to
                       Der f 1. By contrast, the highest exposure to cat
was associated with decreased sensitisation,
                       but a higher prevalence of IgG antibody to Fel d 1.
Thus, among children with high exposure,
                       the odds of sensitisation to mite rather than cat
was 4.0 (99% CI 1.49-10.00). Furthermore, 31
                       of 76 children with 23 microg Fel d 1 at home, who
were not sensitised to cat allergen had
                       >125 units of IgG antibody to Fel d 1. Antibodies to
Fel d 1 of the IgG4 isotype were strongly
                       correlated with IgG antibody in both allergic and
non-allergic children (r=0.84 and r=0.66,
                       respectively). Sensitisation to mite or cat
allergens was the strongest independent risk factor for
                       asthma (p<0.001). INTERPRETATION: Exposure to cat
allergen can produce an IgG and
                       IgG4 antibody response without sensitisation or risk
of asthma. This modified T-helper-2 cell
                       response should be regarded as a form of tolerance
and may be the correct objective of
                       immunotherapy. The results may also explain the
observation that animals in the house can
                       decrease the risk of asthma.

FTC shutters thousands of Web sites      By Reuters      October 1, 2001, 11:40 a.m. PT      WASHINGTON--A U.S. court shut down thousands of Web sites after it
     determined that they diverted Web surfers and held them captive while
     bombarding them with ads for pornography and gambling, the U.S.
     said on Monday.      According to the Federal Trade Commission, John Zuccarini, of
Andalusia, Pa., outside
     Philadelphia, operated more than 5,500 Web sites that diverted Web
surfers from their
     intended destinations and exposed them to pop-up ads.      Zuccarini did not immediately respond to calls for comment.      Zuccarini registered many
     misspellings of popular sites, such
     as Cartoonnetwork.com, the
     FTC said, in a bid to draw traffic
     from sloppy typists. Visitors to
     his sites often could not leave, as
     the "back" button on their Web
     browsers would be rigged to
     trigger more pop-up ads.      "After one FTC staff member
     closed out of 32 separate
     windows, leaving just two
     windows on the task bar, he
     selected the 'back' button, only to
     watch as the same seven windows that initiated the blitz erupted on
his screen, and the
     cybertrap began anew," the FTC said in its complaint, filed in the
U.S. District Court for
     the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia.      The scheme is especially harmful to children or employees who may put
their jobs at risk
     when they inadvertently call up pornographic or gambling-related
material, the FTC said.      The district court has ordered Zuccarini to take his sites offline,
the FTC said, while the
     case continues. But as of early Monday afternoon, at least one site
registered to Zuccarini,
     Annakurnikova.com, was still functional.      Zuccarini had registered 41 variations on the name of pop star Britney
Spears, the FTC
     said.      In its court action, the FTC is seeking to get Zuccarini to return the
estimated $800,000 to
     $1 million he earns in advertising revenues.      According to the FTC, Zuccarini has been sued at least 63 times in the
last two years by
     trademark owners, celebrities or others seeking to recover variants of
their Internet domain
     names. He has lost 53 of those suits and been forced to return nearly
200 domain names,
     the FTC said.

tell what makes each individual happy, this is again optimal.
In a centrally-ruled (statist) society some elites decide what *should* make *others* happy.  And forces everyone to pay for it.
Not only doomed in reality, but immoral.

is not much time to break a person, and cruder torture methods are fatal.
2. Cyanide pills were standard issue for folks dropped behind enemy

The following analysis is the product of DSSis strategic analysis team
using scenario planning to make sense of the current
situation and the war on terrorism. During the course of exploring future
scenarios, past events acquired meaning, and the
direction of the conflict as desired by Al-Qaida began to make sense.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY DSSis strategic scenario analysis regarding Al-Qaidas endgame leads to
the following conclusions about the real current
events:      The network of networks known as Al-Qaida has successfully laid a
trap for the United States. Al-Qaida retains the
     initiative and the U.S. is operating inside the intentions and plans
of Al-Qaida      Al-Qaida cannot destroy the U.S. forces inside the U.S., nor can it
convince the U.S. to leave the Middle East using
     terror attacks. The intention of the terror attacks is a provocation
to force the U.S. to engage and deploy forces to the
     Middle East, where such forces could be destroyed      The intention and purpose of Al-Qaidas plans are either to make the
Middle East ungovernable, or to gain control of
     the petroleum production system in the region. Application of the oil
weapon could be used to attempt to force
     withdrawal of U.S. presence in the region; outright destruction of the
petroleum production system would leave the U.S.
     with no or greatly reduced real interests in the region      Control or destruction of the petroleum production system in the
Middle East, and the potential for attacks on global
     petroleum production, would transform the political situation in the
region, initiate a global depression by degrading or
     destroying critical industries of developing and advanced

Hardly dogma; look at history.  Unhindered by social engineers/violence monopolists, people used
tools (capital) to increase productivity.  This had much more

agricultural one, though nowadays agri shows high productivity
thanks to some sophisticated tools, too.
Unhindered, people use their forebrains and invest in the future.  The
investment might be themselves acquiring a skill, a tool,
or investing in others' activities.  The payoff structure
of the universe encourages this.
If you encourage others to get educated, you are a capitalist.
If you discourage others from investing in themselves or others,
don't try to acquire the right skill or tool to meet your goals, I'd say you weren't a capitalist.  You'll have a hard time doing

Aha.  I have learned something then; I didn't realize that reps

degrees of freedom.  Though it must be obvious to new squirrels
(eg by observing other more seasoned squirrels lack of reaction) that no
one takes Spoofie Squirrel seriously.  In any case, each squirrel certainly
believes their own set of experiences (and reputations inferred therefrom)
and so would advocate the adoption of its experience, if sufficiently verbal to do so.  Much like primates.
In any case, "Spoofie is unreliable about badgers" seems to me to be
a reputation.
At one extreme of opinion, reps are personal; at the other they are objective
and are therefore worth transferring amongst members of so-equipt
Nature *does* have joints at which it can be carved; high-rep people
will tend to recommend other high-rep people and the UFO types will
cross reference the Bigfoot folks.  Such is the nature of peer

Indeed, even when there are objective measures, all parties
may not agree because they may not agree on those measures.
If Alice Squirrel makes an alarm call and Bob Squirrel sees
a threat, but Charlie Squirrel doesn't see it, Bob and Charlie
will have different stats for Alice's alarm-call reputation.
But rep cap as an idea is surely *stronger* when you keep separate
numbers for different qualities -reliable vs. interesting posts,
for instance.  This is *necessary* since individuals vary greatly
within themselves.  Politicians with excellent reps on issue A
and mediocre reps on issue B, for instance.
Perhaps though authors should mention the *attribute* whose
reputation is estimated when its not obvious.  Similarly authors
should state *who* is doing the estimating when its not clear
its the author.

God DAMN but you are obtuse.  First people swapped chickens for goats.
Then they used more portable forms of exact trade, where
the portable forms were still of equal value, but easier to pocket.
Eventually this got (partially) symbolic, but was private.
With reps and all that.
Then the govt discovered they could fund wars (etc) by asserting
their paper was good ---after all, they could confiscate by
force whatever actual value they needed to back it up.
If you don't see the implications for future history, you may find many threads here confusing.

And the escrow services can do so anonymously (without lifting the

all escrow agencies *are*, and they exist, even with quill pens

George, Petro is *way* off here.  A PR firm/psyop division can only try to promote an opinion.  They cannot control others' estimations of their clients' reputations.  Consider a PR firm that fucks up.
A pile of little baby arms, to excerpt Coppola.
Yes, a good psyop operation can deny negative information,
promote the positive, and thereby influence the population.  That is a matter of information flow & control; the reps (which are distributed
in the minds of subscribers) are not directly controlled.
I suggest recognizing the distinction between controlling
info and slant (psyops and Dan Rather and Turner and Murdoch, I don't actually follow that stuff) and controlling
reps which can't be done directly (but which can be measured).  The fact that info & slant *can* influence distributed reps is why psyops
folks have jobs.
Finally the reps which can (or can't) be bought and sold (the
subject of an amazingly advanced thread, presently) is distinct from control of info and reps thereof.
Petro is unfortunately mixing 'selling-of-nym-reps' with 'PR's effect
of reps in a given population'.  With all due respect.

and there is no cooperation required --just a one-way broadcast.
