Teen Anarchist Back Online Despite FBI & Big ISPs
SHERMAN OAKS, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A.,
07 Mar 2002, 10:55 PM CST
Sherman Austin has not been charged with breaking any laws, but that hasn't stopped two of the biggest Internet service providers (ISPs) from running the California teenager off their property for his anarchist views.
Last month, after incarcerating Austin, 18, for more than a week, federal prosecutors decided not to file charges against Austin for publishing bomb-making information at his site Raisethefist.com and hacking into several sites to post revolutionary calls to arms.
In recent days, however, Austin's anti-government message apparently set off content radars at Yahoo's Groups service.
A Yahoo representative would not comment on why Raisethefist, an online message board that had 58 members, disappeared from the service without notice last week.
Yahoo "honors the spirit of the First Amendment and free speech," according to spokeswoman Mary Osako, but she noted that Yahoo's terms of service prohibit posting "content that incites violence."
