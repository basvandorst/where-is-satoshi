ves, to make decisions like "what sort of communication network would be si=
mple and useful between small communities", and "where would we like to tra=
vel, or need to travel, and how would we like to do that".
My analysis is that there are 2 'Covid' viruses:
1) a 'strong' flu - a biological virus - which results from a combination o=
f factors, I think mainly pollution.
2) a massive hysteria, collective paranoia and coordinated fear which is by=
 far much more dangerous than the 'biological' virus. If our human society =
would be a network of machines, then that 'second Covid virus' would be a c=
omputer virus.
In 2) what is striking is the leading role of 'the police' and other simila=
r fascist and coercive powers. People are getting beaten, fined, arrested .=
.. or even killed because they dare to go in the street or refuse to wear a=
 mask. Which mask is probably generally useless by the way ...  note the ro=
le of the media in the amplification of that fear: "That man went to a part=

m god, at least from the god of Covid-19, like if Covid-9 was the punishmen=
t for our crimes and the mask the redemption, the police being the minister=
s of the 'cult'...
So what is hidden behind this madness? Nothing good? A collective madness..=
. something sinister which is just starting.
Today we must get a mask to get food, tomorrow we will have to show our anu=
s to get the same. This will never end.
It is a great crime than to refuse to sell food or healthcare to someone be=
cause that person 'does not wear a mask'.
Can we organize ourselves against that ? Creating groups? Again preppers ar=

Many things were wrong with Mr Assange, If you intend to be a spy, then you=

If you intend to be a 'journalist' (and nothing really positive can be link=

Finally, if you intend to create an 'open society' which is 'clean' and tra=

If you mess with the US military secrets, expect reactions. In Russia, Assa=

 to the 'Collateral Murders' which has produced by WikiLeaks... featuring h=
orrible crimes , some fakes, some reals.
(and good luck to know which one are real and which one are fake)
So what do we learn from Wikileaks, that the USA are no better than the oth=

There is just a conclusion... whatever one may think of Assange, he certain=

 didn't steal anyone and didn't intend to cause harm to anyone - even not t=

What happens to Assange will happen to many others. Once you're in their su=

Again, all this is a question of action... legal team is bullshit. Totally =

What we see is the manifestation of a hidden (and hideous) power inside the=
