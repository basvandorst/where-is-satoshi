PRIZE AMOUNT:$1,OOO,OOO.OO
RESPOND BY DEADLINE
I urge you to respond to this Notice immediately. Why?
As the PHASE CHART at right demonstrates, the majority of all Prize Numbers offered for this Giveaway are projected to be ineligible to win because of failure to respond on time. In fact, as many as 60% of these numbers are likely to be disqualified. This is advantageous to you because ...
Your PHASE CHART shows you are still very much in the game. You can still guarantee that your entry will make it in to PHASE 3 WINNER SELECTION PROCESSING if you submit an entry now. Remember, the majority of Prize Numbers are expected to be ineligible -- but not the one you'll receive if you respond by the deadline
Just think about the thrill. If you are selected the winner, Publishers Clearing House will make sure the "Big Check" for $1,OOO,OOO is made out in your name and delivered directly to to your address.
But first things first. We must receive the $1,000,000.00 Official Entry Affidavit by the deadine. If we don't hear from you by this date, you will forfeit any prize associated with the prize number you would have received by entering through this Bulletin, even if it is identified as the winner. Please don't disregard this email -- you may forget to respond on time. I urge you to take the few minutes it takes to complete your Official Entry Form.
The process we will use to select the winner will begin before you know it, so I must emphasize the importance of entering now. There's no thrill like winning -- so please respond at once.
Wishing you all the best,
Todd Sloane  Senior Vice President
