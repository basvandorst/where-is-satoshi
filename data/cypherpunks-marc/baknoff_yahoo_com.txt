Actually, this isn't a violation.  Under Federal law for years now, if you enter or leave the country and security pulls your system for inspection, you HAVE to provide the key.  If you're hiding partitions and fail to notify the investigators of same, you are in violation of the law.
Any lawsuit will go nowhere.
