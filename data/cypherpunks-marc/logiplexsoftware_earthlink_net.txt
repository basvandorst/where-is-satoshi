I'd recommend comp.lang.lisp.  The people there are very friendly and
more than happy to help you test your newsreader.  Eric Naggum in
particular will probably send you a rather large post to verify that
your newsreader can handle long expositions and embedded epithets.   He
has on occasion even offered to fly across the globe to help others
understand.  All around terrific people there whose day-to-day
interactions with others have helped make Lisp the success it is today.
