I agree that their is a real possibility that a said user may forget  the password owing to numerous reasons,
But I am not aware of any technique that can prove beyond a reasonable  doubt that the user has really forgotten his password or is pretending  it to avoid a sentence.
Seems like the case is bound to set a precedent in the interpretation  of this law. Any which ways it would be worthwhile to observe whether  the US courts follow a similar course of action as their UK  It is also kind of interesting that the UK courts follow a course of  action which almost deters users from using encryption for the fear of  forgetting keys that may lead to a sentence.
That leaves people in UK the option of using Key Escrow Encryption  scheme only.

Its strange that the act of revealing the password has essentially  been termed underprivileged by the courts in the mentioned case.
The Supreme Court on earlier occasions has termed acts of providing  fingerprints, blood sample etc. underprivileged because in principle  they do not reveal a persons thoughts or knowledge of a particular  fact and also because possession of ones own fingerprint is an  undeniable fact.
In case the Supreme Court concurs with the decision of the District  Court the options Mr. Boucher would have are interesting -
1) Self Incriminate - by providing the password that is known to Mr.  Boucher which in turn would turn testimonial of his knowledge and  control over the said laptop and its contents
2) Perjury - by lying on oath that he does not knows the password that  can be proved otherwise by the ICE Agent for he found the laptop sans  the encryption
3) Contempt of Court - by rejecting both the options mentioned above
