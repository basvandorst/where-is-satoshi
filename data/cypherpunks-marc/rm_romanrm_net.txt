Please stop trying to make people build buttcoin wallets into everything. Not
everyone may be a fan of your "satoshi"-shitoshi pyramid scheme, shocked eh?
If supporting Tor will automatically mean pushing the Bitcoin scam onto people,
e.g. personally I will have to reconsider whether or not I want to continue my
participation as a relay operator.

What would be the point of this, why not just a text chat?
Both voice recognition and automated translation are nowhere near good enough
to be used in this context. Add to that a 1-2 second delay of audio that you
get over Tor, and all you will get is just a complete hilarious mess, not any
kind of useful "conversation".
