Thank you for contacting my office.  If you are a constituent of the First
Congressional District of New Jersey, and would like a response, please
provide my office with your mailing address.  If you have already done so,
please know that you will receive a response in the mail.  I respond to all
constituent inquiries.  Unfortunately, due to the high volume of e-mails my
office receives daily, e-mails from outside my district will not receive a
response.  I encourage you to please contact your local representative.  You
can find that person's name by going to  the website of the
House of Representatives.  I thank you again for contacting me.
Congressman Robert E. Andrews
