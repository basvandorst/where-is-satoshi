Dear Sir,
My name is Mohammed Abacha, son to the former late President in Nigeria (Gen. Sanni Abacha)
While my father was in power; i moved funds for him to different banks and finance outfits both here in Nigeria and abroad and to whom i was also the next of kin.
When my father died in 1998 and the Democratic government that came into power traced many of these funds and were repatriated back to the Nigeria government's account and Which as a result i was also held in detention for almost two years because of their belief that i know so much about these transactions.
Please i will need the following from you:
1.Your assistance to move the rest of these funds to your safe account for business and the up-keep of our family.
2. Total confidentiality of the transaction as not to lose the rest of the funds to the government.
3.Your private phone, fax and email address.
In addition, the family will be willing to offer you any reasonable percentage requested by you to take care of all sorts of inconviniences the project might cause you and also to serve as compensation.
Thanking you so much for your anticipated cooperation while I await your earliest response through my email:moh_aba
Mohammed Abacha.
