I,am all right Jack
First donated archives space is used for personal use.
Second any new person coming on to the list thinks it a ship of Yes Hettinga we know how to kill file,you have been in many.
Instead of the kill file forward the post back to them,they will then put you in their kill file,the end result they would be Think outside of the box.
Look, boys and girls, he said malappropriately, we're all adults here. We know both where the 'd' key is, *and* oddly enough, we can even filter stuff too. If not, get a *real* mail reader, as this is a *real* mail list. I like Eudora. Your mileage may vary. The little bits of 1/2K dreck that His Choateness, and The MattDimwit put here kinda disappear *completely* with decent filtering. If you use lne.com for your node, which seems to kill spam quite nicely, and you're properly bozo-
filtered, you don't, as they say in linguistically-challenged neighborhoods, see shit. It's cool. Even when Choate changes his virus coat like he did this afternoon, a few seconds with Eudora's make-filter command, and poof, he's lost to the breeze like so much dandruff. What fucks things up, of course, is meta-choatage, most of which I can deal with, because it usually comes from sane people who, again malappropriately haven't come to their senses yet and killfiled a bozo or two, and being sane and usually smart people, they have sane and smart things to say. But, frankly, hortatorations to the Choatster himself, about his behavior, on the public list channel, is frankly, a complete waste of bandage. In a word, go find a room, and do your sado-masochism offline, where the rest of us don't have to watch it, please. Yes, I know, meta-
meta-choatage is just as bad. I don't care. You know where the delete key, and your filter file is. If you don't, well, you deserve what you read. :-). Cheers, RAH -- ----------------- R. A. Hettinga
