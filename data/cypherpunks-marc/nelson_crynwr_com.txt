to which I would add:
3. Cryptography, and therefore PKI, is meaningless unless you first
define a threat model.  In all the messages with this Subject, I've
only see one person even mention "threat model".  Think about the
varying threat models, and the type of cryptography one would propose
to address them.  Even the most common instance of encryption,
encrypted web forms for hiding credit card numbers, suffers from
addressing a limited threat model.  There's a hell of a lot of known
plaintext there.

I agree that it's irrelevant.  So why is he trying to argue from
authority (always a fallacy anyway) without *even* having any way to
prove that he is that authority?  Fine, let him desire plausible
deniability.  I plausibly deny his appeal to (self-)authority as being
completely without merit.

We have, of course, no way to verify this fact, since your messages
are not cryptographically signed.  For someone who claims to be
knowledgable about cryptography, this seems like a suspicious omission.

Can't be done.  I don't have time to go into ALL the reasons.
Fortunately for me, any one reason is sufficient.   it's all about
the economics.  You have failed to specify that the cost of breaking
into the data has to exceed the value of the data.  But even if you
did that, you'd have to assume that the data was never worth more than
that to *anyone*.  As soon as it was worth that, they could break into
the data, and data is, after all, just data.
Ignore economics at your peril.

You're wearing your programmer's hat when you say that.  But the
problem isn't programming, but is instead economic.  Switch hats.  The
changes that you list above may or may not offer some security
advantages.  Who cares?  What really matters is whether they increase
the cost of copying.  I say that the answer is no, for a very simple
reason: breaking into your own computer is a "victimless" crime.
In a crime there are at least two parties: the victim and the
perpetrator.  What makes the so-called victimless crime unique is that
the victim is not present for the perpetration of the crime.  In such
a crime, all of the perpetrators have reason to keep silent about the
comission of the crime.  So it will be with people breaking into their
own TCPA-protected computer and application.  Nobody with evidence of
the crime is interested in reporting the crime, nor in stopping
further crimes.
Yes, the TCPA hardware introduces difficulties.  If there is way
around them in software, then someone need only write it once.  The
whole TCPA house of cards relies on no card ever falling down.  Once
it falls down, people have unrestricted access to content.  And that
means that we go back to today's game, where the contents of CDs are
open and available for modification.  Someone could distribute a pile
of "random" bits, which, when xored with the encrypted copy, becomes
an unencrypted copy.

Anybody can pay to send email right now.  You just go to paypal, type
in the person's email, enter the amount of money you think is
necessary to persuade them to read the email, and put the text of your
message in the comment box.  My email is paypal.com
feel free to send me as much email as you want, ca-ching!
But anyway, that's not what I propose.  I suggest that email from
strangers needs to come with an introducer of some sort to convince
you to read it.  There's a dozen different kind of introducers which
could be used, some of them using cryptography, only one or two of
which involve payment.  The days when all email was treated equally by
an email client are long past, or at least, should be if you're
running a decent email client.  Maybe the level of spam complaints is
caused by the low quality of email clients?

Huh?  Somebody is confused here.  DomainKeys is 1) an e-mail
authentication system, and 2) it doesn't check IP addresses.  Instead,
it uses cryptographic signing using public/private keys which have the
potential of being assigned down to the individual level.

Yes, this is true.  John Gilmore is a pain in the ass for standing on
his rights (some government types might say *fucking* pain in the
ass), but he is correct.  ALL of the effort spent to secure open
relays was basically wasted effort, because spammers just moved on to
insecure client machines.  The proper route to control spam is to
involve users in prioritizing their email, so that their friend's
email comes first, followed by anybody they've sent mail to, followed
by people they've gotten email from before, followed by mailing list
mail, followed by email from strangers (which is where all the spam
is).  All of that relies on email authentication to work.
Why the heck can't we just shortcut all this pain, and just listen to
John in the first place?  I vote to elect John to the post of
Benevolent Dictator For Life.

This is why we need a national identification card.
It's also why we don't need a national identification card.
The same evidence leads to two different conclusions depending on what
you had already concluded was true.  Reminds me of listening to Alan
Greenspan.  :-)

Indeed. By the time you set up a powerline interface, you may as well
just reverse-bias a diode, compare it to a low-pass-filtered version
of itself, and capture that noise.
You could do it with a DigiSpark, and get a USB bytestream. 100% open

I was trying to be funny, to dampen the pain of having your mistake
called out. That didn't work; my apologies. And you *were* wrong,
because you mentioned crypto without mentioning the threat
model. SERIOUSLY. "Crypto" is one hand clapping without a threat model
to clap against.
We *all* know that all cryptography can be cracked; it's just a matter
of resources and time. Therefore, complaining about weak cryptography
is meaningless unless you say what you're defending against, because
ultimately, ALL crypto is weak. It's only in the context of a threat
model that we can evaluate the security of cryptograhy. Pig latin is
effective against a two-year-old. Norwegian is effective against an
English speaker (as my parents well understood). ROT-26 is effective
against people who don't know how to read.
You know this. You just forgot. I was just reminding you.

Sorry, but you have to do it every time. Every one has its zero; every
electron has its hole.
Cryptography without a threat model is like cookies without milk. Keep
saying it until you have it memorized.

You're making a claim about the security of a cryptographic algorithm
without specifying the threat model. You are, technically, in a state
of sin. I forgive you my son. Your penance is to memorize another 30

Without being on the network? Zero. That doesn't mean that all 48 bits
contribute to entropy, but neither does it mean that zero bits
contribute to the entropy pool.

Let's say that they can. That means that the contribution to the

Let's say that they can. That means that the contribution to the

Can you see where this is going? There is an growing amount of
entropy in the world. Why are you worried about running out of it, or
finding it unavailable except over a very short time window?
