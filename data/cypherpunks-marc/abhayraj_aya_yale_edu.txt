thanks, point well taken. when the list is/was good, I do/did enjoy
participating by actively tracking and learning from several awesome
conversations and subsequent action. since my silence on the list has been
now interrupted by this peculiar scenario of non-anonymity that I'm
entangled in, who knows, we might indeed see some thoughts articulated on
subjects such as those mentioned by you.
in good faith,

Z speaks so much bullshit it is amazing no one has cut his vocal cords off
yet, he is probably the single biggest piss-off on this piss-off list.
