@_subject: Re: pgp "global directory" bugged instructions 
Thanks for the bug report. We appreciate your help in fine-tuning the language in the verification emails of the beta test of the PGP Global Directory. We noticed this one, ourselves, and put out an improvement to it on Tuesday. Please check it over and see what you think of the improved version.
If you would like to send bug reports to us directly, please feel free to send them to beta Cypherpunks and Cryptography are both inefficient ways to get them to us, as Cryptography waits for Perry to approve the post, and Cypherpunks waits for Bob Hettinga to forward it.
However, the Global Directory does not consolidate information from any other keyservers. It is a replacement for the old keyserver, keyserver.pgp.com, and will take over that venerable old server's job once beta test is concluded. We are, however, migrating a number of keys from the old keyserver to that one.
Think of the new keyserver as a mix between traditional keyservers, mailing list servers like mailman, and a robot CA. Its intent is to improve upon the older keyservers by giving some modicum of assurance that keys in it belong to someone, as well as allowing someones to recover from forgetting their passphrase.
