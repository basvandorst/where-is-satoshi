@_subject: Be interviewed on AM/FM radio in the city of your choice guaranteed OR YOUR MONEY BACK! 
From past experience we know radio works. To maximize the impact we needed options.  We needed the ability to select the right show in the right market for the right author.  Now we can.
Beginning in January 2005, Bookman Publishing can offer its authors guaranteed radio exposure on the AM/FM radio shows of their choice.  The program we have put together allows us to work closely with individual authors and schedule the shows that will maximize exposure and create the most interest among listeners.  We will schedule shows in the market of your choice.  For example, we will set up interviews in areas where you have events such as book signings or conferences. We can also schedule interviews on the shows that best fit the topic of your book.  For just $399, we guarantee to book you at least one interview (the first show might lead to more interviews at no charge). Choose your market and even the show subject.  Or choose a syndicated show that will air on between 10 to 50 participating AM/FM stations. If we are not able to book the interview in the market you want, we will refund your $399.  (Once the interview is booked, we cannot refund the Top Markets Available For Interviews
