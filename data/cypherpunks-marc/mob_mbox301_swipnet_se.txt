I doubt that the story is true. Belgium couldn't be that different
from Sweden. Since SMS-ing is cheap it's a major method of
communicating especially for younger (poorer) persons but
increasingly also for the middle aged. The "Hi, I feel lonely,
everybody seems out to get me, can I stay at your place for a while,
Grettings, Osama"-SMS joke chain letter - with several variants -
have been around here for several weeks and in a very large scale.
I've recieved several and everyone I've asked has got at least one,
usually from a close friend.
The joking community is unintentionally flooding Echelon.
