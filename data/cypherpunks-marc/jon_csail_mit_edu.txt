:No, it was a rookie fuck-up that enabled old-fashioned detective work. if
:it wasn't a fookie fuck-up, then none of this would have happened.
It was human error, which is what traditional police work relies on all
the time.
I chuckled a bit too at the obvious blunders in the report, but when
you get down to it maintaining sufficient operational security for a
long term pseudonymous identity especially involved in real world
physical transactions is virtually impossible.
Short term disposible identies are perhaps more workable but those are
less useful for commerce or any other transaction that requires
reputation building.
