... used in court:
I think you're not getting the trick here: with truecrypt's plausible deniability hack you *CAN* give them the password and they *CAN* decrypt the file [or filesystem].  BUT: it is a double encryption setup.  If you use one password only some of it gets decrypted, if you use the other password all of it is decrypted.  There's no way to tell if you used the first password that you didn't decrypt everything.  So in theory you could hide the nasty stuff behind the second passsword, a ton of innocent stuff behind the first password and just give them the first password when asked.  In practice, I dunno if it really works or will really let you slide by.
