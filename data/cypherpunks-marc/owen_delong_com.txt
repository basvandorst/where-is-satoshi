I don't find the claim all that extraordinary. I think it was only a

as a perfect way to distribute anonymously.
Sure, but law enforcement isn't exactly renowned for doing the smart
things in such situations. Especially during their rather extensive
learning curve.
None whatsoever. It's an entirely plausible alternate explanation.
At this point, we can't rule either of them out. However, the basic

What if it's a free open wireless ISP where all you have to do is click
an assent to a basic TOS agreement?
What if it's a free open wireless ISP (such as any Apple store) where
all you have to do is get within range and connect? No contract or
click-thru at all?
In many cases, but not all. However I do have to wonder what makes you
think a civil contract would be a deterrent to someone willing to
commit a criminal act?
But such restrictions are not all that common and aren't particularly
relevant to this discussion.
I find it amusing that you feel the need to continuously repeat "an
end user operating a TOR exit node." Is there some reason that it makes
a difference whether the entity operating the TOR exit node or open
Wireless AP is an end user or an ISP? Of course, I would argue that
operating an open Wireless AP or a TOR node makes you a form of ISP
whether you recognize the fact or not.
So is the operator of a TOR node. The primary difference being that
TOR is specifically engineered to make such an intercept virtually
useless. So it seems your real criticism here is simply that TOR
is a more effective anonymizer.
This assumes a whole lot of facts not in evidence. If I were to put
up a TOR exit node, I would assume that the most likely intent would
be free speech which is not illegal in my jurisdiction. I don't
consider that I am responsible for the myriad jurisdictions that
may exist at the entry and/or transit points prior to reaching
said exit node.
Do you have any data to support your conclusion that criminal intent is
the most likely use of TOR exit nodes?
Very hard to prove that intent beyond a reasonable doubt in my opinion.
or not.
You have yet to show one yet. You've shown how they're different from =
ISPs, but there are many ISPs operating today which don't fit your model
of what constitutes an ISP, so I remain unconvinced.
I'm further unconvinced that your proposed distinctions are actually
meaningful from a legal perspective. Perhaps the lawyer that chimed
in earlier will come back and address this question.
I guess this depends almost entirely on what properties it is that
you believe define an ISP.
Given the number of ISPs that don't have customers, don't collect
data on their customers, and operate free open public access networks,
I don't think that the properties you suggest above can be used in
said definition.
As I said, given that Apple Computer operates such networks quite
intentionally in all of their stores as well as within range of the
Apple campus in Cupertino, I think you'd be hard pressed to claim
that these are strictly some small fringe exceptions.
To me, an ISP is defined by the fact that they provide packet forwarding
service(s) to some group of external parties.
By that definition, I cannot make any legitimate claim that any of
the following are not ISPs:
