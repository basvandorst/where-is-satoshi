prompted blurt punishing references plurals
Mr. Charles Hendrickson, Macrovision Reseach Group, CEO:
"...I'm sure that software prices stopped falling.
Within just two weeks all world software producing brands
will raise them...
..I think that two weeks are the last chance to get Microsoft,
Adobe, Symantec top products for summer prices...
..yes, I think that Windows XP Service Pack 2 will
cost $180 again, not $80 as now..."
Macrovision Reseach report:
Prices of future of software market revolution?
range Amadeus typist innings Candide
bugled pourers statutory overstated ammoniac
aloha biceps keeled Florentine Dougherty
degraded rebooting reordered priced carnivals
