Sorry, I didn't realize there was a difference. Basically my point is that
if I restrict what you say, its not a violation of Freedom of Speech, only
if the Government restricts speech.
Btw, I would only try to restrict speech if it was directed towards me and
not welcome.

Common misconception that Freedom of Speech has anything to do
with you or me and what we tell each other. Actually Freedom of Speech
means freedom from governement censorship, and has nothing do with with
U.S. Citizen to Citizen communications.
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
