 FORMER CHIEF SECURITY ADVISER TO THE LATE HEAD OF
STATE OF NIGERIA, GEN.SANI ABACHA WHO DIED IN 1998 AS
 A RESULT OF HEART FAILURE. SINCE THE DEATH OF GEN.
 ABACHA,AND THE SUBSEQUENT DISSOLUTION OF HIS
 GOVERNMENT,THE NEW GOVERNMENT OF GEN. OLUSEGUN
 OBASANJO HAS TURNED AGAINST MY FATHER AND MY FAMILY.
   AT FIRST,WE THOUGHT IT WAS A NORMAL INTERROGATIONAS
 MY FATHER SHOULD KNOW ABOUT SOME CONFIDENTIALDEALINGS
 OF HIS BOSS. LATE GEN.ABACHA OR HARASSMENT FROM
 ENEMIES HE MADE WHILE IN GOVT. AS THE CHIEF SECURITY
 OFFICER,BUT WE WERE PROVED WRONG. MY FATHER IS NOW IN
 DETENTION IN A PRISON IN NIGERIA PENDING THE
 DETAMINATION OF HIS CASE WHICH IS IN COURT AT THE
 MOMENT.ALL MY FATHER'S ACCOUNTS AT HOME AND ABROAD
 KNOWN TO GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FROZEN TO FRUSTRATE US.
IT HAS NOW DAWNED ON US THAT WE HAVE A VERY SERIOUS
 PROBLEM WITH GEN. OBASANJO'S GOVERNMENT SINCE THEGOVT
 BELIEVES THAT MY FATHER WAS THE PERSON WHO ROPED GEN.
 OBASANJO INTO PRISON FOR A FANTHOM COUP CHARGE AS HE
 NOW WANTS TO GET BACK AT US. MY FATHER'S CLOSEST
 FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES HAVE DESERTED AND BETRAYED US
 AND WE NO LONGER TRUST ANYONE.THEREFORE,I AM
 REQUESTING FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE AND HELP TO MY FAMILY.

 DEPOSIT OF USD (US$14.2M) FOURTEEN MILLION TWO
HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS WHICH HE MADETHROUGH DIPLOMATIC
 COURIER SERVICE TO A SECURITY COMPANY BASED ABROAD ND PLACED ON HOLD.
 BECAUSE OF LACK OF TRUST ON FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES,MY
 FATHER HAS MANDATED ME TO LOOK FOR A TRUSTWORTHY AND
 SINCERE PERSON WHO COULD HELP US COLLECT THE
 CONSIGNMENT FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY PENDING THETIME
 WHEN ONE OF US WILL BE ABLE TO TRAVELL OUT OF THE
 COUNTRY AND JOIN YOU FOR THE SHARING OF THE FUNDS.
  HE HAS EQUALLY MANDATED ME TO OFFER TO YOU 20% OFTHE
 FUNDS  FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE. ALL YOU ARE EXPECTED TODO
 IS TO COLLECT THE DEPOSIT DOCUMENTS FROM ME.THE
 DOCUMENTS WILL ENABLE YOU COLLECT THE TRUNK BOXESFROM
 THE SECURITY COMPANY BASED ABROAD ON OUR BEHALF.THERE
 IS NO RISK WHATSOVER INVOLVED AS ONLY MY FAMILY KNOW
 ABOUT THIS.OUR OWN SHARE IS TO BE LEFT IN YOUR CARE
 UNTIL ONE OF US IS ABLE TO FIND HIS WAY OUT OF THE
 COUNTRY TO OPEN NEW ACCOUNTS .IF YOU ARE INTERESTED,
 PLEASE SEND THE FOLOWING INFORMATION. (1)YOUR TEL/FAX NUMBERS.
