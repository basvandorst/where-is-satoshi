It is not that simple. What makes you think they generated exactly the
URL facebookcorewwwi.onion completely? They need to show some more
information about how they did it... There is also a chance that they
took a very long time to generate facebook*.
As I said, only they can tell us exactly.

@_subject: [tor-dev] Effect of padding on end to end correlation false positive rate 
Hash: SHA256
I have an idea which I want to put into a proposal, but need a
clarification first so I won't be working on something which doesn't
make a big difference.
I am describing something like a Sybil attack where the adversary runs
relays, gets lucky and is selected in a certain position of a certain
rendezvous circuit and can do an end to end correlation of the traffic
(both ends). This is different from one end correlation or website
fingerprinting attack.
For this scenario:
HS -> Guard -> Middle1 -> Middle2 -> RDV -> MiddleC -> GuardC -> Client
If the client is the attacker, and Middle1 is an evil relay colluding
with him, and it was selected 2nd hop in a rendezvous circuit that
connects the HS with the attacker (rendezvous is not colluding), he
can learn the guard of the hidden service. The client (attacker) can
send traffic over that circuit until he gathers enough data to make a
fair assumption about where the traffic is coming from (identify the
guard of that HS). I am not sure if there will even be a nonzero false
positive rate in this context. Confirmation needed for these
assumptions, this is what I think after reading: [0],[1].
Does this change with padding? If yes, how?
For the same scenario described above, if padding is used, will the
attacker have to own the entire path to the guard (Middle1 and Middle2
in the same circuit, since the rest of the path is under his control
to select anyway), in order to make a reasonable guess on which might
be the guard he is interested in?
Or can he make the difference between the real traffic and the padding
