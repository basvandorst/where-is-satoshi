Quoting Johan Wevers From Croatia.  Dekagram (decagram in english?) is commonly used for smaller
quantities of cheese and salami when you go to buy them in stores.  Most of
other prefixes are used too.  Deci for lenght and volume (usual glass sizes are
1, 2 or 3 decliters), I heard hekto (hecto in english?) used for larger volumes
of liquids (for example, by smaller wine makers).  Basically, I preatty much
heard of almost all the prefixes in normal range (from nano to tera) used for
various porupuses.

Sascha, North Americans don't dig really well into prefixes of metric system.  An example is that I always ask for 200 grams of mortadela in local stores.  Asking for 20 dekagrams (as I would do back home in Europe) is beyond conversion abilities of average North American.  And this is in Canada where metric system is officialy in use.  I can only imagine how bad the things are south of the border.  So, to put things in perspective, 100 meter (328 feet) wall becomes 0.05 meter (aprox. 1 31/32 inch) wall.
