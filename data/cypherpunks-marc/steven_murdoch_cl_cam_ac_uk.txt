I'm still highly unconvinced. If an institution has a policy that port scans are
suspicious and to be avoided, making the scans more stealthy could be
counterproductive. It might well make them harder to detect, but when they are
detected it will look even more suspicious. I'm also not convinced a slow port
scan will help much given that this is a common black-hat technique and thus the
sort of signature which will make it into an IDS.
Even if we could avoid detection, I don't see much of an advantage to a port
scan. Nowadays open ports are a very poor guide to actual system security. I'd
expect that practical security vulnerabilities will be the result of bad
passwords, old versions of daemons, insecure web applications, and so on; not
because someone has installed an inherently insecure daemon.

The scan which happened yesterday was enough to get the attention of both the
university network security team, and the sys-admins of the department which
hosts my Tor server. The last time this happened was 2009.
It's already difficult enough to host a Tor server, but triggering institutional
IDS is only going to make justifying the benefit of running a node harder.
