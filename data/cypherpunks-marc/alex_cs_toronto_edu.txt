@_subject: Re: [pfSense] naive suggestion: conform to US laws 
I have been following this discussion since the start and I have to say
that it has been very informative (mostly from a social perspective), but I
have been disappointed with the, um, vigorous responses from all sides.
The original post was somewhat blunt and probably could be labeled as
insensitive, and it could have been written with much better social decorum
(and for this an apology would be in order). Unfortunately the communal
response with some exceptions (thank you Chris) was equally missing in
generosity, sensitivity and decorum.
I suspect all of us are familiar with the realization that email can be
interpreted in the most unflattering ways despite the best of intentions...
and assuming TROLL intentions in this case I see as somewhat ungenerous.
Maybe this could be a good reminder to us all as to how even the best of
projects and lists are susceptible to issues of email misunderstanding and
how important great efforts of respect and decorum on all sides is
This article (although old) is a good reminder of how problematic this
issue is...
