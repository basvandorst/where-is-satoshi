@_subject: Re: latest Snowden docs show NSA intercepts all Google and Yahoo DC-to-DC traffic 
As a top-posting IT generalist pleb, can someone explain why Google/Yahoo did not already encrypt their data between DCs?
Why is my data encrypted over the internet from my computer to theirs, but they don't encrypt the data when it goes outside their building and all the fancy access controls they like to talk about?
Thank you for your feedback,
