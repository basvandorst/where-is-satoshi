You can refuse a search of your home, and the only way it can be searched is with a warrant where PC was shown and signed by a judge, or exigent circumstances such as a fleeing criminal into the home etc where things can be seen in plain view.  Apples and Oranges.

If that were the case, you could refuse the police to search your home, as
you may have incriminating evidence inside. From what I understand, the
judge's viewpoint is that it's similar to a search warrant, or making
someone provide the key or combination to a safe.  Christian Campbell

Only if the SCOTUS decides to hear it and does not uphold the 2nd DCA's decison, whom the case is currently being appealed to.

this will go to the SCOTUS as this is a 5th amendment violation.
