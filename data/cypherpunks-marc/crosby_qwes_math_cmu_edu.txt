There is nothing wrong in criticizing the united states. Nor is there harm
in different opinions. The response to propaganda by someone else isn't to
try to censor that propaganda, but to make people aware of dissenting
Sure, these guys sound like nuts, but we have free speech in our country.
As have I. they should not take the site down, they should not treat it
special in any way. We have free speech in this country.
Besides, I found the link interesting, just seeing how rebels view whats
going on... Each seems to be blaming their own enemies as possibly causing
WTC. So far, I've heard Israel and Russia blamed!
Its also scary just how little information there is, the misunderstandings
and propaganda elsewhere. People celebrating, without knowing what WTC
actually was. Or believing that we're living in fear, when we're furious.
Or believing that there is some oncoming war against muslims, not
realizing that we have millions of muslims in our country, just as furious
as everyone else.  Funky URL. Keep 'em coming.

That is the strength of america. The fact that we allow and even encourage
other, even critical, viewpoints to exist.
Communication and contrary viewpoints are the key. Communication so that a
population knows the atrocities committed by their own members. Make these
guys revolted by the terrorists in their own ranks and hopefully they will
help us suppress them.
BTW, I'm an american and feel no affiliation whatsoever to any aggrieved
ethnicity or religion in the world. I am furious now, but for good reason.
I think they're all nuts.
