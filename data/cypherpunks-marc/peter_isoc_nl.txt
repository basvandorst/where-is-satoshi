Old news.
Bitcoin was/is never anonymous, it was/is pseudonymous.
Tracking of Bitcoin was/is always possible unless countermeasures
were/are taken, like coinmixing. You can always use an AltCoin.

Yes, indeed rings a bell.     [ no pun intended ;-)Â  ]

This was probably due to mechanical (Strowger,
              Crossbar) mechanical switches.Â  Â Â  
              Â  Â Ã
Â These had a very limited ability to make connections;
              only a small proportion of telephones on a given switch
              could call each other at a given time.Â  Â I believe these
              were called "blocking switches".Â Â 
These things, called "switches", often had the ability
              to connect to 10,000 subscriber loops.
Later, electronic telephone switches allowed more
              extensive connections.Â Â  
              Â Ã
The big problem is, these switches might have been
              replaced only after decades of use.Â Â 
It probably didn't take all that many long-term (modem)
              connections to use up a mechanical switch's connection
              ability.Â Â

                 If memory serves me right, not only because some modems
                caused technical
                issues with installed telephone infrastructure. But also
                because the
                then customary flat rate for local telephone use meant
                that you could
                get on the Internet almost indefinitely if an Internet
                access point was
                within reach, f.i. university or library.
                This extra and sustained load could cause technical
                issues in itself,
                but it also cost the phone companies a pretty penny in
                lost income. No
                wonder the phone companies were quick to change their
                tariffs to usage
                based.
