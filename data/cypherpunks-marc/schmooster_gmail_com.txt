Hi all,
FTP, LTL, PBG!
I have had enough of the state of the United Kingdom - not to mention the
many other states across, around, and inside the globe some call Earth.
Those yet to be formed, and those beginning to form, in the near Earth
environment must not be excluded from our development as a collective.
I would like to be advised of my chances of establishing a United Kingdoms
organisation, tasked with maintaining human endeavours appropriately,
distinctly and in conjunction, with only a 100% agreement allowing the
exclusion of an artifact or ideal from the knowledge-base we share.
I'm really eager to outpace the UK general elections, any ideas around what
can be done to inch towards the above much appreciated!
and some love,
