@_subject: Re: Adding GPS location to IPv6 header 
While most of the people are trying to save the internet from any form of "goverment" and let it be free, this would be like shooting yourself in the foot.
This would be great for troubleshooting things...I agree, but other than that it would create a whole new plethora of privacy concerns.
We use the internet to express ideas either through our real life names or through alter-egos that give us anonymity and let us say things we wouldn't dare otherwise.
GPS data would just destroy any sort of anonymity that is left on the NET.
I can see big companies paying large sums for this sort of info...imagine google, facebook,etc having access to this kind of data.
"the host should have the option of not sending location updates."
Lets face it...how many people really know what a IP is, what it can do and what you can turn off or on?
Other than the IT sector, most other people do not care and they just This would just create a window through which you could implement such a feature and throw out most security concerns, because the people that actually care understand the feature and can turn it off...the masses are not so lucky and they get the BIG BROTHER treatment.
GPS header would have the same effect on IPv6 implementation as CGN.
While CGN and GPS data have the potential to make alot of cash for the ISP who implements it...we don't really want that in our lives and it would deter the customers from switching to IPv6 even more.
IMHO the Internet should just be free and offer full anonymity, else it would just come crashing down on our heads.
