Some Indian mirrors will be up shortly. Any other non-US volunteers?

Just taking a minute to plug  -- it is a
collection of Open Source crypto software for Linux, mirrored at 10
different (non-US) sites.

Does this include the free versions at, e.g,  ? If it does not, why should this make any great difference, apart from making NAI look like even bigger horse's asses than they already do?

I agree. In fact, the primary reason I use (and recommend) STARTTLS is to defeat logging by snoopy employers and/or clients.

I use Eudora, as I'm very comfortable with it (so comfortable, in fact, that it's my primary reason for booting Windows at all.)
The version I use, 5.1, *does* support STARTTLS for POP over both the regular port 110 as well as alternate ports, as well as user-defined ports. It needs some tweaking, but the capability exists.
I don't know about IMAP, as I don't use IMAP to get my mail.

I just got a batch of spam: perfectly justified blocks of random-looking characters. Makes me wonder if somebody is trying to train Bayesian filters to reject PGP messages.

Hasn't this already been going on a while? I'm only surprised there hasn't been a big public incident yet.
