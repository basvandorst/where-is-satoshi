XML is a pain to write by hand, for sure.  But one shouldn't be doing
that.  There are perfectly good libraries for working with XML in almost
every programming language.  It's a bit over-engineered, but one really can
represent almost any sort of data as XML.  (Whether that's a good idea is a
whole different question.)
YAML is a lot easier to write a small file by hand, but it's kinda brittle
& easy to fuck up.  Not nearly as expressive as XML either.  Great for
small config files; imho not so great for most other things.
JSON strikes a nice balance between expressiveness and human readability.
That's probably why REST (or if you eschew buzzwords, JSON over HTTP) is so
popular these days.

Attempting to compile such a list would be laborious and self-defeating.
It would invite compromise of the enumerated "secure" locations.
It would be more useful to compile characteristics of "secure public
spaces", and heuristics for locating them in one's local environs.  How can
we tell - without special equipment etc - if a given space is monitored?
If we land in an unfamiliar city, how can we correctly "guess" where to
find a secure public space?
On a recent trip I discovered a little 3' x 4' nook in the outside wall of
LA's Bonaventure Hotel.  Tho adjacent to areas of high pedestrian traffic,
the nook was unspied by any cameras.  No microphones or other sensors were
visible nearby.  A blissful respite from the otherwise panoptic
surveillance of urban California.
In this case we might speculatively take the hotel's Brutalist architecture
as the heuristic for finding similar spaces.  Although sometimes described
as an aesthetically "fascist" style, Brutalist architects loved to create
little difficult-to-surveil nooks & crannies in their buildings.  Alas many
of these spaces have been fenced up by the buildings' current Centrist
owners.  For example the contemptible disfigurement
of Boston's magnificent Government Service Center building.
What are other heuristics for finding secure less-surveilled spaces?

I've long believed that people should stop using the term "capitalism" when

I agree people should use the word "capitalism" more sparingly.  However
it's not because most people mean "free market" when they use the term.
Rather it's because *some* people mean "free market", whatever *that*
means.  Some mean "the dominance of economy and society by mechanistic
usury".  Some mean "democracy", whatever *that* means.  Some mean "American
style police state tyranny".  And some mean "the actually-existing
socioeconomic system in America today".
The profusion of definitions in use, and the sometimes fuzzy boundaries
between them, make the word "capitalism" not very useful for communication
without a lot of context.
