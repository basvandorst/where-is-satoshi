Hi all,
I try to respond. I'm one of persons who provided the implementation of
GOST to openssl in ssl.
No. The TLS will not be banned. It will not be regarded as good-enough
protection for communuications with goverment-related resources.
So in fact the implementors use current specification and use GOST
algorithms for PRF, cipher, MAC and auth. Most all are used according to
specifications, though sometimes there are some specific changes which are
to be hard-coded.
In most cases the IANA registry is a solution good enough for solving this
Thank you!
