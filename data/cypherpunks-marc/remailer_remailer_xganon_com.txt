@_subject: Zimmermann's guilty shame... what a farce. 
Hash: SHA1
Quoting the Washington Post Article: To Attacks' Toll Add a
Programmer's Grief...
Contributing to [the guilt] is the hate e-mail [Zimmermann] got
Sunday night.
It began, "Phil -- I hope you can sleep at night with the blood of
5,000 people on your hands." PGP has become a "weapon of war," the
e-mail continued, leveling the playing field between powerful
countries like the United States and "zealots."
Zimmermann read the words over and over again the next day, trying to
think of a way to respond. But in the end, the man who is known in
the technology world for his rousing speeches and meticulous debates
didn't know what to say.
* * *
You have GOT to be kidding me.
How about: "Sorry, I only accept e-mail encrypted to my PGP key. You
can obtain my key at  ?
Grow a spine, Phil, you jellyfish. You think Ford is upset because
their U-Haul truck was used by Timmy to blow up the Federal Building?
Tears in the shower? Please... spare me. This isn't a fucking Dickens
novel or the goddamn string section of the orchestra in an Elgar
piece. Do we have to get Brando to slap you around in the smoky back
room and tell you to be a fucking man? Unreal.
Oh, how the great (or at least those with decent PR acumen) have
fallen. Sad, very very sad.
None of you spineless dilettantes deserve privacy or freedom. Nearly
30% don't mind detention camps for legal aliens to affect a review of
their status? Sheesh. The United States so richly deserve the police
state that even now approaches that it will be a piece of lyrical
poetic justice if it does in fact come to pass. Bittersweet poetry
perhaps, poetry none the less. Land of the free my ass. Home of the
slave, I should rather think.
People, until the libertarian or privacy or crypto or whathaveyou
movements develop the same lust for the political (and actual)
jugular commonplace among their opponents they will ever be a
fractional and sidelined distraction. Nothing more.
September 11, 2001 fails to mark the end of the privacy movement only
if its proponents grow a backbone. None seems forthcoming. Zimmermann
should have hit the lecture circuit immediately with passionate
resolve for his cause, rather than being reduced to a withering pool
of Jello by some 90 IQ random with an AOL account. What a farce. To
think I once had respect for the man.
Shame on you for fostering a thinly-veiled anti-crypto op-ed piece.
You could of at least gotten 30 pieces of silver, rather than
settling for the kind of public sing-song sympathy more commonly seen
from the audience on the Jenny Jones show or the afternoon TV viewers
of a tearful "I have sinned against you..." public confession. I hope
it was worth it, you invertebrate.
And really, in the end, how absolutely arrogant of you to think that
you somehow reach the level of importance in world affairs that could
genuinely self-attribute a significant degree of responsibility for
the events of September 11th.
Again, I hope it was worth it. The price the rest of us may pay for
your insatiable vanity might be dear indeed.

There are two possibilities. Either Phil is a jellyfish or he's just
a naive self-promoting snake. In either case the best possible
scenario is that Phil is the one who fell for the oldest trick in the
book. He assumed the reporter would simply cater to his overbloated
vanity and take Phil's representations at face value, report them
accurately and otherwise refuse to impose any ulterior motive or
agenda on those comments. Shame on Phil. Shame on the press? Maybe.
The rest of us have to take the reporter at face value. He/she/it was
the one who talked to Phil on this occasion, not us. Too bad Phil
gave it the ammo it needed. Too bad. Pride goeth before the fall and
all that.
I am sickened by the number of people, including Phil, using the
events of September 11 to promote their own agendas or otherwise get
some face time with a camera, a mic, or a press and then pleading
innocent later. At least have the stones to admit that your being a
Machiavellian slime if you get busted. Christ.
Oh, I know quite a bit about Phil and I have met him and talked with
him one on one extensively at least thrice.
I have every right to call him a jellyfish, especially when he is
being one and particularly given his former spinelike resistance in
the face of great personal risk. That Phil is gone. Has been for some
while. (I'll wager he doesn't pal around with you on a regular basis
anymore either, Sandy).
Dateline: Silicon Valley, "Programmer more impacted by the deaths of
5,500 complete strangers than everyone else." What a load of shit.
How did he EXPECT the article was going to come out in the BEST case?
And then there's Sandy. Sandy, I have watched you as a supposed
advocate of freedom, libertarian ideals, privacy, anonyminity,
consistently bad mouth about every anonymous poster on this list who
has anything of importance to say. It never fails around here that
you will attempt to use their Mixmaster expertise against them. That
is the worse kind of hypocrisy on your part and I'm sorry (and not so
sorry) that you don't see it.
Those who earn it deserve it, no one else. There is no privacy
welfare program here. Even less so now. The government is not going
to protect your privacy. The health care system is not going to
protect your privacy. The courts are not going to protect your
privacy. Anyone who believes there is some fundamental right of
privacy recognized in the United States is either in fantasy land or
has been taking too much Thorazine for the last 50 years. (Jim
Choate, are you awake? Time for some Choate-o-grams on the bill of
rights).  A certain cryptographer PR maven of note once said "If
McDonald's gave away a free Big Mac in exchange for a DNA sample
there would be lines around the block." Sheep. Make your own privacy
you lazy idiots, or get none.
I have three talks in New York and one in Washington in the next 90
I'm sure you would like to, but I doubt you have gotten an invitation
to any of the three invitation only events.
You do not deserve one, at least not if you are as much of an
armchair "freedom fighter" as you appear in these eyes to be.
Sure, I have no doubt there are a series of Zimmermann apologists
here. I have little doubt that they will rush to Phil's aid. That
doesn't change the basic fact that Phil, like some kind of high
school graduate sports celebrity who has recently decided they are a
foreign policy expert and should be commenting to anyone who will
listen on the fate of Tibet or some other horseshit, decided he would
chime in about his own personal connection to September 11th. What a
big man everyone will think he is. Please.
Whine whine, the reporter misquoted me. Spare me.
Surprise, surprise he got burned (or didn't and is even more
spineless to shrink away from the backfire of his PR tactic). I have
no sympathy either way. I have no respect for that kind of behavior.
Nor should I. Despite the cute dissection of the article on this list
by Zimmermann Apologist  that reporter did not simply "make up" the
guilt line. Certainly, some liberities might have been taken with
poor-ole-harmless-Phil's dicussion (then again they may not have
been), but Zimmermann egged on the press. He got what he deserved if
he was misquoted as badly as represented here (which I doubt).
Grow a spine cypherpunks. Do something real. Attempting to snow
reporters to get yourself some press is not "something real."

@_subject: Libertarian Party versus Cosmopolitan Party 
I have been a libertarian for many years because it was the most pro-
freedom political movement available. But I have come to the
realization that even with a libertarian president and administration,
we are all dead.
Libertarianism is good; do not get me wrong. But because it is a
pragmatic party and not grounded in unmovable principles, it can and
has been penetrated by cryptically anti-freedom individuals: "socialist
libertarians," "environmental libertarians," and so on. The few
loopholes in libertarianism leave the door open to professional
manipulators called neocheaters who will continue usurping the value
producers and block biological immortality from rising in America.
January 1, 2002 is the official birth date of the Cosmopolitan Party.
This party is fully anchored in rock-solid principles of liberty. Its
political platform is an irresistible matrix of reality and honesty --
arising from reason and common sense -- all grounded in unassailable
reality. Thus, neither its candidates nor its adherents can debase it
with compromises on the most basic issue of liberty: individual rights.
Like looking into a crystal ball, the future becomes starkly clear to
anyone who peruses this platform. There is no alternative but the
liberation of all value producers in the United States, enabling market-
driven science to develop human immortality without interference by
anyone. Furthermore, this party's sound fiscal strategy will increase
the real wealth of all US citizens. We can add huge chunks of time and
money to our lives via the Cosmopolitan Party -- perhaps a 25% increase
in longevity by 2007 and a 33% increase in purchasing power by 2008.
As a side note, Omar and Osama are false targets. They are decoys,
foils. Khartoum and Tehran are the real centers of international
terrorism. By penetrating fifty countries within a few months, the
Cosmopolitan Party will become the religious-terrorists' worst
nightmare. Freedom and prosperity lovers, on the other hand, will learn
that the Cosmopolitan Party is a dream come true.

Peek-A-Booty, cDc's much vaunted anonymity app, is vaporware no more - it went public at the landmark CodeCon conference in San Francisco's DNA Lounge on Sunday. Peek-A-Booty is designed to let surfers access sites blocked by government restrictions, and is essentially, a distributed proxy network. It uses a peer-to-peer model, masking the identity of each node. So the user can route around censorship that blocks citizens' access to specific IP addresses, because the censor doesn't know they're going there. If you're a Peek-A-Booty node, you might be doing it on their behalf. So the software isn't itself a browser, but simply requires the user to use localhost in the proxy field of their preferred browser.

There has been an awful lot of discussion on this here in CP land, so maybe some responses too?
A good place to put forward suggestions to make hard calculations
a requirement of delivery or maybe some digicash to pay for it?
              *    *    *
This is copy of the message sent to IETF mail list. As subject said,
I'd like to organize IETF working group to define new additions to SMTP.
As everyone I'm sure have seen on the last "why is spam a problem" and
other similar threads on ietf as well as numerous similar threads on
other lists and boards, there is a serious need to do something to limit
amount of unsolicited email. While the roots maybe social issue I do not
see why we can not work on it from technical point of view. In addition
to that during last years, I'v seen real need for new features to be
added into SMTP, such as ones for callback, delayed transmission, delivery
notification,secure communications, etc, etc and there are in fact
several drafts available on some issues. As far as anti-spam  mechanisms I
do not belive we should force some particular method on everyone but
rather built several verification features into protocol and allow server
operators to themselve choose if they want to use it. Where the features
were use the email would be considered more secure and users can use that
to sort out mail (as many do already with special filters).
I believe its time we start working within IETF on new version of SMTP
that would have more features and be more secure. I'v tried to point this
out several times before on nanog and ietf hoping that someone would take
the initiave but as this did not happen, I'm willing to do it now. At this
point I'm proposing creation of IETF working group that would look into
ways to extend SMTP. I'v created website and mailing list to discuss
charter of the proposed working group at Those who agree with me, please subscribe to the mailing list and lets
work on this futher in a kind-of BOF. I'm also looking for two co-chairs
for the working group with at least one preferablly having been chair of
ietf group before. I'm planning on sending final draft for working group
charter in about two weeks time and right now I'm going to be contacting
several people who have expressed interest in working on SMTP protocol as
well as contacting IETF area director on proceeding with this.

Is it possible for you to visit

@_subject: Re: Signing as one member of a set of keys 
Steps to verify the "ring signature" file (note: you must have the openssl
library installed):
1. Save as text, to the file ringsig.c.  Delete the paragraph of explanation, and/or any
HTML junk, so the file starts with:
 *  * by Rivest, Shamir and Tauman
and it ends with:
 */
2. The "[...]" above is where a remailer caused some of the signature
to be stripped out.  Replace the last few lines of ringsig.c with the
text from
This has the lines from the END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK line onward.
The last lines of the ringsig.c file should be:
 */
3. Compile ringsig.c using the openssl library, to form an executable file
"ringsig".  Try running ringsig and you will get a usage message.
4. Get the two perl scripts from
and save them as "ringver" and "ringsign".
5. Run the ringsig.c file through the "pgp" program to create a PGP key
ring file from the PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK data.  With the command line
version of PGP 2.6.2 the command is:
pgp -ka ringsig.c sigring.pgp
This will also show you the set of keys, one of which made the signature.
*** COULD SOMEONE PLEASE FOLLOW THE STEPS ABOVE AND PUT THE ringsig.c,
ringsign, ringver, AND sigring.pgp FILES ON A WEB PAGE SO THAT PEOPLE
CAN DOWNLOAD THEM WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH ALL THESE STEPS? ***
6. Finally, the verification step: run the ringver perl script, giving the
PGP key file created in step 5 as an argument, and giving it the ringsig.c
file as standard input:
./ringver sigring.pgp < ringsig.c
This should print the message "Good signature".
7. How do you know what this means?  For that you have to read the paper
referenced in the program to become convinced of the theory, and then to
study the program to be convinced that it implements the algorithm in the
8. To create your own signatures, create a PGP keyring file which holds
your own key as well as the keys of other people that you want people to
think might have issued the signature.  They must all be RSA public keys.
Create a PGP secring.pgp file which holds just your secret key, and change
your passphrase on that key to be blank.  (This is temporary, you can
change it back or delete the secring.pgp when you are done.)  Then use
the ringsign perl script:
"./ringsign filetosign pubkeyfile privkeyfile > outfile"
This will append a signature to the file you are signing.  You also need
to make sure the recipient knows the pubkeyfile, so you may want to send
that separately, or include it in the file being signed as was done in
this case.
9.  Please report whether you were able to succeed, and if not, which step
failed for you.  BTW there are a couple of papers on ring signatures to
be presented at Crypto 02 so there might be some new improvements coming
to the code if the ideas look good.  One possibility is extending them
to work with DSS keys in addition to the current RSA keys.

@_subject: Discouraging credential sharing with Mojo 
Some credential issuing schemes, such as those from Brands as well as from
Camenisch & Lysyanskaya, try to avoid credential sharing by embedding
into the credential some secret which is important and valuable to the
credential holder.  Then if the credential is shared, the recipient
learns the important secret, to the detriment of the person sharing
the credential.  So he won't do it.
The problem is that there don't seem to be any secrets that will work
well in discouraging sharing.  The most obvious is a credit card number,
but this has a number of problems: some people don't have credit cards;
people could cancel their credit cards after receiving the credentia;
and underground hackers have access to thousands of stolen credit card
numbers that they don't mind sharing.
Clearly we need a new approach.  Here is a suggestion for a simple
solution which will give everyone an important secret that they will
avoid sharing.
At birth each person will be issued a secret key.  This will be called
his Mojo.  He will also get the associated public key which will assist
in protocols which involve commiting to his Mojo.  The public key can
be revealed but the Mojo should be kept secret at all costs.
Then in a credential issuing protocol, the user embeds his Mojo into
his credential in a provable way.  It is important that the protocol
not reveal the Mojo to the issuer, but rather that some kind of zero
knowledge proof be used so that the issuer is confident that sharing
the credential will reveal the Mojo.
Now all that is needed is a simple change to the law so that knowing
someone's Mojo makes him your slave.
That is, if you know someone's Mojo you own him.  You get access to all
his money and all his assets.  You can force him to work for you and
take all he earns.  You can mistreat and even kill him.  If he tries to
escape, the Runaway Mojo Slave act will commit the government to tracking
him down and returning him to you.
With this small change to the law, everyone will be gifted with an
important secret which they can use to bind and commit themselves in
a variety of protocols.  By embedding their Mojo into their secret
credentials, they can assure the credential issuer that the credential
won't be shared.  Mojo can also serve as an "is a person" credential
and allow for secure electronic voting and other protocols where each
person should only participate once.
Please join me in supporting this important reform.
Just say, "I want my Mojo!"

a nationwide search since Indiana law enforcement authorities distributed
copies of the videotape to the media earlier this week.
Gorman, who is believed to be affiliated with a Traveller group in White
Settlement and Fort Worth known as the Greenhorn Carrolls, is also wanted on
unrelated warrants in White Settlement and Fort Worth, authorities said.
Irish Travellers are descendants of a nomadic ethinic group that came to the
U.S. in the 1800s to escape the potato famine, roaming the country by horse
and wagon in search of itinerant work. Shiny trucks and travel-trailers now
carry them to the nation's distant corners and unassuming places like White
They are devout Roman Catholics who share biblical names, marry within the
group and speak their own dialect. Most of the men make their living in
home-improvement and business-repair work, such as paving, painting and
Law enforcement authorities said some scam their clients in the process.
Joe Livingston, a senior agent with the South Carolina Law Enformcemnt
Division who has investigated Travellers for 18 years, said there are
various subclans of Irish Travellers around the cournty.
"In Texas, they are the Greenhorn Carrolls. The South Carolina Travellers
are known as the Georgia Boys. In Memphis, they are known as the Mississippi
travellers. This girl appears to be a branch of Texas."
"How many are there?" he asked. "Who knows."
The Greenhorn Travellers -- the Carrolls, Gormans, McDonalds, Daleys and
Jennings -- found themselves in the spotlight in January 2000 when five of
their young members were killed in a wreck on Interstate 30 in Fort Worth.
The accident -- one of the worst in city history -- shocked the public.
Questions arose when authorities learned that none of the boys was older
than 14 and four of them were carrying false driver's licenses
misrepresenting their ages.
After the accident, some Traveller families withdrew their children from
area schools. Victims' families met with investigators only once.
Livingston, who is researching the Madelyne Gorman case, said he has
discovered that Gorman has driver's licenses in Indiana, Missiouri, Texas
and New Jersey. Computer searches reveal she has listed addresses in Mission
and Fort Worth; Elkhart, Ind.; and Independence, Mo., among others.
"This again, shows the transiency of these people," said Livingston, who
said he received a call from an informant Friday morning about the case. "My
guy says they've gone underground. They're not going to find this girl." In
addition to the arrest warrant out of Indiana, Gorman is wanted in White
Settlement and Fort Worth for unrelated crimes.
In White Settlement, a warrant was issued for Gorman's arrest on April 9
after she failed to pay a $202 traffic ticket. According to the city's
municipal court clerk, Gorman received a citation for no driver's license on
Dec. 12, 2001, in the 1400 block of south Cherry Lane.
The following month, Fort Worth police issued a warrant for Gorman's arrest
after she failed to appear in court to face theft charges, said Lt. Mack
West, of the Tarrant County Sheriff's Department.
According to a computer records and a Fort Worth police report, Gorman and
another woman, Rose Ann Carroll, were arrested March 27 at a Kohls
department store in Fort Worth on charges of theft $50 to $500.
