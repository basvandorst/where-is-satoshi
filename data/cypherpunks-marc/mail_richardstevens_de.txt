first, let me make one thing clear, I think what happened is very bad. They should have done anything else but secretly bug their system. But your logic is seriously flawed.
Very unpleasant for sure but also higlhly irrelevant. The people running AN.ON are German entities operating under German laws being situated in Germany. They were the ones that received the court order so they had to do something. If there are international users or not is really highly irrelevant in this case. Nobody claimed that German police or courts had juristiction in the US. Well, you can be sure, people are not pleased here, either. But do you really think if american police or better yet the FBI would demand some kind of tracking for an anonymizer in the US, they'd care about international users? Maybe the individuals operating the anonymizer would react better but I'd be surprised if american law enforcement agencies wouldn't use similar measures if they could by law (not sure about american laws). Not really. It's not a crime. You can argue about the correctness of their decision to secretly implement this backdoor in an *anonymizer* instead of standing up and tearing the service down. But following a valid court order is not a crime. Even though I really don't like those laws but spying on people seems to be hip after the events of Septembre 11th.
