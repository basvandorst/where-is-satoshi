Now you can know exactly whats going on when you cant be there, using our Digital Spy Cameras Our miniature surveillance cameras come already hidden inside smoke detectors, lighting, radios, clocks, etc. Perfect for asset protection, safety monitoring or insurance investigations.  Our digital cameras are used for covert or hidden surveillance. Normally used to monitor nannies / baby-sitters, employees, house keepers, etc.
You MUST protect your family, property and valuables!
Period.  No questions, qualifiers or conditions!
The hidden cams are high quality, providing high-resolution images so youll know WHO they are and EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE DOING.  With your digital cameras, the images are date and time stamped, a feature preferred by law enforcement professionals, private investigators, insurance companies and you can use it as evidence in courts of law!
Your unit will come complete with camera, transmitter and receiver. Unlike the popular X10 hidden cams, which compromise quality for low cost, our high-quality wireless cameras have scrambled signals so that you will be the only one watching.  Very important!
This is just the tip of the iceberg...  Prices start at $99!
