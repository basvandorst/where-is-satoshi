said, "How much is this?""Only a kiss a meter," replied the smirking man
assistant."That's fine." replied the girl. "I'll take for meters." The
assistant quickly measured the material, wrapped it and then gave it to the
girl. Taking it, the girl turned and pointed to an old man standing beside her. "MY grandpa will pay the bill." she said.
Billy and Bobby were small boys. They were brothers, and they often had
fights with each other.Last Saturday their mother said to them, "I'm going
to cook our lunch now. Go out and play in the garden - and be good.""Yes,
Mummy," the two boys answered, and they went out.They played in the garden
for half an hour, and then Billy ran into the kitchen, "Mummy, " he said,
"Bobby's broken a window in Mrs. Allen's house." Mrs. Allen was one of their
neighbors."He's a bad boy," his mother said. "How did he break it?""I threw
a stone at him," Billy answered,"and he quickly moved down.".
