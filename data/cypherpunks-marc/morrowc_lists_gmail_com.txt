so... with a carrier managed solution (or the one ATT/Sprint/VZB sold)
the transit of the attack happens inside their networks and isn't
charged to the end-customer (the destination, obviously contributing
customers get charged :) )

end customer sends the right community and mitigation happens...
remove the community it stops. no need to call someone and make it
happen, just have the NOC/etc at your network follow a simple
you are funny though :) (and I think you can call for free, 1-800
number, and get an engineer to make things happen for you as well...)

nope, the pricing (when I was there, and I don't think it's changed
much) is 3250/month for 500mbps or mitigation, though there was
~12gbps available easily before any work had to be done by the ISP...
If the plan I/sfouant put in place was followed you could had scaled
the capacity to much higher than that.
If a customer continuously abused the 'limit' they may have been
boosted to the next tier, but... I'd not ever seen that done.
3250/month... easy, peasy.

verizon's ddos service was/is 3250/month flat... not extra if there
was some sort of incident, and completely self-service for the
customer(s). Is 3250/month a reasonable insurance against loss?
(40k/yr or there abouts)

it seemed that the 'freedombox' was targeted at (or so I thought from
the snippet I read) striking a blow against regimes that cut off
network access during 'high stress' periods. A few kbps would still be
better than nothing :)
of course, a coffee grinder (or something more sophisticated that'd be
available to the repressive regime du jour) can wipe out that few kbps
easily enough as well.

This isn't really all that new is it? haven't people been able to buy

via some rainbow tables) several years ago as well.
If you ship it over the air and there isn't a reasonable encryption

sure, this isn't really in line with the idea I was getting at, except
that: "Hey, PRC located ips really might be using token-auth to login
to your systems, w00t!"
it might not, but discounting/dealing with all the cruft that today
takes up your ops-folks time easily/mechanically surely frees the mup
to focus on the things that they REALLY need to pay attention to...
Essentially, filter out the garbage, focus on the actual threats to
your business. The shared data pool COULD do that.
if you work for a corporation (in the US at least) ... the corporation
already has been monitoring your activities, you signed (in almost all
cases) a paper acknowledging that fact, w00t!
exactly... and if done right, the 'service in the cloud' (or whatever)
that aggregates, can do some bunches of that processing for you.

(note, people ought to: 1) think about this on their own making up
their own minds, 2) understand that the press has some very weird
ideas, 3) take some better protections on their own, for their own
also, I'm not judging the OP nor the reporter nor the ideas espoused
in the article/clips...

people keep trying, sometimes it's helped. sometimes reporters need to
sell stories :(
it's not just email they care about :( (you knew that I think)
one interesting idea, that has proven out some merit over the years is
the ability to share 'incident' data across entry points (say across
companies, or gov'ts even) about 'bad things' that are happening.
Take the case of 'spam came in from this end system to my mailserver',
if I tell you that (or some central system that which you can query)
you'll learn that maybe the inbound connection to you is also
the article sort of reads like the above scenario though... maybe it's
NOT that, maybe it's something else entirely... it SEEMS that the
gov't wants to help. They may be able to, they may just foul things
up. The reporter certainly didn't leave enough details in place to
tell :(
you may mean? could be... the wikipedias are sometimes wrong, or so
says the teacher of my 7yr old.
but hosts in the US that are botted/spamming, also spam/bot other
things outside the US, right? so really who cares where the src is,
get some data collection points up and use that data to inform your
security policy, no? (sure, you'll have to have some smarts, and some
smart people, and be cautious... but you'd do that anyway, right? :) )
These folks have some awesome tech for that sort of data collection
and analysis:
it's a shame that their parent company can't find a way to monetize
that sort of thing. (the article there talks about some older version
of the system, which is still alive/well today doing fraud detection
and was doing some IDS/anomaly-detection-like work as well for ip
network things)
translated: "Hey, what if we could tell our private sector partners
(Lockheed-Martin, for instance) that they should be on the lookout for
things like X, or traffic destined to Y, or people sending all their
DNS queries to these 5 netblocks." (dcwg.org sorta crap)
that doesn't sound 'bad', it sounds like there is a gap in the
business world to wrap all this data up and sell access to it... but
the gov't can jump in with their mountains of data from their
'einstein' or whatever and go to town protecting their 'partners' who
have often close interactions with the gov't, right?
adding to the above: "What if we had an API such that you could feed
your collected alarm/alert/badness data to us as well? and we could
feed that back into our system, protect ourselves AND send it back out
to the other partners?"
again, that's not that bad, really it sounds pretty cool... only if
MCI could have found a way to productize and monetize that... which we
built for them too :( but I digress.
alexander is loose with his pronouns, which makes this worse... in
reality: "send your alarm data to our system, hurrah!", PROBABLY this
could include large ISP people if the pricing (or regulatory world
were right), these folks COULD of course limit that to 'business isp
traffic only', maybe.
this sounds a little less on the ball though, so I'll blame bad
reporter-translation, and hope that Alexander really meant: "Our
partners in the industry, who help supply us and build our widgets for
us, would be enabled to send data into our API..."
I'm sure this was simply an example... and the reporter jumped on it
like a carnivore, poor job reporter! :(
 or
yes, put in the boogie-man! also, keep in mind that CI things are ...
in a horrid state, and as it turns out the folk running it are
ostriches :(

efit whatsoever assumes facts not in evidence.
 use certificates purchased from entities "under the thumb" of government c=
ontrol, clearly motivated only by profit, and with highly questionable mora=

k and confidentiality failure where such rosk did not previously exist.
backing up some, I think the problem trying to be solved by requiring
'legitimate' certificates is stopping the obvious problems of mitm
attacks, ala mallory-proxy.
in the longer term, if the client can know that the server was
supposed to present a cert with fingerprint XFOOBYFOOB and it can see
that fingerprint for the cert presented in the session we all win,

raising the bar for observers is potentially a goal, no?
making it simple for people to get 'more secure' email isn't a bad
thing. (admittedly, requiring a signed cert now is more painful,
though startssl.com makes it less so).
boiling down the above you mean:
goodness-scale (goodness to the left)
  signed > self-signed > unsigned
I don't think there's much disagreement about that... the sticky
wicket though is 'how much better is 'signed' vs 'self-signed' ? and I
think the feeling is that:
'if we can verify that the cert is proper/signed, we have more
assurance that the end user meant for this cert to be presented. A
self-signed cert could be any intermediary between me/you... we have
no way to verify who is presenting the cert.'
(note the use of 'we' here is the 'royal we', I have no idea what the
real reason is, but the above makes some sense to me, at least.)

wait, no... this was gmail's pop crawlers gathering mail from remote

so this is, I think, an attempt by gmail/google to protect their users
from intermediaries presenting a certificate for 'floof' self-signed
instead of iecc.com ...
