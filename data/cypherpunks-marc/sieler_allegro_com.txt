I don't mind a smattering of off-topic posts ... almost weekly, I point people with questions about classic computers (or with
classic hardware they want to get rid of) to this list ... people who don't want to subscribe.  Similarly, some members of
this list have benefitted from posting to HP3000-L (aka comp.sys.hp.mpe),
which *they* couldn't have done if it was closed.
Heck, I get a *HECK* of a lot more junk mail from existing ClassicCmp **"members"** posting to this list!  :)
