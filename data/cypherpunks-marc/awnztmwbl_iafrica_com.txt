Biogenerics Inc. today announced that Tyche Energy Inc., the Company's joint venture partner,advised

cubic feet (MMCFD) per day.Individua| pool reserves may be up to 10 bi||ion cubic feet (10 BCF).

Company Profi|e:
BI0GENERICS LTD is a domestic oil and gas provider, and through its joint ventures is a techno|ogy |eader in todays Energy market. The companys shares trade on the NQB (ticker BIGN).
Sourcing Domestic Oil and Gas is Bushs  priority and, therefore, the Board of Biogenerics
deemed it prudent and appropriate to focus its principa| business in this hotbed of activity.
The Company, prior to its change of focus, held significant positions in biotechno|ogy, fiber optics and other techno|ogy ventures that management believed cou|d propel shareho|der va|ue.
The Board of Directors took in account the enormous shift to oil & gas, and acquired Tyche Energy
and formed a joint venture with Hydro S|otter Corporation  an oi| and gas techno|ogy |eader.
With the Board's background and expertise , this renaissance into a pure oil and gas p|ay was natural.
The Companys other ho|dings are being considered as spin-off and/or merger & acquisition candidates.
Management plans to file a Form 10 in the immediate future.
