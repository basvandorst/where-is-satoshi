@_subject: Quantum Cryptography 
I've been lurking for awhile, but haven't seen too much on this subject.
There's this DC talk that I was thinking of attending.
Thoughts, references or white papers<3 ?

@_subject: Fwd: [tor-talk] victory at kilton library (grarpamp) 
Very happy to have read this in this mailing list.
This is a great with for Kilton, and I hope to get Tor Relays in SF Library.
Though DPR being caught there might make it a bit more difficult...
But I can't keep up with all these articles on mailing lists as efficiently
as I'd like to.
Does anyone know of a tool that makes reading mailing lists easier?

@_subject: Research Paper on The Eternal Life of Cryptocurrencies. 
I've been reading this mailing list for quite some time now, and usually
don't message or write here much. Maybe one other time.
I'm writing a paper on the vitality of Cryptocurrencies. My argument is
that they are here to stay, and will only continue to rise as our
technology becomes better. Some of the statistics I plan to use are the
growth in market value, not only in BTC, but in Altcoins as well, the pros
of BTC and how altcoins can do what BTC cannot, and lastly the versatility
of exchanging coins via places like Shapeshift.io.
Any suggestions on data or stats that might be useful? Shamir just said at
RSA, "Yet to see a use case for blockchain that can't be solved with an
existing simpler technology"
I simply disagree. I believe the use of Cryptocurrencies are not only a
statement against government control, but also a currency used by people
whom want to remain private. (obviously, again, better coins than btc).

@_subject: Snowden sasys FBI can unlock iPhone 
Is the technical part true?
I don't feel like it is...
Can anyone confirm this?
