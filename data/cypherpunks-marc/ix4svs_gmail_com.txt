Excellent stuff, thank you!
In particular well done for keeping it at just the right level of
complexity and not overloading it with information that will
confuse/scare away most people.
I like the idea of pointing people to this picture, asking them "do
you want THIS?" and then being able to point to the Tor Browser Bundle
as a one-stop solution that provides exactly THIS.
(Now all we need to do is somehow convince the other 99% of the
population that the "NSA", "police", "sysadmin" and "lawyer" icons are
not some privacy activist's pipe-dream but real threats)
