@_subject: Re: [tor-talk] Facebook brute forcing hidden services 
Here is an obvious question that I can't figure out.
Why would you use a service that cares nothing about keeping your details
They'll give you up to the state faster than you can blink.
If you are in a country that blacklists facebook, (china) logging onto
facebook should be the least of your concerns. TOR and facebook don't
belong in the same sentence.
Honestly if I was running an exit node still. I'd just add facebook to
nullroute right now.
