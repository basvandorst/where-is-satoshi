I'm curious. Is that asynchronous bandwidth? If it is what is your up
speed? You may not be contributing as much as you think. This is not to
say it isn't more than most people. In the USA most users have at most
25Mbps down and maximum up of 5mbps or so. I would bet most people really
don't have more than 1Mbps up in practice. 384-1Mbps is typical.

Maybe you should fix the router? This blaming other people for your own
mistakes is getting ridicules.
Yet, you don't drop it.
Yes, but this is out of context and time.

To be clear I didn't suggest this. It doesn't sound like a bad idea
although the question is what good if any would it do? Having some
compromised nodes is already assumed.
I think the concern is that if a significant number of relays can be
easily compromised then there is a reason to do this. It would be
'hardening' the network.
It doesn't matter if some relays are taken over and appear to be
not-vulnerable. The fewer that can be taken over reduces the risk of
encountering multiple compromised nodes in any given path. There are other
ways to achieve this. Setting up many many nodes for instance.

This is a dumb policy although that being said if this is going to have a
significant negative impact on the Tor network from a bandwidth or
security (loss of nodes could impact security too) then what about having
the Tor software do a check on the system? This would bypass the network
and avoid intrusion detection systems in place on the network. I imagine

This is far from the same thing. One is a place of work, rules, and
security. The other is an unregulated, unsociable, without a single set of
ethics place. You shouldn't be required (it can't be enforced anyway) to
abide by any set of ethics. The security you have is of your accord. If
you are attacked it is your problem. Nobody else. It is why it is so
important that you take responsibility for your own security and suffer
any consequences from the lack of it.

It sounds to me like you shouldn't be on the Internet. This attitude is
ignorant of reality, real security, and the ethics of the Internet. What
are the ethics of the Internet? There are none. It is not a single place
or group. You are the one taking the risk of being exposed to things you
don't like. Be it port scans, denial of service attacks, language you
dislike, ideas, fraud, or other malice. There is only one general law that
you will find applies everywhere in the world and that is treason.
Your view offends me. I however will not suggest you be denied access to
the Internet. That is what I agreed to by sending and accepting packets.
You are welcome to participate in the Tor network-or not. That is up to
you. You also accept whatever risks there are to running a Tor node.
I for one will not stop running a node just because someone port scans me.
It is up to me to protect my systems.

- Free State Participant Here (not in NH yet though) -
I actually was wondering if it wasn't FSP participants who were working on the relays in the first place... though that said on a prior brief attempt to identify the main participants in the library project I could find no obvious connections. However that doesn't surprise me. I've also not identified any participation by other individuals in the FSP despite seeming like highly likely participants (for instance Ross Ulbricht of Silk Road fame holds many views held by said participants and his mother has even talked at multiple FSP events post arrest).
Unfortunately I haven't gotten very far with another campaign regarding the FCC's efforts to force manufacturers to lock down devices on Free Talk Live (which does promote the Free State Project and is run out of Keene, NH). I called in briefly as the show generally doesn't do interviews / talks and like many other shows. Rather they let anybody call in about anything (ie the name Free Talk Live). That said I'd still encourage people to call into Free Talk Live. Multiple people coordinating it would be a smart move and I'd be happy to participate in such a campaign to 'target FTL' (they wouldn't object).
The site and call in # can be found at  and the show airs daily on the east coast from 7PM-10PM 7 days a week.
There are other FSP media outlets (ie libtery-minded outlets heavily involved in the FSP). The Free Talk Live show seems to be the most outstanding from FSP events I've attended (ie they show up to Porcfest in the summer, which is an FSP summer camping event, and Liberty Forum, another winter event, traditional conference style).
* Also just noticed in on the site that there is a link to an article on the issue already.
Another show is Freedom Phoenix. I've had a lot of luck here, but I believe it is out in Arizona (ie phoenix). Not sure who in the NH region if anybody listens to it, but I know they've covered Porcfest before. I've been on the show twice and will be on for a third time this coming week (Tuesday September 15th) to talk about the FCC's efforts to ban free software (practical result/outcome of rule changes, not specific objective necessarily).
