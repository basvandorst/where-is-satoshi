From what I understand about MegaUpload's approach, they created a hash of every file that they stored.  If they'd already got a copy of the file that was to be uploaded they'd just put an appropriate link in a users space, saving them storage space, and bandwidth for both parties.  Fairly straight forward.  Whenever they received a DMCA take-down they would remove the link, not the underlying file, so even though they knew that a file was illegally hosted, they never actually removed it.  That comes up for some argument about the ways the company should be practically enforcing a DMCA take-down notice, whether each take-down should apply to just an individual user's link to a file or whether the file itself should be removed.  That could be different from circumstance to circumstance.

Ars Technica are implying it was quite a source of bandwidth usage within companies.  I'm curious, are any interesting charts on an ISP side?
