I proposed essentially this idea around 10 years ago on the capabilities
list, using custom TXT records and some hackish things that  are/were
sub-optimal due to DNSSEC being more of a pipedream then than it is now to
deliver public keys for any arbitrary purpose. I only went so far as to
kick around design ideas on and off-list back then under the tag-line of
objectdns (as in being able to locate and connect to any arbitrary object
via a public key crypto connection) and registering the domain objectdns.com.
Things stalled out there due to my lack of copious free time.

Virtual private servers are a very big problem. Virtual machine deployment
systems at very large hosting providers have been found to use the same
not re-seeding from /dev/random on provisioning, and running with the same
seed as was in the VM template when it was 'cut'.
I know because I fixed it at places I worked as a contractor. I know at
least one competitor had the issue. No knowledge if it was ever fixed
there. Don't trust seeds you didn't generate. Think about Amazon AWS
instances all spinning up on demand with the exact same init code and prng
seed (this example is not the ones i dealt with, butnis perhaps a larger
problem). You always have a window after startup where you can predicte the
state of the kernel level prng. Not a big one, but it is real and in the

Arrgh,
Sometime in the last two months I described the somewhat widespread issue
at VM hosting/cloud providers of provisioning VM's with the same
get run at image generation, and then the urandom seed is frozen in amber,
as it were, in the VM image template file. It is a fairly trivial fix to
re-seed it from /dev/random (one line in the right place).
The obvious place to do that, when the VM is actually provisioned, ends up
hurting deployment time due to sometimes blocking on /dev/random reads to
re-seed /dev/urandom. This has led people to toss up their hands and do the
Wrong Thing of just provisioning, sometimes thousands, of VM's with the
same /dev/urandom seed.
Quequeing up pre-provisioned system images with the one liner to re-seed
related config can happen here, too) takes care of it, but then you get
people whining about shuffling around image files rather than quick copy on
write delployments of VM images.
Then someone at that provider has to realize you just do the queueing
per-storage system used by each hypervisor host against copy-on-write
images. This chain of logic and refinements thereto have not, to my
knowledge, been written up in any widely known best practices document. I'd
love to be shown somewhere they have to point people at if it exists.

Easier than you think. Nearly all DSL modems use the ATM protocol to
connect to the telco network. The ATM switch, if not the modem itself, can
usually be configured to setup virtual circuits that mirror traffic from an
interface or another virtual circuit.
So all that would be needed is for your local Older Brother to get the
telco to setup their network to allow them to turn up virtual circuits that
pre-configured to send either local LAN switchport traffic or mirror your
WAN traffic. It's a config option, no subversion needed. My past life in
network engineering let me confirm in a minute or 3 via google that at
the very least Juniper gear can do this. I doubt Cisco would leave out such
a feature. There are of course non-surveillance use cases given for all
such things.
And we're now off in infosec land off of the crypto path, and I'll just
leave it there.

GPG Tools integrates gpg with Mail.app and other OS X apps very well. It
signs mail by default and offers encrypt as an option if any recipients are
in your keychain. But yes you have to restart Mail for it to work too.
