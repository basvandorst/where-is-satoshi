* Neil Johnson  [020302]:
This ground was covered (Hi Tim!) a loooong time ago. Look here:
for a rather recent summation.
What does this boil down to? It boils down to E-bay not knowing what the fuck
they were doing, and buyers following them off the cliff. Reputation isn't the
same value for everyone, or it shouldn't be. If you check out the slashdot
threads on it (lost the link, search works fine), you'll notice even there
buyers doing a crude method of evaluation of people who gave this seller
positive rep. One guy apparently even made a PHP script to detect short chains
of pretty blatantly obvious reputation wank circles.
Is this problem incurable? No. Is it incurable in its current form? Absolutely.
The system is built up around the concept that one _can have_ a rep value that
is just a number that means the same for everyone. That concept is bullshit. Oh, and as far as the terminology of reputation vs. belief, if it bothers,
global search and replace is your friend.

You're right. Dell Corporation isn't a person. It's a group of people. It's no
different from a group of people. Things like selective selling to customers on
the part of corporations follow trivially from free association and the
individual ability to decide those things.
You're attacking a point that isn't even related to anything.
And you bathe in your own.
