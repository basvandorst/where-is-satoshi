Indeed and I hope they share too - I didn't mean to imply any knowledge of
the incident, just explaining in plain language why brute forcing is
involved, to people who are confused.

So called 'vanity' addresses are essentially a brute force - generating
tons of keys until you get one that starts with the prefix you want. The
difference is that 'bob1d8rhdu2h.onion' is a lot less specific than
facebookwwwi.onion - if Facebook can brute force arbitrary strings like
that, they can instead brute force, say, , or
 and then impersonate it.

On the contrary, it makes me feel that my freedom is being used to
provide an environment where some of the damage done by people with your
misguided viewpoint can be mitigated.
