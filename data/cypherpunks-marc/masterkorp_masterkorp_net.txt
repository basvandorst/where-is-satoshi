@_subject: Re: [tor-talk] Tor -> VPN Clarification 
I use VPN -> Tor if the the end point is outside in network.
I use Tor-> VPN if the the objective is to use the VPN as a VPN, so all
the end points would be inside a LAN or also connected to a VPN. In fact
then the VPN server would be an Tor hidden service.
