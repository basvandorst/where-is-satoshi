Hi Cypherpunks, Managing Chronic Pain. Keep a Pain Journal: Record the various activities and therapies that reduce or alleviate your pain. A journal also helps track the ebb and flow of pain, so you are aware of them and know when the pain worsens and how to ease it.
We believe ordering medication should be as simple as ordering anything else on the Internet: Private, secure, and easy.
