Having worked as a security administrator at an ISP which had a dialup subscriber base of around 300,000, I can tell you that this is not a simple task.
Like most organisations, the networking component grows sporadically as the need arises. This is the same for an ISP. This makes implementing something that works across the board very difficult, due to the "evolved" nature of the network.
Implementing something like filtered incoming traffic against hacking attempts means you straight away have to look at a network IDS. Such beasts are not only costly, but until recently have been very difficult to implement over high-bandwidth links. The ISPs have only three options - allow all, deny incoming connections to "vulnerable" ports (HTTP, Netbios), or filter everything.
It would be a nightmare to implement a network IDS for most of the larger cable and dialup providers, and that's the reason you see many of them starting to block incoming connections to the problem ports.

Does this mean that if you are a private researcher, and reverse-engineered something for fun or the challenge, you escape the clutches of this law?
