I would check out Bitmessage which gives you anonymity and is censor resistant
and can be configured for Tor usage. You can create also public chans (channels) for discussions, but those can easily
been spammed, from people who do not like Bitmessage.
Another option could be ZeroNet.

Hi all,
after watching Mr Snowden's YouTube video and reading the following article,
I was wondering if a factory reset and a new SIM card would be good enough,
or should a compromised mobile device no longer been used and instead one
should buy a new one with a new SIM card?

Privacy/Security/Anonymity costs money.
How about two phones, one compromised and the other one without a SIM-Card
and WiFi/GPS tracking disabled and (encrypted and anonymous usage) message
creation is done on the second offline phone and transfered with a serial
USB cable and Terminal Software, which shows the bytes amount transfered.
This way also very small encrypted Voice messages can be created on the
offline phone, then spoken via the compromised phone.

I would like to add the following. People who are involved in secure
communication on the Internet today and who are new to this topic, do
not learn that security, such as privacy or anonymity etc. a) costs
money and b) should be used in conjunction with offline devices.
Surely licensees of tools like FinFisher or Pegasus could confirm
that cryptography on online devices like smart phones or computers
might be quite useless.

The majority of GnuPG users no longer use SKS key servers, due to the
fact of possible attacks on their pub keys. It seems SKS key servers
are nowadays only used for censorship resistant communications.
Todays popular key servers are:
keys.openpgp.org or keys.mailvelope.com, besides Werner Koch's WKD.

Hi Karl,
The range of these little NFC tags is only a few centimeters/inches.
and I guess if someone could (in theory) listen to your offline device,
then it does not make any difference IMHO if you use and additional
NFC reader/writer and your offline device.
The reason why I mentioned NFC tags is that they fit nicely on postcards or
in letters (and can be protected with covers), can be password protected
and also allow encryption, depending on the type used.
Well, a while ago I looked for options to work with an air-gapped
computer, but was not sure if one should use a secure USB stick,
for example and found this FTDI solution. I ordered such cable
relatively cheap from alibab.com, because here in Europe these
cables are only sold to companies, which can re-sell them and
the price tag is much much higher.
Nice, will take a look.
With audio cables I have also experimented and with HTML based software
run in a browser. But this was error prone and the transmission speed
was to slow. IIRC correctly the popular FOSS software minimodem can do
this too, but is unfortunately not cross-platform.
Yes, but can nowadays devices (Raspberry Pi for example) handle CDs?
Will check that out too.

Thanks for your reply, much appreciated!
I think the problem nowadays is that when it comes to crypto etc.
you won't hear from well known Cryptographers or Programmers, in
this field, how to use Cryptography properly.
I, for example, can use unbreakable pen&paper cyphers and as TRNG
scrabble tiles, pulled from a bag, and additionally to be able to
copy pads an 50' mechanical typewriter with blue paper instead of
hand writing them.
Best regards

GnuPG should be already installed with Linux (Raspberian OS etc.). The
thing I would like ask you, how would you communicate securely with your
air-gapped device?
What I did in the past was to install on the online device and offline
device the free (cross-platform) software CoolTerm and I connected both
devices with an FTDI USB to USB cable, so that I could do serial communications
and was also able to see how many bytes (from a PGP message) was transfered.
Another approach I am currently playing with is to play with NFC tags and
a reader/writer device, which can be used offline as well.

Most interesting with what you came up with, because my MUA saves then
your message as it should be. However, unfortunately the included hash
does not match. :-(
BTW. are you aware that the NaCl crypto library has also a sign function?
It would then require a second key, same as with GnuPG, but maybe also
worth to explore, because you are a programmer.
Here is a sample implementation in Golang, which unfortunately writes
the signature as binary instead of (base64) ASCII.

Well, I often receive message in PGP format, because I still have a key
pair for GnuPG. Otherwise I already use NaClbox with friends in Germany,
the United States and Canada. :-)
Regarding the ML, I think the list-owner would not be amused and probably
many subscribers would not like the idea either. For that people could use
the Usenet group alt.anonymous.messages with a shared hashed subject (hsub)
in order to fetch messages, from a.a.m..

BTW. NaClbox messages are authenticated, so no one can send you a message in
my name, if they are not in possession of my private key. This avoids then
also to use signatures, like with GnuPG.
And the IMHO cool thing about NaClbox is that it is much easier to use and
learn than GnuPG.

$ box seal -from Karl -to Stefan SEALED, which then writes
a binary authenticated encrypted blob and which I could only open
then if I would be in possession of your pub key. It is also advised
when you send me such message that you consider to base64 etc. encode
it, prior sending/posting.

Using a Raspberry Pi is always a good idea, because it is affordable for most of us.
And did you received good feedback for your proposal?
Other Networks, besides Mix-Networks and which are censor resistant and offer
anonymity too are Bitmessage, which could be seen as alternative to email and
Usenet and ZeroNet, which could act as additional WWW services. Both are easy
to use and one only needs to install the clients. Can be coupled with Tor too.
i2p so it seems has not so much users (anymore) if I am not mistaken.

An alternative to Tor could be the Nym Network, once in production.
The Nym team is a good team and have well known researchers in the
field of anonymity.
At least it is a project worth to follow, IMHO. I do run a mix-node
there myself and plan, once a bug issue is fixed, to run an additional
SphinxSocks Proxy server.
