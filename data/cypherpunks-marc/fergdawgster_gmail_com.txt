On Sat, Dec 4, 2010 at 9:02 PM, Adrian Chadd No -- iin the U.S., if you even reveal that you have been served with a
National Security Letter [1], you are in violation of the FISA [2] court
under the Patriot Act.
"Ask" is not the word I would use.
Fun stuff, eh?

On Tue, Dec 7, 2010 at 8:32 PM, Patrick W. Gilmore After I laughed for a minute or two, you're exactly right -- although the
social & political issues involved go far beyond IRC.
Witness the back-and-forth DoS attacks involving Wikileaks and
Anti-Wikileaks proponents going on right now.
But this is not a new phenomenon -- every time there is a perceived insult
or slight against Chinese pride/culture, it always spurs some sort of DoS
attack scenario with grassroots support.
These sorts of attacks have been going on for years, and will escalate far
into the future, methinks.

On Thu, Feb 3, 2011 at 10:34 PM, Martin Millnert In this, we completely agree.
And as an aside, governments will always believe that that they can control
the flow of information, when push comes to shove.
This has always been a hazard, and will always continue to be so.
As technologists, we need to be cognizant of that fact.

I am making no argument to the contrary.
But I should caution you that there are forces at work currently which are
making motions to federalize this authority.
I think we all should be deeply concerned -- some of this
pandering/politicizing/scar-mongering can have ill effects.

On Thu, Feb 3, 2011 at 9:27 PM, Mark Newton I share your sentiment.
One of the best commentaries I have read lately on this issue was earlier

Worth a quick read.

On Thu, Feb 3, 2011 at 9:26 PM, Matthew Moyle-Croft The Internet is not immune to the law, as you should well know. In fact,
the Internet seems to be a legal "proving ground" these days, so word to
the wise.

On Thu, Feb 3, 2011 at 9:09 PM, Mark Newton No. The correct answer is that in the U.S., if the Agent in question has a
valid subpoena or N.S.L., you must comply. If he doesn't, then you do not
have to comply.
I cannot answer for any other jurisdiction.
Also, make sure you have staff attorneys well-versed in Internet law --
you'll need them either way.
