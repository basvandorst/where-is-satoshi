Let me recap to see if I really got it right:
the sender does:
- generate a random single-use keypair
- generate a random secretbox key
- secretbox the message 32k-wise with the former
- box that key for each recipient
- put into the output the cipher, the recipient stuff
  and the public key part of the random single-use keypair
Is that right?
So, in order to communicate with someone, only user A has to publish her
public key. User B takes it, box()es a message for her, puts his
(random) pk into it and sends it. A then uses the public key included in
the message plus her own secret key, decrypts the message and drops B's
public key afterwards.
Because, usually with curve25519 both A and B had to exchange their
public keys in advance to be able to communicate. The scheme above makes
it a lot easier for users but is it sufficient securitywise?

Nope, the sender's public key is included by pbp with the encrypted
message. Since yesterday pcp does the same. However, I use a dynamic
keypair on the sender site now. I'm currently in the process to change
the encrypted output format of pcp to match the one of pbp.
Absolutely. Speaking of mistakes: I had even a note in the manpage where
I mentioned that it might be a bad idea to include the key-id with
encrypted messages, though I totally forgot it :) Oh - and I didn't
really include the key-ids, but a hash from it instead. However, this
has already been changed.
Well, now you know, I don't like linux :)

We're not talking about RSA, do we?
As I alredy said, it's no problem to have separate keyspairs for signing
and encrypting, just a couple of lines to change.
Ok, let me formulate it better: I can use a single-use keypair on the
sender's side and include the public part in the message. Cool. But the
sender would nevertheless need a public key from the recipient. This one
has to be from a long-term key, since we're operating in a
store-and-forward environment. But it doesn't make sense to use a
single-use key only on one side of the communication, does it?
As a sidenote, in pcp it's possible to generate a keypair for one
recipient (it's derived from the long-term keypair), so you'd at least
have one keypair per peer. But it's unclear to me, how to use single-use
keys on both sides of a communication in a store-and-forward
environment. Any hints? Really? I'll try it, but if this is the case, then it's bad indeed.
Yea, I see.
ok, got it.
Come on, have a heart. The only thing I "invented", was how to store
keys and encrypted files. It's just a fun project in it's early
stages and everything can be changed. And I'm really glad when someone
points out some errors I made.

Well, the libsodium developers not only told me how to do it, it was
their idea. However, it's of course very simple to generate them
That's the way curve25519 works. It would be possible to use one time
keys but for this there has to be some kind of key exchange process
before. But since pcp runs in offline mode, I'm not sure how to do this
in a user friendly way.
No, it doesn't. In order to decrypt a message one needs the recipient
secret key and the sender public key.
While I don't know how stef does it in pbp, I only add the key id to the
cipher so that the recipient knows which key has to be used to decrypt.
I'm not sure how it is bad to publish a key id. That's daily business
with pgp as well.
Again, this is how curve25519 is designed.
The sender needs a public key from the recipient anyways. And to be able
to decrypt the message, the recipient has to retain her secret key. Funny, but neither I nor stef invented anything. DJB did. - Tom

Content-Disposition: inline
more than fine with me.
I'm currently using big endian for multibyte values whereever they
appear. It's already verified to work on little and big endian platforms
(e.g. tested on aix/ppc)
Could you please explain this further?
In pcp there's already such a hint included in exported keys, however
I'm not using it, since there's no choice of different curves in
libsodium so far. But it's on the list.
As already stated in the other subthread, I use Z85, while stef is using
base85. Since Z85 is a subset of base85, I'm pretty sure we can agree on
There's a human readable version of keys in pcp, but the tool itself
doesn't use it (example attached). It uses the z85 encoded binary part
of such a file.
pcp has some more fields stored in a key than pbp:
- a key id (e.g. 0x54E9C62E1852EBC5) which is required to identify a key
- some text fields (owner, mail)
- a serial number
- key format version number
I'm not sure, how stef solved the ed25519 issue (you can't use a
curve25519 secret key to create an ed25519 signature directly). After
some discussion on the libsodium mailinglist we came up with this:
When the user generates a new key, the ed25519 secret key will be
generated first. The curve25519 secret will be derived from that, since
the ed25519 already contains a usable curve25519 key. In pcp I store
both of them for easier access, so the ed25519 and curve25519 secret and
public keys are stored, the secret keys are encrypted and I store the
nonce as well (see include/pcp/key.h).
Speaking of key encryption:  according to your docs you're already
using scrypt() for key derivation. I'd like to use that as well, but
it's not part of libsodium (afaik), so I use my own method for this til
scrypt() is implemented in libsodium. That's because I want to avoid
writing crypto code myself.
Maybe we should iron out the details off-list?

a short update about the progress. I've made the following changes to
pcp[1] so far:
- asymmetrically and symmetrically encrypted files are now created in
  the same format as pbp does (binary output only). Verified to work
  with symmetric mode only because of some open issues.
- the same applies for signatures, binary only as well. pcp has another
  format for armored sigs (which I like better).
- crypt+sign is supported now as well (pcp only).
- pcp can import and export pbp public keys.
- encryption keys are derived using scrypt().
- crypto and signing keypairs are generated separately.
The todo list contains a bunch of open issues anyway:
- we still need a consistent pubkey file format.
- we also need an agreement on armoring (base85 va z85).
- cipher mode: currently pbp (and pcp now) encrypts data in ECB mode
  with a blocksize of 32k. I think CBC would be better, and I already
  implemented it (enabled with ./configure --enable-cbc). We'd need an
  agreement here as well.

@_subject: Re: consistent pcp/pbp formats 
Good, I changed the scheme then. However, instead of adding the
recipient list to the signature, I add it to the hash, since I
sign the hash only anyway; and because it is a) easier to code and b)
results in a signature with a static size.
So, now the signature looks like this:
nonce|crypto_secret_box( crypto_sign( crypto_generichash(cleartext + encrypted-recipientlist) ), nonce, symkey)
Everything else is unchanged. So, an encrypted+signed file contains the
number of recipients, the recipient-list (which consists of the
pk-encrypted ephemeral key per user), the 32k-blockwise sym-encrypted
message, followed by the encrypted signature. As usual the nonce used to
encrypt the sig is prepended.

"came", they've been brought), caucasians came from europe, the natives
even came from siberia (50.000 years ago or something). Those migrations
happened all the time during the last 2 mio years over human history.
Therefore, to claim to have a right to live in a uniform culture,
undisturbed by newcomers, is arrogant and absurd. And even if such a

times. More and more people pay attention to the environment. Who did
that 100 years ago? Nobody. Who did protest against forest clearance in
those times? Nobody. Against discrimination? A handfull. The list is
The difference to past times is this: 100 years ago children got missed
all times, every day. The general public didn't care much, or even
notice. Today, if a child gets lost, all the media - sometimes even
international ones - report about it, every day 24/7, for weeks.
This is the cause of the perception "oh my god all this criminality!"
while in reality there's LESS criminality than ever before.
You might counter: but what about unreported missing black children? What
about the desastrous violence in Venezuela and Mexico? What about all
those global warming deniers? What about the rising fascisim in the EU?
What about idiots like Trump or Farage? Yes, these things must be fixed.
But if you "zoom out" a little and look on the big picture, you'll
realize that we as a species are developing, growing and indeed getting
Well, at least this is as I see it. I just hate it that almost every one
laments all day "we're going to die, the past was so much better" and

Today is the best times of all. Todays poorest people are rich
compared to poor people a couple of centuries ago.
So, I don't need to believe, I know it's getting better. Even if local
situations might be worsen here and there, this doen't matter that much

On the other hand, greed is the primary driver which led us humans where
we are today. Without it, we'd surely still be hunter-gatherer's living
every day on the edge of extinction.
So, fighting greed might not work.

Of course an 88 years old physicist specialised in electricity is *the*
authority when it comes to climate science. Now all other 97% of climate
scientists have to abandon everything they know about the issue.

In the end you'll need to compare them yourself, features, policies,
hardware support, security, whatever.
I just happen to like FreeBSD more and Theo de Raadt less :)
Why, pretty good I'd say. Replace "FreeBSD Users" with "human beings" and the sentence might be
true. Of course there are uncaring FreeBSD users, as are uncaring
Windows, OSX or OpenBSD users.
Oh - and not caring about security doesn't lead to an insecure system
neccessarily. Many years ago we made an audit of some BSDi machine: it
had all patches installed and was top secure. However, nobody have been
logged in since a couple of years. So, why was it so secure? Because:
0 * * * * cd /usr/src && make world
I'm not sure about all those things, google will help you with details.
Maybe HardenedBSD, NetBSD or - as you're already using - OpenBSD might
be better suited from this perspective.
There's bhyve. I use jails and am very happy with it.

I use it at home and we use it at work (hundreds of FreeBSD boxes).
It is stable, maintainable, good to update, has pretty good hardware
support and superior performance.
FreeBSD has a way larger developer community and is in wide use,
especially by companies. You didn't ask, but: if you ever use FreeBSD for a longer time, you'll
never go back to Linux. At least not voluntarily :)

In a referendum swiss citizens agreed to the latest surveilance law
(NDG). According to the new law NDB (swiss intelligence service)
will be allowed to:
- open letters
- intercept phone calls
- intercept sms
- install bug devices in apparments
- install troyans on computers and mobiles
- apply gps trackers to vehicles
- live-search of communications like mail or chat
- interrupt & attack networks (domestic and foreign)
- store all collected data for 6 months
- companies are obliged to comply with surveillance requests
- no more protection of lawers or journalists
- and a lot more
65% of voters agreed with the law.

Same here in germany. But it's even better here: while they claim to

there, because it only applies on the ground (nobody really understands
this argument). So, shoot a drone or launch your own rocket and go to

Ok, makes sense.
If I can learn something new, does it really matter, who paid for it?
Yeah, I'll build my own orbital telescope and count galaxies :)
I see. This particular example might be the wrong one. The problem we'd
need to discuss here are the media. Of course, if one study says
something "might have happened" this is no fact. However, media
immediately report about such singular studies as if it were.
Also, somewhere else someone stated, that science is about finding the
truth. But this is false as well. Science is about theories and
confirming evidence, experiments and studies. However, they remain
theories. This is the core of science: a serious theory must be
falsifiable. That is, even theories as the "theory of relativity" or
"global warming" might some day fall apart when someone finds evidence
which contradicts it. But in the meantime science works with the
consensus (we had this point already in the climate thread), since you
must work with something.
So, did humans hunt cave lions? I don't know. But I know one thing: we
humans are the most dangerous species on this planet, so why not? We
kill everything, including our own fellow humans.
I am curious about this, but we digress :)
I don't deny this. However, the knowledge they acquire is good for all
of us, wether you're interested in astronomy or not. I understand your
point but I cannot reject all NASA does just because they are government
Yes, I do. The question is, who shall fund them instead? Corporations?
That's just the same shit. Crowdfunding? Will never happen. There'd be
no science at all without funding. We'd still be hunterers and gatherers

As I understand your mails, you're  one of them. Maybe I misunderstood

Why should I make propaganda? I'm not the government nor do I work for
one. I just happen  to love science. Here are a  couple of examples of
the kind of science I wrote about earlier:
How could a sane person think they are 'parasites'? This is nonsense.
Let me fill in the role you're projecting onto me for a moment: please
show me the evidence of your propaganda claim.
I  don't. I  just say  not all  science is  evil. We'd  not have  this
discussion otherwise.
I'd love it to see you on the panel during a science convention or the
like and speak like this to scientists :)
Really, Juan, I  surely agree with you, that there  are scientists one
could call 'parasites'. But not all of them, that's ridiculous.

Hello Kevin,
Ah, great. However, there are a couple of people on the list, who do. My
mail was merely directed at them, not at you personally. Sorry if it
sounded that way!
Well well well, but I'd like to disagree (a little) - yes, the economy
and politics have corrupted how scientific institutions work (note that
I don't say "science" here) and therefore many scientists work in
environments where they look for profitable solutions instead of gaining
general knowledge. But on the other hand, there are still many many
scientists fighting their way through the system.
I think it's you cannot generalize it that way. You see,
there are even scientists in Mongolia and I think you'll agree that it's
absolutely impossible they are working for the powers that be :)
In other words: I still have hope that not all is lost!
The problem is, that knowledge is neutral and ethics depends on the
people's current views. Nuclear fission works the same wether you look
at it from 1945 or 2017.
Yes, many scary things have been discovered and published so far. But if
all those scary things haven't been published when they were scary, we
might very well still use horse-drawn carriages for transportation.
Look at it from the security industry perspective: full disclosure of
vulnerabilities in software is way better than keeping this knowledge
secret. A few who know about it (the NSA) can abuse it to gain power
over other people, while nobody else is able to defend themselfes. So,
making vulnerabilities public might give the bad boys tools to attack
people, but it also gives everyone else the possiblity for defense.
I think it is the same with general science. Better everyone knows it
than just a few.
Indeed. But there are scientists who are fighting against this.
I will do that.

The point of science is to find answers to open questions and by doing
so gain knowledge. Seriously, science is not the enemy. It were not the
