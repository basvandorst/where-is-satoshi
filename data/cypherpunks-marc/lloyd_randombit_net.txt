Like it matters. Do you really think that the government would really allow
Intel and AMD to sell CPUs that didn't have tiny transmitters in them? Your CPU
is actually transmitting every instruction it executes to the satellites.

I wonder if my Model M keyboards (which have individual electrical/mechanical
switches under each key) are vulnerable to this attack. It is pretty noisy, I
can imagine that the noise of each key's switch is sufficiently different (due
to wear, etc) that it would still work with modifications.

So... don't give your account info to organized crime, and don't use Outlook,
and your risk is reduced by, what, 90%? And doing online banking from a Net
cafe... I mean really.
At least some of these numbers seem wrong. If "nearly 2 million" people got
ripped off last year, and "at least 1.8 million" people fell for phishing
attacks, then why would keyloggers/viruses cause "up to half" of the account
compromises? Did nearly a million people fall for phishing attacks and yet were
too stupid to even get their account details correct?

Anyone know what's up with this? I'm guessing this just means AES, or maybe

BATON or JUNIPER.

Well, nothing stopping you from treating your datagram-based VPN (ie, DTLS) as
an IP tunnel, and doing TCP-like stuff on top of it to handle the IM and file
transfer. Actually I'm working on something rather like that now, which may or
not get finished soon.

How well is VoIP going to work over SSL/TLS (ie, TCP) though? I've never used
any VoIP-over-TCP software before, but some people I know who have say it sucks
(terrible latency, sometimes as bad as 5-10 seconds). That may have just been
an artifact of a bad implementation, though. DTLS might be a better pick for
securing VoIP. There's also SRTP.

One would hope that they meant anonymizing the subjects, much the same way some

give everyone full search abilities.

@_subject: Re: hedging our bets -- in case SHA-256 turns out to be insecure 
If performance is really an issue one could code a combined H1/H2
function which would interleave the operations, which would prevent
needing two passes (which _is_ really important since memory and disk
latencies are usually the biggest factor in performance). Direct
interleaving would also offer better ILP.
But even updating both hashes at the same time would prevent needing
two full passes; something like the code below would offer much better
cache utilization, and would not be at all difficult to implement:
while data_left:
  block = input.read_one_block()
  h1.compress(block)
  h2.compress(block)
If it was really important, choosing a nonstandard H2 could offer even
better performance; for instance let H1=SHA-256 and H2=SHA-~256, where
SHA-~256 is precisely SHA-256 but with all of its constants bitwise
inverted. One could compute both functions in parallel using SIMD
(SSE2, ARM's NEON, etc) [and they could share the message expansion,
which is quite costly in SHA-2]. It's not clear from a quick read of
the paper Zooko referenced ("On the Strength of the Concatenated Hash
Combiner when All the Hash Functions are Weak") if this would actually
meet the requirements of "sufficiently different" for the results
there to apply, though.
One trouble with this construction that Zooko's does not have is that
it can fail even if H1 is collision resistant due to an inner
The GOST hash does use the sum of input blocks (as the final input to
the compression function) but it has a number of other components; it
is actually quite slow compared to modern hashes.

@_subject: Re: Intel to also add RNG 
I think it's important to make the distinction between trusting Intel
not to have made it actively malicious, and trusting them to have
gotten it perfectly correct in such a way that it cannot fail.
Fortunately, the second problem, that it is a well-intentioned but
perhaps slightly flawed RNG [*], could be easily alleviated by feeding
the output into a software CSPRNG (X9.31, a FIPS 186-3 design, take
your pick I guess). And the first could be solved by also feeding your
CSPRNG with anything that you would have fed it with in the absense of
the hardware RNG - in that case, you're at least no worse off than you
were before. (Unless your PRNG's security can be negatively affected
by non-random or maliciously chosen inputs, in which case you've got
larger problems).
[*] Even if it were perfectly designed, it seems plausible to me that
manufacturing defects and/or any number of runtime problems (age,
overheating, bad voltage control, cosmic rays, dirty power, etc, etc)
might cause subtle failures/biases that might be difficult to detect
reliably; I would personally be dubious of using any hardware RNGs
output directly for this reason.

Suite B is specified for 128 and 192 bit security levels, with the 192
bit level using ECC-384, SHA-384, and AES-256. So it seems like if
there is a hint to be drawn from the Suite B params, it's about
Not to mention that our entire PKI system (as well as TLS < 1.2, ie
the versions actually supported in browsers) rely on the security of
SHA-1, an algorithm which has a public 2**68 (IIRC) collision attack
and which was phased out by NIST years ago.
Fortunately now TLS 1.2 is finally being forced into most browsers
thanks to BEAST, Lucky13, RC4 breaks, etc but still we're bound to see
some major problems on the PKI side when a practical chosen prefix
SHA-1 collision is found, as I expect at least a few widely used CAs
have still not adopted randomized serial numbers and will have the MD5
experience all over again.
Worth noting that NIST has announced plans to create AEAD modes based
on Keccak. It will be interesting to see how quickly AES-GCM is phased
out of Suite B once that occurs.
