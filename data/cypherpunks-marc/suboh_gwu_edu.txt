This is the repeated message that I can see in the manager.log
^G/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost' failed
error: 'Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/usr/local/mysql/mysql-test/var/tmp/master.sock' (2)'
Check that mysqld is running and that the socket: '/usr/local/mysql/mysql-test/var/tmp/master.sock' exists!
