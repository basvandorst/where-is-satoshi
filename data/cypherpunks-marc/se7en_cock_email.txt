Only the truly retarded use such things, but the sad fact is that the

I previously was unable to send email to this list. My assumption was
my email provider was erroneously blocked as is often the case (due to
the humorus name). I attempted to contact the ML's admin to see if he
could whitelist me but there was no reply. Since I just was able to
reply, I am curious if this message will get through as well.

I expected Israel to do such a thing, however this is nothing new. A
2017 study found that nearly every single embassy in the Washington DC
Area had Stingray Devices with the assumed goal of spying on members
of Congress.

This is a test message. A user from this list emailed me to ask if our

Zoom is a proprietary Teleconfrencing Software package that has grown
in popularity over the past month. I had not heard of it until
recently. Many schools that are still open have made it a
requirement, from High School to College Level. It is a proprietary
piece of technology that need not be used, especially when
alternatives exist.
Previously, I shared a video from Luke Smith, an internet personality,
on Zoom. Now, the FSF has made a statement, as seen below.

Title: IBM, Amazon Agree to Step Back From Face Recognition. Where Is Microsoft?
Author: Matthew Guariglia

Activism is working. Both on the streets as people protest to end[1]
racist and violent policing, and among civil liberties organizations who
have been fighting[2] the governmentâs use of harmful face surveillance
technology. This week two major vendors of face surveillance technology
announced that in light of recent protests against police brutality and
racial injustice, they would be phasing out or pausing their sale of this
technology to police.
The fact that these two companies, IBM and Amazon, have admitted the harm
that this technology causes should be a red flag to lawmakers. The belief
that police and other government use of this technology can be responsibly
regulated is wrong. Congress, states, and cities should take this
momentary reprieve, during which police will not be able to acquire face
surveillance technology from two major companies, as an opportunity to ban
government use of the technology once and for all.
In a letter[3] from Arvind Krishna to Congress, the IBM CEO announced that
in the name of racial justice the company would end research, development,
and sale of any face recognition technology:
This is a big pivot. In March 2019, IBM was criticized by photographers[4]
after it released a new dataset of diverse images, scraped from social
media platform Flickr, in hopes of training face recognition programs to
be less flawed[5] when recognizing people of color. Now the company
recognizes that better training data is not an effective solution to the
many problems of this menacing technology.
Amazon in turn announced[6] a 1-year moratorium on police use of its face
surveillance technology, Rekognition. This company also cited recent
protests as the impetus of re-examining the harm this technology can do to
already over-policed communities. Unfortunately, Amazon still clings to
the discredited notion that police can safely deploy face surveillance
technology if only there are enough rules. âWeâve advocated,â the company
posted, âthat governments should put in place stronger regulations to
govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent
days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge. We hope this
one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement
appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.â
Amazonâs Rekognition program has been particularly flawed and harmful. In
2018, the ACLU ran[7] faces of sitting U.S. congress members through the
program. Twenty-eight members of congress were incorrectly identified as
people who had been arrested for committing crimes. That same year EFF
joined with ACLU and a coalition of civil liberties organizations to
demand [8]that Amazon stop powering government surveillance infrastructure
with its flawed and invasive Rekognition program.
While we welcome Amazonâs half-step, we urge the company to finish the
job. Like IBM, Amazon must permanently end its sale of this dangerous
technology to police departments.
Microsoft is another one of the largest vendors of police-used face
surveillance. It must now follow suit and end government use of its facial
recognition program. Microsoft has expressed concerns over harms police
use of face recognition can cause. In 2019, Microsoft stated[9] that it
had denied one California law enforcement agency use of its face
recognition technology on body-worn cameras and car cameras, due to human
rights concerns. The logical next step is clear: Microsoft should end the
program once and for all.
There should be a nation-wide ban on government use of face surveillance.
Even if the technology were highly regulated, its use by the government
would continue to exacerbate a policing crisis in this nation that
disproportionately harms Black Americans, immigrants, the unhoused, and
other vulnerable populations. We agree that the government should act, and
are glad that Amazon is giving them a year to do so, but the outcome must
be an end to government use of this technology.
The movement to ban face recognition is gaining momentum. The historic
demonstrations of the past two weeks show that the public will not sit
idly by while tech companies enable and profit off of a system of
surveillance and policing that hurts so many.
Face recognition isn't the only problematic tool tech companies offer to
police. Though Amazon has pressed pause on offering Rekognition to police,
Amazon-owned Ring, the "smart doorbell" and camera company, still partners
with over 1300 police departments[10]. These partnerships allow police to
make batch-requests for footage via email to every resident with a camera
within an area of interest to policeâpotentially giving police a one-step
process for requesting footage of protests to identify protestors. These
partnerships intensify suspicion, help police racially profile people, and
enable and perpetuate police harassment of Black Americans.
Join us in calling on Amazon to continue its thoughtful action in light of
nationwide activism, admit the dangers of Ring-police partnerships, and
immediately halt them.
TAKE ACTION[11]
TELL AMAZON RING: END POLICE PARTNERSHIPS
