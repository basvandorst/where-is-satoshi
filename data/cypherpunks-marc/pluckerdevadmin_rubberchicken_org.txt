@_subject: Your message to plucker-dev awaits moderator approval 
Your mail to 'plucker-dev' with the subject
    Hi
Is being held until the list moderator can review it for approval.
The reason it is being held:
    Post by non-member to a members-only list
Either the message will get posted to the list, or you will receive
notification of the moderator's decision.
