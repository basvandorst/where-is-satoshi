Hi, my name is Kandy!  ;-)
I was searching for people to chat with and you came up!
I looked up some info on you and thought I would contact you. I love meeting new people, I also love to talk. I just got my videocam working so you can see me to!
You don't even need your own videocam! This is not my screenname, but a friends. To contact me you need to go to my personal site  its the only way to contact me! Just Copy and Paste in your Broswer
 onkandy.com/kcam.html Best of love and regards, Kandy
