The new quad r7 driver from TaylorMade® offers a broader scope of performance possibilities than any TaylorMade® driver before it. The r7 quad is designed to help you to hit the ball higher or lower; it can help you to hit the ball straighter or work it to the right or left. Best, the r7 quad is engineered to promote longer drives than you've ever hit before. Your email address is cypherpunks
