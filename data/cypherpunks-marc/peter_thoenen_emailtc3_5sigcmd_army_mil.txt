@_subject: Current Operational Nodes? 
Cross posting on multiple nodes since none seem reliable.
Now that LNE is shutting down ... are there actually any other reliable
operational nodes?  Have subscribed to minder.net, algebra.com, and ds.pro-ns.net all in the last two weeks to no avail.  Some return subscribed message but never forward actual traffic (just spam).  Think I actually got one or two operational messages from algebra but thats it.
Do we want another node?  I can throw one up if wanted / needed /
trusted (being a contractor for 'the man' and all such bullshit jazz) or do we just want to let this list die?  Not a big fan of newsgroups.
If wanted, will host offsite on a non-gov commercial server.  Personal politics aside, its an enjoyable list to lurk on :)

Yes.  The Jews knew what was happening which is why the rich, smart, and
saved a few more lives, but prevented it, no.  Crypto won't hide your
ethnicity.  This is like arguing would widespread communications and
crypto in the US slave south have prevented black enslavement.  Sure the
underground railroad would have worked better, but your still black.
