SIXTH INTERNATIONAL DAY AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY

HELP ORGANISE INTERNATIONAL DAY AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY!
SIXTH INTERNATIONAL DAY AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY
MARCH 15th, 2002
March 15 2002 marks the sixth year of this international day of protest and solidarity against police brutality. It first began in 1997 as an initiative of the Black Flag collective in Switzerland along with the help of COBP (French acronym for Collective Opposed to Police Brutality) of Montreal. Since its first year, the International Day Against Police Brutality (IDAPB) has been a success. This date was chosen because on March 15th, two children, aged 11 and 12, were beaten by the Swiss police.
This day of denouncing police brutality is also an opportunity to create and strengthen ties between groups that work directly or indirectly against State brutality around the world. It permits the creation an indispensable international solidarity in the fight against police forces that collaborate world-wide and are extremely well organized. The IDAPB, which concretely represents this solidarity, should not be overlooked as an element in the development and need to denounce police brutality. The day shatters the myth of unanimity about the virtues of the police (positive values promoted especially by TV cop shows, Hollywood films and mass media). It also ends the isolation of groups and individuals who, engaged in this struggle, are subjected to daily repression.
The modern State's favoured instrument of repression, the police, is a fairly recent development in history: In the early 1800s, industrialisation is in full swing, people are migrating to the cities, becoming urban workers and swelling the proletarian class. Class conflicts increase when the bourgeoisie (urban ruling class) and industrial property (capital) live in close proximity to workers. With the increasing agitation and organisation of workers, the police is instituted to fight labour and protect industrial property.
Which "crime" shall be punished or not is left to the police's discretion; which laws shall be enforced, where and at what time, and especially who is forced to respect the law, is decided by the police. In effect, the police, the right arm of the State, abuses its power on a daily basis and exercises its violence with near total impunity. The police continuously and everywhere violate the very laws that they are supposed to uphold. The police check identity, spy, double-deal, hustle, repress, ticket, despise, pursue, arrest, imprison, deport, harass and beat-up; they inflict indignity, they torture and they kill. Their primary targets are the "undesirables of society," (the dangerous classes): the poor, the homeless, people of colour, immigrants and persons with irregular status ("illegal immigrants" and people who work under-the-table), sex workers, activists, the marginalised, student activists, organised workers, queer, gender-based and feminist activists and people who question and don't accept the legitimacy of the authorities.
As well, in the last few years, the world-wide movements and struggles against capitalist globalisation have been met with increasingly violent police repression. Police forces are no longer content in using 'less-than-lethal' weaponry against demonstrators. They are no longer just satisfied with perpetrating abominable acts of brutality, "preventive" arrests (kidnapping), illegal detentions, as well as inhuman jail conditions and torture. The police no longer hesitate to shoot at demonstrators, to kill them, be it in Gothenburg, in Genoa, in Argentina: we now need to count those wounded or killed by bullets. In response to the strength and breadth of anti-globalization demonstrations opposing the fortress of capitalism, the widening gap between the rich and the poor, the deepening of this poverty, the generalised misery and deterioration of living conditions, governments invest in their police forces, in order to maintain, at whatever cost, order and social peace.
The September 11 events in the USA have created genuine security craze the world over. Anti-terrorist laws, overtly fascist since they threaten the most fundamental rights, are being pushed through by governments world-wide. Increased and systematic surveillance of all means of communications, tougher border controls (if not their closure), racist and anti-immigration laws that far from effecting potential terrorists directly hit students, asylum seekers, refugees, persons waiting for normalisation documents, families waiting to be reunited, etc. These incidents have also resulted in the sudden increase in budgets and powers given to different police forces at the international level, which clearly signals totalitarian repercussions against all undesirables, 'the dangerous classes.'
Faced with the drift to state fascism, to the rhythm of the jackboot, we have the responsibility to act and support all victims of State force. We keenly invite you to participate in the International Day Against Police Brutality (IDAPB).
Until now, this event has taken place in several forms; street theatre, murals, publications, demonstrations, conferences, postering, workshops, exhibitions, radio and television shows, and cultural events. Some groups have organised more than one activity while others have formed coalitions. All collectives or individuals decide on what type of action, depending on the political climate of their country, the energy and willingness of people to organise an event, the resources available, etc. The key thing is the imagination and the creativity of the people involved.

@_subject: Anarchist Q+A 
ANARCHIST QUESTION AND ANSWER
Q. What would happen to the surplus produced by an anarchist community?
A. Currently surplus production to need is either stored or traded.  Some
countries rely on the production of surplus to purchase products they don¹t
produce.  Very few on anarchist communities would be self sufficient, those
that are would not have to worry about trading with surrounding communities.
Those that are not self-sufficient are faced with problems that could
threaten their very survival.  Even those that are currently self-sufficient
may find that through no fault of their own they could face scarcity in the
near future.
Anarchist trading is not based on the concept that if you give us a plane we
will give you two tractors.   It¹s based on the idea of satisfying human
need, initially basic human needs, later on non-essential human needs.
Surplus production would be shared by those communities that need that
surplus.  This wouldn¹t occur because of any altruistic reasons it would
occur for very good practical reasons.  The bigger the pool that shares
surpluses produced the greater the possibility that everybody¹s human needs
within that pool will be satisfied.
Each community producers and distributes with the expectation that one day
when they are faced with scarcity, other communities within the network they
belong to would assist them.  This principle is akin to the principle
followed by communities that currently live in harsh environments.  They are
willing to extend the hand of hospitality to a stranger, because they know
that one day they may find themselves in the same situation.  Mutual
obligation encapsulates the sentiments that regulates "trading" between
anarchist communities.  The interaction between an anarchist  and a
non-anarchist  community would be different to the way anarchist communities
interact, because the concept of mutual obligation may not exist between
these communities.  In these situations, communities trading relationships
would mirror the type of trading arrangement we are familiar with now.

"Good parents know revenge doesn't work with their children, good teachers know it doesn't work in the classroom, good citizens know it doesn't work in their community, and a growing proportion of the criminal justice world is embracing the vision of "restorative justice" as a much more functional grounding for most of their work. Even though the majority of people in the US know that revenge doesn't work, there is a lack of awareness of the power of nonviolence in the larger public arena, even though two thirds of the world's population has experienced nonviolent social change that was successful beyond anyone's wildest dreams in South Africa, Eastern Europe, the Philippines, Gandhi in India, the US civil rights movement, to name just a few case studies covered in this remarkable book."

@_subject: Intellibridge:Selling Enron short. 
Enron hired Intellibridge, based in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C., to serve as its independent propaganda arm by creating a news Web site and organizing conferences that would bring regulatory, political, media and business leaders together to discuss the merits of a more competitive energy market.
In compiling a story on alleged conflicts of interest, it would seem that the Post would have wanted to reveal that Rothkopf was founder and chief executive officer of a company that served as a consultant for Enron, instead of framing Rothkopfs comments as those from a somewhat disinterested third party who worked in the Clinton administration.
Immediately prior to forming Intellibridge, Rothkopf served for two years as managing director of Kissinger Associates, Inc., the geo-political consulting group chaired by the former U.S. secretary of state. After his stint at Kissinger Associates, Rothkopf founded Intellibridgeoriginally called the Newmarket Companywith the support of several former government officials, including former National Security Advisor Anthony Lake and former Central Intelligence Agency director John Deutch, who was accused in 2000 of mishandling sensitive data while serving at the CIA and previously as an under-secretary at the Defense Department.
As part of the contract with Enron, Intellibridge had the mandate to help stop the spread of the energy industrys equivalent of the rotten apple syndrome through a public image enhancement campaign. Enron wanted to make sure negative perceptions about the company did not spread to segments of the American public that would hear about the company only in terms of the California energy crisis.
After awarding the contract, Enron alerted Intellibridge about who its friends werecertain conservative economists, the Wall Street Journal editorial page and large industrial companiesand who its enemies wereNew York Times columnist Paul Krugman, then-New York Times editorial page editor Howell Raines, who late last summer moved into the top editorial position at the paper, and consumer advocacy groups.
Enron also wanted Intellibridge to create an advisory committee to help guide the public image campaign. Candidates for the committee included Cambridge Energy Research Associates Chairman Daniel Yergin, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, Economist magazine energy and environmental reporter Vijay Vaitheeswaran and Wall Street Journal columnist Rebecca Smith.
Intellibridge unveiled its news Web site for Enron at an Enron-sponsored conference early last October at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Arlington, Va. Attending the conference were business leaders, politicians and regulators from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, excluding former FERC Chairman Curt Hebert, who had left FERC in August 2001 after learning the Bush administration had consulted with Enron in choosing Pat Wood to take over as FERC chairman.
Soon after Intellibridge organized the conference in October, Enrons fortunes began to crumble and the company then had too much damage for Intellibridge to control, thus putting an end to the relationship.

A former United States Air Force sergeant has pleaded not guilty to trying to spy for Iraq, Libya and China.
Retired intelligence analyst Brian Regan, 39, is accused of writing to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and offering to provide him with secret information for $13m.
"We enter a plea of not guilty and request a trial by jury," his lawyer Nina Ginsberg told a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.
Mr Regan, who could face the death penalty if found guilty, was originally charged with attempted espionage last October.
Prosecutors say Mr Regan said in a letter to the Iraqi leader: "I am willing to commit esposinage (sic) against the United States by providing your country with highly classified information."
Because of the risks involved, Mr Regan allegedly said he wanted at least $13m - "a small price to pay for what you [Saddam] will receive".
Mr Regan worked for the National Reconnaissance Office, a military intelligence agency that builds and operates America's network of spy In the letter, Mr Regan allegedly said he had access to highly sensitive material from all the US intelligence services.
He is said to have told the Iraqi leader that he was planning to retire soon and needed the extra money because he would only receive a "small" government pension.
Mr Regan is also said to have offered to give Iraq a sample of classified documents for $1m.
He allegedly said the information he was offering was worth "billions" and urged the Iraqi leader not to pass up "the chance of a lifetime".
Mr Regan is also accused of drafting a similar letter to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.
Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson did not disclose whether the letter was actually delivered, but said the case against Mr Regan "paints a picture of betrayal".
Mr Regan was arrested in August last year at Dulles International Airport as he tried to board a flight to Germany.
Police allegedly found addresses for the Chinese and Iraqi embassies in Switzerland and Austria in his wallet and secreted in the sole of his shoe.

@_subject: No Justice,No Peace! 
WAILING WALLS
British headlines are full of suicide bombs, raids on Jewish settlements,
inter-Palestinian violence. My experience of the past few weeks has
included listening to Israeli F16 bombers flying low over Gaza City for two
consecutive nights. That is the real drama being played out in the grim day
to day existence of Palestinians. - Rev. Lucy Winkett (Human Rights
One day in 1998 Salim Shawamreh and his family were eating dinner at their
home in Anata, a Palestinian suburb of Jerusalem, when the house was
surrounded by two hundred Israeli soldiers. They were given just 15 minutes
to pack their bags before their house was destroyed.
Salim tried to stop the soldiers and was attacked then arrested; his wife
locked the doors, trying to keep their six children safe. The army
responded by breaking windows and throwing in tear gas. Salim's 'crime' was
that he didn't have a permit for his house. He owned the land that he had
bought to house his family, who were living in cramped conditions in a
refugee camp. But every time he applied for a building permit to build his
house legally, according to rigged Israeli law, he was refused.
What happened to Salim and his family is what Jeff Halper from the Israeli
Committee Against House Demolitions describes as the Kafka-esque
administration system designed to wear the Palestinians down...laws,
zoning, planning, permits, settlements, roadblocks all designed to
control and confine the Palestinians. In the past few years 250 by-pass
roads costing $3 billion dollars and all funded by the US have been built
to bypass Palestinian settlements - cutting the Palestinian state up into
small isolated islands. In the Jewish settlements there are bungalows and
swimming pools, and well-watered land, whereas in Palestinian Khan Younis a
population of 200,000 people doesn't even have a sewage system. For the
Israeli government this war of attrition is much more preferable than using
the army, because images of soldiers shooting at stone throwing youths does
not go down well internationally. Much better, and much less newsworthy to
drown the Palestinians in bureaucratic despair.
Currently over 180 Palestinian children are being held as political prisoners in Israeli
jails where they are subject to violence and denied basic rights such as family and lawyer
visits and the right to continue their education.
Peace House
During the demolition of Salim's house local villagers and people from the
Committee Against House Demolitions tried to stop it being destroyed -
seven were injured including a 16 year old who lost a kidney. The Red Cross
gave the family a tent where they lived by the ruins of their house, until
a new one was built with the help of hundreds of people. Just 24 hours
later however and the army were back with the bulldozers - this time even
taking the tent because it didn't have a permit! Yet again hundreds of
people helped to rebuild it, and again it was demolished, the army even
digging up the foundations.
The destruction is just one of the many hundreds in a fresh wave of house
demolitions that are taking place in Palestine. But Salim's house, dubbed
the Peace House, is also a symbol of the resistance that has taken place,
with Arabs and Jews working together to take direct action to stop the
demolitions and to rebuild those houses that have been destroyed. Support
from the Israeli people is important - they can get in front of bulldozers
and will only be arrested. If a Palestinians did the same they may be shot.
In other countries not quite so powerful as Israel, you would be hearing
words like ethnic cleansing and Apartheid (there are now Jewish-only
beaches) but then this is the fourth biggest military power in the world
receiving goodwill and good cash (£3 billion a year) from the most powerful
nation in the world - USA. As the Palestinian Authour, Edward Said
commented, "Israel's cruel confinement of 1.3 million people in the Gaza
Strip, jammed like so many sardines into a tiny place surrounded by a
barbed-wire fence, and of nearly two million in the West Bank - all of
whose entrances and exits are controlled by the Israeli Defence Force - has
few parallels in the annals of colonialism. Even under Apartheid, F16 jets
were never used to bomb African homelands, as they are now sent against
Palestinian towns and villages."
Last Orders
In the past few weeks nearly 230 Israeli army reservists, many of them
officers, have signed a petition saying they will refuse to serve in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip because Israel is "dominating, expelling,
starving and humiliating" the Palestinian population. The army revolt is
the biggest since the start of the 16-month Palestinian uprising. One of
them, Lieutenant Ishai Sagi, has described how, during one two-week stint
in the West Bank, he was ordered to open fire at Palestinians who picked up
stones for throwing at the troops. "Everything that we do in there - all
the horrors, all the tearing down of houses and trees, all the roadblocks,
everything - is just for one purpose, the settlers, who I believe are
illegally there. So I believe that the [orders] that I got were illegal and
I won't follow them again."
Last Saturday 10,000 people in Tel-Aviv, demonstrated their support for
those sentiments under the banner "The Occupation Is Killing Us All",
demanding an immediate end to the occupation of Palestinian land and
solidarity with the growing number of young Israelis who are refusing to

>>The primary moral justification for war is to protect the innocent from certain harm. Augustine, whose early 5th century book, The City of God, is a seminal contribution to just war thinking, argues (echoing Socrates) that it is better for the Christian as an individual to suffer harm rather than to commit it. But is the morally responsible person also required, or even permitted, to make for other innocent persons a commitment to non-self-defense? For Augustine, and for the broader just war tradition, the answer is no. If one has compelling evidence that innocent people who are in no position to protect themselves will be grievously harmed unless coercive force is used to stop an aggressor, then the moral principle of love of neighbor calls us to the use of force. <<

Richard's comments below are very much worth reading. Also check out the
following URLs for back fight-censorship messages about the RSA/Zimmermann
MIT's Seth Finkelstein on RSA/Zimmermann history:
   Background on RSA's involvement with recent crypto legislation:
         ---------- Forwarded message ----------
As an opponent of Clipper--I debated Dorothy Denning on NPR once--I
was glad to read about the new Japanese encryption chip.
But that chip is not the right solution for most people who want to
use encryption.  For example, I'm considering using digital
signatures.  I don't need the high power that requires special
expensive hardware, and I would rather not have to buy it.  What I
would really like is free software, which I can run on an ordinary PC,
to do the job.
Unfortunately, there isn't any.  RSA Inc. made sure of that.
Zimmermann initially intended to release PGP as free software.  But
RSA Inc threatened him with a patent suit, and forced him to change
the distribution terms.  Now PGP in the US uses RSAREF, which is
restricted by a patent license to non-commercial use only.  In other
words, only hobbyists and academics can use it.  There is a commercial
version which is proprietary software, and apparently not many people
want it badly enough to buy it.
The version of PGP used outside the US is free software, but if you
use it within the US, RSA Inc. can sue you.
This is very bad for people who would like to use PGP.  But it is
worse than that.  It affects the political battle too.
PGP had a chance to create a constituency of Americans who demand the
right to use encryption.  If PGP had been allowed for use in business,
not just by hobbyists, we would have far more Americans who care
enough to fight against Clipper--and they would include businesses
which have the funds to influence legislators.  RSA Inc. prevented
this from happening, and did so for no reason except money.
Bidzos and Rivest would like to present themselves as the defenders of
our freedom to use encryption.  And it is true, they would like us to
be able to use encryption, as long as we are required to pay them for
doing so.  But when they had the choice of letting us use encryption
freely or stamping it out, they chose the latter.
I hope you won't portray them as heroes.

The Lying Liar Who Always Lies.(A homage to jamesd)
I have written this about that lying liar Noam Chomsky to show that nothing Chomsky, that lying apologist for tyranny, mass murder, and brutal inequality of power says can be believed, because that lying liar is always lying, and to illustrate his methods of deceiving his readers.
When that lying liar Chomsky lies, he does not say plainly in so many words "X is true", instead he uses convoluted, indirect, and lawyer-like sentences that lead the reader to believe that X is true, and that Chomsky has presented a well documented case that X is true, whereas in fact that lying liar Chomsky, that lying apologist for tyranny, brutal inequality of power, and mass murder _has not actually said X at all_. That lying apologist for totalitarianism phrases things in such a way as to give the reader a false impression without actually stating the lie in so many words, so whenever one of his lies is exposed, that lying liar Chomsky's lying fans lie "Ah, but Chomsky did not actually say X". Even though any true-believing anarcho-capitalist who -- like me -- defends property rights by stealing from Herman and Chomsky, reading the work in dispute would get the impression, after just a few hours of mental squinting and having refused to take my thorazine for a couple weeks, that that lying liar Chomsky had somehow or other _meant_ to lie and say X even though he _didn't_ say X. And that lying liar Chomsky probably just does this to make me look like a fool or a lunatic when I post that he's lying by saying X, and his fans can then lie that he never said X and when I look again, I see that he _didn't_ actually say X but not-X. That lying bastard. Whether he said X or didn't say X, he damn well _meant_ X and was lying when he meant X whether he said X or not-X. That lying liar is always lying and he always lies. MORE ON

  Yes, I read it years ago. That book is fiction. Whether it represents any sort of potential reality is highly questionable. Even its premise is stilted: It hypothesizes a tiny, essentially homogenous society populated by immature boys, dropped into circumstances entirely foreign from anything they had ever known, with no adult guidance at all. Can you really expect good results from this, in fiction no less? Would it have made a good book if everything had happened hunky-dory? Anyway, anarchy is tradionally considered unstable because the strong are able to oppress the weak, and the weak can't effectively fight back, so governments are instituted. The system I've described, AP, allows a substantial number of anonymous weak people to (anonymously) pool their resources and defend themselves against a smaller number of strong oppressors. This is NEW. It may, in fact, allow anarchy to exist in a stable form, which may sound like an oxymoron but is not. If anarchy does indeed work, when suitably stabilized, then your premise is simply wrong.
 > Have any of you AP proponents >considered that perhaps our oh-so-corrupt government officials are simply >the best that our amoral, decaying populace has to offer? What would we >gain by rubbing them out?
  I see we have another Dr. Pangloss here. "the best of all possible worlds."
We have plenty to gain by removing them from their positions of power. They are wasteful parasites. They engage in make-work. They manipulate the rest of us. They criminalize activities that should not be crimes. They make us waste our resources, for example by keeping ever-larger numbers of people in jail and prison. They are protected by militaries, which are wasteful uses of our resources. Ultimately, they end up killing huge numbers of people, ultimately just to protect the supremacy of these government employees and officeholders.
 > Maybe the current form of government isn't perfect, or even great, but it is still >much better than anything that could possibly result from anonymous terrorism, >which is really what AP is, isn't it?
Who is to say that we even need a government? What, exactly, is the function of a government? Is that function truly necessary? Remember, AP changes the political landscape substantially. You can't any longer say things like "governmnet is necessary so that we can protect ourselves against foreign nations," because there will no longer be any foreign nations, or foreign armies, etc.
 >Peace can only be achieved by understanding, not through force or fear.
Sounds like a truism that isn't necessarily true. Don't deny individuals the right to defend themselves. If you do, then you actually encourage force used against them, and magnify their fear. Don't selectively apply this rule to ordinary citizens, while forgetting to apply it to officials. And maybe we don't really even need to "achieve peace." I've come to the conclusion that the only reason war is "necessary" is to protect the leadership of a country, not to protect its citizens. Remove that leadership from power, and peace will be automatic. Jim Bell jimbell

My point is actually not so much one of claiming credit for something I've
been involved with since 1988, as being somewhat critical of the
all-too-common tendency I see of _renaming_ something without adding any
new content.
Jim Bell calls his set of ideas "cyber-anarchy," and certain journalists
have picked up on this (as with the Australian article).
But with the exception of the one variant of anonymous markets, namely,
"assassination politics," most or all of the other ideas of his
"cyber-anarchy" seem to be encompassed by the already-existing term.

You can skirt the issue by saying, in your "literal reading" mode, that you have not called for any such thing.

@_subject: Death Pen 
YORK: Racial bias, incompetent law enforcement and political pressure on judges are key factors behind a "serious" error rate in the US's death penalty system, according to a new study.
"Heavy and indiscriminate use" of capital punishment in some states, such as Texas and Florida, magnifies the problem and increases the risk of innocent people being sentenced to death.
"The time has come to fix the death penalty or end it," concludes the study, A Broken System by researchers at New York's Columbia University. "There is growing awareness that serious, reversible error permeates the system, putting innocent lives at risk, heightening the suffering of victims, leaving killers at large, wasting tax dollars and failing citizens and the justice system."
The study is the second part of a landmark examination of US death penalty cases from 1973 to 1995. The first instalment, released in June 2000, found courts reversed 68 per cent of death verdicts.
The report claims the incompetence of defence lawyers, misconduct of police and prosecutors and bias of jurors and judges accounted for 76 per cent of the reversals.
In 82 per cent of cases, the defendant did not receive the death sentence at retrial, including 9 per cent who were exonerated. Since 1975, 99 inmates have been freed from death row.
The study finds high reversal rates in areas where the homicide risk for whites is higher than for blacks and in jurisdictions where local authorities have poor crime-fighting records. Further, "the more often and directly state trial judges are subject to popular election, and the more partisan those elections are, the higher the state's rate of error".
The study also finds significant discrepancies within states. In Lexington County, South Carolina, the death sentence was imposed 93 times per 1000 homicides. In Richland County, a few kilometres away, the rate was 9 per 1000.
"The capital system is collapsing under the weight of error and the risk of executing the innocent is high," research leader James Liebman said.
Professor Liebman opposes capital punishment and critics charge the study is skewed to reflect his views. They say the fact errors are detected and sentences reversed shows the system is not "broken".

@_subject: Anarchist's that vote. 
Vote No in government's anti-choice referendum As we face into campaigning against yet another abortion referendum we are taking this opportunity to detail why we this is such an important issue for us. Anarchism is all about the freedom to choose to make decisions that directly effect us. For women, this includes the decision whether or not to become pregnant, whether or not to remain pregnant, whether or not to have children. It is possible to be an anarchist and to have a moral objection to abortion. It is not possible to be an anarchist and not support the right to choose. For if the right to choose does not rest solely with pregnant women, where does it lie; with the state, with lawyers and the courts, with police? The logic of the anti-choice position is that women are coerced into continuing with unwanted pregnancies. To anarchists this is unacceptable. Women consider many different issues when they make the decision to have an abortion. They consider the views of their partner, parents and of the society they live in. They consider the effect it will have on their career or studies. They think about whether they are ready for motherhood. They look at the relationship they are in. They examine their financial situation. The decision is complex and not an easy one. The best person, indeed the only person, with the right to make that decision, is the woman who is going to have to live with its consequences. So for us, the right to abortion is a basic human right. For many women abortion isn't a choice, rather it is the only option in their circumstances. The right to choose should also include the right to choose to become a mother. While we fight for abortion rights  on one hand, we also fight for the removal of stigma and economic barriers, which prevent some women from carrying through a pregnancy, which they would like to continue with. Our fight for abortion rights therefore is also part of a wider struggle to re-define what sort of lives women  are able to lead. It is just as much part of a struggle for a society that supports parents in their decision to have children. In defending and defining the right to choose in the broadest way possible, we are defending the right to make choices about how to live our lives. In doing this we are setting the agenda for a future society. Aileen O'Carroll

It could ask for anonymous contributions from the public, and individuals would be able to send those contributions using digital cash." He explains that "using modern methods of public-key encryption and anonymous digital cash, it would be possible to make such awards in such a way so that nobody knows who is getting awarded the money, only that the award is being given. Even the organization itself would have no information that could help the authorities find the person responsible for the prediction, let alone the one who caused the death." Kill the president,pr.

Defense analysts say that most of this has nothing to do with streamlining the military for the light, super-mobile special ops needed to fight terrorists. But who cares? There's money to be made. Predictably, the Big Five are all doing well on Wall Street (except, oddly, Boeing, the only loser in the fund, down 5.9 percent since 9-11).
But the real highfliers in the Axis of Evil are the security and biometrics companies that will help homeland defenders track your every move and keep out the jihadis. Viisage Technology, which makes digital ID systems, is up 317 percent; Visionics, which helps law enforcement manage fingerprint and voice and face recognition databases, is up 182 percent; Invision Technologies, which makes explosives-detection systems (useful at luggage check-ins), is up a rip-roaring 1,299 percent.
Then there are bioterror detection experts like Cepheid and bullet manufacturers like Alliant Techsystems, both looking very healthy. Point is: Run down the line of companies that cater to a climate of impending doom, you'll find rising returns in every one.
I called up Amy Domini, who manages Domini Social Equity for investors with a "conscience," to brag about how well the Axis of Evil is doing. Social funds like Domini make a point of shutting out tobacco, alcohol, gambling, big oil, defense, small arms, and agribusiness stocks -- wherever profit seems to come before people, the social funds say no. As for the Axis: "Well," says Domini with a sigh, "I've never come across such a fund. If it did exist, the manager would have to be the most cynical human being ever born. But this is definitely his time -- the heyday for such a thing. There's a man in the White House who appears to be absolutely obsessed with But if there's a war on, isn't it in fact far from cynical to invest in the big-budget defenders of the nation? I mean, get with the program, Domini! Come in for the Big Push. Come to think of it, it's the socially "responsible" funds that are un-American: They won't invest in oil or pistols or even Jack Daniels. Probably dangerous; definitely to be monitored. More importantly, look at their lousy returns. Since 9-11, Domini Social rose just .84 percent, beating out the Dow, sure, by a hundredth of a percentage point -- squat compared to the Axis' 185 percent. Other socials climbed in the 1 to 2 percent range. The Pax World Balanced Fund was down 1.1 percent. Pax just doesn't pay.
  praise Bush and pass the ammunition. Our fund is looking even better than when Turchansky ran the numbers back in October: The Axis of Evil returned 185 percent for the period from Sept. 10 to the close on Feb. 5. For the same period, the S&P 500 climbed a piddling .32 percent, the Dow Jones Industrial a mere .83 percent.
Center stage in the fund, of course, are the Big Five defense contractors. Boeing is set to make billions on deals for its lethally dysfunctional V-22 Osprey helicopter-turboprop and its generously over-budget F-22 Raptor fighter jet. Raytheon makes the $750,000 Tomahawk missile, a favorite weapon of the military and used by the scores in Sudan, Iraq and now Afghanistan (the Navy, apparently, is running out of them). Lockheed Martin just sealed a $200 billion development contract for something called the Joint Strike Fighter. Northrop Grumman describes itself as "well-positioned in missile defense," meaning that it stands to win on the $9.2 billion Bush hopes to spend on the newly formed Missile Defense Agency (funding is expected to rise to over $11 billion annually by 2007). And shipbuilder General Dynamics is looking at some $7 billion in contracts for destroyers and attack submarines and aircraft carriers and lots of other costly toys.

"Historically, it has been essentially impossible to adequately motivate an assassin, ensuring his safety and anonymity as well, if only because it has been impossible to PAY him in a form that nobody can trace, and to ensure the silence of all potential witnesses. Even if a person was willing to die in the act, he would want to know that the people he chooses would get the reward, but if they themselves were identified they'd be targets of revenge. All that's changed with the advent of public-key encryption and digital cash. Now, it should be possible to announce a standing offer to all comers that a large sum of digital cash will be sent to him in an untraceable fashion should he meet certain "conditions," conditions which don't even have to include proving (or, for that matter, even claiming) that he was somehow responsible for a death."Saint Jim of Lompoc.

New KaZaA downloads upgrade
Kate Mackenzie
FEBRUARY 12, 2002
THE Australian company that bought popular file-sharing software KaZaA has launched the first new version of the program since it made the purchase.
Sharman Networks made the announcement via a Californian company today.
It said KaZaA 1.5 allowed users to recommend media files to other users, had a faster search function and loaded quicker than earlier versions.
Sharman Networks bought KaZaA from Dutch company Consumer Empowerment DV, which developed the FastTrack technology used in other file sharing programs Morpheus and Grokster. Consumer Empowerment and two US companies, which own Morpheus and Grokster, became the subject of a legal claim by the Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Association last October.
Although little information about Sharman Networks has been made available, its chief executive Nikki Hemming also headed the failed Sega World theme park in Sydney's Darling Harbour.
"The demand for the KaZaA Media Desktop continues to exceed our expectations with close to 1.5 million downloads a week," Ms Hemming said in the statement.

Chinese torture allegations
 From The Times
February 12, 2002
A SENIOR official in China's National Security Ministry has smuggled documents to the West that disclose orders to police chiefs to torture women members of Christian churches as part of a crackdown on religious groups.
Jubilee Campaign, a British human rights group, has obtained evidence of the women being abused with electric cattle prods, sexually assaulted and beaten into falsely confessing they were raped by their religious pastors.
Death sentences have been passed on several leading Christians in recent months, including a woman who is a member of the South China Church tried in secret in December.
The official who leaked the documents is in hiding, fearing for his life. The dossier has been passed to the White House before US President George W. Bush's visit to China this month.
Mr Bush has asked to be briefed about the treatment of Christian groups, and human rights groups hope this evidence will persuade him to take tougher action against Beijing. The testimony of these victims, smuggled out of prison at the end of last year, will embarrass Chinese officials who claim they have stopped such brutal tactics after being included in the World Trade Organisation and securing the Olympic Games for Beijing.
One woman prisoner, Yang Tongi, signed her testimony with a bloody fingerprint. She says she was seized from a bus and forced to kneel for hours in a prison cell before her interrogation began. She was handcuffed and her captors boasted as they beat her: "We can kill you without causing any problems."
She described watching a friend so badly beaten that her fingers were bent out of position and she could not straighten her legs.
Zhang Hongjuan, 20, said guards at the Zhong Xiang detention centre shackled her hand and foot and tortured her with an electric prod. "They forcefully unbuttoned my shirt and touched every spot on my chest with the electric club. I yelled at the top of my voice but they moved the club into my mouth to stop me from crying."
Others were forced to endure medical examinations as police sought proof they had had sex with their pastor. Tongjin Li said in the same jail she was threatened with sexual assault and a guard jeered: "This is not considered as raping but just coping with people like you."
The woman, who is scarred for life, said the attack on her continued for more than 15 hours and stopped only when she revealed a telephone number of a fellow Christian.
The Jubilee Campaign has shown The Times some of the original leaked documents from the Ministry of Public Security. They order a ban on a variety of "cults" which they consider a "crawling danger to domestic security and defence". They identify "cults" as any group which has refused to register with the Government and include Catholic and Protestant missions.
The documents include a speech by Sun Jianxian, a leading security official, telling his officers to intensify the crackdown which they must keep hidden from "hostile Western powers hastening to continue their strategies of 'westernising' our country". About 129 people have been killed for their religious activities and another 208 crippled by torture.

TELSTRA internet users could face further international traffic delays while a cable linking Australia and Western Europe is repaired.
Telstra spokeswoman Kerrina Lawrence said it was suspected the SEA-ME-WE3 cable had been damaged by sandmining at a point about 50km south of Singapore.
The SEA-ME-WE3 Consortium had dispatched a ship but was waiting for permission to enter Indonesian territorial waters before repairs could commence. This was expected tomorrow at the earliest.
Ms Lawrence said ADSL and cable customers had reported slow access at the weekend, but the impact had been "minimal" because traffic was re-routed to two other cables.
The cable has been cut several times before, causing widespread internet problems each time. Last year China Telecom sued a Chinese shipping company for the cost of the repairs.
Ms Lawrence said this incident was not as bad.
"There are thousands of kilometres of cable snaking under the sea along the seabed," she said.
"The last one was a straight cut, this is suspected damage that might have affected voltage. It doesn't seem to be as severe."
The repair costs, which would be borne by the consortium, could run to hundreds of thousands of dollars a day.
The cable, which connects Australia, South East Asia, the Middle East and Europe, has 40 landing points in 34 countries.

Revealed: our role in 'evil' spy game	
By BRENDAN NICHOLSON
Sunday 10 February 2002
Australia is helping Japan set up a network of spy satellites to monitor North Korea's ballistic missile system and to spy on military activity in China and far-eastern Russia.
In a significant development of the security relationship between Australia and Japan, a temporary ground station is being built in Western Australia to help get the four satellites into position.
The move preceded United States President George W. Bush's resolve to target North Korea as part of an "axis of evil". Australia's relatively muted approach to the project may be explained by the government's confirmation to The Sunday Age yesterday that North Korea will open an embassy in Canberra this year and Australia will open an embassy in Pyongyang next year.
A spokesman said Australia's decision to rebuild its formal relations with North Korea reflected Canberra's policy of maintaining dialogue as widely as possible.
A spokesman for Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Australia shared US concern that North Korea was a threat to regional stability in its own right and because of its willingness to sell missile technology to third On October 16, when Australians were focused on the federal election campaign, Mr Downer quietly announced that two satellite ground stations would be built at Telstra's Perth International Telecommunications Centre under a contract between Japan's National Space Development Agency and a Telstra joint venture company, Xantic.
A media release from the minister's office said one ground station would support two Japanese satellites carrying out scientific, research and commercial functions.
The other would be a temporary station set up to help get four "information gathering" satellites safely into space and to position them accurately in Once the satellites were in place the second ground station would be The media release did not mention that the four satellites would comprise a spy network for the Japanese Defence Agency.
Defence analyst Des Ball, of the Australian National University's Defence and Strategic Studies Centre, said the development was significant and essentially a positive one for Australia.
"Given that Japan in the past has been so reluctant to get in touch with anyone other than the Americans, they've never got into bed with anyone in any shape or form, so in a sense this is a first.
"I think it's essentially unobjectionable. It's not as if they're putting a major base or facility here, but people will raise questions about it, I'm Dr Ball said the satellites would carry out passive monitoring.
"There are many developments of real strategic concern to Japan in their region - everything from what's going on in China with the build-up of Chinese armed forces, nuclear programs, missile programs, the whole Korean That material was also of considerable interest to Australia.
By 1994, mounting tension in the region had created pressure for Japan to set up its own defence surveillance system.
The debate simmered until August, 1998, when Tokyo was horrified to discover from the US that North Korea had recklessly fired its new Taepodong missile over Japan and into the Pacific.
A stage of the missile landed in the Sea of Japan. It was not known whether the missile was on course but it certainly had the range to hit Japan.
Its government decided to put up a network of military surveillance satellites, which a 1999 Japanese Defence Agency white paper said would cost about $A2.5 billion.
The white paper said the satellites' instruments would be potent enough to identify ballistic missile sites through cloud or in darkness and to differentiate between military and civil ships and aircraft.
The North Koreans responded by claiming that Japan was preparing to invade Korea in cahoots with the US and warned Japan would suffer "an annihilating retaliatory blow" if it carried out a preemptive strike.
According to a paper prepared by Motohiro Tsuchiya, a senior research fellow at the International University of Japan's Centre for Global Communications, the defence agency's plans breached Japan's commitment to use space for only peaceful purposes. But the government concluded that the satellites would serve a purely defensive role.
Since the 1970s, China has had its own network of spy satellites keeping an eye on the region.
Its satellites orbit over Australia and could monitor activity here.
The first of the Japanese satellites is expected to be launched early in 2003 from Japan's Tanegashima Space Centre.
The network will be controlled and operated from Japan. Two will use a sophisticated form of very short wavelength radar to record images through cloud and the others will take optical pictures.
Dr Ball said he doubted that any operational material would be received directly by Australian stations.
"The quid pro quo is more likely to be that `we do a favour for you now and you do a favour for us at some time in the future'.
"We're not really in the business of detailed analysis of imagery from North-East Asia, which is where the Japanese stuff will relate to."
Material of interest to Australia would come via the CIA, thanks to Japan's close relationship with the US.
The Japanese network will complement a 50-year-old intelligence-sharing network involving the US and close allies including Australia.
The Japanese are considered third parties to the arrangement, along with South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and possibly Singapore.
The US is the first party, the second are Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
Dr Ball said Australia was responsible for monitoring South-East Asia and the US provided raw material for analysis, which Australia processed on behalf of its allies.
They would then pass on to the Japanese anything that was thought to be particularly relevant to them. "In so far as that leads to greater knowledge through these intelligence networks, anything that's important will get back to us," Dr Ball said.
He said the network would enable the Japanese to look at the same things they were now listening to. Japan had about 50 aircraft on continuous listening patrols over an area ranging from the Sea of Okhotsk down to Taiwan. That was one of the most intensively monitored areas in the world, he said.
Japan now had the second most powerful conventional military force on the planet, backed up by an increasingly potent intelligence service: "They're listening and watching - they're worried."
Japan had more than 100 standard P3-Orion maritime patrol planes in the region, backed by highly sophisticated EP-3 Orions capable of soaking up vast amounts of electronic information. The aircraft covered a radius of 1000 nautical miles.
Australia monitored a vast area from the mid-Indian Ocean across to the western Pacific.
"They will be monitoring, as they do with their airborne systems, everything north of Taipei and we will be monitoring everything south of However, Japan had obtained air-to-air refuelling planes and small aircraft carriers to increase the operational range of its forces. Its aircraft had been fitted with long-range missiles. He said Australia's defence cooperation with Japan began in the 1980s with links between the Australian Security Intelligence Service and the Cabinet Office in Tokyo.

Hi, here is info about 2 old Finnish anarchist actions, about which I only heard when I visited Finland this week... I leave it up to Ilan to decide if these are still interesting for a-infos subsrcibers. While Putin was in Finland in the beginning of the September, some 6 anarchists and anti-militarists decided to organise a night-demo ("Since his coinscience does not disturb his sleep, we will"). Demonstrators came to his hotel around one AM, and they were arrested almost immediately after blowing whistlerhorns. Police let them go next morning, with some minor misdemeanor charges. Action did not resulted to any media attention, unlike anti-Clinton night demo spring 1997 which was a big scandal. There were many actions in Helsinki during WTO action day 9th of November along with the main demo with turnout of 500, some of them had little connection with the general theme. More anarchist one was for "reclaiming the public space", when some 40 anarchists and other activists occupied space in Metro area with sofa and armchair, and had good time with some food and beer. Guards did not interrupted. This area is basically municipal and has much small business, but is terrorized by private guards of Danish security multinational Falck who violently attack homeless, punks and anyone who does not fit their criteria about who should be let to public spaces of today. Helsinki anarchists are organising campaign against Falck guards, if there are some stories about this company from other countries they might be interested. Antti R.

Belgium faces up to its bloody past
Forty one years after the event, Belgium has finally apologised for its role in the murder of Patrice Lumumba, an icon of the Left and Africa's most promising post-colonial leader, writes Andrew Osborn
Friday February 8, 2002
He was shot by firing squad, dismembered and then dissolved in a vat of sulphuric acid, but the spirit of Patrice Lumumba could not be extinguished.
This week, forty one years later, Belgium, the former colonial power in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (later to be renamed Zaire, and then after the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, the Democratic Republic of the Congo), apologised for its role in a political execution which ushered in 36 years of dictatorship under the tyrannical leadership of Mobutu Sese Seko.
Belgium may not have physically pulled the trigger, but it stood by and watched as others did, failed to protect Lumumba even though it knew he was in mortal danger, lent its military expertise and personnel to those who would murder him and then did its best to cover up what had happened.
That much has been established by a Belgian parliamentary inquiry which, after two years, has just wound up its work. No "smoking gun" was found but the panel did ascertain that Belgium bore "moral responsibility" for Lumumba's death.
This week's apology, proffered by Belgium's foreign minister Louis Michel, was cathartic and long-overdue.
It was January 17, 1961, when Lumumba, a former postal worker turned prime minister, met his end just a year after the Belgian Congo had been granted its independence after eighty years of rule from Brussels.
The country seemed to be on the cusp of a new, more enlightened era and hopes were high that Lumumba, charismatic and fiercely nationalistic, would be the man to turn the page. He was after all the country's first democratically-elected leader. But, bespectacled and defiant, Lumumba had too many enemies.
The first signs of trouble came in 1960, the year Belgium gave its largest colony (the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the size of western Europe) its independence. King Baudouin's handing-over speech rankled many. It was paternalistic and spoke in glowing terms of his country's contribution to the Congo. Lumumba was not scheduled to speak, but did so anyway. The force and frankness of his speech angered the Belgians, and was later described as "the detonator" for what was to follow.
"We have known sarcasm and insults, endured blows morning, noon and night because we were 'niggers,'" he declared in a speech which drew thunderous applause from the Africans and silence from the Belgians.
Lumumba was quickly branded a dangerous radical and a Communist sympathiser by the Belgians, and by the Americans who, it was later shown, also plotted to kill him.
In July 1960, serious trouble broke out in the Congo when Katanga, a copper and diamond-rich province, declared its independence with the full backing of Belgium. Lumumba called in UN peacekeepers but they did little more than maintain the status quo and in August of that year another part of the country declared its independence.
In September, the head of the armed forces, Mobutu Sese Seko, saw his chance, staged a military coup and deposed Lumumba who was arrested soon afterwards. Mobutu renamed the country Zaire and remained a faithful friend of the west living the high life until his own overthrow in May 1997.
Lumumba was less fortunate. He was transferred to Katanga on a Belgian plane on the orders of the Belgian foreign minister and assaulted and tortured in the presence of Belgian officers in a villa guarded by Belgian troops. However, no proof exists that his murder was ordered by Brussels.
He is then said to have been shot, along with two companions, by an execution squad supervised by a Belgian captain. Another Belgian, Gerard Soete, claims that he and others later chopped Lumumba's corpse into small pieces and dissolved it in acid. Soete, a former police commissioner, claims also to have kept two of Lumumba's teeth as "keepsakes" but to have later thrown them into the North Sea.
Lumumba's murder was, in short, one of the darkest episodes in Belgium's already blood-spattered colonial history.
"One day, history will have its say, but it will not be the history they teach at the UN, in Washington, Paris or Brussels but the history they teach in countries freed from colonialism and its puppets. Africa will write its own history and it will be one of glory and dignity."
With Belgian money, a Patrice Lumumba Foundation will be set up to fund conflict prevention projects in a country still riven by war. It may not seem like much, but along with Belgium's dignified apology it may help to create the fair and equitable Africa of which Lumumba dreamed so dangerously.

Hot dot missing at Lucas Heights

It's no bigger than a match head, and experts insist it is harmless, but the radioactive device that vanished from a building on the site of the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor has triggered a bureaucratic meltdown.
On January 10, workers at the Australian Radiopharmaceuticals and Industrials (ARI) building realised that the tiny piece of radioactive americium-241 was missing.
A search was immediately launched but a month later there is still no trace of the device, which is used by industry to measure the thickness of extremely fine materials, such as sticky tape.

Imagine for a moment that as ordinary citizens were watching the evening news, they see an act by a government employee or officeholder that they feel violates their rights, abuses the public's trust, or misuses the powers that they feel should be limited. A person whose actions are so abusive or improper that the citizenry shouldn't have to tolerate it. What if they could go to their computers, type in the miscreant's name, and select a dollar amount: The amount they, themselves, would be willing to pay to anyone who "predicts" that officeholder's death. That donation would be sent, encrypted and anonymously, to a central registry organization, and be totaled, with the total amount available within seconds to any interested individual. If only 0.1% of the population, or one person in a thousand, was willing to pay $1 to see some government slimeball dead, that would be, in effect, a $250,000 bounty on his head.

It could ask for anonymous contributions from the public, and individuals would be able to send those contributions using digital cash." He explains that "using modern methods of public-key encryption and anonymous digital cash, it would be possible to make such awards in such a way so that nobody knows who is getting awarded the money, only that the award is being given.

PRESS RELEASE For immediate release
CITY PAYS ACTIVISTS $469K IN "PUNISHMENT OF DISSENT" LAWSUIT Days after detaining WEF protesters & journalists, City pays for violating first New York City  City lawyers today agreed to pay approximately $469,000 in damages and legal costs to activists arrested in a 1999 Diallo-related protest. The twelve activists were jailed for over 24 hours  a common experience for dissenters under the Giuliani administration  instead of receiving summonses in accordance with NYPD practice for non-political The lawsuit alleged that the City targeted political protesters for punishment by imposing pre-trial jail time for charges that carry no jail sentence. Social justice organizers believe that as many as 800 such detentions of protesters may have occurred between 1999 and 2001, and that each instance was illegal and violated First Amendment rights.
The City blatantly targeted demonstrators who criticized Giuliani or the NYPD, said Mary Elizebeth Bartholomew, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and an attorney in the Brehon Law Society. On that day, we stood as Irish-Americans protesting racism in the NYPD, drawing parallels between policing in New York City and brutal, racist policing in the North of Ireland which targets Irish Catholics. Today we stand with the multitudes of poor people, youth, people of color, people with AIDS, queers and immigrants who were targeted for silencing by the Giuliani administration.
When we started hearing about protesters being jailed overnight in 1998, it added to a laundry list of Giuliani anti-speech practices which included slapping protesters with excessive charges, halting demonstrations in mid-stream, and arresting organizers in the middle of a protest to create chaos, said Emmaia Gelman, a plaintiff and a member of Irish Queers. Overnight detention was a weapon in a very obvious war on dissent.
The written order to jail protesters was uncovered last May by the New York Civil Liberties Union in a separate lawsuit. Previously, it was apparently hidden even from City lawyers. Rather than defend the policy, the City rescinded it in July 2001.
In today's settlement, the City agreed never to reinstate the policy. However, the settlement comes just days after the NYPD similarly detained demonstrators and independent journalists arrested at the World Economic Forum, leaving questions about a continuation of the illegal NYPD practice.

On December 1 2001, two anarchists were taken by the police in Usak (a city in Mid-West Anatolia, Turkey) with the claim of distributing illegal leaflets in a meeting organized by trade-unions. Later on, three other were taken, and all five of them were arrested with the claim of being members of an illegal terrorist organization namely Usak Anarchist Autonom. Although they did nothing more than distributing their own materials/leaflets, for this terrorist state it was enough to judge them with the claim of organizing in such a way to destroy or to divide it. They did not even find any (in their own words) violent or terrorist clues related with the group. The trail will be held in Izmir DGM (SSC-State Security Court) on 13 Feb. At the moment they are in Usak Prison; each of them in separate cells. This week theyll be sent to Izmir F-type prison. They were beaten badly and tortured by Usak police and refused the lawyers offered by the state.

@_subject: Striking the buggers out. 
Huge strikes and demonstrations have taken place in Italy. The spark for this wave of militancy has been the Prime Ministers attempts to steamroller through changes to the law which would reduce pensions and make workers easier to sack. A phenomenal 600,000 workers have taken to the streets - including 60,000 in Milan and 50,000 in Bologna. Workers in the following sectors have been ut on strike - tram, bus, metro workers, national railway, ferry, port and airline. Berlusconis last government in 1994 - which was also totally anti-working class, and also included neo-fascists - was mortally wounded by similar strikes. Some people never learn! In Germany the traditionally militant metalworkers are gearing up for a fight with the government France has seen demonstrations and strikes by Doctors, Nurses and other sectors of the heath service.
SOUTH AMERICA
THE resurgence of anarchism in South America has scared various governments into taking extreme measures against our comrades there. In Mexico the government is attempting to crush all genuine resistance. In the last few months, the Ricardo Flores Magon Native Peoples Council (CIPO-RFM) has been a regular target of the police. CIPO-RFM is rooted in the communities of Oaxaca State, since 1997 regrouping 4 Indian organisations of 2,000 people. It is openly anarchist and fights on several fronts, for better conditions (water, electricity, infrastructure, services) and for self-organisation of the communities. After having survived murder attempts, and continuing death threats, its activists are now subject to arbitrary arrests. This was particularly the case in the weeks before a big mobilisation in Oaxaca, on 18-20 November last, when all the CIPO communities were meeting on the question of native rights. One of the organisers, Raul Gatica, and his son Inti, were arrested and jailed for several days. International solidarity is essential. CIPO puts out a bulletin on the internet Nuu nkantaa which you can contact at ciporfm In Cali, Colombia, workers won a very significant victory by occupying an important communications tower for five weeks  all of their demands were met including the end of privatisation, and an investigation into management corruption.

@_subject: Finnish comrade dead at an early age. 
OBITUARY - Mika Talvilahti Mika Talvilahti 4th March 1974  28th December 2001 It is with great sadness that I write of the passing of London-based anarchist Mika Talvilahti, at the tragically young age of 27. He was born in the town of Saarijaervi, in the rural Jyvaeskylae region of Finland. Like many young Finns, he was radicalised by the states presumption that he was its property, and that as such he should serve in its army. Mika rebelled against the call to military service, throwing his lot in with the objectors. His life would never be the same. The Finnish state has taken advantage of the countrys close proximity to the old USSR to generate a culture of contempt for those young men who refuse to do their duty and defend their country. When you refuse military service in Finland, you are not just defying the state, but also public opinion. Mika fought both, his brave and defiant spirit moving him to involve himself more deeply in radical politics, adding anti-fascist work to his activities. At the age of 22, with work in short supply (particularly so for objectors), he packed up and made his way from Saarijaervi to London. A deep thinker, on his arrival he spent a long time mulling over his political experiences to date. Despite the social censure he had experienced in Finland, figured that if a self-educated man like himself could become an anarchist, anyone could! He decided he should move beyond activities emphasising a particular single issue, and work instead to spread revolutionary anarchist ideas and action in general. He involved himself in the activities of the London group of the Anarchist Federation, and helped set up the Walthamstow Anarchist Group, into which he put a tremendous amount of time and energy. Though he died young, Mika filled his life with more meaning than many who live to 90, but who never question what they are taught, never question the status quo, never strive for freedom. He confronted the authority of the state head on, and came out on the other side still fighting. It is this kind of life, a life full of love for liberty and strength of will, that gives so much hope for the future. On Sat 9 Feb, two events will be held for Mika. In the afternoon, his comrades will plant a tree dedicated to him in Walthamstow. From 8pm, there will be a gathering at Conway Hall. All are welcome. Tel: 07810 288 889 for more info.

@_subject: The States Are The Real Terrorists 
SUPPORT REVOLUTIONARY PRISONER THOMAS TRIPP!
On January 28, 2001, seven others and myself took part in a direct action protest of the lack of educational opportunities, the religious restrictions placed on Native Americans, the harsh, isolated conditions, and disrespectful, abusive guards at Two Rivers Prison in Umatilla, Oregon. We took over a housing unit there for nearly two hours and laid waste to it. We destroyed televisions, computers, fax machines, soda and ice machines, files, phone systems, all the windows on the unit, even the ceiling. We also flooded the entire unit. Having no weapons, we ceded control of the unit when the prison's "Tactical Emergency Response Team" (TERT) arrived with shotguns, pistols, and an M16. After we had surrendered and were lying face down on the floor, the TERT threw a concussion grenade at us. We were then stripped naked and forced to lie handcuffed in between glass and water. Finally, we were marched - still nude - through the prison to segregation. We had caused over $57,000 dollars worth of damage to Oregon Department Of Corrections (ODOC) .
Personal reasons for this action varied with the individual taking part. While I cannot speak for my comrades, I can say that none of us belong to a "white supremacist splinter group," as was portrayed in the ODOC's press releases - releases that were faithfully reprinted with no independent corroboration in the state's lousy rag The Oregonian. Speaking for myself, my motivation, as mentioned above, was to attempt to win back from the ODOC our educational programs, to ease the restrictions on Native Americans, and to get some sort of recreational programs at Two Rivers. Further - and more importantly - I had hoped that our example would be picked up and emulated by prisoners across the state. I had hoped that other prisoners would see that one does not always have to accept the abuse, that ways of fighting back exist. Finally, because I believe that the truly revolutionary moment will be the result of constantly engaging in "insurrectional moments at ever-closer intervals." I was simply doing my part.
That was a year ago. Since then, I have been locked down 23 hours a day - first for six months in the "Disciplinary Segregation Unit" (the hole), and for the last five months here in the "Intensive Management Unit" (the hole). According to the people who run this place, I'll be in the hole at least until September 2002, and probably until February 2003 (despite the fact that I am scheduled to parole on August 23, 2002).
On October 3, 2001, I was indicted by a Grand Jury of Umatilla County on three new felony charges: Riot, Criminal Mischief 1, and Inmate in Possession of a Weapon. These charges carry a possible combined total of thirty years in prison. After the District Attorney illegally postponed my arraignment for nearly three months, I was arraigned by video court on December 26, 2001, and my trial was set for April 19, 2002 - my 24th Birthday.
Since December 26, the only contact I've had with an attorney has been a letter from mine on December 31 stating his intent to withdraw from my case. Despite my attempts, I have been unable to ascertain the nature of the evidence against me. I have no idea what the District Attorney is attempting to do, or how much time he is pushing for (although I've been told everything from five to twelve years). Although years of my life hang in the balance, I am being kept entirely in the dark by the state of Oregon. Whether or not this is intentional, I do not know.
This much I do know: Every available weapon will be used against me in this case - including the tragic events of September 11 - as they will be used against every revolutionary comrade with the courage to strike back against the state and capitalism. That the state would use thousands of dead bodies as a means to further oppression illustrates the point I made in my previous article "The States Are The Real Terrorists" (see Break The Chains  available for $1 at the PO Box below) - the state is afraid. It has been made afraid by the growing number of insurrectionary and explicitly anti-state and anti-capitalist actions over the last five years. It fears these courageous actions because it cannot control them, it cannot stop them. It fears their inherent lack of hierarchy. This fear, along with the state's newly acquired weapon of September 11, puts me - and every other revolutionary comrade - in a very precarious position. We cannot allow this to make us hesitant - we must proceed - despite the state's paltry consequences. As I have said before, the state assumes that if it locks enough people away for long enough periods of time, the movement will disappear. We must continue to challenge that assumption. No one else can liberate us: We must free ourselves.
FOR MORE INFORMATION, CONTACT: Break The Chains, PO Box 11331, Eugene, OR 97440. Thomas Tripp is in serious need of financial and emotional support. Monetary donations can be made out to "Uncivilized Books," and can be sent to the address above.

>From Tacoma LPSG
Greetings All,
   Things are looking good for our march and rally. We have folks coming in
as far away as Montana from the east, Vancouver, B.C. from the north and
Salem, OR
from the south. I wish to thank everyone who has helped out.
   Our Leonard Peltier support work is about as grassroots as any struggle
can be. We are
completely dependent upon supporters to carry the message out to the people
of Leonard Peltier's case and the events we organize for him. Also, we get
no foundation grants or money from big organizations. All the funds we use
to keep organizing for Leonard comes from donations from supporters. We do
not waste a penny of donations. All money goes into fliers, posters and our
mailings. At this time with the Feb. 9th event we are a little over $200 in
debt. We are hoping that with this appeal we can raise the money
to pay off our debt and maybe have a little left over to use for our spring
organizing. Please if you can and are willing send a donation to: NWLPSN,
c/o SLPSG, P.O. Box 2514, Seattle, WA 98111.
   As we seek to involve more and more people in Leonard's case and events,
we are asked a number of questions. First folks are always asking us how
does Leonard's case relate to all the other struggles taking place such as
peace, environmentalism, human rights, labor and anti-corporate
globalization to name a few? If you look into Leonard's case you will see
that Leonard was a Native worker (farm worker and carpenter) who learned
first hand about the conditions of labor, something he has written and
spoken about. He took a stand against the multinational corporate rape of
Mother Earth and that was a major reason for what happened on Pine Ridge.
The resistance of the acts of genocide by the Native People of this land has
been about resisting the war against Native people and that they should have
the same human rights as other people have. So it does not take much
understanding to see all the connections between Leonard's case and most
other struggles.
   While it is true we work hard to get the message about Leonard's case out,
please don't take that as meaning that we wish for everyone to stop all else
that they are doing and just work for Leonard. Rather what we seek is to get
Leonard to be included in the many agendas of social activists. If folks
were to stop all else there would be two major problems with that. First,
the powers of repression use repression as a means to suppress the work of
the struggles. If we all stopped the work of those struggles to defend
people like Leonard then the powers of repression will have won. Thus, at
the same time we seek to defend people like Leonard we much also keep our
other work going. Second, some
of our best resources comes from folks involved in other struggles that use
those resources from time to time to help Leonard. Thus, if they were not
active in other things those resources would be lost to us.
   Some folks ask us why do we continue our campaign for Leonard? At what
point does one just give up because it seems so hard to continue? We know
that this work is hard and at times very frustrating. But we also know that
there is no hope in giving up. For the issues that are connected to Leonard'
s case and for Leonard the person, the struggle must go on and it will. We
all hope for a better world and the only way that will ever come about is by
commitment and continuous effort. We will not back down, we will not give
up, we will not stop UNTIL FREEDOM IS WON!

  UNTIL FREEDOM IS WON!
   STATEMENT FOR THE FEBRUARY 9TH, 2002
   INTERNATIONAL DAY IN SOLIDARITY WITH LEONARD PELTIER
   TACOMA MARCH AND RALLY FOR JUSTICE
   Leonard Peltier, (Lakota/Ojibway) American Indian Movement (AIM) activist,
has been locked for the Last 27 years, having been framed by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on the charge of killing two FBI agents at a
firefight between the FBI and AIM on the Oglala Lakota Pine Ridge
Reservation. The FBI was at Pine Ridge as a part of the plan to suppress the
traditional Lakota people and their AIM supporters for their opposition to
the illegal theft of Lakota land for uranium mining. In the two years before
the firefight over 60 Traditional Lakotas and AIM members had been murdered
by a death squad on Pine Ridge. On the day of the firefight roads in the
area of the AIM encampment were blocked, hospitals were warned to expect
wounded and 1/8 of Pine Ridge was being illegally turned over to the U.S.
government. The FBI sent into the area of the AIM encampment two unmarked
cars in the same manner as other drive by shootings had taken place at Pine
Ridge. A firefight took place and two FBI agents and one AIM member died. In
the first trial of two AIM members they were found not guilty for reason of
self-defense. In the trial of Leonard Peltier the court would not allow
self-defense evidence, ballistics tests were falsified and witnesses were
intimidated. Even though Leonard's lawyers disproved the government's case
against Leonard in the appeals to the point that the government stated they
had no real evidence connecting Leonard to any deaths, the courts would not
grant Leonard a new a fair trial. In 1993 a petition for Executive Clemency
was filed but because of pressure by the FBI President Clinton did not
approve it.
   Currently there are two lawsuits and one appeal that are being worked on
by Leonard Peltier's legal team. For updates on Leonard's case, how to can
donate to Leonard's legal fund please go to the Leonard Peltier Defense
Committee web site at:    The Tacoma Leonard Peltier Support Group, Native People's Alliance, and
The Northwest American Indian Movement are co-sponsoring the Annual
International Day In Solidarity With Leonard Peltier March And Rally in
Tacoma, WA on Saturday, February 9, 2002. February 6th marks the 27th year
since Leonard's arrest. Our annual event is always held on the Saturday
after February 6th so that more people can attend.
   We are committed to keeping Leonard's case out in the public UNTIL FREEDOM
IS WON! This is an important time in Leonard's case with the two lawsuits
and the new appeal being filed. Public support for Leonard is needed if
there is any hope for justice for Leonard. Please, we ask you that if you
can to please join us in Tacoma for our march and rally. We are also in need
of donations for our on going campaign. Please send them to: NWLPSN, c/o

  FEBRUARY 6, 2001 MARKS 27 YEARS OF SHAME
  RENEW YOUR SUPPORT FOR LEONARD PELTIER!
  Nearly 27 years ago, on February 6, 1976, Leonard Peltier was arrested.
 >From that day forward Leonard Peltier has lived his life from the confines
  of a prison cell.  For some, the 27-year-old struggle to free Peltier has
  become hopeless and mundane, with the same efforts, the same obstacles, and
  the same defeats year after year.  For Leonard Peltier, time passes even
  slower; with the same prison walls and the same prison clothes, and the
  routines never changing.  For Leonard Peltier, February 6 approaches like a
  nightmare that seems inevitably to repeat itself, bringing the realization
  of yet another year spent in prison, away from family, friends and an
  ever-changing world.
  However, the year 2002 will be far different than any other.  For the first
  time the FBI and other officials will be directly challenged for lying and
  deceiving those who had the authority and duty to correct this grave
  injustice long ago. Also, the year 2002 will very likely involve the
  exposure of evidence suppressed for decades, shedding new light upon
  Peltier's case and the struggle from which his case was born.
  Let's mark February 6, 2002 by renewing our commitments and active support
  and by preparing for the months to follow.  Without you, hope for justice
  collapses.  With you, the year is bound to bear many promising
  developments that could very well lead to freedom.

@_subject: One to warm the cockles of Otto Reich's heart. 
Despite a ban on all demonstrations by Munich Council 10,000 people still protested against the NATO Conference on Security Policy last weekend, where government officials hobnobbed with 500 odd military experts. Central themes were the planning of current and future wars, the establishment of powerful mobile strike forces and the development of new billion-dollar weapons systems. A few days before, the city council passed a law declaring all protests during the Conference illegal. The whole city was declared a 'red zone', road blocks, were set up preventing people getting to Munich by train, coach or car, known activists were warned in letters and phone calls not to protest, organized info points and sleeping places were closed down and several people were arrested before it all began. The police then desperately tried to prevent meetings and spontaneous demonstrations during the next three days, arresting people at random - 849 people in total - including a speaker at a press conference! Bans on demos are common in Germany, with one protestor telling SchNEWS "People usually still go ahead but it gives the cops more powers to nick people." The main Trade Union building was surrounded by police for several hours, with people complaining that the last time the police threatened an official trade-union building was in 1933 when the Nazis seized power.

@_subject: Spoonerism's,the best argument for anarchism. 
A great but little-known nineteenth-century American, Lysander Spooner.
Spooner's position was simple. There is a moral law, which in essence we all learn in early childhood, even before we know our math tables. Basically it is this:
Don't harm other people. The principle is simple, even if its applications may occasionally be difficult.
 From this, Spooner reasoned, it follows that no state should exist. Nobody can claim the power to change the moral law or a monopoly of the authority to enforce it. But the state claims the right to do both. It tries to change the moral law by legislation, which is falsely thought to add to the moral duties of its subjects; and it insists that only it may define, outlaw, and punish wrongs.
The results of the states claims include war, tyranny, slavery, and taxation. Human society would be better off without the state.
The best argument for anarchism is the twentieth century. One scholar, R.J. Rummel, calculates that states in that century murdered about 177 million of their own subjects - and that figure doesnt even count international wars. Its inconceivable that private criminals could kill that many.

Arrested in NY (english)
by watchoutfortheman 12:36am Thu Feb 7 '02
Rough treatment for youth protesters...
First of all, I'm sure people have had far worst experiences from cops than me but all those I protested with made a specific point not to break the law and we were still targeted and arrested. That is wrong and pisses everyone off, no matter how poor or harrased by the police you are.
I was arrested at the earth/animal rights march. I was immediately strapped into plastic cuffs so tight I was in constant pain. My hands turned purple and my thumbs and fingers went numb. The numbness wore off eventually and turned into excruciating pain, the feeling as if my hands would start hemorraghing through the pores so much blood was being forced into them. I was in those cuffs from the street, to the van and van ride and into a holding facility in an old Brooklyn naval base for a total of about two hours. My thumbs are still numb three days later. Some of those cuffed were screaming and writhing on the van floor the pain was so excruciating. I whistled to try to lighten the mood a little but no one could focus on very much but the pain. Some people were in those cuffs for upwards of nine hours while other people's wrist's bled. The cells there were from about 10x20 feet to 20x30 feet. They were completely conctrete and these horribly bright fluorescent lights were on 24 hours a day. We were constantly being monitored by shifts of NYPD. Most people were in their cells for over thirty hours. I got about 2 hours of sleep during the time I was in the system. All throughout the night we were being led away to be "interviewed" by the cops. I didn't tell 'em a damn thing you can be sure. After a while we organized a jailhouse solidarity and would pile on people that they tried to remove from the cell. We wouldn't even allow ourselves to be finger-printed. This annoyed the cops to no end but they never forced us to do anything and so we made our point. We were fed several varieties of the finest in prison baloney sandwiches and some honey and peanut butter sandwiches, fruit, rice and spinach, milk and fake purple fruit drink. I'm thinking they must have felt sorry for us to give us all that; I think they were actually sharing there lunch with us! When they finally took me to the courthouse I got through relatively quickly, in about 3 hours although I knew of some people who had to stay there an additional night. I don't know if it matters but I was never read my rights and I was charged with three misdeamenors. They have no case against us and we think a series of class-action lawsuits is a good idea. All in all I'd say it was a good experience, our cooperation gave us some control of the situation and taught us valuable lessons about "jailhouse solidarity".

@_subject: Reward for whereabouts of IRA rat.1,000.000$ or B.U.Ms. 
Intelligence Flows as MI5, FBI and the Garda use American for Incredible Not many people outside of the intelligence community will have known too much about a man called David Gary Rupert. Yet the 6ft 4 inches giant who claims to have German and Mohawk indian blood in him has been at the centre of one of MI5s most daring operations.
David Rupert was to many in republican circles a modest and mysterious American character, often flying in from the US to deliver funds raised for jailed prisoners or republican organisations.
Weighing in at over 20 stones he first surfaced at a IFC (Irish Freedom Committee) meeting in Chicago in 1997. He introduced himself as a lorry driver with no fixed address. He told members at the meeting that his real name was Scott Post. Born in Madrid, New York State he was regarded as a rebel and a loner. As a young man he went from one job to another and even crossed the Atlantic and obtained a tenancy on a bar in County Leitrim. After that he returned to the Chicago area and bought a lorry, hoping to shift haulage across the vast network of roads that cross America. All along however he mixed with Irish dissidents and fund-raisers in Chicagos huge Irish population.
Somewhere along the line he became disillusioned and sold his truck. He was a well-known figure at meetings and became the talk of the IFC. Many believed he had contacts that wended their way to the very top of organisations like Sinn Fein and the IRA. The groups were very suspicious of US intelligence, especially the FBI who they referred to as the "FRONT for BRITISH INTELLIGENCE." Amazingly they couldnt have been more correct.
MI5 had successfully tracked US fund-raising efforts to certain US citizens and groups through bank accounts. But they needed more information. Together with the FBI and Irish security police, they spoke to Mr Rupert who agreed to work for them as a double agent. It was a major coup.
Throughout the last four years he has supplied intelligence on fundraising, bank accounts, and recruiting campaigns. He "networked" between various rival factions and was so trusted he eventually befriended members of the Real IRA and several political organisations, such as the 32 County Sovereignty Committee. Similarly, he was befriended by Martin Galvin, a New York lawyer and the head of Noraid, the American fundraising arm of the Provisional IRA. Rupert was given codes and access to various associated groups and learned of leading personnel on both sides of the Atlantic. As Rupert forwarded donations to Ireland and elsewhere, MI5, the FBI and the Garda were carefully following the transactions, collecting details of every bank account the money was channelled through. In 1999 Rupert met with Michael McKevitt, who MI5 believe is the head of the Real IRA. Mr McKevitt is said to have introduced Rupert to other leading players in the group. And, according to sources, he handed over a £10,000 donation to cement relations.
Rupert told the Garda that the organisation was planning a series of top-level meetings at a certain location. The Irish security services planted listening devices and surveillance equipment in the room. Much evidence was apparently acquired and then the Garda asked MI5 and the FBI if it was time to act. The agencies mind was made up for them when Rupert said McKevitt had allegedly asked him to participate in a terrorist act. The Garda said that if they arrested McKevitt, Rupert would have to testify and this meant blowing his cover. MI5 knew they were about to lose one of their most important agents, but the prize they believed was worth it. Rupert agreed to testify for a massive sum of money and a new identity. He was also relocated.
The Garda swooped and arrested Mr McKevitt and charged him with "direct paramilitary operations." The trial is expected to take place in September at a special criminal court in Dublin. Since then the Garda has hinted that they have a "secret weapon" in the trial, undoubtedly a reference to the 49-year-old Rupert.
The Real IRA have been accused of the Omagh bombing in 1998, which resulted in the deaths of 29 people. There most audacious attack was the rocket strike against the SIS headquarters in London last year. Details of reward offer to pr.

What Is Anarchism?
First off, all notions that anarchism stands for chaos, disorder, violence, laissez-faire capitalism, structurelessness, terrorism, and "everyone for themselves" needs to be abandoned in order for one to have a clear understanding of what anarchism is actually about. In fact, it can be said that anarchism is actually the opposite of all of that. However, despite this fact, a great many mis-conceptions, mis-understandings, slander, and media-portrayals of negative stereotypes of anarchists has occurred all over the world for hundreds of years. The cumulative effect of all of this has led to most people considering anarchism, especially "anarchy", as one of those things that I listed above. With most people having this negative prejudice towards anarchism, many naturally do not want to try and learn anything about it, and hence the cycle of ignorance is perpetuated.
Anarchism is the social, economic and political theory that all forms of hierarchy, domination, authority, and coercion are wrong and should be abolished and replaced with new forms of inter-acting that are based on voluntary cooperation, direct participatory democracy, free association and mutual aid. Because of these core beliefs, anarchism advocates the complete abolition of all forms of capitalism, government, racism, sexism and homophobia. Anarchism sees capitalism and government as being institutions fundamentally based upon hierarchy, domination, authority, and coercion, whereas it views racism, sexism and homophobia as being inter-personal expressions of the same things.
Anarchism sees order and organization without authority and government as being possible, desirable and, to some extent, already existing in some small forms today. Anarchism seeks to create new forms and structures of relating and organizing without government and authority, as well as expanding upon the already existing ones.
There is a wide and diverse variety of anarchists, anarchist beliefs, tactics, and visions of a future anarchist society. There are eco-anarchists, union-centered anarchists, anti-God anarchists, Christian and Jewish anarchists, pacifist anarchists, animal rights-centered anarchists, class struggle-centered anarchists, pro-technology anarchists, anti-technology anarchists, etc etc. However, the things that unites all of these anarchists is the core beliefs that I wrote above(although each individual anarchist would think about and express this core unifying sentiment in a different and unique way).
To learn more about anarchism, I suggest that you read this essay.
For an even larger and more in-depth introduction to anarchism, I recommend that you visit An Anarchist FAQ.

Man jailed after death threats
 From AP
February 06, 2002
A MAN who threatened to blow up the White House and cut off the heads of two US presidents has been sentenced to more than 19 years in prison.
Eric James Temple, 25, apologised, saying he had "tried to always better my life, but it always comes to a failure".
He asked US District Judge John Steele to send him to prison because he had no family and no home.
The Florida court heard Temple had mailed numerous letters to federal officials since first threatening to kill President George W. Bush, former President Bill Clinton and three federal prosecutors.
"When I come for each of you individually, I'm going to cut your heads off, rip your eyes out and cook your bodies for a holiday meal," Temple wrote in one letter to a prosecutor last October.
He also threatened to blow up the White House with a nuclear bomb.
Temple pleaded guilty in June 2001 to making threats against the presidents and the prosecutors and mailing threatening communications.
He was serving four years in jail for battery on a law enforcement officer when he began mailing the letters in January 2001. A Quiet American hero.The jim bell make a wish Foundation is working on your requests.

The FBI has also admitted its IT infrastructure needs a major overhaul, having had no "meaningful improvement" in six years.
"Criminals have begun to exploit technology advances, while the FBI cannot," assistant director Bob Dies said.
The bureau will invest in "correcting basic IT problems", starting with the Trilogy Program to give agents IT tools and capabilities similar to those available to business users.
Trilogy will initially provide a secure intranet for FBI offices with email and web browsers.
Automation of investigative applications will improve sharing of information.
The FBI has also launched a Joint Cybercrime and Infrastructure Protection Task Force.

What if they could go to their computers, type in the miscreant's name, and select a dollar amount: The amount they, themselves, would be willing to pay to anyone who "predicts" that officeholder's death.

Activists con TV shows
By VANESSA WILLIAMS
A CURRENT Affair and Today Tonight have been duped by masked activists pretending to be food-scavenging, drain-dwelling bludgers raising a "dole army" on the Internet.
The group, called the Dole Army, used the stunt to promote their website and test how far the programs would go to verify stories, a spokeswoman for the group said.
ACA and Today Tonight ran the story on Monday.
In the stories, the group said they chose not to work, lived in tunnels and drains and scavenged bins for food.
Dole Army member Agent Koala, who refused to give her real name, also claimed Today Tonight footage of tunnels beneath Melbourne was actually filmed in a 10m-long tube-like structure above ground in a disused Brunswick brick factory.
Today Tonight's Melbourne supervising producer Steve Carey said his crew had assured him part of the film was shot underground. Mr Carey said the program had taken the group "in good faith".
Yesterday, he called them "faceless liars".
The show, aired on Channel 7, gave the Dole Army $1000 for their story, after the group demanded payment for an interview, because it was in the public interest for people to be informed of their activities, Mr Carey said.
Agent Koala alleged Channel 9's A Current Affair also offered $2000 to stop them talking to the rival show and gave them 30 blank digital tapes.
ACA producer Allen Craig denied money was offered but said tapes were given after the Dole Army gave them footage.
"They asked for money . . . there was no way in the world I was going to pay nameless people in balaclavas," Mr Craig said.
The Dole Army is a group of 70 activists, comprising the unemployed and employed, actors, artists and university students, which runs a website for the unemployed.

@_subject: UK Food Facts. 
FOOD FIGHT "Everywhere on these Isles, rich and beautiful habitats have been ploughed, bulldozed and sprayed out of existence, not as a result of need but in response to farm subsidies" - Graham Harvey, The Killing of the Countryside This week the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming published its long awaited report on what they see as the future of agriculture in the UK. Commissioned by the government in the wake of the foot and mouth crisis, it recommends changes in the way we produce our food, namely that more money be spent on organic farming methods and subsidies towards the protection of the environment rather than for food production. Foot and mouth was just the latest in a long line of disasters to illustrate the unhealthy state of UK farming. Since the introduction of subsidies in the last few decades, farming has largely become an industrialised process just like any other manufacturing industry. Many parts of Britain could be described as agricultural wastelands, devoid of wildlife and plants. Look out across the countryside in some parts of the UK and you'll see endless fields of chemically contaminated monocrop, separated not by hedgerows but by roads and barbed wire. Over 10,000 miles of hedgerows disappear each year. 97% of meadowland has been lost since WW2, and many water courses have been heavily polluted through extensive f chemical use. Prof. Jules Pretty of the University of Essex has calculated that even before foot and mouth, the hidden costs of industrial agriculture to our health and environment added up to £2.3billion a year. It's estimated that in the last 2 years at least 40,000 people have lost their jobs in agriculture. Many people have come to accept the failures of the modern farming system as the price we have to pay for cheap food. But with the taxpayer contributing to the £3billion in subsidies paid to farmers each year, each family is actually paying an extra £10 a week. Supermarket Sweep On the face of it we'd have to agree with Tony Blur for once, who welcomed the new report saying that "the current situation benefits no-one: farmers, taxpayers, consumers or the environment." But er, sorry Tony but we think Tesco might disagree with you there. Supermarkets are raking it in, with Tesco's profits rising every year in the last decade, last year amassing over £1bn. The supermarkets' power on our food chain has become almost complete, and the result has been that our agricultural land now looks like the supermarkets they are servicing. A fifth of farms, mostly the wealthy ones in this country received 80 percent of the annual production subsides. This mis-distribution of subsidies has been compared to the government choosing to subside grocery shops, and giving all the money to Tescos and Sainsbury's. And farming just like the retail world has had it's casualties - small farms are closing all the time while the large monoculture farms (yer Tesco equivalent) keep growing. But even these big farms are being screwed by the supermarkets they serve. For example a litre of milk in March last year costs 22p to produce, farmers were being paid 17.6p for each litre, the supermarket was selling it for 35p, that's 17.4p profit for supermarkets and a bill of 4.4p to tax payer for subsidies, which means that we are subsidising the supermarkets! Overall today in the UK only 9p of each pound you spend ends up in the farmer's pocket. Food Chained Marion Shoard the author of "This Land is Our Land" told SchNEWS that this idea of environmental subsidies assumes that farmers know what's best, yet considering that they're the ones who've been busy destroying the landscape in the first place, putting our faith in them helping to restore it is a bit laughable. Marion believes that the best way to shake up our agricultural system is to get rid of subsidies altogether. She believes that land prices would then plummet and farming would become more profitable, this would then allow land to be bought by environmental and social groups for the public good. This sounded like a good idea so we tried to track down some farmers who've managed to survive without subsidies, but unfortunately we couldn't find any. Not surprising really when the price farmers get for their produce is often less than it costs them to produce it in the first place. But regardless of whether or not redirecting subsidies are the solution to our problems, nothing is likely to change until there is a serious shift in the balance of power in the food chain. The biggest villains of all are the supermarkets who've made us believe they're providing us with cheap food. The report does nothing to challenge the powers of supermarkets, which isn't surprising when you consider that Peter Davis from Sainsbury's was a member of the Committee. Professor Pretty points out "The quest for even cheaper food is at the root of all these problems. It has encouraged farmers to cut corners, compromising food safety, animal welfare and damaging the environment." * Further reading "The Killing of the Countryside" by Graham Harvey. For a history of the landownership in Britain read "This Land is Our Land - The struggle for Britain's Country" By Marion Shoard. Loads of information on supermarkets at

It shows police firing rubber bullets into a relatively peaceful crowd, kicked and beating non-resisting people who were being dragged and arrested by cops, etc. etc. 44 people were arrested. 23 people are still in jail, including people who were beaten. This is no doubt to hide evidence of bruises, etc. 9 are being charged with felony assaults on police officers. (Throwing snowballs or other means of self-defense.) This is probably one of the biggest mass arrests and police brutality cases in Poland in a long time and we are asking people to help by writing about this and writing fax of protest.

@_subject: Vernon Richards Obit. 
Vernon Richards His single-minded efforts helped keep the anarchist voice alive Colin Ward Monday February 4, 2002 The Guardian Across seven decades, Vernon Richards, who has died aged 86, maintained an anarchist presence in British publishing. His chosen instrument was Freedom Press, based in Whitechapel, in London's east end. He edited the anarchist paper Freedom - and its prewar and wartime variations - into the 1960s. Earlier, he had been imprisoned in 1945, written a biography of the Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta, and photographed George Orwell. Born Vero Recchioni in Soho, Vernon was the son of the Italian anarchist Ernidio Recchioni, who had escaped from what was then the prison island of Pantelleria in the 1890s, set up the famous Italian delicatessen King Bomba, in Soho, and taken part in interwar plots to assassinate Mussolini. Vernon was educated at Emmanuel school, Wandsworth, and graduated in civil engineering from King's College London in 1939. In his Soho childhood, he had been taught the violin by the conductor John Barbirolli's uncle, and had performed the orchestral repertoire. By 1934, he was becoming active in the battle against Mussolini, and, in 1935, was deported from France, where he had met the Italian anarchist Camillo Berneri, and fallen in love with his daughter, Marie-Louise. Back in London, he anglicised his name to Vernon Richards and, collaborating with Berneri in Paris, started publishing Free Italy/Italia Libera. In 1936, the year the Spanish civil war began, Vernon joined the veterans of Freedom - founded in the 1880s, it had effectively ceased publication by 1932 - to produce Spain And The World as an English-language voice for Spanish anarchists. This was at a time when the only version of events in Spain being heard on the left in Britain was that of the News Chronicle and New Statesman, supporting the Soviet-backed popular front. In October 1937, Marie-Louise joined Vernon in London, and, to give her citizenship, they married. She and their baby died in childbirth in 1949. Between the end of the Spanish civil war and the outbreak of the second world war, the fortnightly Spain And The World briefly became Revolt!, before adopting the title War Commentary. Registered as a conscientious objector, Vernon worked in a reserved occupation as a railway engineer. In 1945, War Commentary resumed the title of Freedom. The previous year, however, four of the group around the paper - Vernon, Marie-Louise, Philip Sansom and John Hewetson - had been charged with conspiring to cause disaffection among members of the armed forces. Despite a defence campaign backed by the likes of Orwell, Michael Tippett, TS Eliot and Benjamin Britten, Vernon, Sansom and Hewetson were convicted and served nine months in jail. Prison gave Vernon the chance to resume playing the violin, and indeed, form a scratch band with other incarcerated musicians. Friends regretted that he never played again after his release. He never practised as a civil engineer again either, saying that the one thing he learned in prison was the folly of pursuing a "career". Instead, he ran the family business at 37 Old Compton Street, Soho, until it was sold in the 1950s. He also worked as a freelance photographer -producing latterly famous images of Orwell in the mid-1940s - and as an organic gardener and travel courier. Convinced that the links formed by tourism were a liberatory influence, opening closed frontiers, he went to Franco's Spain and the Soviet Union. In 1968, he and Peta Hewetson moved to a smallholding in Suffolk, where, for almost 30 years, Vernon produced vegetables for the organic market. After 1951, he continued to edit Freedom as a weekly, and wrote, in weekly instalments, his continually reprinted and translated Lessons Of The Spanish Revolution (1953). He quit as Freedom's editor in 1964, but assumed the role again whenever he felt that others were pushing it in the wrong direction. It was not until the 1990s that he finally stopped writing for the paper. By this time, Freedom Press, as an anarchist publisher, had a spectacular range of books in print. Looking for the source of Vernon's single-mindedness, friends assumed that his father had set him in motion, though I once heard him dismiss Ernidio as a "bourgeois terrorist". The anarchist who influenced him most was Malatesta. In his dedication, Vernon was a quite ruthless exploiter of others. None of the group he had inspired in the 1940s - Sansom, Hewetson, and George Woodcock - were on speaking terms with him at the times of their deaths. Unable to recognise himself as a manipulator, he saw their withdrawal from his circle as proof that they had been seduced by capitalist values. At the end of the 1990s, admirers sponsored the publication by Freedom Press of four books of Vernon's photographs. In 1999, the Centre For Catalan Studies produced an album of his pictures, taken after 1957 while he was escorting holidaymakers to the then poverty-stricken Catalan village of L'Escala. For local families, the book became a precious record of their grandparents, their dignity and hard times. Peta predeceased him in 1997. · Vernon Richards (Vero Recchioni), writer and publisher, born July 19 1915; died December 10 2001

@_subject: Anarchist FAQ's 
hello all
"An Anarchist FAQ" webpage has been updated. It can be found at:
                                                    (The last address is generally updated first)
An Anarchist FAQ is an in depth introduction to anarchist ideas, ideals
and history. Find out why anarchism is opposed to hierarchy, state and
capitalism. Find out what different types of anarchism there is and why it
is also called libertarian socialism. Find out why anarchists oppose the
present system and what they aim to replace it with.
It has been updated on February 5th to mark  the birth
of German anarchist Johann Most.
Initially a social democrat, he was elected to the Reichstag
from 1874 to 1878. He was forced into exile for his
writings against the Kaiser and clergy and arrived in
London in 1878. There he published the newspaper
"Freiheit" (Freedom). An article celebrating the assassination
of  Tsar Alexander II landed him in jail for 16 months.
Upon release Most went to the United States in 1882 and
quickly became an anarchist. He continued to publish
"Freiheit" and went on lecturing tours preaching social
revolution and supporting  propaganda by the deed. After
the Haymarket events of 1886, Most shifted from his advocay
of violence towards anarcho-syndicalism. "Freiheit" remained
the focus for the rest of his life (he died in 1906). He remained
a famed orator for his "incendiary speeches" and once
remarked with enthusiasm:
"Tyrants and the bourgeoisie hate me. I hate tyrants and the
bourgeoisie. Out mutual hatred is my pride and joy."
In addition, visit the updated FAQ links page with over 750 links to
anarchist webpages, organisations, papers, magazine, books, publishers

Book Description
This long-awaited work from one of the world's most respected scientists presents a series of dramatic discoveries never before made public. Starting from a collection of simple computer experiments---illustrated in the book by striking computer graphics---Wolfram shows how their unexpected results force a whole new way of looking at the operation of our universe.
Wolfram uses his approach to tackle a remarkable array of fundamental problems in science: from the origin of the Second Law of thermodynamics, to the development of complexity in biology, the computational limitations of mathematics, the possibility of a truly fundamental theory of physics, and the interplay between free will and determinism.
Written with exceptional clarity, and illustrated by more than a thousand original pictures, this seminal book allows scientists and non-scientists alike to participate in what promises to be a major intellectual revolution.

@_subject: Spleen transplant. 
The View From Leftward Ho
They call it "blogging," those onomatopoeic right-wingers  the practice of jotting down your immediate thoughts on how all liberals are scum on your personal website. I don't have personal website, but theSpleen'll do for a little blogging in the opposite direction of my own.
IMPRISON THEM ALL AND LET FIDEL SORT THEM OUT: There are plenty of things not to like about Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay. I won't get into them all, but one thing in particular strikes me as particularly fucked up. It hasn't been played up much, but one of the reasons the Bush Administration has given for holding prisoners captured in Afghanistan at the military base - and not in the US itself -- is that they are "among the most dangerous, best-trained, vicious killers on the face of the earth," according to Donald Rumsfeld.
Wouldn't want those vicious fuckers in the heart of America, now would we? Hell, they might escape and kill a bunch of Americans! But we've solved that, see? This way, if they escape, they'll only kill a bunch of dirty commie Cubans! And who cares about Cubans? They're a nation of degenerates who think parents' custody rights to their biological offspring supercede the rights of second cousins twice-removed!
Still, there would be a certain perverse logic to having "Tony al-Montana" in a Havana holding cell, proclaiming: "Dere ees noteen joo can do to me dat Rumsfeld has not done already!"
PERCENTAGES OF POPULATION: I have a gripe with a particular rhetorical device. It's when somebody evaluates an atrocity in terms of the percentage of the total population killed, rather than the actual number of deaths. It goes something like this: "Let us not forget that those who died in (Dresden/Hiroshima/Mae Lai), as a percentage of the overall population, represent (five, 50, 500) World Trade Centers blah blah blah " We've all heard this one in recent weeks, mostly from the left, but also from Ariel Sharon, who described several hundred Israeli dead in the latest Intifada as "our own World Trade Center" in terms of percentage of the population.
Probably the most bandied about example of this is East Timor, where various writers describe the 200,000 Timorese killed by the Indonesian military and militia groups as "greater than the Holocaust" in terms of  you guessed it.
What's my problem with this? It's stupid. 200,000 dead people is horrific enough without trying to somehow make it seem worse than 6 million plus dead people. And the reverse logic is inescapable: 6 million divided by 200,000 equals 1 Timorese life is worth 30 Jewish lives. Somehow, I don't think the writers who employ the population percentage trick really want to say this.
And we can take it even further. Roughly 3,000 people died in the World Trade Center. The total population of the US is about 300 million. Now just keep this in the back of your head and bear with me. Imagine a fictional Indian living in the Northern California wilderness in the early part of the last century. A group of anthropologists convince him to move into their museum - to become sort of a "living exhibit." He contracts tuberculosis and dies. The anthropologists, by bringing him into an environment where he would come into contact with diseases his immune system was woefully unprepared for, essentially killed him.
Here's the kicker: this guy really existed. His name was Ishi and he was the very last Yahi Indian alive in the world. Therefore, the anthropologists -- Alfred L. Kroeber and Theodore T. Waterman - are guilty of precisely 100,000 World Trade Centers. Just do the math.
Oh, and I happen to know a guy trying to liquidate a warehouse full of Alfred L. Kroeber and Theodore T. Waterman urinal targets. Send me an email if you're interested.
IN THIS CORNER  A BUNCH OF CREEPS: The website I love to hate, nationalreview.com, has a new in-house "blogging" board called "The Corner." In it you'll find such delightful debates as this one:
Mark Krikorian: "We should call the terrorists 'POWs' before we blow their brains out!"
Jonah Goldberg/Rich Lowery: "You bleeding heart! We should call them 'unlawful combatants' before we force them to choke to death on their own The nice thing about The Corner is that these armchair commandos basically post their gut reactions to the news of the day, without the self-editing they presumably conduct for their lengthier columns. (The joys of blogging.) So you get to see the full blackness of their hearts in each shameless display of hypocrisy-ridden, self-important drivel. Like this proclamation from Goldberg: "The pressure to 'internationalize' or 'Nurembergize' a war crimes trial would be monumental. If these guys go [to] the Hague, I'm lying down on the tarmac to stop it."
Apparently Golberg thinks "lying down on the tarmac" involves delivering a running commentary of smirking recriminations from a syndicated pulpit. But for sheer blindness to the principle that rules of conduct ought to apply to "us" as well as "them," this comment from Mark Krikorian in The Corner takes the cake: " the foundation of the customary law of war is that non-combatants must not be killed, and if you kill them, your life is forfeit -- and it's very much in our interest to reinforce this basic concept."
Either Krikorian is blissfully ignorant of the implications of this statement for certain American military planners, or I'm a formulaic Jonah Goldberg punchline.
MORE ON 'GITMO': Andrew Sullivan is a fairly reasonable guy, for such a deeply conflicted cunt. I think I like him the most out of the right-wing pundits, maybe because his conservative/Catholic/gay inner struggle makes him seem very human to me. I particularly like his recent attacks on mainstream journalists who've accepted Enron cash. But other times he morphs into the worst sort of representative of all his many identities, a kind of kill-em-all God botherer flinging balloons full of pink paint at "breeders." Here's his take on the Camp X-Ray prisoners: "These terrorists are not soldiers. They are beneath such an honorific. They are not even criminals. In that respect, Dick Cheney's and Donald Rumsfeld's contempt for the whines of those complaining about poor treatment is fully justified."
So they're not "soldiers." Hmm, well actually  okay, whatever. But they're "not even criminals" either? So what exactly is lower than a criminal? An evil non-human who must be executed on sight? "Terrorists!" Sullivan would exclaim. But what does this mean? The way the Bush Administration is playing it, al Qaeda members are "unlawful combatants." This means they're in the category of foreign spies and saboteurs captured domestically - something that happened during the Cold War, both by the US and the USSR. Regarding their treatment and rights, it's useful to point out that US spies captured in the USSR were generally given the brush off by the Americans. So I suppose there's some merit in arguing that since the US was willing to abandon its own unlawful combatants when they were captured (mainly to avoid embarrassment), the ones it captures can't expect better There would be some merit in that argument  IF these guys had been captured in the US. But they weren't. The Red Army never raided Quantico and captured a bunch of "unlawful combatants in training." You'd be reading this with all three eyes from behind your radiation mask if they had. Seeking the justification or non-justification for Camp X-Ray in historical precedence, international law, the Geneva Accords or even the US Constitution is certainly proper, but ultimately the issue boils down to our ideals of ourselves as a society, and the practical safeguards we have put in place to ensure that we maintain those ideals.
Plainly put, we consider ourselves an open society, and a crucial safeguard to maintaining our society as such is transparency in our elected government's pursuit of justice against those who harm our citizenry. This is a fundamental part of the "checks and balances" system we consider to be the most practical means available to make real the notion that particular minorities or majorities ought not to have runaway power over other people's lives.
This is not a simple situation by any means, however. It's certainly complicated by the fact that these are foreign nationals we're talking about. It's a bit more intuitive to say we want trials of US citizens to be transparent, because we happen to be US citizens.
Nor is "transparency" ever really possible in the ultimate sense. We all have to basically just trust each other - and our government and hopefully our media - on a regular basis.
All fine and well. And we may ask ourselves whether our Constitution applies to these prisoners in Camp X-Ray. But a more important question in my opinion is what do the core principles that gave rise to the Constitution have to say about this situation? Principles like: It's important to make sure that governments don't go around torturing, imprisoning and executing people in secret.
A LITTLE BIT OF ENRON: Since I'm not dealing with the news itself, but rather conservative reactions to the news, it would be criminal not to say a few things about Enron. I particularly love the line about how the collapse of Enron is a "triumph of capitalism"  parroted by Goldberg, among others. Why do I suspect that all these brave capitalists weren't exactly lining up to call Jimmy Hoffa's pilfering of Teamster pension funds "a triumph of labor organizing"? (Maybe because Goldberg wasn't even born back then?)
Another funny bit of scrambling by the right came with the release of a NY Times poll revealing that 58 percent of respondents think the Bush administration is "hiding something" about Enron  while, get this, JUST 9 PERCENT THINK BUSH & CO. ARE "LYING" ABOUT THE FAILED ENERGY COMPANY! The distinction between "hiding something" and "lying" is getting big play amongst right-wingers - who presumably would have commuted John Wayne Gacy's death sentence  seeing as how, while he certainly did HIDE a bunch of bodies under his house, he never LIED about them being there.
So there's my first "blogging" attempt, perhaps it won't be the last.

Poland, Warsawa: Action at Mercedes
On saturday 26th, an action at a Mercedes dealer was organised in Warsaw by the Polish anarcho-feminist group Emancypunx and people from the German autonomist movement. The action was a protest pointing at the very low and belated compensation money that the East European ex slave workers in Mercedes III Reich factories received. The action consisted of fake "tax collectors" who came to the car sales salon and marked all the cars with stickers saying they are being seized for the unpaid money. According to our correspondents, it took a while to the sales personel to figure out it was bogus.

@_subject: Human,civil and animal rights trampled by NYPD P.I.Gs.There 
An estimated 400 protesters gathered in the late afternoon on the east side of Central Park for an "earth and animals" march, part of the weekend's anti-WEF actions in New York City. Many marchers carried posters of mutilated beagles and monkeys, a reminder of the animal cruelty practiced by Huntington Life Sciences (HLS).
The march proceeded east on 76th street through to posh upper east side of Manhattan, surrounded by a large number of riot police -- perhaps 1/3 to 1/2 as many police as protesters. A window was smashed at a building on 76th near Lexington, reportedly the residence of a person connected to Stephens, Inc., which funds HLS.
After the window was broken, police moved in to tackle and arrest several protesters. The march was split, with part of the group heading east and others west. Chanting "same struggle, same fight, human freedom, animal rights," one of the smaller groups proceeded south, flanked by police on all sides. Near 63rd and 2nd Avenue, two of the previously divided groups were able to reunite.
Midway down the block on 63rd street between 2nd and 3rd Avenues, police again penned in protesters on all sides, giving an order to disperse or face arrest, but leaving protesters no way to exit. A police bus was brought in, and the police threatened to arrest all of the approximately 75-100 protesters present.
Eventually, representatives with the group were able to negotiate with police to let protesters depart. People were released in small groups of 2-4, spaced several minutes apart. Protesters were warned that it they attempted to regroup they would immediately be arrested. Police also threatened press (and even curious bystanders) with arrest if they did not leave the area.

The local media have played the well-known role of stirring up fear of "violence" by "leftwing extremists", who allegedly want to make Munich a "second Genoa". Thereby they have tried their best to justify heavy-handed police actions, a ban on protests and a criminalisation of protesters. They have effectively turned reality upside down by accusing anti-war protesters - and not the generals and army officials meeting in Munich - of "violence".

@_subject: Hoax about an act of Terror. 
Here are two translated letters from political prisoner Evgeni Novozhilov, who is in forced treatment in regional mental hospital in Krasnodar, Russia. He is arrested for bogus charges of "hoax about an act of terror". He explains reasons why FSB is after him in the letters below. Evgeni is not an anarchist, but he is a human rights activist and anarchist sympathizer, he showed up in actions of Autonomous Action in his hometown. Autonomous Action of Krasnodar is organising a support campaign for him since there are no any liberal human rights organisations around to do the job. However Autonomous Action is currently trying to figure out what is the best strategy, since his mother announced that she is a friend of director of Krasnodar mental hospital and in case campaign keeps low profile, she will be able to avoid treating Evgeni with heavy chemistry (usually Russian patients in prison mental hospitals become human vegetables in few years). So, what is best thing to do now is not yet clear, but meanwhile please write letters of support to Evgeni. You can write them to his home adress, from which his mother will pass the letters further: Evgeni Novozhilov ul. Ignatova 51, kv. 105 350061 Krasnodar Russia He speaks at least English, German and Swedish. Two letters from political prisoner in Krasnodar, Russia FIRST LETTER OF EVGENI NOVOZHILOV Dear Dmitri! I write to you from mental hospital of Krasnodar area, from prison section  to where I was sent by FSB (Former KGB, Ed.) 16th of November. In my "case of Krasnodarian Babitsky" there are some new details. For clarity I will tell my story right from the beginning. Thanks to me, the paper "Krasnodarskie izvestiya" published first and last time some materials about the real side of the Chechen war 20th of March 1999. In order to have these facts known, I claimed that I was fighting in the Chechen side 1996, and gave interview to journalist Valentin Kayuk. In my story I used materials from Radio Liberty, expecially those made by Anrey Babitsky. Redaction of KI published article with header "Cannibal from cannibal island", and added "a commentary" from general Pulikovsk, in which he justified his limitless cruelty during the first Chechen war, after which he found a safe heaven under protection of Samoylenko, who was the city governor of Krasnodar those days. General said to mr. Kayuk, that it is his civil duty to give me to FSB. Which later immediately did. Since March-April 1999 I have been continuously followed by FSB. First time FSB visited my home 17th of January 2000, claiming to check my passport. They took my passport, and ordered me to show up in the police station next day. 18th of January 2000 I was examined a long while by FSB, during which they clarified with help of a lie detector that I never fought in the side of the rebels. 10th of February 21.15 four police officials came to my home, lead by capitain Portnyh. They said that I am suspected of stealing a hat from an elder lady in front of my home 8th of February. They took me to police station for interrogation but never interrogated me. They took video footage about me, after which we had a lenghty political discussion. They let me go, because my mother had come with me. They asked me to come back the following day 10 AM in the morning for interrogation with person who had lost her hat. I came, but there was no any interrogation. 12 AM they said I am not suspected about anything, but soon a person will arrive who wants to have a talk with me. However no-one came, and 5 PM they let me go when my mum arrived. mr. Putin was visiting Krasnodar 10th-11th of February 2000, which is why this "special operation" was organised against me. 27th of December 2000, a week after I had called to Radio Liberty during a discussion about Chechen war, a police officer came to my home, accompanied by FSB agent, and said "What is this hooliganism of yours in the doorway? Visit me in the afternoon". I did not came to him, since I was seriously ill then and was almost unable to leave home. 11th of September 2001 I was called to an interrogation by the city procurator of Krasnodar, to be carried by coroner Sokol. He announced that some "veterans" had contacted city procuror demanding him to find "hero" of the article published in "Krasnodarskiy Izvestiya" one and half years earlier. Protocol was written in the form of "explanation" in the name of city procurator. 5th of November coroner Konstantin Stanislavovich Linov announced me, that I am suspected of having committed a crime "hoax about an act of terror". The proof were two telephone conversations, 6th of April 2001 with my friend Igor Morozov and 3rd of October 2001 with my acquintance Viktoria Podloznyaya (which they had tapped, Ed.). 6th of April I was in bad condition due to bad medical aid to chronical piodermia (skind disease with plenty of rankling sores all around the body), and in a telephone call with Igor Morozov I noted "I would like to blow up everyone and myself as well". 3rd of October 2001 I was still suffering piodermia, and due to failure with a woman I was in a bad mood. In a conversation with Viktoria Podloznyaya I said "I had such a feeling that I would like to hijack a plane and fly to a skyscraper". This is what I explained to coroner K.S. Linov 5th of November 2001. My regional residence permission was taken away from me. I refused from a public lawyer during interrogation. I heard from a source I may not reveal, that 8th of November coroner Linov yet did not knew what to do, since he had not enough proof to open up the case. I tried to seek help from human right organisations. Sergey Grigoryants from Glasnost foundation (Moscow), and Tatyana Kasatkina from Memorial (Moscow) were interested about my case, but Moscow is far and they were not able to do anything for me. In Krasnodar there are no any normal human right organisations, and all lawyers refused to help me since I have not money, so I was not able to find any help. After 8th of November Viktoria Podloznyaya changed her testimony. This I learnt 16th of November, when city prosecutor's office started prosecution. I had no lawyer, and I refused from services of public lawyer (which are not much better than in Soviet times when their main task was to jail their client, Ed. ). The only proof against me was tapped telephone conversation with Viktoriya Podloznyaya, and her testimony. She testimoned that he took my comment seriously, so I was accused that the hoax was given to a person - Viktoriya Podloznyaya. She also claimed that I had tried suicide by cutting my vains, which I have never done. Thanks to these lies coroner managed to send me to forced treatment to closed, "half-prison" section  of Krasnodar mental hospital. 16th of November I was carried to mental hospital by coroner Linov and FSB agent. I had 38.2 degrees of temperature. Coroner and FSB agent managed to pressure hospital staff to cancelall my rights. During 30 days I went through all of the testimony. FSB passed to psychiatrists plenty of materials, such as articles from "Krasnodarskiy Izvestiya", and plenty of citates from my telephone conversations with "anti-Russian" contents. Not very surprising, that I was given a diagnose. So now, until the court I will stay in mental hospital an undefined period. Court will be carried WITHOUT MY PRESENCE and will decide will I be kept further in forced treatment. Thus I have become a political prisoner, jailed in a mental hospital. I want to say few words about Viktoria Viktoriovna Poloznyaya, born 22th of August 1972, living in the city of Anapa, Krylov street 83-2, 353410 Krasnodar area Russia, phone +7-86133-50495, mobile phone +7-902-430-3761. She works in a local trading business. We met in the beginning of 1989 in rock-club organized by Seva Novgorodtseva from Russian BBC. First half of 1990 I visited her each week, I was in love with her. We splitted in September 1990, remaining friends. We did not met during ten and half years. In May 2001 I decided to call her. She was happy. She wanted to meet with me, since she visited Krasnodar each week due to her work. However somehow we did not managed to meet. I was intruded by my old memoirs and feelings, and tried to not to give it much attention. However I figured out that the company in which Victoria is working is connected to mafia, and I supposed we would not meet since I was not from their circle. And in the end, Viktoria showed that FSB of Anapa is connected to this same circle. So she sold me to her FSB-mafia friends. This was a big strike to me. However I do not want to be bitter towards her. She just made her choice. What can I say? Now I want to tell about myself. My name is Evgeni Vladimirovich Novozhilov, I was born 3rd of November 1972 in Sochi. 1977 I moved to Krasnodar with my parents, 1979-1989 I studied in school  1990-1995 I studied in state university of Kuban, in the faculty of German and Roman filology. After finishing the university I failed to find constant work due to my difference of opinions with employers of Krasnodar area. I am interested about human rights and humanitarian activism. I have also been heavy metallist for 14 years, which is music which managers do not like since it is anti-bourgeois. So I was living with short-time contracts. I am member of Amnesty International, as well as cultural society Sverigekontakt. In the March I got a serious skin disease, very unusual form of chronical piodermia. Two years, until april 2001, I suffered plenty of short-lived rankling sores all around the body. Between summer of 2000 and March 2001 I almost did not left home. In June 2001 I managed to get better, but then FSB decided to ruin my life. Things are bad, but one must to carry on anyway. Do you know if someone would like to write me (through my home adress, Evgeni Novozhilov, ul. I gnatova 51, kv. 106, 350061 Krasnodar). Quite stupid, I guess. But I am really sad and bored. I want someone to know what is going on with me. Eugene P. S. My coroner was changed 15h of December for some reason P.P.S. Name of my mother is Galina Ivanovna Smirnova SECOND LETTER OF EVGENI NOVOZHILOV Hi, ...! 29th of December 2001 city procurator's office passed my case to Soviet raynarsud (organ which decides about forced treatment of mental patients, notorious anti-dissident tool in the soviet era - Ed.). Prosecutor's office got results of "expertice" from mental hospital 13th of December already, so two weeks they were just letting papers to collect pile... court should decide about my case until 18th of January. Without my presence. My "diagnose" was not serious - "depressive syndrome". Medical treatment is not necessary. But it is completely possible that court sentences me to half years of forced treatment. Just remember that Pasko was given 4 years of hard regime, and not more only because he gained so wide support. So talk about me, I am necessary to no-one. And prison sentence of my "crime" was increased by special presidential decree by Putin 17th of December, so now they give 5-10 years for "hoax about an act of terror". My mood has stabilized, I try not to loose my spirit. It is possible to live here anyway. In any case it is better than in prison. I am training my Swedish and English. My section has tolerable conditions. No any special problems. I even met friends with some people. They have some 45-47 persons here, most of them normal people. In any case less sick than the staff. But food is very bad, 3 times better than in a prison but 3 times worse than home. Biggest problem is lack of information what is happening in the world outside. I miss Radio Liberty. Already during one and half months I have not heard normal news made by normal people. Isolation from information depresses me seriously. My friends, as I understand, have got afraid and runned away. That is sad. I have nothing special to tell now, as you may guess. Maybe you have something to tell? Best connection is through mum, Galina Ivanovna. She can pass me letters right to my hands. No pasaran! Evgeni P.S. In November and December I did not received information bulletin of Amnesty International from London. And in December I did not received journal of Swedish cultural society Sverigekontakt. P.P.S. The worst sin is the cowardice.

@_subject: Police brutality,bullying in NYC.Business as usual for 
This story was taken from IMC: Article by: Kathy Rosenfeld/Chicago Indymedia Saturday 02 Feb 2002 Summary:New York police harassed peaceful protests throughout Saturday\'s mobilizations against the World Economic Forum, in a display of police aggression many believe was designed to deny marchers legal access to their rally point at the WEF meetings -- and punish them for expressing dissent. Reference at indymedia website:  Article: WEF Update: An Eyewitness Account of Police Aggression In the past, whenever anyone says that police acted violently toward protesters there's been some small part of me that thinks there must have been something that provoked them. After what I saw in New York City today, even that small skeptical part of me won't be likely to doubt that cops instigate violence against protesters all on their own. Things began completely peacefully. There were lots of cops around, but their presence didn't dilute the celebratory atmosphere in Columbus Circle, where at least a thousand people gathered for the Reclaim the Streets march. In the middle of the plaza, street theater performers acted out parodies of billionaires, handing fake money to everyone to get them to go away. In one corner, members of Chicago DAN banged on pots and pans and sang in Spanish in a demonstration of solidarity with Argentina. Across the plaza, a 20-piece Samba band calling itself Reclaim the Beats warmed up the crowd, preparing to lead the march through Central Park to join the Another World is Possible contingent that was gathering at 59th and 5th. A few protestors climbed the statues to festoon them with banners, while others just hung out and enjoyed the brilliant sunshine and the festive energy. A Palestinian solidarity group behind a row of kaffiyeh scarves, an anarchist Cub Scout troupe, a group dressed as television sets displaying slogans like "Dissent is American," and a black bloc calmly walking hand in hand or arm in arm were among the many who marched through the park to meet up with the main, permitted AWIP march. After rallying across from the Plaza Hotel for at least 1/2 an hour, the march began to move forward on to its permitted route, led by huge, colorful papier mache puppets including a dragon about 40 feet long, its slogan-covered body housing a couple dozen puppeteers. As the march stepped off, police formed a solid line along the curb, not allowing the width of the march to extend off the sidewalk until it was across 5th Avenue. As the huge dragon and its accompanying fire birds went by, a line of protesters several deep was trapped between the puppet and the police, who did not budge. Several Chicago indymedia reporters were among this group, and we noticed two officers standing atop a paddywagon parked in the street, aiming a camera at the crowd. I had come out of the park amongst some of the black blocers, and it seemed to me the camera was aimed right at the spot where they had been standing, waiting to join the slow-moving march as were all the other people in the plaza. Around this time, a CIMC reporter also overheard an NYPD sergeant telling his officers to arrest anyone with a mask or shield. As we watched the march kick off, we noted that more and more of the cops behind us had their batons out and their riot shields down. The black bloc joined the march as all the other participating groups had, walking slowly forward and waiting to be allowed to cross 5th Avenue on to 59th Street. Most of the marchers had embarked by this point, but there were still several hundred people waiting to move, including many behind the black blocers-in other words, the black bloc did not appear to be bringing up the rear. As we stood watching them pass, completely without warning the cops behind and immediately to the right of us charged into the crowd, batons raised, in a cone formation. Before we knew it we were being roughly pushed back out of the plaza and on to the sidewalk, shoved against those behind us who did not have anywhere to move. The scene was chaotic, but we could tell that the same was happening to people on the other side of the plaza. Several people shouted to the cops, asking why we were being pushed when no one had done anything, and a few people were knocked down by the nightsticks and had to be helped up by fellow protesters. As we were being pushed up on to the sidewalk, practically immobilized between the line of nightsticks and the stone wall of the park behind us, an officer doused the crowd with pepper spray, hitting several people in the face at point-blank range. Meanwhile, in the now-cleared center of the plaza we could see several people being wrestled to the ground, face-down, and handcuffed by about 5 cops on each protester. While I only witnessed about a half dozen arrests, another observer later told me that he had seen a bus full of arrestees leaving this scene. Since New York 1 and CNN report 36 arrests with most occurring at this beginning point, it's probable that I missed a lot of them while I was busy coughing the pepper spray out of my throat. After a few minutes, the police allowed everyone remaining to freely cross the plaza and proceed on to 59th street. A middle aged, conservatively dressed woman beside me said that she had been knocked down by the police during the charge, and had to be helped up by 5 people. When she realized I was reporting for indymedia, she gave me a business card, identifying herself as a Cooper Union professor. Several other people around me, clearly not anarchists or black blocers, expressed amazement that the cops had charged a completely peaceful march. It was well-publicized that this permitted march was to be a green zone; many participants came expecting that they would not be exposed to arrest risk, and even direct action groups had willingly agreed to abide by this guideline. As I and countless other observers noted, the black bloc were doing nothing besides walking in the march when the police charged into their midst. The majority of them were unmasked, as well; a few wearing scarves over their faces and two or three carrying plastic shields against their bodies presented the only conceivable motivation for the cops' strike. At a televised press conference later, an NYPD spokesman said some protesters had hit cops with their shields. All I observed were police snatching the shields away from a few protesters who were trying to use them for protection. A few blocks later, at Park Avenue and 60th Street, the group of a few hundred marchers who had been divided from the others during the police charge caught up with the rest of the march, which had stopped to wait. Things were relatively peaceful for a while as we proceeded east on 60th and then south on Lexington. However, at each intersection cops in riot gear would amass in lines on either side of the march, concentrated heavily at the back near the black bloc, and followed block-to-block by a small fleet of paddywagons and a jail bus. Marchers repeatedly strategized to not allow the march to be broken up, stopping when necessary and even moving backward at some points. During this time, a few more arrests were made -- according to one observer I talked to, when a police barricade fell over and some protesters stepped on it. The march moved at a snail's pace, stopping several times as we moved down Lexington Avenue and West on to 46th Street. As the front of the march neared Park Avenue and the site of the Waldorf Astoria, the back of the march was repeatedly divided off by the police and prevented from moving for long stretches of time. It took us a good 3-4 hours to reach the permitted rally site caddy-corner to the Waldorf at 49th and Park, and when we got there -- or rather, as close to there as the cops would let us -- we found ourselves penned in by metal barricades, unable to move. Confusion mounted among protesters who did not know why they were being immobilized, and a CIMC colleague rang my mobile phone from the back of the march (I had moved forward by this time, attempting to find out what was happening) to say that people were giving up and leaving. It turned out that 3 "pens" had been set up along the West side of Park Avenue, with the cross streets separating them. The march had been divided between these pens and protesters were not allowed to move from one to the other. We were packed too dense to move freely, and police were letting people out only at a small opening at the front, and only if they agreed to leave the site. After holding us this way for what seemed like at least an hour, the cops began allowing people through to the next pen in a small corridor. I wormed my way to the front of our pen to see two crowds of fenced-in protesters separated by a sea of helmeted police. The National Lawyers' Guild legal observer standing beside me began to explain that the heads of the legal team had all this time been negotiating with the police to allow protesters through. She went on to say that the reason the march had gone so slowly was that these negotiations had to occur at every intersection because the police had changed the parade route at the last minute. As people moved forward across 48th street, an AWIP "stage manager" made people aware that they were moving into another enclosed pen, and that the planned rally could not take place because the police had taken the sound equipment. We never made it into the third area closest to the Waldorf, despite that this was the space in which the rally was supposed to have been held. A friend told me that initially one section of the march had been in this area, but the police had told them they could leave and all but 8 people did. Stage managers began calling for an impromptu spokescouncil, and after a long stretch of dancing in place to the tireless samba band, the word came down that we were going to about-face and leave the area calmly as a united group. The 800-1000 people remaining at this point put their hands on one another's shoulders and moved slowly back toward 46th street in single-file lines. The police moved the fences toward the sidewalk so that we were now penned in a space about 10-15 feet wide between them and the barricaded sidewalk. As we waited what seemed like at least another hour to be let out, protesters sang, gave one another back rubs, and raised chants such as "This is illegal detention!" and "We all have to pee!" Rumors circulated that people were being allowed to leave one at a time, and that arrests were then being made a block away from the site (upon exiting we did find out from another IMC reporter that several more people had been arrested as they attempted to leave the protest). We finally made it to the front, and were allowed to exit in groups of ten. As we did so, a legal observer shouted not to block the sidewalks or we'd be arrested. Free at last, we proceeded out into what looked like a battlezone, with riot-outfitted police and blaring sirens all around us. Seemingly under orders to keep the protest away from the Waldorf Astoria for as long as possible, the police turned what was supposed to have been a peaceful demonstration against the World Economic Forum into a tense and at times violent stand-off between protesters and the NYPD. Never allowed to approach the object of the demonstration and held for hours inside police lines, the protesters nonetheless remained calm and attempted to sustain the carnival atmosphere that had inaugurated the march earlier in the day. The only interaction with police that I saw initiated by protesters were requests and chanted demands to be allowed to go to our planned and permitted rally site, and a few requests for information about why we were being held (made mostly by me and other press). All "contact-heavy" protester-police encounters I saw were unambiguously initiated by the police.

Law aims to plug leaks
By ANDREW PROBYN
WHISTLEBLOWERS who reveal politically embarrassing information could be jailed for two years under federal laws before Parliament.
Journalists or MPs who receive leaked information would risk seven years jail under the proposed laws if it related to defence or security.
The changes have been attacked as a blow to the public's right to know and as unwarranted protection for politicians from embarrassing revelations.
If the laws had existed last year, the public servant who leaked information on former defence minister Peter Reith's misuse of his Telecard could have been jailed.
So could the so-called deep throats who have exposed several MPs as travel Most of the Criminal Code Amendment (Espionage and Related Offences) Bill relates to strengthening penalties for spying that threatens national security and defence.
But section 82.3 of the Bill contains an unqualified clause with broader "A person commits an offence if the person communicates, or makes available, an official record of information, or official information," it The Bill also widens the definition of "official record of information" to include any information that someone is duty bound to keep secret.
Federal secretary of the journalists' union Christopher Warren said the Bill was worrying.
Mr Warren said the laws would stifle investigative journalism, even in situations involving public interest, by frightening would-be leakers.
"It's about increasing the secrecy of governmental operations," he said.
"The goal is to make it clear to public servants that while they might believe that blowing the whistle would be in the public interest, the personal consequences would be so great as to frighten them off."
Labor and the Australian Democrats said they would not support changes that removed protection for whistleblowers.
"Parliament is smart enough to legislate to strengthen national security while maintaining protection for whistleblowers who expose government corruption and mismanagement," Labor's home affairs spokesman, John Faulkner, said.
Democrats justice spokesman Brian Greig said: "One of the ways we keep the bastards honest is exposing the flaws of government and government Attorney-General Daryl Williams said the Bill was designed to get tough on spies and not infringe free speech.
He said he expected the legislation to be reintroduced to Parliament this

Anarcho-Punk Movie night a "smashing" success.
One of the most vital events in the city, the second free "punk movie night"
was a great example of anarchist counter-culture and politics strengthening
each other. Starting off was a great big meal of vegetable curry for a measly
$3. It was really great seeing the mix of people from young punk-rockers to
older politicos hanging out and enjoying themselves in the atmosphere of
comradely rebellion.
Soon, it was movie time and the night started off with "Train on the brain" a
documentary about train-hopping across the USA followed up by a cool super-
eight train-hopping short done by local adventurer Cam.
Next was "Global Dissent: Anarchist music and Action" which followed Scottish
anarcho-punk band Oi Polloi on one of their European tours. Highlights were a
stop at a squatted Glasgow community centre that was barricaded to keep the
cops out, a show in Eastern Europe that was attacked by fascists, and a
highway blockade.
Far and away the best film of the night was the recently released "Breaking
the spell" which documents the anti-WTO demonstrations in Seattle in 1999. A
lot of the demo footage can be seen on the "RIP WTO" video that was released
in '99 but there's also a good look into both the anarchist community of
Eugene Oregon and the intense media scrutiny they were under in the aftermath
of the WTO demo. What I really like about the film was the section that
talked about and showed the non-activist youth of Seattle fighting the police
in their neighborhood of capitol hill. Much derided by so-called "activists"
as "gang members who had nothing to do with the demonstrations" this video
shows the youth of Seattle representing for their neighborhood under police
attack or looting stores out of economic necessity. It was a well-executed
film that drew the connection between the activist demonstrations in the day
and the popular revolt of working-class youth at night.
The punk movie night is already so popular that it was hard to get a seat,
and if they keep up this dynamic mix of counter-cultural and political films
it will soon be standing room only. A truly outstanding event!

@_subject: Anarchs in NYC;"no demands." 
Anti-Capitalist Convergence - New York City
Some might find it strange that the ACC is not making any demands of the
politicians, bankers and CEOs gathering for the World Economic Forum in
New York.
What, precisely, are we protesting, then?
In fact, we not 'protesting' at all. The Anti-Capitalist Convergence is
a gathering of collectives, affinity groups, and individuals inspired by
the principle of direct action. Direct action means that if there are
problems in the world, one does not go appealing to the authorities to
solve them for us, one does not go begging - or even demanding - that
those in power stop doing things that create those problems. Because
those who believe in direct action do not recognize that authority, and
wish to put an end to that power. Direct action means taking action for
ourselves, either to create our own solutions - acting as if that power
does not exist - or, if we must confront our rulers, by putting our
bodies on the line to stop them from doing what they're doing. It is, at
the same time, a form of action and a form of education, because we are
acting in the world, but by doing so, we are also showing people
everywhere that there is an alternative to passive acquiescence - that
it is possible for communities to take power over their own lives, to
intervene in history, and to do it in a form which itself provides a
vision of the kind of world in which we would really like to live.
Therefore we are not even saying "we demand the right to live in freedom
and dignity", because freedom and dignity is not something our rulers
can ever grant us. It is their very existence, as rulers, that makes
freedom and dignity impossible.
All this is only possible if we refuse to live in fear. As anarchists,
we recognize that the power of our rulers can only be maintained by
terror; both governments and terrorists are ultimately playing the same
game: the manipulation of ordinary people's sense of fear and insecurity
for political gain. We, on the other hand, stand in absolute rejection
of any politics of terror. That is why we are taking action now, in New
York City, despite the obvious risks. The WEF's choice to relocate to
Manhattan is a blatant example of just this sort of cynicical
exploitation of grief, fear, and terror - they know they are bringing
disruption and probably violence into the lives of an already frightened
and traumatized population, but they hope to exploit those emotions to
make it easier for them to crush us. By standing up and taking action
anyway, despite all the police and military force and manipulation of
the press and public opinion we know are being marshalled against us, we
are sending a message to the world that it is not necessary to be ruled
by fear: we refuse to bow down to terror, just as we refuse to terrorize
anyone else.
What, then, do we want?
We are anarchists because we believe it would be possible to have a
society without rulers; one based on principles of self-organization,
voluntary association, and mutual aid. We believe that capitalism cannot
be reformed, and no system built on marshalling the powers of greed and
fear to drive people to organize their lives around the endless
production and accumulation of commodities, no society which measures
its success by the total amount of merchandise it manages produce, could
ever lead to human happiness - in fact, could ever lead to anything
other than a world in which even the most successful are mired in
loneliness and alienation and the vast majority of our fellow humans,
destroyed by terror and despair. We believe it is possible, instead, for
communities and individuals to take control over their own lives, and
create a new world in which the desire for the endless maximization of
profit could be replaced by a desire for the full self-realization of
human beings: a world in which everyone can have the security of knowing
their basic needs will be met, and therefore will be free to contribute
to society as they see fit, in sustainable harmony with the earth and
natural world; a world which would involve pleasures, challenges, and
forms of joy and fulfilment that at present we could hardly imagine.
And if that it is possible - (and can anyone say with certainty that it
is not?) - could there be anything more important than working to bring
that world in to being?
Therefore we ask nothing more of the junketeers in the Waldorf than we
would of anyone else. As individuals, they are of course invited to join
us in the pursuit of a better world; if they are willing to abandoning
their power and privilege we will be happy to treat them as equals.
Or, if they are not willing to do that yet, we can, perhaps, provide one
other suggestion. If those who have gathered to celebrate their wealth
and power at the Waldorf would really like to make a "gesture of
solidarity" with New Yorkers, as they claim, we can suggest one thing
they might do. These are after all the very same people who, in their
roles as the stockholders and directors in financial institutions, are
collecting vast amounts of money from New Yorkers each month in the form
of mortgage payments, credit card bills, car payments, student loans...
There's almost nobody here in the city who isn't forking over
significant amounts of money to someone at the World Economic Forum
every month. If they want to help us, we suggest that, rather than
employing us as bellhops, chauffeurs, and caterers, and throwing us some
quarters in tips, they stop extracting this money from us. That's why we
are calling not only for the cancellation of international debt, which
literally takes food out of the mouths of hungry children, but personal
debt as well. If you claim you want to help, stop taking our money!
Otherwise, stop pretending you are making a "gesture of solidarity."

Andersen Fairy Tale
Would you get McDonalds to advise you about healthy eating? Or BP to sing
the praises of free electricity from the sun? Well, Neo-Labour thought it
would be a good idea to ask accountancy firm Andersen to write a report on
the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) - the scheme where the nation's public
services are flogged off to the private sector, who then lease them back to
the taxpayer! Andersen said PFI was a great idea and would save money - but
forgot to mention that it would also make them lots - they've already made
millions thanks to 37 PFI schemes they've already got their sticky little
accountants' fingers in. This company is so dodgy that even the Tories took
them to court and banned them from any government contracts for 12 years.
This didn't put off Neo-Labour though. Before Blair's government came to
power, they were advised by Andersen about the windfall tax, capital gains
tax and advanced corporation tax and in the summer of 1996 more than 90
Labour MPs attended an Andersen seminar on 'how to be a minister'. Patricia
Hewitt, now Trade and Industry secretary, used to be head of research at
Andersen Consulting.
Since coming to power, Neo-Labour continued to follow Andersen advice on
how to flog off our remaining national assets like Air Traffic Control, the
London Underground, defence research labs, schools and hospitals. Andersen
has also given expert advice on Railtrack, the Jubilee Line Extension,
British Nuclear Fuels, education action zones, the management of local
education authorities as well as doing the accounts for the Millennium
Andersen are making the news at the moment for helping to cover up the
collapse of energy giant Enron - which last year entered the record books
by becoming the biggest company to go bankrupt in US corporate history. Not
only did Andersen receive $25 million for its Enron audit work, where you
would have expected to see that Enron's accounting was bullshit, but also
$27 million for its Enron consultancy work, which probably explains why
they turned a blind eye and also why one US Senator commented "If Enron
robbed the bank, Arthur Andersen drove the getaway car."
Lately Andersen have been busy shredding as many Enron documents as
possible - all in the interests of recycling and making more bedding for
hamsters of course.

Igariwey  -- the first book-length treatment of anarchism and Africa -- is
now online after being out-of-print for many years.
The authors, members of Nigeria's legendary Awareness League, argue that
anarchism provides a coherent framework with which to comprehend and
respond to the multiple crises afflicting the continent. "It is against
this background that we, members of the Awareness League, have elected to
trace the relationship between Africa and anarchism. In doing so, we are
impelled by a two-fold sense of historical responsibility: to enrich
anarchism and anarchist principles with an African perspective, and to
carve out a place for Africa within the framework of the worldwide
anarchist movement." ~ from the Introduction.

Friday, Jan 25. If anyone has doubts please call the FBI and re-confirm
The FBI/Anti-Terrorism Task Force did not issue a press release or hold a
press conference on the raid, therefore there has been no corporate media
coverage; i.e. the they are trying to keep it quiet. I wonder why?

to get his web site back up (see comments):
It doesn't mention the raisethefist name, but it could be relevant.
Federal agents  conducted a raid on a group of teenage
anti-globalization hackers.
The raid was carried out on 24 January in Los Angeles but confirmation by
the FBI
was only issued today. FBI agents entered the home of 18 year old Sherman
Martin Austin,
suspected of having posted anarchist messages and information on how to
build a bomb
on his website. Agents confiscated his computer and several documents.
Austin may be
charged with computer fraud and dissemination of bombmaking instructions.
The teenager, who
claims to be a member of an antiglobalization group, bitterly condemned the
use of firearms
by agents. "They surrounded my home with machine guns and shotguns while
wearing bulletproof
vests. They had more firepower than they typically use againt street gangs
or in drug busts."
Matthew McLaughlin, a spokesman for the FBI, confirmed that the agents
participating in
the raid were heavily armed. "We made sure they were protected. We don't
conduct raids

activist website was shutdown by the Los Angeles Anti-Terrorism Task
Force. On the afternoon of Jan. 24, 20 well-armed agents of the FBI,
Secret Service, and LAPD served a 25-page search warrant on the San
Fernando Valley residence of 18-year-old programmer/activist Sherman.
By the end of the evening, federal agents had driven off with the
entire home computer network that hosted and laanarchists.org
( -
including 8 computers and even the DSL modem.
Sherman, who prefers to use only his surname, 'had bomb-making
information on his website, which under the terms of the Patriot Act
is illegal,' FBI Spokesman Matthew McLaughlin told the LA Weekly,
which published a news report on Jan. 31
( Sherman,
however, was not arrested, and is now working on restoring his
websites from an old backup while he awaits further legal developments
The RTF raid was first reported late Jan. 24 on Indymedia, the network
of open-publishing news sites. It was confirmed the next day by
Indymedia volunteers in San Francisco, who spoke with Cheryl Mimura
from the Los Angeles FBI Field Office. Mimura described an ongoing
investigation into 'computer fraud and abuse' as well as 'distribution
of information related to explosives, destructive devices, and/or
weapons of mass destruction,' and confirmed that the site had been
'shutdown' -- but declined to provide Sherman's full name or any other
information, since no arrests had been made.
Over the weekend an interview with Sherman appeared on Kuro5hin
( in which he
denied that anything illegal was hosted on his servers, describing
himself as a victim of an FBI attempt 'to silence' his increasingly
popular, allbeit politically-'radical' websites. Sherman's take on
the episode rings true in light of comments by FBI agents that it was
the particularly 'militant,' anarchic content he hosted that
precipitated the investigation and raid.
Within days over a dozen reports were circulating on various e-mail
lists and websites. Mysteriously, however, no mainstream media had
picked up the story... Was this course of events perhaps all
according to plan? Given the absence of the usual FBI press conference
or press release after a successful anti-terrorism operation, and
possible first ammendment implications of the case, it does appear
that the FBI is hoping to keep a lid on the story.
Needless to say, all manner of treasonous banter, bomb recipes, and
worse are available on newsgroup archives (such as
 as well as current listserv and discussion
sites... One wonders which website(s) the FBI will target next.
The Los Angeles Anti-Terrorism Task Force was christened shortly after
the events of Sep. 11 (

together to oversee security for the 1984 Olympics. The now
nationwide Anti-Terrorism Task Forces enjoy greatly enhanced power and
prestige since the Patriot Act was signed into law on Oct. 26, 2001.

...I'm in Malta right now and not in a position to do long-distance research myself. Indymedia proponents have been telling me, correctly, in private email that they were the first site to
publish news of the raid. The problem is that anyone can post anything on
Indymedia, so an appearance on such a site by itself is not more credible
than a Usenet post or barroom gossip. Some threads are researched and
include legitimate news reporting; others are mere rants. Below "sf

The FBI has confirmed the raid but has not yet charged Sherman Austin,

Bangalore firm comes to CIA's aid
SOFIA TIPPOO
TIMES NEWS NETWORK [ WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 30, 2002  11:36:32 PM ]
ANGALORE: The world's most powerful secret service organisation -- the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) -- is dipping into the hi-tech expertise of a Bangalore company to give it more teeth.
Stratify, earlier known as Purple Yogi, is working for the CIA to sift through the mammoth of unstructured information streaming into the organisation from a myriad sources. Some sensational, some plain hogwash.
Interestingly, this project located on Bangalore's Airport Road has been funded by In-Q-Tel, an independent investing arm of the CIA.
``Working for the Intelligence Agency is a challenging task. The amount of information coming in is overwhelming -- there are so many e-mails, letters and sometimes just rumours sent in by their operatives across the length and breadth of the world that trying to make logical sense is excruciatingly painful,'' says Rakesh Mathur, who shot to fame when his start-up Junglee was sold to Amazon for a multi-million dollar sum.
Stratify has developed a software which endows a certain method to the maddening deluge of unstructured data that comes into the CIA network. ``In-Q-Tel is building a portfolio of highly innovative and important new commercial technologies that can help tackle the toughest IT challenges the CIA faces today,'' says Gilman Louie, In-Q-Tel President and CEO.
It's evident that post-September 11, a sense of acute urgency has crept into the functioning of US' premier intelligence agency. It's largely believed that a robust software such as this would be able to quickly sniff a logical pattern in secret e-mails that land in the CIA mailbox. It is felt that if the CIA obtains a certain coherence from the mass of information that comes its way, catastrophes like the 9/11 one could have been averted.
``It is just not humanly possible to find a way out of all this unstructured data. Our software ensures that it can be done and more important is the fact that it understands different languages -- including Farsi, Arabic, French, German and others,'' says Mathur.
Although the company has developed the software for CIA, it is still involved in the applications that go on top of it. One such application can be to get one page a day delivered to the US President. And, this one page comes maybe from tons of info that pours into the CIA office at Langley, Virginia and other centres.
And, it is just not cloak-and-dagger stuff that this software is being used for. India's most admired company, Infosys Technologies, is another one of its customers. ``For them, all the unstructured information is used for creating business proposals and specifications as fast as possible, beating competition,'' adds Nimesh Mehta, the newly joined CEO who was a former vice-president of the world's largest database company, Oracle.
The brains behind the project
How is Stratify planning to become ``an Oracle of unstructured data management''? The hardcore tech-team consists of: John Lamping who holds original patents for structured access algorithms. Joy Thomas, who was a senior engineer in IBM's Watson Research Lab, who has authored books on fundamental research. Pandu Nayak earlier worked in NASA where he did original untethered spacecraft. Two founders are from the Microprocessor Lab, Intel. And, Rakesh Mathur, of course.

The London Times
Violent Protesters Riot in New England
By the slave
Boston, Mass. (AustinIndymedia)  Last night, hordes of violent and unruly protesters snuck by British guards and managed to destroy untold amounts of East India Company tea. Protesters, hidden beneath intimidating Mohawk Indian disguises and under cover of night, were able to make their way onboard the ships to destroy stockpiles of tea.
These unruly protesters threw crate after crate of East India Company tea into the Boston Harbor. Scenes like this have marred much of the Commonwealth in New England since the passage of the Tea Act of 1773.
Lord North, a major proponent of the Tea Act, reacted to the property destruction of protesters today, saying, This Tea Act is good for the New England colonists. It will lower the price of tea and eliminate the middle-man. Lower prices will spread prosperity. These protesters have no understanding of economics.
We would like to dialogue with protesters but we cannot allow these protesters to break down all sense of law and order. These hooligans committing property damage and attacking Redcoats need to be dealt with. Protesters in the Colonies should more constructive things like write their representatives, he said.
Protesters may have little understanding of economics, but they have a lot of support from discontented radicals. Many of them argue that the Tea Act may lower prices but comes at a price. This tax cut is putting small tea retailers and merchants out of business and gives the East India Company a virtual monopoly on global tea supplies, said one protester today.
But officials inside the Commonwealth argue the tax-cut is an example of how the market can answer global needs. This tax relief will allow East India Company to be more competitive in a global market, said one trade analyst. More trade will mean more jobs for Commonwealth citizens in the long run.
Protest Tactics Startle Unprepared Law Officials
The Boston Tea Party, as protesters have started called it, has left many constabulary and law enforcement scrambling to catch-up. Redcoats guarding the harbors thought they were prepared, but when groups of clandestine protesters broke past their lines, it was apparent that protesters were more organized than originally thought.
We were literally caught with our pants down, said one official. We knew that there would be radicals out for trouble in the crowds. But we werent prepared for this kind of violent reaction. They literally overwhelmed us then started destroying private property.
No one is sure yet exactly how much damage has been done, but most calculate the figure is very high. Were still busy trying to figure out what got destroyed and what didnt, said a representative for the East India Company. Whats more frightening is that these protests are going to spread from one harbor to another.
And that is the kind of talk that keeps law enforcement up at night. What you have is a bunch of malcontents disguising themselves under Indian masks and using the cover of dark to destroy as much as they can, said one guard who was present at the riot.
For his part, Governor General Thomas Hutchinson promised he would bring law and order back to the Boston community. We understand that many protesters may have grievances with the Commonwealth, but these kinds of anarchic mob-rule actions are not doing their cause any good. Citizens have a right to feel safe and secure in their cities.
But groups like the Sons of Liberty have no intentions of stopping these rolling protests anytime soon. They vow to confront law enforcement officials and resist what they see as growing monopolistic power and democratic unaccountability.
One protest representative, a plain and sallow-looking man, Samuel Adams, claimed protesters would keep battling law enforcement in the streets. He criticized leaders as having gained the Confidence of their Country, are sacrilegiously employing their Talents to the Ruin of its Affairs, for their own private Emolument."
Officials claim they will stand up to this traveling troupe of troublemakers however. There are already plans in the Commonwealth Parliament to deploy four new regiments to protect harbors from more property destruction and rioting in the future. The Parliament has also said they will close down harbors entirely to protect them in the future if violence escalates.
At least one Redcoat offered his own opinion: They may talk about lofty ideas, but we arent going to let them plunge our cities or nation into chaos. These people pretend to have ideas but are really intent on creating mindless violence and property destruction. I have only one question for these protesters. Why dont you take off your masks?

EIGHT MONTHS ago police and secret agents lied to gain entry and stole my notebook.EIGHT MONTHS later Ive not even been questioned about what I'm supposed to have done.
The headlines from the herald scum,june 5,page 5.You would think the P.I.Gs had caught a serial killer like dennis Tanner or mark Read.EIGHT MONTHS after supposed death threats were placed at an "anarchist" website,"where anyone can post anything."(2 police quotes,under oath.)
NO CHARGES!
Not even an interview.Small wonder depressed police are wandering around taking bribes,this sort of incompetence is staggering.

Argentina;From the 1890,s an Anarchist movement,"among the largest and most influential in the
world,"(D.Rock.Cambridge University press.Politics in Argentina,1890-1930.)Significant propagandists Pedro Gori
and Dr Creaghe who founded La Protesta.Anarchists enjoyed solid support amongst dock workers,
shop mechanics,bricklayers,bakers and coachbuilders.Despite deportations and prison sentences
the anarchist movement grew to the extent that it created the major syndicalist movement,the
F.O.R.A.(Workers federation of the Argentine Region.)The rulers offered a terrible repression
and the bitter struggle may be seen in the film,"Patagonia Rebelde."
Following strikes in 1919 a police edict against,"all known anarchists,"led to a brutal spate
of mass arrests and deportations.
It is sometimes alleged the anarchists in Argentina employed ,"terrorist tactics,"The dual standard
of reporting that persists today is responsible for this.The workers were faced with the most terrible
repression.State violence was not correctly described as terrorist itself for being Govt. financed and directed
toward working class and vulnerable groups.The right is allowed murder gangs and the secret police
lend a hand yet any attempt to even the odds is regarded by the press as To look back on past heroic struggles and find invariably they were under libertarian banners
not authoritarian is inspiring for the future.Its clear that where workers have yielded to
middle class leadership that it has always proved authoritarian.Workers left to their own ideals
and principles come up with anarchist struggles and solutions,authoritarian ideas are always
imposed by outside intervention.The rise and fall of radicalism is not written by an anarchist
and has all the more credibility for that.Extracted and modified from an Albert Meltzer review
in the cienfuegos press anarchist review,1977.

libertarian != anarchist (4.11 / 9) ( (Scrolled down about a dozen to find this)
by doviende on Tue Feb 5th, 2002 at 03:34:17 PM EST
(pete AT linux HYPHEN geek DOT net) just to clear things up, the historical definition of anarchism (it being a philosophy dating back hundreds of years), is the belief that power and domination are harmful and unnecessary in society.
one consequence of this belief in the abolition of hierarchical authority is the abolition of government, but wanting to get rid of government is not a sufficient condition for being an anarchist. It is a necessary condition (but not sufficient).
Because of the hierarchical nature of capitalism, anarchists oppose that too, as well as racism, sexism, and homophobia.
since the libertarians don't have an analysis of authority in general, but merely oppose the State, they are not anarchists, but merely anti-government. Libertarians will freely admit that in many cases it's ok for one person to hold power over other people, as long as it's not "government" over them. In effect, with their private mercenary militia ideas (if you're rich enough, you hire your own army to hold your vast tracts of land), and their total control over whatever land area they claim to "own", they recreate a dictatorship on their own "property".
In the libertarian view, you don't seem to have any rights at all if you don't own some property. and if you "own" the property that a town is on, then you have the right to dictate what happens in that town.
So, i would say that it's quite clear that libertarians are not anarchists, because anarchism has always been about opposing ALL power and domination, not just "government", and libertarians only oppose government, not other kinds of power and authority (ie economic, social).
for more info about this view of "property", see here For more info on why libertarians are not anarchists, see here , and for more general anarchist stuff, see here.

Calif. Court Weakens 3-Strikes Law
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - In a serious blow to California's three-strikes law, a federal appeals court has ruled that life in prison for shoplifting is cruel and unusual punishment.
Thursday's decision by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (news - web sites) is expected to overturn the sentences of 340 people serving life terms for shoplifting. It also may spark appeals from inmates serving life for other nonviolent offenses in California, one of a number of states where ``three-strikes'' laws permit long sentences for criminals convicted of a third felony.
The California law is the harshest of those repeat offender statutes. It lets judges sentence defendants to 25 years-to-life for any felony conviction if they have already been convicted of two serious or violent felonies. A serious felony could include burglary of an unoccupied house or shoplifting.MORE...inc comment.

@_subject: Uptight texan Assholes analyze WSF,Brazil meet. 
Anti-Globalists Make a Play for Legitimacy
The latest World Social Forum indicates that the anti-
globalization movement is attempting to address two fundamental
weaknesses -- a lack of legitimacy and a lack of organization.
Though the disparate groups are unlikely to ever forge a unified
coalition that can challenge the global power brokers, pushing
their agenda through established, mainstream organizations like
the United Nations could allow them to affect policy on local and
national levels.
An anti-globalization group known as the International Forum on
Globalization (IFG) released several recommendations for
restructuring the global economy Feb. 2 at the World Social Forum
(WSF) in Porto Alegre, Brazil. The recommendations range from
limiting corporate power to folding a wide range of new
responsibilities and regulatory powers into the United Nations.
The substance of this and other proposals coming out of Porto
Alegre is less significant than the fact that the anti-
globalization movement is clearly seeking to move beyond its
radical, protest-driven roots to develop a concrete agenda. WSF
organizers and many of its participants are focused on bringing
the anti-globalization agenda into the mainstream. Part of this
strategy will include using more mainstream groups and
organizations, like the U.N., as a platform for their agenda.
The WSF -- which brings together a number of activist groups,
including the IFG -- will never operate from a position of global
power and therefore will not bring about major changes in global
policies and organizations. However, by working its agenda
through established organizations, the diverse members of the
anti-globalization movement may be able to gain more leverage at
the local and national level. At the same time, groups could find
themselves in unusual partnerships against a common enemy: the
United States.
The history of the anti-globalization movement -- which comprises
non-governmental organizations, leftist politicians, advocates
and protesters -- has actually worked against it. The movement is
still saddled with images of anarchists trashing Starbucks at the
1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle and agro-
protestors burning genetically modified corn in a Brazilian field
owned by Mansanto last year at the first WSF summit. The
prevailing view in many circles is that WSF participants are
largely angry contrarians and malcontents who lack serious
alternatives to the status quo, so they are disregarded.
WSF organizers and participants are now attempting to address two
fundamental weaknesses: a lack of legitimacy -- which is closely
tied to its public image problems -- and a lack of organization.
While media coverage of the 1999 WTO meeting and last year's WSF
summit focused primarily on the protests, most reports from Porto
Alegre this year point to a more substantive agenda, one full of
serious debate on issues and viable alternatives to the status
Headlines like "More Focus on Policy than Protest" from the
Associated Press and "Serious Ideas Behind the Theatrics" in the
Financial Times represent serious victories for the WSF. The
message now being delivered is that anti-globalists are not all
completely against "globalization" per se, but rather against
what they term "unfettered globalization" or "unrestrained
corporate power." Rather than dwelling on the unadulterated evils
of globalization, they talk of "progressive social reform."
"We say 'yes' to globalization, but with some limits," WSF
delegate Louise Beaudouin, the foreign minister of Quebec
province, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.
Some of those limits were outlined in the IFG report as well as
in a closing document adopted by the summit. Broadly, proposed
reforms centered around increasing aid to the developing world,
improving global governance, reining in corporate power and the
movement of capital and placing more protections on labor and the
environment. The United States and large multi-national
corporations remain the main antagonists.
In another bow to legitimacy, WSF organizers sought to diminish
the presence and influence of more radical elements. They shunned
anarchist groups and kept other figures at a distance -- such as
radical French farmer Jose Bove, who made his name by burning
down a McDonald's in France and led the burning of the Mansanto
field last year.
Certain attendees also added to the legitimacy of the WSF.
Several World Bank and U.N. officials attended, including U.N.
Human Rights High Commissioner Mary Robinson. The speaking
schedule was replete with Nobel Prize winners. Liberal
politicians were also out in force, including six junior
ministers and three presidential candidates from France and Luis
Inacio "Lula" da Silva, the leading leftist candidate in Brazil's
presidential race. Da Silva made several strong statements
condemning U.S. dominance in the Americas and opposing plans for
a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas.
Heavy-hitting attendees not only add credence to the forum but
also point toward future alliances that anti-globalists will use
to forward their agenda. Organizing the hundreds of disparate
groups into one umbrella organization is a nearly impossible
task. An alternative strategy -- which simultaneously addresses
issues of legitimacy and organization -- is to dovetail with
larger and more established organizations that share similar
views on specific issues.
The IFG report puts a good deal of emphasis on the United
Nations. Anti-globalists may look to the U.N., especially its
bureaucratic arm, as a platform to push issues ranging from
capital controls to environmental and labor protection. The U.N.
will probably never have greater authority than it currently
possesses over such issues, since that would require Security
Council approval and charter reform. But existing U.N.
commissions could press for greater recognition of the anti-
globalist agenda.
Working through the U.N. has another advantage. The anti-
globalist agenda is broadly opposed to excessive U.S. power.
Countries looking to irritate the United States or curtail its
influence can use WSF issues within the structure of the U.N. to
indirectly challenge Washington.
Other organizations that the WSF participants could look to are
the International Labor Organization and the World Health
Organization. There also is an overlap between many WSF
participants and a relatively new Commission on Globalization.
Several NGO leaders including Lori Wallach, director of Public
Citizen's Global Trade Watch and a leading movement figure, are
co-chairs in the commission along with such mainstream figures as
Mary Robinson, George Soros, Mikhail Gorbachev, former World Bank
Chief Economist Joseph Stiglitz and International Labor
Organization Director-General Juan Somavia.
The more closely WSF participants can associate themselves and
their causes with organizations like the Commission for
Globalization -- and with politicians who share their views on
specific issues -- the more legitimacy they gain and the more
buzz their issues receive.
And in the end, this is all about buzz. Anti-globalists are
unlikely to effect change on a global level. Rather, the groups
attending gatherings like the WSF seek to co-opt power and create
leverage they can use on local, regional and, at most, national
levels. The more their issues are talked about globally, the more
pressure they can put on the local centers of power and the more
effective they will be at altering the status quo in small and

@_subject: TERRORISM AGAINST BLACKS IN AMERIKKKA 
________________________________________________
BY ALI KHALID ABDULLAH
Since September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) and the
Pentagon we have heard much rhetoric aout "terrorists" attacks and presumed
attacks to come. Many who have claimed to be social activists,
revolutionaries, peace seekers, liberals, etc., have defended the
governments term of what is terrorism and have come "full force" claiming
"terrorism is terrorism." However, those same people seem to have lost their
voice when it comes to Black people being the victims of terrorist acts.
They seem to forget the abuses Blacks have suffered at the hands of the
United States government and white Amerikkka.
Black people in Amerikkka have suffered many acts of terrorism, such as:
- being shipped from Afrika to Amerikkka in slave ships;
- surviving over 400 yeras of genocidal oppression on Amerikkkan shores;
- human suffering caused by both terrorism and racial hatred;
- amputations, beatings, rapes, lynchings, and chattel slavery;
- the New York Draft riots of 1863;
- post-reconstruction terrorism by the Klu Klux Klan;
- the Tulsa Race Riots of 1921;
- government-sponsored Counter-Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO) of the 1960s;
- the bombing of Black churches and homes;
- contemporary state-sanctioned police murders and brutality of scores of
black men and wimmin;
- the trumping up, rounding up and locking up hundreds of thousands of young
black males and females;
- the dumpting of tonnes of heroin into Black communities in the 1970s and cocaine throughout the 1980s.
This is merely a short list of some of the terrorist acts committed against
Black people in Amerikkka but I am not hearing white Amerikkka effectively
denouncing these acts. Nor have I ever read or heard the Red Cross get on
national television and petition the country to send money in to the victims
of Black genocide. I have not heard or seen any relief efforts being
recommended to stop the importation of drugs into the Black community (that
isn't coming into our communities by Black owned planes and cargo ships.)
What I do hear, however, is a huge cry by whites who refuse to want to even
have this government publicly accept responsibility and denounce its role in
enslaving millions of people. Or to give reparations as the Jews and the
Japanese have received.
White Amerikkka has to face itself and speak the truth when it speaks of
terrorism, or terrorism cannot end. It cannot end when you have the pot
callling the kettle black.

Vancouver Wa. (AP) -Josh Gordons new face looks a lot like his old one, before a flesh-eating fungus ate away his eyes, nose, cheeks and the roof of his mouth.
Like a mask, the newly created prosthetic face he received earlier this month fits neatly over the hole. Silicone skin blends with Joshua's skin tone, eyebrows are made from his own hair and the glass eyes, from which he'll never see, match the brown hue of the originals.
"The first thing we did after I got my new face was go to a public restaurant and have a steak dinner," said Josh who had avoided going out because of his disfiguration. "I felt wonderful; I felt pretty."
Josh wears rose-tinted shades to take attention away from the mask's unblinking eyes,"Id like to thank the doctors and my father who works nights as a carny to pay them"he stammers out through great choking sobs.
He that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself. - --Thomas Paine

@_subject: Anarchist Q+A,Direct Democracy. 
ANARCHIST QUESTION AND ANSWER Q. What is Direct Democracy? A. Anarchists are fond of using the term direct democracy to describe decision-making processes within an anarchist community. In its simplest form it means that the people who are affected by a decision, make that decision. Direct Democracy is a process that is not just used by anarchists. The difference between an anarchist community and any other community is based on the principles of association (constitution) that bind that community together. An anarchist community is based on two principles of association, equal access to power and wealth. Direct Democratic principles can be applied in societies with different principles of association to an anarchist community. People who live in a society based on Direct Democratic principles make decisions about their lives. They don¹t give a representative power to make decisions for them. Once they have made a particular decision they elect or appoint delegates to co-ordinate that decision with other communities that have made decisions about the same issue. The delegates enter into discussions with other delegates and come up with a compromise decision based on the decision that they have carried to the meeting. They do not have the authority of the group they are acting as delegates for, to accept this compromise decision. They need to take this decision back to the group they are acting as delegates for, for ratification. Although the process may at first seem cumbersome, its strength lies in peoples¹ participation in the decision-making processes. Once a decision is made, the community would throw their support behind the decision they have made. The differences between representative and direct democracy, are as marked as the difference between night and day. Direct democracy tends to incorporate, not alienate people from the political process. The greater the level of participation in the decision making process, the more likely any decision made is carried out. Direct democracy increases interest in the communities¹ affairs, because the people involved in that decision, know that ultimately they will be making that decision.
