@_subject: Re: No data retention in germany for donated services 
This is great news for all Tornode operators in Germany, if it comes true
in the meaning of the local (german) jurisdiction has to accept this.
It saves German operators from having to chose between breaking anonymity
by loggging data or being criminalyzed, or art least heavily fined or
punished otherwise.
It also would save quite a lot of work and money to be spent for saving all the data. This would be, presuming it to become accepted, excellent.
Unfortunatelly it does not solve the problem, the mere fact traffic is
going to be logged and held for 6 months is the problem, not who does
the actual logging. So the necessary data will be easily obtained on request of executives from the isp's where nodes are hosted/running.
But it may keep up the number of nodes in that country.
