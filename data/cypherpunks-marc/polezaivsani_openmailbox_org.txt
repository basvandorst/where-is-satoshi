[2016-08-28 00:34] Jelena Jovanovic Now i'm not aware of the person's real intents and certainly won't
dismiss the possibility of them being genuinely benign. But his
background makes me skeptical to the point of assuming the worst.
When a person used to hijacking software says he want to help
building better version of anti-censorship privacy concious system,
i'd need more than his word to trust him. Seems like a well-reasoned
judgement, don't you think?

[2017-05-17 01:33] grarpamp Hmmm, and why is that only one particular article off of issue misses a link to the paper? Guess nobody likes city-wide imsi-catcher
detection for some reason, huh. Not much more do search engines
seems to know about it.

[2017-05-07 16:31] Mirimir Nah, they are of the same 'sharing economy' bunch. Might do good
for a while, but it's the same dirty business after they get big
enough of a following.
Such issues can be addressed by the protocol. I would be cautious
about it though as it implies some sort of global consent on the
subject and anything global is a) technically involved and b) of
dubious social merits.
As a half-way alternative, it might be a system of opt-in policies
where some property gets enforced amongst participants. That's just
my speculation though.

[2017-05-06 20:21] "Shawn K. Quinn" I bet on classical p2p systems. These have quite some road to walk
and definitely need all the help you can give.
Humans being humans, this ain't a magic pill, though the core
principles leave much less for them to slide back into a usual
p.s. Not a taxi you where looking for, though should you be into
selling/buying stuff - why not give OpenBazaar a try? This one seems
to be pretty usable and with no central authority.

[2017-08-01 23:52 -0400] grarpamp Is there really a mechanism in BCC that enforces this?
Miners would need to interop with other chains in order to check
for cross chain double spends of pre-fork outputs. Yet the communication
between BCC and BTC seems unlikely given current state of affairs.
