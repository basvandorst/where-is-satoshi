I think you've got it backwards. See if he's actively like this in person.
Email ... "changes things" with communication.

Except of course when you're "asked" not to share what has occured with
anyone. I hear that kind of thing happens today.

I think history can conclusively state we're much, much better at eliminating
people then we are hacked boxes; that politicians seem much happier somehow
about the former than the latter; and our collective "clue" at being able to
do so is growing much faster than our electronic toolkits. :-)
(Oh god. :-)

And does this interference similarly screw up being able to RX data from
the transponder whilst in Europe?
(eg, if you stick a modem on RX-only in Europe (ie, no uplink) and then
just lock onto the signal and decode whatever happens, do you suffer
the same problem?)

Can you get access to some kind of spectrum analyser kit to see what the
kind of interference is?
