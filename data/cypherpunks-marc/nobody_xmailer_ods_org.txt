Police warn of arrests over masks during WEF protests
January 28, 2002, 12:50 PM EST
NEW YORK -- Bracing for large-scale protests at the
World Economic Forum, the NYPD drew a line in the
sand Monday over an obscure law barring
demonstrators from wearing masks. Chief of Patrol Joseph Esposito told a news conference
that the department would strictly enforce the code,
which prohibits three or more protesters from wearing
masks. "Three or more with masks and they're marching,
they're under arrests," Esposito said. Got Osama?  Didn't think so..

Anthrax Missing From Army Lab
                            January 20, 2002
                            By JACK DOLAN And DAVE ALTIMARI,                             Courant Staff Writers
                            Lab specimens of anthrax spores, Ebola virus and                             other pathogens disappeared from the Army's                             biological warfare research facility in the early                             1990s, during a turbulent period of labor complaints                             and recriminations among rival scientists there,                             documents from an internal Army inquiry show.
                            The 1992 inquiry also found evidence that someone                             was secretly entering a lab late at night to conduct                             unauthorized research, apparently involving anthrax.                             A numerical counter on a piece of lab equipment had                             been rolled back to hide work done by the mystery                             researcher, who left the misspelled label "antrax" in                             the machine's electronic memory, according to the                             documents obtained by The Courant.
                            Experts disagree on whether the lost specimens pose                             a danger. An Army spokesperson said they do not                             because they would have been effectively killed by                             chemicals in preparation for microscopic study. A                             prominent molecular biologist said, however, that                             resilient anthrax spores could possibly be retrieved                             from a treated specimen.
                            In addition, a scientist who once worked at the                             Army facility said that because of poor inventory                             controls, it is possible some of the specimens                             disappeared while still viable, before being treated.
                            Not in dispute is what the incidents say about                             disorganization and lack of security in some quarters                             of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of                             Infectious Diseases - known as USAMRIID - at                             Fort Detrick, Md., in the 1990s. Fort Detrick is                             believed to be the original source of the Ames strain                             of anthrax used in the mail attacks last fall, and                             investigators have questioned people there and at a                             handful of other government labs and contractors.
                            It is unclear whether Ames was among the strains of                             anthrax in the 27 sets of specimens reported missing                             at Fort Detrick after an inventory in 1992. The Army                             spokesperson, Caree Vander-Linden, said that at                             least some of the lost anthrax was not Ames. But a                             former lab technician who worked with some of the                             anthrax that was later reported missing said all he                             ever handled was the Ames strain.
                            Meanwhile, one of the 27 sets of specimens has                             been found and is still in the lab; an Army                             spokesperson said it may have been in use when the                             inventory was taken. The fate of the rest, some                             containing samples no larger than a pencil point,                             remains unclear. In addition to anthrax and Ebola,                             the specimens included hanta virus, simian AIDS                             virus and two that were labeled "unknown" - an                             Army euphemism for classified research whose                             subject was secret.
                            A former commander of the lab said in an interview                             he did not believe any of the missing specimens were                             ever found. Vander-Linden said last week that in                             addition to the one complete specimen set, some                             samples from several others were later located, but                             she could not provide a fuller accounting because of                             incomplete records regarding the disposal of                             specimens.
                            "In January of 2002, it's hard to say how many of                             those were missing in February of 1991," said                             Vander-Linden, adding that it's likely some were                             simply thrown out with the trash.
                            Discoveries of lost specimens and unauthorized                             research coincided with an Army inquiry into                             allegations of "improper conduct" at Fort Detrick's                             experimental pathology branch in 1992. The inquiry                             did not substantiate the specific charges of                             mismanagement by a handful of officers.
                            But a review of hundreds of pages of interview                             transcripts, signed statements and internal memos                             related to the inquiry portrays a climate charged with                             bitter personal rivalries over credit for research, as                             well as allegations of sexual and ethnic harassment.                             The recriminations and unhappiness ultimately                             became a factor in the departures of at least five                             frustrated Fort Detrick scientists.
                            In interviews with The Courant last month, two of                             the former scientists said that as recently as 1997,                             when they left, controls at Fort Detrick were so lax it                             wouldn't have been hard for someone with security                             clearance for its handful of labs to smuggle out                             biological specimens.
                            Lost Samples
                            The 27 specimens were reported missing in                             February 1992, after a new officer, Lt. Col. Michael                             Langford, took command of what was viewed by                             Fort Detrick brass as a dysfunctional pathology lab.                             Langford, who no longer works at Fort Detrick, said                             he ordered an inventory after he recognized there                             was "little or no organization" and "little or no                             accountability" in the lab.
                            "I knew we had to basically tighten up what I                             thought was a very lax and unorganized system," he                             said in an interview last week.
                            A factor in Langford's decision to order an inventory                             was his suspicion - never proven - that someone in                             the lab had been tampering with records of                             specimens to conceal unauthorized research. As he                             explained later to Army investigators, he asked a lab                             technician, Charles Brown, to "make a list of                             everything that was missing."
                            "It turned out that there was quite a bit of stuff that                             was unaccounted for, which only verifies that there                             needs to be some kind of accountability down                             there," Langford told investigators, according to a                             transcript of his April 1992 interview.
                            Brown - whose inventory was limited to specimens                             logged into the lab during the 1991 calendar year -                             detailed his findings in a two-page memo to                             Langford, in which he lamented the loss of the items                             "due to their immediate and future value to the                             pathology division and USAMRIID."
                            Many of the specimens were tiny samples of tissue                             taken from the dead bodies of lab animals infected                             with deadly diseases during vaccine research.                             Standard procedure for the pathology lab would be                             to soak the samples in a formaldehyde-like fixative                             and embed them in a hard resin or paraffin, in                             preparation for study under an electron microscope.
                            Some samples, particularly viruses, are also                             irradiated with gamma rays before they are handled                             by the pathology lab.
                            Whether all of the lost samples went through this                             treatment process is unclear. Vander-Linden said the                             samples had to have been rendered inert if they were                             being worked on in the pathology lab.
                            But Dr. Ayaad Assaad, a former Fort Detrick                             scientist who had extensive dealings with the lab,                             said that because some samples were received at the                             lab while still alive - with the expectation they would                             be treated before being worked on - it is possible                             some became missing before treatment. A phony                             "log slip" could then have been entered into the lab                             computer, making it appear they had been                             processed and logged.
                            In fact, Army investigators appear to have wondered                             if some of the anthrax specimens reported missing                             had ever really been logged in. When an investigator                             produced a log slip and asked Langford if "these                             exist or [are they] just made up on a data entry                             form," Langford replied that he didn't know.
                            Assuming a specimen was chemically treated and                             embedded for microscopic study, Vander-Linden                             and several scientists interviewed said it would be                             impossible to recover a viable pathogen from them.                             Brown, who did the inventory for Langford and has                             since left Fort Detrick, said in an interview that the                             specimens he worked on in the lab "were completely                             inert."
                            "You could spread them on a sandwich," he said.
                            But Dr. Barbara Hatch Rosenberg, a molecular                             biologist at the State University of New York who is                             investigating the recent anthrax attacks for the                             Federation of American Scientists, said she would                             not rule out the possibility that anthrax in spore form                             could survive the chemical-fixative process.
                            "You'd have to grind it up and hope that some of the                             spores survived," Rosenberg said. "It would be a                             mess.
                            "It seems to me that it would be an unnecessarily                             difficult task. Anybody who had access to those labs                             could probably get something more useful."
                            Rosenberg's analysis of the anthrax attacks, which                             has been widely reported, concludes that the culprit                             is probably a government insider, possibly someone                             from Fort Detrick. The Army facility manufactured                             anthrax before biological weapons were banned in                             1969, and it has experimented with the Ames strain                             for defensive research since the early 1980s.
                            Vander-Linden said that one of the two sets of                             anthrax specimens listed as missing at Fort Detrick                             was the Vollum strain, which was used in the early                             days of the U.S. biological weapons program. It was                             not clear what the type of anthrax in the other                             missing specimen was.
                            Eric Oldenberg, a soldier and pathology lab                             technician who left Fort Detrick and is now a police                             detective in Phoenix, said in an interview that Ames                             was the only anthrax strain he worked with in the                             lab.
                            Late-Night Research
                            More troubling to Langford than the missing                             specimens was what investigators called                             "surreptitious" work being done in the pathology lab                             late at night and on weekends.
                            Dr. Mary Beth Downs told investigators that she had                             come to work several times in January and February                             of 1992 to find that someone had been in the lab at                             odd hours, clumsily using the sophisticated electron                             microscope to conduct some kind of off-the-books                             research.
                            After one weekend in February, Downs discovered                             that someone had been in the lab using the                             microscope to take photos of slides, and apparently                             had forgotten to reset a feature on the microscope                             that imprints each photo with a label. After taking a                             few pictures of her own slides that morning, Downs                             was surprised to see "Antrax 005" emblazoned on                             her negatives.
                            Downs also noted that an automatic counter on the                             camera, like an odometer on a car, had been rolled                             back to hide the fact that pictures had been taken                             over the weekend. She wrote of her findings in a                             memo to Langford, noting that whoever was using                             the microscope was "either in a big hurry or didn't                             know what they were doing."
                            It is unclear if the Army ever got to the bottom of the                             incident, and some lab insiders believed concerns                             about it were overblown. Brown said many Army                             officers did not understand the scientific process,                             which he said doesn't always follow a 9-to-5                             schedule.
                            "People all over the base knew that they could come                             in at anytime and get on the microscope," Brown                             said. "If you had security clearance, the guard isn't                             going to ask you if you are qualified to use the                             equipment. I'm sure people used it often without our                             knowledge."
                            Documents from the inquiry show that one                             unauthorized person who was observed entering the                             lab building at night was Langford's predecessor, Lt.                             Col. Philip Zack, who at the time no longer worked                             at Fort Detrick. A surveillance camera recorded                             Zack being let in at 8:40 p.m. on Jan. 23, 1992,                             apparently by Dr. Marian Rippy, a lab pathologist                             and close friend of Zack's, according to a report                             filed by a security guard.
                            Zack could not be reached for comment. In an                             interview this week, Rippy said that she doesn't                             remember letting Zack in, but that he occasionally                             stopped by after he was transferred off the base.
                            "After he left, he had no [authorized] access to the                             building. Other people let him in," she said. "He                             knew a lot of people there and he was still part of                             the military. I can tell you, there was no suspicious                             stuff going on there with specimens."
                            Zack left Fort Detrick in December 1991, after a                             controversy over allegations of unprofessional                             behavior by Zack, Rippy, Brown and others who                             worked in the pathology division. They had formed a                             clique that was accused of harassing the                             Egyptian-born Assaad, who later sued the Army,                             claiming discrimination.
                            Assaad said he had believed the harassment was                             behind him until last October, until after the Sept. 11                             terrorist attacks.
                            He said that is when the FBI contacted him, saying                             someone had mailed an anonymous letter - a few                             days before the existence of anthrax-laced mail                             became known - naming Assaad as a potential                             bioterrorist. FBI agents decided the note was a hoax                             after interviewing Assaad.
                            But Assaad said he believes the note's timing makes                             the author a suspect in the anthrax attacks, and he is                             convinced that details of his work contained in the                             letter mean the author must be a former Fort Detrick                             colleague.
                            Brown said that he doesn't know who sent the letter,                             but that Assaad's nationality and expertise in                             biological agents made him an obvious subject of                             concern after Sept. 11.

Way to go, Steve !
I always wanted to buy hundreds of non-expensive groucho sets and give them away on various occasions - any clues who sells them in quantity, and is the license required ?

The rest of reply is dumb and irrelevant.
The only question is: how many registered terrorist organisations have "terrorist" or "combat" in the name that they use when ordering teddy bears and laptops ?
The only reason not to order from Dell is staggering and probably contagious stupidity.
I wonder if INS flags "osama" during passport check ...
Sooner or later some words will become extinct. How many people with last name "Hitler" live today ?
