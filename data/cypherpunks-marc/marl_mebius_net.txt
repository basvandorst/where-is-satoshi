John uses Borland compiler as I can see from his previous posts. Borland
compiler support namespaces but xercesc does not know about this because
BorlandCDefs.hpp does not contain following define:
 XERCES_HAS_CPP_NAMESPACE
So John can add this define to
and rebuild xercesc library or don't include MSXML header files
