I know nothing about TrueCrypt, but I imagine a technical solution to
this kind of problem exists: Just give TrueCrypt the ability to have a
virtually unlimited number of hidden volumes. Now you can reveal them,
one after the other, in increasing order of embarrasment value and
perhaps a modest level of illegality, after which you say, that's it,
there are no more secrets here.

The raspberry pi supposedly has a hardware RNG built in.
Perhaps one could be used as a random data "dongle"?
It's not like they're super expensive.
