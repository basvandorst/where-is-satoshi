Originally, veins near Clarence's brain were doing much of the circulation work for both boys, but scans showed dormant veins on Carl's side had "plumped up" and begun working in response to the surgery, lead surgeon Dr. James Goodrich said last week.Arlene Aguirre and her mother, Evelyn Aguirre, were at the hospital throughout the operation, getting occasional updates from the!
