I hear a lot of replies saying that the guy is trying to protect himself and by law, should not have to provide a key to further incriminate himself. In all actuality, this guy is burying himself deeper by the day. Eventually, he will have to provide the key. If he doesn't, the witnesses that saw the naughty bits on his computer will most-likely be enough to put him away as well as the charge of obstruction of justice for not providing the key. Yes it is true, he was already caught. However, not cooperating is just going to prolong his sentence. If the defendant cooperates, he will be less likely to get the maximum. But what is really going on is that he probably has a whole lot worse on his computer than what was seen when he was arrested. So when he doesn't provide a key and makes everything worse in that aspect, it will be even more devastating to his life when the court does get into his files and sees the other stuff they didn't already know about. In my opinion, this gu
 y is fighting a losing battle against a monster that is 1000 times bigger than he could ever imagine. No matter what the law is, the government does what it wants. For instance, the patriot act.
