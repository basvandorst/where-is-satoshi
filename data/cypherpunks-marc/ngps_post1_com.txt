@_subject: Re: Compiling Mixmaster 2.9 beta under FreeBSD 
The OpenSSL bundled with FreeBSD is installed in /usr.
The simplest way to get a different OpenSSL (with IDEA, RC5, etc.) is to
build from source and install into /usr/local. Then, when configuring
Mixmaster or whatever software, specify that OpenSSL lives in /usr/local.
I last built Mix when it was still using rsaref, but I've used the above
method to build any number of OpenSSL-using software, including my own
M2Crypto. No need to remake the world.
