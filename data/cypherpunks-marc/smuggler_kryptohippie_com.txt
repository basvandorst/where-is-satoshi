Hash: SHA1
I think it is missleading to talk about "connectionless" here, it is
"stateless". There is a relationship between sender and recipient as is
for TCP, however the state and handshake are missing.
UDP can be observed just as well as TCP unless you go for an extra mile
by using random source/destination ports which however still leaves the
sender/recipient relationship. Which however you could break by
falsifying the sender address...... getting some bad thoughts here.
