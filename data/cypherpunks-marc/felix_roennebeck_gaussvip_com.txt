because this application was used to commit a bad crime - child pornography.
They don't. They care about a system that is located in Germany and that is used to commit a crime. Any other country would do that - especially the US..
I doubt that. Do you have any precise example ? I do:
- 5 big european airlines had to open theyr booking systems to US customs. They are able to see any data in that system - even information about for example bank accounts and even if they have never been to the US.
- Britain and the US are runnung a System called Echelon that is trying to listen to _any_ communication on the continent
This are two example for systems beeing trojanized. And I can't remeber a US representative saying "Hey, European citizens: Be careful where you fly and who you call. We are watching you."
And I think there are hundreds of more examples that allow to finger-point in one direction or the other. Every country tries to take care of its interests - and that is not allways nice to watch.
I don't think that the judge thought about that. But who knows ?
I would be _very_ careful with statements like this. We had this superior thing in the 1930/40s and I think we are pretty much over it.
