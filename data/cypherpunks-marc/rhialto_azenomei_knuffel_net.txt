Is this really the text? Either I read this wrong, or the text is
incredibly wrong in expressing its apparent intention.
What I read is that *copyright owner* is being restricted here, and not
a "user".
How: the measure prevents, restricts or limits ((the exercise of) a
right of) a copyright owner)...
So either I can't read (which I don't believe), the lawmakers cannot
write (I am more inclined to believe that), or the rules of language in
laws is different (that is true no matter what, in my experience).
