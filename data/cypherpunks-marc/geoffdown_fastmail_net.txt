I get by with allowing mail.google.com and accounts.google.com cookies
to log in to webmail. Although some .google.com cookies are also stored,
they are not sent when accessing google.com or  They
*are* sent when accessing mail.google.com again (or at least one of them
is, not sure why just the one).

@_subject: Re: [tor-talk] Tor -> VPN Clarification 
Yes, as long as the Tor *client* (Torbrowser) is running locally, the
connection *to* the Tor network is encrypted with Tor's encryption and
from that point of view it makes no difference if that connection is
direct or via a VPN ( VPN > Tor).
 If you run Tor > VPN, the connection *out of* the tor network is only
 encrypted with the VPN encryption and so vulnerable to sniffing by the
 VPN provider or a theoretical cracker of their encryption: if the
 traffic or the provider can identify you, you've lost anonymity with
 respect to the final destination.
 The worst case is if the Tor *client* is run remotely and you connected
 a normal browser to it via a VPN. Then you are entirely at the mercy of
 the VPN provider and their encryption from the point of view of
 deniability should you be investigated for some reason.
