Bin Laden was originally sponsored by Pakistan (Hence the

The Taliban was a creation of Pakistan, created well after
the Soviet Union fell, and sponsored by them until a few days

the US.

Terrorism is a good pretext for taking away our rights.
A war to destroy terrorist regimes is a less good pretext, and if it succeeds, will remove one pretext.   The end of the war will also spark a demand for a return to normality, similar to the anti socialist wave we saw in many english speaking countries at the end of World War II.  Socialism, introduced under the pretext of war, was discredited by its association with the privation and authoritarianism of war.
What George Bush is promising, truthfully or untruthfully, is just such a war.  A war where the good guys storm into the bad guy's presidential palace, and then come home to a victory parade, where upon everything returns to normal.
All wars are bad for freedom, but the war that George Bush promises is far less bad for freedom than unending terrorism.
Of course the previous Bush promised "read my lips, no new
taxes."     --digsig

No one believes legislation, least of all those who write them.  Everyone believes Webster's dictionary.
If the legislators believed that, why would they authorize the president to make war on a country to be determined in
order to punish it for terrorism?
The word terrorism is most commonly applied to the acts of governments, for example "the great terror", "the red terror".  Terrorism is a public good, thus only governments can efficiently supply terrorism.   The use of the word for non government actions is a response to events in the middle east.

If your lawyer advises you to plead guilty without a plea bargain

something with a small maximum penalty, that advice is so bad as
suggest some conflict of interest or impropriety on the part of
lawyer giving the advice.  One would expect such advice from a
court appointed lawyer who is taking his orders from the
prosecution.  Even if you are guilty as hell and they will have
no difficulty proving it, you can bargain something out of them
by threatening to put them to the trouble of actually proving it.
Even if what Isabella Dixon says was true, it would still be a

Bin Laden hates freedom, the freedom which leads to the US

You might have a point if some of the terrorists actually had been brutalized -- if for example some of them were palestinians that had been roughed up by Israeli soldiers.
They were not.
This was not an attack on America for any specific things the American government has done -- it is an an attack on Americans for being being free and rich, while arabs have inflicted slavery and poverty on themselves, an attack on Amercans for being American.
When two hundred US soldiers were blown up for meddling in  Lebanon, the US government go out of Lebanon.  The US public is not going to stop being American, and will kill as many arabs as is needed to ensure that they are allowed to be the people that they are.  If modest violence suffices, modest violence will be used.  If modest violence does not suffice, the process will continue till no arabs remain.      --digsig

The original vaccine was based on cowpox, the nearest relative of small pox.  However it was insufficiently effective and reliable, and so was furtively replaced by a weakened strain of smallpox, which was grown on cows.  The sellers of the vaccine continued to represent it as cowpox, but it was in fact a mild variant of the real thing, One reason for ending routine smallpox vaccinations was fear
that the vaccine might re-evolve virulence.     --digsig

You do not need to live in a slum.
Indeed most slums are poorly sealed, and most poorly sealed
buildings have no mold problem.
If you live in a well sealed building, and are energy
conscious, and always keep the doors and windows closed, and
the weather outside is cold, there will be chronic
condensation on windows and and some parts of the walls.
Mold will then grow, very possibly harming or even killing
the inhabitants.
The recent attack of the killer mold in California is a
result of the recent big energy conservation measures.
The correct response is to wipe down the highly visible mold
with dilute bleach solution, then leave a window cracked open

@_subject: Weaponizing anthrax 
The following is theory, constructed from readily available
public sources.  This theory has not been tested in practice.
Anthrax spores disperse in neutral water and most nutrient
broths, settling to the bottom so slowly that for all
practical purposes they do not settle.  To separate them one
would need to add a suitable agent to the solution --
probably acetic acid would do it.  Acidify the water to PH 4
or so, and let them settle out.  I do not know if this would
harm the spores, but spores are tough.
Take some sodium bentonite clay, let it swell in water to
maximum volume, and add water till it is nice and liquid.
The clay should be moderately alkaline.  Because the clay is
alkaline,  the spores will disperse in it, as they do in
clean water.  Mix spores very thoroughly into the clay.
Acidify the mixture with acetic acid till the PH ensures the
clay precipitates from the slurry  The clay should
precipitate out to form a crumbly precipitate which when
dried can be readily pulverized to very fine dust.  Different
clays will yield precipitates that have different physical
properties.  Have no idea what PH would ensure the best
properties of the precipitate, but one can test this without
any need for bacteria.
Now comes the tricky bit.  One could have a well equipped
laboratory to grind the precipitate without exposing oneself
to too much of the dust, or one could take several people
from some unwanted group, for example Tajiks or Kurds, put
the precipitate in a barrel containing granite rocks, and
have them roll the barrel around until the precipitate is
well powdered.
It seems to me that it is not very difficult to produce
weaponized anthrax with primitive means, except that such
means would liberally spread anthrax spores around the plant.
If the plant was located in the frozen wastes of afghanistan,
this would not be a serious problem.

When someone says that Stalin was not a communist, we know that person condemns Stalin for insufficient mass murder, and being too soft on the kulaks.
It is clear that Stalin was a sincere Marxist and a good Marxist theoretician.  He wrote some very clear theoretical explanations of Marxism, and he obviously viewed the world through that skewed and distorted lens.  He explained the core of his delusions most lucidly, and acted in accord with those delusions.  When Chomsky justified terror and slavery in North Vietnam, he used the language and theory of Stalin to justify it.  If Stalin was such a crappy theoretician, why is Chomsky using Stalinist theory?
The argument that Stalin was not a genuine Marxist was made at the time by those who thought themselves purer Marxists than he, who thought he was too soft on the kulaks, too bothered by foolish bourgeois morality, too reluctant to murder workers and peasants, and that Lenin was not communist Those who condemned Stalin for not being a sufficiently pure Marxist in 1930 were upset because in 1930 he backed off from mass murder and war upon the peasants -- though it eventually became apparent that he only backed off because the Soviet State was insufficiently prepared for that war, and might have lost it had it launched it prematurely.98

Anarcho capitalism corresponds to what any normal person
would call anarchy -- see for example my web page "Brief
explanation of anarcho capitalism"
Explanations of "anarcho" socialism are evasive, euphemistic
and full of equivocations.  When they go into detail, for
example par-econ, they describe in pleasant sounding words a
system more centralized and authoritarian in form and theory
than Stalin's was in form and theory, and often more
centralized and authoritarian even in theory than Maoism was
in actual practice.
If we go back to before 1936 there were various unclear,
confused, self contradictory, but undeniably sincere
proposals as to how to implement anarcho socialism.  Then
disaster struck. They actually had a go at it, with entirely
predictable results.  The contradiction between socialism and
anarchism was demonstrated with the usual rivers of blood.
Some became disillusioned.  Some reinterpreted their now
inconvenient past positions as standard socialism.     --digsig

The primary job that the military is trained for is to kill
enemies in war time.  Soldiers are trained not to worry about
collateral damage, not to worry too much if civilians happen
to be in the way, and they are trained to shoot first, think
later, and forget about asking questions.
If soldiers are used for law enforcement purposes, they have
habits that make them bad law enforcement officers and will
develop habits that will make them bad soldiers.
In guerrila wars, where the enemy is hidden and intermingled
with civilians, there is often substantial overlap between
military and police functions.  However, such wars have never
been won by the military alone, unless they adopted scorched
earth policies and drained the river to catch the fish.
Always, to win a guerrila war they needed a local militia who
knew the local people, needed a local militia to perform the
policing functions for them, to perform functions soldiers
are not trained to perform.
Soldier's are not only too dangerous to be cops, they are
also incompetent as cops.     --digsig

Kerrey (Democrat Party) can claim, implausibly, that he was

Let us imagine the following scenario.  You are going to
board a plane.   Someone who is known to be, or plausibly
alleged to be, a supporter of the terrorist movements the US
is currently at war with, also wants to board the same plane.
In that situation, your views on their right to travel by
plane will probably undergo a sudden change.
The enemies of freedom, which this woman certainly is, see
freedom as weakness and fear, and use it against us.  This
creates the danger that they succeed in making us give up
freedom, as has perhaps happened in this case, but it is not
merely a matter of dumb fucks using terrorism to institute a
police state.  There is a real threat here, which has to be
met with real violence.
Analogously in Vietnam, the enemy mingled with the populace,
so that even with the best of intentions, US forces wound up
killing a lot of ordinary civilians, a problem made far worse
by the stupid "body count" policy, where young ambitious
officers, like the future Senator Kerrey, were apt to rack up
very large body counts by any means convenient.
Senator Kerrey was cerrtainly a mass murderer, and the
guardsmen who stopped her from flying were certainly thugs,
but the reason there are arguably grounds for overlooking
Kerrey's cynical murders and the guardsmen's thuggery ,is
that in the face of this quite real threat even good people
will do things that are hard to distinguish from the things
that bad people do.     --digsig

has not proven popular is precisely because there is not
enough of a crackdown.  If the authorities really got heavy

No, will not come true.
All wars are good for government and bad for freedom, but a
short victorious war against a far away regime is likely to
be less bad than most.  If we lost the war, and the war on
terror turned inward, against Americans, and became like the
war on drugs, then it would have come true.
As I write this, the Taliban appears to have entirely
collapsed, which will presumably soon result in the Northern
alliance killing Bin Laden, and probably his children,
relatives, associates, and everyone in his general vicinity.
Problem solved.  Perhaps they return to the good old afghan
tradition of the women folk slowly skinning the foreigners
alive.  This was women's work, since men lack the patience
and manual dexterity required.
However, a wise government can always snatch defeat from the
jaws of victory.  It seems we are going to do some nation
building, fresh from our great successes in building the
nations of Iran and Somalia.  Right now the Afghans are
chanting "death to Arabs" but if we stick around too long,
doubtless we will once again be hearing "death to Americans"
Of course, the problem with building nations is that soldiers
cannot build nations.  At best, soldiers kill bad guys and
break their toys.  For nation building something rather more
is required, starting with a consensus.  It would seem they
are fair bit short of consensus in Afghanistan, though I saw
on television that they are working very hard at it.
The Afghan economy is entirely dependent on trade and
smuggling, as it has been for the past two thousand years,
which is a bit odd for a land-locked country occupied by
xenophobic people.  When local warlords put up roadblocks to
collect tariffs every short distance, the economy collapses,
as it did before the Taliban took over.
The obvious solution is for the various tribes, warlords,
militias, and armed mosques to  agree on freedom of
trade and movement, and agree to leave each other alone apart
from enforcing that.  Needless to say, such a solution does
not seem to be on the cards, particularly if we "help" them
form a government with a bunch of UN troops from various
islamic tyrannies and one islamic democracy.
Afghanistan cannot survive economically if divided into
mutually hostile ethnic and religious enclaves, nor can it
survive politically if  one centralized unitary government is
imposed on this quarrelsome patchwork of very different
tribes, races, and religions.  It will be hard for Afghan
politicians to steer a path between these two catastrophes. For foreign politicians, it will be near impossible.     --digsig

People want immediate and final settlement when purchasing

physically delivered.  Rather, for physical delivery, they
want the final settlement to be as closely tied to actual
delivery as possible --they want the arbitration provided by
the credit card companies.
In such a system, the digital certificates must ultimately
reflect control over assets, in other words they must be
functionally equivalent to bearer bonds and, more
importantly, bearer shares.
Needless to say, bearer shares are illegal almost everywhere.
Any system that does what you describe must be located in a
haven, and will be met by great wrath.
Often repressive countries, notably Ireland and China, offer
very free market conditions to foreign investors, while
keeping the assets of their own nationals under rigid
control.  In this situation nationals furtively export their
capital, then reimport their capital under the appearance of
being foreign capital.   Havens are used to launder this
capital, and bearer shares and similar mechanisms are used by
the nationals to keep control over this seemingly foreign
Thus even if the system you describe is simply a more
efficient settlement system, it is also a system that will
immediately enable large numbers of people to illegally
escape repressive controls on capital.
Thus just as any genuinely privacy protecting micropayment
system will promptly be used to pay for child pornography,
any genuinely efficient assets trading mechanism will
immediately be used to escape governmental controls, and is
already illegal on that basis.     --digsig

The Taliban was not a spontaneous internal phenomemom, not a response to an outcry for law and order.  There were repeated, massive, and bloody efforts by foreign powers, primarily Pakistan, to "assist" the aghans in achieving law and order, and the Taliban is only the most recent, and most bloody, of these.
Far from reflecting a spontaneous desire for government, law and order, these various wannabe governments found it necessary to devastate and depopulate vast areas that they were unable to govern.
The Taliban was only able to achieve "law and order" with massive external support, and an ever increasing number of foreign troops backing it up.
The foreigners would first back one group to form a government, and that group would fail catastrophically with enormous bloodshed, then they would back another group, and that group would in turn fail catastrophically with vast bloodshed, huge areas devastated by scorched earth policies where they killed everyone who did not flee, then bulldozed the houses, dynamited the wells, filled in the irrigation ditches, attempting to make any area they could not govern an utterly barren wasteland where nothing would grow and no one would live, and then finally, after two very bloody tries, the foreigners attempting to create a government backed the Taliban on their third try.
As we speak, the British and American governments are quarreling because the British want to have another go, a fourth try.  Each try has been bloodier, and more
devastating, than the last.     --digsig

Rothbard is scarcely distinguishable from Spooner, Spooner very much in the same camp as Tucker, and so forth.  If you go back a hundred years you can easily trace a thread of alliance and ideological connection connecting freemarket anarchists very similar to moderns with the most socialist Back before 1910, before socialist terror and tyranny had been tried to any large extent, there was no large gap between socialists an anarchists.  Most socialist thought that only a modest about of killings and beatings would be required, most anarchists thought that the less property rights were enforceable, the more giving and sharing their would be.
In the period 1936-1938 anarcho socialism was actually tried, and therefore the ideology ceased to exist among all those familiar with this bloody and disastrous experiment, except in the sense that many mourned over its failure, though the brand name continued to be cynically used for an utterly different program.  Those who continued to call themselves socialists after 1938 reinvented and reinterpreted the anarchists of the past, giving new and strange meanings to their words to strip them of any anarchist tendencies, like Mullah Omar torturing the text of the Koran to make it mean a garbled mixture of postmodernism, marxism, nationalism, and the customs and prejudices of his home village.
The parting of the ways came earlier in the US than it did in In the US, socialist anarchism faded sometime around the turn of the century.  In Europe, it died in 1936-1938
The history of anarchism in the US is as follows (simplified and abbreviated).
Originally there was no real distinction or separation between class struggle anarchism and individualist anarchism in the US.
The class struggle anarchists encountered a lack of working class support, and came to be dominated by vanguardists. Vanguardism is of course utterly incompatible with anarchism.
The split started when Tucker (then the most prominent individualist anarchist) denounced vanguardist "anarchists" who had been murdering various people, among them innocent working class people, to advance their political goals.  The split became progressively more vehement, with the individualist anarchists taking increasingly capitalistic The vanguardist anarchists, which you would call left anarchists, became utterly discredited by their excesses, and this, combined with a distinct lack of proletarian support, made possible an anti anarchist crackdown which for a time silenced all forms of anarchism in the US.
The anarchist movement in the US eventually recovered, but the class struggle anarchists remained discredited by their criminal excesses in the US, and by their inability to maintain any real connection with the US working class, and never recovered.  When the anarchist movement reappeared in the US, it was dominated by procapitalist thinkers who grounded their arguments in economic theory.  The leading lights of modern US anarchism have been economists.  The socialist "anarchists" in the US is a recent European import, merely an offshoot of the European movement which stole the anarchist brand name, when anarcho socialism died in Catalonia, much as modern liberals stole the "liberal" brand name in the US.     --digsig

If you do not like one guy's prices or wages, you can go to another, or start your own business.
Without property rights, the specialization of labor has to take place by something very like a state telling people what they must do, and what they may consume.  Thus to suppress capitalism requires centralized terror, and lots of it. Nothing less will suffice.  Been tried.
And indeed that terror is a large part of the attraction of socialism.  Observe the popularity among socialists of books by those who have murdered helpless captives.  Many socialists even name their ideology after mass murderers, for example Trotskyists.   One can hardly imagine some faction of neo-nazis naming themselves after one of Hitler's more prominent goons.
Similarly, when socialists celebrate great moments in socialist history, it is not the heroic battles they recall, but the murder of the helpless and powerless -- for example they recall not the last days of the Paris commune, but the first. Similarly observe how the Soviet Union, Mao's china, and the
rest ceased to be loved when the terror ceased.  When the
terror in the Soviet Union was in full flow, it was described
a glorious paradise where the concept of a policeman was
strange and unknown.  When the terror eased, then they
started to describe it as regrettably wicked, but nonetheless
a much lesser evil than the USA.     --digsig

nerve gas, and another witness seemingly admits to personally

James A. Donald:
The US, unlike the countries whose system so many prefer to impose on the US, has sufficient freedom of speech that that cannot happen without causing grave embarrassment.  Recollect that dying in battle gives very different honors, compensation etc.  If if the army falsified the circumstances of a soldier's death there would be mutiny in the ranks.
CIA deaths can go unreported, and probably usualy do.  Army deaths cannot, because of a system designed to encourage and recognize valor.
The low death rates in recent conflicts have made some people suspicious.  How can the US army get casualty ratio of something like ten thousand to one, when fighting against people with comparable weapons?  And if the US is made of supermen, why did it suffer heavy casualties in Vietnam and In my judgment the big change is the change from a conscript army, a slave army, to a warrior army.  Firstly this makes the soldiers more valuable to the officers, since deaths cost the army big money.  Every casualty means that the pay and benefits have to be considerably higher.  In a free market, the burden of hazardous employment falls on the employer, so the employer has an incentive to provide safe employment. Secondly, the apparatus of coercion that attempts to force conscripts to fight against their will frequently forces them into danger that a competent warrior would never have gone into, or would promptly have left.
With warrior armies, the losing side typically suffers almost one hundred percent of the casualties.  These absurdly lopsided casualty rates have been normal throughout much of
the last few thousand years of history.  These recent figures
do not indicate the US army is composed of supermen, merely
that recent wars have been victorious, and that the US army
is now composed of warriors.     --digsig

The alternative being a likelyhood of spending twenty years
in prison for something he did not do.  The fact that he

evidence that the prosecution had no real case.
During the recovered memory hysteria, lots of clearly
innocent people confessed to raping their children.  The
prosecution in those cases was prepared to agree to almost
anything that involved a confession, rather than actually go
to court, and use any measures, including horrific criminal
threats against people's children, to force a confession.
Once a few cases actually did go to court, the scam was
exposed, and suddenly people stopped recovering memories.  As
the prosecutor's fear of trials became more and more obvious,
the plea bargains became more and more absurd.  Typically
someone would admit to extraordinary and hideous crimes

In order to give value to ecoins, it is necessarily to make them convertible with some other currency, normally an account based currency. It is difficult to do this without supporting accounts.
One could of course have a pile of gold, and physically and in person exchange coins for physical gold, but it is considerably more convenient to exchange coins for account based money, such as e-gold.  It is difficult to make such transactions entirely atomic, because of the possibility that something might go wrong, requiring durable state.  We then need a database key for that state.  Such a database key looks rather like an account
This only works if the transaction is complete and final, for example downloading pornography, or for people who meet physically, and exchange physical assets for ecash.  If the transaction is for account assets outside the system, then the transaction must have state that looks very like an account, if only a transient The value of e-gold is ultimately maintained by physical transfers with a pile of gold inside a vault outside US jurisdiction.  It takes a great deal of time and cost to actually transfer stuff to and from that vault, hence the numerous intermediaries.  The intermediaries therefore find it convenient to maintain accounts with e-gold.
While accounts are not needed for many transactions, and should be avoided where possible, they are convenient for many transactions, and essential for some.

denunciation of capitalism, and then told the Argentinians
that in order to save them from capitalism, he was going to
confiscate their dollars and replace them with nonconvertible
pesos. When the Argentinians understood just how they were

As we speak, while the Argentinian government is implementing

Argentina is akin to the situation in the Soviet Union

https begat e-gold, which will in due course beget Chaumian

VPN has also had a major impact in moving multinationals,

servile to the state, towards the cypherpunk side of the
fence.  I anticipate that teleconferencing over VPN is going

The big difference between the anarcho socialists and real anarchists such as Spooner and Molinari was that the collectivist faction among the anarchists was always self contradictory and inconsistent.  Bakunin advocated real anarchy, and also advocated parliamentary democracy, and also
advocated rule by the vanguard of the proletariat, and also
condemned democracy and rule by the vanguard with devastating
prophetic rhetoric. Proudhon made a virtue of self
contradiction with a dozen self contradictory slogans, most
famously "Property is theft, property is sacred", a merely
rhetorical escape from the inherent contradictions between
socialism and anarchism.
Then came the debacle of 1936-1938, where these contradictions became manifest not merely in words and rhetoric, but in blood, terror, tyranny, and slavery.
Since 1938 what had been confused thought, became for the most part cynical hypocrisy.  Today's "anarcho" socialists identify not what with some of the anarchists may have intended to implement in Catalonia, but rather with what they actually wound up implementing  They identify with recently existent "anarcho" socialism, which was not very different from recently existent socialism.  They also identify with the Paris Commune, which was a military coup against a freely and fairly elected government, where none of those seizing power thought themselves anarchists, and where the new rulers in the end ruled by terror.     --digsig

Wow!  Universal public and secret keys, not one per true

At last, the universal public key cryptography infrastructure
we have all been waiting for! The documentation says that
this key infrastructure is available for everyone, though
Microsoft's email program does not seem aware of this.
Outlook express insists on certified keys, though very few
people, other than web site operators, seem willing to jump
through all the hoops needed create and maintain certified
keys. Right now these universal keys are only used in file
recovery (the symmetric key is encrypted to the
administrator's public key.)  But if one has universal public
key pairs linked to one's computer login, the obvious thing
is to use them in communication.  Of course there is no one
to one relationship between email addresses and login ids, so
one would need to wrap the encrypted body in a header that
says that it can only be read on machine so and so, by user

Back in the big period of revolutions, the late eighteenth

trying to intrude themselves into anything that seems to be on the
side of the future, and the side of revolution
In fact of course, revolutions, now as back then, have been
capitalist, and often anti socialist, and the socialist presence
and influence in these revolutionary and subversive movements has
generally been as hostile and alien as that of Jim Choate and
Mathew X is among us.   Thus the Soviet communist revolution was
in fact a counterrevolutionary coup, carried on by a tiny
conspiratorial group against a chaotic revolutionary regime,
Castro purported to be making anti communist revolution against
the communist Batista, the Sandinistas came to power with Violetta
Chamorro as their front woman, and then dumped this supposed
leadership once they got their hands on power, and so on and so
This intrusion has generally had the same levels of hostility and
anger as we see in Jim Choate and Mathew X.  For example until
1944 the Soviet KGB administrator, Ho Chi Minh, working behind his
desk in Moscow, had the agents under his direction spent far more
time, energy, and effort murdering Vietnamese nationalists than
they did killing colonialists.     --digsig

Possibly, but what does it benefit the US to hang around in the middle East?  Why are we sending very large sums of money and loads of arms to Israelis, who hate us venemously, to Egyptians, who hate us maniacally, to Saudis, who hate us suicidally, money that enrages the rest of the middle East, and the subjects of Egypt, and Saudi Arabia even more?
Now one might suppose there is some benefit to assisting Kuwait, which is sitting on a large lake of oil, and whose citizens merely hate us irrationally.  Israel, and Palestine however, are mostly of significance due the extreme sacredness of three rocks, and the

Rapid fire weapons are generally not designed to bring down people

Military weapons are generally not designed to kill quickly.  A

An ideal low fire rate weapon will in a single shot so badly wound
a man that he will soon die, unless he receives very prompt and
expert medical attention, but does not "drop" him.

To clarify, this means that if you have a home network with a gateway computer, you can probably get global static IPV6 addresses for all the machines of your home network, though you might have trouble getting software to use this, or finding people to who can access your computers in IPV6
However, for a corporation, such measures make sense and are useful, because it means they can videoconference within the corporation, and also with other corporations that have adopted the same measure -- video conferencing being the P2P app used by people who are willing to pay money for it.

To connect to the IPV6 world from inside a NAT network, you need a
machine that is both inside and outside the NAT network, a gateway
machine that has an IP4 an external address, even if only a
dynamic address. Then all machines on the inside can talk to the
outside through that machine, thus they can all receive quasi
static IP6 addresses, even though not even the gateway machine
possesses a static IP4 address.
The question then is when will ISP's feel pressure to provide such
a a gateway?

IPV6 to the rescue.
Every network behind a NAT router should set up a 6to4 tunnel,
probably some time early in 2003.
IPv6 is almost source code compatible with IPv4, so every
application should soon be recompiled to be IPv6 compatible.
Every computer with a recent operating system, for example recent
linux kernels and windows XP, theoretically supports IPv6.
So if your P2P application is IPv6 compatible, you can get a semi
permanent IPv6 IP automatically from a server, and thereafter do
peer to peer, just as if you were full, no kidding, on the

@_subject: Anonymous transactions and controlled nymity transactions. 
--
In a strictly anonymous transactions  one cannot prove that there was any agreement to pay, or any payment, to anyone in particular.
For many purposes, what one wants is transactions with controlled nymity, where Alice can prove she paid Bob such and such an amount, in accordance with such and such an agreement, but does not need to reveal every payment to the bank in order to prove this for the on payment that goes wrong.
Strictly anonymous transactions work well for small payments that are frequently repeated.  Because the payments are small, tracking identity is a burdensome overhead, and if the payer does not get what he wants, he merely wanders off elsewhere.
Pornography, on the model of those machines where one keeps inserting quarters to keep the video rolling, or interactive pornography, where one makes ad hoc payments to the performers, are good applications for strictly anonymous payments.
However there are many applications, some of them more respectable and perhaps larger volume, where controlled nymity is appropriate. One important such application is the gray market.  Usually the payer wishes to conceal his real identity from the recipient, and also does not wish anyone to know that there has been a transaction between payer and supplier.
Goods on the gray market are gray for a variety of reasons. Sometimes, like straying wives or husbands, businesses are making deals they do not wish major customers or suppliers to find out The gray market softly shades into the black market.  There are deals that are not exactly illegal, but which the parties would prefer the government not to find out about.  For example the government often restrains businesses from cutting prices, or forcefully encourages them to maintain prices at an artificially high level.  Undue price cuts might be penalized as dumping, as unfair competition, and so on and so forth.  For example exporters are generally required to participate in export cartels, which they tend to ignore.  A german company selling goods in the US too cheaply is likely to be punished by German authorities for unfairly competing with other german firms, and by US authorities as "dumping".  A US firm selling goods too cheaply in the US might be harassed by the justice department for "predation".
To perform a transaction with controlled nymity, as is required to support gray market transactions, I propose the following Buyer and seller make a deal, perhaps on a website like EBay where they are identified by handles.  They agree to a delivery contact. The payee registers the transaction with the money issuer, the registration consisting of a hash code of the contract the amount to be paid, and a transient public key.   The payer deposits Chaumian coins to the required amount to the transaction record, creating a public record that the contract has been paid, though by whom and to whom does not become known unless the contract corresponding to the hash code is made public, and not necessarily
even then, since the parties to the contract are identified by
handles, with reputations associated with the handles, as at Ebay.
The payee then withdraws the coins, encrypted using the public key
associated with the contract, a process that creates no traceable
connection between the handle and supplier and beneficiary.     --digsig

Obviously that is a claim that cannot be directly documented,
since most people decline to register their business with the
department of census and statistics as "engaged primarily in
illegal activity"
However every business that I have been involved in, where I have
been in a position to know, has been extensively violating some
laws in some fashion -- personal anecdotes, where I cannot give
There are also many sweeping decrees where it is not clear what is
intended, or what will be enforced, and one can make a plausible
argument that current practice is arguably legal -- but not a very
good argument.  For example AOL, Verant, Yahoo, and perhaps
Microsoft are arguably in violation of COPA.  Almost everyone
necessarily operates in gray areas, often fairly openly, and
wherever I have been in a position to know, most people were in
some respects operating in black areas, not at all openly.
There are so many laws, that it is impossible to operate a
business entirely legally.
What is extraordinary about this claim:  If most individuals can
rack up multiple felony offenses while scarcely realizing it,
think what a pickle the average business must be in.
When the federal register is requires a fleet of trucks, when I
have committed several hundred years worth of felonies without
doing anything that the ordinary middle respectable middle class
male would regard as very disreputable, I do not see what is so
extraordinary about that claim.
Add AOL, Yahoo, Verant, and Microsoft to the crips and the bloods.
My usenet server has a sign up web page that emphasizes privacy,
anonymity, lack of logs, absence of censorship, and completeness
of newsgroups -- I get the impression that a large part of their
customer base is people downloading child pornography.
In Russia what we saw is not so much legalization, as collapse of
enforcement -- the long existing illegal market that kept Stalin's

With the Dmitri Sklyarov case, and the DeCSS case, we already have bit crimes, where possession of certain software capabilities is an illegal act.
Of course, each software capability that is criminalized requires other software capabilities to be criminalized.  In the end the law has to legalize them all, or else criminalize them all.
In the end, the camel has to be wholly in the tent, with programmer licensing, a ban on the sale of new general purpose computers to unauthorized people, (expect a spate of television
shows with demonic computer salemen whose lust for profit empowers
international terrorists) and a ban on unauthorized possession of
programming tools, or else the camel has to be wholly out of the

The natural instinct of businessmen is to do a deal, and the natural instinct of politicians is to compromise and build a coalition, but the nature of the beast does not permit compromise. In the end, it has to be all illegal, or all legal.  There is no alternative to confrontation.  The MPAA already sees this. Everyone else has to see it also.

Obviously, the end of copyright may well mean a substantial
reduction in the proceeds from big movies, but it will hardly mean
a total end to those proceeds (the powerpuff girl movie is one big
toy advertisment)
How big an effect will a reduction in money mean?
If you go back thirty years, you will notice that lots of movies
were produced on a budget vastly smaller than todays movies.  For
example I noticed a Hitchcock movie where a car and a car wreck
was central to the plot, and most of the story line took place
inside a wrecked car..  However, Hitchcock by use of cheesy camera
angles, avoided any need for the car to suffer any actual damage,
or even the need to go out and buy a wreck.
Go back even further, and people do not bother with production
values at all.   Thus Macbeth says "why upon this blasted heath
you stop our way with such prophetic greeting?", presumably
because Shakespeare was too cheap to have a backdrop painted
depicting a blasted heath.
So the end of copyright will not mean the end of movies, but
merely cheaper effects, and since computers are making effects
cheaper daily, with imaginary landscapes made inside a computer,
and real landscapes massively altered, we probably will not notice
any effect at all.   The landscapes of Lord of the Rings, though

The plan, as envisaged by our enemies, is that first almost  everyone will voluntarily run a "trusted" operating system in order to view copyrighted entertainment.   The major capability of the new hardware will be to advertise to servers that trusted software is in control.  Then new hardware that is willing to run an "untrusted" operating system will be banned. After all, only pirates, drug trafficers, money launderers, and child pornographers are running untrusted software. Then only properly degreed people will be authorized to work on untrusted operating systems and hardware campable of running them.  The qualifications for being properly degreed, like the qualifications for medicine, will become increasing related to control and less related to competence.  Unauthorized possession of untrusted hardware will become subject to increasingly severe sanctions, and net access will only be possible through a gateway and proxies running trusted sofware.
Of course the flaw in this is step one -- almost everyone runs a  "trusted" operating system.   When step one does not seem to be  happening, it will be announced to be largely complete, and then  step two will be launched prematurely, and so will encounter  considerable hostility..

The high point of support for socialism among the masses in the US was the 1870s, give or take a couple of decades.
By 1900 socialists around the world had given up all hope of genuinely revolutionary seizure of power, and were pursuing conspiratorial paths.
The 1930s was the high point of support for socialism among the intellectuals, the privileged, and the elite.  Their efforts to foist their preferences on the American masses met with resounding hostility and reluctance.  Not only was there no danger of a socialist revolution, in the US or anywhere else, but in the US the leadership's attempts to force socialism down peoples throats met stubborn resistance.
There was more mass support for socialism in other countries, but no socialist revolutions in those countries, nor any danger of such revolt.  There were socialist coups, and conspiratorial seizures of power by socialists in other countries.     --digsig

In the 1930s Stalin's servants, Foster and Ford, ran for
president, all the great and the good, the top intellectuals at
the top universities, all fulsomely backed them, and of course
they got votes down in the asterixs.
In America the communist threat was always conspiratorial.  Actual
support by the actual working class was as near to nonexistent as
makes no difference.
In the 1870s there was in America working class movement bent on
class warfare.  It utterly discredited itself with murder,
sabotage, and crime, and by the 1890s was dead as a doornail,
never to rise again.
Ever since then, socialism in America has been an elitist
movement, composed of the children of the rich and powerful.

James A. Donald:
A moment ago you were arguing maximum utility (your public good argument)  Now you concede utility, and argue rights, but copyright, unlike real property, is merely a conventional right, created by the will and power of the state, not a natural right.
If that convention ceases to be convenient and useful, ceases to have utility, we should not continue it.
And if you are going to argue from long established conventional rights, copyright has been extended by twenty years every twenty years, so it is not a long established conventional right.
Returning to your public good argument.  As more and more stuff piles up, the production of new stuff becomes a less and less valuable public good.  At the same time, as with any "public good", congress (being in the pocket of state created interest groups) creates greater and greater incentives to produce more and more of this public good.
If an anarchic free market underproduces public goods, government subject to interest groups overproduces public goods, a problem that is particularly serious with such dubious public goods as "defense", cultural or racial purity, and so on and so forth.     --digsig

--
Voluntary DRM is indeed a form of smart contract,
If there was no pressure from the content industry, if copyright
and patent law was not expanding lawlessly and corruptly, in
defiance of technological trends, it would not worry me.
If the smarts were in a dongle that that you attached to your USB
port, or in a program that you could run or not run, it would not
worry me.
The trouble is that this idea looks as the a stalking horse for
the policeman inside your computer.
The history of this idea is as follows:
The entertainment industry proposed and lobbied for an proposal to
stop ordinary consumers to from having any more real computers.
They wanted legislation, the SSSCA which would prohibit consumers
from buying computers that could be programmed to do whatever the
programmer desired.  The computer industry went ballistic,
foreseeing that customers would refuse to "upgrade" to these new,
crippled, computers, and the proposal appears dead in the water. However it is the nature of businessmen to always try to make a
deal, so any such conflict will be followed by some attempt to
make a settlement with the entertainment industry, and
palladium/DRM seems to be such a settlement.
On the one hand, if the DRM is truly voluntary, it will not hurt
upgrade sales, so the computer industry genuinely wants DRM to be
truly voluntary, just as claimed.
On the other hand, if DRM computers are acceptable to the masses,
and are usually run in DRM mode, then IF they are widely accepted,
the computer industry could accept a law mandating involuntary DRM
in all new computers without losing sales.
 Thus DRM represents a marketing feeler -- it represents the
computer industry trying to see to what extent it can make
computers acceptable to the content industry without making them
unacceptable to the user.     --digsig

In an anarchic society, or under a government that did not define and defend IP, TCPA/Palladium would probably give roughly the right amount of protection to intellectual property by technical means in place of legal means.
Chances are that the thinking behind Palladium is not "Let us sell out to the Hollywood lobby" but rather "Let us make those !@ commie chinese pay for their *&^%$ software".
Of course, in a society with both legal and technical protection of IP, the likely outcome is oppressive artificial monopolies sustained both by technology and state power.

But this is not what the content providers want.  They want that if you disable the Fritz chip, the computer does not boot.  What they want is that it shall be illegal to sell a computer capable of booting if the Fritz chip is disabled.

Your account of TCPA is that smooth and reassuring account given
in the TCPA FAQ
When I read the more technical account
 , and
.pdf ,
I do not see anything so reassuring.  I see scary
phrases like "root of trust".
These more technical specs give lots of irrelevant detail, and
very little detail that is actually informative.   We get a
mixture of smooth sales talk, and blind-em-with-bafflegab
technical vagueness.
Some of the details in the technical spec seem inconsistent with
the smooth and reassuring account.  For example:
: : 	"The replacement of code in the platform must be
: : 	performed by a platform manufacturer approved method
: : 	or agent.  This allows the manufacturer to establish
: : 	an upgrade method ...."
This seems to the say that the TPM has non read write storage containing non volatile code that is privileged, and can be
changed, but not however by the user.
This would imply that the TPM could be used to enforce any policy
whatever, and not necessarily a policy so benevolent as that
promised in the sales talk versions of the white papers.
You have told us that the TPM is turned off by default, but "off"
is merely an off flag, not a full physical off.  According to the
technical spec
: : 	"The core root of trust measurement (CRTM) MUST be an
: : 	immutable feature of the platform's initialization
: : 	code that executes on platform reset."
This is not what most people mean by "off".   It provides the
physical capability to prohibit unauthorized software from
running, even if the nice salesman tells us that capability will
never be used.

You have lost me, I have no idea why you think what you are  talking about might be relevant to my assertion.
The TPM has its own secret key, it makes the corresponding public key widely available to everyone, and its own internal good known
time.  So  when your customer's payment goes through, you then
send him a  copy of your stuff encrypted to his TPM, a copy which
only his TPM  can make use of.  Your code, which the TPM decrypts
and executes,  looks at the known good time, and if the user is
out of time, refuses to play.       --digsig

Obviously as long as TPM is not backed by legal force, it cannot
do anything very bad.   But the TPM technology puts my throat

Hollywood and the government, would like the internet to be like
television, a few big businesses steadily churning out content,
and everyone else passively consuming it.
Microsoft really would not like that, since, despite all their
faults, they are in the computer business.
This is analogous to the difference between Hitler and Stalin.
Hitler wanted to enslave the whole world right away, Stalin wanted
to enslave the world bit by bit as the opportunity permitted, and
whenever the time was ripe .
Thus it made sense for the west to ally with Stalin.  Trouble was,
Stalin thought it made sense to ally with Hitler.
My concern is not that Bill Gates is in bed with hollywood, but
rather than Microsoft may be trying to compromise, may be trying
to make a deal, over a matter where in truth no deal is possible,
no compromise can work.
Microsoft really does not want an internet that is regulated like
TV.  Hollywood really does.  Analogously Stalin wanted most of
Eastern Europe, and Hitler wanted all of Eastern Europe, and then
some.   Sooner or later, Microsoft has to come out on our side.
Let us hope sooner, rather than later.
Microsoft, like Hollywood, wants unreasonable and burdensome
levels of intellectual property protection, but they do not want
to destroy computing in order to get it.  Hollywood, and to a
lesser extent the government, would be happy to destroy
unauthorized individual and small business computing and
networking even if it did not help them sustain unreasonable and
burdensome levels of intellectual property protection.
This does not mean we should give Microsoft the benefit of the
doubt on Palladium.  It does mean we cannot automatically assume
that Microsoft is completely in bed with Hollywood.     --digsig

You just plug it into a usb port, poke your card into the reader and a browser window pops up, and takes you to the web page for that smartcard.  If any software is needed, then it is in the form of activeX component, which means that the only installation interface is "Do you trust this software from so-and-so?"

I have found that the administrative costs of PKI are   intolerable. End users do not really understand crypto, and so will fuck up. Only engineers can really control a PKI   certificate, and for the most part they just do not.
In principle the thingness of a smartcard should reduce   administrative costs to a low level -- they should supposedly  act like a purse, a key, a credit card, hence near zero user   training required.  The simulated thingness created by   cryptographic cleverness should be manifested to the user as   physical thingness of the card.
Suppose, for example, we had working Chaumian digicash.  Now   imagine how much trouble the average end user is going to get  into with backups, and with moving digicash from one computer  to another.  If all unused Chaumian tokens live in a smartcard, one might expect the problem to vanish.  The purselike   character of the card sustains the coin like character of   Chaumian tokens.
Of course if one has to supply the correct driver for the smart card, then the administration problem reappears.
USB smartcard interfaces could solve this problem.   Just plug them in, and bingo, it should just go.  Ummh, wait a moment, go where, do what?  What happens when one plugs in a USB smartcard
Still, making crypto embodied in smart cards intelligible to   the masses would seem to be a soluble problem, even if not yet solved, whereas software only crypto is always going to boggle the masses.        --digsig

Supposedly tens of thousands turned up, forty two thousand in San Francisco
Yet oddly, the photos of marches that I see look more like forty in San Francisco, and four hundred in Washington.
Perhaps there were a lot more out of frame, but that is an odd way to photograph a demonstration.
Does anyone know the truth from his own eyes, or a more complete set of images?  At least some newspapers are reporting "hundreds" or four hundred in Washington, while others are reporting eighty thousand, an number curiously different from four hundred.  However it seems that all papers are reporting forty two thousand in San Francisco.
The inconsistency in the reports from Washington incline me to doubt the reports from San Francisco, but of course there is a plentiful supply of liars on both sides of the fence.     --digsig

Mojo was intended to do this but it failed, I think it failed
because they failed to monetize mojo before it was introduced
as service management mechanism.
We should get an anonymous micropayment system working,
interconvertible to real money, or real e-gold, then apply it
to such applications as mixmasters and darknet.

I don't think so.
Verisign's authentication is notoriously worthless and full of
holes, yet very few attacks have been based on getting
certificates issued to wrong party, or on stealing poorly
defended and readily accessible certificates, even though that
is quite easy to do.
One of the scams described in the paper you cite was the old
" scam, but done using paper, rather than the
internet -- the scammers registered a company name similar that
of a target  company owning a large block of IP addresses, and
printed letter head paper similar to that of the other company.
The problem was not that authentication was hard.  Passwords
would have sufficed.   Self signed public keys would have
worked even better.

Why are the homes steadily getting bigger, while the number of inhabitants in the home get steadily smaller?
You guys have been making up this data ever since Marx rewrote Gladstone's budget speech, to have Gladstone declare that "this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power ... is an augmentation entirely confined to classes of property."
When in fact Gladstone said the direct opposite, and proved it with statistics, proved that the poor had experienced, as a result of the industrial revolution "this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power"
This is the same moron marxism as expressed in the word "sweatshop": To a naive and ignorant socialist it seems that if each man selfishly pursues his own desire, the result will necessarily be chaos and hardship, that one person's plan will naturally harm those that are not part of it, hence such phrases and concepts as "sweatshop" which presuppose that one man producing a plan to create value and another man providing equipment to implement that plan, has somehow magically made the workers in a poor country worse off, that saving, investment and entrepeneurship is unproductive, that investment, particularly investment by rich people creating the means of production in poor countries, is a plot to swindle the poor, a scam, a transfer from poor to rich.     --digsig

If today warfare means wiping out the family of the enemy ruler

Major Variola (ret)
Presumably Alice prepares a bunch of unblinded tokens, marks them "for Bob" and encrypts them so that only the bank can read Bob then gives that message to the bank, and the bank then tells Bob "yes, its a valid payment for 25 grams of gold to Since Alice knows the secrets embedded in that message, she can prove that she originated that message, so she can prove she paid Bob, but no one else can prove it.  She can prove that to Bob, or to anyone, assuming the bank cooperates.
Of course this means the bank knows how much money everyone is paying Bob, even if it does not know who is paying Bob.
Also Alice cannot prove that the money was accompanied by the message "OK Bob, here is the twenty five grams of gold, deliver the Maltese falcon tonight." and thus cannot prove that Bob, by accepting the tokens valid for the gold, agreed to deliver the Maltese Falcon.
Perhaps these two problems can be fixed.
Alice encrypts a message to the bank containing the unblinded tokens.  It also contains instructions 'accept this deposit only if accompanied by a number whose hash is X, and only if the message is signed with the private key corresponding to this public key 89798759754.
Alice puts this encrypted message to the bank inside a a message to the Bob, which contains the instructions: "OK Bob, here is the twenty five grams of gold, deliver the Maltese falcon tonight.  Here is a cheque made out to cash, for 25 grams of gold, valid if accompanied by the hash of this message, and signed with private key 1764383486*b, where b is whatever your private key is.   Signed Alice."
Bob delivers the cheque, (an encrypted message to the bank) and the bank validates it as correctly formed and containing valid unspent unblinded tokens, and gives him blinded tokens for 25 grams of gold.
To prove that it was Bob who did indeed deposit this money, Alice reveals to the bank the message corresponding to the hash, and thus reveals that 89798759754.= B^1764383486, where B is Bob's public key, and thus, if the bank keeps a record of the exchange, proves that it was Bob who made the exchange, and that the money was from Alice, and was for the Maltese falcon.     --digsig

There is a big problem in that "quasi"
Because paypal payments are reversible, Paypal finds itself
very reluctantly in the business of arbitrating disputes, a

badly indeed.
The integration with Ebay was intended to reduce this problem,
since ebay does rather well at arbitrating disputes, but
paypal's arbitration is still universally loathed.
If your business model sticks you with performing arbitration,
you find yourself up against the credit card companies, the
eight hundred pound gorilla of arbitration, who do it well, and
more importantly, do it a lot cheaper than you can.

What we want of a payment system, is that Alice can prove she
paid Bob, even if Bob wants to deny it, but no one else can
prove that Alice paid Bob unless Alice takes special action to
make it provable.
(This provides permits recipient anonymity in that Bob can be
an alternate identity of Dave, and no one can prove that money
paid to Bob actually winds up with Dave.  They can, however
prove they paid Bob.)
If Alice pays Bob in unblinded tokens, this does not help, for
Bob can pass the unblinded tokens to yet another identity of
his, Fred.
One solution is for the bank to maintain an email linked
account for Bob, into which Alice pays.  This sounds ominous,
for the next step might be to link the account to true names,
can anyone see any other problems with it.     --digsig

For this to happen, the attacker must solicit the the victim to log on to a site he has never logged onto before, or redirect him to logon to a site he has never logged onto before.  In this situation, the SSH uncertified public keys work far better than Verisign's certified keys -- for example the spam email urging us to log on to "e-golb.com" or "e-go1d.com" would fail if https used ssh style public keys, because the user would get a "new site" dialog, tipping him off that something was up, and that he should check what is going on.
Thus under this attack, ssh uncertified keys work far better than https certified keys.
Far safer to do that than to rely on https certified keys, as lots of people discovered who logged into "e-go1d.com" or The victim never expects the server to have a new key, and in the unlikely event he did expect it the out of band mechanism notifying him of the new key is under the sites control, not the attackers.

For a long time the US has been the center of the world
monetary system, and the US dollar the base money of which all
others are derivatives.
The primary way of doing transactions on the internet is by
credit card, with the headquarters and computers located in the
USA.  The secondary way is by paypal, located in the USA.
Paypal and credit card requires information that ultimately
links to your true name and social security number, and people
in those peripheral and backward countries that do not yet have
their system of government issued identity well integrated to
that of the USA, for example Poland, cannot use Paypal.
The US government makes a big profit out of this, effectively
gaining an interest free loan on each dollar it prints, and it
also leverages it into a source of power.  Those it disapproves
of are cut off from the mainstream money system.
Now if one cuts a few terrorists off from the money system, no
problem, but when one cuts off large numbers of terrorists,
suspected terrorists, suspected child pornographers, suspected
money launderers, suspected tax dodgers,  and the entire
population of Poland, who is being cut off?  The terrorists or
the US?
Well people, I think the money system has just turned upside
down.  The money launderers are not being cut off from the US
led international monetary system.  Instead the US is being cut
off from the money launderer led international monetary system.
The two most popular no-true-name accounts are e-gold an
I googled for web pages containing both the word "egold" and
the word "moneybookers".  Got lots of hits, seems that lots of
quite ordinary people are finding it cheaper or more convenient
to mediate international transactions through computers that
are not located in the US and whose accounts are not coupled to
true names.
The great majority of people and money are still going through
the US led system, and since people are reluctant to change,
that will continue for a long time.  But they no longer have
to, and for most people in the world, there is no longer a good
reason why they should.
A no-true-name account is inherently cheaper than a true-name
account, because of the high cost of managing true names.  The
early adopters seem to be largely people who are sensitive to
the cost of setting up accounts.
However, a no-true-name account still faces the problem that it
is reversible, dragging the issuer into the arbitration
business, which most issuers are not competent to do.   All
users have to pay a transaction cost reflecting arbitration
costs, whether they want their transactions to be arbitrable or
not.  The solution to that cost, is chaumian money.  The fact
that no-true-name money seems to be beating true-name money
leads me hope that economics can beat inertia and regulation.     --digsig

When a mailing list is full of crap, it dies, even though the  regulars set killfiles to silence the offending posters.  The  reason is, no new people arrive.
New people subscribe, see nothing but crap, unsubscribe.
A mailing list or newsgroup needs a strong personality who is a prolific poster who keeps discussions on track, issues lots of good stuff, and reprimands trolls and nuts.  That person, of   course was Tim May.  (past tense)
It also needs a continual stream of new people, who bring new  ideas, and unfamiliar ways of recognizing old ideas.
The relentless mass spamming by professor rat and Jim Choate   keeps new comers away, since 99% of the posts to the list is   from people who hate the ideas that the list was created to    further, and seek to shut it down, to prevent thought about and discussion of such ideas, and Tim May has succumbed to terminal grumps on discovering that the crypto transcendence is not    coming soon.
So when is the crypto trancendence coming?  When does an    encryption enabled internet start to undermine the power of the Well it is a little like web groceries.  During the Dot.com    hype, lots of web grocery companies popped up, and made about a cent on the dollar.  They vanished, but, surprise surprise,    there are now some real web grocery firms,  and they are    making a little bit of money.
Darknet (frost over freenet) is going tolerably well, mostly in its Japanese incarnation, the repression being stronger in    Japan.  The Japanese experience tells us that any repression   short of communist levels of repression will make darknet    stronger, not weaker.  The big threat to frost over freenet is the natifying of the net which makes more and more people into clients, not peers.   Theoretically frost over freenet serves   even those behind NATs, but really it does not, and cannot.
Private money on the internet remains a small, non anonymous,  There is no Chaumian anonymity.  There is some "trust us"    anonymity, located on offshore islands, controlled by people   quite susceptible to US pressure.
Account based money without true names or the mark of the beast is a tiny but profitable business.  E-gold is probably the    largest player, with about two million dollars a day changing  hands, and twenty thousand micropayments a day (payments of    less than a dollar)
Two million a day is one five hundred thousandth of the     turnover on the US$, and it is not growing very fast.  Of    course e-gold is just one of several, but it probably a large  portion of the total.
Suppose no-true-name account based money grows at thirty    percent a year, which seems plausible.	In due course    some substantial portion of it will be chaumian.
Then the US$ goes into crisis in 2060. As Adam Smith put it,   "There is a lot of ruin in a nation.".
Even if we suppose that the institutions of the crypto    trancendence undergo remarkably rapid growth, the kind of    growth that the dot bombs predicted in their business plans,   the crypto trancendence does not hit until around 2025.
But right now today, the internet is undermining the power of  the state.  The Japanese government went as far as democracy   can go, and perhaps a bit further, to shut down file sharing.  The result:  Widespread adoption of software based on freenet. Cypherpunks 1, state 0.  We have a long way to go, but we are  Oh yeah, and once again I declare the mailing list that gave  the name of this movement to be dead, though the fact that I am still posting on it would seem to prove it is alive, though
breathing its last.

Lower case letters represent integers, capital letters elliptic
curve points.
Let k be the banks secret key.
The bank promises to pay a specific sum of money for any secret
of the form ( x, P), such that P = k * H(x) where H is a hash
function mapping random integers onto points on an elliptic
curve and k is a secret known only to the token issuer
Bob has an existing old used token of this form, and therefore
knows that V= k * U even though he does not know k.
Bob invents the random numbers t and q, constructs an elliptic
point R = t *U + Hash( q ) and pays the bank to construct T= k
* R
He then calculates Q = T- t * V
He now has a new token ( q , Q) of the required form, even
though the Bank did not generate Q, has never seen it before,
and when it sees it will not recognize it as having any
relationship to T or R.     --digsig

 I want fully deniable information storage -- information  theoretic deniable, not merely steganographic deniable, for  stenography can never be wholly secure.
So I would have a fixed sized block of data containing a variable number of smaller secret chunks of data.  A random key would extract a random length of gibberish, a valid key would extract a stream of valid data, and revealing one secret key to the adversary would not give the adversary any evidene that more secrety keys were present or absent.
Any good known algorithms for this?     --digsig

I want to store information deniably.
So there would be a fixed sized block of data, say one megabyte, increasing by multiples of 8 as needed.
This would contain various items of information that one could extract by supplyin a secret, symmetric, key.   A random key would extract a block of gibberish of random length   There would be no indication as to how many bits of meaningful data were stored in the block, though obviously they would have to add up to less than the size of the block.
So one could store one's password list under one key, and the location of the dead bodies under another key, and absent that key, there would be no evidence that they key, or information hidden under that key, existed.
What is a good algorithm for this?

Clay Shirky: tells us "The RIAA Succeeds Where the Cypherpunks Failed"
The Government's failure to get the Clipper implemented came at a heady time for advocates of digital privacy -- the NSA was losing control of cryptographic products, Phil Zimmerman had launched his Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) email program, and the Cypherpunks, a merry band of crypto-loving civil libertarians, were on the cover of the second issue of Wired. The floodgates were opening, leading to...
...pretty much nothing. Even after the death of Clipper and the launch of PGP, the Government discovered that for the most part, users didn't want to encrypt their communications. [...]
In response to the RIAA's suits, users who want to share music files are adopting tools like WINW and BadBlue, that allow them to create encrypted spaces where they can share files and converse with one another. [...] Note that the broadening adoption of encryption is not because users have become libertarians, but because they have become criminals; to a first approximation, every PC owner under the age of 35 is now a felon.
And the second effect, of course, is the long-predicted and oft-delayed spread of encryption. The RIAA is succeeding where the Cypherpunks failed, convincing users to trade a broad but penetrable privacy for unbreakable anonymity under their personal control. In contrast to the Cypherpunks "eat your peas" approach, touting encryption as a first-order service users should work to embrace, encryption is now becoming a background feature of collaborative workspaces. Because encryption is becoming something that must run in the background, there is now an incentive to make it's adoption as easy and transparent to the user as possible. It's too early to say how widely casual encryption use will spread, but it isn't too early to see that the shift is both profound and irreversible.     --digsig

It has nothing to do with crypto, but a great deal to do with Usually the transfer of value ultimately results in an adjustment in the ledgers of the federal reserve -- the receiving bank goes up slightly, the sending bank goes down slightly, and the traceability follows from the fact that the transaction ultimately goes through the federal reserve.  The FRN numbers are a backup system to trace people and banks who try to bypass this.
A gold transfer does not go through the federal reserve.

in 1958 pro soviet socialists gained ascendency in Iraq, but a
power struggle proceeded between the communist and baathist
wings of the socialist movement.  In 1963, the baathists
launched a coup, intended to be launched simultaneously in all
arab countries, to establish a united supranational arab state
based on the arab race and socialism. The coup succeeded in
Syria, succeeded only temporarily in Iraq. Allegedly this coup
was supported by the CIA, but there is no evidence for this,
nor does it seem very believable that the CIA would wish to see
the arabs united under a pan arab socialist regime.
Shortly thereafter there was a counter coup against the
baathists in iraq, which established a conventional military
regime, whch was eventually overthrown by Baathists in 1967.
If the CIA gave support to either coup, which one do you think
it more likely to support?
The trouble with your account of events is that the baathists
were then as they are today socialist, pan arabist, anti
american and anti colonialist, hence improbable as
beneficiaries of CIA benevolence.

This is the same problem as occurred when the Westphalian state

Although you probably do not know it, you are invoking the
rules of the peace of Westphalia.
The Soviet Union never respected the peace of Westphalia.
After the election of Ronald Reagan, neither did the US, and
the US has never resumed respecting it, so that stuff is
ancient history now.   National Sovereignty, like the divine
right of kings, just is not taken seriously any more, and the
only people weeping big salt tears about its passing are those
who enthusiastically hailed all the Soviet violations of it as
wars of national liberation.     --digsig

You are making up your own history.  When Saddam came to power, he seized western property and murdered westerners, especially Americans, and you lot cheered him to an echo. Saddam was always an enemy of the west, he was never a good guy.  He was at times an ally, in the sense that Stalin and Pol Pot were at times temporary allies, yet somehow I never see you fans of slavery and mass murder criticizing the west for allying with Evil men, by their nature, find themselves in conflict with other evil men for the same reasons as good men do.  Thus evil men and good men will often find themselves in a temporary alliance of convenience against a common enemy, an alliance
that both sides know will end in war or near war fairly soon.
This however seldom leads good men to mistake evil men for
'good guys"     --digsig

Firstly, the US army has not violated the Geneva convention: Saddam was eligible for being shot on sight.
Secondly;  It is being overly sensitive about the feelings of those poor fragile souls that hate us and seek to murder us,
that got us into these trouble. Our enemies take it for
weakness, reasonably enough.  We should make it obvious that
nothing will stop us from striking at our enemies, that we will
cheerfully wade knee deep through blood and the body parts of
innocents to destroy those that threaten us, as the crusaders
waded to the holy sepulchre.
As Bin laden said slaughtering the occupants of the twin towers made them look strong:
: :	"when people see a strong horse and a weak horse, by : :	nature, they will like the strong horse. This is : :	only one goal; those who want people to worship the : :	lord of the people, without following that doctrine, : :	will be following the doctrine of Muhammad, peace be : :	upon him"
To the best of my knowledge, the UN only grants those awards to those who inflict quite extraordinary ruin and horrible destruction on their subjects -- such awards are as infamous and perverse as the UN human rights commission, headed by Libya las time I heard.
The UN is a cartel of governments against their subjects.  Just as a cartel of ordinary businesses requires its members to charge high prices and supply low quality, and grants honor and recognition to those members that charge remarkably high prices and unusually low quality, in the same way the UN grants honor and recognition to unusually destructive episodes of looting and pillaging against formerly prosperous law abiding peaceful The UN was established to protect against direct military conflict, but in ordinary day to day life, peaceful competition is a greater threat to the rulers, for example "harmful tax competition".  One of the major goals of the EU is to restrain 'harmful tax competition".  Similarly one of the major goals of the WTO is to prevent what cypherpunks call regulatory arbitrage.     --digsig

Clay Shirky: tells us "The RIAA Succeeds Where the Cypherpunks Failed"
The Government's failure to get the Clipper implemented came at a heady time for advocates of digital privacy -- the NSA was losing control of cryptographic products, Phil Zimmerman had launched his Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) email program, and the Cypherpunks, a merry band of crypto-loving civil libertarians, were on the cover of the second issue of Wired. The floodgates were opening, leading to...
...pretty much nothing. Even after the death of Clipper and the launch of PGP, the Government discovered that for the most part, users didn't want to encrypt their communications. [...]
In response to the RIAA's suits, users who want to share music files are adopting tools like WINW and BadBlue, that allow them to create encrypted spaces where they can share files and converse with one another. [...] Note that the broadening adoption of encryption is not because users have become libertarians, but because they have become criminals; to a first approximation, every PC owner under the age of 35 is now a felon.
And the second effect, of course, is the long-predicted and oft-delayed spread of encryption. The RIAA is succeeding where the Cypherpunks failed, convincing users to trade a broad but penetrable privacy for unbreakable anonymity under their personal control. In contrast to the Cypherpunks "eat your peas" approach, touting encryption as a first-order service users should work to embrace, encryption is now becoming a background feature of collaborative workspaces. Because encryption is becoming something that must run in the background, there is now an incentive to make it's adoption as easy and transparent to the user as possible. It's too early to say how widely casual encryption use will spread, but it isn't too early to see that the shift is both profound and irreversible.     --digsig

True, but amongst the vast mass chanting Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh,  one could no more discern principled opponents of the Vietnam  war, than one can today discern principled opponents of the  Iraqi war among the Americans worrying about poor little  victimized Saddam, and the mass of Europeans jumping for joy  over the fall of the two towers.
Amidst the pro Saddam posters on this thread, many have come  rather close to chanting "Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh" -- for the  example the argument that the evil CIA deprived the third world masses of their beloved socialism provided by benevolent  dictators, and the argument that the US "created' the Afghan  resistance -- and thus presumably every other resistance  movement against the Soviets.
Now I get to call you the pinko:
They were supposedly supporters of the NLF, which they well  knew was a North Vietnamese sock puppet, and thus a KGB sock  puppet.  And when that sock puppet was discarded to reveal the iron fist of the NVA that had been moving its lips, none of  them were surprised or dismayed.   Similarly Jane Fonda was supposedly not a supporter of the North Vietnamese qua North Vietnamese, yet without hesitation she lied about the condition and treatment of the POWs she met, whom she depicted as leniently treated war criminals.  When some of those she lied about returned home to speak the truth, she stuck to her position, counter attacking them as hypocrites and liars, denying that they had shown signs of starvation and torture.
I find it strange that the speakers at your rally were so  remarkably different from the speakers at my rally --  particularly when so many of the pro Saddam posters in this  thread sound like they are new nyms for the same people who  spoke at my rally.
If any of your speakers really thought the NLF was something  other than a KGB sock puppet, they would have had posters of  the supposed NLF leader on their wall.  Instead, not one of  these supposed supporters of the NLF blinked when the most of  the NLF vanished in the 1975 purge.

He may not be related to the terrorists, but his fans are related to the terrorists.
The title of this thread is "I am anti war, you stupid evil scum are pro saddam."
I do not support the invasion.   I am not making up pretenses for the invasion.
This is war.  Rule of law does not apply.  Rules of war do apply.  And rules of war say that the US army can not only give Saddam a dental examination, it can nail Saddam's head to a post in Baghdad with a nine inch nail, because he was captured out of uniform, administering the war effort while hiding amongst civilians.
Handing him to the ICC is not fine, because the ICC is not going to execute him, and because the ICC is farcically incompetent, and because the ICC is dominated by the same tyrants who dominate the UN human rights commission, who might well choose to let him off.
When I see how many people want to get him off, I more and more think the the USG needs to kill him quickly.  The longer he lives, the greater the likelyhood that his international pals will pull him out of trouble, and eventually return him to The Nuremberg trials were held in Germany by the victors.

It was an unwise war fought by unjust means.  The cause of saving the Vietnamese from Soviet domination was a just cause, as the terror and the flood of refugees that followed the defeat of the west in Indochina proved.   However, "just cause" is only one of the several criteria needed for a just war.
(And the Iraqi war does not satisfy all the criteria of just
war either, though hanging Saddam is surely a just cause.)

It was an unwise war fought by unjust means.  The cause of saving the Vietnamese from Soviet domination was a just cause, as the terror and the flood of refugees that followed the defeat of the west in Indochina proved.   However, "just cause" is only one of the several criteria needed for a just war.
(And the Iraqi war does not satisfy all the criteria of just
war either, though hanging Saddam is surely a just cause.)

If you call for the release of Saddam, or you justify 9/11, as the "anti-war" posters in this thread have  been arguing, then indeed you are with the terrorists.
You are stupid evil, and a loser.
A popular anti-colonial nationalist movement which he led from Moscow?   Somehow I seriously doubt that Stalin's Moscow was the place to find nationalist movements, let alone popular When Ho came to power in North Vietnam, he treated the population as though they were the enemy, and himself the quisling leader of a hostile alien occupation force.  In his terror against the Vietnamese, he set execution quotas.  His servants had to kill such and such a number of "class enemies" in each village.
I deleted most of your lies without comment, as too obvious and stupid to merit rebuttal, but this lie, though equally obvious and equally stupid, is significant, as it links the fans of Saddam, with the fans of Stalin and Soviet expansionism.
You accuse the US of not merely being allied to bin Laden, but of "creating" him, which presupposes that the US created the Afghan resistance, and indeed every resistance to Soviet Hey, if it had not been for that nasty CIA the afghans would have been happy as pigs in mud enjoying the vast benefits of being uplifted by the Soviets to the superior level of civilization enjoyed by the beneficiaries of Soviet alliance
That is a lie we have heard over and over again, with thirty different wars of Soviet aggression, starting in the 1920s.  We heard it most infamously uttered against East German resistance, and every time we heard that tired old lie, those servants of tyranny uttering it were less believable, and less oh come on.
The Baathist coup was part of a pan arab conspiracy for simultaneous coups in all major arab countries, to create a united pan arab socialist government modelled on Stalin's dictatorship, which would supposedly make the arabs strong in the way that Stalin had supposedly made the Soviet Union It is plausible that the CIA might support an ordinary military coup against a pro Soviet tyrant, but it is unbelievable that the CIA would support a pan arabist coup, intended to unite the arab world and subjugate the drunken fat princes of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, etc.
Plus, if you really believed that Saddam was a CIA agent, how
come you are calling for him to be released, or turned over to
the questionable justice of his fellow tyrants and mass
murderers running the court in the Hague?     --digsig

I am anti war.  You lot are pro Saddam.
Back in the sixties, there were lots of good reasons to oppose
the Vietnam war, notably that it was fought by conscription,
and that McNamara's search for measures of war fighting
efficiency and to create incentives for efficient production of
war effort were demoralizing the troops, and instead of
creating incentives to fight effectively, created perverse
incentives to commit mass murder in place of killing the enemy.
But instead the opponents wound up chanting 'ho, ho, ho Chi
Minh" Ho Chi Minh was a senior KGB agent, who after spending
ten years behind a desk in Moscow organizing the murder of
Indochinese nationalists was sent from Moscow to rule what
became North Vietnam.  He purged 85% of the communist party,
murdering a large but unknown proportion of them, and conducted
a terror against the peasants of extraordinary savagery.
And now the guys on this list are weeping big salt tears about
poor victimized Saddam.
Anyone who opposed the war on Vietnam should have started off
by asking "How shall we contain the Soviet Union and eventually
defeat communism, and what is wrong with the way this
administration is doing it.
Similarly anyone who opposes the war in Iraq should start by
visualizing himself as the heir of  King John Sobieski, not the
heir of Saladin.  Anyone opposing the war in Iraq needs oppose
it from the point of view that Americans and their way of life
should win, deserve to win, and the raghead fanatics should
lose, and their way of life perish.
Anyone who wants to argue that the guys in the two towers had
it coming, and poor Saddam is a victim, puts himself in the
corner with the people who are stupid, evil, and losers.     --digsig

Considerably less than three thousand.  And "we" did not kill them.  The Israelis did.  There are lots of states worse than Israel -- Iraq for one.
In particular, the people in the two towers did not kill them.
If Palestinians had bombed the white house or congress, that might well have been just.  But Bin Laden's boys were children
of wealth, power, and privilege.  Even if they had been bombing Washington, they did not have just cause.  And they were not bombing Washington, they were bombing the two towers.
The 9/11 terrrorists were not Palestinians.  They were not avenging Israeli dispossession of Palestinians, and had they been, they would have been hitting the wrong target.     --digsig

Not a straw man.  Those who think poor little Saddam was a victim, for the most part also think that the US 'created" the afghan resistance, and, particularly if they were European, think the that Americans had 9/11 coming to them.
Saddam was not behind the 9/11 attack, but he was and is allied with those that were, and, the point of my argument, western socialists allied with him and them.  Bin Laden, in obviously violation of the Koran which mandates capitalism, has taken socialism on board, Saddam, originally a secularist, has taken Sunni Islamicism on board, bridging what small ideological gap there was between him and Bin Laden, and western socialists are alarmingly willing to overlook the arabism and islamicism of the few remaining socialists in power.
During the invasion of Iraq, most of the arab news feeds, or at least their corresponding english language websites, were reasonably fair and balanced, while the BBC went over the top with Saddamite propaganda.  When I read the Al Jazeera web site, most of the entirely over the top propaganda came from western correspondents.  Al Jazeera's own correspondants were for the most part OK.
The western intellectuals are not reacting to this as a war of caucasians vs semites, but a war of ideologies -- German originated ideology vs English originated ideologies, with Saddam and Bin Laden incarnating Heidegger and Bush incarnating Locke.   Very likely Saddam had nothing to do with causing 9/11, but Chomsky and the BBC did have something to do with causing 9/11.
When one sees someone arguing that Americans had 9/11 coming,
he frequently starts quoting improbable "facts" that originate from Chomsky, and backs them up with one of the nuttier BBC correspondents.     --digsig

It is mighty hard to take guns from anybody but Stalin when you
are working in Moscow 9 to 5 for Stalin.
He worked behind a desk in Moscow for over ten years in a very
senior position, which suggests he joined the KGB as a field
agent much earlier.
Kind of odd behavior for a nationalist.
If you are looking for a nationalist leadership, Stalin's
Moscow was not the place to find it.
Containment was a catastrophe from the beginning.  The US
government should have done what the communists accused us of
doing, and provided aid to the resistance in East Germany
shortly after Stalin launched the cold war, and aid for the
anti communist resistance in China when the true nature of
Chinese 'land reform" became apparent.
Containment is a strategy that requires one to win or draw
every time, at places and times of the enemies choosing.  The
US army did not win every time, and Vietnam was a bad place and
With roll back, one could lose some, lose most, or even lose
all, and if one launched more wars than the Soviet Union could
afford, would still win the overall struggle.   Indeed,
arguably this was what happened during the second Reagan term.
The Soviets were not losing anywhere -- but could not afford
it.     --digsig

You were already in a frenzy of rage before I accused you of weeping big salt tears for poor little victimized Saddam.
My position on the Vietnam and Iraq wars is the same as that as the mainstream left of the Democratic party (or at least the same as the position they will be holding once the primaries are over), yet you reacted as if I had called for everyone like you to be gassed.
The position you purport to hold is almost indistinguishable from my own and that of the Democrat party mainstream -- but that is not the position implied by your arguments, nor does it correspond to the emotions you express.   Sometimes the position nominally taken by leading Democrats fail to correspond to the arguments and emotions they express also -- Dean has caught some flack for that -- but the discrepancy in your case has is far more visible than that of Dean,    You will not catch Dean weeping big salt tears for Saddam, nor see him deeply shocked by the prospect that Saddam will be tried by his victims. and Dean has a legitimate excuse for his
comparativelyt mild hypocrisy -- he is upset about the the
impact of the coming execution of Saddam on his election
campaign, not about the impact on the prospects for a world of

With modern CPUs one needs a great deal of care installing the heat sink to avoid overheating.   A standard CPU fan is not equivalent to a competently built computer.
A modern bios has the capability to switch the computer off if it detects overheating.  Unfortunately this capability is often off by default, or is deliberately switched off by shoddy assemblers who do not care whether they have installed functional CPU cooling -- and they usually have not.
I recently built a computer for my son.  Went through two CPU cooling systems before I got satisfactory cooling with the third system   Then after the a few months the rather small and fragile plastic motherboard clip that held the extremely massive cooling system against the CPU cracked, impairing cooling efficiency, and I had to take the system apart and McGyver a clip out of inductor wire.  Since it has worked fine. Modern cpu cooling systems are so massive that we need metal to metal clips all the way through the mother board, but today's motherboards still come with these frail little crappy plastic clips suitable only for old style fans.

The Soviet Union was notorious for absurdly low pay, yet had no
difficulty getting lots of servants.
It cultivated a sense of identification.   The CIA would give
you a crate of money, a crate of guns, and some say a crate of
cocaine.   but the KGB would ask about your dental problems and
arrange for a free dental appointment.  If you were a key
scientist or something, rather than just some regular guy, they
would discover your sexual tastes or your tastes in art and
send around a girl or boy to suite, or some art that probably
could not be obtained by mere money, or perhaps a boy carrying
some art.  To the best of my knowledge no one EVER got any

As I predicted, transactions are increasingly going on line.
And as Hettinga predicted, the more anonymous and irreversible the transaction service, the cheaper and more convenient its services.  All happening as predicted.
So why don't we have anonymous chaumian cash by now?
Because, the more anonymous and irreversible its services, the more fraudsters use it to convert other people's bank accounts, obtained by phishing, into usable money.
Why don't we have anonymous e-cash? - because IE and outlook express are full of massive security holes, and because people are idiots.  Observe Tim May, who mistook e-gold phishing spam mail for the real thing.  Well, not so much that people are idiots, but that we still have not got a satisfactory security model that adequately accommodates human factors.

discriminate against the more cashlike forms of internet money.

Firstly, much of the Taliban is Pakistani, not Afghan.
Secondly, if the Taliban were legitimate, their enemies may
lock them up for the duration of the war as POWs, Since some
elements of the Taliban have not laid down their arms, Taliban
prisoners may held for the duration, as POWs, even if they
fought in a manner equivalent to fighting in uniform.
The Taliban were illegitimate, not on legal grounds, but
because they were evil.
 If someone was in the Taliban, then those threatened by the
Taliban have a strong case for locking him up, just as we
locked up nazis. Thirdly a government that systematically
depopulates large areas of the territory it supposedly rules is
not as legitimate as warlords with genuine local roots and
traditional authority, who for the most part came to power
through religious or military leadership in a spontaneous
revolution against tyranny.  No one in the Northern alliance
ever controlled territory though ethnic cleansing.
I can easily imagine circumstances where ethnic cleansing is a
legitimate response to an intransigent enemy with strong roots
in the local population - but the fact that the Taliban used
such measures shows they did not have strong roots in the local
population.     --digsig

Most of them were non Afghans in Afghanistan in the middle of a war and no plausible explanation of their presence, which makes it fairly certain they had signed up Bin Laden and company.  So if they had not personally targeted women and children, they had signed up with an organization that they know rapes and murders.   Don't give me that moral relativism crap that their view of themselves as heroes is as just as valid as our view of them as vicious subhuman monsters.
Different rules apply in war.
Now if the president got away with the principle that an "enemy combatant captured in time of war" is anyone the president designates as an enemy combatant, *then* I would be worried about the fact that they did not get trials and all that.
In a guerilla war or terrorist war, war rules are even more dangerous to liberty than usual since the battlefield is everywhere.   However in this case the application of the rules of war, rather than peace, is legitimate.  They are for the most part foreigners picked up in Afghanistan, where the usual wartime rule is that if you cannot give a plausible account of yourself, they will skin you.
While we should be very concerned that the chronic war on terror may lead to rules of war extending to everyday life, rules of war are still necessary to deal with large scale enemies with the capability to control territory and exclude the forces of justice.  We should not apply rules of war to some terrorists snatched in New York - that would be dangerous to the freedom of the ordinary New Yorker, but if the government snatches terrorists in Afghanistan or near Fallujah, rules of war should apply.

US government meddling in the middle east was unwise and unnecessary, but it did not provoke, nor does it justify, this The intent of a large minority of muslims was to start a holy war between the west and Islam, and the majority of muslims lack the will or courage to stop them, or even criticize them. That was not the intent of Americans, or the American government.  They started it, they meant to start it. Americans
tried to avoid it, some of them are still trying to avoid it. All Americans are still trying to conduct the war on the

Lots of murderous terrorists have been released from Guatanamo, and in the nearly all cases the most serious of their complaints make it sound like a beach resort, except for the fact that they could not leave.
A few have more serious complaints.  Either they are lying or, those who say they were well treated apart from being held captive are lying. It is hard to believe that people like Slimane Hadj Abderrahmane (who after release announced his intention to resume terrorist activities and that he would
attempt to murder his hosts who lobbied to get him release) are
lying to cover up torture by the US army.

If only it were true.  That is why I recommend readily achievable goals, like stealing the oil, rather than goals that require direct involvment mano a mano.
But in reality, the US government is pursuing goals such as "building democracy" that require Americans to walk the streets of Baghdad, a daily exercise of tremendous courage.
Here is my prescription for winning the war on terrorism
We SHOULD rely on shock and awe, administered by men in white coats far from the scene.
A number of governments are disturbingly tolerant of terror. Usually they are only tolerant of terror against their non Islamic subjects, and disapprove of external terror committed by their subjects against outsiders, but the two cannot readily be separated.  One leads to the other.
The US government should expose and condemn these objectionable practices, subvert moderately objectionable regimes, and annihilate more objectionable regimes.  The pentagon should deprive moderately objectionable regimes of economic resources, by stealing their oil, destroying their water systems, and cutting off their trade and population movements with the outside world.
Syria should suffer annihilation, Iran subversion, Sudan some combination of annihilation and subversion, Saudi Arabia and similar less objectionable regimes should suffer confiscation of oil, destruction of water resources, and loss of contact with the outside world.     --digsig

Terrorists seldom engage in basic military violence, which
requires courage.
For example one of those released from Guatenamo captured
several chinese foreign aid workers working in Pakistan,
threatening to murder them:
What Al Quaeda and the Taliban do is terrorism.  What the
Northern Alliance does to stop them is not terrorism.  When did
the Northern alliance massacre civilians in territories it
controlled, launch car bombs in market places, and so on and so
These guys prefer to shoot at children.

When e-currency handlers (cambists) are accused of money laundering terrorist's money, the feds steal the money, but they do not obstruct them from travelling, or, surprisingly, even from doing business - well, perhaps not so surprisingly, for if they stopped them from doing business there would be nothing to steal.
When the state uses repressive measures against those that seek to murder us, there is still a large gap between that and using repressive measures against everyone.
We are not terrorists, we don't look like terrorists, we don't sound like terrorists. Indeed, the more visible real terrorists are, the less even Tim McViegh looks like a terrorist and the more he looks like a patriot.
When people are under attack they are going to lash out, to kill and destroy.  Lashing out an external enemy, real or imaginary, is a healthy substitute for lashing out at internal enemies.  We do not have a choice of peace, merely a choice between war against external or internal enemies.   Clearly, war against external enemies is less dangerous to freedom.
War is dangerous to freedom, but we do not have a choice of peace.  The question is where the war is to be fought - in America, or elsewhere.  War within America will surely destroy What we need to fear is those that talk about the home front and internal security, those who claim that Christians are as big a threat as Muslims - or that black Muslims are as big a
threat as Middle Eastern Muslims.     --digsig

They are more evil that we are, as demonstrated by their propensity to kill all sorts of people, including each other, and including us. This forces us to do something violent. Imposing democracy on Iraq at gunpoint was probably a bad idea, but it was selected as the option that would raise the least objection.  Any more effectual measure is going to piss you lot off even more.  A more effectual measure and considerably less costly measure would have been to confiscate Iraq's and Saudi Arabia's oil reserves, and ethnically cleanse all male muslims above the age of puberty from the oil bearing areas.  This democracy stuff did not work in Haiti and things look considerably more difficult, and more expensive, in Iraq.     --digsig

Has anyone who does not look a terrorist done a suicide mission outside Israel or Russia? Recall the shoe bomber.   You just
had to look at him. You would think the airport screeners would
need to be half brain dead to let him on the plane.  Come to
think of it, they are half brain dead, but laws that require
them to pretend to be stupider than they actually are do not
Just don't let anyone who looks like the shoe bomber fly. Problem solved.  A restaurant should be able to turn away those whose looks they do not like, and an airline likewise.
There are probably a few innocents in Guantenamo, but they released at least one Al Quaeda terrorist who promptly got back in business murdering large numbers of people, and was caught doing it - so presumably they have released lots of others who have committed lots of murders, and not been caught doing it.
Anyone who was non Afghan and in Afghanistan in the middle of the war without a good explanation should have been executed by the Northern Alliance or imprisoned permanently in Guatenamo.

We saw that when the Soviet Union fell, the US lost interest in central America, and peace and democracy broke out in central America with the victory of those forces that had formerly received US backing, and the defeat of those forces that had formerly received Soviet backing, showing that US meddling in central America, was, as it was claimed to be, a defensive response to Soviet meddling, a defensive response that had the support of the people of central America, and that the suffering of central America was in substantial part caused by Soviet meddling.
Sure they don't trust us, but observe that in the Afghan election, Karzai got 56% of the vote, and the soft-on-the-taliban guys got much the same vote as the supposed representatives of the oppressed masses in Central America - down in the asterixes.

Mass movements of this kind require the promise of inevitable
victory. When communism suffered one decisive, uncomplicated,
unambiguous defeat, the dominos fell one after another all the
way to Moscow.  The remaining communists have made some
psychological recovery - see for example Tyler Durden's
peculiar version of recent history, where in his universe the
communists actually won and are still winning, and similarly
the Islamists have made a considerable psychological recovery
from Afghanistan, but the ideal of date with destiny tends to
lose its appeal when you keep picking yourself off the dirt
with a bloody nose.
In Iraq we face a guerrila movement, and discover, yet again,
that guerrilas can only be defeated by local forces - and the
boys from Baghdad are not all that local.  This gives the
Islamicists renewed hope.
So what do you do, if, like Israel, you face terrorists
embedded in a local population that supports thems sufficiently
they can melt into the people?  Withdrawal did not work, for
the terrorists keep sending car bombs and the like from their
stronghold, as in Fallujah.
What worked in Afghanistan was to find some local warlord we
could live with, someone in no hurry to get his six pack of
virgins, someone who might want to put sacks over the heads of
the women of his town, but had no grandiose ambitions to stuff
all the women of the world into bags, and then we cut a deal
with him - we help him his slay his enemies, he helps us slay
our enemies.
Unfortunately the US plan to bring democracy to the middle
east, and to preserve Iraq as a unitary state, keeps getting in
the way of this sort of deal.     --digsig

Bin Laden's intent was to make anyone in America afraid - thus the use of airliners, rather than truck bombs.   McViegh's intent was to make BATF afraid.
Analogously, in Iraq, the murder of schoolchildren for accepting candy from Americans, the use of children as human If group A, acting as an organized cohesive entity with single central will, makes people belonging to group B rationally afraid by violent and evil acts, and someone in group B strikes back at group A in order to make group A afraid to do wrong, this is not terrorism, even if innocents happen to get in the way. If instead he goes after the guy who washes the windows
for someone in group A, and the friend of the little sister in someone in group A, and the child who smiled at someone in group A, this is terrorism.     --digsig

Terrorist:  One who uses terror as a means of coercion.
The word was originally coined to describe the committee of
public safety created by the french revolution, and was
subsequently used to decribe similar regimes, most of them
revolutionary, for example Lenin's.  However it is equally
applicable to non government groups who use similar measures. The difference between guerrilas and non government terrorists
is that terrorists target random innocents - for example
blowing up schoolchildren for accepting candy from US soldiers,
as recently happened in Iraq.  Similarly the deliberately
capricious executions by most communist regimes, intended to
produce a sense of fear and helplessness in their subjects.
McViegh did not target innocents.  Bin Laden did target
innocents.     --digsig

There are however some bad people, who want to conquer and
rule.  Some of them are nastier than others.  Those people need
to be killed.   Killing some of them is regrettably
controversial.  Killing terrorists should not be controversial.

For all that is wrong with the US government, remember the condition  of people under the great majority of the world: poverty and fear, where the political privilege of a few shatters the economy and forces the vast majority into poverty, for example India, Burma, Nigeria, Vietnam, Pakistan, Cuba Indonesia, and all the rest.

This used to be a self flattering delusion, is now a lie. US
records have been opened, we know that the overthrow came as a
complete surprise to the US, and that initially the US did not
know whose side Lon Nol was on.
What happened was that Sihanouk's allies, the North Vietnamese,
attacked him.   This discredited Sihanouk's foreign policy, and
Sihanouk himself, and led to those who sought to save Cambodia
from Vietnamese domination, sought to avoid the installation of
the (then seemingly puppet) Khmer Rouge, overthrowing Sihanouk.
Shawcross, no friend of the US, reluctantly conceded this after
doing a big freedom of information thing.
You live in a world of delusion.  Your dates are all wrong,
your events are all fiction.
The Khmer Rouge were primarily backed by the Soviet Union at
first.  When it became apparent that they were not the puppets
that those who organized them and initially armed them intended
them to be, they subsequently received more backing from China,
and less from the Soviet Union, but they were brought to power
by support from both China and the Soviet Union.
The US never followed an aggressive policy towards the PRC.
Sihanouk was friendly, indeed abjectly servile, to the North
Vietnamese and the Soviet Union, yet the North Vietnamese
created the Khmer Rouge and attacked Cambodia.
Same thing happened with Laos, where the Americans never got
involved at all to any significant extent.     --digsig

The planet where the Afghans held an election, in which nearly
everybody voted, some of them several times, and the Taliban
were unable to carry out any of the threats they made against
the voters, which indicates that the Afghans have been pretty
efficient in killing Taliban.
The average Afghan warlord is untroubled by any of this crap. He sees someone who looks suspicious, says "Hey, you don't look
like you are from around here.  What are you doing?"  If he
does not like the answers, he brings out his skinning knife,
and asks a few more questions.  If the answers make him even
more unhappy, he hands his skinning knife to the womenfolk, and
tells them to take their time.
The parties that sponsored death squads of Latin America, when
victorious, held free and fair elections, which they won, and
those they had been fighting lost.  The death squads were an
response to Soviet sponsored attempts to subjugate, enslave and
terrorize Latin America, and when the Soviet Union passed, so
did the death squads.

The US never intended to use its military might to defeat an
unconventional enemy.
It intended to use its military might in the entirely conventional way
to destroy or deter governments that foster terrorism, as was
accomplished very successfully in Afghanistan.
Regime change in Iraq was supposed to deter Syria and Iran, but they
have not in fact been deterred.  Saudi Arabia and Libya have been
deterred.  Indonesia has changed its policy on terror, but it is
unclear whether this was the result of the spectacle of Saddam and his

You are quite right, it is unjust that people like Bin Laden are so

confiscate the Middle Eastern oil reserves.

shattered the enemy while suffering casualties of about a thousand,
which is roughly the same number of casualties as the British empire
suffered doing regime change on the Zulu empire - an empire of a
quarter of a million semi naked savages mostly armed with spears.

It is often argued that since war, violence, etc, are public goods,
only a state can efficiently defend against states.  Yet in most wars
since 1980, non state entities have done most of the heavy lifting
-loose coalitions containing many independent groups, for example the
contras, the holy warriors that overthrew the Taliban.
Looking at the events of World War II, it looks to me that it does
indeed require a state to conquer and occupy a hostile government, as
the US conquered and occupied Germany, but the Japanese army was
broken by a thousand small groups.
Defeating a large scale evildoer is a public good - but large scale
evil consists of many acts of small scale evil, and defeating each
particular small scale evil act is a private good.
When it came to the part of the war that was purely a public good,
conquering the German and Japanese homelands, America did indeed bear
almost the whole burden, but when it came to defending Australia
against the Japanese, the Australians bore the major burden, and
similarly for most other battlefields outside of the aggressors'
homelands.  Most German troops died fighting Russians in Russia, not
Americans in Germany. The particular victims of particular Japanese or
German acts of aggression counter attacked those particular Japanese
or Germans attacking them.
National defense, or at least some forms of national defense, such as
destroying Hitler's Germany, is a public good, and genuinely anarchist
societies are apt to under provide public goods.
On the other hand governments tend to provide the wrong kind of public
goods, providing what serves their purposes rather than the supposed
purpose of the public good,  Further, when a government gets in the
business of providing a some supposed public good, it creates a lobby,
which results in the public good being over provided, thus for example
ever lengthening copyright, ever more expansive patents for ever more
trivial "inventions", and, of course, the infamous military/industrial
complex, such as Haliburton.
War, for example destroying Hitler's Germany, is the most plausibly
essential public good, the strongest justification for the state.  But
when we look at the defeat of the Soviet Union, or the defeat of the
Taliban, this argument looks considerably weaker.  The heavy lifting
in those wars was done by loose alliances of small groups, for example
the holy warriors and the contras, which did not rely on a single
large centralized authority to support the public good of defeat of an
oppressive regime.
In the second world war, public good theory would lead us to expect
that the most powerful state, America would bear almost the whole
burden of defeating the threat, and smaller states would hang back and
cheer the winner.
The holy warriors were probably effective against the Soviets because
each holy warrior was defending his home, and each small group of holy
warriors were defending their village. Among the contras, it appears
that the Indian contras defended the Indians against forced
collectivization, breaking up collectives with extreme violence and
killing the collectives functionaries and administrators, often in
disturbingly unpleasant ways, but failed to participate in other
contra struggles.
Thus anarchic forms of society appear to be capable of waging war
defensively with considerably effectiveness, but are considerably less
capable of taking the war to places far away.
This is not such a severe limitation as it might appear, since the
Soviet Union was overthrown by essentially defensive wars, leading to
the dominoes falling all the way to Moscow.
It is the nature of Islam to impose dhimmitude on nonbelievers,
without much regard for official state boundaries.  "Dhimmitude" being
a dangerously inferior status where one's property is insecure, and
women are apt to be raped.  Existing Muslim states often fail to
prosecute crimes against infidels, and when crimes are prosecuted,
penalties are slight.
The West has tried to confine Dhimmitude inside a system of states -
the Muslims can oppress their minorities inside Muslim state
boundaries all they like, but cannot oppress outside Muslim state
boundaries.  This artificial boundary bends under pressure, creating
the conflict we now see.
The anarchic equivalent of the current policy of imperial state
building, would be to enter mutual defense arrangements with dhimmi,
without regard to state boundaries.
The Taliban had imposed Dhimmi status on Muslims they did not agree
with in Afghanistan.  An anarchic America would not be able to occupy
Iraq, nor would it be capable of "building democracy" in Afghanistan,
but it would be able to do the equivalent of sending special forces to
assist the Northern Alliance.

You have this garbled.
According to
by the fifteen hundreds, the very finest armor could deflect almost
all bodkin arrows - but very few could afford a complete set of the
very finest armor - and the battle of Agincourt occurred well before
the fifteen hundreds.
Presumably the armor improved (and became heavier and more expensive)
in response to the battle of Agincourt.

Voting only encourages them.  If you vote for a candidate, and he

voting, have given him a "mandate" for those crimes.
Further, suppose you think, as I think, that candidate A is a lesser
evil than candidate B, but the difference is not much. If you vote for
the lesser evil, you will start to rationalize and excuse all the
crimes he commits, identifying with him, and his actions.

My delusion is evidently widely shared:  I did a google search for legalism.    The first link, and many of the subsequent links, equated legalism with totalitarianism, or concluded that legalism resulted in Pol Pot's goons mostly murdered people by killing them with a hoe, and mostly tortured people with burning sticks.  Does this make Pol Pot's Cambodia not a modern nation state?
What made the Ch'in empire a modern despotism was total centralized control of everything, and a multitude of regulations with drastic penalties for non compliance. Telephones are irrelevant.  It was the liberal use of the death penalty for non compliance, not the telephone, that made it When a provincial commander marched fresh conscripts from place A to place B, he would do it in the time alloted, and be there on the date specified, or the Ch'in emperor would cut his head It is the cut-his-head off bit, and the minute and overly detailed instructions concocted by a far away bureaucracy, that made it a modern totalitarianism.
Analogously, in the recent war, Iraqi troops failed to blow several bridges because they had to wait for orders from Saddam.  Wireless and telephone did not help.
So was the Soviet empire.
So was Stalin's Soviet Empire, and Pol Pot's Cambodia, in the highly unusual sense of "decentralized" that commie/nazis use. Pol Pot's Cambodia was, like Ch'in dynasty china, decentralized in that they had twenty thousand separate killing fields, but was, like Ch'in dynasty china, highly centralized in that the man digging a ditch dug it along a line drawn by a man far away who had never seen the ground that was being dug.     --digsig

Maps near enough.  The Chinese concept of "legalism" is barely
distinguishable from German concepts of communism and nazism.
However Confucianism vs Daoism/Taoism is rather different from what
you would get in the west.  Confucianism is somewhat similar to what
you would get if western cultural conservatives allied themselves with
nazi/commies, in the way that the commies are prone to imagine
conservatives have supposedly allied themselves with nazis.  Taoism
somewhat similar to what you would get if anarcho capitalists allied
themselves with pagans and wiccans, in the way that conservatives are
prone to imagine that they have, though in reality the pagans and
wiccans line up with the greenies and nazis, for the most part.
This is the result of a Chinese heritage of politicide and mass
murder, whereas the west has a heritage of compromise and negotiation.
So in the west, we have ordinary people forbidden from doing banking
stuff, but a pile of loopholes in that law, and we do not have the
death penalty for unauthorized banking, whereas in China, they do have
the death penalty, and despite the death penalty, massive defiance of
the law.

No he does not quote primary and secondary sources.  He purports to

he rarely does, he quotes only very small fragments in elaborate and
contrived false context, often using made up quotes which resemble,
but differ from the original in vital ways.  The "famine" in
Afghanistan is a case in point, which has already been discussed in

Bullshit.  Everyone knew that which the regime decided they

only arguing that Qin's legalism was a different thing than
communism/nazism, you are also arguing that Mao's communism was
a different thing than Stalin's communism.
It was a lot harder to get to Afghanistan from Moscow than to get to any place in China from Peking, yet every Afghan child knew in painfully excessive detail what Moscow commanded them to know, and the regime was partially successful in preventing them from knowing what it wished them to not know.
When, during the great leap forward, Peking commanded unreasonable grain requisitions from the provinces, *all* provinces contributed, and *all* provinces suffered starvation.
It is often said that Mao's famine was an unfortunate accident, while Stalin's famines were intentional, but any differences are merely a matter of greater self deception.  Both did the same things for the same reasons, but Stalin justified his actions by anti peasant rhetoric - "liquidation of the kulaks", whereas Mao justified his action by pro peasant rhetoric, but this is a mere difference in the emphasis in the rationalizations and propaganda, not any difference in means and ends.
Both used ruthless terror to establish extraordinary control over a far flung empire that had formerly been ruled by relatively light hand, and then used that extraordinary control to extort extraordinary resources from the peasantry.  The difference between Stalin's frequent references to the poor peasants (who were supposedly carrying out the liquidation of the kulaks in revolutionary zeal) and Mao's similar references is merely that Mao was more thorough in creating the simulation of a mass movement.     --digsig

That seems improbable:   Qin had a cult of personality, in
which every single person subject to his control had to
participate.   A subject of Qin, like a subject of Mao,  was
more aware of Qin, than he was of his mother and father.
The proposition that the chinese emperors ruled with a light
hand is historical revisionism.  Some of them ruled with a
moderately heavy hand, some of them with an extremely heavy
hand, and Qin was as heavy as it gets.
I did not pack them in to one simplistic grid - I said that
legalism was much the same thing as communism/nazism, whereas
Confucianism is a mixture of that, and also of rule by social
conservatives.  The rule of Qin was very similar to commie nazi
rule.  The rule of Qianlong was substantially different.  Both
were despots, but Qianlong was no totalitarian.     --digsig

Permanent holy war in Iraq would keep them busy and out of
mischief WITHOUT permanent large involvement from American
Plus, of course, they would be pumping oil like mad in order to
fund it.
Finding Al Quaeda is hard.  Nation building is even harder.
Military training covers nation smashing, not nation building.
But arranging matters so that Al Quaeda is busily killing those muslims it deems insufficiently Muslim, and muslims are killing
Al Quaeda right back, seems astonishingly easy.   It is like
throwing a match into a big petrol spill.  Why are American
soldiers getting shot putting out the fire?   Why are Americans
dying to stop arabs from killing arabs? We *want* arabs to kill
arabs.  When arabs kill arabs, we fear that the wrong side
might win - but whichever side wins, it usually turns out to be the wrong side.   If no one wins, no problem.
But we learnt from history.  Europe, and Europeans, did learn
from the European holy wars.
First:  Three cheers for Timothy McViegh.
Secondly, the people who organize large scale terror can be identified, particularly by locals and coreligionists, which is
why they have been dying in large numbers in Afghanistan.

Nonsense.  The ugly thing about the period before Taliban rule
was that the Taliban, or people of much the same ideology,
would persistently destroy murder and rape in order to get
people to submit to their rule.  When opposition largely
collapsed, their massacres did not cease, though their rapes
became more discrete.  Instead, they decided to expand their
terror onto a wider stage.
The war was not warlord vs warlord, it was radical Islamists vs

appetite for terror.

3.  Saddam massacres his people.  The CIA, Americans and America get blamed.

5.  Africans massacre each other in the Congo.  America gets blamed.  (Oddly, for once, the CIA, capitalism, and Jews, are not involved.)

Recently existent neolithic agricultural peoples, for example the New Guineans, seldom had kings, and frequently had no form of government at all other than that some people were considerably wealthier and more influential than others, but they always had private property.
This corresponds to the cattle herding people we read depicted in the earliest books of the old testament.  They had private property, wage labor, and all that from the beginning, but they do not develop kings until the book of Samuel, long after they had settled down and developed vineyards and other forms of sedentary agriculture: Judges 17:6 "In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes"
Thus both our recent observation of primitive peoples, and our written historical record, shows that private property rights long preceded government.
Our observations of governments being formed show that governments are formed primarily for the purpose of attacking private property rights.   You want to steal something like land or women, you need a really big gang.     --digsig

The state was created to attack private property rights - to
steal stuff.  Some rich people are beneficiaries, but from the
beginning, always at the expense of other rich people.
Compare mafia "extortion" with government "taxation".  The
mafia charges are small in proportion as their power is small.
The Gangsta disciples charged drug dealers thirty dollars a
month for protection, and, unlike the state, actually provided
protection.   The mafia cannot afford to seriously piss off its
customers, because there is no large difference between
customer firepower and mafia firepower.  The government, on the
other hand, can afford to seriously piss of its subjects.
The federal government established its monopoly of force by
burning Atlanta and Shenendoah.  Al Capone did the Saint
Valentine's day massacre.  Big difference.
Again, compare the burning of Shenendoah with the Saint
Valentine's day massacre.  There is just no comparison.

Not what I said, though that is one possible way of implementing the proposal.
Another possible way is that the client program hashes the password in one fashion, known to everyone, and in a different way, known to everyone, gives the second hash to the server, which then hashes that in a secret way, and the client program then constructs the secret key from both numbers.
Of course, if the user clicks on the menacing "Advanced custom cryptographic key management" he can construct the key in some other fashion.

A password protocol should have the following properties:

There will be no black market as long as the chinese government is prepared to buy US dollars from all comers at the official rate.  The black market can only happen if they start saying "well, you are just a regular person, not a proper registered business, so we will not buy your dollars, unless you give us a good explanation of how you came to have them."
In my opinion the official chinese rates are pretty much in line with reality, are reasonable and realistic. The chinese government is prepared to buy and sell unlimited dollars at the official rate, because it thinks that dollars are reasonably cheap at the official rate, and they are reasonably cheap, because they can be used to buy stuff that chinese want, and stuff that the chinese government wants.
And if the official rates are not reasonable and realistic, there will be no black market until the chinese government is simultaneously unwilling or unable to buy unlimited dollars at the official price, and also unwilling to change the official price.     --digsig

I have amended the post to read, "the default should not
require any input or clicking or thought from the user"
 "How email encryption should work"
On what basis then do we create the user's key?
If we create it from the password alone, then his
password can be dictionary attacked, so every signed
post reveals his password, reducing, not increasing, his
security.   If we automagically create a secret key
stored on his computer, then when he wanders over to
another computer, his key changes, surprising both
himself and those he corresponds with, resulting in mail
failures.  Hence my proposal that in the default case
the key be created based on a PDM server's reaction to
his password.
If we have message signed by a key based on a secret
file, we should not encrypt by default.  Perhaps the
default reply policy should be set in the accompanying
certificate, and if no certificate, signature implies
very little except message integrity and persistence of
identity - "this message apparently posted from the same
computer as the last message from "
Of course, this could be remedied by explicitly changing
the semantics of petnames, that a petname corresponds to
a particular email address on a particular computer, but
that makes changes of petname too frequent,
unintentional, and to end users, surprising.
James A. Donald:
Ian G
It means whatever the certificate asserts that it means.
If the signature is accompanied by the certificate
described as the default case in my proposal
 "How email encryption should work:"
it means you are receiving mail from the someone capable
of receiving email at the sender's address, rather than
a phisher or a virus working through someone's address
book.  (To conceal the infection, viruses make the
"from" address anything in the address book except the
actual from address.)
This provides some immediate utility to the ordinary
user who does not care or know anything about
cryptography - ultimately resulting in signed email
being privileged in spam filters.  Banks will be able to
send out account information in email without being
blocked by spam filters, or setting up their users to be
scammed by phishers, or to have their identity stolen.
One minor problem with whitelists is that I have
frequently been under massive spam attack by virus
generated email supposedly originating from people I
know.   Aggressive whitelisting is going to lead, is
already leading, to aggressive purloining of social
network information to penetrate the whitelists.
Turning off signing by default may well be desirable,
certainly desirable if one lacks a certificate that
provides added value to the signature - but any key
exchange is clumsy - making signed letters a key
exchange mechanism that is relatively transparent to the
user.  We could have a mechanism whereby the user
explicitly injects the public key into the email,
thereby turning on the encryption default - but this
requires conscious thought, understanding, and effort. I was looking for automatic encryption.  It just works,
so long as both clients are using the same protocol, and
no one has to do anything
If the user is going to send the public key explicitly,
to turn on encrypted communication, then there needs to
be a checkbox "Request encrypted reply" - and if you
request encrypted reply, you automatically send a public
key in the header, but no signature is required.  The
user knows that the only person who can receive his
reply is the person he replies to, but does not
necessarily need to connect that identity to some other
Of course if our goal is not "encrypt everything", but
rather "allow the user to encrypt some few things", then
of course we just use local keys, with no certificate. If there is no certificate, then as you suggest the
signature has no semantics, and should not be presented
to the user as a signature, but merely as message
integrity, and we warn the sender requesting an
encrypted reply that the secret key to read the reply
email is stored in a file in such and such a location on
his computer.
My goal was, however, "encrypt everything", much as
paper letters about my family, my niece, and our holiday
in Hawaii are routinely signed and routinely sent in
envelopes.  Unless we have an "encrypt everything"
policy, our system is only going to provide benefits to
the small minority that understand encryption, care
about it, and think about it - which appears to be a few
dozen, insufficient to support decent software.
We need to provide benefits to the masses, without the
masses needing to understand, think about it, or care.
If the client fails to contact the keyserver, we could
fallback from "encrypt everything using a public key
based on the other guys password strengthened through
PDM", to "encrypt selected messages using a public key
based on the other guy's secret file".
The secret file has a transient identity.  Absent a
(possibly self signed) certificate asserting otherwise,
it is assumed to go away quickly, merely proving that
the reply to one letter can only be read by the same
person who sent the previous letter - providing secrecy
and continuity within a particular email thread, not
lasting and long lived identity, hence no petname for a
key without a certificate.   We don't expect the same
person to hold the same uncertified key for very long,
easy to make, easy to discard, hence of limited value
for resisting viral spam and phishing impersonation
attacks, and for securing identity information sent in
email, which is the main added value we can provide for
Joe sixpack. Burmese freedom fighters are a pretty
limited market.

A google for "naive sign and encrypt" turns out rather
too many hits.  To what are you referring?
Ink signatures are closely associated with the person,
and generally persistent for the person's lifetime.
Computer signatures necessarily less so.
In the default case I describe above, the signature has
the semantics. "This email comes from someone who can
receive email at this address, and he is using the same
password as he did last time you received email from
him." - which should, I think, appear literally in the
certificate, or in url in the certificate referring to a
resource that the email client caches.
I have modified the blog post by adding a paragraph on
signature semantics.

--
In my blog  I post "how email encryption should work"
I would appreciate some analysis of this proposal, which I think summarizes a great deal of discussion that I have read.
Here is how email encryption should work:
    * The user should automagically get his key and     certificate when he sets up the email account,     without having to do anything extra. We should allow     him the option of doing extra stuff, but the default     should be do nothing, and the option to do something     should be labeled with something intimidating like     Advanced custom cryptographic key management so     that 99% of users never touch it.
    * In the default case, the mail client, if there are     no keys present, logs in to a keyserver using a     protocol analogous to SPEKE, using by default the     same password as is used to download mail. That     server then sends the key for that password and     email address, and emails a certificate asserting     that holder of that key can be reached at that email     address.

@_subject: how email encryption should work 
--
In my blog  I post "how email encryption should work"
I would appreciate some analysis of this proposal, which I think summarizes a great deal of discussion that I have read.
    * The user should automagically get his certified     key when he sets up the email account, without     having to do anything extra. We should allow him the     option of doing extra stuff, but the default should     be do nothing, and the option to do something should     be labelled with something intimidating like     Advanced custom cryptographic key management" so     that 99% of users never touch it.
    * In the default case, the mail client, if there are     no keys present, logs in to a keyserver using a     protocol analogous to SPEKE, using by default the     same password as is used to download mail. That     server then sends the key for that password and     email address, and emails a certificate asserting     that holder of that key can be reached at that email     address. Each email address, not each user, has a     unique key, which changes only when and if the user     changes the password or email address. Unless the     user wants to deal with advanced custom options,     his from address must be the address that the     client downloads mail from  as it normally is.
    * The email client learns correspondent's public     keys by receiving signed email. It assigns petnames     on a per-key basis. A petname is also shorthand for     entering a destination address (Well it is shorthand     if the user modified it. The default petname is the     actual address optionally followed by a count.)
    * The email client presents two checkboxes, sign and     encrypt, both of which default to whatever was last     used for this email address. If several addresses     are used, it defaults to the strongest that was used     for any one of them. If the destination address has     never been used before, then encrypt is checked if     the keys are known, greyed out if they are unknown.     Sign is checked by default.
    * The signature is in the mail headers, not the     body, and signs the body, the time sent, the     sender's address, and the intended recipient's     address. If the email is encrypted, the signature     can only be checked by someone who possesses the     decryption key.
    * If the user is completely oblivious to encryption     and completely ignores those aspects of the program,     and those he communicates with do likewise, he sends     his public key all over the place in the headers,     signs everything he sends, and encrypts any messages     that are a reply to someone using similar software,     and neither he nor those he corresponds with notice     anything different or have to do anything extra      other than that when he gets unsigned messages, or     messages with an key different from the previously     used key, a warning comes up  an unobtrusive and     easily ignored warning if he has never received a     signed message from that source, a considerably     stronger warning if he has previously received     signed mail from that source.

Near real time means we have to use UDP or equivalent,
rather than TCP or equivalent, and we have to establish
an approximate consensus, not necessarily the final
consensus, not necessarily exact agreement, but close to
it, in a reasonably small number of round trips.

There are a number of significantly different ways this
could be implemented.  I have been working on my own
version based on Patricia hash trees, (not yet ready to
post, will post in a week or so) with the consensus
generation being a generalization of file sharing using
Merkle hash trees. Patricia hash trees where the high
order part of the Patricia key represents the high order
part of the time can be used to share data that evolves
in time.  The algorithm, if implemented by honest
correctly functioning peers, regularly generates
consensus hashes of the recent past - thereby addressing
the problem I have been complaining about - that we have
a mechanism to protect against consensus distortion by
dishonest or malfunctioning peers, which is useless
absent a definition of consensus generation by honest
and correctly functioning peers.

I don't think your blinding works.
If there is a public record of who owns what coin, we
have to generate a  public diff on changes in that
record, so the record will show that a coin belonged to
X, and soon thereafter belonged to Y.  I don't think
blinding can be made to work.  We can blind the
transaction details easily enough, by only making hashes
of the details public, (X paid Y for
49vR7xmwYcKXt9zwPJ943h9bHKC2pG68m) but that X paid Y is
going to be fairly obvious.
If when Joe spends a coin to me, then I have to have the
ability to ask "Does Joe rightfully own this coin", then
it is difficult to see how this can be implemented in a
distributed protocol without giving people the ability
to trawl through data detecting that Joe paid me.
To maintain a consensus on who owns what coins, who owns
what coins has to be public.
We can build a privacy layer on top of this - account
money and chaumian money based on bitgold coins, much as
the pre 1915 US banking system layered account money and
bank notes on top of gold coins, and indeed we have to
build a layer on top to bring the transaction cost down
to the level that supports agents performing micro
transactions, as needed for bandwidth control, file
sharing, and charging non white listed people to send us
So the entities on the public record are entities
functioning like pre 1915 banks - let us call them
binks, for post 1934 banks no longer function like that.

I am troubled that this involves frequent
retransmissions of data that is already mostly known.
Consensus and widely distributed beliefs about bitgold
ownership already involves significant cost.  Further,
each transmission of data is subject to data loss, which
can result in thrashing, with the risk that the
generation of consensus may slow below the rate of new
transactions.  We already have problems getting the cost
down to levels that support micro transactions by
software agents, which is the big unserved market -
bandwidth control, file sharing, and charging non white
listed people to send us communications.
To work as useful project, has to be as efficient as it
can be - hence my plan to use a Patricia hash tree
because it identifies and locate small discrepancies
between peers that are mostly in agreement already,
without them needing to transmit their complete data.
We also want to avoid very long hash chains that have to
be frequently checked in order to validate things.  Any
time a hash chain can potentially become enormously long
over time, we need to ensure that no one ever has to
rewalk the full length.  Chains that need to be
re-walked can only be permitted to grow as the log of
the total number of transactions - if they grow as the
log of the transactions in any one time period plus the
total number of time periods, we have a problem.

We need a protocol wherein to be a money tracking peer
(an entity that validates spends) you have to be
accepted by at least two existing peers who agree to
synchronize data with you - presumably through human
intervention by the owners of existing peers, and these
two human approved synchronization paths indirectly
connect you to the other peers in the network through
at least one graph cycle.
If peer X is only connected to the rest of the network
by one existing peer, peer Y, perhaps because X's
directly connecting peer has dropped out, then X is
demoted to a client, not a peer - any transactions X
submits are relabeled by Y as submitted to Y, not X, and
the time of submission (which forms part of the Patricia
key) is the time X submitted them to Y, not the time
they were submitted to X.
The algorithm must be able swiftly detect malfunctioning
peers, and automatically exclude them from the consensus
temporarily - which means that transactions submitted
through malfunctioning peers do not get included in the
consensus, therefore have to be resubmitted, and peers
may find themselves temporarily demoted to clients,
because one of the peers through which they were
formerly connected to the network has been dropped by
the consensus.
If a peer gets a lot of automatic temporary exclusions,
there may be human intervention by the owners of those
peers to which it exchanges data directly to permanently
drop them.
Since peers get accepted by human invite, they have
reputation to lose, therefore we can make the null
hypothesis (the primary Bayesian prior) honest intent,
valid data, but  unreliable data transmission - trust
with infrequent random verification.  Designing the
system on this basis considerably reduces processing
Recall that SET died on its ass in large part because
every transaction involved innumerable public key
operations.  Similarly, we have huge security flaws in
https because it has so many redundant public key
operations that web site designers try to minimize the
use of https to cover only those areas that truly need
it - and they always get the decision as to what truly
needs it subtly wrong.
Efficiency is critical, particularly as the part of the
market not yet served is the market for very low cost

A central point will invite attack, will be attacked.
The problem with computer networked money is that the
past can so easily be revised, so nodes come under
pressure to adjust the past - "I did not pay that"
swiftly becomes "I should not have paid that", which
requires arbitration, which is costly, and introduces
uncertainty, which is costly, and invites government
regulation, which is apt to be utterly ruinous and
wholly devastating.
For many purposes, reversal and arbitration is highly
desirable, but there is no way anyone can compete with
the arbitration provided by Visa and Mastercard, for
they have network effects on their side, and they do a
really good job of arbitration, at which they have vast
experience, accumulated skills, wisdom, and good repute.
So any new networked transaction system has to target
the demand for final and irreversible transactions.
The idea of a distributed network consensus is that one
has a lot of peers in a lot of jurisdictions, and once a
transaction has entered into the consensus, undoing it
is damn near impossible - one would have to pressure
most of the peers in most of the jurisdictions to agree,
and many of them don't even talk your language, and
those that do, will probably pretend that they do not.
So people will not even try.
To avoid pressure, the network has to avoid any central
point at which pressure can be applied.  Recall Nero's
wish that Rome had a single throat that he could cut. If
we provide them with such a throat, it will be cut.

This requires that we know, that is to say an honest
well behaved peer whose communications and data storage
is working well knows, what the current best branch is -
but of course, the problem is that we are trying to
discover, trying to converge upon, a best branch, which
is not easy at the best of times, and becomes harder
when another peer is lying about its connectivity and
capabilities, and yet another peer has just had a major
disk drive failure obfuscated by a software crash, and
the international fibers connecting yet a third peer
have been attacked by terrorists.

Which presupposes the branches exist, that they are
fully specified and complete.  If they exist as complete
works, rather than works in progress, then the problem

There is a trade off between timeliness and reliability.
One can make a broadcast arbitrarily reliable if time is
of no consequence.  However, when one is talking of
distributed data, time is always of consequence, because
it is all about synchronization (that peers need to have
corresponding views at corresponding times) so when one
does distributed data processing, broadcasts are always
highly unreliable Attempts to ensure that each
message arrives at least once result in increased timing
variation. Thus one has to make a protocol that is
either UDP or somewhat UDP like, in that messages are
small, failure of messages to arrive is common, messages
can arrive in different order to the order in which they
were sent, and the same message may arrive multiple
times.  Either we have UDP, or we need to accommodate
the same problems as UDP has on top of TCP connections.
Rather than assuming that each message arrives at least
once, we have to make a mechanism such that the
information arrives even though conveyed by messages
that frequently fail to arrive.
 > TCP transmissions are rarely ever dropped these days
People always load connections near maximum.  When a
connection is near maximum, TCP connections suffer
frequent unreasonably long delays, and connections
simply fail a lot - your favorite web cartoon somehow
shows it is loading forever, and you try again, or it
comes up with a little x in place of a picture, and you
try again
Further very long connections - for example ftp
downloads of huge files,  seldom complete. If you try to
ftp a movie, you are unlikely to get anywhere unless
both client and server have a resume mechanism so that
they can talk about partially downloaded files.
UDP connections, for example Skype video calls, also
suffer frequent picture freezes, loss of quality, and so
forth, and have to have mechanisms to keep going

No, it is very attractive to the libertarian if we can
design a mechanism that will scale to the point of
providing the benefits of rapidly irreversible payment,
immune to political interference, over the internet,
to very large numbers of people. You have an outline
and proposal for such a design, which is a big step
forward, but the devil is in the little details.

That is not the question I am asking.
It is not trust that worries me, it is how it is
possible to have a  a globally shared view even if
everyone is well behaved.
The process for arriving at a globally shared view of
who owns what bitgold coins is insufficiently specified.
Once specified, then we can start considering whether
everyone has incentives to behave correctly.
It is not sufficient that everyone knows X.  We also
need everyone to know that everyone knows X, and that
everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows X
- which, as in the Byzantine Generals problem, is the
classic hard problem of distributed data processing.
This problem becomes harder when X is quite possibly a
very large amount of data - agreement on who was the
owner of every bitgold coin at such and such a time.
And then on top of that we need everyone to have a
motive to behave in such a fashion that agreement
arises.  I cannot see that they have motive when I do
not know the behavior to be motivated.
You keep repeating your analysis of the system under
attack.  We cannot say how the system will behave under
attack until we know how the system is supposed to
behave when not under attack.
If there are a lot of transactions, it is hard to
efficiently discover the discrepancies between one
node's view and another node's view, and because new
transactions are always arriving, no two nodes will ever
have the same view, even if all nodes are honest, and
all reported transactions are correct and true single
We should be able to accomplish a system where two nodes
are likely to come to agreement as to who owned what
bitgold coins at some very recent past time, but it is
not simple to do so.
If one node constructs a hash that represents its
knowledge of who owned what bitgold coins at a
particular time, and another node wants to check that
hash, it is not simple to do it in such a way that
agreement is likely, and disagreement between honest
well behaved nodes is efficiently detected and
efficiently resolved.
And if we had a specification of how agreement is
generated, it is not obvious why the second node has
incentive to check that hash.
The system has to work in such a way that nodes can
easily and cheaply change their opinion about recent
transactions, so as to reach consensus, but in order to
provide finality and irreversibility, once consensus has
been reached, and then new stuff has be piled on top of
old consensus, in particular new bitgold has been piled
on top of old consensus, it then becomes extremely
difficult to go back and change what was decided.
Saying that is how it works, does not give us a method
to make it work that way.

You keep discussing attacks.  I find it hard to think
about response to attack when it is not clear to me what
normal behavior is in the case of good conduct by each
and every party.
Distributed databases are *hard* even when all the
databases perfectly follow the will of a single owner.
Messages get lost, links drop, syncrhonization delays
become abnormal, and entire machines go up in flames,
and the network as a whole has to take all this in its
Figuring out how to do this is hard, even in the
complete absence of attacks.  Then when we have figured
out how to handle all this, then come attacks.

So what happened to the coin that lost the race?
On the one hand, we want people who make coins to be
motivated to keep and record all transactions, and
obtain an up to date record of all transactions in a
timely manner.  On the other hand, it is a bit harsh if
the guy who came second is likely to lose his coin.
Further, your description of events implies restrictions
on timing and coin generation - that the entire network
generates coins slowly compared to the time required for
news of a new coin to flood the network, otherwise the
chains diverge more and more, and no one ever knows
which chain is the winner.
You need to make these restrictions explicit, for
network flood time may well be quite slow.
Which implies that the new coin rate is slower.
We want spenders to have certainty that their
transaction is valid at the time it takes a spend to
flood the network, not at the time it takes for branch
races to be resolved.
At any given time, for example at 1 040 689 138 seconds
we can look back at the past and say:
But no one can know who is *it* right now
So how does one know when to reveal one's coins?  One
solution is that one does not.  One incorporates a hash
of the coin secret whenever one thinks one might be
*it*, and after that hash is securely in the chain,
after one knows that one was *it* at the time, one can
then safely spend the coin that one has found, revealing
the secret.
This solution takes care of the coin revelation problem,
but does not solve the spend recording problem.  If one
node is ignoring all spends that it does not care about,
it suffers no adverse consequences.  We need a protocol
in which your prospects of becoming *it* also depend on
being seen by other nodes as having a reasonably up to
date and complete list of spends - which this protocol
is not, and your protocol is not either.

This does not work - your proposal involves
complications I do not think you have thought through.
Furthermore, it cannot be made to work, as in the
proposed system the work of tracking who owns what coins
is paid for by seigniorage, which requires inflation.
This is not an intolerable flaw - predictable inflation
is less objectionable than inflation that gets jiggered
around from time to time to transfer wealth from one
voting block to another.

The trouble is, you are comparing with the Bankcard
But a new currency cannot compete directly with an old,
because network effects favor the old.
You have to go where Bankcard does not go.
At present, file sharing works by barter for bits. This,
however requires the double coincidence of wants. People
only upload files they are downloading, and once the
download is complete, stop seeding. So only active
files, files that quite a lot of people want at the same
time, are available.
File sharing requires extremely cheap transactions,
several transactions per second per client, day in and
day out, with monthly transaction costs being very small
per client, so to support file sharing on bitcoins, we
will need a layer of account money on top of the
bitcoins, supporting transactions of a hundred
thousandth the size of the smallest coin, and to support
anonymity, chaumian money on top of the account money.
Let us call a bitcoin bank a bink.  The bitcoins stand
in the same relation to account money as gold stood in
the days of the gold standard.  The binks, not trusting
each other to be liquid when liquidity is most needed,
settle out any net discrepancies with each other by
moving bit coins around once every hundred thousand
seconds or so, so bitcoins do not change owners that
often,   Most transactions cancel out at the account
level.  The binks demand bitcoins of each other only
because they don't want to hold account money for too
long. So a relatively small amount of bitcoins

If I understand Simplified Payment Verification
New coin issuers need to store all coins and all recent
coin transfers.
There are many new coin issuers, as many as want to be
issuers, but far more coin users.
Ordinary entities merely transfer coins.  To see if a
coin transfer is OK, they report it to one or more new
coin issuers and see if the new coin issuer accepts it.
New coin issuers check transfers of old coins so that
their new coins have valid form, and they report the
outcome of this check so that people will report their
transfers to the new coin issuer.
If someone double spends a coin, and one expenditure is
reported to one new coin issuer, and the other
simultaneously reported to another new coin issuer, then
both issuers to swifly agree on a unique sequence order
of payments.  This, however, is a non trivial problem of
a massively distributed massive database, a notoriously
tricky problem, for which there are at present no peer
to peer solutions.  Obiously it is a solvable problem,
people solve it all the time, but not an easy problem.
People fail to solve it rather more frequently.
  But let us suppose that the coin issue network is
dominated by a small number of issuers as seems likely.
If a small number of entities are issuing new coins,
this is more resistant to state attack that with a
single issuer, but the government regularly attacks
financial networks, with the financial collapse ensuing
from the most recent attack still under way as I write
Government sponsored enterprises enter the business, in
due course bad behavior is made mandatory, and the evil
financial network is bigger than the honest financial
network, with the result that even though everyone knows
what is happening, people continue to use the paper
issued by the evil financial network, because of network
effects - the big, main issuers, are the issuers you use
if you want to do business.
Then knowledgeable people complain that the evil
financial network is heading for disaster, that the
government sponsored enterprises are about to cause a
"collapse of the total financial system", as Wallison
and Alan Greenspan complained in 2005, the government
debates shrinking the evil government sponsored
enterprises, as with "S. 190 [109th]: Federal Housing
Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005" but they find
easy money too seductive, and S. 190 goes down in flames
before a horde of political activists chanting that easy
money is sound, and opposing it is racist, nazi,
ignorant, and generally hateful, the recent S. 190
debate on limiting portfolios (bond issue supporting dud
mortgages) by government sponsored enterprises being a
perfect reprise of the debates on limiting the issue of
new assignats in the 1790s.
The big and easy government attacks on money target a
single central money issuer, as with the first of the
modern political attacks, the French Assignat of 1792,
but in the late nineteenth century political attacks on
financial networks began, as for example the Federal
reserve act of 1913, the goal always being to wind up
the network into a single too big to fail entity, and
they have been getting progressively bigger, more
serious, and more disastrous, as with the most recent
one.  Each attack is hugely successful, and after the
cataclysm that the attack causes the attackers are
hailed as saviors of the poor, the oppressed, and the
nation generally, and the blame for the the bad
consequences is dumped elsewhere, usually on Jews,
greedy bankers, speculators, etc, because such attacks
are difficult for ordinary people understand.  I have
trouble understanding your proposal - ordinary users
will be easily bamboozled by a government sponsored
security update.  Further, when the crisis hits, to
disagree with the line, to doubt that the regulators are
right, and the problem is the evil speculators, becomes
political suicide, as it did in America in 2007,
sometimes physical suicide, as in Weimar Germany.
Still, it is better, and more resistant to attack by
government sponsored enterprises, than anything I have
seen so far.

If there were a hundred or a thousand money issuers by
the time the government attacks, the kind of government
attacks on financial networks that we have recently seen
might well be more difficult.
But I think we need to concern ourselves with minimizing
the data and bandwidth required by money issuers - for
small coins, the protocol seems wasteful.  It would be
nice to have the full protocol for big coins, and some
shortcut for small coins wherein people trust account
based money for small amounts till they get wrapped up
into big coins.
The smaller the data storage and bandwidth required for
money issuers, the more resistant the system is the kind
of government attacks on financial networks that we have
recently seen.

We very, very much need such a system, but the way I understand your proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size.
For transferable proof of work tokens to have value, they must have monetary value.  To have monetary value, they must be transferred within a very large network - for example a file trading network akin to To detect and reject a double spending event in a timely manner, one must have most past transactions of the coins in the transaction, which,   naively implemented, requires each peer to have most past transactions, or most past transactions that occurred recently. If hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions, that is a lot of bandwidth - each must know all, or a substantial part thereof.

If one of the mixers is my own, I know that that mixer is not ratting me One valid mixer in the chain is sufficient to be a serious obstacle to the state.  Two is very serious obstacle.  And chances are that both I and the guy I am talking to are running our own mixers.
I observe that a large part of the world's economy is run though virtual private networks running through tax haven islands.  Looks to me that the horse is already bolting.  Wealthy individuals and big corporations use transferable promises to pay by other wealthy individuals transferred over video conference as money, which hawala like money is difficult or impossible for the state to track.
So for the very rich, particularly wealthy Chinese businessmen located outside of China, the cypherpunk program is becoming real. Unfortunately, it is not becoming real for cypherpunks, who hoped that the white middle class would get in on it.  But *some* people are getting in on it.
Chinese are respectful of authority, and superficially compliant, but they have a long history of quiet evasion and subtle resistance, so are naturally inclined to cypherpunkish solutions.   The growth of China is in substantial part the growth of the economy mediated by virtual private networks.  Much of the Chinese economy, notably real estate development and mining, is transparent to the state and run by companies that legally Chinese, and Chinese in reality, but much of the Chinese economy, notably hi tech, is run by companies that are not legally Chinese, indeed their location is hard to find.

The question is, should we rely on cryptographic enforcement transactions, in which case bitcoin or something like it is a good idea, or state enforcement of transactions, in which case it is a bad idea.
The character of the transactions enforced by the state indicates that something like bitcoin is a good idea.
I am pretty sure that you would find any accurate depiction of those transactions racist and offensive.  Indeed, the reason people find it strangely difficult to accurately report what happened is because race was absolutely central to what happened.  The US government is throwing money at voter blocks defined by race, destroying the financial system in the process.  In other countries, the government is also using the banks to throw money at voter blocks, but for the most part not racially defined voter blocks.

This crisis has a lot to do with the fact that Bitcoin is doing well, and suggests demand for other cryptographic solutions.
As orthodox places to put your money and perform transactions are increasingly suspect, people are now willing to consider unorthodox places to put their money and unorthodox means to transact, when formerly there was really no demand.
Now there is demand.  And that the crisis was caused by regulators is a major reason for that demand.
If crypto's mission is to enable people to sign on to their banks without being phished, then this discussion is wholly irrelevant.
If crypto's mission is to enable people to do transactions without being scammed, then existing scams not employing cryptography are wholly relevant.
If government regulation was ineffectual or actively damaging, then we need cryptographic solutions that provide security in ways that bypass the government and regulators - hence the demand for bitcoin.
If the crisis was lack of wise regulation, then we need a solution in which all transactions are, like paypal transactions and the various cell phone money schemes, rendered visible to authority and traceable.
If the crisis was immoral and corrupt regulation, with politicians directing money to voting blocks and regulators spinning in the revolving door between government and banks, and often changing their hats without even changing their offices, wearing a regulator hat at the same desk where a short time before they had worn a banker hat, then we need a more cypherpunkish solution - such as bitcoin, and there is customer demand for a more cypherpunkish solution.

I checked foreclosures by suburb last time I had this argument:  Back then, in East Palo alto (Black and hispanic) ninety nine forclosures. In Palo Alto west of the freeway, (white upper middle class) one foreclosure.  Similarly for Cupertino (white and asian) and Gilroy (overwhelmingly hispanic)
Therefore, middle class did not irresponsibly use their ever rising home values as an ATM card  Or if they did, they paid up, rather than being foreclosed upon - unless you count as middle class those hispanics with no regular job who were buying upper middle class housing.

If someone mugged you, you were mugged by a non asian minority, probably black, and if someone failed to pay a toxic mortgage in the bay area, he is a non asian minority, probably hispanic.  The street crime problem is a race problem, and the financial crisis in America is a race problem.
People who bought overpriced houses no money down in the Bay area were overwhelming non asian minority, and in the case of hispanics, conformed distinctively to stereotype.
It is probable that they had no idea of the lies that were written on the loan application, which they could seldom read, so one can reasonably argue that the literate and frequently white loan officers were to blame, and the non white illiterates signing the papers were innocent ignorant dupes.  I suppose they often were.  But if innocent, also ignorant - thus stereotypical.  The guy who mugs you is usually a stereotypical black, and the guy who bought an expensive house no money down at the peak of the bubble and never made a payment is usually a stereotypical hispanic.
Those crooked loan officers were frequently white, and those crooked bankers were all white.  But the guys who borrowed the money and never made payment are not white, and are for the most part Hispanic, and for the most part, stereotypical Hispanic.

Those few banks that did not issue liar loans, for example the Bank of Beverly hills, got rated as "Substantially noncompliant with the Community Reinvestment Act", because of "No use of innovative or flexible lending products"
The major source of dud loans to deadbeats was Fannie and
Freddy, which were acting to please their political
constituency but the major private source was Washington
Washington Mutual sincerely believed that pissing away 375
billion on no hablo english cat eating wetbacks was God's
          Porter says that Washington Mutual takes the CRA
          very seriously. But he adds the bank regards the
          CRA as a floor rather than a ceiling. He says the
          company, and its employees, want to surpass the
          regulatory standard for institutions to meet the
          credit needs of their communities. Porter points
          out, for instance, that the bank's $375-billion,
          10-year lending commitment was not necessarily
          dictated by the CRA. ?It was good from the
          company's perspective,? he says. ?It was good from
          the community perspective, and it actually gives us
          a higher bar that we want to achieve.?
          "Helping to build strong, vibrant communities
          wherever Washington Mutual does business is integral
          to the company?s long-term strategy. The Community
          and External Affairs Division oversees all community
          investment and development activities to ensure that
          Washington Mutual fulfills its community goals in
          the most strategic way possible."
And proof that they really and truly believed is that they
did not dump ever single one of these crap loans as fast as
possible.  Although they securitized a lot and dumped a lot
of them on wall street, they kept a lot.
Steve Sailer analyses what went wrong:
Say there are two banks, WaMu and Scrooge-Potter BanCorp. The
latter is owned by Ebenezer Scrooge of Charles Dickens? A
Christmas Carol and Mister Potter of Frank Capra?s It?s a
Wonderful Life. While WaMu is beloved for lending to anybody
with a pulse, Scrooge-Potter BanCorp is widely loathed for
taking a dim view of lending money to likely deadbeats.
They both would like to buy George Bailey?s Bailey Building
and Loan Association. ACORN and the National Community
Reinvestment Coalition announce they will protest
vociferously against regulatory approval of the merger unless
the winner pledges to make $50 billion in minority and low
income loans.
Fearing a debacle of defaults, Scrooge-Potter BanCorp issues
a two-word press release: ?Bah, humbug?. And it drops out of
the bidding.
WaMu announces: ?Well, heck, we?ll promise to lend $55
In fact, because Scrooge-Potter realized its quest was
hopeless, WaMu got Bailey Building and Loan for less than it
would have paid if the government wasn?t biased in favor of
imprudent bankers. This gives WaMu more money to pursue more
Lather, rinse, and repeat. The CRA means that WaMu gets big
while Scrooge-Potter stays small.
Consider the indirect effects on Scrooge-Potter BanCorp. Who
would want to go to work for a bank that can?t make
acquisitions because it won?t play nice with the government
on CRA? Scrooge-Potter can?t buy anybody, it can only be
bought. So, how?s your job security at Scrooge-Potter
looking? Wouldn?t it make more sense to go work for WaMu
The CRA drives the climate of opinion in the entire mortgage
industry. If you wanted to be able to buy other banks, you
had to play ball.
Practically everybody did. Out of the thousands of banks with
federal CRA Performance Evaluations, 496 got the highest
rating of Outstanding, while only five dared to be in
?Substantial Noncompliance?.
The biggest noncomplier: First Bank of Beverly Hills. It had
the kind of business strategy that you?d expect from a bank
with that name: take in deposits from rich people and make
loans to big real estate developers outside Los Angeles.
Sensing the popping of the Housing Bubble coming, it was
pulling it its horns when the government evaluated it. The
feds didn?t like that. (You can read the government?s report
and see if you can find anything shameful about how FBBH did
business. I can?t.)
Over time, the madness infects the entire culture of finance,
as the government labels the prudent bankers automatic losers
in the great game of acquisitions.

What we have now has been tried many times before, and failed many times The gold standard has never suffered the kind of wild alarming fluctuations that fiat currencies routinely suffer.  Gold inflation was always very slow, and gold deflation was always very slow, possibly because people expected the value to remain stable, so in the event of deflation, disinvested in gold and increased their investment in other things, and on gold inflation, vice versa.
The most alarming gold deflation was the long depression, caused by the demonetization of silver and accompanying rise of the value of gold.  By modern standards, it was not even a recession.  The most alarming gold inflation was caused by the conquest of the new world, which resulted in inflation at about 1% per year for about a hundred years.

Monetary value is always speculative.  It depends on the expectation that they will be used as money.
There is a small but not totally insignificant chance that after fiat monies collapse, the world will go bitcoin standard.  There is a large chance that the world will go gold standard.
There are about ten billion ounces of gold in the world, therefore fifteen trillion dollars worth of gold.  This value only makes sense if there is large chance that gold will be money.
There are about three hundred million dollars worth of bitcoins.
Therefore the market is valuing the chance that the world will go to a bitcoin standard at
The current value of gold looks about right to me.  So the current value of bitcoin is also about right - that all the gold in the world is worth about five hundred thousand times all the bitcoins in the world.
Which is probably a fairly conservative estimate for the prospects that the world will go bitcoin.
If the current price of gold makes sense, the current price of bitcoin makes sense.

If browsers and servers supported TLS-SRP, this would set in motion a cascade, as the highest security cases, the people most under attack, would switch to SRP, and in due course every logon would become SRP, much as minority use of ssh eventually led to everyone using ssh, rendering certificates irrelevant except for introduction.

For the entire case turned on the fact that John Doe never

entirely unable to prove the existence of the hidden drive.

Similarly, there is no inner volume on a truecrypt drive until it
is proven that there is, and so you cannot be compelled to produce
a key that has not been proven to exist.

They can have access to the drive.  They can have access to the encrypted drive on the unencrypted drive.  They may *speculate* that there is an inner encrypted drive, but the only way they can find out that it exists is to ask me to incriminate myself.

Surely the core of the ruling is that no one except the
defendant knows for sure whether the key exists, knows
whether there is an inner truecrypt volume or not.  The cross

Truecrypt supports an inner and outer encrypted volume, encryption hidden inside encryption, the intended usage being that you reveal the outer encrypted volume, and refuse to admit the existence of the inner hidden volume.
To summarize the judgment:  Plausibile deniability, or even not very plausible deniability, means you don't have to produce the key for the inner volume.  The government first has to *prove* that the inner volume exists, and contains something hot.  Only then can it demand the key for the inner volume.
Defendant revealed, or forensics discovered, the outer volume, which was completely empty.  (Bad idea - you should have something there for plausible deniability, such as legal but mildly embarrassing pornography, and a complete operating system for managing your private business documents, protected by a password that forensics can crack with a dictionary attack)
Forensics felt that with FIVE TERABYTES of seemingly empty truecrypt drives, there had to be an inner volume, but a strong odor of rat is no substitute for proof.
(Does there exist FIVE TERABYTES of child pornography in the entire world?)
Despite forensics suspicions, no one, except the defendant, knows whether there is an inner volume or not, and so the Judge invoked the following precedent.
That producing the key is protected if "conceding the existence, possession, and control of the documents tended to incriminate" the The Judge concluded that in order to compel production of the key, the government has to first prove that specific identified documents exist, and are in the possession and control of the defendant, for example the government would have to prove that the encrypted inner volume existed, was controlled by the defendant, and that he had stored on it a movie called "Lolita does LA", which the police department wanted to watch.

Bottom line is that the suspect was OK because kept his mouth zippered, neither admitting nor denying any knowledge of the encrypted partition.
Had he admitted control of the partition, *then* they would have been able to compel production of the key.
The court did not concede any right to refuse to decrypt a drive if you admit possession of the contents.
So:  Don't talk to police about the contents of your drive, or indeed anything of which they might potentially disapprove.

When hyperinflation hits, everything becomes money except money.  Nails are money, gold is money, moonshine liquor is money, antibiotics are money.
But when hyperinflation hits, paper is not money.
When that day comes, the problem will not be that bitcoin is cut off from fiat money, but that fiat money is cut off from bitcoin - and perhaps more importantly cut off from nails, from gold, and from moonshine liquor.
The day comes when you offer a trillion dollars for some nails, and no one will sell you the nails because they don't know, and don't much care, whether it is a British trillion or an American trillion, nor whether that makes any difference.
Paper money has been adopted several times over the last thousand years of recorded history.  What do you think happened each of the previous times?
Of course gold has a lot more history behind it than bitcoin, so chances are will go to a gold standard rather than a bitcoin standard.  Everyone knows that gold is money, even African peasants, while only a few geeks think that Bitcoin is money.  But the way the wind is blowing we are going to be off fiat money soon enough.
Supposedly we are wiser now, and can now make fiat money work.  But if you look at the Assignat hyperinflation, they knew how to make fiat money work back then - until they started executing people for suggesting that inflation was happening and that it was caused by the government printing too much money, whereupon everyone who was politically correct forgot how to make fiat money work.
Something similar happened in Weimar Germany.  In Weimar Germany, unlike Revolutionary France, they did not cut off your head for noticing that inflation was happening or explaining what was causing it, but it was extremely bad for your career to notice such things, so all the most learned economists were firmly of the opinion that there was no significant inflation, and that printing more money to provide more welfare was extremely good for the economy, indeed so vitally necessary that there needed to be a lot more of it.  To doubt the consensus was, as Paul Krugman frequently explains, to oppose economics and science.

We did not understand what software was needed, and have not supplied it.
Widespread use of encryption requires end to end encryption.  Mapping names to keys is too much work for the end user if it is additional task on top of doing what needs doing, so people do not bother.
Need a zooko triangle like system in which your key is your ID.
If key is your ID, need a system that substitutes for DNS which maps keys to network addresses.  (Does bitcoin map keys to network addresses?.  I don't think it could work unless it does.)
If encryption is end to end, needs to replace tcp with something built on top of udp which supports NAT penetration.
So need a DNS and tcp replacement.
And, since committees are always a security hole (the committee always comes under hostile state influence) the tcp/DNS replacement needs to have an arbitrary and potentially large number of bits identifying the protocol, instead of being limited to eight or sixteen bits of protocol identification as tcp is, and a potentially multi step protocol negotiation allowing client and server to search for a shared protocol of a class, so that we can avoid the need for an ICANN
ICANN, and the states it represents, was implicit in thirty two bit network addresses and in the eight to sixteen bit protocol identifiers of tcp.

Intel shows a circuit that should in theory output near random bits.  If the bits are actually coming from this circuit, we would expect to see some long term anti correlation - an unusually long stream of zeros should have a higher than random percent chance of being followed by an unusually long stream of ones, and some short term correlation - a zero should have a higher than fifty percent chance of being followed by another zero, and a lower than fifty percent chance of being followed by a one.
If we don't see that, we are not getting the raw unwhitened output, or there is no hardware true randomness for us to get.
Conversely, if we do see that, we can be pretty sure that the circuit exists and is producing true randomness, though of course we don't know if that true randomness is necessarily being fed into the whitener.  But then we don't need to use the output of the whitener, we can feed the off white output into a software whitener.

That is a question a great many people have asked, and we have not received any answers.
Access to the raw output would have made it possible to determine that the random numbers were in fact generated by the physical process described, since it is hard and would cost a lot of silicon to simulate the various subtle offwhite characteristics of a well described actual physical process.

Hard to suppress long strings by an amount that subtly varies
according to temperature and clock speed, and subtly varies
from one chip to the next.  And my reading of the circuit is that
you are also going to have to enhance short strings a bit.

A genuine hardware noise source will show colored noise, which is very hard to simulate in software, and especially hard to simulate at any reasonable speed.
If the entropy source is real, it will show its analog characteristics leaking into the digital abstraction. The correlations and anti correlations between nearby bits will reflect the analog values of the circuit, thus no two chips will show quite the same correlations, and the correlations will vary with temperature and overclocking. These analog variations would be compelling evidence that the entropy source is the claimed circuit or something very like the claimed circuit.
Any Intel misconduct would show up in the color of the noise, it being very hard to create a digital pseudo noise source that displays subtly varying color at high speed, while hardware true random noise sources almost unavoidably display subtly varying noise color.)

As computing power increases, NSA resistant RSA key have become inconveniently large, so have to move to EC keys.
NIST approved curves are unlikely to be NSA resistant.
Therefore, everyone should use Curve25519, which we have every reason to believe is unbreakable.

What went wrong is that all the banks were cuddling up to the regulators and telling the regulators what they wanted to hear, and in particular and especially, Washington Mutual was doing so.
Jim Bell's denial of disservice program is the opposite of cuddling up to the regulators.   Banks that cuddle will be punished, but banks that fail to cuddle will be punished more, thus he is unlikely to get support for denial of disservice, unless he disguises it as some sort of public good program to ensure that black rapists and muggers get off.
Here is a bit of background on the illegal acts committed by Washington Mutual, and how JP Morgan wound up with responsibility for these illegal acts.  I don't know what happened with Bear Sterns.
The law required equal outcomes for blacks, hispanics, and whites.
The law also required that the banks only lend to people with income and savings.  However, banks that followed that law, for example the Bank of Beverly Hills got in trouble because they were violating the equal outcomes law.
To make the regulators happy, Washington Mutual lied that its customers had income and savings.  All the banks lied, some more than others.  The bigger the lies, the happier the regulators.  The biggest liars, and the most blessed by the regulators, were Washington Mutual and Countrywide.
In 2005 November, all the lies blew up horribly in people's faces. However, from 2005 to 2008, the government required a big game of pretend and extend, in which everyone pretended the lies were true.
And, as part of the pretense that the lies were true, even though the shit had already hit the fan, JP Morgan was forced to buy Washington Mutual even though everyone knew that Washington Mutual was a stinking pile of toxic assets.
JP Morgan is now being punished for the lies told by Washington Mutual.

CAs do not work very well, because no one knows or trusts the CA, the CA does not know anyone, and it is a lot jumping through hoops to persuade the CA to trust anyone.

x.509 is evil.
x.509 is designed for universe ruled by a single state, that state the fount of all trust, all nyms, and all relationships.
Reality, however, is that relationships and trust are predominantly peer to peer, thus anything touched by x.509 somehow always develops an absolutely horrid user interface.
When we apply x.509 to a universe far more anarchic than it was designed for, bad things happen to the UI.
What your proposed system intends to provide is reputational information.  You need some entity, a server, likely a tor hidden service, to curate reputational information, and charge a fee for doing so:  You are competing with ebay, whose main asset is their large collection of other people's reputational information.
Let us call such entities, entities that collect and curate reputational information, reputational servers, ebay being the big example of a reputational server.
You would like to be able to transport reputational information, so that it is public domain, not the private property of a given reputation server.  So you don't want reputational information to be information about joe though of course you should present it that way, rather than displaying public key information directly in the UI (employ Zooko's triangle, and never throw 256 bit random numbers in the end user's face)
So, has to be the reputation of the owner of a bitcoin wallet, not the reputation of the owner of x.509 certificate.

The prohibition against unauthorized sources of entropy indicates evil intent and evil deeds.
No source of entropy can ever be harmful. The worst that can happen is that it is entirely predictable to the adversary, in which case it does little good, but can never do harm.
Thus banning unauthorized sources of entropy is an obviously stupid move.

I get the impression that the rate of increase is itself increasing, which projects to a left singularity - infinite legislation in finite time in our near future, but I don't have the numbers to project when the singularity arrives.
Is there any way to find the total amount of legislation in each year?
It used to be that one could know how much regulation by sizing the federal register, but this is no longer the case.  We have already hit the event horizon of regulation, in that the federal register has ceased to have any meaning.  These days most regulations cannot be found in any well defined or meaningful place, and if they could be found it would not be much use, since current doctrine is that regulations are defeated by people merely obeying them, since this always leads to the law of unintended consequences, that mere obedience is a sneaky form of de-regulation.  Rather, those regulated should believe and have faith in the purposes for which the regulations were passed.  As was illustrated with the Bank of Beverly Hills, compliance with regulations no longer suffices: Holiness, faith, and zeal is required.  Ye shall not be saved by works, but by faith.  For Beverly Hills bank, it was insufficient to obey the regulators.  Their staff had to believe in the regulators.
We are close to reaching the same situation in legislation as we have already achieved in regulation, where legislation becomes a form of prayer, as regulation already has, so that the mere words on paper cease to have meaning or effect.

David Petraeus would disagree - particularly as he got nailed for using email from an inappropriate location, not for web browsing from an inappropriate location.  Notice while your link piously gives an innocent explanation for what Firefox is doing with a list of nearby wifi points, your link does not discuss what the hell Thunderbird is doing with a list of nearby wifi points.
The document you cite says that if you OK a website knowing where you are, your browser then sends that website (not Google) your location, which can indeed happen if you fiddle with the settings.  What, however, happens in the default setting, is that if you OK a website knowing where you are, your browser does not send them a list of your nearby wifi points, but instead tells them to request your location from Google.  There seems to be no technological reason why they cannot request your location from Google without waiting for your browser to tell them to do so, though I suppose Google might be displeased.
Which procedure implies that Google already has a list of your nearby wifi points, from which it has already deduced your location.

Of course people usually use Thunderbird on their main computer, which generally does not have a gps, but it usually has a wifi card. Thunderbird detects the nearest wifi networks .
When google does street view for Google Earth, they also detect nearby wifi networks, so the data supplied by Thunderbird is matched against the data collected by google during street view surveys.
Thus, whenever and wherever you use Thunderbird, google can supply the authorities with the closest street address to where you are using Thunderbird, and pictures taken from the street very close to that address.  Thus the authorities not only have your email, which being sent in the clear has no expectation of privacy, but also a picture of building that you are sitting in when sending the email.

If spying on me to protect the population at large (which I violently object to) then should be hitting on non unique urls.

You have to have root access to declare your entropy represents j bits.
If the adversary has root access, game over.  We have to assume that OS writers and system owners are the people we are trying to protect, not the people who are attacking.
The NSA rule is not intended to exclude adversaries, but rather intended to exclude operating system writers who are non NSA.
It is intended to prohibit non NSA sources of entropy.

However, people complain that if any of the existing sources of randomness are fixed to work like that, it is not bug compatible and will break existing software.
So:  Create a new source of randomness, xrandom, which is like urandom, except for the bug.

This was the big problem with Athenian democracy before its defeat in the Pelopenessian wars, the invasion of Sicily being an example of Athenian decision making ruled by short term political advantage without concern for the longer term consequence of catastrophic defeat and enormous loss of life.
Because of this problem, power tends to slide from their hands into the hands of a permanent and unelected elite, which is the situation we now have in America.

The relevant analogy is not that a dam might fail, but that the builders were paid ten million dollars to make sure it failed when the town's enemies wanted it to fail by planting dynamite in the dam.

What he said!
Opportunistic encryption everywhere would force attackers to use
active attacks.  Active attacks can be detected.  Large powerful
organizations are likely to be reluctant to use active attacks too
widely, because they do not want their activities to be observed.  The
more powerful the organization, the more valuable information about
that organization is to its enemies, thus the more costly are active
Thus, if opportunistic encryption everywhere, the NSA would likely
limit itself to active attacks on people named Mohammed.

Much as Henry Louis Gates obviously considered himself the state, and a mere policeman as not the Snowden knew he risked punishment for civil disobedience, and so made his activities as normal as possible, as unobtrusive as possible. Aaron Schwarz did not know, and was so horrified to discover he was not part of the powerful that he followed in the footsteps of his hero Wallace and killed himself.

He needed killing, just as much as Martin Trayvon did, for much the same reasons as Martin Trayvon needed killing.
If an anti state protester, protest state power, not property.  If you are protesting property, you are a pro state protestor
Which is why Schwarz thought he was part of the powerful, and thought those he harmed were part of the powerless.  Because he was striking at physical property, not intellectual property.

A sysadmin tries to keep his systems working.  Aaron Swartz was
disruptively trespassing on their systems - he was arrogantly and
obnoxiously aggressing against them.
And that, in fact, was what he was charged with, not with releasing
JSTOR IP property, but with screwing up other people's computers.
If he had been furtive about collecting the data, the way Snowden was,
there never would have been any problem.
The problem was that Aaron Swartz was an arrogant asshole who thought
he was ruling class and above the law, and that those he aggressed
against were menials beneath the law - the Henry Louis Gates
One of the things our ruling class filters against is conspicuous and
obnoxious arrogance.  They don't want us noticing them.  Aaron Swartz
failed the conspicuous arrogance filter before being granted tenure,
so suddenly found himself no longer ruling class.

Whites report that Indians, when they got the chance, killed a very

side of the Kentucky River from the Indians.  They spent the money in
short order, and having spent the money, wanted the land back,
starting a war against the whites, a war against Daniel Boone and
Colonel Calloway, which turned out to be a really bad idea.
This was the general pattern, repeated over and over, with land
purchases leading to extraordinarily terrible Indian wars.  By and
large, Indian wars resulted from the short time preference of the
Indians relative to the longer time preference of the whites.  Indians
would make bad deals, a lot of land for a little whiskey, then after
the whites arrived and had created facts on the ground, the Indians
would change their minds, even though it was by then far too late to
change their minds.
If the Indians had had reasonable time preference, they would have
been able to hold out for a fair deal, and then stick to it.  Once
whites started to arrive, it was a really bad time for the Indians to
turn around and break the deal, but nonetheless it was usually the
Indians that broke the deal, usually by abducting children, sometimes
by scalping children and burning them alive.  Not only would they
break the deal, but break it at the worst time for themselves, in the
worst way for themselves, and in the most evil and horrible possible

The reason Aaron Swartz was repeatedly detected and repeatedly blocked
was because of the crudity of his attack:(sequential downloads at
maximum  speed, disrupting JSTOR with excessive load)
Had he rate limited his downloads to avoid disrupting the network, and
hidden the sequential nature of his downloads through a random
permutation, he would have been fine.  No one competent to detect him
and block him would have cared enough to do so.

That is the charges against Aaron Swartz.
Libertarians are propertarians.
Property rights are the boundaries between one man's plan and another man's plan.  If the ruling elite casually violate property rights, then, as with Obamacare, the result is chaos, which must be resolved by one plan imposed on all to restore order in order to avoid collapse. Terror follows in due course.  Should the terror ease, collapse follows.

Aaron Swartz was not charged downloading articles without paying, but
with disrupting a network on which his menial inferiors depended.
Illustrating that our masters are incompetent and stupid, as well as
If I had been in the closet and screwed with the network wiring (which
I would not have done since the network was wide open to competent
attack from safely far away) I would have screwed with the network
wiring in such a fashion as to produce no easily noticeable effects.
If I had been doing what Schwarz was doing, I would have proxied
through a bunch of zombies to disguise the IP, would have rate limited
the download so as not to stick out and not produce an obnoxious and
noticeable disruption, and would have done a pseudo random permutation
on the order so that it was not obvious sequential, thus not obvious
the intent was to download the entire database, so that it looked as
if particular specific articles were being downloaded.
And all that would have been overkill, for if no disruption of the
network, no one who had the skills to detect it and do something about
it would have cared.

"On Saturday, October 9, we again detected rapid downloading, this
time at an even faster rate. The downloading overloaded several
servers, disrupting access to JSTOR for users beyond MIT."
What led to his arrest was that he physically entered the building,
and physically entered the closet where their network was connected
up, and physically messed with their network wiring to attach his
laptop Burglary and physical damage.
Which physical damage led to network dysfunction.
Tracing the network failure, the sysadmins found his alterations to
their network, and left the laptop where it was, placing a camera near
the closet to detect the criminal's return to pick up the laptop.
In due course, Aaron Schwarz shows up on video picking up his laptop.
The sysadmins never displayed much interest in the fact that
he had earlier illegally downloaded huge numbers of articles.  They
got pissed, and he got charged, for entering the building and messing
with their wiring.
If he had kept his downloads non disruptive by limiting the download
rate, by being furtive as Edward Snowden was furtive, no one would
have bothered - and proof of this is that they did not bother.
He wanted to smack their faces with the fact that he was ruling class
and they were mere minions, that the laws of the ruling class are
for the little people, not for members of the ruling class.

You are perhaps saying it frequently requires no skill, other than fraud or burglary, to muck up someone else's network.  Indeed it does not.
Nonetheless, mucking up someone else's network by such simple means is hacking in the first meaning of the word, hacking as an aggressive or criminal act.
Because hacking from a distance requires skill, particularly if a network has some halfway competent defenses, the word "hack" has also come to mean some impressively clever stuff done with computers, but the original meaning was simply bad stuff done by computer - and, in the early days of the internet, it was possible to do bad stuff by computer with very little skill.
And even today, it is possible to do bad stuff by computer with very little skill if one physically accesses a network that is not intended or expected to be accessed by outsiders.

The term hacker first appears 1975 - 1985, shortly after the start of the information epoch, the age of information starting by convention 1972 January first.
The term was originally an epithet, but not for criminal behavior:
At that time, 1980, a hacker was someone who programs for entertainment - badly.
In 1983,  a hacker is someone whose interest in programming has damaging consequences for his social life and social skills, but he is a very good programmer.
Then we hear that the original hacker was the phone phreak captain crunch, implying that a hacker is someone who breaks into other people's systems to take control of other people's stuff, generally to give himself free stuff.
"High noon on the electronic frontier", a 1996 book, talks about rehabilitating the term, and complains that "hacker" "carries the image of persons who are dangerous" (page 151)
So, evidently, the term was in need of rehabilitation.
In 1996, esr owns the term, and gives it a positive meaning.
So, hackers were something bad, then something criminal, and then, in 1996, we had a hacker pride movement, with esr as the key figure.
Hence, esr, for all his faults, is generally regarded as the prophet of the programming subculture.
But, before he was prophet, needed his people to be in bondage so that he could lead them out of bondage.

They have been looking for a female pilot for the navy ever since they had aircraft carriers.  In all these years, could not find one, so, under ever increasing pressure to include women, decided to go with Kara Hultgreen, because she was the best, which is to say the least bad they could find.
PC killed Amelia Earhart, and PC killed Kara Hultgreen.

In due course, we will have non flying navy pilots with same uniforms and honors as flying navy pilots, and all the female pilots will be non flying.

In an effort to manufacture a poster girl, Hultgreen was required to attempt to land on an aircraft carrier, and in due course, killed herself, demonstrating why every naval pilot is male.
You can affirmative action women to all sorts of jobs, and furtively have a white male do the actual job, but the reason all naval pilots are males is that when you affirmative action someone to naval pilot and expect them to land on a carrier, they die.  There is room in an office for males to do the actual work, but there is no room in a warplane for a second pilot to do the actual piloting.
You can put girls in the army, and all that immediately happens is that the march slows down, but you cannot put girls in the naval airforce, and make the carriers bigger and the planes slower.  In a plane built for male abilities, landing on a ship built for male abilities, they have to fly like males.  And, of course, they cannot.  They tested her, in testing she repeated made errors that would have killed her.  She was the best female pilot available, so they had her do real landings regardless, so that they could have a poster girl.
Amelia Earhart was initially given a ticker tape parade and a meeting with the president for being flown across the Atlantic like a sack of potatoes by a male pilot, but the cognitive dissonance being too great, such a poster girl attracting ridicule, they eventually had Amelia Earhart and Kara Hultgreen attempt to perform difficult piloting tasks for real, killing them.
In due course we will have female naval pilots with same uniforms as male pilots.  The unisex uniforms will be made girly.  The traditions will be made girlie or abolished.  Male camraderie will be forbidden. References to nuts and bolts will be forbidden as excessively sexist. But the female naval pilots will not actually be required to fly carrier

One way accommodation, wherein men accommodate female differences, but females do not accommodate male differences, is dysfunctional, as demonstrated by Katherine Hultgreen, and also admits the inequality that it denies.
If you call it racism and sexism when characteristically male standards are upheld, this implicitly admits that women are different from men, and therefore in some activities and aspects inferior, while in others, the properly feminine sphere, superior.
If women are equal to men, then they deserve to be called out if they fail to live up to characteristically male standards.
If on the other hand, women are not equal to men, and require special treatment,  then they deserve a condescending pat on the head when they show up in male forums and need to be gently shepherded to a properly feminine environment, where they will not feel so out of place.   You are trying to have your cake and eat it as well, one way equality, wherein women are not only equal to men, but more equal than men.
If you call it racism and sexism when characteristically male standards are upheld, this has the unfortunate result that male behavior gets replaced by female behavior: Whereupon you get Katherine Hultgreen doing an Amelia Earhart.
If feminism is the principle that women are equal to men, cannot be the Katherine Hultgreen/Amelia Earhart principle that women get special treatment to accommodate their failings and weaknesses.
That path does not work.
Characteristically male environments are characteristically male because of characteristically male virtues.  Characteristically female environment are characteristically female because of characteristically female virtues.  If we are to have integration without social decay, then females entering a characteristically male environment need to live up to difficult, stressful, uncomfortable, and unfamiliar standards, as Katherine Hultgreen demonstrated in the most dramatic and terrible possible fashion, and Cari Matchet demonstrated in a more frivolous and amusing fashion.

A corporation is freedom of association, a group of people that agree together to act as one.
In order to act as one, they delegate complete power over the collective assets of the project to one of themselves, the CEO, who is, often one of the major shareholders.  Thus a corporation is people, people agreeing to associate, and corporation is a person, in that the people agreeing to associate commonly nominate one of themselves to be that person.

So total number of tokens issued is correct.
Each unblinded token cashed is added into the Merkle tree.  If not in tree, could be recashed.  So total number tokens paid out on is correct.

You can tell someone's race by looking at their genes more easily and accurately than by looking at their faces.
And by looking at their faces you can frequently make rather good predictions of ability and behavior in certain matters.
Yes, such predictions are necessarily imperfect, but so is every other way of making such predictions.

It is a lot easier, and a lot more reliable, to determine someone's race, than to determine their character.  And their race often gives a good enough prediction of certain important aspects of their character.
In particular, in the events leading to the mortgage meltdown, race was a better predictor of propensity to default on one's mortgage than any of the permissible credit characteristics.
You are walking down a dark street.  Two other people are also walking down that street.  One is a black male, one is a white male.  The black male is quite unlikely to murder you.  But if you are worried about being murdered, and you probably should be, he is one hell of a lot more likely to murder you than the white male.  About thirteen times more likely in fact.
Similarly, if you are a banker who is worried that someone is going to blow off his mortgage ... well doubtless there are a lot of blacks, probably most of those blacks with good credit ratings, who will not blow off their mortgage.  But if someone is black with a good credit rating, he is one hell of a lot more likely to blow off his mortgage than someone who is white with a good credit rating.
The more you know about a debtor, the less is race adds to accuracy of predicting the likelihood of default.  But even if you have complete credit data, race is still substantially predictive.  The chance of a white man and a black man with equal credit ratings defaulting on a mortgage is far from equal.
Similarly, if a white man and a black man both have long and horrible criminal records, they are about equally likely to murder you.  But if a white man and a black man both have minor criminal records, the chance that the black man will go on to commit murder is far from equal.

Races are by definition not distinct.  If they were truly distinct, they would by definition be species, not races.
Races are, as Darwin explained, the origin of species.
Because fertility between kinds gradually diminishes as they become more and more different, and even radically different kinds often have some limited interfertility, there is no sharp line between a species difference and a race difference.
But if interfertility is definitely zero (which is less common than you would think - you can get some mighty surprising hybrids) then it is definitely a species difference.
As Darwin explained, the origin of species is that different races are exposed to different selective pressures, and over time tend to become more different, resulting in gradual diminution of interbreeding and Darwin's account of speciation - that speciation is usually and primarily sympatric - has been confirmed by studies of speciation in fish, in particular sticklebacks, and studies of speciation in The counter theory is Gould's punctuated equilibrium, which is the scientific justification for your pseudo scientific babble.
Gould invented punctuated equilibrium in order to have a pseudo scientific theory proving that all men are created equal, since Darwin's account of speciation implies that the processes that create races create inequality.
So people looked into Gould's theory, and it was disconfirmed, and Darwin's horribly racist account of speciation (that sympatric speciation is normal, gradual, common, and happening everywhere all the time) confirmed - at least for numerous non mammalian kinds.

Darwin discussing whether to classify humans as one species or several:
     We will first consider the arguments which may be advanced in favour of classing the races of man as distinct species, and then and then the arguments on the other side.
     â¦
     The inferior vitality of mulattoes is spoken of in a trustworthy work as a well-known phenomenon; and this, although a different consideration from their lessened fertility, may perhaps be advanced as a proof of the specific distinctness of the parent races.
     â¦
     Now if we reflect on the weighty arguments above given, for raising the races of man to the dignity of species, and the insuperable difficulties on the other side in defining them, it seems that the term âsub-speciesâmight here be used with propriety. But from long habit the term âraceâ will perhaps always be employed.
     â¦
     Through the means just specified, aided perhaps by others as yet undiscovered, man has been raised to his present state. Butsince he attained to the rank of manhood, he has diverged into distinct races, or as they may be more fitly called, sub-species. Some of these, such as the Negro and European, are so distinct that, if specimens had been brought to a naturalist without any further information, they would undoubtedly have been considered by him as good and true species
     Our naturalist would then perhaps turn to geographical distribution, and he would probably declare that those forms must be distinct species, which differ not only in appearance, but are fitted for hot, as well as damp or dry countries, and for the Arctic regions. He might appeal to the fact that no species in the group next to manânamely, the Quadrumana, can resist low temperature, or any considerable change of climate; and that the species which come nearest to man have never been reared to maturity, even under the temperate climate of Europe. He would be deeply impressed with the fact, first noticed by Agassiz (7. âDiversity of Origin of the Human Races,â in the âChristian Examiner,â July 1850.), that the different races of man are distributed over the world in the same zoological provinces, as those inhabited by undoubtedly distinct species and genera of mammals. This is manifestly the case with the Australian, Mongolian, and Negro races of man; in a less well-marked manner with the Hottentots; but plainly with the Papuans and Malays, who are separated, as Mr. Wallace has shewn, by nearly the same line which divides the great Malayan and Australian zoological provinces. The Aborigines of America range throughout the Continent; and this at first appears opposed to the above rule, for most ofthe productions of the Southern and Northern halves differ widely: yet some few living forms,as the opossum, range from the one into the other, as did formerly some of the gigantic Edentata. The Esquimaux, like other Arctic animals, extend round the whole polar regions. It should be observed that the amount of difference between the mammals of the several zoological provinces does not correspond with the degree of separation between the latter; so that it can hardly be considered as an anomaly that the Negro differs more, and the American much less from the other races of man, than do the mammals of the African and American continents from the mammals of the other provinces. Man, it may be added, does not appear to have aboriginally inhabited any oceanic island; and in this respect, he resembles the other members of his class.
     In determining whether the supposed varieties of the same kind of domestic animal should be ranked as such, or as specifically distinct, that is,whether any of them are descended from distinct wild species, every naturalist would lay much stress on the fact of their external parasites being specifically distinct. All the more stress would be laid on this fact, as it would be an exceptional one; for I am informed by Mr. Denny that the most different kinds of dogs, fowls, and pigeons, in England, are infested by the same species of Pediculi or lice. Now Mr. A. Murray has carefully examined the Pediculi collected indifferent countries from the different races of man (8. âTransactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,â vol. xxii, 1861, p. 567.); and he finds that they differ, not only in colour, but in the structure of their claws and limbs. In every case in which many specimens were obtained the differences were constant. The surgeon of a whaling ship in the Pacific assured me that when the Pediculi, with which some Sandwich Islanders on board swarmed, strayed on to the bodies of the English sailors, they died in the course of three or four days. These Pediculi were darker coloured, and appeared different from those proper to the natives of Chiloe in South America,of which he gave me specimens. These, again, appeared larger and much softer than European lice. Mr. Murray procured four kinds from Africa, namely, from the Negroes of the Eastern and Western coasts, from the Hottentots and Kaffirs; two kinds from the natives of Australia; two from North and two from South America. In these latter cases it may be presumed that the Pediculi came from natives inhabiting different districts. With insects slight structural differences, if constant, are generally esteemed of specific value: and the fact of the races of man being infested by parasites, which appear to be specifically distinct, might fairly be urged as an argument that the races themselves ought to be classed as distinct species.

Some of us closer than others.
That all humans are one species is not a fact about biology, but a fact about terminology. Darwin observed that differences between races were easily large enough to categorize them as species differences, rather than race differences, but did not want to wind up drawing an arbitrary line through the Sahara.
The difference between spotted owls and barred owls is less than the difference between whites and east asians, but they get a species designation, in part because bird watchers are splitters.
I, and Darwin, have studied human evolution extensively and deeply.
Charles Darwin optimistically predicted:
civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace throughout the world the savage races. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Schaaffhausen has remarked, will no doubt be exterminated. The break will then be rendered wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilised state as we may hope, than the Caucasian and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as at present between the negro or Australian and the gorilla.â
Thomas Dixon correctly pointed out.
- rich beyond the dream of poetâs fancy, crunching acres of diamonds beneath his bare black feet. Yet he never picked one up from the dust until a white man showed to him its glittering light. His land swarmed with powerful and docile animals, yet he never dreamed a harness, cart, or sled. A hunter by necessity, he never made an axe, spear, or arrowhead worth preserving beyond the moment of its use. He lived as an ox, content to graze for an hour. In a land of stone and timber he never sawed a foot of lumber, carved a block, or built a house save of broken sticks and mud. With league on league of ocean strand and miles of inland seas, for four thousand years he watched their surface ripple under the wind, heard the thunder of the surf on his beach, the howl of the storm over his head, gazed on the dim blue horizon calling him to worlds that lie beyond, and yet he never dreamed a sail.â
People point out the great Zimbabwe as a supposed counter example to Thomas Dixon, but gene testing shows that local legends that the place was built by Hebrew gold miners are true.  Similarly the ancient cities of Ethiopia - built by Kings of the line of King Solomon, with the assistance of regular imports of fresh Jewish architects.
There are some hot Tutsis.   Mrs Helsinki, however, is not one of them.
If you look at Mrs Helsinki, and look at a hot Tutsi, it is obvious which one is further from the ape, and closer to modern type human. Which is why our government has been sponsoring the genocide of Tutsis in the Congo.  Like owls intermediate between the spotted and barred, Tutsis are an embarrassment, and progs need to exterminate embarrassments.

Because WTC 7 was falling sideways before it fell downwards, it did not fall on its own footprint.
The building was falling apart, piece by piece, in an irregular and uneven fashion, until it finally collapsed downwards all at once
First the fuel tank fell down demolishing much of the building's interior.
Then a while after that, quite a while after that, the roof buckles. With the roof losing rigidity, there is nothing to stop the building from leaning to one side.  It proceeds to lean to one side, very slowly at first, then faster and faster, like a tree falling over, then collapses downwards all at once, no longer like a tree but like a building.
Yes, the final fall, collapsing downwards all at once is just like a controlled demolition - but the half hour leading up to that was things falling apart in a way totally unlike controlled demolition, and the few seconds leading up to collapsing downwards all at once was the building falling to one side, the complete opposite of a symmetric collapse.

That is just the first video I clicked on.  I recall several other videos in which the uneven, disorderly, irregular and asymmetric nature of the collapse was even more obvious.

After the horrifying bloodbaths of the twentieth century, the doctrines of equality and demotism should be thoroughly and utterly discredited, should be seen as outrageous, shocking, and evil.
Yet strangely, they are not.
I notice that the Democrats are working their way towards rationalizing nuclear war with Russia, since a hundred million human sacrifices to equality and social justice during the twentieth century were not enough.  They have a lot of overly clever and excessively complicated rationales, but the real reason is this:
Razer sells out to the left because the arc of history supposedly is But Russia, instead of turning prog after communism, shows strong signs of turning to the faith that used to be known as Christianity before progs reinvented Christianity as yet another form of proggism.   Maybe the arc of history is not ever leftwards.  Maybe left wing movements go ever leftwards till they end catastrophically.  Maybe the arc of history peaked at Pol Pot.
Razer hears a voice in his head telling him he has sold his soul and has been speaking power to truth.
Razer wants Russia nuked to make the arc of history go the way it is supposed to so that terrible voice in his head will stop saying terrible things about him.  Nuking Russia is motivated by the same motives as "Never Trump" - that if leftist victory is not inevitable, then it is all a lie, and leftists lose status.
The US sponsored coup to seize the Ukraine is a symptom, not a cause. The actual cause is that Russians treat Pussy Riot as beggars, gypsies, whores, tramps, and thieves, as low status.
The US believes that when Pussy Riot barges into a Cathedral and vandalizes it, the Christians should stop being offensive to Pussy Riot, rather than that Pussy Riot should stop being offensive to Christians, because Pussy Riot is high status and Christians are low status - and if Pussy Riot is low status, then people who post equalist piety to this list are low status, and therefore razer is low status, therefore, they think, Russia needs to be nuked, in order that razer and other people who post off topic equalist crap to this list can be high status.

Financial incentive to have a family rather than be a single parent has been tried.  Turns out that childbearing is profoundly unresponsive to merely financial incentives.
The early Victorians proceeded to emancipate women, figuring that since women were naturally virtuous and responsible, no disaster would ensue. The result, of course, was far too many women giving birth in dark alleys in the rain, eventually leading to our marginally less disastrous welfare state.   I don't have any statistics as to how many, but it was unacceptably many.
(And no, it is not the pill that made the difference.  We have had the condom since the late bronze age, and the sponge since the time of Caesar. In practice, the supposed beneficial effects of new and improved contraception, or campaigns to spread knowledge and use of contraception, only appear at the same time as the actual beneficial effects of welfare for single mothers.  The pill was effectively illegal in Japan until quite recently.  It made only a marginal difference.)
Regency period Australia had another solution to single women who were not being supervised by fathers or husbands, which solution horrifies moderns, and indeed horrified Victorians, but it undeniably worked. That solution being that you just do not allow fertile age women to follow their pussies wherever their pussies might lead. You don't allow women to sleep with men who cannot or will not marry them if pregnant, you don't allow a married woman to sleep with any man other than her husband, and you don't allow women to be disrespectful to their husbands.  You keep women under as much control as necessary to prevent sexual misbehavior.  Which turns out to be quite a lot of control.

VAWA:  Violence Against Women Act.
effect is that in any dispute, police are required to assume the man is in the wrong and the woman in the right.
Title IX:  is a portion of the United States Education Amendments of 1972, prohibiting discrimination against women.   The major absurd effect is that women are supposed to be just as athletic as men, and if they are not, male physical activity must be punished and discouraged. Also effectively discourages teaching geometry or any area of academics were women perform egregiously worse than men, but by far the biggest and most absurd effect is on sports, because that is the area where female underperformance is most egregious.
But academic areas where women perform better than men, or it can be pretended that they do, are just fine.  Title IX prohibits discrimination against women, but not against men.  Any unequal outcomes to women's disfavor must be the result of evil hateful misogyny, but any unequal outcomes to women's favor must be the result of the fact that women are wonderful.
The practical consequence of Title IX is that despite the fact that women perform lower than men on IQ tests, and have considerably less motive than men to get an education, women are massively over represented in education.  (Which under Title IX does not count as discrimination, though any under representation of women in in any specific area, such as sports, does count as discrimination.)

Even less can progs endure the disastrous consequences of applying the same laws to men and women, and they have one hundred and one hypocritical and ingenious ways of ensuring that different sexes are subject to different laws de jure, for example VAWA and Title IX, and treated very differently de facto under what is nominally the same law.
Not only is the marital contract enforced, de jure, on men but not on women, but ordinary contracts are enforced de facto on men but not on women.
Women are allowed to make their own decisions, but when those decisions go bad, as they frequently do because women are childish, illogical, irrational and emotional, white men wind up paying for the costs of decisions made by women of all races.
Libertarians and Men's Rights Activists argue that we should deal with this by demanding that women bear the costs of their own decisions, but when women were emancipated in the Victorian era, we tried that, and the result was far too many women giving birth in dark alleys in the rain, so we wound up with the disastrous system we have now, where women of all races get to make their own decisions, and white men get to pay for those decisions.
In truth, demanding that women be free to make contracts and also be held to contracts is as harsh, ridiculous, and unreasonable as demanding that children be free to make contracts and also be held to contracts, and everyone intuitively realizes this when it comes to actual practical cases, even though they claim to disagree with it in theory and in the Fertile age women therefore should always be under the tutelage of fathers or husbands.  Fertile age women who find themselves without a father or a husband should be detained in government homes for wayward girls under government supervision until they can find a husband willing to take care of them, similar to the Female Factory in late eighteenth century Australia and early nineteenth century Australia. Women in public should be under the supervision of husband or male kin, in the sense that if they behave badly it should be easy to find the responsible male and ask him to take care of the problem, just as we deal with children that misbehave in public places.

In practice, the consequences of applying the same laws in the same way to people of different races are so disastrous that even progs have one hundred and one hypocritical and ingenious ways of ensuring that different races are subject to different laws, de facto and de jure.
For example, obviously alcohol should be legal for whites, and illegal for feather Indians (native north Americans) and progs have one hundred and one legal rationales for making this happen, for example alcohol is commonly illegal in and near Indian reservations.
Drug laws are enforced very differently for blacks and whites, because drugs have disastrous effects on black communities, but not white communities.  Whites on marijuana do not cause problems for other people, as near to none of them as make no difference.  All blacks on marijuana cause big problems for other people, as near to all of them as makes no difference.
The closer someone's race is to apes, the worse the effect of alcohol and drugs.  This difference between races is much larger than the difference between individuals of the same race.
The difference is quite evident even with the highly evolved East Asians.  Venture capitalists usually suspect that engineers are trying to scam them (and usually engineers are trying to scam them) so they like to get drunk with the people they are considering funding, for in wine their is truth.  But even a small amount of alcohol is apt to make an East Asian badly behaved and physically ill.  So the highly evolved East Asians are reluctant to drink enough that you can rely on them to speak truth, so business deals involving East Asians tend to rely more on shared blackmail material, and less on getting drunk together.
A white engineer will cheerfully drink a lot more than an East Asian engineer, but unlike the East Asian engineer, will remain well behaved and fit as a fiddle, even though his ability and inclination to lie It is hard to get East Asian engineers drunk enough to get the truth out of them, and if you do get them drunk enough to get the truth out of them, they are likely to chuck up.
With less evolved races however, the worse alcohol affects them, the more they are inclined to drink it, lacking the self control of East Asians.
Thus in practice, even in very prog San Francisco, drug laws are enforced one way on whites, and in a very different, much harsher, way on blacks, and that is the way the black community likes it.

I earlier pointed out how having blacks under the same laws and legal system as whites has been a disaster for blacks and a disaster for whites, resulting in a situation where for a white person to form a family, he has to spend a fortune on staying away from blacks.  Blacks cannot thrive under a legal system designed for whites. They need harsher and simpler laws like those of Burundi, and blacks cannot learn much in school without being whipped, as the chaos of black schools demonstrates.  To thrive, blacks need simpler and harsher laws, more brutally enforced, that whites.
But there is a another big difference between blacks and whites: Family Just about every white man, as near all of them as makes no difference, makes a huge effort to be a father to his children, in the face of a legal system that attempts to impose black style families on whites.
Almost no black men, as near none of them as makes no difference, make much effort to be a father to their children.
It was wrong of us to attempt to impose white style families on black people back in the 1950s, and it is wrong of us to impose black style families on white people today.
We should have one set of laws, African style marriage, for blacks reproducing, and a different set of laws, traditional European style marriage, for whites reproducing.

By your deeds, you admit the reality that the differences between races on many important matters are greater than the usual differences between one member of that race and another member of that race - that in many important matters the differences in behavior between one race and another are greater than a standard deviation.
I bet you, or more likely your parents, spend a great deal of money to live in a place where there are no blacks.
In America, nearly every white who can afford to, lives in a place where you cannot go anywhere without a car, because fewer blacks go to places where you need cars to go to, and where all the public spaces are in fact private, like shopping malls, so that private security can deal with blacks who act up.
In America, there are some hip white people who live in vibrant zones, but they are mostly young and male, thus better able to defend themselves, and mostly single, and thus disproportionately gay, because they would not like to expose wives and children to such danger.
Under Obama, gentrification has been reversed by ethnic cleansing.
Recall that YouTube video about a woman walking around in New York city and being harassed by males - "10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman"
It would have been more accurately captioned "10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a White"  There were a bunch of reply videos that showed that a woman could walk for ten hours in white areas and have no problems.
In areas where there are vibrants, no white person uses the buses, because a white taking a bus will be beaten up.
Remember all that stuff about sending black people to the back of the bus.  You wanted integrated buses, but instead got buses with no whites.
If you look at black countries where blacks are doing OK, they have simple laws harshly enforced, for example Botswana.  For blacks to thrive, they need to live under laws substantially different from those that enable whites to thrive.
This is pretty obvious in schools, where a disciplinary process that is fine for whites results in total chaos and major brutal violence in black schools.  For blacks to get an education, they need to be whipped from time to time.  Any black parent with an intact well functioning family will tell you that.  And that is pretty much what the Botswanan police will tell you.

Pretty much everyone who thought Zimmerman guilty, and pretty much everyone who prematurely condemned the Duke Lacrosse team on the testimony of a lying drunken thieving violent black whore who was trying to talk her way out of a yet another charge of violent drunken assault in a long history of violent drunken assaults and stupid violent thefts, believes that blacks have right to chimp out on whites because all whites are guilty of racism, believe that whites make Africa and Detroit poor, and that if only whites were eliminated other races would have all the stuff that whites have.
That was implicit in the arguments we heard for the guilt of Zimmerman, and implicit in the arguments we heard for the premature conviction of the Duke Lacrosse team.
Pretty much everyone who has been educated in Harvard believes that if only whites were eliminated other races would have all the stuff that whites have.
When Obama says "You did not build that", what near fifty percent of the voters hear is that wealth just springs forth from the magic dirt, and due to racism, white people get it all.
When the BLM burns down a supermarket that whites built and beats up the whites that built it, and that supermarket is not promptly replaced by a supermarket run by black women that gives out stuff for free, they think that the reason they were not given a supermarket the way white males supposedly were given ("You did not build that") is racism.
They are outraged and indignant that they do not get a new supermarket the way that Obama told them whites got a new supermarket.
That is the worldview taught in Harvard, and its logical implication is that all whites should be murdered.
Harvard, and Obama, preach slogans that like "liquidation of the kulaks as a class" preserve a careful ambiguity between erasing white culture and civilization, and erasing whites physically. Harvard engages in symbolic acts erasing white civilization, but when these symbolic acts get down to their vote bank, the mass of the voters hear Harvard instigating the physical erasure of whites, that the physical erasure of whites is desirable and morally right.

Everyone who claimed Zimmerman was guilty claimed to believe that Zimmerman attacked Martin - but, as evidence for their position, presented not evidence that Zimmerman attacked Martin, but evidence that Zimmerman behaved provocatively by profiling Martin, thus justifying Martin chimping out on Zimmerman.
They claimed to believe that Zimmerman attacked Martin, but as evidence for this supposed belief presented grounds for Martin to attack Zimmerman.

At present three hundred million people communicate by Viber.
When you install Viber, it generates a secret key and a public key and sends the public key to Viber headquarters.
When Ann wants to message Bob, Viber headquarters sends Ann's client Bob's public key, and Bob's client Ann's public key.
And then they can message each other, no one on the network, not even Viber headquarters, can know what they are saying to each other.
Unfortunately Viber could send Ann a public key belonging to the CIA as Bob's key and Bob another key belonging to the CIA as Ann's key, and then the CIA can be in the middle as Ann and Bob send messages to each other.  Ann thinks she is sending a message to Bob, but actually she is sending it to the CIA, which then resends it to Bob.
To prevent this, to deny itself this capability, Viber could maintain a rolling global hash representing the current mapping between ids and public keys, and all past mappings between ids and public keys, and when it sends Ann the key for Bob, sends Ann the hash path connecting Bob's mapping to the current rolling hash for the entire world and all of history.
We have several mutually hostile people and organizations monitoring this rolling hash, for example the KGB, the CIA, Wikileaks, and Trump's security guy (who I think is one of his sons or grandsons). Your software picks an organization at random.  The user could intervene and pick one, or pick several, but ordinarily will not.
Suppose Viber headquarters arranges for the CIA to spy on Ann and Bob. If Ann and Bob's Viber clients have both picked the CIA for their source for the rolling hash, then they are out of luck, but if one of them has picked the KGB and the other has picked the CIA, then the one that picks the KGB will get the correct version of the rolling hash, in which case the attempted man in the middle attack will fail, and that Viber headquarters is collaborating with the CIA will be exposed to the KGB, to Ann, and to Bob.
Thus Viber could prove it is not spying on its users.

Further a small learning curve is not needed.  We can in fact have zero clicks security - placing the burden on designers and developers, not users.
For example phishing could easily be abolished by making all passwords zero knowledge password protocol under the hood and placing logins in the chrome.
Well, not easily because we would have to rewrite existing standards and redo much existing software, but easily for the end user, who would scarcely notice that anything had changed.
Similarly, it is possible to ensure that the mapping between public keys and IDs looks the same for everyone in the world, preventing MIM attacks without burdening the user to manage his public keys himself.

There is absolutely no doubt whatever that whoever the man being attacked was, and whoever fired the gun, the man who got shot was committing a felony, was shot to prevent him from continuing to commit that felony, and is a leftist political enforcer whose job it is to enforce leftism the way it is always enforced: by violence.

Here is a collection of the latest on the incident.
tl;dr  Leftists beat up a shitload of people.  Guy who got shot had brass knuckles and a big knife.  Employed the brass knuckles to beat up lots of people.  Got shot as a result.
Look at the video:
A short middle aged Asian man in a yellow hat is minding his own business when an a big antifa races out of the crowd, attacks him and beats him up, one of the many, many, many attacks on real, suspected, alleged, or imaginary rightists that have been happening since Trump was elected.  He chases the short guy in the yellow hat all over the place, a bunch of other antifa joined in or are about to join in, then the short Asian guy in the yellow hat shoots the antifa, or possibly a trump supporter in a red hat shoots the antifa to protect the short Asian guy in the yellow hat.
The guy who got shot is not a union organizer, but a union enforcer.  He is an antifa, one of the people in the left who maintain the ideological uniformity of the left by beating up and frequently murdering fellow leftists who deviate from the latest line.
It is not yet clear who did the shooting, and whose side the Asian guy was on, but it is clear who was shot, and whose side he was on. Regardless of who did the shooting, the shooting was defense against a left wing ideological enforcer who was doing a bit of enforcement.
The second amendment is the ultimate defense of the first.
There have been thousands of vicious attacks on real and suspected Trump supporters, and very little of it is getting coverage.

However in our degenerate era, women who perform their proper roles in war and battle are forced to dress as men, and get men's job descriptions, when they should be classed as camp followers, and given more flattering costumes.

     of scaleâ. The Pyatigorsk Cheka organized a âday of Red Terrorâ to
     execute 300 people in one day, and took quotas from each part of
     town. According to the Chekist Karl Lander, the Cheka in
     Kislovodsk, âfor lack of a better idea,â killed all the patients
     in the hospital.
     In October 1920 alone more than 6,000 people were executed.
     Gellately adds that Communist leaders âsought to justify their
     ethnic-based massacres by incorporating them into the rubric of
     the âclass struggle'â.
     Members of the clergy were subjected to particularly brutal abuse.
     According to documents cited by the late Alexander Yakovlev, then
     head of the Presidential Committee for the Rehabilitation of
     Victims of Political Repression, priests, monks and nuns were
     crucified, thrown into cauldrons of boiling tar, scalped,
     strangled, given Communion with melted lead and drowned in holes
     in the ice. An estimated 3,000 were put to death in 1918 alone.
  And, of course, there is the Haitian revolt.
All whites in Haiti were murdered, presaging what is likely when
America becomes nonwhite majority.
All commies should be killed, preferably dropping them into the
Pacific ocean from helicopters.  After that, we prohibit Jews,
nonwhites, women, people who do not own land, and people who are not
legally entitled to bear arms from voting or holding any government or
quasi government office which involves exercising authority over adult
white males.

James A. Donald asked a stupid question:
This would be a more convincing answer if:
1.  I had ever seen progs attack without many to one odds in their favor, or without hitting and running.
2.  If all Putin supporters and Trump supporters were not deemed nazis and fascists.
3.  If the world was not full of conspicuously subhuman people artificially designated by the state as human, which people are allowed to cause problems for the real humans.
4.  If whenever subhumans harass humans, as for example Pussy Riot desecrating a Cathedral, leftists did not react as that adding to leftist status and reducing the status of regular humans.
My point being that you depict leftists as strong and powerful, and everyone else as weak and vulnerable, but leftists in action do not in actual practice act as if they feel themselves to be strong individually.   Rather they adopt the female strategy of whining and weeping a lot and claiming to be victimized.
During the Occupy protests, an Occupy mob descended upon a Koch event. One of the Koch brothers came out with three rentacops, (I don't recall exactly how many, but it was three or so) facing perhaps something like a hundred protesters, and forced them back. Protesters called for police to intervene in favor of the protesters against the Koch brother and his horribly brutal rentacops.
Leftists identify with subhumans, supposedly because they care so deeply about far away people they have never met, but they identify primarily when subhumans do bad things to regular humans.

Big words:

Progs do not have a chance.
Recall the altercation outside Milo's talk when the bald man with brass knuckles and a knife and the assistance of his numerous buddies attacked the short middle aged guy in a yellow hat.
The attack went on for twelve seconds before yellow hat chose to use his gun.  Facing two new adversaries in front of him, and glancing at the bald man behind him out of the corner of his eye, he pulled his gun and cleared a line of retreat with one shot.
Despite being attacked by multiple assailants for twelve seconds, one of them employing brass knuckles, he suffered no injuries that would have impaired his ability to fight or shoot, or even provoke him to draw his gun.  He only drew his gun when the bald man got additional reinforcements cutting off his line of escape.
And this is absolutely typical of every conflict I have seen.  Progs either hit and run, or they attack a dozen on one.  They are absolutely terrified of an equal fight, and with good reason to be terrified.

And what happens if men do not come to be a nation, or just cease to
be nation, perhaps because of loss of tribal or religious identity?

of Detroit and the inner city.  White Swedish chicks get pregnant by

A people with high asabiyyah, like the pagan Icelanders, can get by
without a central government, provided that they are proud, brave, and
valiant warriors, but when Christianity arrived, things fell apart.
Something like anarcho capitalism worked for the pagan Icelanders,

For no apparent reason, he confronted the cop, and then assaulted the cop, who after a remarkable display of wild and incompetent shooting, finally managed to kill his assailant.

All of your Black Lives Matter stories involve blacks behaving badly in ways that made it reasonable for cops - or indeed anyone - to shoot them.
Blacks are used to their violence being indulged and overlooked, especially when they engage in violence against whites, and sooner or later they get violent with a man with a gun.  Bad idea.  Every Black lives matter incident is a rerun of George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin.
Michael Brown is a typical example.  Walking down the middle of the road after robbing a convenience store, confronts a cop for no sane reason, just for the hell of it. Unsurprisingly gets shot while attacking the cop.  And then there was that boy with the highly realistic pellet gun, who is probably whom you are thinking of when you say "shot on camera". Bad idea to shoot cops for the hell of it even with a pellet gun.
I did say in the United States and after the Trump election.  You have to sweep all of history and the entire world to find white hate crimes, whereas black hate crimes against whites happen every day in every black majority neighborhood, and no one pays attention.
Similarly, if you look at cases where a white murders a black (not a white cop, an ordinary white drug dealer or gangster) the black is almost always committing a felony at the time he was shot.  There is about one killing per year of non feloneous blacks by whites, while there are roughly three hundred killings per year of non feloneous whites by blacks.
Black people in the United States are more likely to be victims of violent confrontations with police officers than whites because they commit more violent crimes than whites.  In 2013, black criminals carried out 38% of murders, compared to 31.1% for whites, but despite that more than twice as many white people were killed by police, indicating that a white criminal is at far higher risk of being killed in a confrontation with police than a black criminal - presumably because cops know that any time they defend themselves against vicious subhuman thugs, they will get the Black Lives Matter treatment.

If you guys had some real hate crimes committed by non Jewish white males, you would not be reduced to making so much shit up.  There has been a flood of supposed white male hate crimes against women, blacks, and Jews since the election of Trump, and every one committed in the United States has been a hoax.
But I see huge numbers of entirely real hate crimes committed by non whites and feminists.
The Jewish problem is rather like the Muslim problem.  Not all Muslims are terrorists, but the vast majority of terrorists are Muslims, and similarly not all Jews instigate hate crimes, but if you hear anyone teaching dim witted people to commit hate crimes against whites, he is usually a sharp witted Jew.
Notice that most of the outrage about Trump turning Muslim asylum seekers away comes from people who conspicuously fail to be outraged by Israel turning Muslim asylum seekers away.
Of course they are not all hypocrites:  Soros wants Israel destroyed and Israelis murdered as much as he wants America destroyed and white Americans murdered.  On the whole I prefer the hypocrites.
Trumps ingenious tactic of giving the Jews recognition of Jerusalem but taking away the holocaust tends to split the Jewish hypocrites, so that some of them stop calling for the destruction of America, thus becoming consistent, and some of them start calling for the destruction of Israel, thus becoming consistent.

I see blacks chimping out.  I don't see nazis burning synagogues. I see Muslims burning synagogues, however.
An observer who watches the video closely will note a subtle absence of furtiveness in the assailants. There is an almost perceptible insouciance in live streaming a kidnapping under your own account name while revealing your own smiling faces. These are the kind of clues law enforcement personnel are trained to detect.
Thereâs a reason for such blithe unconcern. The obvious one is the culprits plainly did not see themselves as doing anything wrong which would necessitate concealment of their identities. Thatâs probably correct, but not the most correct.
The four age irrelevant teens werenât at all wrestling with moral dilemmas they could barely process even where choices are stark. Rather, they were responding to a perceived set of rewards and punishmentâstimulus and reinforcement.
The kidnappers chose to commit and openly advertise their crime because they believed doing so would produce a net emotional reward. By their own alleged account, they wanted the video to go viral. Whether considering incarceration or not, they plainly anticipated positive acclaim from publicly injuring and debasing a white man. This is a learned behavior.
American Teens have been indoctrinated to believe that whites donât exist as beings of moral value, but rather totems of their own squalid inadequacies. Black woes always have a white face. And so what exactly is wrong with carving a small piece of that face off for posterity?
This idea is reinforced by all respectable information channels with increasing directness. Those channels that dissent are exhaustively examined for links to a defunct German political party. Regardless, when such seeds are planted in shallow intellectual soil where very few ethical qualms grow, yesterdayâs event becomes surprising only in its poor quality of camerawork.
But itâs not just that these perpetrators are dumb, it is that their dumbness is intentionally exploited. Even the dullest whites quickly digest that if they so much as subject a black to faint praise an avalanche of condemnation and legal recriminations await. That doesnât mean whites never attack blacks, it means such actions are inhibited by extreme disincentives. In contrast, blacks learn that attacking whites typically earns acclaim on Worldstar, a winking shrug from the media, possibly a hagiographic Hollywood film, and if nothing else tenure at the University of Wisconsin.
This week in Chicagoland, four Feral-Americans â two males and two females â kidnapped and tortured, live on film uploaded to Facebook, a mentally disabled White 18 year old man, cackling gleefully as they had him drink toilet water, nearly scalped him, and made him recite âFuck Trumpâ and âFuck White peopleâ. The kidnapping and torture dragged on for nearly two days. One of the HBzeroes, Brittany Herring, narrated the torture-fest. Itâs as chimptastic as youâd surmise.
YouTube scrubbed the video.
NPR refused to identify the races involved.
CNN ignored it (until late today), and finally confronted the story with a bunch of shitlib talking heads fretting over ten heavily-edited seconds of a thirty minute video.
The Chicago police chief jupmed ahead of the message machine and said it wasnât a hate crime
If the Chicago kidnapping races were reversed, about seven Hollywood films would currently be in pre-production.
The reason white shitlibs excuse or sugarcoat the depraved violence of blacks is because they donât really believe blacks have moral agency. And frankly, theyâre right. ...
White shitlibs are undergoing a heretical threat to their religion like none theyâve experienced before; and you know from history that when a zealot is cornered and disillusioned, and his icons thrown to the ground, he will lash out in rage and demand the heads of the infidels.
the root cause is a generation of anti-white (and anti-Christian, etc.) propaganda put out by the Cathedral. Before a child even starts Kindergarten, they are taught these messages on TV, a soft form of inclusiveness and diversity that is later flipped to "white man the devil" if not before, then when they are in university. This propaganda is increasingly hateful as time goes by because Cthulhu swims left, but also because the population of minorities is growing and creating their own narratives.
Americans are reminded of the evils of lynching in the past, which of course always involved sweet innocent black victims. No, no they did not. Just look at the news records of two I wrote about here and posted the newspaper account. Many were of men guilty of crimes. Those were not for fun.
Now look at the Chiraq 4 and what they did. Detained a special needs white guy for being white, tortured, beat and mocked him. This is like a lynching. All of those "geez, wrong place wrong time" murders that people shake their heads at are modern day lynchings. Media would never call them that but what is it when someone simply takes a wrong turn and they get robbed, raped and murdered for being in the wrong neighborhood? Hollywood will have a white guy say, "Don't come 'round here boy" to some black teen in a spiffy outfit. Blacks will flip out when a white even puts the term 'boy' in a tweet in any way related to a black, yet this attack is not racial. Would Hollywood ever recreate the Knoxville horror? Of course not.

A few weeks after her moral preening and posturing at the Golden Globes, when she portrayed herself and her fellow jet-setting Hollywood millionaires as the most vilified section of American society, Meryl Streepâs new âpoor meâ violin concerto has tugged at the leftâs heartstrings once again â this time at Waldorf Astoria in New York, during her acceptance of the National Ally for Equality Award from the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues.
Itâs terrifying to put the target on your forehead, and it sets you up for all sorts of attacks and armies of brownshirts and bots and worse, and the only way you can do it is to feel you have to. You have to. You donât have an option. You have to.âAs she insistently told the appreciative audience.
Who and where are these brownshirts, you might wonder, as I do too. Has Trump set up some sort of a new paramilitary force of thug-supporters to harass and beat up his political opponents, shut down public events he disagrees with, and set fires and smash things in orgies of senseless violence? So far, all this and more is being done by the self-described anti-Trump âanti-fascistsâ. So quite possibly when Ms Streep complains about brownshirts she really just means people who disagree with her political and cultural viewsâ¦..

I might have more sympathy for Meryl Streep if her Waldorf Astoria appearance was shut down by hundreds of black-clad masked protesters who beat up and pepper sprayed the unfortunate attendees and set fire to the venue.

It is the Will of god that they kill infidels and rape infidel women.
Their family, their society, and their mosque supports them in so doing, whereas if they were to kill fellow Muslims in their home town, their mosque would be mighty pissed about it.
It is the duty of Muslims to wage war on infidels until the enemy is subdued.  When you have only a few Muslims, it is possible to interpret this as crime, but when the proportion of Muslims reaches about thirty percent, it becomes rather obvious that it is war, and must be dealt by military means, rather than police means.
That means you have to use the laws of war - the old laws of war, that allow for collective punishment of hostile enemy populations and similar martial law type solutions.

So if your client looks up its own public key by phone number, it sees a hash chain connecting that association to the global witness hash, and knows that client it is talking to sees the same public key.  Clients upload and download public keys at infrequent intervals without human This works fine with phones, since people assume one phone number per physical phone.  Phone forwarding systems are assumed to forward from one phone number/physical device to another phone number physical device. Not so fine with email addresses. Just have to give people the 'Your emails are currently encrypted so that they can only be read on the following physical devices ...
"Add current device to list for future emails?"
"Edit list of devices that are empowered to decrypt your email?"
Which interface is likely to confuse and irritate them.
And if you lose or damage the physical device that currently holds all your old emails and you have not backed it up recently, thus losing all your old emails and the secret key that can decrypt them - that could be very handy if an investigation is coming up.

I remarked earlier that several security proposals would not in practice be useful because Hillary's main security concern was not the Russians stealing her emails, not Wikileaks stealing her emails, not the Chans stealing her emails, but Obama stealing her emails.
Similarly, it is clear that if Trump had a chat with Assad of Syria clearing a bombing run Isis in Syria, his target list would appear in the New York Times, as he bitterly complained in his latest press Indeed this appears to be what has already happened with the Trump's raid on Al Qaeda in Yemen - the information wound up in the hands of Al Qaeda, probably by the State Department electronically intercepting Trump and Pentagon communications and then leaking the information to their pet "Moderate Islamic Opposition" aka Al Qaeda and Islamic State, and as a result several American commandos were killed or wounded.  They got killed as a result of conflict between the red empire of the bases and the blue empire of the consulates.
It very much looks as if Chief Petty Officer William "Ryan" Owens was killed as a result of people in the US government leaking information to the enemies of Americans.  Trump in his recent news conference reports his phone calls are being listened into by his enemies and then made public, so the leak mechanism in the Yemen case was likely similar.
This is far from being the first deadly conflict between the red and blue empires, though the internal conflict within the US government looks to be escalating massively under Trump.
In general, your biggest spying threat is from people mighty close to you.
I am not worried about the CIA spying on me. I am worried about them spying on Trump.
To solve this problem, we need end to end encryption with the keys on your own device.  And we need everyone using by default and standard, so that Hillary's not very bright people and Trumps menials use it when communicating with Hillary and Trump.  Which means all proposals that require managing their own keys are not going to work.
For Hillary's people to use it, it needs to be so standard that even people arranging assignations on Facebook use it without being aware of it.  That is why proprietary usb dongles will not work.
It is unlikely that Trump would manage his own public keys - and he cannot trust the white house staff and government security people to manage them for him.  It is even more unlikely that Podesta would manage his own public keys.  So we need a security mechanism for the masses, a security mechanism that even the Chairman of the Board can use, a security mechanism suitable for everyone in the world, a security mechanism that requires zero clicks.

She spent a short time alone with Till, during which time she now says nothing happened.  After that short time, Till whistled at her, which caused her husband to believe that something had happened.
Till did not deserve to be killed for whistling at her, but today it often enough happens that people are killed for similar acts.
I was in an elevator with a young lady.  A man said "Hello" to that lady and smiled at her.  I placed my hand on her shoulder and stared at him expressionlessly and silently.  From his reaction I am pretty sure he feared I was going to kill him, even though my expression was totally neutral, blank, and stone faced.
Because people do get killed for that sort of thing today.  Race has nothing to do with it.  That was a murder, not a lynching, and similar murders happen today all the time.
The Tulsa massacre was the murder of ten white men by racist blacks, followed by whites ethnically cleansing the infestation of dangerous blacks from their town.
A black man assaulted a white woman.  He was arrested.
Believing he was likely to be lynched a group of 75 armed blacks went to the courthouse and politely asked that he be secured to receive a fair trial - the white sheriff told them he would receive a fair trial and politely asked them to go home.
These seventy five armed black men confronted a large group of white men in a predominantly white area, some of them armed, who they suspected intended to lynch the black youth who had assaulted a white woman.  The blacks opened fire, killing ten of the white men.
In short, blacks started it, and whites finished it.
If the whites had actually grabbed the youth from the courthouse you would have a point.  But the blacks opened fire on suspicion that the whites might grab the youth from the courthouse, which is much the same thing as blacks lynching whites on vague suspicion, and very different from whites lynching blacks on vague suspicion.
So produce your example of someone wrongfully lynched.

If a Muslim is not murdering infidels, and raping children, he is a bad Muslim.

Traditional muskets are big, clumsy, and kick like a horse, but they blow great big holes in people.  Remember, they rendered armor irrelevant, because they can punch through armor and kill horses with the greatest of ease.
It is the famous AK-47 that is relatively quiet and low power.  Assault weapons are so called because they are designed to be fired while running around, like a handgun.
Assault weapons were named by Hitler (or at least he signed off on the name), "Sturmgewehr", literally "Storm gun, Sturm gewehr" because unlike the considerably heavier guns of World War I, designed to be fired while kneeling in a trench, they were designed to be fired while running towards your enemies, while storming the enemy.
In consequence an assault rifle makes an excellent hunting weapon for a seven year old girl, but adult males generally prefer considerably more powerful guns for hunting, unless they are varmint shooting.
A small child using an assault rifle to hunt usually shoots while kneeling or lying down, and resting the front of the rifle on something, because the weight and recoil makes it difficult for a small child to aim while walking around.

Science largely stopped progressing shortly after World War II.  It has become a priesthood in lab coats.  Peer Review is the priesthood at synod, conspiring behind closed doors to develop a uniform party line. Instead of experimentalists telling us what they see, they are told what they will see.
Technology in West largely stopped progressing after 1972.
Compare, for example "Freedom Tower" with the Two Towers.  Its highest inhabitable floor is substantially smaller and lower than the highest inhabited floor of the two towers, and it just looks ugly, unimpressive, and sadly early twentieth century, a little bit old fashioned.  Our fastest fighter planes have smarter electronics, but they fly slower, do not fly so high, and are less maneuverable.
Technology continues to progress in East Asia, though slowly, for example ever better phone screens, LED lighting, higher energy density batteries, and so on and so forth. Which is odd, since even East Asians agree that East Asians are uncreative and need white leadership to achieve technological advance.  Why are white people, who have always led the world, taking a back seat?

That is because she never had anything whatsoever to do with the portrait of Franklin D Roosevelt on the US dime.
Like most black inventors, scientists, artists, etc, her achievements are largely fictional, fraudulent, or plaigarized.
The portrait on the US dime is by John R. Sinnock, and resembles his previous works on Roosevelt, predating her works, so she copied from him, badly.  He did not copy from her.

Ada Lovelace made no significant contributions for science, mathematics, or computer science.
The work for which Ada is most famous consists of writing up Babbage's algorithm descriptions.  She did not create them herself, but from Babbage's notes.
Babbage hired her to generate publicity for his difference engine because she was famous, and she was famous because she was a *female* scientist and mathematician, as a dancing bear is famous not for dancing well, but for dancing at all.
Grace Hopper cause Cobol to be created, a language infamous for being bad, but popular with authority figures.  She issued a bunch of extremely bad specifications, reflecting what authority figures who do not understand computing are likely to mistakenly think that they want, and then programmers who were actually competent then gave effect to her incompetent and bad idea.
There are no great female scientists.  If there were you would not have been reduced to giving Marie Curie not one but two Nobel prizes for work that no male would have received a Nobel prize for.  (For the similar but far more important discovery of Radon made at about the same time got no Nobel prize), work that she did as the least important member of a team of three scientists, all of them greater than her, and yet the two males did not get the Nobel prize.
There is one great female mathematician, Noether, of whom it was said "I can testify that she is a great mathematician, but that she is female I am far from sure."  All other supposedly great female mathematicians are fakes in the style of Marie Curie, or routine mediocrities in the style of Ada and Hopper.

It is not exactly a hoax.  Rather, they cherry pick the evidence, torture the data, use nonsensical statistical methods, and reject unwanted evidence as error, as for example The Hockey stick curve is not exactly a lie.  Rather, what they did is use an estimate for recent twentieth century warming, and took any data that correlated with that during the twentieth century, declared anything that correlated to be a proxy for temperature, and took the weighted average of all these "proxies"
Since they were, for the most part, not measures of temperature, they tended to cancel out except for the period where they had been selected for correlating, thus producing a hockey stick.
If your data is random noise, and you select those noise sequences that rise from 1970 to 1990, and take their average, you get a hockey stick blade from 1970 to 1990, and everything before 1970 flat, *and* *everything* *after* *1990* flat, because except for the period on which you are selecting, everything cancels out.
Of course, as time passed, they proceeded to once again cancel out, so the hockey stick curve developed a sudden dip - the proxies were reporting that the earths temperature was falling back to its long term average - not because it was falling back, but because these proxies were not in fact proxies, but just random noise.
This was the "decline" that Mann refers to in "Mike's Nature Trick to hide the decline"
Which brings me to the climategate files.  I have read the climategate files.  It reflects not so much a conspiracy to fake up evidence of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming, as total lack of interest in whether the world is warming or not.  They are not looking for evidence of what is actually happening, but rather whatever can be useful in a political campaign.
They say, and it may well be true, that this how science is done these days.  If true, science died in the late forties, and what we have now is priests in labcoats.

Anarcho socialists and anarcho communists have provided vague and evasive answers on this question, which answers I interpret as saying the central planning committee will command what is to be produced and ration what is to be consumed, as in Soviet Russia or today's Venezuela and North Korea.  And if you do not produce as directed, or if you attempt to consume more than allotted, off to the gulag you go.
Aside from not being very anarchistic, this does not work very well. The planners strangle themselves in red tape and when you go to collect your bread ration, there is no bread.  Google Venezuela bread.
Anarcho capitalists of course have a simple and obvious solution, and, for a change, will actually tell you their solution:  Which is that the rich capitalist purchases the resources needed to build a car, purchases or builds the tools necessary to build a car, hires people to build cars, and tells them what to do.  In this model all rights are property rights, and if you violate someone's property rights, private security takes care of you.
With the rise of the reactionary right, there is now also an anarcho feudalist movement, which proposes feudalism with a weak king appointed from time to time by a board composed of or representing the aristocracy. Sounds awfully like an electoral republic with a restricted franchise, but the difference is that aristocrats make local laws and administer local justice.
Now I am sure that anarcho socialists can point out all sorts of horrid problems with other variants of anarchism, but when there is no bread, no one is going to worry about those problems.  The failure of socialism tends to be more fundamental and less abstract.

This is the problem of clustering in groups of enormously high dimension, which is a well studied problem in AI.
Take each substring of six words or less, that does not contain a full stop internally.  The substring may contain a start of sentence marker at the beginning, and or an end of sentence marker at the end.
Each substring constitutes a vector in a space of enormously high dimension, the space of all possible strings of moderate length.
Each such vector is randomly but deterministically mapped to a mere hundred or so dimensions, to a space of moderately high dimension, by randomly giving each coordinate the value of plus one, minus one, or zero.
Two identical substrings in two separate documents will be mapped to the same vector in the space of moderate dimension.
Each document is then given a position in the space of moderately high dimension by summing all the vectors, and then normalizing the resulting vector to length one.
Thus each document is assigned a position on the hypersphere in the space of moderately high dimension.
If two different documents contain some identical substrings, will tend to be closer together.
We then assign a document to its closest group of documents, and the closest subgroup within that group, and the closest sub sub group.

I have asked this question, how to do a secret handshake that reveals common membership of the group without giving away your membership to non members, several times before, and not been happy with the answers, so I guess I am asking it badly.
I will try to be clearer about the problem I am trying to solve.
These days, people no longer communicate on Usenet and email lists. Rather they use something for which we have not formed a word. I will call it a social blogging platform, unless someone has a better word.
Twitter, Facebook, and to a lesser extent WordPress, and such are all examples of this.
In a blogging platform, you post and people comment on your post. WordPress is the classic example
Plus, it is a communication medium, you can chat privately to people and groups, like viber.
Viber and skype are messenger with very little blogging, WordPress is blogging with very little messenger, Facebook is the two integrated. Viber is currently the best messaging system, WordPress the best blogging, Facebook the best integrated messaging and blogging system, but the world is moving to tighter integration.  Every messaging platform is adding some blog like features, every blogging system is adding some messaging type features.
Facebook consists largely of chicks posting "look at me, I am hot", boys commenting, "yes, you are hot", and then they go into Facebook messenger, communicate privately, and make an assignation to have sex. It was designed from the beginning for the purpose, hence the excellent integration between the posting and commenting, which is analogous to WordPress, and the private messaging, which is analogous to skype. Facebook is pretty much Skype+WordPress, and all the others are competing for the same market niche, though Facebook totally dominates the sexual assignation and booty call niche by far.
Specialist systems, for example the Cupid system for international dating have the same basic architecture - posts plus tightly integrated private messaging.
The trouble is that the major systems, especially twitter, are heavily politicized and censored, and so people are forming alt-tech, such as Gab, to escape from politics and censorship.
If you want to read a science paper about the nut gathering activities of the gray squirrel, or an adventure comic about the Mighty Thor, or a science fiction story about flash Gordon traveling to the far stars, you instead get politics.
You think you are reading about the nut gathering activities of the gray squirrel, and it turns into the effect of global warming on the gray squirrel, which effect we are told is extremely bad, though no concrete evidence of this is provided, the evils of global warming upon the squirrel being asserted but not actually shown.
But it is not actually about the effect of global warming on the gray squirrel, rather it is about global warming itself. We are told that global warming is even worse than we thought, though how bad we used to think it was is never precisely specified, and how bad now we think it is not specified either, and the evidence that we should now think it even worse is alluded to rather than given.
But it is not actually about global warming itself, rather it is that the industrial civilization that white people created is destroying the But it is not actually about the destruction of the earth by white civilization, rather it is that heterosexual white males are horribly bad, and extremely harmful to all other kinds of creatures.
Similarly, when one read the adventures of Thor, one encounters female Thor.  But it is not actually about female Thor, it is that gender binary is false and evil.  But it is not actually about gender binary, it is that ... heterosexual white males are horribly bad, and extremely harmful to all other kinds of creatures.
And similarly, when Flash Gordon travels to the far stars, it turns out that an evil corporation run by white heterosexual patriarchal males is oppressing blue skinned tree living aliens to steal their natural resources ... bad, and extremely harmful to all other kinds of creatures.
This endless insulting, ignorant, stupid, and offensive hectoring happens all the time, everywhere, on every topic, in every medium, on every platform, from Facebook to Twitter, from Scientific American to Marvel comics, from romance novels to first person shooter games, and if you complain, you are racist, sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic, and a denier and you get banned.  Observe for example that the only people allowed to be good fathers on television or the comics are blacks, and even black males are still required to have broken families.  Evidently the depiction of a good father ruling over a happy family is homophobic, bastardphobic, sexist, racist, whatever.
Recall that the movie "Man in a high castle" used a happy intact family on its poster as a symbol of Nazism. We are so accustomed to being lectured, shouted at, and spat upon that the shouting is felt to be normal and non political, and any easing up of the shouting and the spitting, as for example a science fiction writer who gives us a science fiction story rather than a lecture, is deemed to be extreme right wing politics.  If you hoist an umbrella against the spit, you are a Nazi and you are planning to murder the Jews.  And you probably really are a Nazi and probably really are planning to murder the Jews, because only really hard cases like actual Nazis planning to murder actual Jews are willing to defy public opinion by hoisting an umbrella against being spat upon.
To deal with this problem, people are developing alt tech, for example gab.ai, which is Twitter without mandatory left wing propaganda all the time on every topic.  Similarly 8chan is a reaction to the endless tedious left wing agitation and fierce censorship of 4chan
The most interesting conversations are happening on secretive invitation only sites, because it is only safe to say true things on a secretive invitation only site.
So, what I am thinking of is a way to integrate secretive invitation only sites in a messaging network of public sites.
It would be nice if when you clicked on a commenters id, you got a link to his posts, and to his comments on other people's posts - but if some of these posts and comments were on invitation only sites, you would only see those comments and posts if you were able to browse those sites, if you could have seen those comments and posts without necessarily following the link, and, more importantly, only be able to detect the existence of such comments and posts if you were able to browse those sites.  Even if you were using special software, not the regular client but a hostile client, you should not be able to detect that the commenter posts to secretive websites, or that such websites exist.

The courts are corrupt.  We need Duterte's solution to judicial corruption and lawlessness.
The courts are no substitute for a disciplined police force - it is easier for judges to get away with wicked, abusive, and corrupt behavior than it is for police.  As for example patent law and the silicone lawsuits.
The various protections for criminals are part of an endless effort to get black conviction and imprisonment rates down to white levels, thus in practice these protections apply to black criminals, not to law abiding cishet whites.  Consider, for example the conviction of Martha Stewart, supposedly for insider trading - but what she was actually convicted of was obstruction of justice, which she obstructed by not confessing to things that they they could not prove her guilty of.
She sold a bunch of shares just before bad news hit, which is illegal if you know the bad news because of your insider position, and have neglected to make it public before you sell the adversely affected shares.
But they could not prove that she knew the bad news before she sold the shares, so she was in fact convicted for obstructing injustice, convicted her for not confessing to a crime that they plausibly suspected, but were never able to prove.
Compare the Martha Stewart case to a recent supreme court case, where some blacks in a car doing a drug deal drove in a reckless and dangerous manner, because they were distracted by the drug deal.  The supremes ruled that though police could ordinarily arrest them for dangerous driving, and, surprise surprise, find the drugs, it was improper to do that in this case because the dangerous driving arrest might be motivated by the fact that they saw them dealing drugs, and seeing them dealing drugs has been deemed insufficient grounds for search.
Had police not noticed the drug deal going down, then they could have arrested them for dangerous driving and found the drugs.  But because police saw the drug deal going down, the drugs that they found were ruled inadmissable.
If you are doing a characteristically black crime, police are not allowed to see what is right in front of them.  If you are suspected of doing a characteristically white middle class crime, you are subject to the most lawless and arbitrary inquisition.

I am pretty sure that if I give a definition and say "A Merkle tree is such and such", a bikeshed war will ensue over my definition of Merkle tree, which war will probably result in Perry blocking my posts.
So let me define instead a donald tree.   :-)  (just kidding)
A donald tree is a tree where every node contains the hash of its immediate children.  Thus the hash of the root of any subtree guarantees the contents of all its descendants, just as the hash of a file guarantees the contents of the entire file.
This means that we can keep on adding to the tree, while keeping the past immutable, which is a useful feature for tracking who owns what, and who owes what.  If many people see the current hash at time X, you cannot change details about the past of time X without revealing what you have been up to.
Any tree can be severely unbalanced, for example a binary tree where every node has a right hand child, and very few nodes have a left hand child, in which case the depth of the tree is approximately proportional to the total number of nodes in the tree - and the tree grows to enormous depth when the total number of node is enormous.
Or it can be approximately balanced, in which case the depth of the tree is approximately proportional to the log of the number of nodes, which is always a reasonably small number even if the number of nodes is enormous.
And a hash that testifies to every transaction that anyone ever did is going to be the hash of an enormous number of nodes.  But if it is at the root of a tree of moderate depth, then we can validate any part of the tree for conformity with the rules without validating the entire tree for conformity to the rules.

The coin to invest in, the coin that I will invest in both in money and as a software contributor, will solve the scaling problem, will be capable of scaling all the way to wiping out the US$ as a world currency.  It will have integral support for sidechains with payments out of one sidechain to another sidechain being endorsed by sidechain signature from a single authority which is itself periodically but infrequently endorsed by a short sidechain multisignature, which can be generated by arbitrarily complex rules idiosyncratic to that sidechain provided that conformity to the rules has verification of bounded computational time that the central chain can evaluate.  It will have an efficient system for securing history in which Merkle trees do not grow to enormous depth, so that it is possible to efficiently verify any one small part of history without needing to verify all transactions that have ever taken place.   (Because scalability implies we abandon everyone verifying everything down to the last byte.)
It will be decentralized in the sense that if the police grab every single major contributor, software writer, and server, they cannot change the rules and make the currency act differently, they can only seize the money of the people that they have grabbed.

Money, says Moldbug, is a bubble that never bursts, until it does.
A very long time ago, all sorts of strange things, such as dog canine teeth, were money.
It came to pass that only silver and gold were money.
And then only gold.  The demonetization of silver gave us the long depression, which by modern standards was not bad at all - because it was long, gold rose, which is to say prices fell, very slowly, because silver was demonetized very slowly.  People did not like it, hence the "cross of gold speech" demanding that state power be applied to remonetize silver, but all the supposed horrid evils of deflation turned out to be not very evil at all.
 From time to time governments discover that they can make some arbitrary thing money by the mere exercise of power.   This usually ends horribly badly.
Right now we have the disturbing and strange situation that it is hard for savers to receive positive real interest on their money, and at the same time hard for worthy borrowers to borrow money.  The system is malfunctioning rather badly, but monetary systems have frequently malfunctioned one hell of a lot worse, so I will not bother explaining why we are in this hole. (tl; dr; Governments did wicked, but extremely popular, things with money.  To the surprise of many people, myself among them, this did not destroy the currency, but it had other extremely bad effects.)
Because of governments doing bad things with money, the thought occurred to some people: maybe private individuals, not armed with state power, could make some arbitrary thing power.
Turns out, we could.

Seventy thousand years of evolution since Africa.
The white race is only ten thousand years old, the East Asian race not much older.
The original settlers from Africa were very different from us and from today's black Africans.  Seventy thousand years is a long time.
The white race originated from a mingling of brownish brown eyed farmers from what is now the middle east, and blue eyed hunted gatherers of unknown skin color and hair color, probably red haired and yellowish brown skinned, a combination that never occurs in moderns, in Eastern Europe or Siberia, originating from what is now Europe. Neither of these races corresponded all that much to any present day race.
The blue eyed Siberian people were descended from the same race that did the cave paintings in Europe. The hunter gatherers retreated from the farmers, then, in Eastern Europe or Siberia, mingled with them and took up cattle herding with cattle dogs.  The cattle herders then re-entered Europe in repeated waves of genocidal conquest, pretty much eradicating the farmer people that originally farmed Europe.

Democratic party policy is to hike tribalism up to the max, to have integration but resist assimilation.  This is a program bound to end in war, democide, and genocide.

The alliance between La Raza, Black Lives Matter, and the Democrats, resembles the alliance between the Populares and the Samnites.
The Populares and the Optimates were political parties in Roman Empire, "Populare" meaning "People's party"  The Populares corresponded to today's Democrats, the coalition of the fringes, weirdoes versus normal people, minorities versus the majority, the coalition of high and low against middle.
The Populares wanted to give the Samnites (equivalent to today's La Raza) a fairer deal within the Roman Empire.
The Samnites wanted to level the walls of Rome, kill all male Romans, and enslave all Roman women.

You don't say "Kill Jim".  You say you are terribly sad that I have this terrible mental disease that makes it regrettably necessary to kill me.
Which makes you very sad Veganism has been cool for a very long time.  Indeed, the lies on saturated fat were manufactured back in the forties to give "scientific" endorsement to veganism, much as the lies on anthropogenic global warming were manufactured to give "scientific" endorsement to demonizing the technological and industrial civilization that white people created.
Indeed, veganism has recently ceased to be cool, has fallen out of fashion, which made it possible for scientists to notice that saturated fat is actually rather healthy.
The next fashion is going to be buying a young pig, killing it oneself, washing it down with caustic potash to remove the hair, shaving it oneself, gutting it oneself, and throwing a big party around the intact pig, with head and legs all together so it still looks like an animal, roasting on a spit over hot coals.  For organic trendiness, everyone will have lots of ice cold extra fizzy recently fermented high alcohol Kombucha while waiting for the roasting to finish and the pig to be served, plus some beer, coke and mountain dew for those who are not so Further, there are no strict vegans, only vegans that eat vegetables plus milk, cheese, and eggs. The strict vegans are just status posturing.  Strict veganism will make you sick or kill you, and will result in an uncontrollable raging hunger for steak, bacon, fried chicken, and so on and so forth.  Humans are obligate omnivores.  We don't have to eat veggies, though it is difficult to go without.  We do have to eat animals, or at least eat milk, cheese, and eggs in place of animals.  It is impossible to go without, and anyone who says they do without is just plain lying.
And yet you appear to believe, and enthusiastically endorse, tall tales that, if true, would justify killing me, and indeed killing Christians, whites, and males, would make killing me, people like me, and people vaguely resembling me, justifiable self defense.

Little background here.  Before World War II, England, rather than America, was dominant in the anglosphere, and from the restoration of Charles the second to end of World War II, the Royal Society socially enforced the scientific method, awarding status to people who followed it, and denying status to people who failed to follow it.
The King was the fount of all honors, mortal and divine - which means his job was to regulate status competition, so that wins at status were awarded for prosocial, rather than antisocial, activity.
In the early days of the Royal Society, some people objected, objected very strongly, to status being awarded in this fashion, and organized a mob to thump those who received status in this fashion, whereupon Charles the Second sent soldiers to physically back up the Royal Society, thumping those who objected to the status awards as if they were disorderly stray dogs, treating them like beggars, gypsies, whores and thieves, punishing them in ways that reduced their status, rather than martyring them.
Thereby ensuring that he held on to the role that his father lost, as the fount of all honors mortal and divine.
And, while the Royal Society was in charge of defining and enforcing the scientific method, science agreed that saturated fat was good for you, and eating animals was good for you.
When Britain lost World War II and America won it, Harvard got the upper hand over the Royal Society, and introduced "peer review", which means that an anonymous committee of "scientists" decide official truth behind closed doors on the basis of secret evidence, rather than following the scientific method.
Since then, the output of "science" has generally been an indicator of what is high status, rather than what is supported by the evidence, saturated fats being a spectacular example of "scientists" treating evidence, experiment, and data with total contempt.
And thus the output of "science" reveals that veganism was high status until recently, but has recently lost status, because chicks now have high status, chicks like slim men with big muscles, and slim men with big muscles are invariably meat eaters.
As a result "science" is now discovering that eating tasty animals is good for you.

The self destructiveness of today's Jews is a faint echo of the destructiveness and self destructiveness of the rabbis at that time, who got them enslaved and exiled, and their endless legalistic interpretation and re-interpretation and re-re-interpretation of the Jewish law is what got them into trouble in the first place.  If Jews had stuck with the hereditary priesthood ordained by Moses, they would not have gotten into all this trouble, nor caused all the trouble that they have caused for other peoples.
The Rabbis got their people killed, and those that were not killed were enslaved and/or exiled, but the rabbis got what they really wanted. They got power and the hereditary priesthood lost power, at the cost of destroying Jerusalem.
So of course a prophet must have existed complaining about this crap, and of course his life and words would have somewhat resembled the life attributed to Jesus, in that he would criticize the hypocrisy and legalism of the religious establishment, in particular and especially the hypocrisy and legalism of the pharisees, and would have died of it.

We have multiple independent sources suggestive of a holiness spiral in Judaism at the time, consistent with the account given by Josephus and in the gospels.
When the area was ruled by Greeks, the Jewish hereditary priesthood led a revolt against Greek secularism and established a dynasty of priest kings.
The rabbis (pharisees) challenged the power of the hereditary priesthood, on the basis of being holier than thou, and part of being holier than thou was being more willing to get into suicidal war with powerful enemies, just as today's progressives are flirting with nuclear The hereditary priesthood had led the Jews into a war with powerful enemies (Greeks) and won, so the Rabbis wanted to lead the Jews into an even bigger war with even more powerful enemies (Romans plus Greeks under Roman leadership) and win.
Now that the formerly communist regimes have turned right wing, progs are today the war party.  Similarly, rabbis were the war party back in the days of Jesus and Josephus, hence the prophecies of Jesus about the fall of Jerusalem and the temple.
Thus we know from other sources that events must have been much as depicted by Jesus and Josephus.
You suggest that Josephus made up the story of being forced to suicide to justify his betrayal of his comrades, but we have independent evidence that his comrades murdered everyone, Khmer Rouge style, as over the top fanaticism spiraled into even further over the top fanaticism. If they did not attempt to force Josephus to suicide, they forced everyone like him to suicide.

By reading the histories of Josephus, who came mighty close to being forced to suicide by Jewish religious fanatics.
By reading the laws of Augustus, who was simultaneously emancipating women (revealing that his nominal religion was dead in the water) and pressuring men to get married (revealing that men no longer wanted to marry emancipated women).
Over and over again, throughout the last two thousand years, it has been demonstrated that people who adhere to the Pauline laws on marriage reproduce at about seven live grown children per woman if there is adequate food, people who grossly deviate from these rules reproduce at slightly less than two children per woman, even if food is abundant.
Peoples that have bad marriage laws fail to reproduce and disappear from Either we replace our current state religion of progressivism with a religion that supports marriage laws that enable people to safely form families, or we get replaced by conservative Islam.
Either way, female emancipation is going, but the second way it goes because our people, our culture, and our civilization disappears.

A religion is a synthetic tribe.   A state needs a tribe, and tribe needs a state.
Jewish religious tribalism was going nuts at the time, Roman paganism was dissolving in cynicism.
Also, Roman paganism had abandoned patriarchy, and as a result Romans had stopped reproducing.  Christianity retained Jewish patriarchy, so Christians were able to form families and reproduce.
Christianity is around because the state needed a religion, and because Christians had children.   Constantine founded state Christianity, which made a disintegrating state viable, and gave the state a ruling elite that was able to reproduce successfully, a program in due course imitated by Charles the Hammer, who proceeded to defeat Islam and found Today, the ruling state religion is progressivism, but progressives, like Romans when their religion became decadent, cannot reproduce, and like Jews, when their religion became ever more insane in a holiness spiral, are engaged in ever more self destructive and warlike government Thus, self destruction, which requires replacement by a sane and patriarchal state religion.
Conservative Islam is adequately patriarchal, but, absent a Calif, tends to madness.  Maybe we will make Mormonism the state religion, or perhaps import Russia's eastern Orthodoxy.  Our current state religion, progressivism, cannot survive, the only question is whether everyone else perishes with it.

reference in Book 20, Chapter 9, 1 of the Antiquities to "the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James"[12] and considers it as having the highest level of authenticity among the references of Josephus to Christianity.[13][1][2][14][15][16] Almost all modern scholars consider the reference in Book 18, Chapter 5, 2 of the Antiquities to the imprisonment and death of John the Baptist also to be authentic and not a Christian interpolation.[17][18][19] The references found in Antiquities have no parallel texts in the other work by Josephus such as The Jewish War, written 20 years earlier, but some scholars have provided explanations for their absence.[20] A number of variations exist between the statements by Josephus regarding the deaths of James and John the Baptist and the New Testament accounts.[17][21] Scholars generally view these variations as indications that the Josephus passages are not interpolations, for a Christian interpolator would have made them correspond to the New Testament accounts, not differ from them.[17][22][21]

But you would expect someone who was critical of the holiness spiral going on at the time to prophesy the fall of Jerusalem, regardless of whether divinely inspired, God himself, or just another man like myself holding up his finger to see which way the wind blows.
We can be sure that all four primary gospels were written before 70 C.E, because Jesus' prophecies concerning the fall of Jerusalem and the temple were vague, shifty, evasive and unfalsifiable, even though it was obvious at the time that the wind was blowing towards suicidal and self destructive war with the Roman empire
Had they been written up after the fall of Jerusalem, they would have been remembered as much more specific concrete, and detailed.
Shortly before the fall of Jerusalem, Christians did get specific and concrete prophecies about the fall (but by that time it was pretty obvious what was going to come down) and those more concrete prophecies were not misattributed to Jesus.

Further, we have multiple references to the disciples of Jesus. That his movement existed is undeniable.
We know that Jesus the man existed the same way we know that Pontius Pilate existed:
Someone like Jesus the man had to exist, in that the rabbis were engaged in a holiness spiral, a holiness spiral will get called out by prophets, and then those prophets get suppressed, and someone like Pontius Pilate had to exist, in that the Roman Empire ruled the area, and history records Jesus as one of those prophets, and Pontius Pilate as one of the Roman Empire's administrators.

This is stupid.
There is plausible historical evidence that Jesus did not rise from the dead, nor did the sun stand still over one of the Empire's dominions, but we have ample historical evidence for Jesus the man, who was crucified by Pontius Pilate, and anyone who denies it is just stupid or If anything, we have better historical evidence for Jesus the man than Mohammed the Prophet.
In actual practice, the Church was founded by Paul, who used the conveniently dead Jesus as basis for what we now know as Christianity.
Lots of aspects of the founding myth of Christianity are improbable, and either supported only by suspiciously weak evidence, or contradicted by compellingly strong evidence, but that Jesus lived and was crucified by Pontius Pilate is undeniable by anyone half way sane.
The Jewish religion was in a holiness spiral which put them on course for a suicidal confrontation with Rome, therefore one would expect a prophet to condemn this holiness spiral in exactly the manner that Jesus is recorded as condemning it.  And one would expect a prophet who spoke the truth on this matter to get crucified.  As Jesus the man is recorded as being crucified.  This aspect of the founding myth is inherently plausible, and is supported by compellingly strong evidence.

This inherently limits the number of transactions that can be made fully on the blockchain and fully peered to something that is not compatible with taking over the world.
Thus scalability, up to world conquering scales, requires an architecture where most people do not have peer wallets, but client wallets, and most transactions are consolidated into fewer and larger transactions by important peer wallets functioning somewhat like banks before the transactions are entered into the blockchain.

I cannot immediately find your link to your paper.
Obviously, at full scale we are always going to have immensely more clients than full peers, likely by a factor of hundreds of thousands, but we need to have enough peers, which means we need to reward peers for being peers, for providing the service of storing blockchain data, propagating transactions, verifying the blockchain, and making the data readily available, rather than for the current pointless bit crunching and waste of electricity employed by current mining.
The power over the blockchain, and the revenues coming from transaction and storage fees, have to go to this large number of peers, rather than, as at present, mostly to four miners located in China.
Also, at scale, we are going to have to shard, so that a peer is actually a pool of machines, each with a shard of the blockchain, perhaps with all the machines run by one person, perhaps run by a group of people who trust each other, each of whom runs one machine managing one shard of the blockchain.
Rewards, and the decision as to which chain is final, has to go to weight of stake, but also to proof of service - to peers, who store and check the blockchain and make it available.
All durable keys should live in client wallets, because they can be secured off the internet.  So how do we implement weight of stake, since only peers are actually sufficiently well connected to actually participate in governance?
To solve this problem, stakes are held by client wallets.  Stakes that are in the clear get registered with a peer, the registration gets recorded in the blockchain, and the peer is gets influence, and to some extent rewards, proportional to the stake registered with it, conditional on the part it is doing to supply data storage, verification, and bandwidth.

When the diamond trade was in the hands of religious Jews, worked fine. When it became "diverse", went to hell in a handbasket.

Judaism needs to give a lot more attention to the final commandment, and a lot less to boiling a young goat in its mother's milk, needs restore the Temple and the Kohen of the line of Mattathias.

Judaism is an obnoxious religion (though genuine Jewish believers are massively under represented among criminals, even in the crime of white collar fraud) because its exilic nature makes it hostile and angry.

Not what I see.
The ability of State Department NGOs to hire rentamobs to demand that the government does what it wants to do is collapsing, as Trump reduces their NGO funding.  He has not reduced by much, but even a small reduction has a large effect, because most of the money winds up being stolen by high placed leftists, rather than used to hire the river of meat.  The mobs are financed by what is left over, and a small reduction in the total means a large reduction in what is available to hire mobs.
Consider, for example, the mighty mob that protested the Keystone pipeline under Obama.
Remember all those mighty and entirely spontaneous protests demanding that the Obama regime do what it quite obviously wanted to do and was quite obviously looking for justifications for doing, protests demanding that the government block every form of energy production in every white country, which obstructions have made the US into an energy importer for sixty years or so.
And, of course, with deep reluctance the Obama regime would invariably yield to the justified and entirely spontaneous and genuine rage of the mighty masses. Overnight (well, over the first one hundred and fifty days of the Trump regime), the US became an energy exporter. Trump would repeal a regulation by executive order, and the next day coal miners would be digging coal, repeal another regulation, and the next day drillers would be pumping oil. One day he makes an executive order, the next day Americans in flyover country are back to work. The next day after that he makes another executive order, and the day after that, more Americans in flyover country are back to work.
You did not hear of this.
Probably because the mighty and justifiable enraged masses strangely failed to spontaneously show up to spontaneously demonstrate their might and spontaneous justified rage. They were always demanding that Obama shut down energy, but somehow, when Trump turns the energy policy of every previous Democratic and cuckservative president for the last sixty years arse over tit, no protests happen.
Funny thing that.
By increasing jobs in flyover country, and decreasing jobs in the big urban centers (his current tax bill soaks the big Democratic Party cities) Trump ensures that white males move to places where their votes are likely to make a difference, while the people living on crime and welfare are in big cities, which will vote democrat by ten to one, instead of five to one, so that though Democrats continue to import people to live on crime and welfare and voting Democrat, they don't actually effect the election outcome all that much, being wasted in voting districts that are already overwhelmingly Democratic.
Obama attempted to dump Islamic terrorists imported from Somalia on marginal electorates in flyover country, with some success, but they tended to up stakes and head for the bright lights of the big city, a far from marginal electorate.

Only if you declare all capitalists and all kulaks are thieves.  If one thinks that wealth earned from property and enterprise is legitimate, non Jewish white thieves are absolutely insignificant compared to thieves of every other major race.
And even if you declare that all capitalists are thieves, looks like the number and wealth of East Asian capitalists and kulaks is approximately equal to the number and wealth of non Jewish capitalists and kulaks.
"Hispanic" means that Angelo Mozilo got charge of a bank by affirmative action, and got other banks handed to his control by affirmative action.
Initially a white anglo guy had the real control, and Angelo Mozillo was just there for the bank to get favorable treatment by the regulators, the token minority with the big desk in the big office, but no meaningful stuff in his in tray, but then his sponsor retired, Angelo Mozilo got real charge of the bank, and totally screwed everything up.
And then he got real charge of a bunch of other banks, thanks to escalating favorable treatment by the regulators.
And then proceeded to run his bank, and the entire banking system, into the ground in the great Minority Mortgage Meltdown.  Subsequently he faced a bunch of criminal charges for numerous fraudulent activities, bribery, and corruption.  Hard to say if he was actually criminal and fraudulent, or just too hopelessly incompetent to do banking regulatory paperwork correctly and keep proper track of bank assets. (Which assets tended to disappear into his pockets and the pockets of the regulators, which tendency definitely hints at crime, fraud, and corruption, or at least a curious level of forgetfulness on his part and the part of the regulators.   Search for "Friends of Angelo" to get more details.)
You would be wrong:  CEO Citigroup who fucked up during the great mortgage minority meltdown and stole everything not nailed down, was Vikram Shankar Pandit, South Asian.
South Asians are massively over-represented when financial crime goes down, even more overrepresented than Jews.  Not that there are not plenty of Jews at Citigroup, but it seems that at Citigroup, the great Minority Mortgage Meltdown was a South Asian caper, not a Jewish caper.
Morgan Chase has a Jewish CRO, who is notoriously hostile to hasidic Jews, and notoriously ethnic nepotist towards reform Jews, but does not seem to be associated with anything obviously dishonest.  In particular, did not get his hands all that dirty during the great Minority Mortgage Meltdown, unlike his co-religionist, Jordan R. Belfort, also known as "the wolf of wall street"

That the thieves on wall street are predominantly Jewish, most notoriously Bernie Madoff, former Chairman of the NASDAQ stock market, is well known.
And of the thieves on wall street that are not Jewish, the remainder are for the most part middle easterners or South Asians.
Though I suspect that you classify *everyone* on wall street as a thief, in which case you will come to a different conclusion.  If you classify them all as thieves, Jews are still disproportionately over represented, but not by nearly as much.
Also, the second most notorious thief on Wall Street is Jon Corzine, who is undeniably white anglo saxon protestant, so Jews are not in themselves the problem.
If we had adequate enforcement, Jews would cut out their predatory misconduct.  The problem is not Jews, it is inadequate enforcement.  But just as if you allow people to commit burglary, you will find that most of your burglars look remarkably like Trayvon Martin, if you allow people to defraud investors, you will find that most of your fraudsters look remarkably like Bernie Madoff.
Similarly trading in "Binary Options".  That scam is as Jewish as a Bar Mitzvah.  Maybe other scams are not so one sidely Jewish - obviously Jon Corzine's operation in European debt were not especially Jewish, and the great Mortgage meltdown was primarily "white hispanic" rather than Jewish.

If you talk to any Cambodian, (a lot of donut shops seem to be operated by Cambodians) you will learn that several members of his family were murdered regardless of their real or imagined politics.
Which indicates total killings of several millions, approximately consistent with the new government's house to house survey and their exhumation of the killing fields.  The testimony of any one Cambodian proves that the new government's estimates are plausible, are in the right ballpark.
If you visit the Khmer Rouge killing fields, you will be shown evidence that guards who could read numbers were replaced by innumerate guards, indicating that the former guards were killed by the same apparatus of mass murder that they themselves operated, consistent with reports that towards the end of 1978, few Khmer Rouge remained, as a result of Khmer Rouge torturing other Khmer Rouge to death.
And if you yourself did not intend to torture tens of millions of Americans to death, you would have no inclination to deny the obvious and undeniable truth about the Khmer Rouge - and every radical left regime starting with the French Revolution.

Fascist governments most certainly do not advocate killing their own citizenry, but are apt to define "citizen" in an alarmingly narrow fashion. From her name, I would suspect that Marina might not necessarily be defined as a citizen were a fascist government take power in America.
Left wing governments generally advocate killing class enemies, or royalists, or aristocrats, and this time around will probably advocate killing "racists" and "sexists"
At the time that they start killing people belonging to this category, no one remains who believes that they belong to this category, but pretty soon, very large numbers of people belonging to this category are And soon after that, even larger numbers of such wicked people.
And not long after that, even more.
Right wing dictatorships generally forbid interest in politics.  As Charles the first told us, politics is the King's business and no one elses.  Thus right wing political killings are necessarily self limiting.  If you start killing large numbers of people for taking excessive interest in politics, people lose interest in politics.
Left wing dictatorships generally insist on interest in politics.  The personal is political.  Which rapidly becomes terrifying, and soon after that, increasingly terrifying.  Thus left wing political repression, unlike right wing political repression, is not self limiting.
Reflect on the infamous "Dear Colleague" letter from the Obama administration, recently rescinded by the Trump administration.
The practical effect of the letter is that if a third party deems some woman has been raped the evil rapists life must be very publicly destroyed without bothering with any inconveniences like charges, investigation, or evidence.
The circumstances leading to this letter was that we established the principle that women always tell the truth about rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment.
Well, actually we established the principle that women always lie when they deny rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment, but if a woman arguably changes her story during a struggle session after three big fat hairy lesbians have been screaming in her face for two hours straight, *then* she is telling the truth.
Hence the significance of the reference to "third parties" in the Dear Colleague letter. Note that the accused cannot cross examine the complainant, or even learn who the complainant is.
Recollect that when Crystal Mangum was detained by police for drunken violence after a night of industrious whoring, she gave numerous different stories, only one of which accused the Duke University sports team of rape, but the authorities insisted on going with the story that accused the sports team.  She could easily have been steered towards a less dramatic story, or steered to claiming flying saucer abduction, or best of all, steered to confessing to drunken violence after a night of industrious whoring.  But hey, if sexual violence is on the table, women are always the victims, and men always the aggressors, even if it needs two cops to restrain the "victim".
So if police catch a drunk woman in a criminal act, she just has to say "sexual assault, domestic abuse, domestic violence", and she is golden. Just as restraining illegal immigrants who murder white people for racial reasons might deter illegal immigrants from exercising their rights, restraining drunken violent women from criminal acts might deter them from complaining about sexual harassment and sexual violence.  And we cannot have that, can we?
We also saw this principle in operation in the safe space conflict.  If someone said something that might make a member of the umpteenth gender uncomfortable, no actual complainant of the umpteenth gender need to be produced, nor any evidence that a single member of the umpteenth gender exists anywhere near the incident. And what with "microaggression" the possibility of making someone of an ever increasing number of ever smaller categories uncomfortable expands without limit.

In context, Juan is probably referring to the claim that the Khmer Rouge murdered one hell of a lot Cambodians, and especially murdered the Khmer Rouge themselves.
The new government (nominally communist) did a house to house survey, asking people about disappearances.  Found about three million missing.
Which is consistent with what individual Cambodians I have met tell me, were telling people well before 1978 December.
Defenders of the Khmer Rouge regime claimed that was just commies defaming other commies.
The new government proceeded to dig up the killing fields.  Found a bit over two million people dumped in mass graves.

Before 1973 the Khmer Rouge were brutal totalitarian terrorists who infamous for sometimes practicing one way portage.
You need to transport supplies from A to B, so you round up some peasants at A and have them carry your stuff to B.  You don't feed them, but you tell them there will be food and water at B.  When you arrive at B, you kill them.
And of course, most tenured academics in the western world thought they were great guys, and if any tenured academic doubted it, he remained silent.  If there was a single tenured academic in the entire western world who doubted their goodness and greatness, he remained silent.
After 1973, the Khmer Rouge were brutal totalitarian terrorists who engaged in red terror, endlessly searching for imaginary capitalists, kulaks, capitalist roaders, elitists, and CIA agents.
And of course, most tenured academics in the western world thought they were great guys, and if any tenured academic doubted it, he remained silent.  If there was a single tenured academic in the entire western world who doubted their goodness and greatness, he remained silent.

And of course, most tenured academics in the western world thought they were great guys, and if any tenured academic doubted it, he remained silent.  If there was a single tenured academic in the entire western world who doubted their goodness and greatness, he remained silent.
Towards the end of 1978 the Khmer Rouge were running seriously short of Khmer Rouge, and those few who remained were generally under sentence of death by torture.
And of course, most tenured academics in the western world thought they were great guys, and if any tenured academic doubted it, he remained silent.  If there was a single tenured academic in the entire western world who doubted their goodness and greatness, he remained silent.
Towards the end of December 1978, or early in January 1979, the Khmer Rouge, those of them still alive, lost power.   And then every academic everywhere felt free to criticize the Khmer Rouge.
Which they did by claiming that the Khmer Rouge had been installed in power by Ronald Reagan and the CIA.

And if God did not ordain them, Darwin tells us that Gnon did.  And chances are that the will of Gnon was demonstrated where farming started, when someone first tried empire.  Irrespective of whether Babel actually existed or what happened there, farming would have led to the first city, the first city likely became the first Kingdom, the first Kingdom likely became the first empire, and then the proverbial would have hit the fan.

Buying something and selling it is not theft, nor is it a scam if the thing is as it is represented to be.
The thieving scammers were those who purchased houses with no intention or ability to repay the mortgage - people who purchased houses with no assets.  And you cannot purchase a house with no assets, unless you are a beneficiary of affirmative action.
Thus precisely zero white males or married white women were thieving scammers in housing boom.
The financial crisis was the result of dud mortgages.
The dud mortgages, all of them, were affirmative action mortgages.  What drove the housing boom is that *if* *you* *were* *a* *beneficiary* *of* *affirmative* *action* *then* you could buy an expensive house despite being stone broke.
The housing boom was the result of affirmative action mortgages.
White males were involved in this process only as flipping houses with the intent of unloading the houses on affirmative action purchasers.
A white male would buy a house with the intention and capability of paying the mortgage if things went bad, but with the expectation that he could unload on an affirmative action borrower before things went bad.
And for the most part, that is exactly what we did.
And the reason we chose to do this is that we know that white males are forced to honor contracts, while affirmative action beneficiaries can walk away with no problems.
So we, unlike the end purchasers, told the truth and honored all agreements.

But single white women were also able to borrow because of affirmative The intended beneficiaries of affirmative action were primarily blacks, but the actual beneficiaries were primarily hispanics, primarily recent illegal immigrant hispanics with very little ability to speak english, but yes, single women, some of them white, also got some of the gravy, and indeed a lot more of the gravy than blacks did.

Lots of white people, myself among them, flipped houses.
But from 2005 onwards to 2007, all the white people who flipped houses were unloading them on brown people, usually brown people with no income, no job, no assets, and no credit rating, in a large proportion of cases brown people with little English, in quite a few cases, brown people who tended to drink too much.
In a few cases, we unloaded them on white people, but still white people who were single white females, usually recent immigrants with  no income, no job, no assets, and no credit rating.
Nearly all of the end purchasers were brown and broke, and those were not brown and broke were single females and broke.

The reason the banks needed to be bailed out was affirmative action lending, that they were pressured to lend money to illegal immigrants with no income, no job, and no assets to buy million dollar houses in the Bay Area.
It is not exactly that they were forced to do it, though the Bank of Beverly Hills was destroyed because the regulators sensed insufficient enthusiasm for the program, which seems very close to forcing them to do it, rather it was politically correct to do it, and politically correct bankers, most infamously Angelo Mozilo, were empowered by the regulators to take over less politically correct bankers.

It follows there are five thousand African Americans smarter than me, fifty three thousand whites smarter than me.

Blacks differ from whites in many respects, not just IQ.  These differences make them inherently a separate tribe.  If they differed only in IQ, they could likely be assimilated, but they do not, one other big difference, one of many, being the propensity to criminal behavior.
Two tribes cannot coexist in the same territory.  One must rule, one must be ruled.  When we get ruled by blacks, cities burn.
Recall Obama saying "You did not build that"
Though, of course, we did build that.  Industrial civilization is the gift of whites to the world, along with the rule of law, and all that.
Now recall Juan saying what Obama said, but spelling out the implications: "a casual look at 'race' and crime shows that whites got the world record on crime."
Our crime being that we have a disproportionate share of the nice stuff, therefore, since we "did not build that", must have stolen it.
The remedy for this terrible theft being mass murder, since Juan in the same paragraph denies the crimes of the Pol Pot regime.
By the way, what race are you?  If Trayvon Martin caught you alone would he attack you on the basis of your race?
Would Obama hold the police back while a mob of blacks burned down your home and business as he did in Ferguson, because 'You did not build that".

If so, you will not get far using that argument against affirmative action.

If you complain that that this is racist, if you complain when a pack of blacks who are biologically adults, even though the same chronological age as your son, beat him up, you will be called a racist, no matter how piously you condemn me.
"Racist" is just a hate word for "white".  When you call me a racist, it is no different from you calling a black man a nigger, or a Jew a kike. It is just an angry hateful word for people of a particular ethnic group.  Observe that no one called Trayvon Martin a racist even though the he indicated to his girlfriend that the fact that Zimmerman was light skinned was a major reason Martin decided to attack Zimmerman.
Because Martin Trayvon was not racist.
When a gang of blacks beat up a white man because he is white, that is not racism, that is anti racism.  Everyone instinctively calls it anti racism.  Because that is what it is.
No one is going to spontaneously call Martin Trayvon "racist" because he was in the habit of physically attacking people for being lighter skinned than himself, any more than they are going to call me "gay" for being light hearted and happy.

g2s is trying to manufacture tribalism on the basis of covetousness, envy, and theft.
Libertarianism is a response to this effort
The left wing effort to turn econonomic categories into tribes was never terribly successful, and now the left is more focused on trying to generate tribalism on the basis of sexual identity and race, generate tribalism on the basis of actually existent tribes.
Which is a lot more successful.
Also a lot more likely to lead to genocide.
Libertarianism is paralyzed by this turn, which renders libertarianism Instead of stealing the bakery, or price controlling baker's inputs and outputs, they demand the baker cheer at a gay wedding.
Which, on the face of it, does not directly lead to mass murder the way stealing, covetousness, and envy does.
But fighting over status is just as likely, indeed more likely to turn deadly as fighting over stuff.
It has become apparent that there is no stopping point.  Males are just naturally superior to women in the male sphere, and white males are just naturally superior to nonwhites in most spheres.
This results in endless, and endlessly escalating efforts, to crush this natural superiority.  And this endless escalation has no stopping point but genocide.
OK, white men cannot jump and cannot dance, and our running is seriously underwhelming, but in most spheres, obviously superior.  In particular and especially, white males are superior soldiers to any other race by far. Notice the hilarious underperformance of the black posterboys of both sides in the civil war.  Similarly, notice that any military that incorporates females as soldiers never wins a war against a military that does not, irrespective of the races.  You might argue that the Vietnam war was a counter example to this, but that was a proxy war between the blue empire and the red empire, whites fighting over browns, rather than with browns.
Today's chinese art is obviously superior to today's white art, but this reflects our current decadence.  China is coming out of a dark age, while we are sliding into a dark age.   Some blame the Jews for the current undeniably crappy state of white art.  But the Chinese always had good art, even in their dark age.    We have done better in the past than now, but OK, whites are not obviously better than East Asians at art, and it is plausible that East Asians are better at art than whites.
Whites, on the other hand, are better at technological creativity than anyone, even East Asians (though the Japanese are pretty good), and, closely related to this, better at war.  The current technological superiority of East Asia is substantially dependent on white and Eurasian emigres, among them emigres fleeing the tribal violence and political repression in California and Silicon Valley.
The current white inferiority at war is the result of women in the military.   If we return to the early nineteenth century style army, where logistics are classified as camp followers rather than soldiers, and part of the duty of camp followers is getting soldier's dicks wet, where the soldiers are all male and the camp followers disproportionately female, we will return to winning.

There is in fact a negative relationship between political contributions and above market profits.
This suggests that when politicians want some contributions, they threaten to harm a business, and then get paid to leave them alone.
Thus, for example, the upsurge in political correctness, political censorship, and massive political contributions by silicon valley corporations reflects the end of the Silicon Valley exemption.  Silicon valley used to be able to get away with meritocracy, unlike the rest of America, but now the eye of Sauron has fallen upon it.  We would expect this to decrease, rather than increase, the profitability of Silicon Valley, and that indeed is what has happened.

Free Trade for corporations big enough to own a skyscraper in a major city and fill it full of lawyers. Lesser businesses would find themselves criminals because of a thousand pages of regulation that no one reads and no one understands, least of all those enforcing it.
The practical consequence of the Transpacific Partnership would have been regulation by far away bureaucrats rather than near at hand bureaucrats.

Kill (or expel, or somehow make sure that everyone from group X is just not around any more) is a very common tactic, and one that is with great regularity hugely successful.
It gets massively under reported, because it embarrasses the winners. But if you look at demographics and voting patterns, it is obvious that there has been a huge amount of it going on, and it works just great for group not-x.
Forswearing this popular and hugely successful tactic when other groups do not forswear it is unilateral disarmament.
Other groups will not abandon it unless it looks likely to produce blowback on them.
Stuff like whites getting expelled from Detroit, Christians from the middle east, etc is not going to stop unless we start doing similar operations on blacks and Muslims etc.
In any situation where it is probable that group x is going to do us, we need to do them first.  Then after few massacres and genocides, and possibly numerous nuclear explosions, then maybe then we can make a more stable and safe arrangement, but we are not going to get a more stable and safe arrangement as long as members of group X can get rid of whites, capitalists, Christians, etc, and never have any fear that that whites, capitalists, Christians, etc, will return the favor.
No one is motivated to reduce the likelihood of this tactic being used, as long as one side gets deemed to be good guys when they use it, and the other side bad guys when they resist it.
Unilaterally forswearing this ever popular and successful tactic does not mean that there will be less of it, it means there will be more of it.

Enslavement on the basis of war was generally result of pacification campaigns, rather than "slave raids" - kings enslaved those who were persistently causing them trouble, with the objective of deterring troublemakers and getting rid of them.  As, for example, the Irish.
And most enslavement was not on the basis of war.  It was more typically for petty theft, particularly stealing from one's employer, and vagrancy.  (Not having visible means of support.)
Slavery was driven by supply, rather than demand.  It was a way of dealing with problem people.  And Africa had, and still has, more problem people.
Walk down the street.  You will notice that black Americans generally have smaller heads, reflecting smaller brains.  Thus require more supervision, and are less apt to voluntarily accept supervision.
People who need supervision, and are disinclined to accept it, cause problems.  Slavery was a way of dealing with those problems.

There were raiding parties, but where we have data, which we generally don't, most slaves were purchased from the local authorities, not captured in raids.  So who were the local authorities selling?
Until recently, very few societies used imprisonment (and I would argue imprisonment is a very bad idea and we should not use it either.)  If someone caused problems, you beat him or killed him.  Suppose you beat him, and later he causes problems some more.  What are you going to do? You can kill him, or you can sell him into slavery.
Early colonialists and explorers report executions, lots of executions, lots and lots of executions, rather than enslavement.By and large, there seem to have been more executions than selling people into slavery. Black societies had more people that they did not want around, than they had purchasers for slaves.

Most blacks in prison in the bay area have terrifyingly violent criminal records.  They don't jail blacks except for persistent, repeated, and serious crimes.
By and large, the milder law enforement, the greater the disparity in black and white imprisonment rates.
Blacks commit the great majority of violent crimes and face to face robberies, though the disparity for killing people is less extreme.
Black criminality is also more responsive to law enforcement than white criminality.  Where law enforcement is firm and harsh, blacks shape up. Under a sufficiently severe regime, blacks are actually more law abiding than whites - but by modern standards, such a regime is remarkably severe.

Marksmanship also abandoned.
Turns out that the typical highly trained female "soldier" is more than one standard deviation below the typical male soldier in marksmanship, even though no upper body strength is required, just hand eye coordination, which you would think females would be better at.
Substantially higher variance in female marksmanship though, which means that among the very best marksmen, the difference is considerably less.
With white and black criminality, the mean for black criminality is way higher than the mean for white, but the variance is way lower.  Hence the good behavior of blacks in societies with draconian law enforcement, and the bad behavior of Harvard blacks earning six figure incomes.
We saw a similar situation with Indian engineers in Silicon valley. Indian engineers were a disaster, still are.  Instead of debugging the program, they deprogrammed the bugs.  They ran Informix, and several other companies into the ground.  Stuff just did not work, and customers would not take it.
But then Trump cracked the whip, and told Silicon Valley companies (who hate him) that they cannot import Indian software engineers unless they are truly exceptional.
And with Trump holding a gun to heads of Silicon Valley companies, it turned out that there is high variance among Indian software engineers, higher variance than among American engineers - that there are a lot of very smart Indian software engineers, truly exceptional engineers, that somehow Silicon valley did not care about when it was free to import typical average Indian software engineers.
Pretty sure, however, that though there seem to be plenty of exceptional, and formerly ignored, Indian engineers now that Silicon Valley is forced, very much against their will, to search for them, there are no exceptional women that can carry a hundred pound weapon system thirty kilometers.

World Trade Center Building Seven fell after seven hours of uncontrolled fire, which is roughly what one would expect, and it fell largely sideways, not on its own footprint, which is roughly what one would expect in collapse by fire,  and it fell piece by piece, not all at the same time, with the outer shell collapsing after everything else, after the innards were gutted by internal collapses, which is roughly what one would expect in a building where the inner floors had a lower fire rating than the columns.
And when the outer shell finally collapsed, it started its fall by tilting sideways to the south like a tree notched by a woodman, which is what one would expect in a building that suffered massive damage on the south side, though the primary cause of the collapse was the fire, not the notch on the south side.

Lie.  World Trade Center Building Seven Fell slowly at first.  The penthouse fell first, then the entire outer frame of the building tilted to the south like a falling tree.  The penthouse wound up on the building's footprint, but the outer frame of the building wound up well south of the building's footprint.
The outer frame of the building did not go into free fall until after it had rotated a considerable distance south, like a tree leaning towards the notch cut by the axeman.
The fall eventually went into free fall downwards, but it started out by falling sideways like a tree
The details are complicated, but the basic story is simple:
Steel frame construction, massive damage on the South side, out of control fires raging for seven hours on steel columns only rated for three hours.  The interior of the building collapsed, and then shortly afterwards, the outer shell of the building fell sideways towards the South like a tree.
If you throw a rock at a glass window, it will shatter in a complicated way and if you want to explain the particular details of the shattering you wind up with a complicated explanation, but the basic story is simple:
Smash a big hole in a tall steel frame building, set it on fire. Deactivate the water sprinkers and send the fire fighters away to deal with more urgent matters, and eventually that building will fall.

World Trade Center Building Seven fell in large part because fires raged uncontrolled for seven hours.  Steel frame buildings just are not designed to handle really prolonged fires.  This is a well known issue that people who build tall buildings talk about and design around all the time.

The tilt is not minor.  It is the major part of the initial movement, possibly the entirety of the initial movement.
The penthouse does not collapse into the building.  Rather it goes out of sight because the building is tilting away from the camera to the south.
The image below, shot from the east side, shows it half way through its fall, transitioning from falling sideways like a tree, to collapsing downwards like a building.
After about two or three seconds into the collapse it starts to fall downwards, as if in a demolition, but the start of the collapse is that building seven tilts and rotates sideways like a tree falling towards the notch cut by the axeman.

Not what those pictures show.
Notice the dark line on the side of the building.  It is tilting.
In the final image, the part of the line furthest from you, south end, has dropped as much as the penthouse, while the part of the line closest to you, north end, has dropped as much as the front of the building.
Measure it.
This shows that penthouse is not collapsing inside the building, the entire building is tilting away from you like a falling tree, tilting towards the holes blasted into the south side of the building by the planes piloted by the terrorists, like a tree falling over towards the notch cut by the axeman.
In any case, World Trade Tower was only designed to survive three hours of uncontrolled fire before the steel softened and the building fell. Because of the damage done by the planes, there was no water, with the result that the building experienced seven hours of uncontrolled fire, before falling.

Massive damage strips the insulation, fire burns, cool at first, but shortly before the collapse, burns red hot, yellow hot.  Yellow hot fire is going to turn uninsulated steel into noodles.
Part of the structure was smashed, then more of the structure was subject to fire.  The fire got hotter. When it went yellow hot, hot enough to drastically weaken steel, building collapsed.

The fire heated materials to yellow hot in daylight.  The fire was hot enough for the glow to be clearly visible in daylight, which is the most intense fire you can get with jet fuel and ordinary combustion.
A fire this hot is achievable, but hard to achieve, in an ordinary barbecue.  Hard to achieve with wood, but if you throw kerosene, which is the same stuff as jet fuel, on the wood in the barbecue easy to achieve with wood.

When you guys tell us that there was molten iron pouring out of the two tower, you knowingly lie about what the videos plainly show.

The purpose of these lies is to deny the culpability of Robert Mueller, and to persuade us that importing millions of young male military age Muslims from Saharan Africa and dumping them on marginal federal electorates is not a problem.
Video shows Flight 77 flying into the Pentagon at almost ground level, and small bits of Flight 77 and its passengers were sprayed all over the Pentagon.  Small spatters of the passengers' bones are still turning up in the Pentagon.
Video shows the towers falling like trees, not like demolitions, particularly Trade Tower Seven.  Each tower starts its fall by leaning sideways into the hole smashed by the plane, like a tree notched by the axe man. Each tower starts by falling sideways like a tree notched by the axe man, and *then* goes into free fall.
The video showing burning fluid pouring out of the Trade Tower shows a stream of burning jet fuel carrying burning seat cushions and burning body parts.  The liquid pouring out is only flame hot and flame bright, not molten iron hot and molten iron bright.
Real molten iron is too bright to be viewed with the naked eye, so bright as to be very difficult to video.  If you look at videos of real molten iron pours, the intense light of molten iron overwhelms the camera, intensely illuminating everything around it, so that near the molten iron the light is too bright to register, looking like a Star Wars light saber, rather than a fluid or a flame, and away from the molten iron, full sunlight looks like darkness, as the camera or the camera operator turns its sensitivity down to minimum to avoid damage. Similarly, thermite.  If there was "nano thermite" or "thermate" involved in the fall of the towers, it would have been obvious.
I have seen real molten iron pours, and they look like most videos of molten iron pouring - blinding the eyes in the same way as they blind the cameras.  To video molten iron, you have to video it through welding goggles.  If you look at a Youtube video of molten iron taken in full sunlight by an ordinary camera without special measures, the sunlight turns to darkness as the camera attempts to accommodate the molten iron, and it still cannot accommodate the molten iron.
You knowingly lie about all these things, and proof that you know you are lying is that you do not link to the video evidence, you link to videos of talking heads telling lies about the video evidence.  If you genuinely thought that the videos show what you say they show, you would link to the videos themselves, rather than linking to videos of liars talking about what the videos supposedly show.  If there was thermite and such in the fall of the towers, we would not need talking heads to tell us what we were seeing.  Everyone would have seen it.
You are lying to cover the misconduct of Robert Mueller, and in defense of the Deep State / Democratic Party program of race replacement, in particular their program of moving vast numbers of black male Muslim military age rapist voters into marginal federal electorates.

During the twentieth century, approximately one hundred million to one hundred and seventy million people were politically murdered.
A great many Jews were wrongfully killed, but those crimes need to be put in their proper perspective, and their proper perspective is that these were an absolutely trivial, boring, and insignificant part of the crimes of the twentieth century, that Jews have gone completely overboard in absurd and excessively inventive elaborations of the crimes committed against them, that the crimes committed against the Jews are such a minor part of the enormous crimes of the twentieth century that they should only be remembered in the footnotes of long and dusty history books.
The ingenious elaboration of the crimes against the Jews is part of a campaign to obfuscate the reality that the crimes of the twentieth century were a result of covetousness and envy.  There is no such thing as racism, for if their was such a thing, we would have had a word for it before the twentieth century.

If a shopkeeper chosen to be the archetypal victim, would have been too obvious that the problem was leftism, which is to say that the problem was covetousness and envy.  The similarity between Krystalnacht in Nazi Germany, and what is happening today to mostly lighter skinned shopkeepers in Venezuela and to white farmers in South Africa would have been embarrassingly obvious.  Ann Frank's diary was concocted to hide the resemblance.
The gas chambers were invented to make the deaths of Jews under Nazism as different as possible from the deaths of (disproportionately Jewish) intellectuals and businessmen under communism.

Show us a link to a leftist admitting the Cambodian Autogenocide before 1978 December 25th, or to a leftist denying the Cambodian Autogenocide after 1979 February 16th.
Every single leftist every where, in the sense that any leftist anywhere who deviated from the party line was promptly denounced and purged, every tenured Academic everywhere, in the sense that there was not one dissenting voice in all of tenured Academia in the entire world, lied about the Cambodian Autogenocide until 1979 January the eighth, when Phnom Penh fell to the Vietnamese, whereupon every leftist every where turned on a dime, admitted the Cambodian Autogenocide and started blaming it on the CIA,

And here is Chomsky supporting and denying the Cambodian autogenocide while millions of refugees fled the terror:
Shortly before he denounced it with equal vigor - denounced it not because any new facts had become available, but because the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia now needed to justified.
That is exactly what you guys, for example Chomsky,  were saying about Khmer Rouge Cambodia, until suddenly you started saying the opposite about Cambodia, because it suddenly became convenient to do so.
You lie, you lie in support of mass murderers, because you intend to commit mass murder.

The left passionately denied the bloodbath in Cambodia as they passionately denied the bloodbath in Vietnam:
They only admitted to the bloodbath when Vietnam successfully invaded Cambodia - and only then did they blame it somehow on the Americans.
Back then when Chomsky and Herman wrote, the left, myself among them, all knew that something terrible was happening in Vietnam, though most now claim to remember otherwise. Today even Chomsky himself now remembers that no one in the press even suggested such a thing [12], though back then two months before he and Herman so indignantly complained of the failure to report the bloodbath as âmissingâ. the National Review told us [13]:
"THE BLOODBATH is motivated not so much by hatred or revenge as by the necessity for the Communist system to purge itself of undesirable elements From a Marxist viewpoint political purge is a necessity in order to achieve political purity, a precondition to the building of socialism. Political purity ensures single mindedness, which in turn achieves high efficiency. The Vietnamese Communists, as they showed in their conduct of the war, are doctrinaire single minded, efficient. But not until all Vietnamese men, women, and children think the Communist way will political purity be achieved for the new nation as a whole. This is why indoctrination (âre-educationâ as they call it) is of prime importance. For those who are too old or too stubborn to change elimination is the only alternative."
The crimes committed by the North Vietnamese regime against the Vietnamese people were smaller than the crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge against the Cambodians, but for us on the left they were emotionally far more significant.
When these Vietnamese crimes became known, the reaction of the left was ignore the facts, the details and evidence of the accusations, and attack the messenger, a reaction that was strikingly inconsistent with our self image as the conscience of the world, our image of ourselves as people who cared deeply about the welfare of faraway strangers. Today, most of the radical left comfortably remember these accusations that they so venomously and savagely condemned as never having been made.

This supposedly ancient tradition seems to be nineteenth century with some rather thin justifications claiming it is twelfth century.
It is clearly post biblical.  It was not in effect during the fourth century, when in the event of real or reasonably suspected sexual misconduct, the offenders got "sanctified" like it or not.
Women rather like serial monogamy.  If women get sexual choice, if they are free to always be on the prowl to trade up, rather than stuck with the first guy they have sex with, you get women defecting on men, men respond by defecting on women first (spin plates) in the reasonable expectation that women are likely to defect on them, so you always need a few spares in the kitty.
So, have to enforce on women the old testament rule that they are stuck with the first guy they have sex with.
If you enforce that rule, then in an alarmingly large minority of cases, you will find that the first guy they have sex with, they have sex with him at a disturbingly young age, Disney  princess age, well before puberty.
Thus societies that attempt to enforce that rule tend to lock up their daughters starting one or two years before Disney princess age, but this fails surprisingly often, so if you attempt enforce virgin marriage, you really have to allow marriage long before puberty in problem cases, and indeed quite forcefully impose marriage long before puberty in a minority of problem cases.

The supposedly Jewish tradition that girls were not women is far from ancient.  Nineteenth century at earliest.
Ancient Judaism, fourth century, had no lower age limit on marriage, and generally dealt with sexual misconduct by shotgun marrying the offenders, ("sanctifying" them) regardless of age, including female offenders as young as three.  It was youthful male offenders who were excused from marriage on the grounds that it was obviously physically impossible for them to have done what they seemed to be doing.
That supposedly ancient tradition is twenty first century.  It is not even twentieth century.  Rabbis are always inventing ancient traditions as of last week, and falsely attributing them to some ancient source.
The Sadducees were complaining about this rabbinical creativity back in second temple times, and the rabbis have been at it ever since the Maccabees lost their grip, endlessly and rapidly re-inventing the past of judaism, usually in accord with current year values.

Trump's vulgarity conveys a vital and important truth.
No one gets charged with rape for actually raping women, no one gets charged with sexual harassment for actually sexually harassing women.
If you are sufficiently alpha, you *can* grab them by the pussy.
Casual observation and common sense is that all charges of sexual harassment are lustful women shit testing hapless timid men, and those timid men failing their shit tests.
This anecdotal evidence is confirmed by statistical evidence, in that female majority workplaces have a much larger proportion of females claiming sexual harassment than male majority workplaces.
Similarly, most rape complaints are actually lack of rape complaints.
The university of Virginia dealt with a big pile of rape and sex complaints, and dismissed every single one without disciplinary action. So Rolling Stone investigated University of Virginia looking for poster girls and trouble, came up empty.
Worse than empty, came up with what was very obviously some woman's rape fantasy.  As I said when the "rape on campus" article first appeared, it read as if typed up one handed.  Reading the article, it was obvious that if there really was a college fraternity of high status white males who were so high status they could get away with brutally and savagely glass raping women, and so manly that they were apt to do so, the women who wrote the article would be hanging around the frat house with glasses in both hands.
Similarly Crystal Mangum had semen from five men in her when she complained of being raped by the Lacrossw team - none of it from members of the Lacrosse team.
Chances are if the Lacrosse team had gang banged her good and hard they would have had no problems, for the guys who did gang bang her good and hard had no problems.

Venezuela is blocking US aid, possibly because it suspects it to be a Trojan horse, which it frequently is.
The media are accurately reporting that the government of a starving country is blocking aid for its starving people.
If anything, the media are displaying a pro Venezuela bias in neglecting to report that the Venezuelan government is sitting on a lake of oil, which it lacks the competence to pump, and a mountain of gold, that it lacks the competence to mine.
I hope that the purpose of this intervention is get the oil pumped and the gold mined, rather than install democracy, because past efforts to install democracy have been disastrous, with the voters of each newly created democracy voting to destroy the economy and make war on their neighbors and each other.  The place would obviously be much better off as a division of ExxonMobile.
Venezuela is starving because they democratically voted to loot the bakeries, and if democracy is reinstalled, probably will vote for the same thing again.

Obviously point to point and one to many communication is liberating, as we can tell by the efforts of terror states to control them.
The primary threat to privacy today is giant corporations in the pocket of the government sweet talking private individuals into *voluntarily* handing over their data.  For example viber by default backs up all your viber messages in the clear to google drive, where the greatest AI in the world does a pattern match for topics of interest.
But, on the other hand, encryption and point to point communication is inherently resistant to the state.  I just did a bunch of transactions by bitcoin that were either politically incorrect, circumvented government regulation, or both.  Bitcoin plus encrypted messaging gives me liberty that no one used to have.
Twitter censors, but gab does not.  Viber theoretically encrypts, but then cheerfully backs up all your messages in the clear to the worst possible location, but Whatsapp really is encrypted.

Cleaning up the FBI is a counter coup, an autocoup.  In a counter coup, you don't show your hand till you are in a position to nail the traitor's hides to the wall and survive doing so.
Black pilling on Trump bringing the jobs back was a mistake.  Black pilling on Syria turned out to be a mistake.  Black pilling on the wall turned out to be a mistake.  Black pilling on legal immigration and H-1B turned out to be a mistake.
Let's not black pill on cleaning up the FBI and draining the swamp.  We now have dueling investigations into the latest suicide of someone who knew too much about the Clintons.
Epstein knew too much about too many important and powerful people.
In particular he knew too much about the Clintons.
His continuing usefulness depended on him being pals with Trump, and thus potentially having the goods on Trump.  The mainstream media was salivating over the Trump connection.   So they put the heat on him to give them the goods on Trump.  And then it comes out that though he says he is pals with Trump, though he told his girls he was pals with Trump, they never saw Trump palling with him.
Hence not useful.  And, a few hours after this comes out, a few hours after it becomes known he is not useful, there is a convenient camera malfunction and he hangs himself in a room with nothing to hang himself Yet another tragic suicide by someone who knows stuff about the Clintons.
The connection with Israel is that Epstein was blackmailing a wealthy Jew who had connections with Israel. (That Jew claims that Epstein was embezzling from him, but strangely took no action to prosecute that supposed embezzlement) That is a mighty thin connection to Israel, but there is a mighty thick connection to the Clintons, to Mueller, and to the FBI.
And there is, of course, a long history of the FBI doing dirty work for the Clintons.
Whenever the FBI is caught up to no good, they are apt to blame Mossad and the Jews, as with Mueller's "Dancing Israelis", (though lately Mueller has been blaming Russian Trolls).
So when someone implies that Mossad abducted Epstein or murdered Epstein, I suspect that the person telling me this is an FBI shill, and that the FBI murdered Epstein to shut him up.

I was at ground center of the great minority mortgage meltdown, sunnyvale california.
In 2005, every purchase was a million dollar purchase by a cat eating no-hablo-english hispanic with no job, no income, and no assets, that no normal person would lend five dollars to for a hamburger.
If you look at the location of the defaults in 2009, they are all in hispanic, or black and hispanic areas.
Those guys did not have trillions to transfer to wall street scum.
Those loans were issued largely to stony broke hispanics by hispanics affirmative actioned into power over white people's money, the most infamous hispanic, the one who pissed away more white people's money than anyone else, was Angelo Mozillo.
What happened was that trillions of dollars were pissed away on minority loans, and then the banks received a trillion dollar bailout, and no one dared point to where the money was lost.
You do know.  It is because complaints about sexual harassment are caused by the lack of sexual harassment, not the presence of sexual harassment, the same pattern we notice with Muslim rape versus fraternity rape, but you cannot say that because the HR department of the organization that is paying you to make these posts would fire you.
And yet, you are unable to notice female shit tests, because that is a firing offense, while being "anti feminazi" is not a firing offense.
If you are anti feminazi, tell us about shit tests in the workplace.  I see a whole lot of disruptive shit testing in the workplace.  Companies go down the tubes in shit tests.  If you are anti feminazi, tell us about that.

You are employed to shill communism to anarcho capitalists, in the same way that so many pastors are employed to shill gay sex, divorce, and fatherlessness to Christians, and the FBI employs so many people posing as anti semites to attack Trump.  And your place of employment has an HR department that prevents same thought crimes as every other HR department prevents.

Subsaharan Africans in Africa, who never experienced slavery, behave worse than whites, (check the murder rates) and some kinds of Africans behave worse than others.
While subsaharan Africans are inherently worse behaved than whites, there is a marked difference  between those who came here as slaves, and those who came here under their own power.
When those blacks that sold their brethren to us migrate to the US under their own power, they and their children are far better behaved than the descendants of those that they sold, even though their children are raised in exactly the same environment.
The problem is obviously a genetic propensity to bad conduct, a propensity considerably worse among the those descended from those who got enslaved for hunting other people's cattle and gathering from other people's gardens.

Jews vote on their ethnicity, not on their economic class.  The problem is not that I am "racist", but that every voting block mobilized by the Democrats is "racist".
Persuade them of that.
Reactionaries don't believe in the Marxist class analysis, neither did Lysander Spooner, whom you claim to be an adherent of.
The reactionary class categorization is priests (including professors, the mainstream media, public intellectuals, lawyers, judges, etc) warriors (including officers, soldiers, police, rentacops, mercs, etc) merchants (capitalists, entrepeneurs, businessmen, and such) and the masses.
In which categorization I am primarily a merchant, trying out for the priesthood.  But I spend more time on merchant stuff.

You interpret Lysander Spooner as a commie.  I interpret him otherwise.
I was an anarcho capitalist, but as tribalism grew, I realized that anarcho capitalism was incapable of defending itself against tribes and religions (defining religions broadly, as I have defined priests broadly, to include communism and progressivism)
Something like anarchocapitalism worked in saga period Iceland because it was a state enforced theocracy, and the official religion upheld the right of every man to himself avenge wrongs done to him - the official religion denied the state the monopoly of legitimate of violence.  The fragility of that system became apparent when Christianity hit them.
  I have therefore come to the conclusion that the best system is a long established and stable monarchy, as exemplified by the Emirate of Dubai, and such monarchies can only grow out of military dictatorship.  So I now favor military dictatorship, thinly disguised as the Republic, for America, as Augustus become military dictator of Rome, under a thin disguise of the Republic continuing.
Which is the usual outcome when democracy self destructs, as it is self destructing now.
The outcome I hope for is Holy American Emperor Trump, King under God, but a more likely and more readily achievable outcome is God Emperor Trump.
And a far more likely outcome than either of those is a long period of chaos and ruin.
One King three thousand miles is a lesser problem than a thousand kings three miles away. The loss of cohesion in the ruling elite leads to anarcho tyranny, not anarcho capitalism.  Yesterday I was trying to transfer a sum of money while avoiding tax impact, and one bank thought the legalities worked one way, and the other bank thought the legalities worked a different way, and they could not agree because the laws and regulations are complicated, intrusive, obscure, incomprehensible, there is no one who actually knows what that mean, except that no matter what you do, if they want to charge you with something, they will probably find something to charge you with.
What the french left supported in place of monarchy, feudalism, and theocracy was terror, mass murder, socialism, total war, and the enlightenment, the enlightenment being a state imposed religion immensely more destructive than Christianity.
 > So AGAIN, why does jim.com pretend to be libertarian when you are
 > a RIGHT WINGER, AND SO A MONARCHIST?
I want liberty.
If you want liberty, China is better than the US, but Dubai (Monarchy) and Thailand (Monarchy plus military dictatorship) a lot better than either the US or China.
The greatest period of liberty was England from 1660 to 1820, when Kings had real power.

When war comes, the brown democrats will see Jews as white Europeans, as you do, but this is going to come as a mighty big shock to a great many Many, probably most Jews, do not think of themselves as white Europeans.
And as we drift towards tribal war, one of the major failure modes of democracy, this matters a lot.  People are voting and organizing on race, ethnicity, tribe, and religion, not class.
The Holodomor, which murdered about ten million or so, was in substantial part caused by Jewish animus towards Christians.
Note also the historical tendency of Jews to back Muslims in the never ending war between Christians and Muslims, even though Jews have only ever prospered under Christian rule.
Similarly observe Jewish support for the Islamic conquest of Europe, even though it is absolutely obvious that Muslims are already beginning to expel Jews from Europe.  This echoes the similarly self destructive Jewish behavior during the crusades.  It always seems to come as shock to Jews when they ally with anti Christian factions, and the anti Christian factions do not ally back.  In the crusades, the Jews supported the Muslims, but the Muslims did not support the Jews, a story that the brown Democrats are now re-enacting.
And if, not what 'race' do you think they belong to?
What matters is not what race I think they belong to, but what race they think they belong to.
There is always a ruling class.  The problem is that our ruling class is losing internal cohesion, partly due to tribalization, and partly due to loss of moral character in our ruling class.
The purpose of political correctness is to humiliate and degrade by demanding that people accept an obvious lie, thus demonstrating who has the power and who shall submit.
Point deer, make horse. PC is the opposite of the old honor codes. Instead of an honor code, we have a dishonor code. Instead of compliance testing young potential elite members for courage, honor, and dignity, we compliance test them for cowardice, lying, and groveling.  And so we get a ruling elite that fails to hold together.
Right and left were defined in the FrenchRevolution.
Left is the party for knocking over the apple cart to grab some apples. They loudly announce that this will produce an abundance of apples, and for a short while it does.  Right is the party of order, as exemplified in the French Revolution.
When a mysterious apple shortage ensues, they launch a hunt for the witches casting the magic spells causing the mysterious shortage of apples, and a hunt for some more apple carts to knock over.  Thus most of the people murdered in the French Revolution were not aristocrats, but rather people accused of "hoarding", "profiteering", and ""price gouging".  Typically bakers and peasants.
This not only describes socialism, but also such innovations as the sexual revolution and the destruction of marriage.  They figured that men would get more sex, but most men are getting less sex.

Democracy has been tried before.  It always self destructs much the way it is self destructing now, leading, after a longer or shorter period of chaos and ruin, to rule by Caesar.
One of the common modes of self destruction is that people vote their tribe, ethnicity, race, and religion, which eventually results in tribal warfare and the recreation of states with a common race and religion, which is the failure mode that we are entering into now.
The reactionary movement is people positioning themselves for the coming end of democracy.  We hope to survive it, we hope for our children to survive it, and our politics and plots are aimed at making the transition shorter, smoother, and less bloody.  We look at how people in the past have successfully dealt with the problems we are now encountering, and look at the past how people in the past have bloodily and catastrophically responded unwisely to the problems we are encountering now, to learn from past success and past failure.
Trump as holy American Emperor (King under God) would be the ideal solution, God Emperor Trump (cult of personality and all that) a more realistic and practical solution, but a long period of bloody chaos is more realistic and likely.  Trump is a deal maker, not a warrior, therefore not the best candidate for God Emperor.  But war approaches, and you go with the leader you have, not the leader you want.

Leftism is defection against near, and alliance with far in order to destroy near.
Thus white leftists ally with none whites in order to destroy their nearby white enemies in the pursuit of power.  Democrats import non whites to live on crime, welfare, and voting democrat, without thinking beyond the next election.  Hatred of white males is the KKKrazy glue that holds the Democratic Party coalition of the fringes together.  To seize despotic power and loot the country, you need an enemy, and the deplorables in flyover country have been nominated as the enemy, much as Trotsky nominated the more successful peasants.
Without that KKKrazy glue, the mestizo portion of the Democrat coalition would be shooting  the black portion of the Democrat coalition in the streets, and the Muslim portion of the Democrat coalition would be tossing the gay portion of the Democrat coalition from high buildings.
Thus, for example, the Populares, who wanted a more democratic Roman Empire, allied with the Samnites, who wanted to kill every Roman male and overthrow the walls of Rome.  And similarly the Democracy protestors in China ally with the USG state department (far), who want China to return to poverty and chaos.
Facebook is controlled by a Jew, and Jews notoriously fail to identify as white, and delusively imagine that the pets that they have affirmative actioned into positions of power will go along with Jews adopting white or nonwhite identity as convenient at any given moment, hence the Jewish enthusiasm for the Islamic conquest of Europe, even though it is obvious that they will be the next to be liquidated.
The Jew Trotsky, a failed urban money lender, told the peasants that he too was a peasant, and their real enemy was the kulak, that the enemy of the peasant with one cow was the peasant with two cows.  Meanwhile he told the Jews that he too was a Jew, and that together with him, they would murder the peasants - except that he soon noticed it was more lucrative to torture the Jew for hoarded gold coins, than to torture the peasant for buried seed corn, and the disproportionately Jewish Russian communists wound up murdering far more Jews than Hitler did.
Trotskyists, who are mostly Jewish, hate Jews more than Nazis do, just as white Democrats hate whites.

In the past year, all of the following headlines have appeared, in well-read publications:
What is new is the direct indictment of white people as a race. This happened through a strange rhetorical transformation over the past few years. At first, âwhite men are our greatest threatâ postings tended to be ironic, a way of putting the racist shoe on the other foot. They were meant to show that blaming an entire race for the harmful actions of a few individuals is senseless.
Then the tenor changed. What started as irony turned into an actual belief that white people, specifically white men, are more dangerous and immoral than any other people, and that systematic state discrimination against them is therefore moral, necessary, virtuous, and deserved.

White people are second class citizens.
A white person does not dare be rude to a nonwhite, but it is just fine for nonwhites to be rude to whites.
Police are more likely to shoot whites in a confrontation, because they know they can get away with it.  There are a lot more confrontations between police and nonwhites, in part because nonwhites know they can get away with confronting police when whites cannot.
When non whites walk down the street, they take up more space on the pavement than whites, expecting whites to get out of the way.

Knowing bad things about the Clintons appears to be quite dangerous for one's health:
Obviously, if these deaths, or many of them, are caused by the Clintons, they could only get away with it if the FBI and the Justice Department were in their pocket.
And events in the first year of the Trump presidency demonstrate that the FBI and the Justice Department were indeed in the Clinton's pocket.

There are a whole lot of odd and suspicious deaths of people that the Clintons had reason to get rid of, Epstein's death being the most suspicious one yet.
Epstein is dead, because people inconvenient to the Clintons tend to wind up dead.

The FBI is vast, and you don't need to be competent in committing crimes if you have the FBI and the Justice Department in your pocket.  Notice that the FBI is investigating Epstein in a manner that reveals it does not want to discover anything about his death.
The striking difference between the way Barr is investigating, and the way the FBI is investigating, suggests FBI involvement in Epstein's suicide. The Justice Department was obviously in the Clintons' pocket until Barr was appointed, hence competent murder was not a requirement.

Obviously Epstein had a little bit of help in his suicide.  From the screaming and the neck injuries, quite a lot of help.
And obviously whoever gave him that help had a lot of power, since they got the prison system to cooperate.
So, of the many many people who wanted him dead, the people in the best position to do it were the Clintons, who as we have seen in Inspector General Report, still have a lot of pull with the FBI.
So, most likely suspect, FBI acting on behalf of the Clintons.

The refusal to commit thought crimes is the tell tale giveaway of a shill - it shows he is working on a computer owned by his employer, and that HR can see what he writes.
Trooferism is an FBI operation to distract attention from the fact that they ignored the terrorists, being under orders from Mueller to ignore Muslim terrorism even when it got in their faces, and find white male Christian terrorism irrespective of whether it existed or not.
You blame the military, because the left hates the military, but you will not blame the FBI, which is the organization that regularly creates fake crimes, and which behaved very suspiciously in ignoring the terrorists.
And proof that Troofersim is an FBI shill operation is that Troofers will not criticize Mueller, or suggest his involvement, will not crticize the FBI, despite it being up to its neck in every real deep state conspiracy and they will not commit thought crimes.

If you had even started to think about what would be necessary to make a pencil, you would have sketched in an outline of how you would go about it.   How for example, would you form graphite into pencil leads?  How do you form anything?  With your bare hands?  What tools would you need?
Hint:  You cannot buy a machine for forming pencil leads, because that kind of machine is a one off - most machines for forming specific shapes are one offs.  You have to make the machine, just as Ivan the Troll had to make one off devices that formed high strength, high melting point steel into gun parts, for those parts of a gun where one cannot use anything more easily shapeable, those parts where one cannot use a threedee printer or a numerically controlled lathe.
And the fact that you have not sketched an outline tells me that you lack the knowledge to even think about what would be needed.
Machines exist for making arbitrary threedee shapes using additive or subtractive technologies, but there are rather severe limits to the materials they can shape, and the shapes they can achieve, so that in practice you wind up using several such devices to make the things that make the things that make the thing that you actually want to make. They cannot shape pencil lead or wood, or rather they can, but not to the shapes you need for a pencil.
So you would need to think about the kind of devices you would need for making a pencil, and then think about how to make those devices.

A business, like a family, has to be internally socialist, has to be externally market oriented.  But that a father has to run his family does not mean it is a good idea for the King, or the family court, to run everyone's family.

For a long time, no one could build a complete gun.  They always had to buy some of the parts, or else the gun would blow up.

When Wernher von Braun was merely sharing information and tutoring at NASA, the rockets did not work.  They had to put him in charge.
And when he retired, they still had all that information and the people he had tutored, but the rockets stopped getting better, started to get worse, and started to fail.
Shockley shared information and advised, he wrote the book, but transistors did not get built, except for a tiny number of not very reliable prototype transistors and those he personally and individually made.  When he formed a company of which he was the boss, *then* transistors were mass produced.
Rather more people can successfully operate a restaurant than can build rockets or transistors, but still, the vast majority of people cannot successfully operate a restaurant.  The vast majority of people who attempt to do so, fail.

There is an obvious problem with the non-aggression principle.  What do you do about large organized groups of people who aggress, and loudly proclaim the other guy is aggressing, and have crew of noisy public intellectuals (priests) explaining why the organized and dangerous group is in the right and doing good?  The other guy is supposedly price gouging, or emitting CO2, or hording, or engaging in usury (people who talk about usury are seldom aware of or interested in the way Christianity defined usury.  They just free money and to never have to pay it back.)
The union says that the employer is aggressing by locking unionized workers out and hiring non union labor, and bring up some cannon to make their point.
The Christian priest says that the priests of the Icelandic religion are aggressing, because they follow, and preach their followers to follow, the pagan rules on violence and law enforcement, which if successfully followed, are apt to result in Christians getting the short end of the stick, which was not a problem when everyone in Iceland followed the rules of the Icelandic gods, except for a few evildoers which evildoers tended to wind up dead.

We have plenty of existing societies that approximate anarchism.  In large parts of South East Asia the writ of the state runs mighty thin when you leave the cities.
All existing such societies are neither capitalist nor socialist.  It is dangerous for an outsider to wander about alone.  Rather they practice self sufficiency and gift economy.  Large scale economic activity is impractical.  As a result, they are mighty poor, which poverty is alleviated by remittances from young men and women sent away to work in more orderly places.
Capitalistic anarchic societies have existed, most famously Saga Period Iceland.  But though the state in Saga Period Iceland was barely existent, and did not possess a monopoly of legitimate force, Saga Period Iceland had a state religion - which state religion endorsed the right of individuals to themselves punish wrongs done to themselves and others, hence the weakness of the state.
It seems that you cannot get people to agree on what is lawful or unlawful without some sort of rather coercive imposition.  Some group of people is always going to concoct a real or imaginary grievance and demand compensation for real or imaginary sins. Saga period Iceland could have a market economy because they had substantial agreement on what constituted taking, and what to do about people who took stuff, substantial agreement on what was lawful or unlawful, this agreement being mediated by the Godar.  "Godar" is sometimes interpreted as chieftain, and they had a lot of power, but it means not chieftain, but God botherer, someone who prays, preaches to the congregation, and conducts religious rites.
What tends to happen in a state of anarchy is that people form tribalistic groups on the basis of race, religion and ethnicity, and then impose law that favors their group against outsiders.  Which leads to the development of the state, and when that somehow does not happen all that much, or the ensuing government is only strong in major population centers, life is insecure, and property considerably more insecure outside those centers.

The army is now ensuring that the letter and spirit of the constitution is being followed to hold new elections.
Which elections strike me as likely to result in more of the same, since too much is up for grabs for people to follow the rules, and too many people on all sides have broken the rules.  Also people are voting their tribe, faith and ethnicity, which apt to end in tribal war.
We are already seeing this stuff in USA, with the deep state illegally tapping Trump's phone and fabricating evidence against him, and the governor of a Democratic party state sending thugs to break up a Trump rally, and police to protect those thugs against rally security (fed cops and rentacops), which tactics are bringing us closer in the US to political outcomes being resolved by security forces.  We got rather close to a fight between rally security and anti rally security.  As the 2020 election draws closer, and if Trump starts draining the swamp, we are likely to see such battles.
This is likely to result in a contested election, with the outcome being resolved by whether Trump manages to arrest the Democratic candidate for quid pro quo (Plenty of Biden quid pro quo, notably him pulling the Ukraine prosecutor off investigating his son, and him collecting billions while negotiating a mysteriously terrible trade deal with China) or Trump gets arrested for quid pro quo.
Democrats committed no end of arguably illegal acts when they thought that they would be in power forever, and if Trump drains the swamp, which he has ample legal grounds to do, he is likely to get through a constitutional amendment allowing him to exceed term limits, which amendment the Democrats will protest was not legally passed, and we will find ourselves in the same Bolivian situation - too much up for grabs for people to accept election outcomes, and security forces playing an ever increasing role in elections.

Fifty four qbits is a a not quite seven qbyte computer.
Interesting applications become possible when you have two hundred and fifty six qbytes.
But fifty four qbits is one hell of a lot bigger than past quantum computers.  It is definitely a big step in the direction of a two hundred and fifty six qubyte computer.  The interesting question is how does this technology scale to reasonably sized quantum computers.
And the answer is, it does not.
To get a reasonable sized quantum computer you are going to need quantum error correction, with gigabyes of imperfect qbits representing a much smaller number of quantum error corrected qbits.  It is difficult wrap one's mind around the necessary design, which resists human intuition - hard to think about the scaling factors that come into play

We cannot support a world population of billions without large amounts of energy.  Green energy projects invariably mean less energy, which invariably shuts down people's lifestyles.  People want to continue traveling around, hence the riots in Chile.
If warmists believed a word of their own bullshit, the money received for carbon offset credits would be spent on actually offsetting carbon emissions, for example by pulverizing olivine rocks and dumping them in the shallow ocean, stimulating the natural process where by calcium silicates get converted into silica and calcium carbonate.
Instead carbon credits money is spent on jetsetting around the world to pontificate on global warming.
If warmists believed a word of their own bullshit, green energy projects would produce useful energy, instead of superior holiness.
What green energy projects produce is shakedowns of the power grid.  You get higher energy prices, and frequently get blackouts and brownouts.
We could in fact produce the required energy without carbon emissions either using nuclear power, or by mining olivine to offset the carbon emitted by burning coal or oil, but the warmists have shown zero interest in actually producing energy without emitting net carbon.
That green energy projects never actually work shows that warmists do not in fact believe what they purport to believe.
Some of them want to murder billions of people, some of them want to seize the means of production, and most of them want to shake down the energy grid.
Revealed preference is that actually reducing CO2 emissions is mighty low on their list of priorities - or at least reducing CO2 emissions in ways that do not destroy industrial civilization and result in the deaths of billions of people is mighty low on their list of priorities.

You are talking of stuff you are incapable of understanding.  The two dimensional surface of a balloon has no edge, and the big bang has no edge.
It was not that everything was getting further away from some central point.  It was that everything was getting further away from everything.
At the hypothetical start of the big bang, everything was in one place, near enough, and there was no other place.  The very concept of dimensionality was ill defined since everything was close to everything else, there was no elsewhere.  You cannot even define the number of dimensions until some places are further away from other places.  There was no space as we understand space in ordinary daily life, and if there was time, not as we understand time.
The explosion was the three dimensions of space and the dimension of time coming into being, distance becoming large enough to be meaningful, so that it became possible for space and time to even have dimensionality, and then rapidly becoming enormous, so enormous that stuff that was once in the same place as us, there being no other place, indeed no places at all, is now so distant as to be outside our light cone, and likely to remain forever outside our light cone.

To the extent that they were giving Donald Trump Junior a hard time on Woman question and the gay problem, they were doing a good job.
Trouble is, that when they were giving him a hard time on the Israeli question, they were taking the progressive line - Nationalist Jews oppressing the poor victim Mohammedans.  Supposedly Israel is Rhodesia and South Africa.  Which line is likely to result in Jews getting the same results as whites in Rhodesia and South Africa, ethnic cleansing and genocide.
The obvious, natural, and just solution to the Jewish problem is that nationalist Jews should move to Israel, which they are naturally inclined to do and are doing, and progressive Jews should assimilate, which they are doing whether they are inclined to do it or not - progressive Jews have rather few grandchildren, and their few grandchildren are seldom Jewish.
Hence the joke that the difference between Donald Trump and his enemies is that he has Jewish grandchildren, and they don't.
Recall all the progressive Jewish outrage at moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem.  They don't like either solution to the Jewish problem, but they particularly dislike the Nntionalist solution.  They want all those nationalist Jews back here.
If you are genuine nationalist, you would give Donald Trump Junior a hard time on the Jewish problem, not the Israeli question.

The best thing you can do to hide metadata data over the network is to make sure that video data is sent in a format that is indistinguishable to the eavesdropper on any single link from data being sent in a manner that hides who is talking to whom.
If you are implementing a mesh network, you have to know where in the mesh you are sending data to.
In the simple and direct way of implementing a mesh network, done with efficiency rather than secrecy in mind, every signal gets sent from nearest node to nearest node, which means the sender has to know the geographic location of the recipient in the mesh and a map of intermediaries, which which means the location of the parties is widely known, that everyone knows the location of an entity, but watching the network does not provide much metadata on which party is talking to which party.  You get close to onion routing for almost free.  And you can further hide the traffic by choosing a zig zag path and the sender onion encrypting to each relay, full onion routing, and by having random delays on the link - which means that full onion routing should a field for time sensitivity, that you need to have an interface to the network which supports leisurely interaction, an email like interface. If the network provides fast efficient traffic, the noisy bursts from people using the network to send data in the most direct and fastest way to the destination hide who is talking to whom using leisurely data slowly going an indirect route.

I have confidence in Trump, and waited to see.  Lots of people have underestimated Trump, and it has seldom worked out well for them.
He responded to Iran's response as I expected and hoped.
And Iran's response (symbolic escalation covering actual de-escalation, revealing that the killing of Solemieni was successful in deterring them from the war effort that they have been escalating ever since Obama's nuke deal) was what I had hoped it would be and doubtless what Trump expected it to be.
It takes two to make peace, only one to make war.  Iranians are not chanting "America should get off the bloodstained sands so that we can make them even bloodier".  They are chanting "Death to America". Similarly, read the comment section of internet articles that appeared about Khamenei's response to Trump's threat, shortly before Trump nailed Lots of Iranians in the comment sections promising to kill us, confidently telling us we are weak and will be destroyed.
The comment sections have fallen silent about our weakness and their prospects for destroying us.
The timeline of events was Twitter diplomacy:
Trump on New Year's day:
 > Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat.
To which Khamenei responded on Twitter:
 > You canât do anything.
Comment sections fill with Shiites gloating "Death to America", telling us America is weak, that they will destroy us.
Whereupon Trump kills Khamenei's buddy and top general.
Comment sections fill with rage, but optimism that we are weak and that they will destroy us evaporates.
That is a mighty good outcome.  We have no alternative but to make those that hate us, fear us.  Where the comment sections were full of gloating at our weakness, now fear at our strength.
Obama's nuke deal was seen as weakness, and escalated their messianic expectation that they would conquer us, however absurd that expectation seems to some of us.

At 5:26, Floyd tells the police officers that he is âclaustrophobicâ â
this, to say that he does not want to get into the police SUV. Remember
that the supposedly claustrophobic Floyd had been pulled out from behind
the wheel of his own car. This claustrophobic man is not so afraid of
confined spaces that he canât stand being in a car. A reasonable person,
by this point, might conclude that the clearly agitated Floyd is just
talking trash to keep the cops from arresting him. He has been talking
almost non-stop since the police first approached him, trying to
convince the police to let him go.
At 5:38, Floyd denies for a second time that he is on drugs.
Whatâs striking too at this point is how polite and non-confrontational
the police have been. They ask him repeatedly to get into the SUV.
âIâm gonna go in!â says Floyd, at 6:18.
âNo, youâre not!â one of the cops replies â meaning in context, youâre
saying youâre going to do this thing, but you are in fact refusing to do it.
They order him four or five more times to get into the SUV. He keeps
refusing. He claims that he is afraid, that heâs claustrophobic, that he
wonât be able to breathe. Voices of bystanders tell him to do what the
cops tell him to do, to quit trying to âwin.â Floyd says heâs ânot
trying to win.â
And then several more times, they order him to get in the car. One
officer goes around to the other side, to try to pull Floyd in. Floyd
offers to get into the front seat. No, an officer says. Floyd keeps
resisting. At 7:48, heâs still resisting and shrieking, and the
frustrated voice of an officer says, âTake a seat!â
Around 8:12, they finally put Floyd on the ground. He is continuing to
protest, âI canât breathe!â
Thatâs the end of the above video. We know what happened next
Because Floyd was lying about not being on drugs, and lying about being
claustrophobic, cops did not believe he could not breath.  Probably he
was lying about being unable to breath, because he could still speak.
Because he was unreasonably persistent in resisting, they put pressure
on his neck for considerably longer than is safe to do so, and because
he had coronary disease, that hold was even less safe than it usually
is. (And it is not very safe if you continue longer than twenty seconds
or so, which is all that is normally necessary.)

persecution of dindu nuffins to the mainstream media?  You will be a

Coakley was.  You will be world famous for years.
Every person in the world has seen the George Floyd video until they are
sick of it.
George Floyd was wrongfully killed, after engaging in violent acts
against black and white people, police among them, again and again again
and again all his life, among them two armed robberies, one of a
pregnant woman in her home, and getting a slap on the wrist for each of
his crimes.
If one keeps getting in fights with authority figures, eventually one of
them may well wrongfully kill one, but all the other times, they
wrongfully let him go on his merry way.
George Floyd wrongfully started a fight with police, while out of his
mind on drugs.  Police wrongfully ended it - but it happened to him, and
not to a white man, because George Floyd was out of his mind on a
cocktail of drugs that might well have killed him if the police did not,
and which certainly contributed to his death.
Meanwhile, at the George Floyd protests, many people have been
wrongfully killed, many innocent people have had their homes and
businesses burned down, many good men, many of them white, have suffered
grave injuries.
The number of black unarmed non felons killed by police is absolutely
insignificant.  The number of white unarmed non felons killed by police
is enormously larger, because black privilege means that cops cannot get
away with doing that to blacks, and can get away with doing that to
whites.  There is clear and overwhelming discrimination by cops and
judges against white people.
If a white man had George Floyd's record, he would not have been killed
by police because he would still be in jail.
And if, when he eventually, at long, long, long last, got out of jail,
he was killed the way George Floyd was killed, no one would notice and
no one would care.

Civilized people who live among other civilized people don't need police
and policing, and for them police are a dangerous nuisance who give you
traffic tickets and whom the family court will send to kick down your

segregation and Jim Crow artificially created.

The Topic was Karl's deluded belief that whites were physically
attacking blacks in America with impunity today, while the reality is
that this simply never happens, hence the desperate and ever
unsuccessful efforts of the mainstream media to find a poster boy, while
in fact there are continual group attacks by blacks on whites with
impunity, which attacks are indulged and tolerated by authority.
There were white slaves in America before there were black slaves in
America.  The Muslim world had been raiding white countries for slaves
for a long time.
The Barbary wars were fought over Muslims enslaving white Americans.
American slaves were not enslaved by Americans but purchased from black
people who had enslaved other black people, for the most part enslaved
them for cause (petty crime or rebellion) and according to law
applicable at the time, and the descendants of those black people are
still selling slaves to Muslims today, as for example in Libya.
Those slaves sold by their black owners to Americans were vastly better
off in America than they would have been in Africa, and their
descendants are vastly better off in America than in Africa.
Their descendants in America live largely on crime and welfare, and are
dependent on the wealth produced by whites, as was illustrated when they

Slaves in Africa were generally people seized by the local authorities
for vagrancy and petty theft (the penalty for everything else being
death)  Some of them were populations engaged in stubborn but
unsuccessful rebellion.  If they had not been sold off, would probably
have been eaten.
They were vastly better off in America then, and their descendants are
vastly better off than the descendants of those that remained behind.
Segregation was good for whites and good for blacks.  Look at the school
cafeteria.  Blacks don't want to hang out with whites, and whites don't
want to hang out with blacks.
Diversity plus proximity equals war.
Segregation created a black middle class, that had real jobs and real
families, because it needed black shops, black cops, black judges, and
black lawyers.  Before desegregation, black men had wives, and black
universities turned out blacks with skills in something other than
hating white.
Desegregation has destroyed city after city, starting with Detroit, and
it has destroyed black people, who are now fatherless and now live on
crime and welfare.
Whites fled Detroit because black people were beating up white people
and burning down their homes.  Without white people to keep everything
running, Detroit collapsed.
When blacks were no longer sent to the back of the bus, white people
stopped using buses because they got beaten up.
Blacks commit more crime, and the most severe inequalities in
incarceration are in Democratic states with an indulgent attitude
towards crime, especially black crime.
The question is not what proportion of a race get imprisoned, but what
proportion of criminals of a race get imprisoned, and it is absolutely
obvious that blacks are more likely to get away with crimes, or not be
punished even if caught, than whites.
It is absolutely obvious that blacks can get away with crimes more than
white people, due to less enforcement, a revolving door policy by
judges, and a remarkably indulgent attitude to attacks by colored people
on whites.
And strange to report, the more indulgent the State Government towards
crime, especially black crime, the more unequal the incarceration rate.
 If racism caused inequality in incarceration rates, why are the
inequalities distributed the way they are. By and large, the more
progressive the state government the worse the disparity.
Try to imprison less people, you are apt to wind up with a larger
proportion of blacks in prison relative to whites in prison.
What happens is that if you simply imprison less and police less, this
decreases white imprisonment considerably but does not much decrease
black imprisonment because it increases crime, and increases black crime
more than white crime. Imprisoning lots of people reduces crime, but it
reduces black crime considerably more, reducing the disparity in
imprisonment rates.  Black crime seems to be more sensitive to policing
and enforcement than white crime, perhaps because blacks get less
policing and enforcement than whites, so increasing enforcement on
whites yields decreasing returns.
If you make an effort to rehabilitate prisoners, and get them out of
jail without them promptly needing to be returned, this tends to have
more success with white prisoners, and again your disparity increases.

permanently out of circulation as a danger to himself and others.

Reality is that all government technology is stolen or purchased from
the private sector, and that when the government steals technology from
the private sector, it has to kidnap the people who created it, and when
those people retire, the technology gradually goes to shit.
The historical fact is that the VFR, not the German government, created
liquid fuel rockets, and a man kidnapped from the VFR created the moon
rocket.  And when that man retired from NASA, rockets started going
downhill until Musk created a private rocket with private money from his
own wealth, and the wealth of similar people.
Russian nukes were stolen American technology, which were based on
stolen private technology and people kidnapped from the private sector,
as NASA's big liquid fueled rockets were based on the VFR's tiny liquid
fueled rockets and a man kidnapped from the VFR.
And since those men have, like Von Braun, retired, nukes have been going
downhill.  America can no longer make lithium six, tritium, or plutonium
238, which makes it unlikely that our nukes still work.
The people in charge of our nukes want a lead time before testing a
nuke, which lead time just happens to be long enough that they are
likely to get a different, and perhaps more malleable, president before
the inconvenience of actually testing a nuke.

If socialism could do science and technology, then the Soviet Union and

Wherever you see a military with decent technology, it is because they

If socialism could produce high tech â¦
The difference is so obvious and enormous that you can see it from
space: The difference is simple and glaringly obvious. Government cannot
produce science and technology, except by buying it or confiscating it
from private actors.
When the US captured Wernher von Braun it tried to build rockets and
failed. It asked him how his rockets were built, it looked at his
rockets, and it still failed. When it put him in charge, then it
succeeded. And when he died, rocketry stopped advancing until Space X.
Government funded him to build bigger rockets, probably bigger than the
private sector would have or could have. But it funded him because he
was already building rockets, as Hewlett Packard had already been
building electronic equipment, which work was disrupted, not sponsored,
by the wartime electronic counter measures work.
German rocketry started with the Verein fÃ¼r Raumschiffahrt (Society for
space travel). German rockets were based on VFR work, and American and
Russian rockets based on German work. And the Nazis shut down VFR, as
the American Government shut down Hewlett Packard.
Silicon Valley was not born of the Harvard Groupâs Electronic Counter
measures. If it had been, Silicon Valley would be located in Harvard,
where almost every member of the Electronic Counter Measures group was
and remained. Rather, the Harvard groupâs electronic counter measures
were born of seizing what was in Hewlett Packardâs garage, much as the
V2 and the space program was born of seizing what was in the garages of
VFR members.
That Silicon Valley happened where the government stole technology from,
(Hewlett Packardâs garage in Palo Alto) not where they stole technology
to (Harvard) shows that government did not cause Silicon Valley.
Similarly, NASA could not build rockets, except they put a man the Nazis
kidnapped from the VFR, and that they kidnapped from the Nazis, in charge.
Observe the Soviet Union.  Before the revolution, Russians were among
the world leaders in creating planes and such.
After the revolution, Lenin had to hire American experts, and all Soviet
cars were inferior knockoffs of American cars.
They did OK in building guns and suchlike, but that was Russian
socialism competing with American socialism.
And when American socialism attempt to create technology, what does it do.

It turns out that without a single authoritative trusted central point

or set up his own peer, perhaps with peer and client running on the same
computer.  If the government raids a big peer in a big computer center,
it does not get any interesting secret keys, because the master key for
that peer is probably written down on the margin of a bible on a
bookshelf of someone on the other side of the world.
This is equivalent to the corporate form:  The peer computers are like
the board, the client computers are like the shareholders. And a human
whose the client program has the master key to a peer whose clients hold
a lot of stake is equivalent to a human member of a human board of a

Monero's blockchain necessarily leaks quite a bit of information.
Perhaps the information is completely useless to an attacker.
It is certainly useless to an attacker who attempts to to figure
out who is transacting with whom by performing the attacks
specifically defined and addressed.  Monaro is clearly invulnerable
to the bitcoin problem.
Whether the attacker can put the bits and pieces together and
frequently make a good guess as to what is happening behind the
curtain is unclear to me, and I doubt it is much clearer to
the developers of Monero.
I don't see a survey and and analysis looking for the gaps between

perform such an analysis.
If _I_ was a Monero contributor and developer, I would have such
a survey and analysis at my fingertips.  What _can_ an attacker do
by analyzing the blockchain, and what patterns in the blockchain
would he notice?  In what ways do your activities when you use
Monero cause the blockchain to differ from white noise to someone
without your private keys?
It is really hard to do new stuff securely while using a group of

The problem is vastly less worse than Bitcoin.  Monaro is better
in this regard than Bitcoin.  Whether it is enough better to make
a big important difference is disturbingly unclear.
I have not attempted to scrutinize Zcash, which uses cryptography well
beyond my limited competence.
But I am sufficiently competent to understand Wasabi, which is what I am
indeed promoting.
If zcash works as described, the blockchain should look like white
noise to an attacker without the private keys.
Whether it _does_ look like white noise is beyond my abilities
to determine.
This is the sudoko attack.
When Wasabi was issued, it was vulnerable to the sudoko attack,
which could typically track about half the coins through a
transaction, but _now_ countermeasures have been applied against
that attack.
The sudoko attack should have been foreseen, and it was not.  But
_now_ there is an effort to check the mighty fortress walls to make
sure there are no gaps between the mighty fortress walls that an
attacker who declines to play by your security model can use.
Yes, this is an important vulnerability of Wasabi transactions.  They
can detect that you have laundered money, though once the money has been
laundered, they can track it no further. But Monaro _itself_ stands out,
while Wasabi transactions are just more bitcoin transactions.
If everyone used Monaro, Monaro would not stand out, and if everyone
used Wasabi, Wasabi transactions would not stand out.
To use crypto currency, you are apt to wind up laundering bitcoin by
converting it to Monaro, which transaction tends to be highly traceable,
and then converting it back to Bitcoin, which transaction tends to be
highly traceable, and then actually paying someone with bitcoin, whereas
if you are using wasabi, you are paying with the equivalent of crumpled

I did not find a way to break it, but it failed to inspire me

There are lots of cryptographers vastly better than I am, but they
tend to suffer from the mighty unbreakable fortress wall syndrome.
They build crypto that is utterly unbreakable against the threat

declared to be out of scope.
And there are lots of cryptographers, me being one of them, who
are aware of the fact that you need walls on all sides, but are
apt to screw up the crypto.  Monero struck me as being of even
less than my own regrettable level of cryptographic competence,
(I would not have fucked up over non prime order elliptic points)
and somewhat less than my level of awareness of the need for walls
to properly link up with each other.
The problem with Monaro, is that though it avoids the direct linking
of transactions that bitcoin suffers from, it leaks a whole lot of
data about networks of people transacting with each other, and I
suspect that some of the time, the data that it does leak is
sufficient to make a pretty good guess of what is going on behind
the mighty fortress walls of cryptography, that sometimes it
is bulletproof, and sometimes the bullets get through.
I don't think anyone has broken it - I certainly could not -
but I expect that the adversaries are making efficient use of
what it does leak - that they can find interesting information in
what is out of scope of its security model.
I favor Wasabi wallet, which mingles your bitcoins with those of a
large number of other people.
The Lightning network solves the problem that bitcoin has of
transaction linkability, but you then have the correspondence
banking problem, that too many "trusted" intermediaries know
who is transacting with whom.
There is a flaw in the human user interface of the Lightning

Race is based on ancestry - different groups have different evolutionary

Some of the descendants of the common ancestor of chimp and man remained

consequence subject to less evolutionary pressure to make them into a
creature very different from a chimp.
Some of the descendants of the common ancestor of chimp and man headed
north, a long way north, and eventually inland, and adapted to extremely
cold winters and large changes in seasonal availability of food, not by

The easy money policies of Greenspan had nothing to do with it.
The problem was criminal misconduct.  Vast numbers of dud mortgages were

The basic problem was that the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating

without going to jail, and the financial crisis was them committing even
more criminal misconduct and not going to jail for it.
Which made the criminal misconduct by Angelo Mozilo possible.

no houses were purchased by white people, and almost all purchases

This is true, and is the argument for anarcho capitalism.
If people are left alone to live their lives, they need to have stuff to
live it with, property.  Other people will covet their stuff, and their
entire lifestyle, if it is a peaceful, cooperative and happy lifestyle,
which covetousness fueled rage has been spectacularly on display in
antifa and BLM attacks on the suburbs.
They will demand inclusion, and if included will destroy the productive
high trust, cooperative, community, so need to be excluded.  Observe the
catastrophic impact of codes of conduct on the open source community.
So people gang up to predate on other communities, and other communities
have to gang up to protect themselves.
And thus you get states and state religions, the largest scale ganging
up, and the most extreme for of violence by the gang.  If you don't have
a state and state religion, you get conquered.  When a hostile elite
fails to protect the community that created it, you get state failure,
as is happening in the US.
And the only way out is a loyalist elite, and loyalist state religion.
Trump and the Trumpists love America and the greatness of our ancestors,
and the Christianity that Trump trumpets, but probably does not take too

of our ancestors.
The deep state elite hates America and Americans, as was apparent in the
Paris Treaty and the Trade Pacific Partnership.
It is also apparent in their art of the deep state elite and the Harvard
If you twit a member of the elite over the shittiness of a Mondrian or a
Picasso, he may well condescend that he is a sophisticated art
appreciator and you are  not.  Maybe he is, though I doubt it.  Twit him
over the dog poop statue in the bay area, the reply is likely to amount
to "Racist".
That statue is just our elite giving us the finger, same as tearing down
the statue of Lincoln and vandalizing Churches.
You reckon that when they smash their way into a Church and behead the
statue of the mother of Christ, it is a signal of sophistication?
Nah, it is a signal they have power, we don't, and they hate us.  Same
thing the dog poop statue signals.  They want to erase all signs of our
past greatness.
Compare and contrast with Putin's great Cathedral, which celebrates the
past greatness of Russia and Western Civilization.
If you try to get an member of the elite to give you the supposed
rationale for the dog poop statue, he will garble it incoherently, if he
responds at all, thereby not even trying to display sophistication.  The
reply, if you get a reply at all, is going to be "racist" - If you
object to our erasure, you are racist.  That is what it is all about,
and the reply is likely to be related to what it is in fact about.
When people make a show of appreciating Mondrians, they are usually
indeed signaling sophistication, as well as signalling their progressive
credentials, that they support the erasure of our history and
civilization.  If they appreciate the dog poop statue, they are
performing a victory dance over their defeated enemies, and if you twit
them on it, they are unlikely to even try to signal sophistication.  It
is analogous to what we saw with debate on George Zimmerman - the people
arguing that George Zimmerman assaulted Trayvon Martin were not making
arguments that supported their supposed story, they were making
arguments that Trayvon Martin was entitled to attack George Zimmerman,
that black people have aristocratic privilege to use violence on peons
when treated with less respect than they are rightly entitled to by
virtue of their superior status, that a white person is guilty of
assault should he attempt to defend himself.

Should we make pornography illegal?
[A] No, because male desire for sexual gratification is not causing
society any problems. Now, we should ban gay, tranny, and cuck porn. And
we should ban romance novels, i.e. porn for women. But heterosexual
porn, especially if it depicts violent rape, will be allowed, and
documentation of little prepubescent girls fucking their dogs will be
required material for anyone who wants to be a member of the priesthood,
not because it is nice to watch, but because it is incredibly red pilling.
[B] No, because pornography allows us to learn about various fetishes
and alternative sexual practices, and that is valuable knowledge.
[C] Yes, because pornography is how the (((Synagogue of Satan)))
destroyed our TFR. Before the advent of pornography, there were fecund
marriages and stable families, but then we let in these Semitic
parasites, and they singlehandedly turned all our women to porn sluts
and all our men to incels. Were it not for Jewish pornographers, we
would all have big families, just like we had in Hitlerâs Germany.
Similarly to Brave New World, the Jews are using our own desires to
control us â so itâs more like a Brave JEW World, am I right?
[D] No, but Child Porn should still be illegal, because whenever you
look at an image of a child being abused, you are both encouraging the
production of more CP, and repeating the original abuse.
[E] No, but we should require all porn actors to wear condoms, in order
to protect the actors and actresses from venereal diseases, and to teach
the viewers â who are often our own sons â to use contraceptives. Porn
is spiritual poison, but itâs not realistic to ban all of it, so we
should focus instead on protecting the sex workers â who are often our

What should happen if it goes down is that few people notice, they just

female sexuality is causing problems.
Your reply was totally fine, absolutely nothing wrong with it - if
people's concerns about sexual activity are totally gender neutral,
which of course they are not.  You imposed a gender neutral frame on a
strongly gendered question, reinterpreting it as gender neutral.

acknowledge that women and sodomites are causing problems, but unable to
acknowledge that anyone else thinks that they are causing problems.

 It rapidly became apparent that the NSA was more interested in spying

revoked that order, but, what Snowden revealed, is that the NSA

The libertarian justification for controls on recreational drug use is
that drug abuse, vice, causes harmful externalities for third parties.
But in fact, we observe most of the harmful externalities of speed and
crack in black communities, and most of the harmful externalities of
alcohol in native American communities.
As a result there are no end of ingenious workarounds to provide
selective restriction on the availability of alcohol in native American
communities while maintaining lip service to equality before the law,
and no end of ingenious workarounds to provide selective restriction on
the availability of crack in black communities, to which ingenious
workarounds progressives turn a blind eye.
From time to time, good progressives from Harvard notice what is going

We do not in fact have equality before the law, because actual equality

I would love to debate rape and sexual harassment with you.
We, meaning we white straight Christian males, would love to suppress
rape and sexual harassment, but women are not cooperating.
The only way to suppress it is to go back to eighteenth century, or
better, the very similar Old Testament, law and custom on sex and
family, in which the victim and complainant is the man who has rightful
authority over the woman's sexual and reproductive services, and her
consent is only relevant to her guilt, not to the guilt of the man who
had sex with her, or took her behind closed doors.
Today's rural Hindu India still has the good stuff, as do some parts of
Dar Al Islam.  Works fine for them.  Ours is not working for us.
And were the men guarding it, and the man who did it, busted?
How do you know it was real?
If it was real, they got away with it.  If punished, unreal, or at least
unreal in the sense that white Christian straight males conceive of rape.
Everyone can see what is happening with sexual harassment charges.  I
can see, in a statistically insignificant number of cases, what is
happening with rape charges, and data such as the University of Virginia
gives me statistically significant confirmation.

This is the inverse of the poster girl rule.
The poster girl rule is that the if the poster girl or poster boy for X

The inverse of the poster girl rule is that if stuff that should make
the news strangely cannot make the news, as for example the
multitudinous examples of voter fraud that poll watchers and president
Trump are complaining about, that stuff is real.
Recapping on my favorite fake poster girl story:
Obama administration told University campuses that there was a rape
crisis on campus - which in a sense is true, but not at all true in the
sense that the Obama administration intended.  From the point of view of
women, the problem is that white high status big men on campus are not
raping them.  Women really don't like consent culture. In their bones,
they feel that consent is failing a shit test.  But they cannot express
this, even to themselves, so they express it in words that are socially
approved, but the real meaning of the words is inverted.
Obama administration, finding it strangely impossible to punish these
supposed rapes through the courts, commanded university admin to punish
them administratively.
University of Virginia investigated thirty something rapes on campus.
No disciplinary action in any of these rapes.
Rolling Stone concludes that the University of Virginia must be closing
its eyes to horrible horrible horrible brutal rape.  Investigates.
