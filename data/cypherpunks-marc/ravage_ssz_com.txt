PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 558  September 26, 2001   by Phillip F. Schewe, Ben Stein,
and James Riordon
ENTANGLEMENT OF MACROSCOPIC OBJECTS, a pair of
gas clouds containing a trillion atoms each, has been achieved by a
research team in Denmark  (Eugene Polzik, University of Aarhus,
011-45-89423745, polzik constituting by far the
largest material objects entangled on demand and paving the way
for quantum teleportation between macroscopic objects. The
accomplishment, published in this week's issue of Nature
(Julsgaard et al., 27 September 2001), was announced in
preliminary form this June at the first International Conference on
Quantum Information, sponsored in part by the Optical Society of
America and the American Physical Society.  One of the most
profound features of quantum mechanics, entanglement is a special
interrelationship between objects in which measuring one object
instantly influences the other, even if the two are completely
isolated from one another.   No previous entanglement with atoms
has involved more than four particles. Furthermore, atoms have
only been entangled at close proximity, either as ions spaced
microns apart in a tiny trap (Update 475), or atoms flying over a
short range through narrowly spaced cavities (Hagley et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett., 7 July 1997).  In the present experiment, researchers
sent a light beam through two cesium gas samples, each held in a
special paraffin-coated cell.  The beam changed each sample's
"collective spin," which describes, in a sense, the net direction in
which all of the atoms' tiny magnets add up.  First, the researchers
measured the sum of the two collective spins without knowing the
individual collective spin of each sample.  A subsequent
measurement, nearly a millisecond later, showed that the sum
remained the same.  This demonstrated that the two gas samples
maintained their special interrelationship and were entangled. Although the two samples were just millimeters apart, they could
in principle be separated, and thereby entangled, at much longer
distances.  Entanglement of such large objects enables "bulk"
properties, like collective spin, to be "teleported," or transferred,
from one gas cloud to another.  THE BLACK HOLE OF GENEVA.  Black holes are known as the

In the Next Chapter, Is Technology an Ally?
By KATIE HAFNER
OVER the last two weeks, computer scientists and others who think about
technology have wondered aloud about its likely role in countering
terrorism -- or in carrying it out. Have the limitations and dangers of
technology been overlooked? Where, on the other hand, might technological
innovation emerge or be redirected as a result of recent events?
For Ray Kurzweil, an expert in artificial intelligence and an innovative
figure in computing, the events are already accelerating technologies that
allow work, and people, to be dispersed rather than centralized. Security
experts like Peter Neumann point to the renewed interest - and perhaps
unfounded confidence - in technologies to confirm identities and track
"Overendowing high-tech solutions is riskful," Dr. Neumann said, "in the
absence of adequate understanding of the limitations of the technology and
the frailties and perversities of human nature."
Mr. Kurzweil and Dr. Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI International, a
research group in Menlo Park, Calif., were among six technology experts
invited by Circuits to assess the challenges ahead. The other participants
were Bruce Sterling, a science fiction author who writes frequently about
technology; Lawrence Lessig, a professor at Stanford Law School who has
written extensively on law and the Internet; Severo Ornstein, a retired
hardware engineer and one of the computer scientists who worked on the
original Arpanet, the precursor to the Internet; and Whitfield Diffie, the
inventor of public key cryptography, a method of encoding electronic
Each has been in the public eye for a decade or more, thinking and writing
about the promise and peril of technology. Some are more sanguine than
others about a high-tech society.
Their discussion, conducted last weekend by e-mail, touched on technology's
possible uses in fostering security and on the issues that will arise along
the way. Here are excerpts from the conversation.
Q. What role will technological innovation play in responding to terrorism?
Lessig These attacks could spur a great deal of technological innovation.
The hard question is whether the innovation will be tailored to protect
privacy as well as support legitimate state interests in surveillance and
control. We as a culture think too crudely about technologies for
surveillance. The conflict is always framed as some grand either/or. But if
we kept pressure on the innovators and, in particular, the government, to
develop technologies that did both, we could preserve important aspects of
our freedom, while responding to the real threats presented by the attacks.
Kurzweil The Sept. 11 tragedy will accelerate a profound trend already well
under way from centralized technologies to distributed ones and from the
real world to the virtual world. Centralized technologies are subject to
disruption and disaster. They also tend to be inefficient, wasteful and
harmful to the environment. Distributed technologies, on the other hand,
tend to be flexible, efficient and relatively benign in their environment
In the immediate aftermath of this crisis, we already see a dramatic
movement away from meetings and conferences in the real world to those in
the virtual world, including Web- based meetings, Internet-based
videoconferencing and other examples of virtual communication.
Despite the recent collapse of market value in telecommunications,
bandwidth nonetheless continues to expand exponentially, which will
continue to improve the resolution and sense of realism in the virtual
world. We'll see a great deal of innovation to overcome many of the current
Diffie Revision of the air traffic control system together with that of
other industrial command and control phenomena will push reliability and
security in computing and computer communications. Such systems may provide
a testing ground for the command and control of ballistic missile defense
systems in which response times may be slower but the spectrum of phenomena
requiring analysis will be broader.
Attempts to control the use of cryptography and other security measures
will make the development of improved command and control networks more
difficult and may impede this task by limiting the people who can
contribute to approved government and contractor personnel.
Lessig This "scenario of terror" was not low tech, for its impact was not
just the impact of the souls who were lost. As powerful was the effect of a
world watching as it occurred. The technology of a networked world meant
that scores of television cameras would be trained on the south tower, to
capture the horror of the delayed second impact. And the extraordinary
impact of these killings in two cities is the product of a heavily
integrated - technologically integrated - world community. Terrorists take
advantage of this technology to have the effect they seek. Elsewhere, in
places without this technology, it would not have the same effect.
Diffie Larry, this is a great observation. I wonder if it will be possible
to discover whether the attackers had that subtlety of thought.
Q. Larry Lessig says that the hard question is whether innovation will be
tailored to protect privacy as well as support legitimate state interests
in surveillance and control. Do you agree that we as a culture tend to
think too crudely about technologies for surveillance? Where do you think
the trade-offs should be?
Neumann The most elaborate technological measures are likely to be
inadequate, misused and subverted. Surveillance is all too easily misused.
Trapdoors in cryptography to facilitate law enforcement can be misused.
Existing system security is seriously flawed. As a result, we must avoid
expecting technological security measures to be adequate in protecting
privacy. So, ultimately, we have a double-edged sword. Techniques to
protect can be used to subvert, attack or otherwise compromise human
rights, nation states and organizations. The problems are inherently human,
and technology can be used for good or bad.
Sterling The question is badly put. I don't worry much about Big Brother
states surveilling average citizens. It's just not cost-effective, and what
Mom says in Peoria just doesn't interest the serious power players in
spydom. I do worry plenty about sneaky political operatives carrying out
dirty-tricks campaigns against the private lives of prominent politicians.
The payoff there is huge. It can destabilize legitimate governments more
effectively than terrorism.
I don't think there's a good trade- off here. If we're going to use
surveillance as a weapon, then we should trust our democratic traditions
and arm the population with it.
Kurzweil The nature of these terrorist attacks and the organization behind
it puts civil liberties in general at odds with legitimate state interests
in surveillance and control. The entire basis of our law enforcement
system, and indeed much of our thinking about security, is based on an
assumption that people are motivated to preserve their own lives and
well-being. That is the logic behind all of our strategies from law
enforcement on the local level to mutual assured destruction on the world
stage. But a foe that values the destruction of both its enemy and itself
is not amenable to this line of attack.
Lessig This is a critically important insight. The real problem we face is
not slowness in technological innovation. The real problem is slowness in
legal and civil rights innovation in response to the technological change.
It was not until the late 1960's that the Supreme Court finally held that
wiretapping was regulated by the Fourth Amendment.
The reason for this failing has lots to do with the way lawyers think. We
are reactive traditionalists. It is hard to think creatively. But if we
used the same kind of innovative creativity that our Framers used in
crafting our government, we could craft creative balances between
technological capabilities and human weakness. Technologies can't be
guaranteed to be used only for the good. But technologies placed within
well-crafted institutional structures can be made more likely safe than not.
Diffie (Disclosure: I am in the protection business.)
In my view the natural trade-off is a broad public right to inquire (i.e.,
listen to the radio, point infrared sensors around, make video recordings,
analyze the data from the sensors with computers, etc.) and the right of
the individual to employ protection from surveillance (cryptography,
insulated walls, wearing a mask, using pseudonyms, etc.). This presumes a
commercial right to make and sell products that support the individual's
desire for privacy.
I read in the documents of the revolutionary era a recognition of a broad
right of the individual to act on self-perceived interest and generally not
to be required to cooperate with someone else's view of those interests.
This seems to me roughly what freedom means. The trends in contemporary
society that most bother me are not so much government use of wiretaps or
video cameras but such things as the requirement that cash transactions
over $10,000 be reported to the I.R.S., that I must show identification to
travel, etc.
Ornstein I think there is a genuine tension between the desire for security
and for privacy/individual freedom. This is just an instance of the more
general conflict between the needs and desires of the individual and those
of the larger society.
Today's technology permits small numbers of people to wreak a
disproportionate amount of havoc. (Without jet airplanes, the hijackers
couldn't have done much damage with their box cutters.) I suspect the
debate about where to draw the security line will probably be ongoing and
will depend on how much damage occurs in the future: The more damage, the
tighter we'll circle the wagons.

GEORGIA Public Announcement
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Office of the Spokesman
September 26, 2001
The U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi has received credible information that American
citizens in Georgia are being targeted for kidnapping.  U.S. citizens are
urged to maintain a high level of vigilance and to take appropriate steps to
enhance their security.  Americans should maintain a low profile, vary
routes and times for all required travel, and if at all possible, are
encouraged not to travel alone or to remote or sparsely inhabited sections
of the city.  U.S. Government personnel have been advised to take the same
precautions.  There is no information to suggest that this threat has any
connection to the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.
While previous kidnapping concerns have centered around the Pankisi Gorge
north of, and including, Akhmeta and the northern mountainous areas of
Georgia bordering Chechnya and Dagestan, the current threat focuses on the
Tbilisi region.  Furthermore, we can not discount the possibility of a
similar risk to Americans elsewhere in the country.  The Embassy's previous
warnings to avoid travel to the Pankisi Gorge, Ossetia and Abkhazia regions
of Georgia remain in effect.
The Embassy will provide additional information should it become available.
American citizens overseas may contact the American Citizens Services unit
of the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi by telephone or fax for up-to-date
information on security conditions. The U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi is located
at 25 Atoneli Street, Telephone: (995)(32) 98-99-67; fax (995)(32) 93-37-59.
For further general information regarding travel to Georgia and, in view of
recent events, Americans traveling and residing abroad should monitor
closely the Department's Internet web site at particularly the Department's Worldwide Caution, when considering travel

               Consular Information Sheet
November 17, 2000
COUNTRY DESCRIPTION:  A mountainous republic situated in the heart of the
Caucasus range, Georgia has borders with Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and
Russia.  Living conditions are improving, but do not meet Western standards.
Tourist facilities outside of Tbilisi, the capital, are not highly
developed, and many of the goods and services taken for granted in other
countries are not yet available.
ENTRY REQUIREMENTS:  A passport and visa are required.  U.S. citizens may
receive a visa upon arrival at Tbilisi Airport, the Port of Poti, and the
Red Bridge ("Tsiteli Khidi") crossing on Georgia's border with Azerbaijan.
Americans intending to enter Georgia at other points-of-entry must obtain a
visa beforehand at a Georgian embassy or consulate abroad.  Armenian and
Azerbaijani visas are no longer valid for transit through Georgia.
Travelers to Georgia must fill out a customs declaration upon arrival that
is to be presented to customs officials when departing the country.  Failure
to declare currency and items of value can result in fines or other
penalties.  For further information, contact the Embassy of Georgia at 1615
New Hampshire Avenue, N.W., Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 20009, tel. (202)
387-2390, fax (202) 393-4537; Internet: SAFETY AND SECURITY:  The U.S. Embassy advises American citizens to avoid
travel to the separatist-controlled region of Abkhazia.  There are reports
of continued fighting and terrorist activity in Abkhazia (and around
Zugdidi), including attacks and kidnappings of international observers.
These incidents have included bombings and the mining of roads which pose a
serious threat to vehicular traffic.  While Abkhaz "border officials" may
demand that travelers entering the region purchase "visas" from the
so-called "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Abkhazia," the U.S. Government
does not recognize the separatists' declaration of an Abkhazia independent
from Georgia.  As a result of the restricted access of U.S. officials to
Abkhazia, the ability of the U.S. Government to assist American citizens
there is extremely limited, even in emergencies.  American citizens in areas
of Western Georgia near the Abkhaz border are advised to be aware of their
surroundings at all times and to avoid straying off main roads and traveling
after dark.
American citizens are also advised to avoid travel to other areas of
continuing security concern: specifically, the Pankisi Gorge north of
Akhmeta and the northern mountainous areas of Georgia bordering Chechnya,
Dagestan and Svaneti.  There have been instances of kidnappings for ransom
purposes in these regions.
As a result of a threat posed by banditry and other criminal activities,
American citizens should carefully evaluate the implications for their
security before considering travel to South Ossetia and along the Georgian
Military Highway north of the Gudauri ski resort.
CRIME:  While petty thefts and pickpocketing were previously  the most
common crimes, recently foreigners in Georgia have also been victimized by
muggings, home break-ins and other violent crimes.  Most muggings have
occurred on side streets near Tbilisi's city center.  In all instances, the
mugging victims have first been knocked unconscious by blows to the head.
Petty theft is  particularly a problem on the Tbilisi metro system and in
mini-vans used for public transit.  While the security of overland travel in
Georgia has improved, vehicular and rail traffic remains vulnerable to
robbery.  Americans  visiting or residing in Tbilisi should take the same
precautions they would in any major city where crime can be a problem.
American citizens in Tbilisi are advised to remain aware of their
surroundings at all times, day or night; and to stay off dark or unlit
streets even when traveling in a group; to avoid carrying large sums of
cash; and to be particularly cautious of being singled out for victimization
at establishments frequented by foreigners.
The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported immediately
to the local police and the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.  U.S.
citizens may refer to the Department of State's pamphlet "A Safe Trip
Abroad" for ways to promote a more trouble-free journey. Additional
information on the region can be found in the brochure "Tips for Travelers
to Russia and the Newly Independent States."  Both publications are
available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing
Office, Washington, D.C. 20402, via the Internet at
 or via the Bureau of Consular Affairs
home page at MEDICAL FACILITIES:  Medical care in Georgia is limited.  There is a severe
shortage of basic medical supplies, including disposable needles,
anesthetics, and antibiotics.  Elderly travelers and those with pre-existing
health problems may be at risk due to inadequate medical facilities.
Georgian doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment before
rendering medical services.
MEDICAL INSURANCE:  U.S. medical insurance is not always valid outside the
United Sates.  U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs do not provide payment
for medical services outside the United States.  Doctors and hospitals often
expect immediate cash payment for health services.  Uninsured travelers who
require medical care overseas may face extreme difficulties.
Check with your own insurance company to confirm whether your policy applies
overseas, including provision for medical evacuation, and for adequacy of
coverage.  Serious medical problems requiring hospitalization and/or medical
evacuation to the United States can cost tens of thousands of dollars.
Ascertain whether payment will be made to the overseas hospital or doctor or
whether you will be reimbursed later for expenses you incur.  Some insurance
policies also include coverage for psychiatric treatment and for disposition
of remains in the event of death.
Useful information on medical emergencies abroad, including overseas
insurance programs, is provided in the department of state's bureau of
consular affairs brochure "Medical Information for Americans Traveling
Abroad," available via the bureau of consular affairs home page or autofax:
(202) 647-3000.
OTHER HEALTH INFORMATION:  Information on vaccinations and other health
precautions may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's hotline for international travelers at 1-877-FYI-TRIP
(1-877-394-8747); fax 1-888-CDC-FAXX (1-888-232-3299), or via the CDC's
Internet site at TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ROAD CONDITIONS:  While in a foreign country, U.S.
citizens may encounter road conditions which differ significantly from those
in the United States.  The information below concerning Georgia is provided
for general reference only, and may not be totally accurate in a particular
location or circumstance.
Safety of Public Transportation:            Fair
Urban Road Conditions/Maintenance:  Poor
Rural Road Conditions/Maintenance:   Poor
Availability of Roadside Assistance:     Poor
As in the United States, vehicular traffic in Georgia moves along the right
side of roadways.  Speed limits range from 80 to 100 km/hr. on highways, and
from 60 to 90 km/hr. on urban thoroughfares.  Motorists are not permitted to
make right turns on red at traffic lights.  While legislation mandating seat
belt use has yet to be enacted, drivers and passengers are nevertheless
strongly advised to buckle-up on Georgian Roads.  Children under seven (7)
years of age are required to be restrained in child-safety seats.  Under
Georgian law, a driver may be considered to be driving under the influence
of alcohol with any blood alcohol concentration exceeding zero.
Inter-City travel in Georgia by bus and public minivan is readily available,
and expanding and improved train service links the capital to most large
cities and towns.  It is also possible to hire private taxis for inter-city
travel at a reasonable cost.
The state road police, who come under the authority of the Ministry of
Internal Affairs, are responsible for maintaining road safety in Georgia.
As many local drivers do not operate their vehicles in accordance with
established road rules, motorists should exercise extreme caution when
driving, and pedestrians should be careful when crossing streets.
Roads in Georgia are generally in poor condition and often lack shoulder
markings and centerlines. In addition, traffic signals may not work as a
result of power outages and burned-out bulbs. Undivided two-lane roads
connect most major cities, and motorists attempting to pass other vehicles
may encounter oncoming high-speed traffic.  Driving at night can be
especially dangerous.  Travel on mountain roads is treacherous in both rain
and snow, and heavy snowfalls may make some roads impassable.  During the
first ten months of the year 2000, 375 traffic related fatalities and 1,670
traffic-related injuries were reported to the state road police.  These
figures indicate that the fatality and injury rate on Georgian roads is
several times the U.S. rate.
For additional information about road safety, including links to foreign
government sites, see the Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs
home page at  html.
AVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT:  As there is no direct commercial air service by
local carriers at present, or economic authority to operate such service,
between the U.S. and Georgia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
has not assessed Georgia's Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with
international aviation safety standards.
For further information, travelers may contact the Department of
Transportation within the U.S. at tel. 1-800-322-7873, or visit the FAA
Internet home page at    The U.S.
Department of Defense (DOD) separately assesses some foreign air carriers
for suitability as official providers of air services. For information
regarding the DOD policy on specific carriers, travelers may contact DOD at
tel. 618-229-4801.
Power outages have occasionally disabled Tbilisi Airport's guidance beacon
for short periods of time, forcing aircraft to land using visual flight
CRIMINAL PENALTIES:  While in a foreign country, a U.S. citizen is subject
to that country's laws and regulations, which sometimes differ significantly
from those in the United States and may not afford the protections available
to the individual under U.S. law. Penalties for breaking the law can be more
severe than in the United States for similar offenses. Persons violating the
laws of Georgia, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.
Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs are strict
and convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.
CURRENCY INFORMATION:  While the Georgian Lari is the only legal tender,
dollars can be freely exchanged for Laris at market rates.  Credit cards are
rarely accepted outside of upscale hotels and restaurants, and travelers'
checks are difficult to cash.
CHILDREN'S ISSUES:  For information on international adoption of children
and international parental child abduction please refer to our Internet site
at  or telephone (202)
REGISTRATION AND EMBASSY LOCATION:  U.S. citizens living in or visiting
Georgia are strongly encouraged to register at the Consular Section of the
U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi, where they may obtain updated information on travel
and security within Georgia.  The U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi is located at 25
Atoneli Street, tel. (995)(32)98-99-67 or (995)(32)98-99-68, fax

MULTIPLAYER QUANTUM GAMES.  Played with atoms and
photons rather than dice and coins, quantum games are contests
whose outcomes are governed by the unusual logic of the
submicroscopic world.   The basic token in a quantum game is a
"qubit," a bit of data which is stored in an object such as an atomic
nucleus.  While a classical coin can only be heads (data value 0) or
tails (data value 1), a qubit can effectively be both heads (0) and
tails (1) at the same time, since the nucleus can be in a
combination or superposition of spin-up (0) and spin-down (1). What's more, one can interlink or "entangle" qubits held by
separate players so that manipulating one qubit strongly affects the
others.  More than a diversion, playing quantum games can reveal
new information-processing tasks (possibly even certain types of
financial transactions) that quantum computers could perform
more efficiently than classical computers.  Towards these ends,
theorists have been taking traditional games, adapting them for the
quantum realm, and checking if new or better strategies emerge for
winning.  While past quantum games have focused on two players
(Update 411), Oxford researchers (Patrick Hayden,
Patrick.hayden have now identified multiplayer games
in which the player's optimal strategy differs from that of the
classical version of the game.  The researchers discovered unique
strategies in a three-player quantum version of the Dilemma game,
in which three partners engaged in a venture (such as getting the
best seats at a concert) each decide whether or not to betray the
others in efforts to maximize personal gain.  In the quantum
version, the qubits are entangled, then each person uses his qubit to
choose between the following strategies: try for good seat (0),
settle for poor seat (1) or some superposition of the two.  Entanglement actually destroys the incentive for a player to
contradict and thereby betray his opponents and it removes the
classical dilemma entirely. Although quantum games are mostly
played on paper at this point, a Chinese group has just reported the
experimental realization of a quantum Prisoner's Dilemma (Los
Alamos preprint quant-ph/0104087).  (Benjamin and Hayden,

It's a shame that Niels Provos, one of the main developers of open-source
Steganography software at the moment wasn't able to detect a single piece
of information hidden steganographically in a recent survey of two million
images...  Sort of destroys the whole hype about the use of it by
criminals.   Details on the paper below:
Detecting Steganographic Content on the Internet
Niels Provos and Peter Honeyman
Steganography is used to hide the occurrence of communication. Recent
suggestions in US newspapers indicate that terrorists use steganography to
communicate in secret with their accomplices. In particular, images on the
internet were mentioned as the communication medium. While the newspaper
articles sounded very dire, none substantiated these rumors. To determine
whether there is steganographic content on the Internet, this paper presents
a detection framework that includes tools to retrieve images from the world
wide web and automatically detects whether they might contain steganographic
content. To ascertain that hidden messages exist in images, the detection
framework includes a distributed computing framework for launching dictionary
attacks hosted on a cluster of loosely coupled workstations. We have analyzed
two million images downloaded from eBay actions but have not been able to
find a single hidden message.

Reply-To: psychohistory
Terror Attacks: A Psychohistorical view
By Christos Z. Konstas
A first word:
I feel that enough days have passed since the bombing and now we can look
upon the events in a more cool-headed manner.
It is still difficult to address the issue of the recent terrorist attacks
in the USA, but some things need to be said -and discussed - before the
situation deteriorate more.
Every crime, why, every action in our world, needs three factors in order to
take place:
1. The opportunity
2. The means, and behind them all,
3. The motives
The recent criminal terrorist attacks are no exception to this. Before the
execution of the acts these three factors where already in place and in
order to understand the events we need to examine each one. For us
interested in Asimovian Psychohistory this means to examine them under the
light of it.
I want to examine the facts, and stay with them with as little
interpretation, as possible, and as little second-guessing as possible too,
though that may be occasionally unavoidable. Then I want to try to put the
facts into numbers in order to be able to get some calculated results out of
Regretfully it is going to be a rough, low resolution analysis. Nevertheless
it will give us a crude but real picture.
Opportunity, means, motives. These are key factors to the events and our
understanding them will give us the chance to neutralize them too, if we
want to minimize the chances of similar events will happening in the future.
Before looking at them we can divide those responsible for the attacks to
two obvious categories (groups):
a. Those who survived, and
b. Those who didn't survive.
These two categories differ not only by the outcome: survivors/non-survivors
but also by the different roles they played and by their motives too.
You see in group (a) belong all those who are behind the acts, the master
minds that designed them, their financiers, patrons etc.
In group (b) belong those who executed the acts and those are the ones that
I will examine first.
As a group is the most complex one and their motives cannot be explained by
simply labeling them as 'evil', something that could be said about the first
group, but more on this later.
Group (a)
1. Opportunities. These come and go. Sometimes a 'window' opens for a brief
time and then closes again. The opportunity in these particular events was
given by Time. The precise timing of the attack and the passing of time.
Facts: There had been some time since the last terrorist attack in the US
and 'guards' was down. Statistically, now and then opportunities for
terrorist hits arise and when the attack comes at 'right' moment their
success is entirely possible.
A lot can be done and is done towards the elimination of such opportunities.
You've heard it all, I'm sure, thorough airport checks etc. However those
with the motives and the means for terrorist acts are always looking for
such opportunities and statistically sooner or later they will succeed in
finding and taking advantage of them.
2. Means. They are the 'weapon', the tools of the execution. Again measures
taken against the means of a terrorist act can be very successful but time
and resourcefulness work for the terrorists.
Fact: This time they used knives, box cutters and commercial airliners.
There is no defense against the strongly motivated use of common everyday
things as weapons. Even a fork can do a lot of damage. Can you imagine the
paranoia of scanning passengers for forks? Again given time events of low
probability can happen too.
So we reach the single most important factor of everything: Motivation
3. Motives. Ultimately they are the most important factor, because in their
absence nobody bothers to act.
Facts: It is indisputable that the hijackers where highly motivated, they
sacrificed their lives after all for their cause.
That some people are sufficiently motivated to commit such acts to a degree
to give their lives in the process needs further examination. Because only
by eliminating the motives that makes them to act suicidal can we ensure an
adequate lowering of the probability of acts like that happening again.
Question1: Why they did it?
Question2: What can motivate a person thus?
Question3: What were their actual motives.
Answers: The first and most publicly discussed 'motive' is that they were
'religious fanatics'. Although that is a strong possibility leaves a lot of
questions unanswered and don't give a detailed picture of the hijackers. For
example: What turned them into religious fanatics? Even if they were
religious fanatics, what made the religious fanatics? Brainwashing, intense
indoctrination, money, love, hate? What?
The hijackers weren't, to all indications, illiterate savages, most had
probably had spend time living in the US, had studied in US colleges, some
knew how to pilot aircraft etc. Moreover the idea of them being just
religious fanatics oversimplifies things. If we think that this was their
only motive, we need not investigate their motives any further. It's the
absolute answer, blame it to fanaticism and stop worrying. But that is
misleading and give up a wrong or at least an incomplete picture.
Thus 'religious fanaticism' an answer is, for the time being, at least
incomplete, and until it answers more questions than it raises this motive
will be considered of secondary importance.
The most natural answer is that something made these people desperate enough
to act in the way they acted.
First interlude.
I want to bring to your attention, two loosely related facts, and the
questions that rise from them:
1. There where celebrations in Palestine and Iraq. As a contrast to those
celebrations I saw someone on the CNN wondering over them as seen under the
light of the tragedy and the pain the victims still suffer. Question: Are
the people of Palestine and Iraq so cynical in front of the pain and the
losses of innocent lives?
2. For many people it's hard to accept why there is so much hatred,
genocides and atrocities in the world. Yet all those are hard facts of life
and the very difficulty some people face in accepting these facts indicate a
lack of information. You see when one has all the information of the causes
the effects should be obvious, that's what Psychohistory hopes anyway.
Question: to what information I'm referring?
Honest answers could be painful but will guarantee a better comprehension of
the recent events.
Facts  in numbers
Now we have a number of those people motivated to commit suicidal terrorists
acts. It is reported that they were about 24. The precise number is
irrelevant. Lets call their number 'T'.
That 'T' number of willing to die terrorists did not came out of thin air.
They came from a larger pool of candidates of 'C' number and we know that
greed and personal profit was not their motive because they knew they would
What do all these 'C' people had in common? Perhaps many things, but one is
very relevant here. They all shared an intense hate toward the USA. A hate
that made them insensitive to the knowledge that blind terrorist acts mainly
hurt innocent people. So there is an 'H' number of people that hates the USA
enough to make them hurt the innocent. Now this 'H' number obviously come
from even greater number of people that something in their lives made them
to hate the USA. They cannot be people who profit by the US policies.
Religion alone is not an important factor here. Islam is not by definition
anti-US, it's not by definition pro-Arab either. They must be people who are
or feel personally damaged by the US policies. Given the extent of US
influence around the globe there must be a 'D' number of people who are
displeased by the US, but these people must be very displeased indeed.
Question: What did make them so displeased in the USA?
Second Interlude
No we have a rough form of an equation here:
We initially have a pool of D number of people out of which comes a T number
of suicidal terrorist:
Where does this D number of people comes from?
Historical Fact sheet 1:
The USA during the last 30 years (that is since 1971) have:
Mercilessly bombed three countries:
Invaded two countries:
Placed various types of - common people affecting - sanctions against:
N. Korea
Military intervered in:
Also intervered in:
El Salvador
I'm surely missing out some countries but I think I've made my point.
Fact sheet 2
Many of the current US menaces were initially financed and helped by the US
before they become the US archenemies:
Noriega of Panama
Saddam of Iraq
And. Ossama Bin Ladden
They all were tenderly cared by the US at some point.
All those facts are indisputable. One can defend such US actions as having
'right' reasons. In this study that's irrelevant.
Even if all those actions were for the best of reasons, which is debatable,
as an aftereffect they resulted in the creation of a very specific group of
people. Innocent people that saw their lives, properties, houses, destroyed,
themselves hurt or injured and their loved ones and relatives dead, all
because they happened to be in the wrong place of the world or the wrong
side of a conflict. These are the 'D' people described above.
There are two lines of action that can be suggested from this
Psychohistorical study of the recent bombings in the USA.
A. A thorough check on the past of people entering the USA will show who of
them have, potentially, a reason to hate the US. Those who have seen their
lives damaged because they happened to be 'collateral damage' in one of the
US military actions are obviously more prone to suicidal 'religious
fanaticism'. Will work for a short term but a more effective one will be the
B. The best way to limit the number of willing to die terrorists (T) is to
reduce the (D) number of people that are hurt by American policies. That
will work better in the long run. Just think that an average of 5000
children die each month in Iraq because the US sanctions. That results in at
least 10000 people who are very displeased with USA. Now that's a big tank
from which any clever 'religious fanatic' usurper can tap for human
Under this light Madeleine's Albright  comment that 'they think' of it all
that 'the price is worth it (were the price is the dead Iraqi children)' is
suddenly less convincing. Is it not?

"To strike at the mother country where it was most vulnerable, embargoes
were declared on all British goods carrying import duties. And the Sons of
Liberty attacked anyone who did not observe the ban by the liberal use of
tar and feathers and riding a rail.
The fiercest opposition to Britian's revenue laws was staged in Boston,
the principal port of Massachusetts, where a militant group of agitators -
led by an ex-tax collector, Samuel Adams, and a local merchant, John
Hancock - conducted a campaign that skillfully combined violence and
sophisticated legal and political strategy. Radicals were now sitting not

that governed the colony."

@_subject: Re: [psychohistory] What can a Society Do? 
???? That sentence is without meaning as worded.
But that's exactly(!) why Arrow's applies. Fairness (ie democratic) as
individual choice (ie vote).
The fact that there are no democratic (ie fair) mechanisms by which to
make selections is what damns Crypt-Anarchic-Capitalist-Libertarian (CACL)
thought. A good example is to apply voting theory to David Friedmans law
by contract examples.
One can cast CACL thought as democratic thought except for a single
difference. Democratic thought requires all to be responsible to the same
set of rules and policies. CACL doesn't.
CACL thought has three fundamental flaws. One, it requires individuals to
behave in a manner inconsistent with their biology. People ain't rational
in any sort of consistent manner. Second, it says that if we get rid of
government people will resolve their own problems. However, this statement
can be turned into a 'democratic election' (ie the participants have their
own choices to make - a vote) yet we can prove mathematically that such a
solution is impossible if there are more than two (2) participants. Now I
don't know about you but anything worthy of the label 'society' must have
more than two (2) people involved. Finaly, it assumes that all issues and
decisions one makes in life can be reduced to 'economic' decisions. While
that is certainly possible it is clear that not all issues are deal with
equitably in such a manner.
(It's also applicable to Tim May's commentary a while back about the
'solved n-division' problem (which can also be shown to be a vote if the
remainder is indivisible or can't be re-connected) and the fact that he
seems to think that the solution that is out there now is universal. When
in fact it applies to such a small fraction of n-division problems as to
be worthless. The proof is in the 'remainder' and it's characteristics.
Most of reality doesn't comply with the requirements for 'fair
divisibility' - too granular.)
But a social system isn't (just) a 'system of rules'. It also has beliefs
and various cause-effect and dependency issues related to environment and
biology that cause Godel's to be inapplicable. The fact that it consists
of anything(!) more than a system of rules is enough to invalidate
Godel's. Godel's simply isn't applicable to a broad enough set of
examples. Though Godel's may keep you from proving it). The reality is
that the concept of 'social system' is entirely too broad for the conept
of 'self-consistent language' to be applied. Where did the requirement for
'consistency' in a social setting come from in the first place? And what
does 'consistency' actually mean in that context? A naive interpretation
might be that they always make decisions the same way or perhaps the same
selection. Either will fail because it won't respond to changes in the
environment. Clearly in conflict with the premise of being 'consistent'.

EVIDENCE FOR A RE-IONIZATION ERA in the early universe
[SSZ: text deleted]
SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AT 117 K IN A BUCKYBALL CRYSTAL has been observed by
[SSZ: text deleted]
LASER-LIKE AMPLIFICATION OF ENTANGLED PARTICLES has been achieved by a
University of Oxford team. Governed by quantum physics, entangled particles have much stronger correlations, or interrelationships, than anything
allowed in classical physics.  For example, measuring one entangled
particle instantly influences its partner's state, even if the two
particles are separated by great distances.  Entangled particles are
the bread-and-butter of quantum information schemes such as
quantum cryptography, quantum computing, and quantum
teleportation.  But they are notoriously difficult to create in bulk. To create entangled photons, for example, researchers can send
laser light through a barium borate crystal.  Passing through the
crystal, a photon sometimes splits into two entangled photons
(each with half the energy of the initial photon).  However, this
only occurs for one in every ten billion incoming photons. To
increase the yield, the Oxford researchers added a step: they put
mirrors beyond the crystal so that the laser pulse and entangled
pair could reflect, and have the chance to interact.  Since the
entangled pair and reflected laser pulse behave as waves, quantum
mechanics says that they could interfere constructively to generate
fourfold more two-photon pairs or interfere destructively to create
zero pairs.  Following these steps, the researchers increased
production of two-photon entangled pairs and also of rarer states
such as four-photon entangled quartets.  This achievement could
represent a step towards an entangled-photon laser, which would
repeatedly amplify entangled particles to create greater yields than
previously possible, and also towards the creation of new and more
complex kinds of entangled states.  (Lamas-Linares et al., Nature,
30 August 2001.)

you if you get too nutty. They also tend to outlaw fast draws (some won't
even let you wear a pistol in a holster while on the range) and other such
So we see that gun ranges don't allow anyone/everyone to run around armed
and operating equally.
As a result, your point is bogus.

Reply-To: psychohistory

    "Psychohistory Originally: RE: TERRORISM: looking for solutions
The concept of trustability has its roots in Game Theory.
1) Without trust, a society will function only on its lowest denominator, if we consider it a society at all. People will only look out for their self-interests and would not perceive to preemptively strike those they perceive as a threat, to ensure their own survival.
2) To create trust without a free information flow, the most common solution would require establishing a hierarchy. In such an organization (e.g. Governments), by virtue of the inequality of power, can track and punish individuals who infringe on trust and thus maintain a working level of trustfulness (and also a related concept called security).
3) A society without any structure, if it has to function efficiently, would have to self-create a Government. thus, anarchism would not work because it would sow its seeds for its own destruction. Humans have an instinct to form groups (of whose's members they can trust much more than others) thanks to evolution selecting out anti-social humans.
Notes: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem forbids any system that claims to cater for all people in all situations. Surely, the claims by capitalist-anarchists do not work because of such. While the Theory of Evolution may *appear* to apply to human society, it fails (as the Theorm predicts) to apply to human societies because humans can and will think out of the system. Placed in simple terms, humans can and do exploit the social systems they encounter. This ability confers the ability to lie, to see through paradoxes and to "make-believe", and confers the greatest difference between a human and a Turing machine. Evolution Theory applies well only to beings simple enough to remain within the system rules.
4) The fastest way to create trust would require the removal of the ability to make deceit in all of us, or our disire to do so. While we know this has high impossibility, we can approximate something like that by:
a. Having a free flow of *all* information, including what we consider as private
b. Having a group of people capable of handling such free flow of information (such as those not prone to gossip)
c. the exclusion of people who refuse, or has insufficient ability to participate in such open-ness
Notes: There does exist groups of people who do not, or cannot make deceit. Please visit  for more information.
Considering this point further, you may want to refer to the Theory of Sociologistics [sociologistics.webhop.org]. I base my assumptions on the above three conclusions that I can draw, and with some other goals. These include:
1) The Freedom to Self-Actualisation [similiar: The right to (lead a meaningful) life]
Those of us with sufficient intelligence to wonder about the purpose or meaning of our life, has the potential and probably the disire to lead a life in accordance to one's purpose. In our societies, we often cannot do so because we do not have a proper social system that allows (or even recognises) this.
For instance, a lot of us have to work in jobs we dislike so that we can just survive. Someone once wrote that a life not worth writing about does not worth living too, yet too many of us have to lead such lives without a means to reject or escape from it.
Project Sociologistics aims to create a social system (in theory) that supports such a fundamental "right", as long as such pursuit of self-actualisation aims to understand the universe and conducted in an ethical manner.
This means that as a astrophysicts, one will not need to play politics to gain funds, but merely to allow others to evaluate one's proposal in an open and logical manner. It means your can pursue your projects of seeking knowledge without worrying about survival, or making a living, lack of resources, or other irrelevant barriers that stop it, at least in theory.
2) Freedom from Mundane Issues
Our societies operate with such a high level of inefficiency that I find it amazing that we managed to achieve so much despite such inefficiencies. The largest contributor of inefficiency lies with the Governments which impose rules to maintain the operation of our societies within their pre-defined "safe" limits.
Not recognizing Godel's Theorem, these Governments create rules that don't work, or work poorly. These governments make things worse by:
a. not utilising adequate Information Systems
b. allowing public contribution
c. allowing full public disclousure of their internal workings
d. applying the latest in social research
e. and most importantly of all, discouraging public participation directly and indirectly (such as by establishing a complex system of rules and organisations that removes the ability or individuals to act)
As such, those who control Governments gain opportunities to abuse their power, and those controlled by Governments, meanwhile, have to put up with inefficiencies that can sometimes have such severity that it threatens their lives.
While there exists people who believe that the solution lies with abolishing Governments as we know them, their solution of anarchism still cannot solve the same fundamental issue with the human ingenuity at systems exploitation. Meanwhile, some of the more moderate advocates of individual empowerment believe that the idea of using the system of "checks and balances" and forming a minimum Government would solve the problem. However, their rules of ensuring no abuse will not work, due to Godel's Theorem.
Thus, any system based on rules alone cannot work, neither can a system merely based on symmetrical power (i.e. anachism) as such symmetries have very low stability.
I realised that the key could lie in the members of a society. Even thought sentient beings such as humans, capable of trans-Godel self-referential thinking, must have internal inconsistencies since they can experience a more or less complete range of experiences, they can keep the inconsistency as low as possible by training in science and logic.
In such a manner, they can control their inconsistencies (such as by applying it to creative problem solving) instead of letting these run amok such as in wars or the latest terrorist bombing. I label such people as rational people, and these, would no doubt have the qualifications to participate in the New Colony project (i.e. the applied form of Project Sociologistics).
Even though they still have inconsistencies, they can operate below the threshold of chaotic social functioning, and thus we can design bare minimum systems that can support them and let them develop the rest by themselves without worrying of systems exploitation. They will understand that, if they have to choose to sacrifice some of their self-interests (such as by giving up opportunities to let the more needy have them first) in order to maximise the public good.
3) Freedom to Transcend
this goes beyond the freedom to think, or of free speech. If you notice, the three freedoms overlap each other. The provision of this freedom allows people to seek to transcend themselves, for instance, uploading their minds into another (probably electronic) medium so as to gain various advantages.
In this society, we shall not overly concern ourselves with the concept of "God" getting angry at our self-experimentation, or the prejudice against sentient computers. We shall bravely go where no one has gone before in our exploration of the Universe.
4) Freedom to Trust
What good would we, to live in a society of whom members we cannot trust. This freedom provides for high levels of trust among a society's own members, such as by disclosure of all data each one has on everything. It facilitates, via unity, the ability to execute projects that require many people. If everyone will trust each other like a mother with a child, our societies will have much lesser problems.
In practice, new members will usually enjoy a lower level of trust than incumbent ones, and spies could exist, but how we will solve this issue and related others, would come in the paper of Sociologistics and not in this article.
This has a lot of overlap with the (unlisted) Freedom to Publish (or "Free Speech"), where one can publish one's views freely. With the freedom to trust, we no longer perceive publishing views as a "right", but as an obligation to help other members achieve more knowledge.
5) Freedom of Non-Interference
Last but not least, this last freedom aims to take into account people with other goals and beliefs. This aims to respect tha choices by people, even if they choose a path fraught with excessive suffering than one which allows them to transcend.
This applies to the society both ways, in that it will not interfere in other's affairs if they don't interfere with it, and the hope that others will also comply with this rule. This also applies on the microscopic manner, where one seeks not to interfere with each other's activity unless one has his or her interests threatened.
In my writings on the Paradox of Free Speech & Integration, I had shown that a society with even one irrational individual can wreak havoc with the implementation of "Free Speech" by introducing conflicts, which one must resolve by censorship (and thus go against free speech) or expulsion of that individual. Now, I can add the option of a difficult process of working within the irrationality to resolve the issue.
Notes: The current version, and various parts of the Theory itself, requires a significant rewrite to integrate Godel's Theorem and the concepts of Game Theory into them. I recognize the limitations of my knowledge and ability and thus aim to progressive update and complete the theory as much as I can. Meanwhile, my hopes for higher level of participation seems to have diminished for now.
Clearly, creating an independent rational society by taking over another nation would just spur military action, but also face uncooperation among the irrational people who would break the system of trust. Hence, I recommended, and continue to recommend, the setting up of a colony in unclaimed or purchased land or space. Making a colony work gets difficult enough, but having to fend off military attacks while doing so, will make it almost impossible to work. Converting an irrational to an rational one would sounds so impossible that I think this problem does not have enough worth to justify assigning our computing resources to solve it.
hence, I hope with this posting, to provide some hints on how we can construct a society based on trust. I hope it helps. Please read the paper, or part of it, before formulating the reply, as you could contribute redundant points that I would find reluctant to reply due to insufficient time.

Slander is harming another. The fact that speech is involved is irrelevant
to the fact you're causing measurable harm to another. Simply because you
use speech as some component, and speech is protected, doesn't mean the
larger process should inherit the protection.

Not at all. It's recognizing a significant, but subtle distinction. One

Are we seeing the beginning of the end of the concept of 'nation'? Are we
faced with the incontrovertible truth that we either abandon the concepts
of science/technology, accept a autocratic state where our every move is
reviewed for threat potential, or do we find another solution to the
problems of mankind other than the 'state'? Are these the only three
It is clear that any assault on 'method' will fail because there is an
infinite regress. Instead we should focus on 'motive' since if a person is
never motivated to commit the act in the first place the 'method' becomes
moot. This raises the question of what does 'individual' or 'independent'
mean in a technology filled world?
It is also clear that CACL solutions won't work, the example of armed
aircraft passengers during a high-jack clearly demonstrates how such
confrontations can be turned against the passengers to their own
detriment. Their very biological nature makes such solutions unworkable.
Is it time that all forms of human government recognize the fundamental
limits imposed by physics (something even CACL theory doesn't do)? Whatever solution works must include some form of neutral third party
conflict resolution mechanism. And the solutions of that mechanism must
not resort to forceful coercion. It must recognize the fundamental right
of the individual to not go along with the majority in (nearly?) all
Is it time we recognize that the good of the many doesn't outweight the
needs of the few in all cases? And that in any case the initiation of
violence (physical or not) is never justified? That irrespective of the
issue forcing someone to participate only creates more problems in the
future that any possible good that may come from forcing the current
resolution? That these problems will pile up until there is no solution
other than a complete 'reboot'? That individuals have a fundamental right to say "No, I won't participate" irrespective of the issue? That in fact
Lincolns 'universal law of nations' is nothing more than a scam? Does the
threat of future technology applications justify abandoning those
applications? Do we put a cap on our lifestyle?
I propose that the only solution isn't forcing people to participate but
rather offering voluntary opportunities to participate. Buy their
cooperation. Is this the true future of 'economics'?

The fact is that you draw a specious distinction as to attacking one group

mothers. Unless of course it's us doing the killing, for whatever reason
we've used to justify it.
Really? How? Why is attacking imperial soldiers on land they believe is
theirs any different?
Seems to me that if one takes active, supportive measures with respect to
their government they can hardly call themselves 'innocent'.
Who were these people paying taxes for a war they knew nothing of? This
certainly didn't apply to the British. The general populace was informed
as to what was going on.

I understand your point. It's specious. The distinction you try to draw is
based on a flawed morality. You believe that there is some effective
difference between attacking a soldier of a country, and the mother of
that soldier. That somehow attacking only certain aspects of a society are
allowed. Then when 'your' side commits equal acts they are somehow
justified because 'your' side is the 'right' side. That somehow the people
who vote to put a certain contingent in charge are then somehow insulated
from the consequences of the acts of those representatives.
So much for "Of the people, By the people, For the people".
The fact is that there are no 'innocents'. There never were.
The British certainly didn't see it that way. They saw some group of
miscreants raising hell in THEIR country. People it's worth noting a
significant fraction of which were not generaly born in this country.

U.S. Department of State
Washington, D.C.
FACT SHEET
CHEMICAL - BIOLOGICAL AGENTS
The recent terrorist threats and confirmed cases of exposure to anthrax have
caused an increase in anxiety over the possibility of chemical and
biological attacks (CBA).  Currently, the method of delivery of anthrax has
been by letter or package.  While the risk of such attacks is limited, it
cannot be excluded.  As always, the Department will promptly share with
American citizens overseas any credible information about threats to their
safety.  Americans should stay informed and be prepared for any eventuality.
In 1999, the Department of Defense announced its intention to commence the
Family and Force Protection Initiative (FFPI) in order to provide enhanced
protection to the dependents of U.S. military service members and to
civilian Department of Defense (DOD) employees and their families. This
program was first implemented for U.S. Forces Korea.
The Department of State has had a chemical and biological countermeasure
program since 1998, when it began to deploy chemical antidotes and
antibiotics to selected posts abroad.   While we have no information to
indicate there is an imminent threat from use of anthrax or other biological
agents as a weapon against our overseas missions at this time, the
Department is expanding its countermeasure program.   As a precaution, the
Department requested our missions overseas to stock a three-day supply of
the antibiotic ciprofloxacin for all individuals who work in or frequent the
This small supply of ciprofloxacin is being pre-positioned to ensure rapid
access to this protective antibiotic for our employees in case of an Anthrax
exposure in an overseas USG facility and would allow the mission sufficient
time to provide access to care for all individuals exposed while securing
additional supplies of antibiotics.  Once an exposure is suspected, all
individuals who had been exposed in our workplace would be provided
antibiotics pending a full investigation of the exposure. This would include
any private American citizen present in the facility at the time of
Again, if the Department becomes aware of any specific and credible threat
to the safety and security of American citizens abroad, that information
will be provided to them promptly.
Exposures to CBA that occur outside USG facilities would require the
involvement of local public health authorities who would provide information
and if necessary, protective antibiotics to the general public.
Ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics effective against Anthrax, including
doxycycline and amoxicillin are available with a prescription in most
pharmacies throughout the world.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the lead government
agency on infectious diseases, including chemical/biological agents (CBA).
For detailed information on CBA, including Anthrax, inquirers are referred
to the CDC Internet home page at  The CDC's international
travelers hotline telephone number is 1-877-FYI-TRIP (1-877-394-8747);

As always, American citizens should review their own personal security
situations and take those precautions they deem appropriate to ensure their
Some general information on chemical-biological agents (CBA) follows:
A.      Biological agents can be dispersed by an aerosol spray that must be
inhaled. However, these agents can also be used to contaminate food, water
and other products. Attention to basic food hygiene when traveling abroad is
very important.
A.      Some chemical agents may be volatile--evaporating rapidly to form
clouds of agent. Others may be persistent. These agents may act directly on
the skin, lungs, eyes, respiratory tract or be absorbed through your skin
and lungs causing injury.  Choking and nerve agents damage the soft tissue
in these organs.
A.      When properly used, appropriate masks are effective protection to
prevent the inhalation of either biological or chemical agents; however this
assumes an adequate warning. Gas masks alone do not protect against agents
that act through skin absorption.  Those who wish to acquire protective
equipment for personal use should contact commercial vendors.
A.      There is an incubation period after exposure to biological agents.
It is essential that you seek appropriate care for illnesses acquired while
traveling abroad to assure prompt diagnosis and treatment.
A.      One of the biological warfare agents is the spore-forming bacterium
that causes Anthrax, an acute infectious disease.  It should be noted,
however, that effective dispersal of the Anthrax bacteria is difficult.
*       Anthrax is treatable if that treatment is initiated promptly after
exposure. The post-exposure treatment consists of certain antibiotics
administered in combination with the vaccine.
*       An anthrax vaccine that confers protective immunity does exist, but
is not readily available to private parties.  Efficacy and safety of use of
this vaccine for persons under 18 or over 65 and pregnant women have not
been determined.
*       The anthrax vaccine is produced exclusively by Bioport under
contract to the Department of Defense.  Virtually all vaccine produced in
the United States is under Defense Department contract primarily for
military use and a small number of other official government uses.
*       For additional information, please consult your health care provider
or local health authority.

FIPR Press release: FOR IMMEDIATE USE : 16th October 2001
EMERGENCY POWERS ALLOW MASS-SURVEILLANCE FOR NON-TERRORIST
*) Home Office undecided whether ISP data retention to be voluntary or
compulsory *) Data revealing who you talk to, what you read, where you are,
collected for "national security"
*) Data can be trawled for public order, minor crimes, tax, health and
*) E-Commerce to bear open-ended storage and data-protection compliance
As part of an emergency package of anti-terrorism measures, Home
Secretary David Blunkett announced yesterday (Note 3) that Internet
Service Providers would be "enabled" to retain logs detailing the online
activity of their customers (but NOT the contents of communications).
Data protection legislation (Note 4) currently protects electronic
privacy by prohibiting blanket storage by ISPs of logs recording such
details as websites browsed, To and From addresses of e-mails, and which
'newsgroup' articles are read by a subscriber. Other "communications
data", such as the telephone number used to dial-up the Internet, may be
kept so long as it is relevant to billing or fraud control.
Although Mr.Blunkett's use of the word "enable" (rather than "require")
implied that compliance will be at the ISP's discretion, the lead
official told FIPR that retention may be made compulsory, enforced
through civil law. The same source said a ministerial certificate will
assert "national security" exemptions (Note 5) so that ISPs and
telephone companies will not be in breach of European Directives. The
government will only specify later exactly what data may be collected
and for how long in a Code of Practice in consultation with ISPs. No new legislation is necessary for police and intelligence agencies to
collect the data once it is recorded by ISPs and telephone companies. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Act 2000 (Note 5) allows
records to be obtained for broad purposes including tax, health and
safety, public order offences and minor crime. Although "communications
data" provides a complete map of private life, revealing who you talk
to, what you read, and where you go, the authorities can rubber-stamp
compilation and trawling of large and detailed databases. In contrast,
inspection of the contents of a single e-mail requires a warrant from a
Secretary of State, and a search for documents requires a court order.
Bulk requests can be made on groups or the history of an individual and
kept by police and intelligence agencies indefinitely under data
protection exemptions. This includes the exact co-ordinates of your
geographic location - which 3rd-generation mobiles produce continuously
whilst the phone is switched on.
Computerised 'traffic analysis' (tracing links between individuals) is a
powerful new form of mass-surveillance, but is only efficient at keeping
tabs on the law-abiding. Professional terrorists know how to cover their
tracks - for example throw-away use of pre-paid mobile phones. Reports
of the modus operandi of the September 11th terrorists indicate they
used Web-based e-mail from public terminals. Clearly it is not
persuasive to argue for privacy to be sacrificed in the name of fighting
terrorism if the measures would not in fact be effective.
A leaked report from the National Criminal Intelligence Service last
year revealed that police and security agencies are nevertheless
pressing for a mandatory data retention law to warehouse the traffic
data of the entire population for several years
( Blunkett's proposals amount to
blanket 'dataveillance' for non-terrorist investigations, using the the
tragic events of Sep 11 as justification.
Providers of e-commerce authentication services could be affected as
well as ISPs and telcos. Anyone offering "provision of access to, and of
facilities for making use of...the transmission of communications" [RIP
S.22(4) & S.1 defs] could face extra costs of providing suitable storage
devices and media, and full compliance with data protection legislation.
Caspar Bowden, director of Internet think-tank FIPR (Foundation for
Information Policy Research) commented:
"Sensitive data revealing what you read, where you are, and who you talk
to online could be collected in the name of national security. But
Mr.Blunkett intends to allow access to this data for purposes nothing to
do with fighting terrorism. Minor crimes, public order and tax offences,
attendance at demonstrations, even 'health and safety' will be
legitimate reasons to siphon sensitive details of private life into
government databases to be retained indefinitely. This would be in
flagrant breach of the first and second Data Protection Principles."

QUANTUM FINGERPRINTING.  Imagine two offices, located
halfway around the world, and their headquarters wants to make
sure that they each have the identical copy of a database.  Imagine
further that the databases are huge--10^20 bits each.  They could
transmit the database to the headquarters, and the headquarters
could compare them.  But transmitting 10^20 bits--equal to about
11 billion gigabytes would take an enormous amount of time.
There is a method in which they only need to send 10^10 bits--a
little over a gigabyte--and the headquarters still gets enough
information to determine that they have the exact same database. This method is called "classical fingerprinting."  The idea is that
each office independently, without communicating to each other,
generates a distinctive number, called a fingerprint, by performing
a calculation involving the entire database and locally generated
random numbers, called keys.  The result of the calculation-a
fingerprint of 10^10 bits--is then sent to the headquarters.  Now, a
Dutch-Canadian team (Harry Buhrman, CWI/University of
Amsterdam, 011-31-20-5924076, buhrman has suggested
a "quantum fingerprinting" scheme which would involve an
exponentially smaller transmission of information to do the same
job.  For the 10^20 bit database, each office would only have to
transmit a fingerprint of about 70 "quantum bits" (qubits), which
could be, for example, specially prepared photons.  Such photons
could contain the result of a computation between the database and
many different random keys simultaneously, rather than a single
random key.  The researchers say that one could demonstrate this
new fingerprinting technique with quantum computers not much
more complex than the ones that exist today.  Buhrman estimates
that quantum fingerprinting becomes more efficient than classical
fingerprinting in a quantum computer with 5 to 10 qubits.  (H.

Edge detection and sharpening software is my friend. If it's an object in
the frame, contrast to the entire frame, that is being target then run a
simple edge detector on a blit, find the CG, stack CG in subsequent
frames. Average, sharpen, edge detect, add back into original (ie stack

BEC ON A CHIP.  First it was neutral atoms guided along a wire
(Update 416).  Then it was a beam of atoms steered over the surface
of a microchip (Update 486).  Now the latest feat of atom optics,
performed by a group at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, is the
creation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of rubidium atoms in a
microscopic magnetic trap built into a lithographically patterned
chip.  Not only was this the fastest-formed BEC (it took only 700 ms
to form, faster even than the all-optical BEC method reporter earlier
this year see Update 545) but the condensate can be maneuvered
around the microchip a few microns above the surface (see Update
516); in fact the condensate was moved a distance of 1.6 mm.  This
capability opens up the possibility of numerous atomtronic
applications in interferometry, quantum computing, navigation,
lithography, holography, and entanglement experiments.  (Hansel et
al., Nature, 4 October 2001.)

This may be the first time in history that the names J.P. Morgan and Max
Levchin have been used in the same sentence. On the surface, the two men
don't seem to have much in common. Morgan died in 1913. Levchin was born in
1975. Morgan was an American-born financier, scion of an international
banking family and stalwart of the Episcopal Church. Levchin is a
Ukrainian-born computer programmer, a Jew who immigrated to Chicago with
his parents when he was 16 years old. Morgan was one of the world's great
art collectors. Levchin's art collection, at the moment I am writing this,
consists of a couple posters and an electric wall clock that has plastic
sushi in place of numbers. Yet J.P. Morgan and Max Levchin stand like
bookends around the story I will be trying to tell next week in my new
show, "Electric Money," which is supposed to air generally around 9 p.m. on
October 3rd. Check your local listings. If, like me, you have only
satellite TV, the show plays on October 4th.
 From its founding in 1871 until the death of its founder in 1913, J.P.
Morgan & Co. came to dominate investment banking in America. This was a
time of little regulation or taxation, a time of dramatic booms and busts,
and a time when the center of the financial world was moved from London to
New York. Morgan did that. He financed America's railroads, its steel
industry, its electric and telephone industries. Twice -- in 1895 and 1907

These people have jobs that suck. The thesis is that they should take
higher paying jobs. Assuming there are such jobs, why aren't they taking

This isn't 'government' (statist or otherwise), it's human psychology.
The bottom line is there is always some segement of any(!) human

irrespective of the form of social structure they may be in.
This is the fundamental failure of all CACL theory. It draws a false
distinction between 'government' and 'people'. It's a simple failure of
logic, imagination, and maturity.

Nonsense. What we should do is bring them under rule of law and ensure
that their efforts are rewarded with an equitable share of the profits
their efforts created. The very basis of free market economies, one is
rewarded FAIRLY for their efforts.
The real question, one that is probably unanswerable, is who gets to
decide what is 'fair'. Not only is there no 'fair' way to decide, but
there's no one universal definition of 'fair'.
So, whatever system we put in place must be based on relative
methodologies and measures. The next question is who gets to decide those,
followed by who gets to exercise them.
So, we need a system that is equitable (with respect to access),
representative (in the sense of everyone has a say in it), and limited (in
that some behaviours are outside the bounds of regulation - speech,
personal possession of a firearm).
C-A-C-L doesn't qualify on several points.

Yes, very particularly in fact.
Being 'first' doesn't imply they were 'alone'. You misrepresent reality
to your own end.
What happened is there were a cloud of near-miss OS'es. In the case of
Unix it was the right one becuase of its scale and the mechanism it was
distributed by (it's development process was also out of the ordinary not
being some massive long running committee) and the particular pardigms
that it chose to use. There was a low cost distribution mechanism so
curious people could buy in for a low cost.
The same can be said for Linux, but in that case there were many factors. FSF was around and pushing Hurd but they were looking for somebody else to do
it. Minix and other near-miss kernels had been around for a few years so
its not like Linux poped out of thin air. There was no low cost
distribution mechanism that was popular prior to about '94. It's no
accident that Linux took off at the same time that the Internet in general
took off (about '94).
In both cases it was synergy of issues. The license being a key, but not
singular component (as you would have us believe). Another factor of equal
if not greater import was the cost/ease of actual/physical distribution.

??? Plan 9 was released Open Source in 2000. Prior to that it had a weird
'no commercial use' clauses. It apparently was intended as a internal use
only project. Forces both internal and external began fighting for the
release of the Rev. 2 code (which turns out can't be done) so instead Pike
and the others created a Rev. 3. They are now working on what is called
the "2000 Release". Haven't had a chance to try it yet.
None, see commentary above. I've been an avid follower of Plan 9 since '86
when the first papers started to appear. It's current state with respect
to apps is about where Linux was in '92. With respect to the code, it
works and works well. The fathers of Unix did as good a job here as well.
 Ask me if I care.
Read Lessigs "Code".
Meaning that through your I/O server you see an effective pool of many
processors on which you can then use to execute your programs. It means
that the filesystem components that appear 'local' may actually not be. It
means that things like backups and such can be left to the filesystem to
take care of 'under the covers' so to speak.
Transitive means that A mounts B, C mounts A and gets B free. Plan 9 does
this, managed by a set of authorization layers for fine control, native.
This means that when Hangar 18 goes online you can mount /hangar18 into
your filespace (via Plan 9 or Linux NFS services) and you will get all the
resources that Hangar 18 mounts through that point. ftp is a good example.
In Plan 9 you 'mount' the ftp server to your file system. If you ever go
out and walk that part of the file space tree and request a file it only
then goes and gets it. You can control its lifetime (to manage disk space
for example) via local cache controls. A 'lazy update' mechanism, very
efficient of network and local resources.
Irrelvant comparison.
You can build a journaled filesystem layer onto Plan 9 through scripts
that define how the various servers are supposed to journal the
individual compnents.
The network layer. The traffic between any two Plan 9 boxes is encrypted
with keys dependent upon the individual boxes (or larger classes if you
desire) if the system is so configured. You can also use this to encrypt
branches of your filesystem. Plan 9 provides SSH.
However the resource owner choses. I'm using 'small worlds network' models
for my 'web of trust'...
But the passwords don't go across the network, therefore they're not
'used' in the conventional sense.
It should be, X Windows sucks.
Another OS, intended for real-time control of "Internet Appliances". You
run it along side Plan 9.

 - Authored by same Bell-Labs crew that wrote Unix in the first place.
   Plan 9 was specifically designed to 'fix' the problems of Unix. It
   of course has its own problems. There is active support by the
   authors currently.
 - Has had many years of production use internal to Bell - Labs.
 - Open Source, no license required to build and distribute your own
   version.
 - Fully distributed in both process and file space
 - Has a unique three (3) kernel approach; I/O - Auth, File, Process
 - No 'root' user.
 - Supports IPv6 (default), IPv4, and IL (it's customer to Plan 9).
 - Filesystem is fully transitive, everything is treated like a file.
   This creates some unique opportunities to make publicly shared but
   privately maintaned resource pools. Hangar 18 is an attempt to do
   just this.
 - The filesystem is structured and featured in such a way that RDBMS
   sorts of solutions are moot. These functions are built into the
   filesystem itself (though not through SQL compliance).
 - Encryption (currently DES, needs fixing) built right in.
 - Doesn't use passwords, Instead it uses tickets (ie certificates).
 - Anonymity features with respect to both process and file space are
   not going to be hard to build in, Pike estimated at one points about
   150 lines of rc besides the actual crypto algorithm.
 - Global mobile log-in out of the box.
 - Has a wickedly new GUI.
 - Supports Inferno (run-time included) so that you can access one of the
   leading 'Internet Appliance' work environments. Plan 9 isn't real-time,
   but Inferno is. (It makes my Lego Mindstorm look like a directory tree,    makes programming real-time hardware operations rather easy)
Another Open Source OS to look at for inspiration is unununium. It is a
kernel-less OS, everything is a module that can be loaded in/out at
run time as required. Has some very interesting applications with respect
to distributed computing. There is a working implimentation available from
Source Forge.

No, they haven't. A disagreement of view is never in and of itself
justification for any physical act.
Why should you mind if these individual of a like mind decide they want to
re-negotiate their employment contract? Isn't that the 'free' in 'free
market'? The basis of free market economics is a give and take. The point
being that all parties are reasonably happy because they're reasonably
certain they got a fair and equitable deal. The fact the workers don't
feel that way is sufficient justification, in economic terms at least, for
their actions. The reality is that as much as some skin flint might like to keep paying 1920's salaries in 1970, the reality of the market doesn't
support those sorts of strategies. If the employer keeps too hard a line
nobody will work for him. If in fact the company can increase
productivity, lower costs, and increase profit why shouldn't the workers
reap some of that benefit. They are in reality as much a part of the
company, and fitting a share in the profits, as the 'board of diretors' or
the 'investors'.

You're probably wrong on both counts. When the US falls, it will likely be
from internal stress from external (and long running) events. We should
hope that the fall is as bloodless as the one in the CCCP back in very
early 90's. Note that people won't run from the cities, nor will there
likely be mass destruction (unless somebody in 'power' gets hard headed
and retains some sort of control over the military). In the case of the
CCCP not only had the society in general had their fill but so did the
military. The key point to a bloodless fall will be the military saying 'I
think we'll sit this one out, thank you very much.'

Ah, here is the double standard in your argument.
And what about the businesses that were used to support those British
soldiers. Would they have been legitimate targets (which they were to
the colonials)? In a parallel way the WTC is the business that supports
the oppressive forces, or at least that's the way they see it. Then of
course we can discuss the entire concept of 'property ownership',
'breaking contract' and 'repress colonials'.
This brings up the aspect of 'self determination' that folks like yourself
seem to be missing. Go read the first two para's of the DoI. Then reflect
on this;
The legitimate use of self-defence with respect to self-determination is
from the view of the oppressed. No consideration is made for those who one
fights against to end the oppression. Freedom is about the individual and
what they are justified in doing if provoked.
Now look at world politics since the 1850's...then consider certain
rejoinders by the founding fathers about getting involved in other peoples
business...then consider rampant globalization w/ centralized political
and military authority...
Further, you wish to us to view the WTC as a isolated senseless event,
when in fact it is not. It is only one more act in a 140 year refutation
of American Democracy.
We reap what we sow.

is old and some is new. It is intended to demonstrate that when the
Constitution as a whole is applied to sensitive issues it in fact provides
clear direction on the limits and character of the relation between the the
three arms of the government of the United States; federal, state, and
individual. I assume that anyone commenting on this document is giving their
explicit permission to include them with my replies unless otherwise noted.
I would prefer that all discussion take place on the Cypherpunks public
mailing list. I will submit all my responces to submissions to that list. If
you don't wish to discuss this issue in a public forum please do not respond
to me. I have no interest in private discussion on this topic.
This country is going through a crisis of civil liberties and a fundamental
loss of faith in the tenets of democracy. It is becoming more fascist (ie
public management of private property) on a daily basis. In the near future
it could become completely socialist (ie public management of public
property and elimination of private property) in the name of the greater
good. The belief that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or
the individual is in direct conflict with both the spirit and words of the
Constitution. Legislative, judicial, and executive branch decisions and
actions speak to this on a daily basis. One of the most controversial topics
is the private ownership of weapons and the duty of the government to
regulate the same. The current discussion on both sides is limited solely to
the 2nd Amendment. Unfortunately this is a stillborn position because it
misses fundamental issues and questions. To address those I have listed each
of the relevant sections of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Perusal
of these make it clear that the right of the individual to own and bear arms
with no interference or regulation is a fundamental right of every American.
This right is justified by a long history of abuse by political systems of
the individual as well as a continous sequence of physical assaults on the
It is worth making special note that the Presidential claim to executive
privilige regarding the use of military forces without Congressional
permission is unconstitutional (see Article II). The Constitution clearly
states the President is the commander in chief of the armed forces only
after they have been called into action. And only Congress may call them
into action unless it can not be conveined. The President of the United
States is not in the chain of command of the military forces without
specific authorization from Congress. Until such time as that is given only
Congress has the authority to direct and organize military activities. This
means that the President may direct military forces only until Congress
convenes. At that point Congress must decide whether to agree to commit the
Amendment 2, 4, & 9 provide in and of themselves sufficient grounds to find
any federal involvement in the purchase, possession, or operation of a
weapon to be unconstitutional. One of the most specious argumenst in this
discussion is that 'the people' in the 2nd Amendment is not to be construed
as meaning the individual. However, it is clear from the Constitution itself
and other amendments, such as the 4th, that this simply is not so. The term
'the people' means that the decision regarding such issues is to be made at
the level of the individual. In other words whether a particular individual
agrees to participate is completely voluntary.
                   THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES
   We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect
   union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the
   common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings
   of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish
   this Constitution for the United States of America.
[ Note that the intent of the Constitution, and by extension those who
  represent us, is to provide freedom of choice (i.e. liberty) for each
  individual (i.e. 'ourselves and our posterity'). This means that any
  claim that 'the people' does not refer to the individual and their
  right to make individual choices is specious and misdirected. ]
  Article I
   Section 8. The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes,
   duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the
   common defense and general welfare of the United States; but all
   duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United
   States;
   To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules
   concerning captures on land and water;
   To raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use
   shall be for a longer term than two years;
   To provide and maintain a navy;
   To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval
   forces;
   To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the
   union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;
[ Note it says 'the militia', not plural and definitely not state oriented
  since states are prohibited from raising or supporting troops. Note that
  it specificaly directs Congress and the President to use the Militia for
  internal issues only. ]
   To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and
   for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of
   the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the
   appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia
   according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;
[ This says Congress organizes, armes, and disciplines the militia - again
  nothing to do with the states and no implication of plurality. The only
  job the states have is appointing officers. One can argue over the wording
  of the training since it is ambigous. I interpet "..., reserving to the
  states repesctively, the appointment of the officers, .." as being a
  single clause and not carrying over to "... authority of training ...". ]
   No state shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty of
   tonnage, keep troops, or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any
   agreement or compact with another state, or with a foreign power, or
   engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as
   will not admit of delay.
[ This last paragraph is of special importance. It directs the states to
  provide for their self defence during times of truly imminent danger.
  There is also the implication of immediate responce. Yet the state can
  not keep troops or even collect taxes to this end. This also excludes the
  Militia since it is under federal control and can't be used by the states
  without federal consent. In other words they are not to base their responce
  solely on state or federal employees. The  implication is that each state is
  directed to provide for individual firearms ownership.
  It's also worth noting that if the US is actualy invaded and the federal
  forces are activated the states are still directed to raise forces
  independently of the federal forces, and these forces would be under
  state control and operated in parallel with federal forces. In addition
  this delegates the states to independant resistance even if the federal
  authorities surrender. It is a fundamental recognition of the states
  independence. [1] ]
  Article II
   Section 2. The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and
   Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states,
   when called into the actual service of the United States; he may
   require the opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in each of
   the executive departments, upon any subject relating to the duties of
   their respective offices, and he shall have power to grant reprieves
   and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of
   impeachment.
[ This last paragraph describes how the President takes control of the
  military. It is only after Congress agrees to release the authority.
  Normal day to day training and patrol duties are responsible to Congress
  only. ]
  Article IV
   Section 4. The United States shall guarantee to every state in this
   union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them
   against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the
   executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic
   violence.
[ Note this says that federal forces can not be employeed within a state
  without the explicit permission of the state government during periods of
  domestic violence. In other words "rioting in the streets" is not a
  sufficient condition for forced federal involvement through martial law.
  The state legislature is the prefered authority unless it can't be convened
  in time. In that case the state governor can make the decision but as soon as
  the state legislature is convened he's out of the picture. This means that
  states always have the option of refusing federal assisstance. This means the
  various forced tax and funds refusal threats of the federal government are
  unconstitutional. This means states have the option of opting out of any
  federal gun control regulations. ]
                             THE BILL OF RIGHTS
   The Conventions of a number of the States having, at the time of
   adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent
   misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and
   restrictive clauses should be added, and as extending the ground of
   public confidence in the Government will best insure the beneficent
   ends of its institution;
   Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
   States of America, in Congress assembled, two-thirds of both Houses
   concurring, that the following articles be proposed to the
   Legislatures of the several States, as amendments to the Constitution
   of the United States; all or any of which articles, when ratified by
   three-fourths of the said Legislatures, to be valid to all intents and
   purposes as part of the said Constitution, namely:
  Amendment II
   A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free
   state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be
   infringed.
[ This one really speaks for itself once you've understood the rest. They
  are actualy speaking of *two* seperate entities - the single federal
  Militia *and* the individual citizen. They are *not* one and the same. ]
  Amendment III
   No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without
   the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be
   prescribed by law.
  Amendment IV
   The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,
   and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
   violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,
   supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the
   place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
[ Our current society has a problem with what is understood to be
  'reasonable'. This is a strong indication that we need to create a new
  amendment to better describe the interface, expectations, and limits
  of actions regarding state representatives and the individual. The only
  other option is to eliminate laws respecting consensual crimes such as
  individual drug use, abortion, etc.
  Arguments based on 'community standard' are inherently broken. It implies
  the community has some homogenious standard, there is certainly no
  indication of authority to sample the populate with respect to this
  question. The religious and free speech and press clauses
  prohibit it. It further prohibits laws and acts respecting law
  enforcement based on statistical averages, profiles, mass searches,
  bumper stickers, public statements not inciteing something worse than
  domestic violence, etc. Note that this *does* give Congress the option of
  training the militia for operations involving nuclear, biological, or
  chemical attack for domestic use. (I believe that any such use must
  not allow weapons for other than personal defence to these federal
  forces. No tanks, bombs, missiles, etc.)
  You can't use an individuals beliefs as a basis for law. In that case, with
  no sample, the only question is would any citizen object to the
  behaviour? It is obvious the question must be answered in the negative
  since you have such an example at hand from the community. This effectively
  eliminates consensual crimes. If an activity does not cause physical harm
  to a person, their property, or a voluntary public trust it can't be made
  against the law at the federal level. (I don't believe a coersive public
  trust can exist under our Constitution. You can't punish a state or throw
  a citizen in jail because they object to participate in federal programs.) ]
  Amendment IX
   The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be
   construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
[ This one is really short and sweet. If anybody has a right then everybody
  has the right. There are no womens rights, gay rights, or minority rights;
  only human rights.
  This amendment prevents the government from even addressing what a persons
  rights are by the simple expedient that it prevents the federal or state
  government from even enumerating what they aren't. In other words unless
  the authority over some activity is proscribed in the Constitution the
  question of jurisdiction and decision are the individual states.
  It also means that the Supreme Court is prevented from using rulings that
  are of the enumerable type. In other words, simply because there isn't a
  directive in the Constitution is not sufficient reason to deny the
  individual the right of expression, or choice of execution. So arguments
  such as 'assissted suicide" isn't a right because there is no indication in
  the Constitution are specious and deny recognized fundamental individual
  rights in the 1st Amendment. So, in the case of gun control if there is a
  question at the federal level of jurisdiction (ie "What is meant by 'the
  people'?) the decision goes to the states and their individual constitutions.
  If it's not covererd in their individual constitutions then individuals in
  those states may make the decision on an individual basis. The Constitution
  is designed to fail-safe under questions of federal authority to the states
  or the individual. If Congress can't provide a delegate entry in the
  Constitution per the 10 th. it must suggest a constitutional amendment to
  the states. The current question of gun control has only two outcomes. Either
  individuals have their right to own guns recognized or the Congress and the
  state legislatures are required to mold an amendment to clarify the 2nd
  Amendment. The states can always stop federal aquisition of new
  authority at this point by simply refusing to put the amendment up for vote.
  At this point the states have a tacit admission of their supreme authority
  in such questions. ]
  Amendment X
   The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
   prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states
   respectively, or to the people.
[ This amendment severely limits what the federal level of authority covers.
  It requires the Congress to provide a delegate, one or more sentences,
  in the Constition for all laws (and I believe for all suggested bills as
  well). it further specifies that in questions of dispute the decision goes
  to the individual states and their republican governments (ie state
  constitution). If the indvidual states don't regulate the activity it is up
  to the individual to participate voluntarily.
  The United States of America is a balkanized collection if independant
  states who voluntarily give up limited authority to the federal level, they
  must explicitly agree to this to become a state. ]
The above document was submitted to the Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer, it
has been expanded since that time. As a result I received various replies.
My comments on the replies are included below along with quotes from the
replies to clarify context.
There was no intent not to keep the army going full-time. The intent was to
keep them from getting funding for long periods of time. In other words to
make it harder for them to build a long-term command structure and weapons
cache's (ie hide trusted soldiers away for rainy days). The army is intended
for repelling invasions and insurrections, how often do those happen and how
many last more than two years? If an actual invasion were to take place
martial law would be invoked and the budget limits would be irrelevant at that
But your point is true enough, and I was hoping somebody would bring this
aspect up. It has some interesting points that don't seem to have been
discussed. If you or others know of references I'd appreciate a vector.
If we accept this view (which I have no problem with, it'd be hard for a
Navy to invade Kansas - navies are self limiting) we are left with
joint-contracts that involve the army and navy are unconstitutional. The other
side would be that the navy must accept the more strict contractual limitations
imposed on the army by the Constitution (what I actualy prefer because of
new weapons systems). The intent is to keep the army on a short leash and to be
able to simply bypass this by working with other arms of the military would be
contrary to the Constitutions intent. One could transfer all the army soldiers
to navy command and impliment an oppressive regime that way. I don't believe
that was what was intended.
It also raises the fact that since the Army Air Corp was turned into the Air
Force (and this applies to the Navy and Marine Corp. as well) and no specific
guidance was made via constitutional amendment as to its budget constraints
it may be unconstitutional as currently implimented. Per the 10th there is
nothing that gives Congress the authority to create new military forces
outside of the army and navy. This should be done via a constitutional
What we have today is a joint command that integrates all the various
military forces under one umbrella. That joint command is an arm of the
executive branch and not Congress, that may be unconstitutional itself. This
raises the question of how seperate they are now and how congruent with the
Constitution it actualy is.
So, because of this the Joint Chiefs and the Pentagon may be unconstitutional
as currently implimented, or one could argue that all budgets must be limited
to 2 years. Since the Constitution requires such budgets to be reviewed from
time to time it implies that a full budget review of the military is required
every two years.
If you're a citizen of the US not only is it your place it's your duty.
To quote Jefferson:
The earth belonds to the living, not the dead.
The founding fathers wanted Americans to be free peoples pursuing their own
individual life, liberty, and happiness. It is the duty of all Americans to
protect those rights, even from other Americans. We have to decide the way
*we* want to live and the kind of world our children will inheret. The kind
of world our forefathers had and the decisions they made within that milieu
are good for exemplary review only. Santyana is a good guide. If nothing
else it is clear the fight is never over. No matter what we do our children
will have to fight it all over again on different ground and different
issues. We should at least give them a fighting chance.
I don't believe for a moment the founding fathers felt they had created a
once-and-for-all document. Nor do I believe they felt they were living at
the epitome of technical and social achievement within the total history of
mankind. Part of Jeffersons stock and trade was advancement, it's why he
created the University of Virginia. They knew they couldn't predict the future
and the best peoples to judge it were the ones living it. What they wanted
was a mechanism that would guarantee that the poeple had a say and were not
ruled over by a despot or tyranny. They hoped to give us a good chance at
reaching our individual and social goals, what those goals were are for us to
decide. We, not the founding fathers, have to live with them after all. They
were, if nothing else, simply trying to be good parents (both to a country
and to their biological children) and teach us basic principles.
I don't believe in the draft, it is coersion and is contrary to the tenets
of the Constitution. An army made of people who don't *want* to fight for
their country will lose. An army of peoples who will die rather than
surrender their liberty will always win, even if they are all killed they
deny the oppressor their goals.
One does not give up democracy to protect democracy.
This does point up one aspect of nuclear defence that has also seldome been
discussed, nuclear suicide. Instead of pointing weapons at other countries
one points the weapons (lot's of them) at oneself. If another country begins
a nuclear conflict (which is inherently unwinnable) the Earth as we know it
will become uninhabitable. Who wants to subject their peoples to the starvation
and other privations that will bring on. It is better to kill oneself
quickly and humanely and in that act poison the well so the enemy suffers at
their own hands and in the worst way. I believe we will never get rid of
nuclear weapons, and shouldn't, and this is the only sane way to control their
Actualy it's not the same thing at all. As to federalization of state
militia's. This should surprise no-one since states can't keep troops of any
form, even militia. The Constitution is also clear that there can be only
*one* militia and it is a national or federal militia. Even Mr. Denning
doesn't seem to catch the paradox because of his use of 'militias' in the
plural. It also misses the point that individual rights to own weapons is
*not* based on the requirement to have a militia. If the Constitution is
taken as a whole the right of the individual to own and bear arms is in
addition to both the federal military and militia. Also, his claim that
membership in the Militia is universal is faulty as well, membership is
voluntary but by no means mandatory as he implies.
There are a couple of issues with the current implimentation of the National
Guard as well. If it's the militia then there can't be 50 of them organized
by state. If they're not the militia then the state funding that goes
directly into them is unconstitutional. The reality is that at the federal
level there are three military forces; army, navy, and militia.
I am unaware of any assaults on federal gun control laws that use this line
of reasoning; states are required to protect themselves against invasion or
periods of domestic violence not dependant upon federal or even state
resources and that this authorizes private ownership of weapons. If you can
point to a summary of such a case I'd appreciate it.
I see the point he's making, I think it makes some assumptions that aren't
realy valid though.
At the federal level you have: army, navy, militia. All are managed by
Congress unless they hand authority to the President. In all cases the
funding and regulation comes from Congress. The states do get to appoint the
officers of the Militia however. I assume this is under the presumption that
such officers are more likely to refuse to follow federal orders if those
orders are clearly outside the line. It's a sort of checks and balances.
Now if we look at the section on states, that I claim gives the states the
responsibility to keep an indipendant force in time of invasion, there is no
stipulation as to who or how they are to be selected, organized, or funded;
other than it ain't federal or state doing it. One could argue that this
would then mean counties/parishes and then indipendant municipalities
before it gets to individual citizens, but that seems to beg the question in
my mind; not to mention they are not involved in the government of the US. It
can't be federal because there is no delegate that directs the Congress to
allocate funds for this use. It can't be the states doing the funding since
they are specificaly prohibited from doing this, without permission from
Congress, until an actual invasion or a situation that 'will not admit delay'.
This implies the sherrif and associated folks going from house to house asking
for help from the citizens as they see fit. Bubba and all his rowdies (those
that haven't been co-opted by the federal forces so far) along with Grandpa
and the two Jones' sisters ( :) ) getting in their pick-ups and going hunting.
It seems to me that it is the lower civil authorities deputizing the commen
citizen as a last ditch defence effort.
I think 'deputized citizen' is a more accurate term to describe the
participants of this last ditch effort to retain freedom.
As to the claim of militia or citizen soldiers not being effective, there
are plenty of bush wars going on right now that would argue contrary to
Using poetic license;
I suspect that if you got a squad of Texans chasing a group of non-US soldiers
out in the bush of Texas we'd have 'em for lunch. The same holds for just about
every other state as well. I can just imagine the results of a bunch of
Russians (for example) trying to chase Cajuns in the swamps of Louisiana. Or
American Indians in S. Dakota. They couldn't beat the Mujahadin and they
sure as hell won't beat us on our home turf. Compared to a Dog Soldier the
Mujahadin are amateurs.

i believe i said that ROI represented the total cost of the program to
eliminate some fraud  compared to the total amount of fraud. in the credit
card scenerio it isn't enuf to know the cost per event. assuming that
adding chips to those payment cards is a solution. in there US there are
something less than a billion new cards sent out each year ... and adding a
chip could cost on the order of $25 each. Just for the chips (ignoring for
the moment the issue of reader provisioning) ... that cost might be
somewhere in the $15b to $20b per annum range. There would have to be a
huge number of $3500 per fraud events eliminated by a comprehensive chip
program to justify it.
so as referenced in the previous postings .... advances in technology can
reduce the cost of dealing with fraud (in the chip card case ... it would
be nice to reduce it from $20b/annum to maybe under $1b/annum; say a
combination of significantly reduced chip costs as well as the number of
new sent out each year) while at the same time increasing the amount of
fraud (criminals find it easier to counterfiet existing cards increasing
the amount of traud that happens).
However, generically (except for some specific exceptions), the majority of
fraud has tended to be insider fraud. Just improving things with strong
authentication &/or identification doesn't directly address insider fraud,
significant audit, command & control, and compensating procedures are
needed to be in place to address significant amounts of insider fraud (who,
effectively by definition, have already been authenticated and identified).

the following from a thread on some of the fees related to fraud issues at
specifically from a thread on Visa/MasterCard Antitrust Comments.
Here's an interesting quote taken directly from Judge Barbara Nelson's
decision (the full text of the decision is available at:
"Defendants' ability to price discriminate also illustrates their market
Both Visa and MasterCard charge differing interchange fees based, in part,
on the degree to which a given merchant category needs to accept general
purpose cards.
Transactions with catalog and Internet merchants, for example, which rely
almost completely on general purpose cards, have higher interchange fees
than 'brick and mortar' merchants.
Defendants rationalize this difference by pointing to increased fraud in
these merchant categories, but this explanation is belied by the fact that
the Internet merchant, not Visa/MasterCard or their member banks, bears
virtually all the risk of loss from fraudulent transactions.
Even today, Amazon's fraud rate is lower than mail-order companies, yet it
is charged (indirectly, through the merchant discount) the same interchange
fee as these mail order companies.
The reality is that Visa and MasterCard are able to charge substantially
different prices for those hundreds of thousands of merchants who must take
credit cards at any price because their customers insist on using
those cards."

It appeared extreme to a minority of people then. The fact it happened

acceptable. Unfortunately this isn't an isolated case. They are not
kicking kids out of school for wearing 'anarchy' t-shirts and wanting to
form an 'anarchy club' in school. Both acceptable behaviour in America

Tim (and other C-A-C-L proponents) have opined that a 'business' has the
'right' to refuse service to anyone for any reason. This is clearly
contrary to both the concept of 'rights' and 'free market' (and is
diametricaly opposed to what C-A-C-L proponents claim(!) to want).
Things don't have rights. A business is a thing. It is a mechanism whereby
one or more people get from here to there. It is analgous to a bicycle and
moving from point A to point B. While the people riding the bike clearly
have a right to get from A to B by any mechanism that doesn't interfere
with others it is a long slide into insanity to then say the bike has
equivalent 'rights'.
A business can refuse to serve anyone they desire for any reason, but the
market such a business operates in is not(!!!) a free market by any
definition that folks like von Mises or Hayek would recognize as such. Now
C-A-C-L proponents claim (of which this is just another example of their
hypocrisy or ignorance - take your pick [1]) that they want to create a
free market that is universal in all human activity. Clearly this isn't
possible operating under Tim and his supporters particular brand of 'free'
which is nothing more than 'freedom for me, not for thee'. A business has
the RESPONSIBILITY to refuse service to anyone which threatens that
business' operations. They also have a responsibility to make that
reaction as minimaly invasive as possible in all cases, no exceptions.
There is no "..., but..." in free market or American democracy.
[1] Never ascribe to malice what can be attributed to incompetence.

No, you just don't want to admit you have no clue what Hayek was talking
Where it came from is irrelevant.
Hayek refutes it in Chapter 5 himself. Of course it doesn't apply to the
real world because you CAN'T create any of the three minimum conditions
necessary of a free market.
It's why Hayek also introduces the concept of 'imperfect competition'.
You didn't read (understand) Hayek, come on, admit it...
But Hayek draws a distinction, which damns your argument because you
ignore it, between 'competition' and 'information'.
No, it is related to Tim applying his bigotry. In a free market a seller
has a limited number of factors they may consider. Cost to manufacture,
cost at sale, difference in those prices and whether the market level is
enough to stay in business. It's also worth noting that in regard to 'free
market' the 'perfect information' is related to the product and the price
in the market, not the seller or buyers personal beliefs or actions
outside of the economic exchange.
Please provide a quote from Hayek to support your claim of his meaning.
Quid pro quo.

"According to the generally accepted view, perfect competition

2. Free entry into the market and absence of other restraints on the

somewhat as an aside .... the "gift" cards (and other flavors) that you see
at large percentage of retail check-out counters in the US are effectively
digital cash ... although the current incarnation results in a different
card at every retailer. however, they are online, magstripe-based digital
cash .... utilizing the same ubquituous point-of-sale infrastructure as
debit & credit (it is just that the transaction routing goes to different
online transaction processing than credit & debit). The issue of whether or
not it would be possible to use any card at any merchant is more of a
business rule issue than a technology issue.
note from a higher assurance standpoint ... the x9.59 work is applicable to
all electronic transactions .... whether they are credit, debit, e-check,
OR (online)  digital cash ... AND x9.59 transactions could flow over both
existing ubiquituous point-of-sale network and/or a ubiquituous internet
network (or any other kind of network).

A "local" financial branch implementation and a digital cash implementation
might have a number of similar useability attributes .... aka from the

BREAKING A QUANTUM SYMMETRY ON THE TABLETOP.
A recurrent theme in art and science, the concept of symmetry has
become a powerful scientific tool for the analysis of physical
systems.  However, under special circumstances, a "quantum
anomaly" occurs: the laws of quantum physics break a system's
apparent symmetry.  After a long search, a research group (Horacio
Camblong, University of San Francisco, camblong and
collaborators at Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina) has
found a relatively simple example of a quantum anomaly: the
interaction of a polar molecule with an electron.  A polar molecule,
despite being neutral, has a permanent separation of electric
charge--a dipole.  This dipole produces an electric field, which can
capture electrons if it is strong enough.  Can such an arrangement
exist as a stable ion, with its "extra" electron?  The researchers
formulated the answer to this question in the language of
symmetry.  In physics, symmetry means that a system, such as the
molecule-electron arrangement, behaves the same after you
perform a change to it, such as stretching the molecule to larger
scales and making appropriate adjustments to other variables in the
system.  At first glance, the electron-molecule interaction exhibits
a remarkable scale invariance: the system "looks" the same when
viewed from different scales in space and time--at least in a
classical physics description which treats the molecule as a dipole
and the electron as a point of charge.  But this tidy picture breaks
down with a proper treatment of the system, as prescribed by
quantum field theory.  A quantum field theory treatment requires
the process of renormalization, which removes certain
mathematical infinities and inconsistencies from the quantum
approach. This process also makes the molecule's energy levels
discrete or quantized rather than continuous.  Examining the
system this way, the researchers found that the scale invariance
broke down.  In fact, a large body of existing evidence, both
experimental and numerical, supports their conclusion.  While all
other known quantum anomalies occur at high energies (an
example is chiral symmetry in nuclear physics), the work suggests
that quantum symmetry breaking can occur at much lower
energies, in the domain of interacting electrons and molecules. (Camblong et al., Physical Review Letters, 26 November 2001.)

punk <> anarchy
'punk' actually means 'anti-establishment' and 'activist' in viewpoint.
anti-establishment/activist <> anarchy either.
The black leather and anarchy crap didn't 'happen' on the punk scene until
the late 70's and early 80's. In particular the club scene in England
(those crazy Brits and their unemployment, crank & horse).
When punk really took off (it began in the 60's w/ folks like Iggy Pop
and the Stooges) in the early 70's (New York Dolls, Germs, etc.) it was a
direct result of the crappy music (if only every Grease soundtrack would
self-implode...here's hoping). It was intended to be a return to the
'roots' of rock and roll and to attempt to escape from the large record
companies and their contracts. It fathered the current 'indy' music scene.
It's also interesting that this is when the 'industrial' music genre began
with bands like Throbbing Gristle (ie Genesis P. Orridge) and Einsturzende
Neubauten (Go Blixa!!! - You can't build without destroying). At one point
P. Orridge was looking to engineer/produce Suzie and the Banshee's first
album, Billy Idol told here to stay away from those crazies...

There is a difference between stating the basic principle and stating that
the principle is acted upon. Were the principle acted upon we wouldn't be
having these discussions in the first place.
We ALMOST ALL agree that the principles are not being followed. That in no
way detracts from the principles (eg very few follow the CACL philosophy
therefore it must not be 'true').

Not at all. You are still free to speak, just not on my property.
You have a right to engage in any behaviour until it infringes another.
You're trespassing infringes my property right. My not allowing you entry

That is certainly a good definition of 'commerce', it is not accurate for

goal in life. That he who collects the most is the best. That all things
can be reduced to a 'price'.
It is a faulty assumption and a warped view of humanity. As are yours.

Merry Christmas to you too.
The same key it shares with everyone else (all users to anon_1 use the
same key - bad!!! idea). Allows you to build up a big library of
plain-cypher pairs, and if you send it to yourself you can attack their
private key as well.
And it can't encrypt that outgoing traffic since it doesn't have the key
to the destination (I assume the user must nest these themselves). This
represents a lot of work for the initiator of a email, especially if
they're in a 'sensitive' situation. Too big a 'signature' (the traffic
analysis kind).
The sender having to know all the steps is a major threat to the standard
remailer model. In fact it's one of the major shorcomings with the current
approaches. The sender should at most be able to set the number of
remailers, not which ones. That way there's on evidence sitting around on
their machines (and you can posit throwing the keys away each time - but
then you have to go out and get them again...and around and around we go).
One of the primary points of any remailer technology should be to minimize
the threat to the user. This model doesn't.

If the sending node doesn't know about the destination node, how does it
konw where to send the traffic (even if the sender provides the address)?
The reality is that the remailers must 'know' of each other one way or
another. Simply being part of a 'remailer network' (anonymous or not)
tends to already put one in a 'conspiratorial' situation.
Truly robust remailers MUST be located in domains that protect speech and
association with something similar to 'innocent until proven innocent'.
That's the only defence against 'conspiracy'.

They also mis-report the cirumstances of the deaths as well.
So, if somebody was interested a little traffic analysis would take the
number reported 'over there' and then the number reported 'over here'
(irrespective of locations and such) and then begin to correlate them (a
lot of work and access to info that won't be easy to get, w/o an insider).

Actually they were. I can direct you to the plethora of 1st person
accounts during D-Day in Normandy for example. You will occassionaly run
across a reference of a recruit having gotten through boot and across the
big pond to only be turned back by an officer in combat. If a kid was found out, and the officers in their CoC gave a shit (some did, some didn't) they were returned home. It's a sad state that since the Civil War in this
country a considerable number of young kids have died in combat before
they were eligable for the draft.

Which is beside your point. Your statement was that the government didn't
do ANY identification for ANY of the soldiers in WWII. Patently wrong.
Quit trying to change the rules in the middle of the game.
AFTER the war started, not before. When the initial draft was executed it
was for 21-25 year old males only. They were required to register so that
the government knew who was getting drafted. That qualifies as
'identification' and is proof contrary to your assertion.

Status:  U
Reply-To: InfoSec News By James Middleton
The controversy, rumours and speculation surrounding the FBI's Magic
Lantern tool has attracted ridicule from the internet underground.
Not only has one virus writer constructed a piece of malware under the
same name, but now infamous hacker group the Cult of the Dead Cow
(cDc) has offered a helping hand to the Feds.
Evidently still grizzled about the fact that its notorious Back
Orifice 2K remote control tool was labelled as a malicious program,
the cDc is offering its expertise in the area to help the FBI build
what would be an almost identical tool.
Reid Fleming, a cDc member, said: "Never before has the US faced a
more troublesome enemy. To meet this growing challenge, the FBI has
announced an ongoing effort to create and deploy best-of-breed
electronic surveillance software.
"While we applaud the innovation and drive of the federal law
enforcement agency, those of us who are US citizens would be remiss if
we did not offer our expertise in this area."
A tongue in cheek announcement from the group claims that cDc "has
more targeted experience than anyone else in this field".
And they're right. Back Orifice would do the Magic Lantern job
beautifully. Although the hackers are quite confident that the FBI's
Engineering Research Facility is more than capable, cDc intends to
re-architect Back Orifice from the ground up.
"There will be absolutely no shared code between the two projects, in
order to skirt detection by commercial antivirus packages. The code
will remain totally secret. The software will never surface publicly.
And it will be far more stealthy than anything we have ever released,
demonstrated or publicly discussed," the group said.
Indeed, the central design principle of Magic Lantern and this new
breed of Back Orifice could easily be interpreted as "an artificial
witness which is capable of intercepting any and all relevant activity
during, after and even leading up to the commission of a computer
crime", it added.
The cDc concluded that the project would deliver "the ultimate
intelligence gathering tool. And we intend to construct it, at no
cost, exclusively for the use of the federal government," said
"We are confident that the government will limit the use of this
technology only to targets relevant to legitimate investigations," he
added, further underscoring the cult's faith in federal law
enforcement organisations. "The FBI has a long history of following
Title 18 to the letter."

Just checking. So you recognize a distinction between 'capitalism' and
'commerce' too...
And what makes you think capitalism isn't just that, a philosophy. In fact
'capitalism' is just like 'communism' or 'democracy', or even
anarcho-capitalism, in that respect. It's nothing more than the prioritization of goals and resources. It's distinction is that it posits
that by making lots of money all the other problems somehow take care of
themselves. "In the long run it'll all work out". Assuming of course there
is still anyone around...God $$$ Fascism is what Capitalism is.
"When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."

'Commerce' has two definitions. The first is involving the economic
exchange of goods and services. The second is any interchange between
individuals. It's worth noting the 1st definition can't exist without the
second, the contrary can't be said. It's hard to have a market if there
is no individual interaction, this implies of course one of two
conclusions. That 'economic commerce' and 'inter-personal' commerce are
either equivalent, or 'inter-personal' encompasses at least 'economic
commerce' (and I'm speaking from an axiomatic and algorithmic
perspective if that's not clear, not philosophical).
And this after all brings us right back to the original question.
"Does everything have a price or not?"

Actually the payment for the fee for the assayist and the mint aren't
likely to come out of the metal they are processing today. Now if we were
talking of a 'frontier' sort of situation then you wouldn't have those
fees going back into circulation, at least not immediately. In that case
the 'cut' would be collected over some suitable period of time and then
sold. Or the assayist could simply take their cut on the upstream broker
payment (this assumes of course they have sufficient liquid capital in
hand). But these examples, at least from the perspective of the money changer are
dealing with effectively 'unlimited' cash pools to draw from.

"Dot Con"
With Martin Smith
Producer/Filmmaker, "Frontline"
Friday, Jan. 25, 2002; 11 a.m. EST
When the Internet bubble burst in March 2000, unlucky investors watched more than $3 trillion of their money disappear. What spurred
the incredible dot-com bull run on Wall Street? Was the public blinded by dreams of small fortunes and easy living or did the nation
's investment banks manipulate the IPO market and exploit public trust?
For the past few months, the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association
of Securities Dealers have been investigating whether Wall Street investment bankers broke the law when doling out IPOs during the
tech-stock mania of 1998-2000.
BLAME GAME: It's early yet, but 2002 is shaping up to be a
good year for documentaries exhuming the dot-com corpse.
In addition to ``Wild At Start'' (
which made its broadcast debut on San Jose's KTEH-TV (Ch.
54) earlier this month, and ``e-dreams''
( a behind-the-scenes look at the
implosion of Kozmo.com, now comes the bluntly titled
```Dot Con,'' which premieres Thursday night at 10 on KQED
(Ch. 9).
The film, on which Wall Street Journal columnist Kara
Swisher consulted, tries to figure out just what happened
to the $3 trillion in stock-market gains that disappeared
after the bubble burst last spring. It pokes into
allegations that investment banks like Goldman Sachs and
Credit Suisse First Boston rigged the
initial-public-offering game.

@_subject: Diceware for picking Unix passwords (fwd) 
Prodded by comments about password cracking in another thread, I've added a table to my Diceware FAQ  for selecting random characters out of the ninety five printable symbols in 7-bit Ascii. The intent is to provide a practical and secure way to choose passwords as strong as Unix allows.
Below is what I've added. It's best viewed in a monospace font like courier. Comments are welcome.
Arnold Reinhold
How do I use dice to create random character strings?
To create passwords of maximum strength for a given number of characters, you must use all available symbols. This is especially important for most Unix systems where passwords are limited to eight characters from the 7-bit ASCII printable character set. In particular, Unix "root" passwords should always be constructed in this way! The following set of three tables allows you to create such a password.
Roll a die three times (or roll three dice) for each character and then select one of the following three tables, based on what the first die says:
If first roll=1 or 2             3 or 4             5 or 6
            Second Roll        Second Roll        Second Roll
          1  2  3  4  5  6   1  2  3  4  5  6   1  2  3  4  5  6
T  1     A  B  C  D  E  F   a  b  c  d  e  f   !  @  #  $  %  ^
h  2     G  H  I  J  K  L   g  h  i  j  k  l   &  *  (  )  -  =
i  3     M  N  O  P  Q  R   m  n  o  p  q  r   +  [  ]  {  }  \
r  4     S  T  U  V  W  X   s  t  u  v  w  x   |  ~  ;  :  '  "
d  5     Y  Z  0  1  2  3   y  z  ~  _  sp     <  >  /  ?  .  ,
    6     4  5  6  7  8  9
Note: Roll all three dice again whenever a blank appears in the table. The table entry "sp" means a space character. If you do not want spaces in you password, roll all three dice again.
Repeat this procedure eight times to get a maximal strength Unix password. Each random character adds 6.55 bits of entropy. Eight characters provides 52.4 bits of entropy.
224 T
131 C
553 }
215 Y
465 ,
334 u
326 roll again
535 /
364 x
The password is then:
       TC}Y,u/x
Easy to remember? Hardly, but it is the only type of password that provides full security on Unix systems. Only such passwords should be used for root and administrative accounts or high security user accounts. If security is less of a concern for user accounts, then eight characters from the first table can be used.

                           4:00 PM - 5:00 PM
In this talk we study the security of the widely-used RSA public key
cryptosystem.  RSA is used in the SSL protocol for security on the
Internet, and the SET protocol used by Visa for secure credit card
transactions.  This talk outlines several cryptanalytic results on the RSA
public key cryptosystem and variants.  We obtain our results using tools
from the theory of integer lattices.
We begin by introducing a novel algorithm for the factorization of a
class of integers related closely to RSA moduli, showing a new class
of integers can be efficiently factored.  We go on to introduce
new attacks on the RSA public key cryptosystem which take advantage of
partial knowledge of a user's secret key, showing that in low public
exponent RSA, leaking the quarter least significant bits of the secret key
is sufficient to compromise RSA.  Similar results (though not as strong)
hold for larger values of the public key.  Next we describe a new attack on
the RSA public key cryptosystem when a short secret exponent is used,
extending previous bounds for short secret exponent vulnerability.  Lastly,
we describe the Sun-Yang-Laih RSA key generation schemes, and introduce
attacks to break two out of three of these schemes.

The Atlantic's website ( as of today lists the

There is a discussion of DES being cracked a few years ago, and the
article also talks about one time pads, Enigma machines, the Scarfo case,
the Clipper chip, and reported al Qaeda stego use.  Definitely not a
technical article, but it is interesting to see how the mainstream press

Weakened encryption lays bare al-Qaeda files
17:07 17 January 02
Will Knight
Relatively weak encryption appears to have been used to protect files
recovered from two computers believed to have belonged to al-Qaeda
operatives in Afghanistan.
The files were found on a laptop and desktop computer bought by Wall Street
Journal reporters from looters in Kabul a few days after it was captured by
Northern Alliance forces on 13 November. The files provide information
about reconnaissance missions to Europe and the Middle East.
A report in the UK's Independent newspaper indicates that the encryption
used to protect these files had been significantly weakened by US export
restrictions that existed until last year.
The files were reportedly stored using Microsoft's Windows 2000 operating
system and protected from unauthorised access using the Encrypting File
System (EFS), which comes as standard on this platform. They were protected
with a 40-bit Data Encryption Standard (DES), according to the Independent
report. This was the maximum strength encryption allowed for export by US
law until March 2001. All systems are now sold with the standard 128-bit
key encryption, exponentially stronger than 40-bit.
Wall Street Journal reporters say that they decrypted a number of files
using "an array of high-powered computers" to try every possible
combination, or "key" in succession, a process that took five days.
Billions of keys
Brian Gladman, an ex-NATO encryption expert based in the UK, says that
40-bit DES means checking about a billion billion different keys in
succession. This would take the average desktop computer a year, but a
group of powerful machines could perform the feat in a few days, he says.
However, he adds: "If you go much beyond 40 bits it is outside the realm of
But Gladman says the US should not seek to reintroduce controls on the
export of strong encryption products in light of this evidence. He believes
that export controls would not necessarily stop terrorists and could harm
the security of companies outside the US.
"The internet is already vulnerable and if we do not implement strong
encryption, criminals will get away with murder," Gladman told New
Scientist. "Any efforts to prevent the deployment of this technology will
damage us rather than help."
Gladman says that terrorists can rely on far more elementary techniques to
keep information secret and communicate covertly. These include using
secret code words and anonymous internet cafes.

cryptography

Status:  U
Reply-To: InfoSec News By BOB BREWIN, DAN VERTON AND JENNIFER DISABATINO
January 14, 2002
As the airline industry scrambles to meet a Jan. 18 deadline to screen
every checked bag for explosives, security experts, analysts and
government officials are raising serious concerns about the security
of wireless technology that's integral to the effort.
At issue is the adoption by airlines of industry-standard 802.11b, or
WiFi, wireless LANs operating in the 2.4-GHz band. These systems,
which are widely viewed as inherently insecure, are being used to
support such applications as bag matching and curbside and
roving-agent check-in.
The concerns appear to be justified, based on two investigations that
were conducted last week by professional security firms that analyzed
airline wireless LAN systems at Denver International Airport and San
Jose International Airport.
The analysis in Denver was conducted Jan. 9 by White Hat Technologies
Inc., a Westminster, Colo.-based security firm. It revealed that
American Airlines Inc. operated wireless LANs totally in the clear
without any encryption in its portion of the DIA terminal.
The vulnerability of the American Airlines wireless LAN networks was
highlighted by the fact that the security specialists witnessed an
intrusion while conducting their monitoring. According to a report
furnished to Computerworld, security of the wireless LANs supporting
Fort Worth, Texas-based American's curbside check-in stands was
further compromised by the fact that the IP address of the curbside
terminal was prominently pasted on the monitor.
Except for an administrative network operated by the Denver
International Airport authority itself, none of the networks monitored
by the security specialists had turned on even the simplest form of
encryption: the 40-bit Wired Equivalent Privacy encryption algorithm.
Thubten Comerford, CEO of White Hat Technologies, said airlines that
operate unprotected 802.11b wireless networks "are putting themselves
and our nation's security at risk." Even when encryption is enabled,
wireless LANs "are a serious liability," Comerford added.
A scan of wireless networks at San Jose International Airport on Jan.
10 produced similar results. Jonas Luster, co-founder of D-fensive
Networks Inc. in Campbell, Calif., which conducted the analysis in San
Jose, said the wireless LANs there had few safeguards against
Luster said he was easily able to pick up signals and sensitive
network information emanating from the wireless LANs belonging to
American Airlines and Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. American's
curbside check-in operations could be monitored, Luster said, and
Southwest's networks were issuing information from back-end systems,
including at least three Unix servers running the Solaris operating
RIP Weakness
"In a matter of minutes, you could sniff out whatever you wanted,"
said Luster, who added that the routing infrastructure at both
airlines was open to exploitation. Routing Information Protocol (RIP),
a high-level language that transmits routing updates at regular
intervals, can be modified easily to assist a hacker, said Luster. "By
injecting a wrong RIP response, I could declare myself a legitimate,
authoritative, powerful node on the network," said Luster.
Although American acknowledged the vulnerability of the 802.11b
standard, it downplayed the seriousness of the situation.
"This particular issue is a very temporary one and a very
noncompromising one," said American CIO Monte Ford. American is
already on track to roll out a proprietary security system to replace
802.11b well before an industry-standard improvement is adopted, Ford
said. And he added that even if a hacker was able to locate passwords,
he would still be unable to access applications and databases. "A
password is not a free ticket to our network, by any stretch of the
imagination," he said. "They can just see points on the network. They
can't get into applications."
Ford said American doesn't plan to use positive bag matching to meet
the Jan. 18 deadline Congress has set for the airlines to implement
some means of screening all checked baggage. It does plan to start
using a bag-matching system later this year, Ford added.
American Airlines' visibility is at least partly attributable to the
fact that it has been ahead of the curve in wireless LAN deployment.
Delta Air Lines Inc., United Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines all
declined to comment for this story, citing security concerns.
Northwest Airlines Inc. and Continental Airlines Inc. didn't return
calls seeking comment by deadline. In any case, there appears to be no
coordinated effort among the airlines to address wireless security
For its part, American currently uses its wireless LANs only for
curbside check-in and roving agents, and Ford said that even if
intruders penetrated the network, they could do little damage. That's
because American's core systems are hosted by Fort Worth, Texas-based
Sabre Inc. on an IBM transaction processing facility (TPF) system
that's generally viewed as extremely difficult to hack because of the
rigid and arcane structure of TPF.
"It's not possible that you could get into the kinds of things that
could do damage," said Richard Eastman, an airline industry consultant
at Newport Beach, Calif.-based The Eastman Group.
The TPF-based reservation system is a deep matrix, with passwords
embedded in each level, explained Michael Anderson, director of
airport systems at Sabre.
But that doesn't satisfy Joe Weiss, vice president of the network
applications division at Annapolis, Md.-based Aeronautical Radio Inc.
(Arinc), a communications services provider owned by a consortium of
airlines. Weiss said he's concerned that a hacker could use an
unprotected wireless LAN to hop into core airline operational systems.
These systems include flight operations, bag matching and passenger
reservations. Flight operations systems manage such vital functions as
refueling, maintenance and flight dispatch, Weiss said.
Weiss expressed concern that access to a bag-matching system could
allow an attacker to manipulate the system to show that luggage
belonged to a boarded passenger when in fact it did not. This concern
is one reason Arinc plans to abandon the 802.11b-based bag-matching
system it operates as a shared resource system for all carriers with
international flights at San Francisco International Airport. Arinc
said it will switch to a private wireless system operating in the
800-MHz band. That system will be based on Integrated Digital Enhanced
Network (IDEN) voice and data terminals developed by Schaumburg,
Ill.-based Motorola Inc.
IDEN provides more robust security than wireless LANs, Weiss said,
including software keys for each terminal. Arinc plans to encrypt the
network traffic as well.
Presidential Concerns
The security weakness of wireless LANs used throughout the nation's
critical industries, including airlines, hasn't gone unnoticed at high
levels of the Bush administration. A senior White House official said
wireless security initiatives are at the top of the 2002 agenda for
the president's newly established Critical Infrastructure Protection
Board. At least one white paper is in development that will examine
wireless LANs and the interconnections between wireless devices and
critical infrastructure systems, such as Federal Aviation
Administration networks.
The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and two of its key
agenciesthe FAA and the newly formed Transportation Security Agency
(TSA)plan to take a critical look at wireless LAN security over the
next year. Mike Brown, director of information security at the FAA,
said that in this new security-conscious era, airline wireless systems
are subject to increased scrutiny.
The DOT has formed a "go team," led by Associate CIO Lisa Schlosser,
that will examine existing airline wireless systems, including LANs.
In partnership with the FAA, the TSA and private industry, it will
develop security standards and define a general wireless architecture,
Brown said.
Though American Airlines downplayed the vulnerability of its wireless
networks in San Jose and Denver, some security analysts viewed the
potential threat as significant and symptomatic of the airline
industry's failure to properly address network security.
James Foster, a senior consultant and researcher at Guardent Inc., a
security firm in Waltham, Mass., has conducted several wireless
security audits during the past year that have uncovered significant
vulnerabilities in and around major airport facilities, including John
F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Boston's Logan
International Airport.
"Possible baggage system vulnerabilities do not surprise me," said
Foster. "This is a serious problem that puts lives and the U.S.
infrastructure at risk."
Although he wouldn't provide details about specific airlines, Foster's
wireless security audits have shown that a skilled hacker with the
right software tools would need only seconds to conduct a detailed
reconnaissance of an airline's wireless network.
"Most of the time these [wireless systems] are tied to back-end
systems," Foster said. Regardless of how arcane or proprietary those
networks may be, "it's only a matter of time until somebody figures
out how it works, how it communicates and how people authenticate," he
said. "It would take no more than an hour to figure out how the system

Web Security Company Takes No Prisoners
By CHRISTINE BLANK
s a former airborne infantry officer in the Army, Clarence Briggs was
trained to protect the country from foreign enemies.
Now, he is using those specialized skills to protect his company, Advanced
Internet Technologies, from hackers, competitors and disgruntled employees.
Surrounding the company's property in Fayetteville, N.C., is coiled razor
wire atop a six-foot chain-link fence. The buildings have eight-inch- thick
concrete walls and are patrolled by uniformed guards with ready access to
firearms. Mr. Briggs explained that he did not want competitors to steal
server computers or data - something he said he had seen at other companies
that like his, serve as hosts for client's Web sites.
Mr. Briggs, who founded the privately held company six years ago along with
other former military people, has also installed video cameras, created
password access to secured areas, locked sensitive documents in a vault and
insisted on extensive employee background checks.
He said such measures were necessary to protect the 32,000 Web sites the
company operates for companies based in this country and abroad.
"Security must absolutely pervade an organization, especially an I.T.
organization," Mr. Briggs said, using an abbreviation for information
technology. "Most I.T. organizations don't even know how bad they get hurt
- until it's too late."
He says that the company, which is generally known as A.I.T., deals with
several attempted network hacker attacks a day.
Fortifications include A.I.T.'s custom-made firewall software, vigilant
surveillance by the staff - most of whom are military veterans with
extensive technical training.
"If I catch you, no expense is too great for me to come after you, and I
will make your life miserable," Mr. Briggs, a former major, said. The
A.I.T. team tracks down perpetrators, then either phones them or sends
representatives from the company or local law enforcement agencies to warn
against further attempts.
"We employ a lot of little traps to track folks that access our network,"
Mr. Briggs said. "We use the typical ambush techniques."
The company is so confident of its preparedness that it plans to offer a
security service for corporations this spring. The program, Mr. Briggs
said, will be modeled on A.I.T.'s mix of physical and electronic security,
along with a "rapid deployment team" that can be quickly dispatched to deal
with security breaches.

Recently I sent a note out describing some of the future changes that SSZ
would be going through. Well, one of those changes is here. In something
approaching two weeks the T1 will be installed and the various name servers
will be swapped over. As a result of propogation delay we expect 2-3 days of
service outage. We'll also be upgrading various systems as well during this
downtime. We apologize for any inconvenience and will try to minimize any
service outages.
Another change will be the elimination of all the SSZ mailing lists except
the Cypherpunks, Hangar 18, & Club Inferno. The rest will be moved over onto
the Open Forge machine or eliminated. Further info on this soon.
We are still undecided on which of the Open Source
code/document/media/project management packages we will end up with. If you have a distinct (dis)like for one or more of the current packages I'd appreciate hearing your reasoning.
The Hangar 18 Plan 9 file server should be online sometime in March. It will
be a single 80G namespace. We will then begin work on the processor farm.
Our current estimate is to have approximately 6-8 machines available
sometime late this summer.
We currently have one 802.11b AP active in N. Austin (near Target on 183).
Another node in Hyde Park (Duval & 48th) will be coming online in the near
term. They are NOT usually accessible at this time. These two nodes share the T1 by a dedicated ISDN connection. These are components of the Hangar 18 co-op
effort here in Austin. We are currently finalizing access policies and writing the web pages. Notices will be sent out on the Hangar 18 mailing list.

Agreed, assuming that something in the text itself wouldn't be
identifiable or traceable. In any sort of real world application such a
breach of security is considered incompetent.
Since most real world assume that something in the text itself is
incriminating (it's sort of axiomatic to the whole point of encrypting in
my mind) we can assume it is encrypted at the source, using the
destination keys. Then one takes the string of remailers that one wishes
to chain through in reverse order, encrypting each step along the way. So
that all that would be visible to any MINTM is a header with the next To:
and a block of encrypted text.
Agreed. It's the primary weakness (at least in my mind) of the current
approach, too few numbers by several orders of magnitude. I also think
that a major underestimation made by the vast majority is the actual
estimation of cost. When one considers that most real world examples will
have outside issues that will at least direct Mallet to one of the
participants. At that point it would not be that expensive to grab a
snapshot across some time window (say 24 hours) of the remailer network
given some sort of 'trigger'. The cost would probably be well within the
range organized crime, third world countries, and some of the wealtheir
individuals. It wouldn't be cheap but I doubt it would cost $1BUS for a 24
hour snapshot via black bag jobs (I'd be so bold as to say that a few
million might be enough if the planning and skillset are there).

Depends on what one is meaning by 'anonymous'. Context is quite important.
Can somebody go through their entire life completely anonymously? Not
likely. Email on the internet? Likely, if they are very careful and nobody
has any reason to suspect them of anything for some other reason.
It's a set theory sort of issue. Thinks like 'signature analysis' come in
handy. When people engage in ANY activity there is 'evidence' left behind.
The trick is to understand the (hopefully) distinctive differences in
different activities. Then one can 'measure' the sample at the site and
(supposedly within some delta of error) determine what did happen. The
only way to be truly anonymous would be to never leave any sort of
evidence. That's (at least for any practical intent or purpose)

Hiding Sensitive Data Can Be Tough in a Digital Age
By JOHN MARKOFF
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 13 - The modern task of successfully destroying
electronic documents has become daunting enough to give Oliver North
Mr. North is the Marine officer who became notorious during the Reagan-era
Iran-contra scandal after it was discovered he had tried to delete
thousands of e-mail messages, only to discover that they had been retained
on backup tapes and made available to Congressional investigators.
The issue of the destruction and possible retrieval of electronic data
burst into the news last week after Arthur Andersen & Company, the auditors
for the Enron Corporation (news/quote), said that the accounting firm had
destroyed a "significant but undetermined" number of documents relating to
Enron and its finances.
The embarrassing acknowledgment set off new demands from Congress that
Andersen produce a wide range of documents, including e-mail and other
computer files for investigators.
Today, Mr. North's efforts would be vastly more complicated because of
changing computer technologies and the emergence of the Internet, which has
ensured that there will be multiple copies of almost any electronic
"Today documents aren't just stored. They're sent," said Mark Rasch, a
former federal prosecutor who is vice president for cyberlaw at Predictive
Systems (news/quote), a network security consulting firm based in Herndon,
Va. Even though many companies have general procedural rules that require
the periodic deletion of e- mail, he noted, messages can usually be
"The sender and the recipient may have the message on their machine, in
addition to the server where it was stored," he said. "Unless there is a
tool used to remove it using military-grade technology, it can be
Most computer-literate office workers now realize that simply deleting an
e-mail message or moving a document onto the trash icon on their computer's
desktop screen does not eliminate the data.
That is because modern computers organize information by using file-system
directories that point to physical areas on a disk drive where the data
resides. "Deleting" the information usually only breaks the link between
the directory and the data so that the original storage space can be reused
in the future.
To eliminate important data, some companies and individuals use software
tools that try to "wipe" files from storage disks by writing random strings
of 1's and 0's over the space where the files were stored. Others will use
programs that "defragment" disks by moving information around on the
surface of the disk so that data can be retrieved more efficiently, which
can also write over old data. Or they can reformat the drives entirely.
What most computer users do not realize, however, is that the world of
computer forensics has made huge strides in recent years, and it is now
remarkably difficult to hide data from a determined investigator.
"Computer forensics is going to play an important role in recovering
documents in the Enron case," said John Patzakis, president and general
counsel of Guidance software, a company in Pasadena, Calif., that makes
hardware and software used by law enforcement authorities as well as the
Big Five accounting firms.
Every action taken by a computer user leaves a telltale trail, he said, so
the act of deleting documents can itself be revealing.
"Not only can computer forensic techniques recover documents, but they can
inform investigators when and how they were deleted," he said. "It is often
possible to determine if a deletion is an innocent act pursuant to a
corporate policy or if there is an ulterior motive." Even more remarkable,
technical means exist to retrieve data that has been erased.
It is possible to take a disk apart and use an electron microscope to read
information from the individual magnetic spots on the surface of a disk
that may have been intentionally erased, Mr. Patzakis said.
Originally a tool of the intelligence world, this technique - which is
costly - has been used successfully in big legal cases.

Another interesting question is whether the reporters and the Wall Street Journal have violated the DCMA's criminal provisions. The al Qaeda data was copyrighted (assuming Afghanistan signed one of the copyright conventions--they may not have), the encryption is arguably a "technological protection measure" and the breaking was done for financial gain.

Actually it isn't a math problem so much as a word game problem. Since you
postulate a drill of zero size it follows there can't be anything drilled
out and therefore cant' be any 'remaining part'. In fact, one could argue
that since you draw a clear distinction between pre- and post- drilling
(ie remaining) that this in fact excludes a drill of diameter 0.

at least one Aibo hacker of some repute broke the encryption and developed
tools. These compete directly with Sony's $500 Aibo development kit.

-- by Alan Friedman International Herald Tribune
Complete text at
NEW YORK Kofi Annan, secretary-general of the United Nations, will warn
international business and political leaders Monday that globalization risks a
devastating boomerang effect if the world's elite fail to increase spending to
battle poverty and disease in developing countries and act quickly to open up
markets in rich countries.
Using uncharacteristically strong language, the UN chief is expected to say that
the protests against globalization reflect the reality that power and wealth are
unequally shared and that more than 1 billion people live in extreme poverty and
degradation. Mr. Annan plans to bluntly point out that the anger rests on a
perception that globalization itself is to blame and that those driving the
process - the very same leaders attending the forum meetings - are responsible.
Horst Koehler, managing director of the International Monetary Fund and a
frequent target of the anti-globalization movement, emerged as another unusual
voice on behalf of a more equitable world. Mr. Koehler won applause from a forum
audience full of finance ministers and chief executives when he scolded rich
countries for failing to open their markets to exports from poor countries and
criticized U.S. agriculture subsidies that damage developing countries.
"Societies in the advanced countries are too selfish to give up their
privileges," Mr. Koehler told a weekend panel. "If we really want to make
globalization work for the benefit of all, then the advanced countries have to
realize it can no longer be business as usual."
Meanwhile, Mr. Koehler of the IMF issued a couple of highly unusual mea culpas
over the weekend.
"I think the IMF has to recognize that it has made mistakes, and in one or two
cases there was too much concentration on fiscal adjustments," Mr. Koehler told
the forum in an apparent reference to criticism that IMF austerity policies had
hurt some Asian and Latin American economies in the 1990s.
Mr. Koehler also made the surprising acknowledgment that while the IMF had in
the past insisted that emerging economies open their capital markets to
investment, "Today, I would never advise a country to open its capital market
without first having established internal regulatory institutions such as
banking supervision so they can cope with huge capital flows."

KENNETH LAY: "I brought a list, we certainly presented a list, and I
think that was by way of letter, I mean as I recall I signed a letter

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Chomsky blasts Forum from Brazil
BY ROBERT E. SULLIVAN © Earth Times News Service
Posted January 31, 2002
PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil - Noam Chomsky arrived here for the World Social
Forum (WSF) and immediately blasted the World Economic Forum (WEF) in
New York as power-hogging, anti-global, and linked to "crude and vulgar"
exploitation of the September 11 attacks. Chomsky, a linguistics professor
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a perennial leftist thorn
in the side of several US administrations, also told a partisan crowd of
some 250 journalists that the WEF theme "leadership in a fragile world"
could be translated to "maintaining our leadership and domination even
under conditions of uncertainty that we happen to face."
Chomsky will deliver the keynote address Friday at the second WSF, a
gathering of some 12,000 delegates and 60,000 activists from 150 countries
aimed at countering the business-led WEF in New York. Chomsky,
admittedly quoting liberally from his own Friday address and committing
"self plagiarism," told reporters who cheered as he arrived in the
municipal palace "One should be scrupulous in not defining the World
Social Forum as anti-globalization. There is no one who is
anti-globalization. This is certainly true of the workers and the left who
began their modern existence calling for an international movement."
"Every progressive movement, every popular movement has had this goal: to
create an international solidarity and an interaction. And that is
globalization, but in the interest of the population of the world. So, in
my view, this is a globalization forum. There is an anti-globalization
forum taking place in New York which is trying to prevent international
popular movements which will develop a form of globalization which will
help the population. They are actively involved in an institution designed
to preserve power. And they are involved in class warfare, and part of the
war is ideological warfare. And one element of ideological warfare is
stealing terminology and using it for your own purposes. They want
globalization to mean their particular form of corporate
anti-globalization. [Another element] is exploitation of crises in
order to try to silence adversaries in this class warfare. September 11 has
been exploited to that purpose. So their message is 'we, the powerful will
pursue our advantage more powerfully than before while you the people of the
world are supposed to be quiet and obedient and don't make any noise."
He added "There is no reason to be intimidated by this crude and vulgar
tactic. We can agree to be obedient and submissive and give the centers of
illegitimate power free reign to do whatever they want, or we can continue
programs and policies that were valid before."
Chomsky labeled the September 11 attacks an atrocity, but, citing the
European conquest of the Americas, said that the ruling powers were
"definitely familiar with atrocities of this nature."
"It is still an atrocity, but there are other atrocities, some under way
right now," he said, "but the difference now is that for the first time
the guns were pointed in the other direction."
"The rich and the powerful have tasted a small portion of what they have
done to others for centuries," he said.
Among the atrocities he said were underway now was what he called the
enslavement of 30 million people "and that is only if we use the technical
sense of slavery. If we use a more sensible measure, it would be in the
hundreds of millions of people," he said.
Chomsky said "The World Social Forum is really the first and most promising
realization of the traditional commitment of the left and the workers'
movements to an international forum with the interests of the people in

SPIRAL WAVES BREAK HEARTS.  Sudden cardiac death kills

SQUEEZING INFORMATION FROM ZIPPING PROGRAMS.
Data compression programs, such as the file zipping applications
found on many personal computers, provide an unusual means to
analyze information. Researchers at the La Sapienza University in
Rome (Emanuele Caglioti, caglioti 39-06-4991-
4972) have demonstrated how compression routines can accurately
identify the language, and even the author, of a document without
requiring anyone to bother reading the composition. The key to the
analysis is the measurement of the compression efficiency that a
program achieves when an unknown document is appended to
various reference documents.
      Zipping programs typically compress data by searching for
repeated strings of information in a file. The programs record a
single copy of the information and note the locations of subsequent
instances of the string. Unzipping a file consists of replacing various
bits of information at the locations recorded by the zipped file. Such file compression routines work better on long files because
programs are, in effect, learning about the type of information they
are encoding as they move  through the data. Add a page of Italian
text to an Italian document, and a zipping  program achieves good
efficiency because it finds words and phrases that appear earlier  in
the file. If, however, Italian text is appended to an English
document, the program is forced to learn a new language on the fly,
and compression efficiency is reduced.
       The researchers found that file compression analysis worked
well in identifying the language of files as short as twenty characters
in length, and could correctly sort books by author more than 93%
of the time.  Because subject matter often dictates vocabulary, a
program based on the analysis could automatically classify
documents by semantic content, leading to sophisticated search
engines. The technique also provides a rigorous method for various
linguistic applications, such as the study of the relationships
between different languages. Although they are currently focusing
on text files, the researchers note that their analysis should work
equally well for any information string, whether it records DNA
sequences, geological processes, medical data, or stock market
fluctuations. (D. Benedetto, E. Caglioti, and V. Loreto, Physical
Review Letters, 28 January 2002)

In my opinion it is possible to spend too much time reading others works
and not enough time thinking about them and ones own views. The reality
is that if a single one of these papers had any real application to the
real world problems they'd stand out light a nova in a eclipse.
Unfortunately they don't, and probably won't since the sorts of research
and dialog (and I use that term loosely) is limited.
One would do better, for themselves and society, if they were to read to
the point they think they understand the problem and then quit reading and
start modelling. The solution(s) will not only be unexpected but they will
come from unexpected sources.

Status:  U

Hi, Debian has recently received legal advice explaining how we can
include software with cryptographic functionality in our main archive.
This document can be found at
. In accordance with this
advice we plan to include cryptographic software in our main archive (at
some point after March 8th).  This will allow us to integrate security
software such as OpenSSH, SSL support, and many other enhancements into
our operating system. Since you are mirroring the Debian distribution you
may be wondering what impact, if any, this will have on you. Obviously you
will notice the new software entering the main archive.  If you mirror
non-US, you also may notice some software dropped from the non-US
distribution as it moves into main.  The primary concern however is likely
to be legal impact.  For mirrors outside the United States there should be
no new legal issues not present for those already mirroring non-US (and
accordingly the rest of the mail isn't relevant to you). The software in
Debian's main archive is all publicly available in the sense of section
740.13(e) of the US EAR.  This means that it can be exported from the
United States if Debian files export notification at the time of export.
According to the legal advice Debian received, mirrors do not need to send
in their own notifications.  Debian will send in a notification that
covers our master archive and any mirrors of that archive.  We will also
update this notification as we add software. BXA regulations require that
you not knowingly export to embargoed countries, as a show of good faith
you may wish to consider implementing a reverse IP lookup that identifies
the computer requesting the download, and that blocks downloads of the
cryptographic archive to countries embargoed by the United States: Cuba
(.cu), Iran (.ir), Iraq (.iq), Libya (.ly), North Korea (.kp), Syria
(.sy), Sudan (.sd) and Taliban Occupied Afghanistan.  In addition, you
might consider having a separate screen prior to download, that advises
the person downloading the software as follows:
   This software is subject to U.S. export controls applicable to open
   source software that includes encryption.  Debian has filed the
   notification with the Bureau of Export Administration and the
   National Security Agency that is required prior to export under the
   provisions of License Exception TSU of the U.S. Export
   Administration Regulations.  Consistent with the requirements of
   License Exception TSU, you represent and warrant that you are
   eligible to receive this software, that you are not located in a
   country subject to embargo by the United States, and that you will
   not use the software directly or indirectly in the design,
   development, stockpiling or use of nuclear, chemical or biological
   weapons or missiles.  Compiled binary code that is given away free
   of charge may be re-exported under the provisions of License
   Exception TSU.  However, additional technical review and other
   requirements may apply to commercial products incorporating this
   code, prior to export from the United States.  For additional
   information, please refer to  If you have any questions
about this new policy, please let us know. NB: I am not a lawyer and this
mail is not legal advice. --

[Warning to humor/lexicaly impaired: Use of third person 'you' below]
So are most hard systems also :)
The real answer is -participation- coupled with the right (and a system
to back it up) to say "No, thank you. But, I don't believe I want to
play." And have it respected. If one of the existing nodes isn't
providing a particular services, and you really truly believe there is a
market for that service; why are you still sitting on your butt? It is not
expensive, nor does it take large amounts of ones time. Start a node and
impliment whatever sort of reputation/content filtering floats your boat.
Nothing stops you from filtering the traffic to YOUR node any way you see
fit. The system is intended to PROMOTE that exact behaviour.
Why do you want somebody else to make the decision for you?
As has been explained many times before; NONE of these mechanisms are in
and of themselves outside the charter of the CDR. The only stipulation is
that the outbound traffic from each node is NOT modified or filtered in
any way by OTHER nodes, and gets passed to all nodes via the backbone. I
may have no intention of putting my reading material under your thumb, but
I'm willing to invest a feed to see how it comes out... I love
experiments, they trump 'theory' every time!
What is problematic with the proposals from the CACL contingent is that
they desire to require ALL nodes to operate under one set of rules. Their
justification is that their feelings are hurt, and those of us who don't
respond appropriately are being mean. The 'friction' is it isn't their
marbles so they got nothing to take home...
Now ask yourself this, if they don't believe enough in their philosophy to
operate by it on a mailing list, what does that portend for 'real life'?
People are people, people are strange; technology has nothing to do with
that. Another example of why CACL theory fails. Technology neither creates
or solves problems, they satisfy (or not) human desire. There will always
be friction between human desires...

A principle component of which was legalized murder. The stipulation was
you couldn't run from the act, hide the fact you had done the act, and you
had to tell the first n people you met what you had done. This obsolved
you from consequence and even prohibited the family of the murdered from
seeking revenge.
It's also worth noting that Denmark and several other countries that came
to visit to determine if they wanted to try it all turned it down.
Further, there was no WRITTEN public law. The law makers gathered at least
once a year and set down and gossiped...so to speak. There was a
centralized heirarchy and a common cultural expectation.
I'd be so bold as to venture the primary reason this system was stable had
more to do with the time to travel between realms versus the size of
realms. This set a limit to the complexity of the society (ie it's social institutions and their costs versus the resources available). It was a
critical point.
One of the primary complaints against CACL based philosophy is the fact
that it WILL revert to violence despite claims to the contrary. It isn't a
question of government infecting society, man is a heirarchical social
animal. People have expectations, other people have different ones.
Sometimes these expectations are contrary and irresolvable without force.
That isn't a function of government, that is a function of psychology;
human psychology. One function of (non-tyrannical) government is to
promote a stable social and economic environment. This implies some
mechanism to manage conflict, especially violent conflict. The primary
problems here are authority, responsibility, and accountability.

That's not correct. There are lots of albums (aimed at DJ's for example)
that are -NEVER- available except on vinyl. Also, if you'll actually check
the 'yellow book' at your record store you'll find that over the last 4-5
years a growing number of albums are available on CD only; no LP, no
cassette. Start in the techno and related genre. Hint, they are -not- hit
HDTV will come. That you can take to the bank. BUT, that doesn't equate to
the end of NTSC by about 10 to 15 years.
