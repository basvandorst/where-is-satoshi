I can't help but wonder who would send money to same random person based on
a story that may or may not be true. Were these people sucked in by Nigeria
scams as well?
Not only that, but the list of people who proclaimed their innocence only
to be proven guilty is very long. I can't vouch for countries outside of
the USA, but here at least we don't get subpoenas on a whim. They are
usually part of a very long drawn-out investigation, and they usually are
for a very good reason.
