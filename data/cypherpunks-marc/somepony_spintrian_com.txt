I just this evening signed up for a google mail account using only the vanilla Tor browser and a random node.
I used a 10 minute email to verify the email account, I was a little surprised it got past google as a valid email domain.  Google did send an email and I used the link, no phone number necessary.
Perhaps your IP was showing from a country google restricts?  I just signed in with my account to verify (incidentally I cannot leave YouTube comments for some reason)
Try again?

My question is, if you NEVER requested the 1 web page in the first place, would you have experienced the same attack?  I mean if I were looking for new live Tor services I would probably periodically just roll through unknown IPs and check for a live node (or something) as one layer of attack.  No live node, move on.  Live node not already discovered?  The fact that the node responds (in some manner I'm looking for) is enough information, it's possible I don't even care that it has anything to do with Tor.
Just a thought, it should be clear I have no idea what I'm talking about. e.g. I don't know what your middleman server not getting attacked tor-talk mailing list
