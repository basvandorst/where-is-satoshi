A P Drop me: A police officer pulls over this guy who's been weaving in and out of the
lanes. He goes up to the guy's window and says, "Sir, I need you to blow
into this breathalyzer tube." The man says, "Sorry, officer, I can't do
that. I am an asthmatic. If I do that, I'll have a really bad asthma
attack." "Okay, fine. I need you to come down to the station to give a blood
sample." "I can't do that either. I am a hemophiliac. If I do that, I'll
bleed to death." "Well, then, we need a urine sample." "I'm sorry, officer,
I can't do that either. I am also a diabetic. If I do that, I'll get really
low blood sugar." "All right, then I need you to come out here and walk this
white line." "I can't do that, officer." "Why not?" "Because I'm drunk."
Al Smith was governor of New York State. He was a famouse man. he was born
very poor on the East Side of New York City. he had little education. He
worked very hard and won great success.One day, as governor, he was visiting
the state prison at Sing Sing. Sing Sing is one of the largest prisons in
the United States. The head of the prison asked Mr. Smith to say something
to the prisoners. Mr. Smith had never spoken to this kind of audience
before. He did not know how to begin.Finally, he said, "My fellow
citizens..." Then he remembered that when a man goes to prison he is no
longer a citizen. he began again. "My fellow prisoners..." That did not
sound right, so he said: "Well, anyway, I'm glad to see so many of you here
