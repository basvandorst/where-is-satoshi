In light of the fact that Telcordia is a wholly-owned subsidary
of SAIC, this is especially troublesome.
"Some of the nation's most influential former military
and intelligence officials have been informed in recent
days that they are at risk of identity theft after a
break-in at a major government contractor netted computers
containing the Social Security numbers and other personal
information about tens of thousands of past and present
company employees."

What? You think it hasn't already happened?
It has -- unscrupulous bot masters have already used the Tor network
in attempts to cloak their activities.
The main concern here should be how to prohibit it from happening
in the future, or at least detect it/deal with it -- or else the
entire Tor infrastructure will be threatened from forces larger tha
you can imagine.
