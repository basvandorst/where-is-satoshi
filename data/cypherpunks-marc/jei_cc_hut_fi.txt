Terrorist attacks in US - Intelligence memo points to Mossad link
Shahid Ahmed Qureshi
Frontier Post, Pakistan
Updated on 9/16/2001 12:15:20 PM
LONDON: A US military intelligence source revealed details of an internal
intelligence memo that points to the Israeli Mossad intelligence service
having links to the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks.
The intelligence source, who requested his name be withheld, confirmed the
internal US intelligence memo circulated four weeks ago described
information that pointed to the threat of a covert Israeli operation on US
soil to turn mass public opinion against Palestinian Arabs via an apparent
terrorist attack on US interests that would give Israel the green light to
implement a large scale military onslaught against the Palestinian Arab
The 11 September attack has been described by experts as being too
sophisticated for a lone terrorist group to execute.
"This attack required a high level of military precision and the resources
of an advanced intelligence agency.
In addition, the attackers would have needed to be extremely familiar with
both air force one flight operations, civil airline flight paths and aerial
assault tactics on sensitive US cities like Washington, Stated David Stern
an expert on Israeli intelligence operations.
The attacks targeted the Pentagon, World Trade Center towers, with the White
House and air force also being targets according to the FBI.
"The attacks have certainly turned US public opinion firmly back in Israel's
favour after 11 months of Palestinian uprising, heavy criticism of Israel
over war crimes allegations and racism by a UN conference in Durban.
The attacks serve no Arab group or nation's interests but their timing came
in the midst of international condemnation of Israel for its policy of death
squad assassination of Palestinian political and police figures", added
If verified, the news of Israel's involvement in the US attack welcome as no
surprise to intelligence experts.
The state of Israel has a long history of covert operations against Western
targets with attacks on the King David Hotel, USS Liberty, murder of a
Scandinavian UN envoy as well as espionage against the US during the
Jonathan Pollard case.
On Wednesday the US defence Department issued a warning to its officials to
halt the leak of information on the investigation which it says is happening
on a daily basis since the attacks occurred.

Rational Fanatics
(This article was originally published in the September/October 2000 issue of Foreign Policy. )
What makes suicide bombers tick? While most of the world sees them as lone
zealots, they are, in fact, pawns of large terrorist networks that wage
calculated psychological warfare. Contrary to popular belief, suicide
bombers can be stopped-but only if governments pay more attention to their
methods and motivations.
By Ehud Sprinzak
October 23, 1983, was one of the most horrific days in the history of
modern terrorism. Two massive explosions destroyed the barracks of the U.S.
and French contingents of the multinational peacekeeping force in Beirut,
Lebanon, killing 241 American servicemen and 58 French paratroopers. Both
explosions were carried out by Muslim extremists who drove to the heart of
the target area and detonated bombs with no intention of escaping.
Subsequent suicide attacks against Israeli and U.S. targets in Lebanon and
Kuwait made it clear that a new type of killing had entered the repertoire
of modern terrorism: a suicide operation in which the success of the attack
depends on the death of the perpetrator.
This tactic stunned security experts. Two centuries of experience suggested
that terrorists, though ready to risk their lives, wished to live after the
terrorist act in order to benefit from its accomplishments. But this new
terrorism defied that belief. It seemed qualitatively different, appearing
almost supernatural, extremely lethal, and impossible to stop. Within six
months, French and U.S. Presidents François Mitterrand and Ronald Reagan
pulled their troops out of Lebanon-a tacit admission that the new terrorism
rendered all known counterterrorist measures useless. Government officials
erected concrete barriers around the White House and sealed the Pentagon's
underground bus tunnels. Nobody was reassured. As Time magazine skeptically
observed in 1983: "No security expert thinks such defensive measures will
stop a determined Islamic terrorist who expects to join Allah by killing
some Americans."
Whereas the press lost no time in labeling these bombers irrational
zealots, terrorism specialists offered a more nuanced appraisal, arguing
that suicide terrorism has inherent tactical advantages over "conventional"
terrorism: It is a simple and low-cost operation (requiring no escape
routes or complicated rescue operations); it guarantees mass casualties and
extensive damage (since the suicide bomber can choose the exact time,
location, and circumstances of the attack); there is no fear that
interrogated terrorists will surrender important information (because their
deaths are certain); and it has an immense impact on the public and the
media (due to the overwhelming sense of helplessness). Dr. Ramadan Shalah,
secretary- general of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, summarized the
chilling logic of the new terror tactic: "Our enemy possesses the most
sophisticated weapons in the world and its army is trained to a very high
standard. . . . We have nothing with which to repel killing and thuggery
against us except the weapon of martyrdom. It is easy and costs us only our
lives. . . human bombs cannot be defeated, not even by nuclear bombs."
The prevalence of suicide terrorism during the last two decades testifies
to its gruesome effectiveness [see table on opposite page]. It has formed a
vital part of several terror campaigns, including Hezbollah's successful
operation against the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the mid-1980s, the
1994-96 Hamas bus bombings aimed at stopping the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process, and the 1995-99 Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) struggle against
Turkey. The formation of special suicide units within the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) army in Sri Lanka has added an atrocious dimension to
the civil war on that devastated island. In addition to killing hundreds of
civilians, soldiers, and high-ranking officers since 1987, LTTE suicide
terrorists have assassinated two heads of state: Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi of India in 1991 and President Ranasinghe Premadasa of Sri Lanka in
1993. Sri Lanka's current president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, recently lost
sight in one eye following an assassination attempt that killed at least 24
people. The simultaneous 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, which took the lives of nearly 300 civilians, were a brutal
reprise of the 1983 tragedies in Lebanon.
Almost 20 years after its stunning modern debut, suicide terrorism
continues to carry the image of the "ultimate" terror weapon. But is this
tactic as unstoppable as it seems? The experiences of the last two decades
have yielded important insights into the true nature of suicide
bombers-insights that demystify their motivations and strategies, expose
their vulnerabilities, and suggest ways to defeat what a senior State
Department official once called a "frightening" problem to which there are
"no answers."
Average, Everyday Martyrs
A long view of history reveals that suicide terrorism existed many years
before "truck bombs" became part of the global vernacular. As early as the
11th century, the Assassins, Muslim fighters living in northern Persia,
adopted suicide terrorism as a strategy to advance the cause of Islam. In
the 18th century the Muslim communities of the Malabar Coast in India,
Atjeh in Sumatra, and Mindanao and Sulu in the southern Philippines
resorted to suicide attacks when faced with European colonial repression.
These perpetrators never perceived their deaths as suicide. Rather, they
saw them as acts of martyrdom in the name of the community and for the
glory of God.
Moreover, suicide terrorism, both ancient and modern, is not merely the
product of religious fervor, Islamic or otherwise. Martha Crenshaw, a
leading terrorism scholar at Wesleyan University, argues that the mind-set
of a suicide bomber is no different from those of Tibetan self-immolators,
Irish political prisoners ready to die in a hunger strike, or dedicated
terrorists worldwide who wish to live after an operation but know their
chances of survival are negligible. Seen in this light, suicide terrorism
loses its demonic uniqueness. It is merely one type of martyrdom venerated
by certain cultures or religious traditions but rejected by others who
favor different modes of supreme sacrifice.
Acts of martyrdom vary not only by culture, but also by specific
circumstances. Tel Aviv University psychologist Ariel Merari has conducted
the most comprehensive study of individuals who commit acts of suicide
terrorism. After profiling more than 50 Muslim suicide bombers serving in
Hezbollah, Amal, and secular pro-Syrian organizations in Lebanon, as well
as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Israel, he concluded that
there is no single psychological or demographic profile of suicide
terrorists. His findings suggest that intense struggles produce several
types of people with the potential willingness to sacrifice themselves for
a cause [see sidebar on page 70]. Furthermore, Merari maintains that no
organization can create a person's basic readiness to die. The task of
recruiters is not to produce but rather to identify this predisposition in
candidates and reinforce it. Recruiters will often exploit religious
beliefs when indoctrinating would-be bombers, using their subjects' faith
in a reward in paradise to strengthen and solidify preexisting sacrificial
motives. But other powerful motives reinforce tendencies toward martyrdom,
including patriotism, hatred of the enemy, and a profound sense of
Since suicide terrorism is an organizational phenomenon, the struggle
against it cannot be conducted on an individual level. Although profiling
suicide bombers may be a fascinating academic challenge, it is less
relevant in the real-world struggle against them than understanding the
modus operandi and mind-set of terrorist leaders who would never consider
killing themselves, but opt for suicide terrorism as a result of cold
The Care and Feeding
of a Suicide Bomber
A suicide terrorist is almost always the last link in a long organizational
chain that involves numerous actors. Once the decision to launch a suicide
attack has been made, its implementation requires at least six separate
operations: target selection, intelligence gathering, recruitment, physical
and "spiritual" training, preparation of explosives, and transportation of
the suicide bombers to the target area. Such a mission often involves
dozens of terrorists and accomplices who have no intention of committing
suicide, but without whom no suicide operation could take place.
A careful survey of all the organizations that have resorted to suicide
terrorism since 1983 suggests that the most meaningful distinction among
them involves the degree to which suicide bombing is institutionalized. At
the simplest level are groups that neither practice suicide terrorism on a
regular basis nor approve of its use as a tactic. Local members or
affiliates of such organizations, however, may initiate it on their own for
a variety of reasons, such as imitating the glorious acts of others,
responding to a perception of enormous humiliation and distress, avenging
the murder of comrades and relatives, or being presented with a special
opportunity to strike.
Within such a context, it is important to take into account what might be
called "pre-suicide terrorism." Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad suicide
operations in Israel during the 1990s were preceded by a wave of knifings
in the late 1980s. These attackers never planned an escape route and were
often killed on the spot. The knifings did not involve any known
organization and were mostly spontaneous. But they expressed a collective
mood among young Palestinians of jihad (holy war) against Israel that
helped create an atmosphere for the institutionalized suicide terrorism of
the next decade.
Many terrorist groups are skeptical of suicide terrorism's strategic value
but resort to this tactic in exceptional circumstances. Within this
category are the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
(allegedly executed by Osama bin Laden's Qaida organization) and similar
irregular attacks conducted over the years by the Egyptian Islamic Group,
the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the Kuwaiti Dawa, and the Algerian Armed
Islamic Group, among others. Such suicide bombings, though carefully
planned, are irregular and unsystematic.
At another level are groups that formally adopt suicide terrorism as a
temporary strategy. The leaders of these movements obtain (or grant)
ideological or theological legitimization for its use, recruit and train
volunteers, and then send them into action with a specific objective in
mind. The most spectacular operations of Hezbollah between 1983 and 1985,
of Hamas between 1994 and 1996, and of the PKK between 1995 and 1999 fall
within this category. More recently, Chechen rebels suddenly launched a
campaign of suicide bombings following nine months of inconclusive fighting
against the Russian military; one of the first bombers, a cousin of noted
rebel leader Arbi Barayev, had reportedly declared: "I am going willingly
to my death in the name of Allah and the freedom of the Chechen people."
In such cases, the institutionalization of suicide terrorism has been
temporary and conditional. Leaders who opt for this type of terrorism are
usually moved by an intense sense of crisis, a conviction in the
effectiveness of this new tactic, endorsement by the religious or
ideological establishment, and the enthusiastic support of their community.
At the same time, they are fully aware of the changeable nature of these
conditions and of the potential costs associated with suicide terrorism
(such as devastating military retaliation). They consequently have little
difficulty in suspending suicide bombing or calling it off entirely.
A case in point is Hezbollah's decision to begin suicide bombings in 1983.
It is known today that several leaders of the organization were extremely
uneasy about the practice. Insisting that Islam does not approve of
believers taking their own lives, clerics such as Sheikh Fadlallah raised
legal objections and were unwilling to allow the use of this new tactic.
However, suicide terrorism became so effective in driving foreigners out of
Lebanon that there was no motivation to stop it. The result was theological
hair splitting that characterized suicide bombers as exceptional soldiers
who risked their lives in a holy war. But following the Israeli withdrawal
from Lebanon in 1985 and the decreasing effectiveness of this tactic,
Hezbollah's clerics ordered the end of systematic suicide bombing. The
organization's fighters were instructed to protect their lives and continue
the struggle against the Zionists through conventional guerrilla methods.
Only rarely, and on an irregular basis, has Hezbollah allowed suicide
bombing since.
It is not exactly clear when the commanders of Hamas decided to turn their
anti-Israel suicide attacks into a strategic struggle against the peace
process. Their campaign, started haphazardly in 1992 against Israeli
military and settler targets in the occupied territories, failed to produce
glaring results. The 1994 Hebron Massacre, when Israeli doctor Baruch
Goldstein murdered 29 praying Palestinians, changed everything. Determined
to avenge the deaths of their countrymen, Hamas operators resorted to
suicide bus bombings inside Israeli cities. In a matter of weeks, the new
wave of terrorism had eroded Israel's collective confidence in the peace
process and had played right into the hands of extremist Hamas clerics who
opposed negotiations with Israel. Yet, in 1995 these attacks suddenly came
to a complete halt. Several factors convinced Hamas leaders to back off:
the growing Palestinian resentment against the costs of the bus bombings
(expressed in massive Israeli economic sanctions), the increasing
cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian security services, and the
effectiveness of Israeli counterterrorism.
Ironically, Israel unintentionally pushed the organization to resume the
bus bombings when, in 1996, then Prime Minister Shimon Peres ordered the
assassination of Yehiya Ayash (known as "the Engineer") -a Hamas operative
who masterminded many of the previous suicide bombings. Humiliated and
angered, Hamas temporarily resumed bus bombings in Israel. A series of
three successful attacks by Hamas and one by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad
changed Israel's political mood about the peace process and led to the 1996
electoral defeat of Peres and his pro-peace government.
In the cases of Hezbollah and Hamas, no permanent suicide units were
formed, and bombers were recruited and trained on an ad hoc, conditional
basis. But, in rare instances, some organizations adopt suicide terrorism
as a legitimate and permanent strategy, harkening back to the Japanese
kamikaze pilots of the Second World War.
Currently, the Sri Lankan Tamil Tigers are the only example of this
phenomenon. The "Black Tigers" launched their first attack in July 1987,
and since then suicide bombings have become an enduring feature of the
LTTE's ruthless struggle. During the last 13 years, 171 attacks have killed
hundreds of civilians and soldiers and wounded thousands more. The
assassinations of two heads of state, political leaders, and high-ranking
military officers have made it clear that no politician or public figure is
immune to these attacks.
The Black Tigers constitute the most significant proof that suicide
terrorism is not merely a religious phenomenon and that under certain
extreme political and psychological circumstances secular volunteers are
fully capable of martyrdom. The Tamil suicide bombers are not the product
of a religious cult, but rather a cult of personality: Velupillai
Prabhakaran, the brutal and charismatic LTTE leader who initiated the
practice, appears to have been greatly influenced by the spectacular
successes of Hezbollah in Lebanon. Fiercely determined to fight the
repressive Sinhalese government until the Tamils achieve independence,
Prabhakaran created the suicide units largely by the strength of his
personality and his unlimited control of the organization.
The formation of the Black Tigers was greatly facilitated by an early
practice of the organization's members: Since the early 1980s, all LTTE
fighters-male and female alike-have been required to carry potassium
cyanide capsules. A standard LTTE order makes it unequivocally clear that
soldiers are to consume the capsule's contents if capture is imminent. The
LTTE suicide units are essentially an extension of the organization's
general culture of supreme martyrdom; the passage from ordinary combat
soldier to suicide bomber is a short and tragic journey.
Making Suicide Terrorists Pay
The perceived strength of suicide bombers is that they are lone, irrational
fanatics who cannot be deterred. The actual weakness of suicide bombers is
that they are nothing more than the instruments of terrorist leaders who
expect their organizations to gain tangible benefits from this shocking
tactic. The key to countering suicide bombers, therefore, is to make
terrorist organizations aware that this decision will incur painful costs.
While no simple formula for countering suicide terrorism exists, the
experiences of the last two decades suggest two complementary political and
operational strategies.
Organizations only implement suicide terrorism systematically if their
community (and, in some cases, a foreign client state) approves of its use.
Thus, political and economic sanctions against the terrorists' community,
combined with effective coercive diplomacy against their foreign patrons,
may help reduce or end suicide terrorism. The problem with political
counterterrorism, however, is that it takes a long time to implement and
the results are never certain. The Taliban in Afghanistan, for instance,
continue to host Osama bin Laden (who was indicted by the United States in
November 1998 for the bombings of the two U.S. embassies in East Africa)
despite international sanctions, a unanimously adopted United Nations
Security Council Resolution demanding that he stand trial, and a threat
from the United States that the Taliban will be held responsible for any
terrorist acts undertaken while Bin Laden is under their protection.
The leaders of organizations that resort to suicide terrorism are evidently
ready to take great risks. Consequently, the political battle against
suicide bombers must always be enhanced by an aggressive operational
campaign. Governments do not have to invent entirely new tactics when
waging a war against suicide terrorists. Instead, they must adapt and
intensify existing counterterrorism strategies to exploit the
vulnerabilities of suicide bombers.
The Achilles' heel of suicide terrorists is that they are part of a large,
operational infrastructure. It may not be possible to profile and apprehend
would-be suicide bombers, but once it has been established that an
organization has resolved to use suicide terrorism, security services can
strike against the commanders and field officers who recruit and train the
assailants and then plan the attacks. This counterterrorism effort calls
for the formation of effective networks of informers, the constant
monitoring of potential collaborators, and close cooperation among
international intelligence services. Counterterrorist operatives must apply
consistent pressure on the terrorist infrastructure through harassment and
attacks. They must also seek ways to cut off the terrorists' sources of
funding by depriving organizations of their financial resources (such as
international bank accounts or "front" businesses). Regardless of the
presence or absence of hard evidence for planned operations, it is
essential to put potential terrorists on the run.
The physical protection of potential target areas is another essential
tactic. The idea of erecting concrete barriers against a martyr driving a
truck loaded with tons of explosives might strike some as ludicrously
inadequate. But such physical protection serves two essential objectives:
It reduces the effect of the suicide bombing if and when the terrorist hits
the target area, and it serves as a deterrent against potential suicide
strikes. For the terrorist field officers, who may never know when they
will be caught or killed, each suicide squad is precious. When faced with
highly protected areas, they are unlikely to send squads into action.
Roadblocks, guards at special checkpoints, inspection teams in public
places, and the use of dogs and artificial sniffing devices may drive
suicide terrorism down significantly.
Such security measures also reassure the public. Governments must never
forget that terrorism constitutes a form of psychological warfare, and that
suicide terrorism is the ultimate expression of this struggle. Terrorism
must always be fought psychologically-a battle that often takes place in
the minds of ordinary people. Even if governments do not have an immediate
operational solution to suicide terrorism, they must convince their
citizens that they are not sitting ducks and that the authorities are doing
everything they can to protect them. Ordinary people should, in fact, be
informed that psychological warfare is being waged against them. Free
people who are told that they are being subjected to psychological
manipulation are likely to develop strong terrorism antibodies.
In fighting suicide bombers, it is important not to succumb to the idea
that they are ready to do anything and lose everything. This is the same
sort of simplistic reasoning that has fueled the widespread hysteria over
terrorists acquiring weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The perception that
terrorists are undeterrable fanatics who are willing to kill millions
indiscriminately just to sow fear and chaos belies the reality that they
are cold, rational killers who employ violence to achieve specific
political objectives. Whereas the threat of WMD terrorism is little more
than overheated rhetoric, suicide bombing remains a devastating form of
terrorism whose complete demise is unlikely in the 21st century. The
ongoing political instability in the Middle East, Russia, and South
Asia-including Iran, Afghanistan, Chechnya, and possibly India and
Pakistan-suggests that these regions will continue to be high-risk areas,
with irregular suicide bombings occasionally extending to other parts of
the globe. But the present understanding of the high costs of suicide
terrorism and the growing cooperation among intelligence services worldwide
gives credence to the hope that in the future only desperate organizations
of losers will try to use this tactic on a systematic basis.

I hate to point out the obvious, but doesn't this whole WTC thing seems to be like it's a mossad operation to
I have no proof, of course, but the economics and the reverse-engineering of the logics of the whole events point to this conclusion.
1) Israel has been very well prepared in that the current and ex-prime ministers have been very well available
and have been talking on international television about this
incident from the moment it started.
2) The below news is very beneficial to Israel
3) Israel benefits the most from this incident politically
4) They have the resources to do something like this
5) Their politicians don't care about killing innocent people
6) They have done it before to the Americans (Sinking one of their ships)
7) The Mossad recruit palestinians for suicide missions and kill the
volunteers before they commit a bombing -> a short extention would be to
use them for their own benefit by having them do suicide attacks in the US to gain support for their policies in the middle east, and have US
attack the neighboring arab countries threatening Israel. 8) Osama has denied responsibility, yes he is "implicated" somehow by
the evidence.
9) Osama would not seem to benefit from this politically
or economically, or gain any support by doing this in the
Arab countries, as has been made clear
10) Iraelis' claim to have warned USA before hand...
etc. etc. etc.
Tons of coincidences and reportings of facts about this whole incident in the news.
Israel is very prominently playing this for all it's
worth, and seems incredibly very well prepared.
Of course, this does not mean that they had anything to do with it.
I'm just pointing out that they are getting the biggest benefit,
together with the military-industrial and spy-complexes of the USA.
Certainly a nice conspiracy theory? ;-)

a cause [see sidebar on page 70]. Furthermore, Merari maintains that no
organization can create a person's basic readiness to die. The task of
recruiters is not to produce but rather to identify this predisposition in
candidates and reinforce it. Recruiters will often exploit religious
beliefs when indoctrinating would-be bombers, using their subjects' faith
in a reward in paradise to strengthen and solidify preexisting sacrificial
motives. But other powerful motives reinforce tendencies toward martyrdom,
including patriotism, hatred of the enemy, and a profound sense of
Since suicide terrorism is an organizational phenomenon, the struggle
against it cannot be conducted on an individual level. Although profiling
suicide bombers may be a fascinating academic challenge, it is less
relevant in the real-world struggle against them than understanding the
modus operandi and mind-set of terrorist leaders who would never consider
killing themselves, but opt for suicide terrorism as a result of cold
The Care and Feeding
of a Suicide Bomber
A suicide terrorist is almost always the last link in a long organizational
chain that involves numerous actors. Once the decision to launch a suicide
attack has been made, its implementation requires at least six separate
operations: target selection, intelligence gathering, recruitment, physical
and "spiritual" training, preparation of explosives, and transportation of
the suicide bombers to the target area. Such a mission often involves
dozens of terrorists and accomplices who have no intention of committing
suicide, but without whom no suicide operation could take place.
A careful survey of all the organizations that have resorted to suicide
terrorism since 1983 suggests that the most meaningful distinction among
them involves the degree to which suicide bombing is institutionalized. At
the simplest level are groups that neither practice suicide terrorism on a
regular basis nor approve of its use as a tactic. Local members or
affiliates of such organizations, however, may initiate it on their own for
a variety of reasons, such as imitating the glorious acts of others,
responding to a perception of enormous humiliation and distress, avenging
the murder of comrades and relatives, or being presented with a special
opportunity to strike.
Within such a context, it is important to take into account what might be
called "pre-suicide terrorism." Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad suicide
operations in Israel during the 1990s were preceded by a wave of knifings
in the late 1980s. These attackers never planned an escape route and were
often killed on the spot. The knifings did not involve any known
organization and were mostly spontaneous. But they expressed a collective
mood among young Palestinians of jihad (holy war) against Israel that
helped create an atmosphere for the institutionalized suicide terrorism of
the next decade.
Many terrorist groups are skeptical of suicide terrorism's strategic value
but resort to this tactic in exceptional circumstances. Within this
category are the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
(allegedly executed by Osama bin Laden's Qaida organization) and similar
irregular attacks conducted over the years by the Egyptian Islamic Group,
the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the Kuwaiti Dawa, and the Algerian Armed
Islamic Group, among others. Such suicide bombings, though carefully
planned, are irregular and unsystematic.
At another level are groups that formally adopt suicide terrorism as a
temporary strategy. The leaders of these movements obtain (or grant)
ideological or theological legitimization for its use, recruit and train
volunteers, and then send them into action with a specific objective in
mind. The most spectacular operations of Hezbollah between 1983 and 1985,
of Hamas between 1994 and 1996, and of the PKK between 1995 and 1999 fall
within this category. More recently, Chechen rebels suddenly launched a
campaign of suicide bombings following nine months of inconclusive fighting
against the Russian military; one of the first bombers, a cousin of noted
rebel leader Arbi Barayev, had reportedly declared: "I am going willingly
to my death in the name of Allah and the freedom of the Chechen people."
In such cases, the institutionalization of suicide terrorism has been
temporary and conditional. Leaders who opt for this type of terrorism are
usually moved by an intense sense of crisis, a conviction in the
effectiveness of this new tactic, endorsement by the religious or
ideological establishment, and the enthusiastic support of their community.
At the same time, they are fully aware of the changeable nature of these
conditions and of the potential costs associated with suicide terrorism
(such as devastating military retaliation). They consequently have little
difficulty in suspending suicide bombing or calling it off entirely.
A case in point is Hezbollah's decision to begin suicide bombings in 1983.
It is known today that several leaders of the organization were extremely
uneasy about the practice. Insisting that Islam does not approve of
believers taking their own lives, clerics such as Sheikh Fadlallah raised
legal objections and were unwilling to allow the use of this new tactic.
However, suicide terrorism became so effective in driving foreigners out of
Lebanon that there was no motivation to stop it. The result was theological
hair splitting that characterized suicide bombers as exceptional soldiers
who risked their lives in a holy war. But following the Israeli withdrawal
from Lebanon in 1985 and the decreasing effectiveness of this tactic,
Hezbollah's clerics ordered the end of systematic suicide bombing. The
organization's fighters were instructed to protect their lives and continue
the struggle against the Zionists through conventional guerrilla methods.
Only rarely, and on an irregular basis, has Hezbollah allowed suicide
bombing since.
It is not exactly clear when the commanders of Hamas decided to turn their
anti-Israel suicide attacks into a strategic struggle against the peace
process. Their campaign, started haphazardly in 1992 against Israeli
military and settler targets in the occupied territories, failed to produce
glaring results. The 1994 Hebron Massacre, when Israeli doctor Baruch
Goldstein murdered 29 praying Palestinians, changed everything. Determined
to avenge the deaths of their countrymen, Hamas operators resorted to
suicide bus bombings inside Israeli cities. In a matter of weeks, the new
wave of terrorism had eroded Israel's collective confidence in the peace
process and had played right into the hands of extremist Hamas clerics who
opposed negotiations with Israel. Yet, in 1995 these attacks suddenly came
to a complete halt. Several factors convinced Hamas leaders to back off:
the growing Palestinian resentment against the costs of the bus bombings
(expressed in massive Israeli economic sanctions), the increasing
cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian security services, and the
effectiveness of Israeli counterterrorism.
Ironically, Israel unintentionally pushed the organization to resume the
bus bombings when, in 1996, then Prime Minister Shimon Peres ordered the
assassination of Yehiya Ayash (known as "the Engineer") -a Hamas operative
who masterminded many of the previous suicide bombings. Humiliated and
angered, Hamas temporarily resumed bus bombings in Israel. A series of
three successful attacks by Hamas and one by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad
changed Israel's political mood about the peace process and led to the 1996
electoral defeat of Peres and his pro-peace government.
In the cases of Hezbollah and Hamas, no permanent suicide units were
formed, and bombers were recruited and trained on an ad hoc, conditional
basis. But, in rare instances, some organizations adopt suicide terrorism
as a legitimate and permanent strategy, harkening back to the Japanese
kamikaze pilots of the Second World War.
Currently, the Sri Lankan Tamil Tigers are the only example of this
phenomenon. The "Black Tigers" launched their first attack in July 1987,
and since then suicide bombings have become an enduring feature of the
LTTE's ruthless struggle. During the last 13 years, 171 attacks have killed
hundreds of civilians and soldiers and wounded thousands more. The
assassinations of two heads of state, political leaders, and high-ranking
military officers have made it clear that no politician or public figure is
immune to these attacks.
The Black Tigers constitute the most significant proof that suicide
terrorism is not merely a religious phenomenon and that under certain
extreme political and psychological circumstances secular volunteers are
fully capable of martyrdom. The Tamil suicide bombers are not the product
of a religious cult, but rather a cult of personality: Velupillai
Prabhakaran, the brutal and charismatic LTTE leader who initiated the
practice, appears to have been greatly influenced by the spectacular
successes of Hezbollah in Lebanon. Fiercely determined to fight the
repressive Sinhalese government until the Tamils achieve independence,
Prabhakaran created the suicide units largely by the strength of his
personality and his unlimited control of the organization.
The formation of the Black Tigers was greatly facilitated by an early
practice of the organization's members: Since the early 1980s, all LTTE
fighters-male and female alike-have been required to carry potassium
cyanide capsules. A standard LTTE order makes it unequivocally clear that
soldiers are to consume the capsule's contents if capture is imminent. The
LTTE suicide units are essentially an extension of the organization's
general culture of supreme martyrdom; the passage from ordinary combat
soldier to suicide bomber is a short and tragic journey.
Making Suicide Terrorists Pay
The perceived strength of suicide bombers is that they are lone, irrational
fanatics who cannot be deterred. The actual weakness of suicide bombers is
that they are nothing more than the instruments of terrorist leaders who
expect their organizations to gain tangible benefits from this shocking
tactic. The key to countering suicide bombers, therefore, is to make
terrorist organizations aware that this decision will incur painful costs.
While no simple formula for countering suicide terrorism exists, the
experiences of the last two decades suggest two complementary political and
operational strategies.
Organizations only implement suicide terrorism systematically if their
community (and, in some cases, a foreign client state) approves of its use.
Thus, political and economic sanctions against the terrorists' community,
combined with effective coercive diplomacy against their foreign patrons,
may help reduce or end suicide terrorism. The problem with political
counterterrorism, however, is that it takes a long time to implement and
the results are never certain. The Taliban in Afghanistan, for instance,
continue to host Osama bin Laden (who was indicted by the United States in
November 1998 for the bombings of the two U.S. embassies in East Africa)
despite international sanctions, a unanimously adopted United Nations
Security Council Resolution demanding that he stand trial, and a threat
from the United States that the Taliban will be held responsible for any
terrorist acts undertaken while Bin Laden is under their protection.
The leaders of organizations that resort to suicide terrorism are evidently
ready to take great risks. Consequently, the political battle against
suicide bombers must always be enhanced by an aggressive operational
campaign. Governments do not have to invent entirely new tactics when
waging a war against suicide terrorists. Instead, they must adapt and
intensify existing counterterrorism strategies to exploit the
vulnerabilities of suicide bombers.
The Achilles' heel of suicide terrorists is that they are part of a large,
operational infrastructure. It may not be possible to profile and apprehend
would-be suicide bombers, but once it has been established that an
organization has resolved to use suicide terrorism, security services can
strike against the commanders and field officers who recruit and train the
assailants and then plan the attacks. This counterterrorism effort calls
for the formation of effective networks of informers, the constant
monitoring of potential collaborators, and close cooperation among
international intelligence services. Counterterrorist operatives must apply
consistent pressure on the terrorist infrastructure through harassment and
attacks. They must also seek ways to cut off the terrorists' sources of
funding by depriving organizations of their financial resources (such as
international bank accounts or "front" businesses). Regardless of the
presence or absence of hard evidence for planned operations, it is
essential to put potential terrorists on the run.
The physical protection of potential target areas is another essential
tactic. The idea of erecting concrete barriers against a martyr driving a
truck loaded with tons of explosives might strike some as ludicrously
inadequate. But such physical protection serves two essential objectives:
It reduces the effect of the suicide bombing if and when the terrorist hits
the target area, and it serves as a deterrent against potential suicide
strikes. For the terrorist field officers, who may never know when they
will be caught or killed, each suicide squad is precious. When faced with
highly protected areas, they are unlikely to send squads into action.
Roadblocks, guards at special checkpoints, inspection teams in public
places, and the use of dogs and artificial sniffing devices may drive
suicide terrorism down significantly.
Such security measures also reassure the public. Governments must never
forget that terrorism constitutes a form of psychological warfare, and that
suicide terrorism is the ultimate expression of this struggle. Terrorism
must always be fought psychologically-a battle that often takes place in
the minds of ordinary people. Even if governments do not have an immediate
operational solution to suicide terrorism, they must convince their
citizens that they are not sitting ducks and that the authorities are doing
everything they can to protect them. Ordinary people should, in fact, be
informed that psychological warfare is being waged against them. Free
people who are told that they are being subjected to psychological
manipulation are likely to develop strong terrorism antibodies.
In fighting suicide bombers, it is important not to succumb to the idea
that they are ready to do anything and lose everything. This is the same
sort of simplistic reasoning that has fueled the widespread hysteria over
terrorists acquiring weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The perception that
terrorists are undeterrable fanatics who are willing to kill millions
indiscriminately just to sow fear and chaos belies the reality that they
are cold, rational killers who employ violence to achieve specific
political objectives. Whereas the threat of WMD terrorism is little more
than overheated rhetoric, suicide bombing remains a devastating form of
terrorism whose complete demise is unlikely in the 21st century. The
ongoing political instability in the Middle East, Russia, and South
Asia-including Iran, Afghanistan, Chechnya, and possibly India and
Pakistan-suggests that these regions will continue to be high-risk areas,
with irregular suicide bombings occasionally extending to other parts of
the globe. But the present understanding of the high costs of suicide
terrorism and the growing cooperation among intelligence services worldwide
gives credence to the hope that in the future only desperate organizations
of losers will try to use this tactic on a systematic basis.

Personally, I prefer the strategy Israel uses with Palestinian

if and when a certain number is called (like mossad suicide-attack

Maybe US airplanes should have remotely activated explosive devices in them, so that when the next inevitable revenge of a revenge of a revenge highjacking occurs, the people in Washington can just press
the button and explode the plane over the sea.

Bush gives green light to CIA for assassination of named terrorists
'Covert killings to take in less important al-Qaida figures'
David Gow in New York
Monday October 29, 2001
The Guardian
President Bush has given the CIA an explicit go-ahead to carry out covert
missions to assassinate Osama bin Laden and his supporters around the world,
effectively lifting a 25-year ban on such activities.
The US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, confirmed reports of such a move
yesterday by telling CNN that the US would be acting in self-defence in
carrying out such missions.
The Washington Post reported yesterday that Mr Bush has decided that
executive orders banning assassinations since a series of botched attempts
in the 1960s and 1970s allow him to single out a named terrorist or
terrorists for death by covert action.
Mr Rumsfeld said: "It is not possible to defend yourself against terrorists
at every single location in the world and at every single moment.
"The only way to deal with terrorists is to take the battle to them and find
them and root them out and that's self-defence. We're going after these
people and their organisations and capabilities and to stop them killing
The US president, according to senior government officials quoted by the
Post, signed an order last month known as an intelligence "finding", which
broadens the list of potential targets beyond Bin Laden and his immediate
circle of some 15 operational planners - and beyond Afghanistan.
The CIA, pilloried in some quarters along with the FBI last month for its
fatal failure to detect the movements and plans of the al-Qaida terrorist
network, is said to be willing and able to "take the lives of terrorists
designated by the president".
Mr Bush has apparently circumvented the legal constraints on clandestine
killing missions imposed since the Church committee found in 1975 that plots
against five foreign leaders under presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy and Nixon
had been organised in terms "so ambiguous that it is difficult to be certain
at what levels assassination activity was known and authorised".
The new presidential order, drawing on one signed by President Clinton
against al-Qaida three years ago, apparently overcomes such problems by
making plain that responsibility and accountability rest with the president
and his senior colleagues.
"I would want the president's guidance to be as clear as it could be,
including the names of individuals. You have got to have the political
levels behind you so the intelligence officers are not left hanging," the
recently retired CIA deputy director, John Gannon, told the Post.
But history suggests that covert assassinations remain fraught with danger
and carry a high risk of failure.
Jeffrey Richelson, an intelligence historian and author of a new book on the
CIA, said of pre-1975 efforts: "They never succeeded in killing anyone. They
were the gang that couldn't shoot straight."
Agents carried out numerous inept missions to kill Fidel Castro, using among
other botched devices bacteria in his favourite type of cigar, an exploding
seashell, and a poisoned wet suit. Other botched missions were undertaken in
central America, the Congo and Iraq, though Mr Richelson has said the CIA
did significantly aid the assassins of Che Guevara, and, indirectly, the
overthrow of Chile's Salvador Allende in 1973.
Yesterday's report suggested that President Bush's order could extend well
beyond the al-Qaida network concentrated around Bin Laden and the FBI's 22
"most-wanted" terrorists, with the CIA debating how many of the 35 or more
countries identified as places where the terrorist network is active could
figure on the list.
Andrew Card, White House chief of staff, said yesterday on NBC's Meet the
Press: "It could take years but we are going to do everything we can to rout
the terrorists in Afghanistan and then get them all around the world."
Financiers of the al-Qaida - "the Gucci guys, the guys who write the
cheques", according to one unnamed CIA official - could also be targets but
the report said it was unclear whether Mr Bush had "signed orders that would
amount to individual death warrants".

Bush Order on Military Tribunals is Further Evidence
That Government is Abandoning Democracy's Checks and Balances
Statement of Laura W. Murphy, Director
ACLU Washington National Office
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, November 14, 2001
WASHINGTON -- The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply disturbed by President Bush's executive order allowing special military tribunals to try non-citizens charged with terrorism. The tribunals would even reach non-citizens in the United States, including lawful permanent residents.
To our knowledge, the move to establish a military tribunal when Congress has not declared war is unprecedented.
We do not believe that the Administration has shown that the constitutional jury trial system does not allow for the prosecution of those accused of terrorist activities. Absent such a compelling justification, the President's decision is further evidence that the Administration is totally unwilling to abide by the checks and balances that are so central to our democracy.
The use of military tribunals would apparently authorize secret trials without a jury and without the requirement of a unanimous verdict and would limit a defendant's opportunities to confront the evidence against him and choose his own lawyer. What's worse, these important legal protections would be removed in a situation where defendants may very well be facing the death penalty.
It is difficult to understand how the Administration can justify the use of a tribunal when the United States has successfully tried in our courts non-citizens accused of terrorist acts, organized crime, and others in situations where the safety of jurors and the disclosure of government intelligence methods were at issue.
As the prosecutions of the 1993 World Trade Center bombers and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh demonstrate, the government has managed to protect the safety and identity of jurors while achieving convictions in terrorism cases. And there is already a system established to handle classified information in the course of a trial; it is called the Classified Information Procedures Act. For decades, CIPA has adequately balanced national security and due process concerns. The government has made no showing that CIPA procedures would not be adequate in these circumstances as well.
Further, it would be hypocritical of the United States to impose such a tribunal when we have repeatedly protested the use of such courts against U.S. citizens abroad.
Congress has already given the Administration and the Justice Department virtually everything they asked for to fight terrorism. This latest move, combined with the Justice Department's announced intentions to eavesdrop on attorney conversations with inmates and to begin interviewing foreign visitors to the United States, demonstrates the government's increasing willingness to circumvent the requirements of the Bill of Rights.
We call on Congress to exercise its oversight powers before the Bill of Rights in America is distorted beyond recognition.

Many folks wrote to me pointing out that President Bush's order was
online this morning, probably by the time I sent my note to
Politech. It also appeared in today's New York Times. Mea culpa. I
wrote my note last night, but did not doublecheck before sending it
out this morning and heading off to the Cato Institute conference for
the day.
I haven't has as much time to look at this as I'd like, but the order
says military tribunals will hear cases dealing with only an accused
terrorist "who is not a United States citizen."
Jason Zengerle has a perhaps-prescient article giving arguments
for a military tribunal here:

    Military Order
    Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War
    Against Terrorism
    By the authority vested in me as President and as Commander in Chief
    of the Armed Forces of the United States by the Constitution and the
    laws of the United States of America, including the Authorization for
    Use of Military Force Joint Resolution (Public Law 107-40, 115 Stat.
    224) and sections 821 and 836 of title 10, United States Code, it is
    hereby ordered as follows:
    Section 1.  Findings.
    (a)  International terrorists, including members of al Qaida, have
    carried out attacks on United States diplomatic and military personnel
    and facilities abroad and on citizens and property within the United
    States on a scale that has created a state of armed conflict that
    requires the use of the United States Armed Forces.
    (b)  In light of grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism,
    including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, on the
    headquarters of the United States Department of Defense in the
    national capital region, on the World Trade Center in New York, and on
    civilian aircraft such as in Pennsylvania, I proclaimed a national
    emergency on September 14, 2001 (Proc. 7463, Declaration of National
    Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks).
    (c)  Individuals acting alone and in concert involved in international
    terrorism possess both the capability and the intention to undertake
    further terrorist attacks against the United States that, if not
    detected and prevented, will cause mass deaths, mass injuries, and
    massive destruction of property, and may place at risk the continuity
    of the operations of the United States Government.
    (d)  The ability of the United States to protect the United States and
    its citizens, and to help its allies and other cooperating nations
    protect their nations and their citizens, from such further terrorist
    attacks depends in significant part upon using the United States Armed
    Forces to identify terrorists and those who support them, to disrupt
    their activities, and to eliminate their ability to conduct or support
    such attacks.
    (e)  To protect the United States and its citizens, and for the
    effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist
    attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order
    pursuant to section 2 hereof to be detained, and, when tried, to be
    tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by
    military tribunals.
    more
    (OVER)
    2
    (f)  Given the danger to the safety of the United States and the
    nature of international terrorism, and to the extent provided by and
    under this order, I find consistent with section 836 of title 10,
    United States Code, that it is not practicable to apply in military
    commissions under this order the principles of law and the rules of
    evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the
    United States district courts.
    (g)  Having fully considered the magnitude of the potential deaths,
    injuries, and property destruction that would result from potential
    acts of terrorism against the United States, and the probability that
    such acts will occur, I have determined that an extraordinary
    emergency exists for national defense purposes, that this emergency
    constitutes an urgent and compelling govern-ment interest, and that
    issuance of this order is necessary to meet the emergency.
    Sec. 2.  Definition and Policy.
    (a)  The term "individual subject to this order" shall mean any
    individual who is not a United States citizen with respect to whom I
    determine from time to time in writing that:
    (1)  there is reason to believe that such individual, at the relevant
    times,
    (i) is or was a member of the organization known as al Qaida;
    (ii) has engaged in, aided or abetted, or conspired to commit,
    acts of international terrorism, or acts in preparation therefor,
    that have caused, threaten to cause, or have as their aim to
    cause, injury to or adverse effects on the United States, its
    citizens, national security, foreign policy, or economy; or
    (iii) has knowingly harbored one or more individuals described in
    subparagraphs (i) or (ii) of subsection 2(a)(1) of this order;
    and
    (2)  it is in the interest of the United States that such individual
    be subject to this order.
    (b)  It is the policy of the United States that the Secretary of
    Defense shall take all necessary measures to ensure that any
    individual subject to this order is detained in accordance with
    section 3, and, if the individual is to be tried, that such individual
    is tried only in accordance with section 4.
    (c)  It is further the policy of the United States that any individual
    subject to this order who is not already under the control of the
    Secretary of Defense but who is under the control of any other officer
    or agent of the United States or any State shall, upon delivery of a
    copy of such written determination to such officer or agent, forthwith
    be placed under the control of the Secretary of Defense.
    Sec. 3.  Detention Authority of the Secretary of Defense. Any
    individual subject to this order shall be --
    (a)  detained at an appropriate location designated by the Secretary
    of Defense outside or within the United States;
    (b)  treated humanely, without any adverse distinction based on race,
    color, religion, gender, birth, wealth, or any similar criteria;
    more
    3
    (c)  afforded adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, and
    medical treatment;
    (d)  allowed the free exercise of religion consistent with the
    requirements of such detention; and
    (e)  detained in accordance with such other conditions as the
    Secretary of Defense may prescribe.
    Sec. 4.  Authority of the Secretary of Defense Regarding Trials of
    Individuals Subject to this Order.
    (a)  Any individual subject to this order shall, when tried, be tried
    by military commission for any and all offenses triable by military
    commission that such individual is alleged to have committed, and may
    be punished in accordance with the penalties provided under applicable
    law, including life imprisonment or death.
    (b)  As a military function and in light of the findings in section 1,
    including subsection (f) thereof, the Secretary of Defense shall issue
    such orders and regulations, including orders for the appointment of
    one or more military commissions, as may be necessary to carry out
    subsection (a) of this section.
    (c)  Orders and regulations issued under subsection (b) of this
    section shall include, but not be limited to, rules for the conduct of
    the proceedings of military commissions, including pretrial, trial,
    and post-trial procedures, modes of proof, issuance of process, and
    qualifications of attorneys, which shall at a minimum provide for --
    (1)  military commissions to sit at any time and any place, consistent
    with such guidance regarding time and place as the Secretary of
    Defense may provide;
    (2)  a full and fair trial, with the military commission sitting as
    the triers of both fact and law;
    (3)  admission of such evidence as would, in the opinion of the
    presiding officer of the military commission (or instead, if any other
    member of the commission so requests at the time the presiding officer
    renders that opinion, the opinion of the commission rendered at that
    time by a majority of the commission), have probative value to a
    reasonable person;
    (4)  in a manner consistent with the protection of information
    classified or classifiable under Executive Order 12958 of April 17,
    1995, as amended, or any successor Executive Order, protected by
    statute or rule from unauthorized disclosure, or otherwise protected
    by law, (A) the handling of, admission into evidence of, and access to
    materials and information, and (B) the conduct, closure of, and access
    to proceedings;
    (5)  conduct of the prosecution by one or more attorneys designated by
    the Secretary of Defense and conduct of the defense by attorneys for
    the individual subject to this order;
    (6)  conviction only upon the concurrence of two-thirds of the members

It's simple, maybe unethical and way off the moral high ground we claim to be
staking out but effective and legal under the US Constitution. Make sure you
check for any text that says these protections apply to non-citizens.  While
I am unqualified to comment on the national security aspect of these issues,
there certainly are security issues presented by them. I quote the US
Constitution, 14th Amendment:
Amendment XIV
Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject
to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the
state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor
shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws.
Under this reading, the rights accorded under our federal constitution are
not extended beyond US Citizens without regard to location of those citizens.
I read this to require treatment by the US of US citizens abroad the same as
in the US.
- Paul Gormley
criminal defense attorney in Massachusetts
You don't feel outraged if it applies ONLY to non-americans?
How would you people feel if we took the same liberty
to try and execute suspected American terrorists and
hold secret tribunals for them?
It is just a question of perspective - one man's freedom fighter
is another man's terrorist, like the Taleban have learned. The
victor writes the history - and can re-write it again, like the
Americans have proved to the Taleban.
Why can't countries respect each other's citizens' rights? Or
more specifically, why is it that America has such a big problem
understanding that perhaps the non-Americans consider themselves
worthy of the same basic human rights? Is that arrogant of (us)
non-Americans? It is *this* very attitude which is birthing the
"hate" towards the US, that very "hate" which americans find so
hard to understand, and account it to envy and jealousy.
If you can't afford to give other people/nations the respect
they deserve, you shouldn't expect to get any in return.

@_subject: Gross Usurpation of Power 
Gross Usurpation of Power
by David Dieteman
The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government.
~ Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2 (1866)
A great many conservatives have uncritically accepted the expansion of government powers in the wake of the terrible events of September 11. They have acquiesced in the creation of the Bureau of Homeland Security, an entity which would have made the Founding Fathers cringe, if not revolt (they revolted against much less).
One hopes that such alleged conservatives, who profess to value limited government, the rule of law, and liberty, will be disturbed by one of President Bush's recent actions.
On November 13, President Bush signed an order allowing military trials of terrorism suspects, rather than civil courts. As the Washington Post reports,
The presidential directive, signed by Bush as commander in chief, applies to non-U.S. citizens arrested in the United States or abroad. The president himself will decide which defendants will be tried by military tribunals. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld will appoint each panel and set its rules and procedures, including the level of proof needed for a conviction. There will be no judicial review.
The only review will be by the U.S. President and the Secretary of Defense. No American court, and no international tribunal, will be able to review the acts of this Star Chamber.
The administration seeks to avoid the Constitution by applying the order only to foreigners, rather than to U.S. citizens. Guess what: that's largely unconstitutional as well.
The guarantee of due process of law is universal in its application to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction of a state or the United States, without regard to any differences of race, color, or nationality, when they have come within the territory of the United States and have developed substantial connections with this country. 16B Am. Jur.2d Constitutional Law § 928; U.S. v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 110 S.Ct. 1056, 1064 (1990).
As a matter of international law, it may be argued that, if the foreign state consents to American exercise of such power overseas, i.e., if Afghanistan consents to an American Star Chamber handing out death sentences to Afghans, then such power is legitimately exercised. This would be a matter of treaty, or other such international agreement.
Such a new policy, however, would be contrary to what is arguably an evolving norm of international law, i.e., utilizing international tribunals to try war criminals. In the case of Nuremberg, Rwanda, and the former Yugoslavia, international tribunals were established to handle war crimes. These tribunals have been attacked as conducting mere show trials, which is bad enough. The Bush administration complains, however, that international tribunals do not administer the death penalty.
This is disturbing, even if possibly allowed under international law. Recall that last week, the Justice Department authorized the wiretapping of conversations between prisoners and their attorneys. So much for attorney-client privilege.
What's next: wiretaps in the confessional?
And another question: remember Senator Kerrey? So much for quick justice when an American is accused. What if Vietnam were a superpower seeking to impose a Star Chamber on a feeble and impoverished United States? Does might make right? To some people, it seems that it does.
Note: with respect to Senator Kerrey, and to the Afghan war, I continue to have grave reservations about international criminal tribunals. A military tribunal would be appropriate for Kerrey because he is accused of crimes while a member of the armed forces; that is within the jurisdiction of a military tribunal. In addition, I would not object if those foreigners seized by the United States in the war on terrorism were tried in U.S. civil courts; that is within the jurisdiction of the civil courts. The problem with President Bush's order is that it simply ignores the Constitutional limits on executive power.
The due process of law is not given when the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments are simply ignored. As Justice Davis wrote in Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2 (1866),
Certainly no part of judicial power of the country was conferred on them, because the Constitution expressly vests it "in one supreme court and such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish," and it is not pretended that the commission was a court ordained and established by Congress. They cannot justify on the mandate of the President, because he is controlled by law, and has his appropriate sphere of duty, which is to execute, not to make, the laws, and there is "no unwritten criminal code to which resort can be had as a source of jurisdiction."
To be blunt, President Bush has no authority under the U.S. Constitution to make such an order. None. Zip. Zero. Zilch. Nada.
Albert Gonzales, a former Texas Supreme Court judge, claimed that there was precedent for the order. Indeed there is. It is bad Abraham Lincoln famously tried opponents of the War Between the States in military courts. The United States Supreme Court unambiguously declared in Ex parte Milligan, however, that it was unconstitutional to try civilians before a military court when the civil courts, i.e., the regular courthouses you see on The Practice, were open and operating, and in no way threatened by the war.
As Justice Davis wrote in Milligan, (read the opinion here),
there are occasions when martial rule can be properly applied. If, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, then, on the theatre of active military operations, where war really prevails, there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society; and as no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course. As necessity creates the rule, so it limits its duration; for, if this government is continued after the courts are reinstated, it is a gross usurpation of power. Martial rule can never exist where the courts are open, and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction. It is also confined to the locality of actual war.
Note the following: no civil courts are "actually closed" in the United States today. There is no "theatre of active military operations, where war really prevails" such that the civil courts cannot function.
This, as the Milligan court noted, is a gross usurpation of power.
The factual circumstances confronted by Milligan, if anything, were more serious than those facing the United States today. Lambdin Milligan, a citizen of Indiana, was arrested for allegedly conspiring to capture an arsenal, free Confederate prisoners, and for intending to join Confederate forces in Missouri. He was brought before a Military Commission, and sentenced to death.
Despite the fact that there was a war going on, the court found that the military trial was unconstitutional.
Very importantly, the court observed that
No graver question was ever considered by this court, nor one which nearly concerns the rights of the whole people; for it is the birthright of every American citizen when charged with crime, to be tried and punished according to law. The power of punishment is alone through the means which the laws have provided for that purpose, and if they are ineffectual, there is an immunity from punishment, no matter how great an offender the individual may be, or how much his crimes may have shocked the sense of justice of the country, or endangered its safety. By the protection of the law human rights are secured; withdraw that protection, and they are at the mercy of wicked rulers, or the clamor of an excited people.
The rule set forth in Ex parte Milligan, then, squarely controls any decision regarding the order issued by President Bush.
The order is unconstitutional, plain and simple.
"No emergency justifies the violation of any of the provisions of the United States Constitution. An emergency...cannot create power...but may allow the exercise of power already in existence, but not exercised except during an emergency." 16B Am. Jur.2d Constitutional Law § 52 (citations omitted).
As the Nebraska Supreme Court put it, the Constitution was adopted in a state of emergency, the limits on the powers of the government were conceived in the light of emergency, and the limits are not changed by emergency. First Trust Co. v. Smith, 134 Neb. 84, 115, 277 N.W. 762, 778 (1938).
For those wondering why such an order was signed, the Washington Post reports that the move was encouraged
for weeks by conservative lawyers from past administrations and other experts who cited precedents dating back to the Civil War. One of them, George Terwilliger, a former high-ranking Justice Department official, said a military tribunal would be appropriate for anyone who commits an act of war against the United States.
In fact, Terwilliger was the former Deputy Attorney General to George Bush. He handled the Florida election cases for President Bush. Although he is now in private practice, he was reported to have been a leading candidate to be head of the FBI.
The administration has sought to justify the order on the grounds that "This is a global war. To have successful prosecutions, we might have to give up sources and methods" in a civilian court. "We don't want to have to do that," Albert Gonzales told ABC News.
The Washington Post, meanwhile, reports that President Bush claimed the tribunals are needed because terrorism could "place at risk the continuity of the operations of the United States government." It is "not practicable," he said, to require the tribunals to abide by the "principles of law and the rules of evidence" that govern U.S. criminal prosecutions.
Does the Taliban have troops on the streets of Washington, DC? No. And yet it's "not practicable" to follow the principles of law and the rules of evidence. To put it mildly, this is a dangerous step for the government to take.
Much like the Patriot Act, which Rep. Ron Paul reports was not given to members to read before it was voted upon. The Patriot Act, by the way, authorizes increased governmental snooping powers which do not require a warrant, and which are therefore contrary to the The Patriot Act is unconstitutional due to the fact that even social emergencies "cannot routinely justify invasions of privacy or restrictions on expression without devaluing and eventually destroying those rights." Halperin v. Kissinger, 606 F.2d 1192, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 1979)(subsequent history omitted), cited in 16B Am. Jur.2d Constitutional Law § 52. (Halperin v. Kissinger, by the way, cites Milligan for the proposition that only when the courthouses are physically closed may normal judicial processes be circumvented).
The reason? "It would be ironic if, in the name of national defense, we would sanction the subversion of one of those liberties which makes the defense of the nation worthwhile." Halperin v. Kissinger, 606 F.2d 1192, 1199 (D.C. Cir. 1979).
So which is it: do conservatives have no sense of irony, or do they have no respect for constitutional liberty?
A pair of Texans ought to be ashamed to follow precedent established by Abraham Lincoln in a war against Texas. A Republican president, and an alleged "conservative," ought to be ashamed to follow the arch-Democrat, FDR.
President Bush should repeal his order. It is unconstitutional, unwise, and unnecessary.

Reply-To: ParanoidTimes
For Immediate Release
Office of the Press Secretary
November 13, 2001 Military Order Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism By the authority vested in me as President and as Commander in Chief of
the Armed Forces of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of
the United States of America, including the Authorization for Use of
Military Force Joint Resolution (Public Law 107-40, 115 Stat. 224) and
sections 821 and 836 of title 10, United States Code, it is hereby ordered
as follows:
Section 1.  Findings.
(a)  International terrorists, including members of al Qaida, have carried
out attacks on United States diplomatic and military personnel and
facilities abroad and on citizens and property within the United States on
a scale that has created a state of armed conflict that requires the use
of the United States Armed Forces.
(b)  In light of grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism,
including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, on the headquarters
of the United States Department of Defense in the national capital region,
on the World Trade Center in New York, and on civilian aircraft such as in
Pennsylvania, I proclaimed a national emergency on September 14, 2001
(Proc. 7463, Declaration of National Emergency by Reason of Certain
Terrorist Attacks).
(c)  Individuals acting alone and in concert involved in international
terrorism possess both the capability and the intention to undertake
further terrorist attacks against the United States that, if not detected
and prevented, will cause mass deaths, mass injuries, and massive
destruction of property, and may place at risk the continuity of the
operations of the United States Government.
(d)  The ability of the United States to protect the United States and its
citizens, and to help its allies and other cooperating nations protect
their nations and their citizens, from such further terrorist attacks
depends in significant part upon using the United States Armed Forces to
identify terrorists and those who support them, to disrupt their
activities, and to eliminate their ability to conduct or support such
(e)  To protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective
conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is
necessary for individuals subject to this order pursuant to section 2
hereof to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the
laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.
(f)  Given the danger to the safety of the United States and the nature of
international terrorism, and to the extent provided by and under this
order, I find consistent with section 836 of title 10, United States Code,
that it is not practicable to apply in military commissions under this
order the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized
in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts.
(g)  Having fully considered the magnitude of the potential deaths,
injuries, and property destruction that would result from potential acts
of terrorism against the United States, and the probability that such acts
will occur, I have determined that an extraordinary emergency exists for
national defense purposes, that this emergency constitutes an urgent and
compelling government interest, and that issuance of this order is
necessary to meet the emergency.
Sec. 2.  Definition and Policy.
(a)  The term "individual subject to this order" shall mean any individual
who is not a United States citizen with respect to whom I determine from
time to time in writing that:
  (1)  there is reason to believe that such individual, at the relevant times,
    (i) is or was a member of the organization known as al Qaida;     (ii) has engaged in, aided or abetted, or conspired to commit, acts of
international terrorism, or acts in preparation therefor, that have
caused, threaten to cause, or have as their aim to cause, injury to or
adverse effects on the United States, its citizens, national security,
foreign policy, or economy; or
    (iii) has knowingly harbored one or more individuals described in
subparagraphs (i) or (ii) of subsection 2(a)(1) of this order; and
  (2)  it is in the interest of the United States that such individual be
subject to this order.
(b)  It is the policy of the United States that the Secretary of Defense
shall take all necessary measures to ensure that any individual subject to
this order is detained in accordance with section 3, and, if the
individual is to be tried, that such individual is tried only in
accordance with section 4.
(c)  It is further the policy of the United States that any individual
subject to this order who is not already under the control of the
Secretary of Defense but who is under the control of any other officer or
agent of the United States or any State shall, upon delivery of a copy of
such written determination to such officer or agent, forthwith be placed
under the control of the Secretary of Defense.
Sec. 3.  Detention Authority of the Secretary of Defense. Any individual subject to this order shall be -- (a)  detained at an appropriate location designated by the Secretary of
Defense outside or within the United States;
(b)  treated humanely, without any adverse distinction based on race,
color, religion, gender, birth, wealth, or any similar criteria;
(c)  afforded adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, and
medical treatment;
(d)  allowed the free exercise of religion consistent with the
requirements of such detention; and
(e)  detained in accordance with such other conditions as the Secretary of
Defense may prescribe.
Sec. 4.  Authority of the Secretary of Defense Regarding Trials of
Individuals Subject to this Order.
(a)  Any individual subject to this order shall, when tried, be tried by
military commission for any and all offenses triable by military
commission that such individual is alleged to have committed, and may be
punished in accordance with the penalties provided under applicable law,
including life imprisonment or death.
(b)  As a military function and in light of the findings in section 1,
including subsection (f) thereof, the Secretary of Defense shall issue
such orders and regulations, including orders for the appointment of one
or more military commissions, as may be necessary to carry out subsection
(a) of this section.
(c)  Orders and regulations issued under subsection (b) of this section
shall include, but not be limited to, rules for the conduct of the
proceedings of military commissions, including pretrial, trial, and
post-trial procedures, modes of proof, issuance of process, and
qualifications of attorneys, which shall at a minimum provide for --
  (1)  military commissions to sit at any time and any place, consistent
with such guidance regarding time and place as the Secretary of Defense
may provide;
  (2)  a full and fair trial, with the military commission sitting as the
triers of both fact and law;
  (3)  admission of such evidence as would, in the opinion of the
presiding officer of the military commission (or instead, if any other
member of the commission so requests at the time the presiding officer
renders that opinion, the opinion of the commission rendered at that time
by a majority of the commission), have probative value to a reasonable
  (4)  in a manner consistent with the protection of information
classified or classifiable under Executive Order 12958 of April 17, 1995,
as amended, or any successor Executive Order, protected by statute or rule
from unauthorized disclosure, or otherwise protected by law, (A) the
handling of, admission into evidence of, and access to materials and
information, and (B) the conduct, closure of, and access to proceedings;
  (5)  conduct of the prosecution by one or more attorneys designated by
the Secretary of Defense and conduct of the defense by attorneys for the
individual subject to this order;
  (6)  conviction only upon the concurrence of two-thirds of the members
of the commission present at the time of the vote, a majority being
  (7)  sentencing only upon the concurrence of two-thirds of the members
of the commission present at the time of the vote, a majority being
present; and
  (8)  submission of the record of the trial, including any conviction or
sentence, for review and final decision by me or by the Secretary of
Defense if so designated by me for that purpose.
Sec. 5.  Obligation of Other Agencies to Assist the Secretary of Defense.
Departments, agencies, entities, and officers of the United States shall,
to the maximum extent permitted by law, provide to the Secretary of
Defense such assistance as he may request to implement this order.
Sec. 6.  Additional Authorities of the Secretary of Defense.
(a)  As a military function and in light of the findings in section 1, the
Secretary of Defense shall issue such orders and regulations as may be
necessary to carry out any of the provisions of this order.
(b)  The Secretary of Defense may perform any of his functions or duties,
and may exercise any of the powers provided to him under this order (other
than under section 4(c)(8) hereof) in accordance with section 113(d) of
title 10, United States Code.

RIAA Wants Background Checks on CD-RW Buyers
Washington DC - The RIAA is lobbying for vendors of CD-RW drives to
conduct background checks and require a 3 day waiting period before the
drive can be sold.
The extensive background check would include cross referencing credit card
numbers with local merchants sales logs looking for purchases of
dual-cassette decks between the years of 1980 and 1987. It would also
include checking for installation of file sharing software, knowledge of
the Internet, and the ability to hum. Any of which would bar the purchaser
from receiving his drive.
Saaaatan? "A CD-RW can be a dangerous weapon when it falls into the wrong
hands," said RIAA President Hilary Rosen, "You wouldn't sell a gun to a
convicted felon and you shouldn't sell a CD-RW drive to a Gnutella user.
The 3 day waiting period gives us time to verify that no copyrighted
material is on the purchasers hard drive and to make sure they have a
membership in the Columbia House CD club."
Current owners of CD-RW drives would be required to obtain a license for
use of the drive or face stiff fines. Licenses could be obtained by
enrollment at a local RIAA Education Camp where the horrors of copyright
violation would be instilled with the use of electro-shock therapy.
"I was alarmed when I heard that children had the ability to burn CDs
right on their computers," said Senator Strom Thurmond, "We've tried to
educate parents on the dangers of children playing with fire, and now
these death merchants sell them that ability in a shiny metal box." Other
Senators voiced their concerns about the possible violations of privacy in
the proposed legislation, but since it was called the Copyright Patriotism
Act they are unable to oppose it.
"The RIAA has gone too far this time. There are uses for CD-RW drives that
don't violate RIAA copyrights like burning multiple copies of Microsoft
Office for friends and neighbors," said Matthew Sodor an opponent of the
legislation. Other News:

Reply-To: Law & Policy of Computer Communications Article III extends the judicial power to cases arising under the
Constitution, laws of the United States, etc. Article I authorizes Congress
to define and punish offenses against the law of nations, something
apparently apart from the laws of the United States. The real issue is not
an Article III tribunal vs an Article I tribunal, but whether you get the
little niceties like a public trial, a jury, and a lawyer. In other words,
it's not about whether the military tribunal has jurisdiction, but whether
the "defendant" has constitutional rights in either forum.
Wong Wing v. U.S., 163 US 228 (1896) holds that resident aliens are
entitled to the protection of the 5th and 6th Amendment (due process, jury
trial) if they are to be charged and imprisoned instead of deported. U.S.
v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 US 1092 (1990) distinguishes Wong Wing in holding
the 4th Amendment does not apply to searches outside of the United States
where the alien has "no significant voluntary connection" to the U.S. In
that case the defendant was grabbed and his house searched in Mexico before
he was whisked into the U.S. for trial, where his 4th Amendment claims were
rejected because the Bill of Rights doesn't protect non-resident aliens. It
is likely that the rationale of Verdugo-Urquidez supports the
constitutionality of the executive order as applied to alleged terrorists
captured in Afghanistan, and either tried there or like Verdugo-Rodriguez
brought here involuntarily. Non-resident aliens are simply unprotected by
the Bill of Rights.
With respect to those captured in the U.S., Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1
(1942) indicates that "unlawful belligerents" accused of violations of the
"laws of war" are not entitled to jury trials because violations of the
laws of war were not among the crimes triable by jury at common law (like
claims in equity). The problem is the uncertain scope of the terms "laws of
war" and "unlawful belligerents" -- Quirin seems to be define each only by
reference to the other, and the terms seem even less exact today than they
did in 1942. Quirin characterizes as unlawful belligerents (in contrast
with lawful belligerents who must be treated as POWs) those "secretly
passing through the defenses of the United States in civilian dress, for
purpose of committing hostile acts." In the context of the current "war on
terrorism," the terrorists found in the U.S. likely qualify as unlawful
belligerents if they are here to commit "hostile acts." It seems to me that
"hostile acts" might include money laundering, drug smuggling, even credit
card fraud. It's not even clear that the "hostile acts" have to be
otherwise criminal acts, but it is clear from Quirin that ordinary crimes,
like conspiracy to blow up a building, can be re-cast as violations of the
law of war when perpetrated by "unlawful belligerents." Moreover, Quirin
indicates that even U.S. citizenship does not entitle an unlawful
belligerent to a jury trial. Quirin claimed to have been a citizen since he
was 4 years old, an issue that the Court found unnecessary to address.
The problem with this is that in Quirin the court looked to a real
honest-to-god declaration of war as the source of the President's authority
to send the German spies to a military tribunal. This time, we're looking
at a joint resolution authorizing the President to use necessary and
appropriate force to end terrorism, which is undefined. The foreign
belligerent is not a foreign nation, but a network that is not altogether
foreign. It raises a question as to whether there is a distinction between
a war on terrorism, and, for example, a war on drug trafficking; or whether
terrorism might be defined to include drug trafficking, or almost any other
anti-social behavior that we want to deal with free of all the nasty
complications caused by lawyers and juries. How hard would it be to define
people who blow up abortion clinics, or set free lab animals, or write
computer viruses, or (you'll like this, Andrew) distribute DeCSS, as among
the enemies in the war against terrorism.

Applied Digital pushes microchip to plant in foreigners for tracking
By Deborah Circelli, Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
   PALM BEACH -- Today's security measures don't work very well, says
Richard Sullivan, pointing to the Sept. 11 terror attacks on New York and
   He's says he's got a better idea: a microchip instead of a green card.
Foreigners who pass through customs or immigration could be injected with
the chip, allowing officials to monitor their activities better and keep
terrorists out.
   "Man today is more than ever converging with technology," said
Sullivan, who is CEO of the Palm Beach-based tech company Applied Digital
Solutions (Nasdaq: ADSX, 45 cents). "I think the positives overwhelmingly
overcome any small negatives. The government is more prepared, for the
overall benefit of our citizens, to advocate some of these changes."
   Sullivan's company has high hopes for the implantable technology, which
it unveiled Wednesday. Until now, the microchips -- called VeriChips --
have been used for tracking and identifying animals.
   Applied Digital has had a patent for such devices since 1999. The new
technology would make Applied Digital the first company in the nation to
sell microchips designed to be implanted in human beings.
   But privacy groups reacted with outrage Wednesday to Sullivan's idea
for monitoring foreigners. America is not that desperate, one group said,
citing a violation of "bodily integrity."
   "That is so unconstitutional," said Randall Marshall, legal director
for the Miami chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. "I can't
imagine this surviving a constitutional challenge. It just simply goes way
too far outside the realm of what we believe in as a society."
   Sullivan said the product will be marketed in January in South America
while the company seeks approval in the United States from the Food and
Drug Administration. Approval is expected in 18 months.
   A New Jersey surgeon who serves on the board of Owings, Md.-based
Medical Advisory Systems, which is about to combine with a subsidiary of
Applied Digital, injected himself with two of the VeriChips five days
after the terror attacks.
   Richard Seelig inserted the chips in his forearm and hip as part of the
clinical process Applied Digital will have to conduct to receive FDA
approval, Sullivan said. Seelig, 55, referred all questions Wednesday to
Sullivan but told the Los Angeles Times he felt compelled to have a secure
form of identification after Sept. 11.
   "I was so compelled by what had happened," Seelig told the Times. "One
of the potential applications suddenly jumped out -- the ability to have a
secure form of identification -- and I felt I had to take the next step."
   The chips are about the size of a grain of rice and contain an
identification number or other data, such as medical information, and a
person's address and phone number.
   The chips have no internal power source. Their data can't be read
without a scanner close at hand. The next generation of body chips -- one
that transmits signals from a distance -- is several years away.
   The chip is the same as the one Applied Digital's subsidiary uses in
more than 1 million animals, but the VeriChip can be used in humans with a
pacemaker, artificial heart valves or orthopedic knee devices. If a
patient needs help, a hospital can use a scanner to obtain information.
   In five years, Sullivan said he can see the chips being used in
children, the elderly, prisoners, and by employers at facilities such as
airports and nuclear plants. Society in general could use them instead of
ATM or credit cards, he said.
   But Evan Hendricks, editor and publisher of Privacy Times, a
Washington, D.C.-based newsletter, said it's one thing for an individual
to choose to implant the device for medical purposes, but it's crossing
the line when parents start putting them in their children or employers
require them for employment.
   "This has been science fiction for most of our adult life, but now we
see the technology allows it," Hendricks said. "The problem is that it is
happening in a vacuum where there are not adequate privacy laws."

The crime of distributed computing
By Ann Harrison
Posted: 20/12/2001 at 17:33 GMT
A college computer technician who offered his school's unused computer
processing power for an encryption research project will be tried next
month in Georgia for computer theft and trespassing charges that carry a
potential total of 120 years in jail. The closely-watched case if one of the first in which state prosecutors
have lodged felony charges for allegedly downloading third-party software
without permission. David McOwen was working as a PC specialist at the state-run DeKalb
Technical Institute in 1998, when he learned about a project by the
non-profit organization distributed.net that allowed computer users to
donate their unused processing power to test the RC5 encryption algorithm.
Noticing that many of the machines he maintained on the seven DeKalb
campuses sat idle for long periods, McOwen installed distributed.net
clients at several of those locations while performing a Y2K upgrade on
the machines in 1999. According to McOwen, during the Christmas holidays in 1999 school
administrators noticed that unused machines were sending and receiving the
distributed.net data -- about the equivalent of one email a day. The
school sent McOwen a letter of suspension in January of 2000, without
specifying a grievance, and McOwen resigned shortly afterwards, believing
that he had put the incident behind him. Instead, in June of 2001 McOwen was contacted by an investigator from the
Georgia Bureau of Investigation who informed him that he was the subject
of an 18-month computer crime investigation. In October, prosecutors from
the Georgia state attorney general's office charged McOwen with eight
violations of Georgia's tough computer crime law: one count of computer
theft, and seven counts of computer trespass -- one for each of the school
offices where McOwen downloaded the distributed.net client. Each felony count carries a $50,000 fine and a 15-year possible prison
term, for a 120 year maximum possible sentence. The indictment also calls
for restitution equal to the amount of money paid to state workers to
uninstall the programs from 500 PCs. As the case nears trial, it's raising eyebrows among some legal and
technology experts for the unusual application of an anti-hacking law to
actions taken by a network's legitimate administrator. 'This Is Not Hacking' "Our problem with this kind of statute is that it is written in such broad
terms that it can reach all sorts of behavior that doesn't constitute
computer fraud, but can give the government prosecutorial discretion,"
says Lee Tien, a senior staff attorney with the San Francisco-based
Electronic Frontier Foundation, who has followed McOwen's case. "This is a hacking statute," says McOwen, "but obviously this is not
hacking." At an early stage in the proceedings, prosecutors claimed that
McOwen had cost the state of Georgia $415,000 in bandwidth charges, based
on a calculation that the distributed.net clients consumed precisely 59
cents worth of bandwidth per second. The state has since backed away from
the $415,000 figure. Today, much of the case rests on whether McOwen violated DeKalb's policies
by downloading the distributed.net client. Russ Willard, a spokesman for
Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker, contends that McOwen deliberately
ignored the college's written computer usage guidelines, which were issued
to him with his first user I.D. and password. Willard says the policy
forbade McOwen from downloading any unauthorized third-party software onto
the college's machines. McOwen claims he had permission from college officials to download the
software, and his lawyer suggests that there were no written guidelines
forbidding such installations to begin with. "If there is a policy I have
not seen it," says attorney David Joyner, who says he has received all the
discovery evidence in the case. DeKalb college president Paul Starnes and
McOwen's supervisors from the college's IS department would not comment on
the case. Even if there was such a policy presented to McOwen, those who work at
universities say they are often disregarded. "It think it's so common on
the academic community that nobody reads agreements like that," says David
Farber, a professor of telecommunications at the University of
Pennsylvania and former chief technologist of the FCC. "It is part and
parcel of many academics and many students that inquisitiveness motivates
them to download third-party software. If you are going to prosecute a
person for that on those grounds, than you should prosecute everybody on
campus because everyone has done it." Financial Motive Alleged Willard says that McOwen was singled out for prosecution partly because he
had ignored his supervisor's warnings. "In this case, Mr. McOwen was
expressively prohibited by his superiors from downloading these programs
and was informed on many occasions by his supervisors to stop downloading
programs," said Willard. "They were aware that he was doing it and he had
gone in and cleaned it up on numerous occasions." Joyner insists McOwen
received no such warning. Prosecutors also claim that McOwen had a financial motive for volunteering
the school's machines. McOwen was a top producer on distributed.net for
"Team AnandTech," a group sponsored by a hardware forum site which is
still the second ranking contributor to the RC5 research project. A $1,000
prize goes to the individual contributor who recovers the RC5 encryption
key. "McOwen placed a program on computers, that in his estimation would
benefit him personally, including computers that has sensitive student
financial and identity information without authorization," says Willard.
"There is concern about the program itself compromising or providing the
basis to compromise sensitive personal or financial information, there is
the matter of Mr. McOwen's unauthorized activities on this computer, and
finally there is the point that there was misappropriation of state
property." McOwen says the prize money wasn't a factor. "People do these projects for
the betterment of mankind," says McOwen. "You are not doing it for the
prize and possibility of money, you are doing it because it is the right
thing to do." "I think the prosecutor's office needs some lessons in computer science,"
says Farber. "If you want to make a point, there are much better examples
than this guy." The case is set for trial on 28 January. © 2001 SecurityFocus.com, all rights reserved.

More on the Isreal spy ring in the USA.
NEWSMAX REPORTS:
The discovery of a major spy ring inside the United States is straining the already tense relations with Israel. Although, Israel denied any involvement with the penetration of the U.S. wiretap system, the CIA and FBI are investigating the direct government ties to the former Israeli military and intelligence officials now being held by the Justice Department.
One major drug bust operation planned by the Los Angeles police was foiled by what now appear to be reverse wiretaps placed on law enforcement phones by the criminal spy ring.

Enough already! Ban programming.
@ Articles     Dec 16 2001 - 02:54 EST   No I don't agree with or endorse in any way this statement, but to anyone
who would like an insight into the minds (often closed minds) of the
general public who have been manipulated by the mass media into almost
decleration of war on Hackers and other such sub-cultures of hacking. This article is from Adequacy.org and as such copyright and the rest of
it. Programming computers is, for practically everyone, something done far
away in exotic software engineering facilities by a priesthood of
ultra-specialized, half-mad obsessive-compulsives. This is as it should
be, and it is where we get the software we use every day to do our online
banking, send email, and get productive work done. Though few normal
people have any experience of it, or know anyone who does it, there is
another kind of programming performed outside this legitimate sphere, one
that you probably assumed was illegal, but shockingly, is not. This other kind of programming also affects us every day, but negatively,
as a continuous series of massive disruptions to the worldwide economy in
the form of viruses, in the form of important and useful computer services
being sabotaged with denial-of-service, in the form of defacement attacks,
and in the form of substantially higher prices for all sorts of
intellectual property such as software, DVD movies and music on CD, all
due to piracy. I'm talking about "hacking" of course. It is the evil dark
side to all the good that computers have brought us, and we are all sick
of it. The time has come to put a stop to "hacking", because we can no
longer tolerate the damage "hackers" cause, and the potential risk of
terrorism when, not if, "hackers" go to work for such forces of mayhem as
have begun an onslaught of terror against not just the United States, but
Western Civilization's freedom to be loose and decadent in general. For a time, our society tolerated "hackers" because they promised that
something useful would come of their shady and secretive tinkering. Yet we
have had nothing but a harvest of bitter fruit from "hackers", and it is
now time to pull the plug. It is time to ban all unlicensed computer
programming, and take steps to ensure that no one outside of government,
select universities, and state-sanctioned private-sector corporate
software engineering facilities is given the knowledge, skills, or means
to write or compile computer code of any kind. Amateur or hobbyist
computer programming has grown from a minor annoyance to a major social
disease, and it simply can no longer be tolerated. Although ordinary decent people will find this suggestion to be obvious to
the point of banality -- in fact, I'm sure many of you are surprised that
amateur computer programming was ever legal! -- many of those who
associate themselves with the "hacker community" will bridle at the
suggestion. Strictly as an exercise, it would perhaps be diverting to
entertain some of their more obvious objections. The first cry in defense of hobbyists toying with this dangerous
technology is that hackers have already proven their worth by producing a
valuable piece of software -- namely, the Apache web server. Others would
even claim that more than one useful program has been written in the
garages and and lonely bedrooms of hobbyists. There are two delusions at
work here. One of these delusions is that any of the Open Source applications that
have found some utility in business and industry were written by amateurs.
The truth is that Apache began it's life as the work of professional
coders employed by Amazon.com, and as any software engineer you want to
ask can tell you, nothing of value was added by anyone but professionals.
In truth, the work of the gainfully employed programmers on this project
was often interrupted and even sabotaged by the ham-fisted meddling of the
teenage wanna-be's and self-styled "gurus" who have accumulated around
professional Open Source projects like so many leeches and barnacles. This
episode alone demonstrates that if there is anything good to come out of
Open Source methodology, it will only be helped along by the removal of
dilettantes from the picture. Indeed, once the "hackers" have been
outlawed, Open Source will very likely reach new heights of utility and
quality, and perhaps even fulfill the promise of greatness that Open
Source advocates have been making for years. The other delusion, or I should say piece of misinformation, that has been
perpetrated by "hackers" is that there are many other "tools" that have
been created by hackers and gifted to a grateful world by our benevolent
hobbyists. What about Emacs, for example? What about it? Emacs was
originally created at MIT, a trusted part of the US military research
establishment. Obviously, such facilities and their (suitably cleared)
employees will never be banned. The time has come to ban the reckless
tourists from the programming field, not legitimate university
researchers. It is true that Emacs, and similar tools have subsequently
been "enhanced" by "hackers". Generally, we have seen a pattern of
mind-boggling feature creep and software bloat as a result of this. Emacs,
for all its admirers, is the worst known example of this. In addition, all
of the "functionality" that has been added to Emacs, or other "tools"
touted by free software hackers such as Flex, Bison, gcc, etc. are
hacker's tools. That means that they are like lock picks or zip guns. They
have no inherent functionality that is not ultimately malevolent and
illegal in its purpose. This is not utility or service. This is
disservice. The reason that hobbyists work so feverishly hard on creating this kind of
tool is precisely because they are locked out of the world of the normal,
decent software engineer, where professional-grade IDEs, debuggers, and
similar tools are abundant. Those with ultimately criminal intent must
cobble together their own weapons. There are dozens, even hundreds of
these types of destructive programs in circulation, such as those
mentioned, as well as the notorious "Back Orifice", or the hacker
operating system, "Lunix". While a "hacker" could disingenuously and
spuriously argue that each one of these various illegal programs has some
redeeming social value, it is clear that taken as a whole, such "warez" do
not in fact benefit anyone except "hackers" and other criminals. Rather than waste any more time tediously demonstrating this fact for each
of these "hacker's" tools, it would be best to move on to the other canard
that "hackers" raise in defense of their "freedom" to "hack". And that
would be freedom itself. Is there a right to "hack"? Well, of course there
most certainly is not. Is there a right to build atomic bombs or breed
anthrax bacilli in one's back yard? Is there a right to spy on your
government and pass on that information to our foreign enemies, merely
because you have chosen espionage as a "hobby"? Perhaps you could claim
that your interest in espionage is driven by an innate curiosity, a desire
to discover new things and understand how the world works. And so what?
Such apologetics are amusing coming from children, but to hear an adult
make such excuses is not funny at all. It is merely sad. Few precocious adolescent "hackers" are capable of understanding why
responsible nations must ban "hacking", but as adults we can all recognize
that these apologetics for hobbyist "hacking" carry no weight at all, and
so we must do what is right. If you style yourself a "hacker" and you
really want to play around with dangerous toys, be it source code,
fissionable material, or biotoxins, then you have only one route open to
you: go to college and prove that you really have the mental horsepower to
cut the mustard, and prove also that you are a loyal patriot who can be
trusted with potentially deadly power. Then, and only then, will a decent
society trust you with the secrets of our most awesome technology. Those
too impatient to wait, too dull to get into a university, and too flaky to
get security clearance due to low character, drug abuse, and trafficking
with unsavory characters are simply out of luck. And it's a good thing
too. Is it practical to ban "hacking" now? Absolutely. There is no better time than now. As we have seen by the
recent mass murders by terrorists, computer technology is a mainstay of
criminals, and they rely most on such "free" tools as text editors and
military-grade encryption programs that "hackers" use simply because they
think it is cute to play with such power. But the rest of society has lost
patience with this childish diddling, and the civilized world has said
unequivocally that we want strong legal safeguards enacted to put an end
to "hacking" and terrorism. We most especially have no qualms about
banning activities like playing with explosives or creating software when
these so-called "hobbies" are restricted to a tiny fringe element who for
whatever reason gets no pleasure from healthy pastimes like fly fishing or
drinking alcohol at gentlemen's clubs. Put simply, normal folks are not going to let themselves get blown up
because a tiny minority of freaks like to "hack". If you aren't willing to
code for Uncle Sam, then don't code at all. Author's note: Since it is likely that many so-called g**ks or "hackers"
will read this article and will perhaps become angry about it, and then,
typically, lose control of their anger, I want to this opportunity to ask
them to please refrain from attacking Adequacy.org in retaliation. Though
you might disagree with an opinion that you read, that is no reason to
launch a denial of service attack against the medium. Please use your
reason and, if you feel strongly, engage in a polite dialogue, rather than
acting out your anger with illegal "hacking" attacks. Thank you for not
attacking this web site.

Found this over on GeekNews, pointing to a story over on New Order,
regarding some additional information in relation to the FBI's ongoing warez
The FBI has, in the past week, been involved in raids against WAREZ groups,
including 90+ scene group senior members and leaders in US, Canada, Britain,
Australia, Norway, 2 cracking groups in Poland. New raids are expected in
the next days or so..
Now We've got confirmed insider information, that four major efnet servers
are currently running in debug mode, which enables them to see ALL private
traffic, like private chat, passwords sent to channel protection bots,
messages, etc. and the information is being filtered and sent to the FBI,
which requested this. Currently, a big EDU server, and .ORG server.

@_subject: IRS Agent Goes Berserk, Assaults Citizen, by Pat Shannan 
Sent: Monday, December 17, 2001 11:42 AM
Long Live the Republic, Death to the new world order!
IRS Agent Goes Berserk, Assaults Citizen Local Cops, Sheriff Refuse to
by Pat Shannan Dec. 2001
A sign spotted recently over the door of one IRS office says: "Seizure
Fever ­ Catch It!" Word has it that the IRS agent with the best seizure
rate for the week is rewarded with a brief respite and other job "perks."
Apparently the pressure to hit his weekly plunder bonus was more than one
revenuer could stand, and when he was asked to show the law justifying his
actions, he blew a head gasket.
The Oct. 2 incident occurred when Wiley Davis, an IRS Team Manager from
Colorado, became agitated with Las Vegas resident Ken Nicholson, 37, during
a hearing to discuss an IRS lien against some property owned by Nicholson's
friend, Keith Milbourn. Davis, 45, had been brought in from Denver
specifically for the Milbourn case.
The Las Vegas Tribune first reported the altercation as arising from a tax
dispute involving an IRS lien against some property belonging to Ken
Nicholson. This was inaccurate. Nicholson had gone along as counsel for his
friends, Keith and Shawna Milbourn, and as a witness to the proceedings. It
was Milbourn's case that was in dispute. They had also taken along court
reporter Beatrice Conner, who caught the whole incident on audiotape.
Nicholson had Power of Attorney to speak for Milbourn, 32. Davis was
assisted by a female agent. Throughout the hearing, the two men made it
clear that they were not going to take Davis' word for anything and would
need actual documentation to prove the IRS' stand. Finally, Nicholson said
that they would be willing to pay whatever the IRS claimed Milbourn owed if
Davis could:
1) Produce a Notice and Demand for the tax; and
2) Give a Code Section which made Milbourn liable.
Nicholson said, and witnesses as well as the tape recording concur, that
Davis did not attempt to produce that evidence but instead became visibly
angry, lost his self-control and attacked Nicholson.
Offense is the Best Defense
"Out of nowhere," said Nicholson, "he jumped up out of his chair and came
around the table, grabbed my chair, and began bouncing it up and down. He
shoved it forward and pushed me toward the table. [In the process,] my legs
came apart and were straddling the arm of the chair. With three or four
quick jerks, he yanked the arm of the chair upward and into my groin. Then
he grabbed me and began to physically evict me from the room."
Security officers came in and stopped the melee at the Oakley Boulevard
office of the IRS in Las Vegas.
Court stenographer Beatrice Conner was shocked speechless when Nicholson
was knocked to the floor. "It was totally without provocation," she said.
"He (Davis) was so angry and violent that if he had had a gun, he would
have pulled it out!"
Keith Milbourn, who witnessed the whole meeting and scuffle, gave more
"By the time we called the police there were about ten people in the
hallway including other agents, the witnesses and security guards,"
Milbourn told us, adding that the other IRS agent who was in the room,
Renee Swells, was "surprised and shocked" by Davis' action. Swells was
unavailable for comment.
Milbourn and Nicholson had called 911 "and the cops arrived in five minutes
all gung-ho and ready to arrest Ken. However, when they heard the tape
played back, they all fell silent, not knowing what to do."
So the officers did nothing. No arrest was made.
Both men said they tried to report the incident to the U.S. attorney's
office, as well as the FBI, but both Justice Department entities declined

When the Metro police came out, Nicholson gave a voluntary statement backed
up by his witnesses and the tape recording. He was told that he would have
to wait five days before the report would be actually recorded in the
police records.
"On the sixth day, I went in and found out that no police report had been
made at all. When I demanded that the report be filed and made official, I
was told that I had a statute of limitations of five days to ask and demand
prosecution from the date of the incident and that now I was too late."
In other words, Nicholson was hoodwinked by officialdom. A spokesman for
the Las Vegas Police Department said that investigators informed Nicholson
he had to contact the department within five days of the incident if he
wanted to initiate action against Davis, since it was "just a misdemeanor
battery." LVMPD officials are sticking to their story that Nicholson had
not contacted the department seeking action against Davis.
The spokesman also said the department gave all of the information to the
IRS Criminal Investigation Division. No announcement has been forthcoming
as to whether Davis has been terminated, placed on leave pending an
investigation, or is being held for psychiatric observation.
"If Nicholson wants prosecution, he can contact the general investigations
division within the department and they can move forward on it," the
unnamed spokesman added. However, the frustrations of not seeing any
justice in the criminal courts have motivated Nicholson toward a civil

Special Report: America Responds
By ABRAHAM McLAUGHLIN, Christian Science Monitor
WASHINGTON (December 17, 2001 12:09 p.m. EST) - The Central Intelligence
Agency has been given new freedom to get involved in domestic surveillance
and investigations in ways that are unprecedented in its history.
The CIA's intelligence gathering has long been kept as separate as possible
from domestic law enforcement, which is bound by strict evidence-gathering
rules and legal safeguards protecting the rights of those investigated.
But as the nation girds itself against global terrorism carried out on
American soil, the barriers between covert, stealthy intelligence and
by-the-book domestic law enforcement investigations are beginning to melt.
Suddenly, for instance, the CIA will now have access to testimony collected
by federal grand juries.
And the CIA, FBI, and other federal agencies are, for the first time, being
allowed to share vast amounts of information ranging from phone records and
credit cards statements to profiles of suspected terrorists.
These shrinking restraints come as new anti-terrorism legislation adopted
this fall grants the FBI far broader wiretapping and other investigative
And while many see the new cooperation as essential in combating the
enormous threat, for others it raises civil-liberties concerns - and
resurrects dark memories of CIA monitoring of domestic groups, including
1970s anti-war protesters.
Those domestic intrusions drove Congress and the president to tighten
restrictions dating back to the 1947 creation of the CIA that bar the agency
from any "domestic police function."
"Traditionally, there's been a sharp demarcation between FBI and CIA turf
... but now there's more ambiguity," says Loch Johnson, author of "America's
Secret Power: The CIA in a Democratic Society."
One of the most-significant changes is the CIA and other government
agencies' new access to one of the most powerful domestic investigative
tools - federal grand-jury proceedings - under the USA Patriot Act, which
passed in the wake of Sept. 11. Now, if any grand-jury investigation
involves matters of "foreign intelligence or counterintelligence" its fruits
may be shared with relevant federal agencies, the statute reads.
"That's a big change in criminal law," notes Robert Davis, founder of the
University of Mississippi's Journal of National Security Law.
Critics worry that "foreign intelligence" information is a very broad
category that extends far beyond just fighting terrorism. They also worry
the information flow won't just be one way. Instead, the CIA may eventually
suggest certain avenues for investigation.
Defenders of the change argue prosecutors will be zealous about defending
their grand-jury proceedings from outside interference.
What really worries critics is the CIA's past history of domestic
operations. In the '60s and '70s, for instance, Operation CHAOS included CIA
involvement in spying on U.S. citizens including anti-war protesters, black
militant groups and even congressmen.
President Nixon's White House encouraged these activities, convinced that
foreign powers stood behind anti-war radicals.
Yet advocates of the changes say the present threats on American soil differ
significantly from the domestic snooping conducted by the Nixon
In fact, supporters point out that drastic government measures - such as
Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War - have
typically been temporary. Indeed, the most-controversial elements of the USA
Patriot Act do eventually expire.
In the meantime, the stepped-up cooperation is crucial, says Gates, who
argues the relevant historical parallel is not Operation CHAOS but Pearl
In 1941 - as in 2001 - "disparate government agencies had bits of
information" that pointed to an attack.
"But there was no single agency to pull everything together in a coherent
analysis of the threat," Gates says.
The new information sharing is the only way to prepare against new attacks.
The USA Patriot act allows the CIA, FBI, the Border Patrol, and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to share information broadly. And
it's likely to lead to FBI and CIA agents working closely together here in
the U.S.
This greater cooperation comes at a time of significantly increased federal
investigation powers. For instance, under the PATRIOT act, law enforcement
can now more easily conduct secret searches of homes and businesses, while a
change to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act makes it easier for law
enforcement to obtain wiretaps.
Such activity may help prevent future terrorist acts. But there is also
concern that it will lead to a blending of the intelligence and
law-enforcement cultures.
Yet there are hints it won't be so easy for the two agencies to work
together, given the history of antagonism between the two and the CIA's
reluctance to repeat its past mistakes.
Somehow, experts say, the agencies must strike a tricky balance. "The
concept of keeping them separate makes good sense in general," says
University of Virginia law professor John Norton Moore. But after Sept. 11,
"it's inconceivable not to have the two talking to each other."

Reply-To: spynews-owner
Bush administration seeks to relax curbs on FBI domestic spying
By Kate Randall
18 December 2001
Attorney General John Ashcroft is considering relaxing restrictions on the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that limit spying on political
organizations, churches and other groups in the United States. If put into
effect, the change in FBI rules would constitute a fundamental loosening of
curbs on the agencys domestic intelligence operations, and would allow the
government to spy on groups and individuals solely because of their
political beliefs.
Ashcroft said the proposed change is part of the effort to shift the axis of
Justice Department activity from the prosecution of crime to the prevention
of terrorism. In the wake of the September 11 events, the Bush
administration has issued a rash of executive orders that attack basic
democratic rights and challenge civil liberties long protected by the US
Constitution. These orders have included the authorization of secret
military tribunals to try alleged terrorists; the roundup of more than a
thousand mainly Middle Eastern men, some of them detained indefinitely and
in secret; and the authorization of eavesdropping on attorney-client
conversations of those in custody.
The new Justice Department proposal poses a particular threat to the civil
liberties of any individual or political organization that opposes the
domestic or foreign policy of the government. The loosening of restrictions
would allow the FBI to spy on groups or individualsincluding the use of
roving wiretaps and e-mail surveillancewithout providing a judge with
proof of probable cause. Presently, meetings of political groups, services
at mosques or churches and other private gatherings are off-limits to the
FBI unless it can prove the likelihood that a crime is in progress.
Widespread domestic spying was carried out in the 1960s and 70s as part of
the FBIs notorious COINTELPRO (counter-intelligence program) operation.
Under then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, COINTELPRO targeted black
nationalists, civil rights activists and opponents of the Vietnam War. Those
under surveillance included boxer Muhammad Ali, actress Jane Fonda, Dr.
Benjamin Spock, Dr. Martin Luther King and the Black Panther Party, among
many others.
The FBI carried out a vicious campaign for almost 20 years against opponents
of government policy, utilizing such methods as illegal wiretaps, blackmail
and forgery, extortion and in some cases outright murder. FBI agents were
also involved in incitement to violence in their work in racist
organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan.
When the FBIs widespread surveillance methods began to be exposed in the
1970s, Congress was obliged to carry out an investigation into the agencys
spying activities and methods. In the wake of this probe, the bureau adopted
internal guidelines prohibiting agents from using charges of subversion or
the threat of terrorism to justify the monitoring of Americans political
activities. Ashcroft now wants to rewrite the FBI code of conduct to allow
the agency to resume spying on its domestic political opponents.
COINTELPROs dirty record
An examination of two COINTELPRO cases makes clear the ominous implications
of Ashcrofts proposal, and the dangers posed to democratic rights by the
revival of these methods.
One of the most infamous cases of FBI infiltration was in connection with
the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama,
which left four young girls dead and injured another 22 adults and children.
The racially motivated bombing was the twenty-first in eight years and the
third in only 11 days, following federal orders to integrate the citys
public schools.
As early as 1964, FBI agents in the KKK identified four men in the 16th
Street Church bombing. However FBI Director Hoover, a fervent opponent of
civil rights, blocked their prosecution. The case was eventually shut down
in 1968 with no charges being filed against the KKK members.
The FBI maintained its network of agents inside the Birmingham KKK following
the bombing, including one of its most notorious informants, Gary T. Rowe,
who later admitted to involvement in violent assaults on blacks. These
included the 1961 attack on Freedom Riders at the Birmingham bus station and
the 1965 murder of Viola Liuzzo, a 39-year-old civil rights activist from
Detroit. The Justice Department later acknowledged it had known about Rowes
connection to these racist attacks, but claimed it had no evidence linking
him to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing.
The FBI finally reopened the case in 1996, leading to the indictment in 2000
of two KKK members, Thomas Blanton and Bobby Cherry, on first-degree and
reckless murder charges. Cherry was ruled mentally incompetent to stand
trial, but Blanton was finally convicted last May of four counts of
first-degree murder.
Another COINTELPRO case involved FBI infiltration of the Black Panther
Party. Elmer Geronimo Pratt was arrested and charged with the
kidnap-murder of Los Angeles schoolteacher Caroline Olsen. Olsen and her
husband were attacked on a tennis court in Santa Monica, California in 1968
by two black men; she was abducted and killed. Her husband Kenneth
identified Pratt as one of the assailants three years later from a photo
provided by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD).
Geronimo Pratt was framed up as part of the FBI vendetta against the Black
Panthers. The main witness against him was Julius Butler, who had functioned
as an informant for both the FBI and LAPD inside the Panthers. Butler had
been expelled from the group by Pratt because he advocated violence.
At trial, Butler testified that Pratt had confessed to the murder of
Caroline Olsen. The FBI closed its file on Butler during the trial so that
he could deny being an informer when questioned. He resumed his informing
activities after the trial. Pratt was convicted of kidnapping and murder in
1972 and served 27 years in jail for a crime he did not commit before
finally being released in 1999. A Superior Court judge in California ruled
that his conviction should be overturned due to misconduct by the Los
Angeles district attorneys office.
These two cases give only a glimpse of the types of domestic
counterintelligence methods the Bush administration now wants to revive. As
with the majority of provisions enacted since September 11 in the name of
the war on terrorismmost of them by executive fiatthey pose a threat to
the civil liberties not only of alleged terrorists but the American
population as a whole.
The proposed change in spying guidelines would mean political groups could
be targeted for surveillance simply because the government designates them
as subversive due to their political views. Such groups could include
left-wing or socialist parties, workers organizations, civil rights
advocates or anyone who speaks out against government policy.
Former FBI Director Louis Freeh gave an indication of what types of
organizations could be targeted for accelerated domestic spying as a result
of relaxed regulations on the FBI. In speech on May 10, 2001, Freeh said,
Domestic terrorist groups represent interests that span the full spectrum
of political and economic viewpoints, as well as social issues and
 concerns.
The former FBI chief included in his list of groups that could be designated
as terrorist by the government Anarchists and extremist socialist
groupsmany of which, such as the Workers World Party, Reclaim the Streets
and Carnival Against Capitalismhave an international presence and, at
times, also represent a potential threat in the United States.

@_subject: FBI Surveillance Software to be Part of Windows XP Updates (fwd) 
Microsoft, cDc and FBI Cut a Deal: FBI Surveillance Software to be Part of Windows XP Updates By John Robbington
The controversy, rumours and speculation surrounding the FBI's Magic
Lantern tool has attracted ridicule from the internet underground.
Not so any more. Now both the infamous hacker group the Cult of the Dead
Cow (cDc) and Microsoft have offered a helping hand to the Feds and are
preparing to include the surveillance software in all future editions and
updates of the new Microsoft Windows XP operating system.
"This Magic Lantern could easily become a part of Windows XP Dynamic
Updates, or even become a standard part of the operating system."  Microsoft spokesperson Bob Null said. "We are really looking forward to
experimenting this on a large scale. Our direct Marketing department was
jumping out of their pants when they heard we would be doing this." As
well they should. - The dreams of both direct marketers and FBI agents
coming true at the same time.
Also to be included in the future Microsoft Windows XP (R) are
Microsoft's trademark profiling software meant for tracking individual
See: Microsoft licenses profiling software for digital TV
Microsoft's New Technology enables the FBI to profile individuals through their browsing and typing habits and so provide FBI with useful information about potential terrorists and other criminals.
Both Microsoft and FBI point out that individual profiles are
not given a name and that the information is stored on the FBI
government computers only and not on public computers. But this holds little sway with privacy advocates.
Predictive, a Microsoft partner in this venture, has also filed a patent
for a biometric system which identifies different individuals within the
same household.
The system works on recognising people's keystroke, mouse or
remote-control usage patterns. It says that it generates random, perfect
IDs each time, which have the effect of identifying all the household's PC
users, even if they didn't write anything that would otherwise indicate
to FBI and Microsoft who is using the computer.
Andy Beers, senior product manager for Microsoft said of the deal:
"Predictive Networks' solutions will provide customers of Microsoft
with state-of-the-art software to understand suspected terrorists'
characteristics and interests. The result will be the technology and
expertise needed to make thought police operation a seamless reality
for the consumer, while enabling the incremental criminalization and hunts for file swapping terrorist within the United States and
Evidently still grizzled about the fact that their security is
too bad to afford any real protection, Microsoft has withheld the publishing of a notorious security track record, that of Microsoft
being the most often penetrated OS of the Millennium.
Reid Fleming, a cDc member and now a secret Microsoft employee, said:
"Never before has the US faced a more troublesome enemy. To meet this
growing challenge of fileswap terrorism, the FBI has announced an
ongoing effort to create and deploy best-of-breed electronic surveillance
"While we applaud the innovation and drive of the federal law
enforcement agency, those of us who are US citizens would be remiss
if we did not offer our expertise in this area."
A tongue in cheek announcement from the group claims that cDc "has
more targeted experience than anyone else in this field".
And they're right. Their Back Orifice would do the Magic Lantern job
beautifully. Although the hackers are quite confident that the Microsoft
and FBI's Engineering Research Facility is more than capable, cDc intends
to re-architect Back Orifice from the ground up.
"There will be absolutely no shared code between the two projects, in
order to skirt detection by commercial antivirus packages. The code
will remain totally secret. The software will never surface publicly.  And it will be far more stealthy than anything we have ever released,
demonstrated or publicly discussed," the group said.
Indeed, the central design principle of Magic Lantern and this new
breed of Back Orifice could easily be interpreted as "an artificial
witness which is capable of intercepting any and all relevant activity
during, after and even leading up to the commission of a computer
crime", it added.
The cDc concluded that the project would deliver "the ultimate
intelligence gathering tool to the govenrment. And we intend to construct
it, at no cost, exclusively for the use of Microsoft and the federal
government," said Fleming.
"We are confident that Microsoft and the government will limit the use of
this technology only to targets relevant to legitimate investigations," he
added, further underscoring the cult's faith in federal law enforcement
organisations. "The FBI has a long history of following Title 18 to the

Rare lynx hairs found in forests exposed as hoax
   By Audrey Hudson
   THE WASHINGTON TIMES
        Federal and state wildlife biologists planted false evidence of a
   rare cat species in two national forests, officials told The
   Washington Times.
        Had the deception not been discovered, the government likely
   would have banned many forms of recreation and use of natural
   resources in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and Wenatchee
   National Forest in Washington state.
        The previously unreported Forest Service investigation found that
   the science of the habitat study had been skewed by seven government
   officials: three Forest Service employees, two U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service officials and two employees of the Washington Department of
   Fish and Wildlife.
        The officials planted three separate samples of Canadian lynx
   hair on rubbing posts used to identify existence of the creatures in
   the two national forests.
        DNA testing of two of the samples matched that of a lynx living
   inside an animal preserve. The third DNA sample matched that of an
   escaped pet lynx being held in a federal office until its owner
   retrieved it, federal officials said.

Long Live the Republic, Death to the new world order!
IRS Agent Goes Berserk, Assaults Citizen Local Cops, Sheriff Refuse to
by Pat Shannan Dec. 2001
A sign spotted recently over the door of one IRS office says: "Seizure
Fever ­ Catch It!" Word has it that the IRS agent with the best seizure
rate for the week is rewarded with a brief respite and other job "perks."
Apparently the pressure to hit his weekly plunder bonus was more than one
revenuer could stand, and when he was asked to show the law justifying his
actions, he blew a head gasket.
The Oct. 2 incident occurred when Wiley Davis, an IRS Team Manager from
Colorado, became agitated with Las Vegas resident Ken Nicholson, 37, during
a hearing to discuss an IRS lien against some property owned by Nicholson's
friend, Keith Milbourn. Davis, 45, had been brought in from Denver
specifically for the Milbourn case.
The Las Vegas Tribune first reported the altercation as arising from a tax
dispute involving an IRS lien against some property belonging to Ken
Nicholson. This was inaccurate. Nicholson had gone along as counsel for his
friends, Keith and Shawna Milbourn, and as a witness to the proceedings. It
was Milbourn's case that was in dispute. They had also taken along court
reporter Beatrice Conner, who caught the whole incident on audiotape.
Nicholson had Power of Attorney to speak for Milbourn, 32. Davis was
assisted by a female agent. Throughout the hearing, the two men made it
clear that they were not going to take Davis' word for anything and would
need actual documentation to prove the IRS' stand. Finally, Nicholson said
that they would be willing to pay whatever the IRS claimed Milbourn owed if
Davis could:
1) Produce a Notice and Demand for the tax; and
2) Give a Code Section which made Milbourn liable.
Nicholson said, and witnesses as well as the tape recording concur, that
Davis did not attempt to produce that evidence but instead became visibly
angry, lost his self-control and attacked Nicholson.
Offense is the Best Defense
"Out of nowhere," said Nicholson, "he jumped up out of his chair and came
around the table, grabbed my chair, and began bouncing it up and down. He
shoved it forward and pushed me toward the table. [In the process,] my legs
came apart and were straddling the arm of the chair. With three or four
quick jerks, he yanked the arm of the chair upward and into my groin. Then
he grabbed me and began to physically evict me from the room."
Security officers came in and stopped the melee at the Oakley Boulevard
office of the IRS in Las Vegas.
Court stenographer Beatrice Conner was shocked speechless when Nicholson
was knocked to the floor. "It was totally without provocation," she said.
"He (Davis) was so angry and violent that if he had had a gun, he would
have pulled it out!"
Keith Milbourn, who witnessed the whole meeting and scuffle, gave more
"By the time we called the police there were about ten people in the
hallway including other agents, the witnesses and security guards,"
Milbourn told us, adding that the other IRS agent who was in the room,
Renee Swells, was "surprised and shocked" by Davis' action. Swells was
unavailable for comment.
Milbourn and Nicholson had called 911 "and the cops arrived in five minutes
all gung-ho and ready to arrest Ken. However, when they heard the tape
played back, they all fell silent, not knowing what to do."
So the officers did nothing. No arrest was made.
Both men said they tried to report the incident to the U.S. attorney's
office, as well as the FBI, but both Justice Department entities declined
to take their report. The same proved to be true at the county level with
Sheriff Jerry Keller.
"I know that if I would have assaulted the IRS agent, I would be sitting in
jail right now," Nicholson said. "But because the IRS agent is the one who
assaulted me, Metro [Las Vegas Police] only took a statement and let him

When the Metro police came out, Nicholson gave a voluntary statement backed
up by his witnesses and the tape recording. He was told that he would have
to wait five days before the report would be actually recorded in the
police records.
"On the sixth day, I went in and found out that no police report had been
made at all. When I demanded that the report be filed and made official, I
was told that I had a statute of limitations of five days to ask and demand
prosecution from the date of the incident and that now I was too late."
In other words, Nicholson was hoodwinked by officialdom. A spokesman for
the Las Vegas Police Department said that investigators informed Nicholson
he had to contact the department within five days of the incident if he
wanted to initiate action against Davis, since it was "just a misdemeanor
battery." LVMPD officials are sticking to their story that Nicholson had
not contacted the department seeking action against Davis.
The spokesman also said the department gave all of the information to the
IRS Criminal Investigation Division. No announcement has been forthcoming
as to whether Davis has been terminated, placed on leave pending an
investigation, or is being held for psychiatric observation.
"If Nicholson wants prosecution, he can contact the general investigations
division within the department and they can move forward on it," the
unnamed spokesman added. However, the frustrations of not seeing any
justice in the criminal courts have motivated Nicholson toward a civil

Reply-To: ParanoidTimes
U.S. Out of Line on Global Positioning, EU Says
Barry James
International Herald Tribune
Wednesday, December 19, 2001
PARIS - The European Commission said Tuesday that the
United States had sought to block the deployment of a
European system of navigation known as Galileo, with
the Americans arguing that an enemy could turn it
against the West in the event of a war.
The U.S. move added to the economic and political
pressures surrounding the project in Europe, where
many countries see it as a vital means of catching up
with America in a key technology sector but others
balk at the expense.
Only last weekend, at a summit meeting in Brussels,
leaders of the European Union instructed government
ministers to try to resolve the financing issues by
A spokesman for the commission said the U.S. Defense
Department had written to the defense ministers of the
15 EU countries warning that Galileo could be used by
an enemy and asking governments to consider scrapping
the project.
But President Jacques Chirac of France warned that
Europeans risked "vassal status" if they abandoned
this and other important space projects.
France and several other governments, as well as the
European Commission, see Galileo as a vital
counterweight to the U.S. Global Positioning System,
which has a vast number of military and civilian
applications, from landing smart weapons on target to
locating trucks on a continental highway network.
The United States offers free use of the Global
Positioning System to the EU countries, but the
commission spokesman, Gilles Gantelet, said there was
no guarantee that it would still be free in 10 years'
Loyola de Palacio, the European commissioner in charge
of the Galileo project, angrily denounced the
prospects of further delays. "We are at the limits of
coherence already," she said, "and any new delay
threatens the profitability of the project."
While the United States had originally expressed its
support for the European project, Mrs. Palacio said
there was now "a letter and pressure exerted by the
United States. American pressure against the Galileo
project has increased since September 11."
The commission says the project must be operational by
2008 to be profitable. This is partly because the
World Telecommunication Union has guaranteed radio
frequencies only up to that date, and partly because
the EU has entered into commitments with a number of
other countries, including the United States, Canada,
Russia and China.
Under the worst possible scenario, including the need
for backup launchers and satellites, the final bill to
deploy Galileo could be as high as E3.6 billion ($3.2
billion), according to an independent accounting survey
carried out on behalf of the commission this year.
But the accounting study also estimated that Galileo
would generate economic benefits more than four times
greater than that, with wide scale applications in
transport and personal communications, and a vital
contribution to the operations of police, fire and
emergency services. The study indicated substantial
social and economic benefits, "notably for the
protection of the environment, employment and European
technological development."
Mr. Gantelet said the U.S. objections were contained
in a letter dated Dec. 4 from the deputy secretary of
defense, Paul Wolfowitz. He said the Americans
considered, "in times of conflict, they would have
problems because of Galileo. They feel that the enemy
could use some applications of Galileo and that they
could not impede that."
According to diplomatic sources who have seen the
letter, Mr. Wolfowitz said the United States was
planning to upgrade its Global Positioning System by
separating the military and civilian spectra.
The addition of Galileo services in the same spectra,
the letter said, "will significantly complicate our
ability to ensure availability of critical GPS
services in times of crisis or conflict and at the
same time assure that adversary forces are denied
similar capabilities."
He said the U.S. government was willing to work toward
finding acceptable solutions to "avert potentially
serious impacts."
The apparent U.S. bid to block Galileo is likely to
have the most resonance precisely in the countries
most skeptical about the project: Britain, the
Netherlands and Germany. They argue in essence that it
is pointless to spend so much money on something they
can get for free from the United States.
Because of their objections, EU transport ministers
refused on Dec. 7 to release money to fund the next
phase of the project.
In a speech to the National Center for Space Studies
in Paris, Mr. Chirac said that satellite navigation
had vital commercial and industrial applications and
would be a key factor in the European Union's ambition
to build up an independent security capability, with
the planned creation of a rapid reaction military force.
Mr. Chirac said the United States spent six times more
on space ventures than the European Union. Not to
react to U.S. space conquests, he said "would lead our
country inevitably to a vassal status, first scientific
and technical and then industrial and economic."

@_subject: [infowars] Homeland Security Job Offer (fwd) 
Reply-To: infowars
I'm a professional software trainer and developer and below is an offer from a broker I use.  The thing that surprised me was the magnitude of this thing-30,000 new-hires for the Homeland Security I'm a little nervous about the new 'Homeland Security' branch of our government.  Once it kicks in, and we have a new government agency with 30,000-200,000 workers keeping an eye on the citizenry...I wonder what happens when the immediate threat goes away.  Will we just downsize the agency?  Historically, I'd say FAT CHANCE!  If anything, new enemies will be found that will justify an expansion-
both in the size and powers of this agency.
Back in the 70's I worked in the intelligence community as a Russian Linguist.  I used to subscribe to the 2 major Soviet newspapers:  Isvestiya and Pravda- which translated mean literally 'News' and 'Truth' respectfully.  These two major papers tried to produce an illusion of choice in the news, but on all the major issues they agreed 100%.  People I knew who had fled the Soviet Union, used to joke "there's no Pravda in the Isvestiya, and there's no Isvestiya in the Pravda" --a play on the meanings of the words Pravda-Truth and Isvestiya-News.  I used to marvel that while the average Soviet knew the government was occasionally lying to them, by and large, they believed most of the major lies of the state.  I marveled that people in the Soviet Union didn't just see that the government was lying about almost everything and that the supposedly egalitarian government they had, was just as feudal as their old system under the czar.  Just different people in power, but those in real power lived just as extravagantly as the Czar's people and wielded their power with many times more cruelty.
But just like in the novel 1984, the Soviets had a very effective means of keeping the people in line.  They kept the common people stirred up with a constant enemy, which was usually the United States.  The effect of this, was to remove the people's attention from real issues, like shortages of toilet paper, food and clothing.
I now see a very similar pattern emerging here in the US.  I surf through all the channels on my cable, and virtually every national news station has had as their channel description:
-War on Terrorism
-American at War
-America Under Attack
And it's almost as if, every major news reporting agency is reporting the same exact thing, with exactly the same slant on every major story.  Every newspaper, every radio station and every TV channel seems to present the same party line, a whole lot like the way things were in the good ol' CCCP (USSR).  By making the enemy into something pure evil--the common person's attention is drawn away from real issues.  And I'm not just talking about terrorism.  Before this, it was bootleggers.  Then in the 50's it was communists.  More recently, drugs.  Before the war on drugs, it was pretty rare for cops to break down doors and bust into people's homes at night dressed in military style uniforms, helmets and uniforms.  It was also more rare for corrupt prosecutors to steal all the private possessions of individuals and imprison them without evidence of any kind, other than the false testimony of 'snitches' who manufacture testimony to cut their own prison time.
Later I lived in Korea for several years as a civilian.  Walking through the countryside, North of Seoul, I would occasionally find pamphlets that the North Koreans had sent over via balloons.  They were a lot like the 'have-you-been-saved' Chick pamphlets that were everywhere back in the 60's and 70's.  The pamphlets portrayed Americans with grotesque caricatures-sunken eyes, large noses and drooling over the prospect of raping young Korean girls or evil businessmen stealing cartloads of money from the poor to support their evil and extravagant lifestyles.  The typical North Korean (and many South Koreans) believed much of this.  When faced with an American-genuine anger, fear and loathing were a natural response.  Again, this attitude helps draw the focus of the common person away from disastrous government policies, and onto non-issues.
The term 'KGB' in Russian is Komitet Gosudarstvennoi Byezopastni  which I would translate as "Bureau for State/Homeland Security".  The term KGB is often associated with evil and tyranny.  However, to most Soviets, and certainly to those who served, the ostensible purpose of the KGB was to 'protect' and ensure the safety of the 'homeland'.  Then the  Germans had their Schutzstaffel (SS-defense corp), Sicherheitsdienst (SD-security service) and Geheime Staats Polizei (Gestapo-secret state police).  The average German, and again those who served inside these organizations were proud of them and considered that these groups were 'protecting' their homeland.

@_subject: Bush's State of the Union speech was a historic 'missed opportunity' 
Reply-To: infowars
Bush's State of the Union speech was a historic 'missed opportunity'
WASHINGTON, DC -- George W. Bush missed a historic opportunity in his
State of the Union address last night by not refocusing the federal
government on its primary function: Defending the lives and rights of
American citizens.
Instead, he outlined a laundry list of 39 new government proposals, new
expenditures, and expanded programs -- as well as a potentially endless,
worldwide "War on Terrorism," said Libertarian Party Executive Director
Steve Dasbach.
"George Bush's compassionate conservatism is sounding a lot like
compulsive Clintonism," he said. "Instead of using September 11 as an
opportunity to limit the federal government to its core role of defending
America, President Bush is using the tragic terrorist attacks as an excuse
to further expand the federal government."
In fact, during his 48-minute speech, Bush proposed 39 new or expanded
government initiatives, according to the Cato Institute -- which is almost
as many on a per-minute basis as Bill Clinton proposed in his last State
of the Union address.
Such a strategy not only flies in the face of what conservatives profess
to believe -- it also makes Americans less secure, said Dasbach.
"A sprawling, trying-to-do-everything federal government cannot
effectively focus on protecting Americans against foreign threats," he
said. "A government that tries to do too much will end up doing too little
where it really matters -- keeping us safe from foreign threats."
In his State of the Union speech:
* Bush proposed the "largest increase in defense spending in two decades."
He also said the U.S. will take action against an "axis of evil" --
nations like North Korea, Iraq, and Iran which have the potential to
develop weapons of mass destruction.
Missed opportunity: America doesn't need to spend more money to protect
itself -- it needs to spend less money smarter, said Dasbach.
"September 11 could have been used as an opportunity to bring American
troops home from the 144 nations and territories where they are stationed;
to stop subsidizing the defense of wealthy European nations; and to stop
intervening in foreign conflicts that do not affect our security," he
said. "Instead, September 11 is being used as an excuse to rid the entire
world of 'evil-doers,' while spending more money than we did during the
Cold War.
"What President Bush should have done is announce clear, measurable, and
finite goals for this War on Terrorism. Our nation's best interests will
be served by decisive action that targets the guilty, spares the innocent,
and ends as quickly as possible."
* In a clear reference to Enron, Bush said corporations should be "held to
the highest standard of conduct."
Missed opportunity: Bush should have used the Enron debacle to vow to end
wasteful corporate welfare, said Dasbach.
"While there is clear evidence of irresponsibility by Enron executives,
many Americans don't realize that politicians used tax dollars to
irresponsibly enrich those same executives," he said. "Over the past few
years, Enron has received at least $1.6 billion from the federal
government in Import-Export Bank subsidies and from the federal Overseas
Private Investment Corporation.
"What Bush should have done is promise to immediately end all Aid to
Dependent Corporations -- especially ones with corrupt executives and
shoddy accounting practices."
* Bush unveiled the USA Freedom Corps, which will expand the AmeriCorps
program and the Peace Corps, and promote "service" to the nation.
Missed opportunity: Bush should have abolished Bill Clinton's tax-funded
AmeriCorps program, said Dasbach -- and publicly rejected the notion that
compassion comes with a government paycheck attached to it.
"President Bush should have realized that you don't display your love for
country by becoming a tax-funded volunteer," he said. "And Bush should
have promised to take the money that has been squandered on the AmeriCorps
program and return it to individual citizens -- who can best decide how to
spend it to help their nation."
* Finally, Bush promised to extend unemployment benefits, expand the Head
Start program, upgrade teacher colleges, enact a Patients' Bill of Rights,
and expand Medicare to give seniors coverage for prescription drugs.
Missed opportunity: Bush should have used the current economic downturn to
start trimming government programs and spending, said Dasbach.
"Bush's modest tax cuts, which passed last year, were a nice start to help
revitalize the economy," he said. "But that effort will now be undercut by
more government spending, more bureaucracy, and higher deficits.
Regretfully, each of Bush's 39 new and expanded programs will further slow
the effort to create economic growth."
In his State of the Union speech, Bush said he supported "limits on state
power," noted Dasbach.
"Whether in the area of national defense, corporate welfare, volunteerism,
or federal programs, Bush should start to put that limited-government
principle into practice," he said. "The fact that he did not do so was his
greatest missed opportunity."
Blessed Be!

SAME M.E.( Dr. Joye M. Carter) IN BAXTER (ENRON) DEATH AS IN WILCHER DEATH "FROM: Garby Leon

Culver City, CA
July 14, 1993
Attorney General of the United States
Department of Justice - Room 4400
Tenth and Constitution Ave N.E.
Washington, DC 20530
Dear Madame Attorney General,
I am writing because I feel the death of Paul Wilcher deserves your most serious attention, and should be investigated by your
most trusted officials in the Department of Justice.
Paul Wilcher, like Danny Casolaro, was investigating possible government involvement in a variety of questionable activities,
including the controversial October Surprise allegations and the INSLAW case, his researches leading him into areas that
Casolaro had covered earlier. In his quest Wilcher made himself known in and around Capitol Hill as a persistent gadfly, trying
to spur inquiries into possible government malfeasance in several areas. He had contacts with, among others, Lee Hamilton,
William Webster, Elliot Richardson and Ross Perot.
By late May, Wilcher said his information had gone beyond Casolaro's and he felt this made him a da"danger signal.U In three
weeks, he was dead.
I feel that the two deaths, Casolaro's and Wilcher's, offer disturbing parallels, outlined below.
On the 23rd of June, 1993, the body of Paul Wilcher was discovered in his Washington DC apartment. This is not a certainty,
since to my knowledge no evidentially identification-no fingerprint or dental x- ray matching-was made before the body's
reported cremation two weeks ago.
Present at the scene after Wilcher's death was noted White House correspondent Sarah McClendon, who knew Wilcher well
and who had alerted authorities that he was missing. McClendon was unable to identify the body as Wilcher after viewing the
McClendon has been told that preliminary autopsy results have found "no natural cause of death, and no other cause of death to
explain Wilcher's demise. Given that Wilcher, in his 40s, was in apparent good health, this seems fairly astonishing.
A much larger issue is also implied here: if critics of our government are found dead in their bathrooms from obscure causes,
and the government itself doesn't take steps to find out why, then our freedoms themselves are threatened-as well as the
activities that protect those freedoms.
If individual investigation and criticism of government activities is chilled or intimidated into silence, then democracy loses its
most important protection.
To put it another way, if Danny Casolaro's death was a message of some kind, then Wilcher's death is an even grimmer
message-it suggests that Casolaro's death was not a fluke. Anyone inspired to follow Casolaro or Wilcher's path now has a
strong added reason to fear doing so.
And a real investigation into Wilcher's death might not be an academic exercise. One person who is extremely close to and
knowledgeable about the Casolaro case has said in private that the mystery of Casolaro's death could be resolved by a Grand
Jury investigation, with sworn testimony, subpoena power, etc. This suggests Paul Wilcher's death may not have to remain a
mystery either.
Paul Wilcher was an acquaintance of mine. He was not a perfect person; he made mistakes like anyone else but he was also, at
times, a man of unusual energy and altruism. A seminary student who considered becoming a priest, he later became an attorney
is his efforts to accomplish some good in this world.
Overall, I fell he was a good man. He didn't deserve to die.
Personally, I don't believe he died of natural causes.
In the following pages are brief remarks regarding A) disturbing parallels between the Casolaro and Wilcher cases; B) Police,
FBI and CIA presence at the scene; C) other information about Wilcher's death; and D) possible further forensic investigation.
Mme. Attorney General, I feel the death of Paul Wilcher offers too many questions and inconsistencies to be ignored. I am
writing because I feel this matter deserves your most serious attention,and hope this letter will bring some action on your part to
answer some of the many, very troubling questions raised by Paul Wilcher's death.
Garby Leon
(PhD, Harvard University)
DISTURBING PARALLELS BETWEEN THE WILCHER AND CASOLARO CASES:
Both were investigating possible government involvement in illegal Each was acting on his own, with dogged persistence, over a long time Both Casolaro and Wilcher expressed fears, shortly before their deaths, that their lives were in danger because their
investigations had led into sensitive territory. Casolaro was known to have received direct phone call threats, and told his
brother shortly before he died, "If something happens to me, it won't be an accident."
As stated, Wilcher told at least one other person at the end of May that he feared he'd become a "danger signal" because his
information on government malfeasance had gone beyond Casolaro's. In three weeks he was dead.
Both decedents' bodies were found in bathrooms, in bizarre circumstances (Casolaro a supposed suicide though forensic
evidence cast substantial doubt on this; Wilcher, a man in good health, propped up on a toilet but showing no discernible cause
of death).
In both cases, the scene of death was sealed off and made inaccessible, then cleaned, preventing any further official or
independent investigation (the motel room where Casolaro was found was industrially cleaned the next day; Wilcher's apartment
was sealed off and no one was allowed to enter; it was also cleaned the next day. I am unaware of any subsequent, serious
investigation or crime report released to the public in either case).
In both cases, personal records, documents, computer files and/or other information belonging to the decedents are apparently
not officially accounted for. Casolaro's briefcase and personal records were not found at the scene of his death. While Wilcher's
family reportedly has taken possession of some personal belongings, the location of Wilcher's complete files, the result of years
of hard work, is not publicly known.
In both cases, rapid alterations were made to the corpse making further forensic study difficult or impossible. Casolaro was
embalmed shortly after death without family consent; Wilcher was cremated, as remarked above, without fingerprint or other
evidential identification of the body, and without complete forensic examination to determine cause of death.
In both cases, forensic evidence relating to the corpses is scant.
In neither case was any kind of inquest held, no official testimony taken under oath, nor was any thoroughgoing official
investigation undertaken (at least publicly). Nor has any official report been released in either case.
POLICE, FBI & CIA PRESENCE AT THE SCENE, JUNE 23, 1993:
According to Mr. MASON O. LIDELL JR. (637 Third St. NE, Apt. B-03, DC 20002) superintendent of Wilcher's building, a
Lieutenant and a Sergeant from the D. C. Police (with the help of firemen to force the door) entered Wilcher's apartment at
about 11:30 AM on June 23rd. Three detectives from DC Police entered and found Wilcher's computer was turned on. When
they read what was on the computer screen, they summoned the FBI. There is no further information on what the screen
actually said.
After entering the apartment and getting a brief glance at the body and the apartment, Lidell was ordered to leave. The
apartment was sealed off for the rest of the day, except for official personnel. The body was removed at about 12:30 according
to Lidell (who didn't witness this), though he did mention that when he entered the apartment later, there was blood on the floor
and on the commode which wasn't present earlier. He was told that this was because of measures taken to move the body.
At about 4:30 in the afternoon FBI Agents arrived. Sarah McClendon was also present, though not allowed in the apartment
itself. She says two groups of four FBI Agents - eight FBI Agents in all - arrived and asked questions. McClendon checked
their identification, which seemed convincing. According to Lidell at least three FBI Agents entered the apartment during the
4:30 to 7:30 time period.
Then, according to Lidell, one man appeared and said he was CIA (without offering identification). He joined the FBI agents in
the Wilcher apartment during the 4:30 to 7:30 time period. More people could have entered during this time Lidell says "he
returned to his own apartment and didn't keep track."
Lidell says that an NBC camera crew was prevented from entering the apartment. Aside from firemen, medical personnel to
remove the body and the above Government agents, no one was allowed in the apartment for the entire day - no reporters,
friends, media crews, etc. This raises a question: why no other observers, since police okayed cleaning of the apartment the
very next day?
Ms. McClendon phoned the FBI to ask about the presence of FBI Agents; later MR. JAMES V. DESARNO JR., Assistant
Special Agent in Charge from the D. C. Metropolitan Office, arrived. Mr. Desarno also asked questions, but strongly denied
that the FBI was interested in or involved in the case. "We are not interested in this case," he told McClendon, Lidell and others
This seems curious. If Wilcher was a "nobody" why the official presence and vehement expression of non-involvement "ironic"
with so many agents present? How could Desarno know the FBI would or wouldn't be involved without an investigation or
known cause of death? Why all the secrecy and denial? Why the presence of the CIA?
OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT WILCHER'S DEATH
Only a few slight pieces of information have filtered down about public officials and others involved in the Wilcher matter:
Two FBI Agents present at the scene were JAMES V. DESARNO, as remarked, and CRAIG OLSON, both of the D. C.
Metropolitan Office: 1900 Half Street SW, Washington DC 20535. (202) 252-7801, both at same address and office.
The DC police officer in charge of investigating the Wilcher death is named BRIAN HENRY, (202) 727-4347.
Coroner for the government is a DR. KIM, who performed the autopsy, the results of which have not been released.
Building superintendent MASON LIDELL (202-543-2751) was questioned by Desarno and others, and has kindly provided
information in this letter.
One friend of Wilcher's phoned apartment 302 in Wilcher's building (across from his) and got a taped answer message on the
telephone intercom. The message said (paraphrasing) "This is a government telephone line, no longer in service" or words to that
effect. Phone records, occupancy etc. from this address should be POSSIBLE FURTHER FORENSIC INVESTIGATION:
Given the inconclusive autopsy results, further testing of the forensic evidence would seem to be crucial. Wilcher's body fluids,
sent by the D. C. Medical Examiner to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology at Walter Reed Hospital, haven't yielded any
clue as to cause of death. Apparently coroner Dr. Kim is still in possession of Wilcher's heart.
Sarah McClendon is petitioning Dr. JOYE CARTER of the D. C. Medical Examiner's office to submit this forensic evidence for
further study. Dr. Carter hasn't moved with alacrity to permit or facilitate this.
McClendon would like to submit the evidence to a DR. MASON, one of the top forensic toxicologists in the U. S. (Dr. Mason:
2300 Stratford Ave, Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, 215 657-4900). Dr. Mason feels it is extremely significant that no cause of
death has been found, a rarity in his experience.
Perhaps, Mme. Attorney General, you can aid in investigating this and other crucial aspects of Paul Wilcher's death. Thank you
for any consideration in response to this request

Harris County medical examiner fined for illegal autopsies, keeps job
HOUSTON (AP) - Harris County's chief medical examiner was fined $1,000 on Friday as part of a settlement reach with the
Texas State Board of Medical Examiners for allowing an unlicensed pathologist to perform autopsies.
Dr. Joye Carter had faced stiffer punishment, including revocation of her medical license and the loss of her job, as a result of
the investigation.
The agreement ends a three-year controversy that erupted when it was revealed that Carter had hired Delbert Van Dusen and
allowed him to perform autopsies, including some in homicide cases, without a Texas medical license.

In the verdict, jurors said Medical Examiner Dr. Joye Carter and Johnson's immediate supervisor, Dr. Ashraf Mozayani, were responsible for damaging Johnson. The jury assessed $15,000 in damages for lost wages and benefits, and $300,000 in future compensation damages.

Legal review of examiner's office sought
County official wants to know 'what's going on over there'
Harris County Commissioner Steve Radack wants the county to hire a local law firm to review Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Joye
Carter's hiring and firing practices in response to a second successful whistle-blower lawsuit against Carter's office.
Radack placed an item on the court's May 2 agenda calling on the county to hire Fulbright & Jaworski "to form an outside review
of the employment practices of the medical examiner's office, " a review Carter said she welcomes.
Radack said he wants "to find out a very respectable law firm's opinion of what's going on over there."
The whistle-blower suits resulted in awards totaling $625,000 to two former employees who claimed that Carter fired them for
reporting illegal or potentially illegal practices at the office.
A third former employee has threatened to file a third whistle-blower suit. Those suits and legal threats have cost Carter some
support on the Commissioners Court.
The first of the two whistle-blower suits was filed by Dr. Elizabeth "Libby" Johnson, who was awarded $375,000 by a state jury in
1998. Johnson, who headed the medical examiner's DNA lab, claimed that she was fired for blowing the whistle on potentially
illegal cover-ups at the office.
Dr. Marilyn Murr Doyle, a former pathologist, was awarded $250,000 in federal court last month. A jury found that Doyle was
fired in 1998 because she reported that an unlicensed physician in the office had been allowed to perform autopsies.

Whistle-blower gets $250,000 judgment
Civil jury sides with fired pathologist
A federal jury awarded $250,000 Friday to a former Harris County pathologist who said she was fired in 1998 for
blowing the whistle on what she considered illegal activity in the medical examiner's office.
The award marks the second time a jury has sided with a fired worker in the medical examiner's office who crossed
Dr. Joye Carter to report problems in that county office.
Looking drained after the two-week trial, Marilyn Murr Doyle said she was grateful to the eight-member jury. "I did
what was right, and I feel like they backed me up," Doyle said. "I feel like justice has been done."
Doyle testified that she went to Carter on Jan. 5, 1998, with concerns that Dr. Delbert Van Dusen was performing
autopsies without a Texas medical license***
Jurors deliberated about six hours before reaching a decision in the lawsuit, which alleged that the county violated
Doyle's First Amendment right to free speech and state whistle-blower "The evidence does not support the verdict," Gambill maintained.
The linchpin of the case was Doyle's Jan. 5, 1998, meeting with Carter. After Doyle complained about Van Dusen's
licensing status, Carter began to scrutinize every aspect of Doyle's professional life.
Doyle said her personnel file was papered with memos about insubordination, excessive absences from work and
complaints about tardiness in an effort to build a case against her.
For example, Doyle said, she was cited for failing to comply with a requirement that employees' time sheets agree
with computerized records of their comings and goings from the medical examiner's building.
But the veteran pathologist said she was unaware of the requirement, until just before she and other pathologists
were told that administrators would analyze the time sheets and computer records in February to see who was
complying with the order.
In early March, the analysis was released showing that Doyle and some of the other doctors were not in compliance.
Doyle was the only physician fired.
The five-man, three-woman jury was unanimous in its decisions on four key issues:
· Carter fired Doyle for exercising her right to free speech by reporting alleged illegal conduct to Holmes.
· Harris County fired Doyle solely because she exercised her right to free speech.
· Doyle was fired for blowing the whistle on conduct she believed to be illegal.
· Doyle, who was hired by former Chief Medical Examiner Joseph Jachimczyk, was fired solely because she
reported an alleged legal violation.
Although the jury's award fell far short of the $3 million Doyle sought, the tally may climb when Harmon assesses
requests for interest and attorneys' fees.
Jurors awarded Doyle $55,000 for lost wages and benefits from the date she was fired until the trial date and $95,000
for future wages and benefits.
The jury also awarded Doyle $50,000 for mental anguish and $50,000 for loss of enjoyment of life.
Doyle said the verdict vindicated her. However, she said her professional reputation has already been sullied by
Carter's allegations.
"After all my training and work this has pretty much ruined my career in Texas," she said.
Doyle said she was forced to move from her home in Houston to Tennessee in July 1998 to find work as a forensic
In November 1998, the county agreed to pay Dr. Elizabeth "Libby" Johnson $375,000 and to drop the county's appeal
of her successful whistle-blower lawsuit in state district court.
Johnson sued the county in March 1997, contending that Carter fired her for reporting potentially illegal cover-ups
and sabotage at the office.
A jury sided with Johnson and awarded her $315,000 plus attorney's fees. The county immediately appealed the
verdict to the First Court of Appeals.
But Harris County Attorney Michael P. Fleming said the potential cost of fighting the lawsuit rose to more than
$453,000 in a few months. With the potential that costs would rise and the unlikely prospect of getting the verdict
overturned, Fleming suggested the county cut its losses.

Shelly's dead body was airlifted by Medstar helicopter to D. C. from the field after a mercy call from the good men of
The Plains Fire and Rescue Squad. Shelly's autopsy pictures, especially two of her face suggest she was beaten. It
demands explanation why the report of D. C. Coroner, Dr. Joye Carter, overlooked commenting on the fact that
Shelly's lips were split in two places and that there are multiple contusions and abrasions to her face and body. It is
a fact that influential people in The Plains tried to have the autopsy canceled (Cf. the Sheriff's files in the Shelly

POSSIBLE FURTHER FORENSIC INVESTIGATION:
Given the inconclusive autopsy results, further testing of the forensic evidence would seem to be crucial. Wilcher's
body fluids, sent by the D. C. Medical Examiner to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology at Walter Reed Hospital,
haven't yielded any clue as to cause of death. Apparently coroner Dr. Kim is still in possession of Wilcher's heart.
Sarah McClendon is petitioning Dr. JOYE CARTER of the D. C. Medical Examiner's office to submit this forensic
evidence for further study. Dr. Carter hasn't moved with alacrity to permit or facilitate this.
County Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Joye Carter said she cited Gulf War Syndrome as a contributing cause of death-
it was last among nine causes-because it had been diagnosed by Department of Veterans Affairs doctors.
"This is a syndrome with multiple aspects," said Carter, who served as an Air Force medical examiner during Desert
Storm. "We're not sure what it is. Its symptoms run the gamut-strange chemical tastes, benign tumors, heart
disease, heart palpitations. ... "
Another symptom is a psychological reaction similar to post-traumatic stress disorder, which is sometimes marked by
substance abuse in former servicemen.
Ingram, said Dr. Sara McCarron, the Harris County pathologist who performed the autopsy, had a history of
depression and alcohol abuse.
"He may have been self-medicating due to depression and/or post-traumatic stress disorder," she said

Time to rewrite the DMCA
By  Rick Boucher
January 29, 2002, 12:00 PM PT
The American public has traditionally enjoyed the ability to make convenient and incidental copies of copyrighted works without obtaining the prior consent of copyright owners. These traditional "fair use" rights are at the foundation of the receipt and use of information by the American people.
Unfortunately, those rights are now under attack.
In 1997, motion picture studios, record producers, book publishers and other content owners came to Congress with a simple proposition: Give us a law that will stop pirates from circumventing technical protection measures used to safeguard copyrighted works, and we will release all sorts of exciting new content in digital formats
At the time, libraries, universities, consumer electronics manufacturers, Internet portals and others warned that enactment of the broadly worded legislation would stifle new technology, would threaten access to information, and would move us inexorably towards a "pay per use" society. That day is now close at hand.
When Congress considered the content community's anti-circumvention proposal, I put forward a series of amendments intended to preserve the fair-use rights of consumers. My colleagues and I feared that broad application of the proposed new anti-circumvention law would threaten the viability of the fair-use doctrine in the digital age.
Unfortunately, as so often happens, Congress paid more attention to the loudest voices in the debate.
In writing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998, Congress made some important, but ultimately modest, changes to the original proposal. And we persuaded ourselves that we had achieved a rough balance of interests. But in the end, Congress agreed to a fundamentally flawed bill, which created the new crime of circumvention--a crime divorced from over a century and a half of respect for the fair-use rights of consumers.
The DMCA, as enacted, quite clearly tilted the balance in the Copyright Act toward complete protection and away from information In the three years since the law was enacted, we have not seen the promised new digital content. Instead, we have seen a rash of lawsuits; the imprisonment by U.S. authorities of a Russian computer programmer who had come to the United States to give a technical talk; and, more recently, the release of compact discs into the market that cannot be played in computers or even some CD players, and thus cannot be used to create custom compilations of consumers' favorite songs.
Some of the most serious lawsuits have implicated academic freedom and free speech. In response to an open challenge by the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI), which invited the world to seek to defeat the watermarking technologies it had proposed for protecting digital audio content, Princeton University Professor Edward Felten and his colleagues defeated all of the proposed watermarks. The Felten team then sought to exercise their First Amendment rights by publishing the results of their scientific research and presenting the paper at a security conference.
Before he presented the paper, however, Felten received a threatening letter from the SDMI warning that doing so would subject him to liability under the DMCA. Felten then filed a lawsuit to uphold his First Amendment right to publish his research findings. The case has been dismissed, but the issue has not gone away, because the judge did not rule on the actual merits of his complaint.
Similarly, the publisher of 2600 magazine was sued by motion picture studios for providing a link to a Web site that contained the DeCSS code, which can be used to defeat the industry-standard DVD copy protection system enabling movies to be played on a Linux-based operating system. After losing at the trial level, the magazine publisher appealed, trying to preserve his right to link to sites without being held responsible for everything on those sites.
Unfortunately, the federal courts in these cases did not uphold the First Amendment rights of these publishers. In the 2600 case, the appellate court circumscribed traditionally accepted fair-use rights by declaring that these rights did not apply to the most convenient, highest-quality formats available to consumers. These examples of the content community successfully threatening and hauling into court individuals seeking to exercise traditional free speech rights demonstrate how the DMCA is flawed, and has tipped the copyright balance in a damaging way against traditional fair-use rights.
Given the breadth of the DMCA, the fair-use rights of the public at large also are at risk. From the college student who photocopies a page from a library book or prints an article from a newspaper's Web site for use in writing a report, to the newspaper reporter excerpting materials from a document for a story, to the typical television viewer who records a broadcast program for viewing at a later time, we all depend on the ability to make limited copies of copyrighted material without having to pay a fee or obtain prior approval of the copyright owner.
In fact, fair-use rights to obtain and use a wide array of information are essential to the exercise of First Amendment rights. The very vibrancy of our democracy is dependent upon the information availability and use facilitated by the fair-use doctrine.
Yet, efforts to exercise those rights increasingly are being threatened by section 1201 of the DMCA, which created the new crime of circumvention. Section 1201 (a)(1), for example, prohibits unauthorized access to a work by circumventing an effective technological protection measure used by a copyright owner to control access to a copyrighted work. Because the law does not limit its application to circumvention for the purpose of infringing a copyright, all types of traditionally accepted activities may be at risk. Any action of circumvention without the consent of the copyright owner is made criminal.
Consider the implications. A time may soon come when what is available for free on library shelves will only be available on a pay-per-use basis. It would be a simple matter for a copyright owner to impose a requirement that a small fee be paid each time a digital book or video documentary is accessed by a library patron. Even the student who wants even the most basic access to only a portion of the book to write a term paper would have to pay to avoid committing a The day is already here in which copyright owners use "click on" licenses to limit what purchasers of a copyrighted work may do with it. Some e-book licenses, for example, prohibit the reader from reading the book out loud. Some go so far as to make it a violation of the license to even criticize the contents of a work, let alone to make a copy of a paragraph or two.
To counter this emerging threat to traditionally accepted fair-use values, Congress must rewrite the law. We should begin by revising section 1201, which is at the heart of the Felten and 2600 magazine litigations, and which can be used to keep library patrons from copying even a paragraph from a book without making a separate The only conduct that should be declared criminal is circumvention for the purpose of infringing a copyright. That approach would provide adequate protection for copyright owners without abridging the legitimate fair-use rights of consumers, libraries, educators and other users.
For over 150 years, the fair-use doctrine has helped stimulate broad advances in scientific inquiry and education, and has advanced broad societal goals in countless other ways. In this emerging digital era, we need to return to first principles. We need to achieve the balance that should be at the heart of our efforts to promote the interests of copyright owners while respecting the rights of information consumers. We need to rewrite the law for the benefit of society as a whole before all access to information is irreversibly controlled. In short, we need to reaffirm fair use.

EU vice-president to claim US site spies on European business
VICE-PRESIDENT of the European Parliament, Gerhardt Schmid, is expected to
argue that the Echelon system used at the United States base at Menwith
Hill, near Harrogate, is used for industrial espionage when he speaks in the
town next week.
Dr Schmid compiled the European Parliament's report on Echelon, which is
believed to intercept millions of telephone calls, faxes, e-mails and other
electronic communications and pass confidential information to the US
National Security Agency.
The German Socialist Euro MP has accepted an invitation from the Menwith
Hill Forum ­ which monitors activities at the 560-acre intelligence site ­
to speak at the Friends Meeting House in Queen Parade, Harrogate, on
Thursday at 7.30pm.
The signals intelligence station already has a key role in Echelon, but its
importance will grow when hundreds of staff are transferred to Menwith Hill
from Bad Abling ­ the National Security Agency's third largest monitoring
station, which is in the Bavarian Alps.
Although the US Government has denied the existence of Echelon, it is known
to be shared with Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Britain. UK Government
sources justify it as a means of gathering information on terrorist
organisations and international drug cartels.
But Dr Schmid is expected to argue that Echelon is also used by the United
States Government to gather sensitive economic data from European countries,
which is allegedly being passed on to benefit industrial rivals across the
Atlantic. One example is said to be a £1bn contract lost by Airbus Industrie
to Boeing and McDonnel Douglas.
Dr Schmid, who will tell the Forum that the uncontrolled use of Echelon is
potentially detrimental to European economies and puts at risk thousands of
jobs, will also explain what the European Parliament is doing to try to
protect citizens' rights.
The Forum's chairman, John Eveleigh said: "This public meeting continues our
aim to inform local people of the activities and genuine concerns we have
around the Menwith Hill surveillance station. I urge anyone interested in
finding out more about Echelon to attend."

Senate Report on Money Laundering
WASHINGTON (AP) - For drug dealers, dictators or terrorists looking to
launder illicit money, U.S. brokerage firms and investment banks may be
convenient and anonymous places to go, Senate investigators say.
A report being released Tuesday found that securities firms have tens of
thousands of offshore clients channeling billions of potentially illicit
dollars into their U.S. accounts.
The banking industry already has come under scrutiny for its use by money
launderers. But the securities industry also ``has clear money laundering
risks that need to be addressed,'' Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the
Senate Governmental Affairs investigative subcommittee, said.
Subcommittee investigators found that all the 22 U.S. securities firms
examined had numerous offshore customers and many of the firms said they
couldn't provide an accurate count of those clients because their data
systems didn't identify offshore entities. The clients include offshore
corporations, trusts, banks and insurance companies.
The securities firms, which were not named, had more than 45,000 offshore
clients total, with an estimated $140 billion in assets in their accounts -
of which some $137 billion came from offshore corporations and trusts,
according to the report.
The high-risk accounts represent about 2 percent of the U.S. firms' total
accounts, it says.
The investigators didn't find any evidence of illegal activity in the 22
firms that they surveyed.
Levin, who has investigated money laundering in the nation's banking
industry, was testifying at a Senate Banking Committee hearing Tuesday on
new anti-money-laundering rules for banks and securities firms that came in
response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Also appearing were high-ranking
officials from the Justice and Treasury departments, the Federal Reserve and
the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the brokerage
Businesses in offshore jurisdictions - such as the Caribbean and tiny
islands in the South Pacific - benefit from financial secrecy laws, which
can encourage laundering of dirty money.
The fight against money laundering gained new urgency after the attacks in
New York City, Washington and southwestern Pennsylvania and revelations that
the al-Qaida network of Osama bin Laden, the prime suspect in the attacks,
uses money from Islamic charities and front companies.
A new anti-terrorism law enacted in October includes rules to combat money
laundering in U.S. banks and securities firms, notably requirements that
they verify their customers' identities and report suspicious transactions
to law enforcement agencies. The rules for banks took effect on Christmas
Day. Final rules for securities firms must be issued by June. Securities
businesses include brokerage firms, investment banks, investment advisers,
bond dealers and mutual funds.
Wall Street had lobbied against some of the rules for securities firms, such
as one prohibiting them from maintaining accounts with foreign shell banks
that exist mainly on paper and lack concrete operations.
``The industry has no patience for money laundering and we have been working
and want to continue to work with the government to eliminate any money
laundering,'' Stuart Kaswell, general counsel of the Securities Industry
Association, Wall Street's major trade group, said Monday.
``We don't want this money in our business. ... We want to make these rules
work,'' Kaswell said. He declined comment on the Senate panel's report,
saying the group hadn't yet seen it.
Law enforcement agencies have been concerned about the securities industry's
potential vulnerability to money laundering, which involves the movement of
profits from drug or arms trafficking, political corruption, prostitution
and other illicit activities through a series of accounts or businesses to
disguise them as proceeds of legitimate business.
An October report by the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative
arm, showed that many U.S. securities firms do not have voluntary controls
against money laundering by customers.
After the Sept. 11 attacks, the SEC asked all securities firms to check
their records for accounts held or transactions by any of the suspects in
the case identified by the FBI, or by any of the people and groups with
suspected links to terrorism - including bin Laden - named in President
Bush's orders to freeze their assets.

@_subject: Australia: Ten-year-old policy of detention is failing (fwd) 
Reply-To: owner-amnesty-l
* News Release Issued by the International Secretariat of Amnesty
International *
28 January 2002
ASA 12/001/2002
"As the risk of fatalities increases in ongoing unrest within
Australian immigration detention centres, it is clear that the
ten-year-old policy of mandatory detention is failing and needs
urgent review, "Amnesty International said today.
      "Of immediate concern is the mental health of the
detainees -- hunger strikes, self-harm and attempted suicides of
detainees have obvious roots in extreme desperation.  This is
created by the combined effects of prolonged incarceration,
social isolation and increasing uncertainty about the future,
with many people fearing for their lives if returned to their
home countries."
      No other country imprisons hundreds of children, and
thousands of men and women for lacking a visa under a national
policy requiring their automatic and indefinite detention,
without charge or review by a court.  Contrary to the
government's line, the policy of detention has not deterred
refugees -- as most of them are found to be -- trying to arrive
without authorization.  The government claims that refugees with
valid travel documents are welcome, but people fleeing
persecution often cannot apply for visa at distant embassies and
then wait months or years for approval.
      "Locking up thousands of refugee applicants has proven
not to stop new attempts at reaching Australia.  Are Australians
really willing to pay any price, human and financial, to maintain
a 10-year-old detention policy which has failed to halt desperate
actions to seek refuge?" the organization asked.
      The focus on the physical conditions in the detention
centres detracts from the key issue behind the unrest - mental
health.  Medical professionals and informed observers have
repeatedly raised concerns about the detainees' mental health and
the standards of medical care in detention.
      Amnesty International called on the Australian government
to relieve detainee anxieties by easing some of the pressures
which underlie their desperate actions. At the very least,
families with children and those already found to meet refugee
criteria should be released, pending completion of their visa
approvals.  Detention should be the exception, not the rule, and
determined case by case.
      Ultimately, parliament should reconsider the underlying
factors contributing to acts of desperation in detention, and
enable a substantial increase of efforts to address the causes of
international refugee flows, notably human rights abuses.
      Amnesty International does not condone any acts of
self-harm or violence, whether committed by asylum-seekers or

Australian government can escape its share of the responsibility
for the circumstances driving detainees into desperation.
      Ongoing fighting and instability in Afghanistan, home to
many of the detainees, makes it unlikely that Afghan
asylum-seekers can safely return in the near future. The

again the need for increased international cooperation to slow
refugee flows and provide humane conditions and solutions for
those unable to return home in safety.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
The American Antitrust Institute has filed a suit for declaratory and
injunctive relief for failure of the Department of Justice and Microsoft
to fully comply with the disclosure requirements of the Tunney Act in
regard to the Microsoft settlement. The suit was filed this morning
(Thursday) and was assigned to the same judge who is handling the
Microsoft case.This is now posted, along with a press release summarizing
the complaint, at We have also posted our 47-page comments on the Microsoft settlement under
the Tunney Act.
Recently we posted information about two new Advisory Board members,
Patricia Connors and Douglas Rosenthal. Trish is the antitrust chief in
Florida and head of the NAAG Multistate Antitrust Task Force. Doug is
former head of the Foreign Commerce Section of the DOJ and a partner in
Sonnenschein, Naff, and Rosenthal. It is worth reiterating that Advisory
Board members do not vote on substantive positions of the AAI. The
Advisory Board is quite diverse in makeup and there is no implication that
all members agree with positions AAI takes. In many situations, an
Advisory Member recuses himself or herself from the informal consultation
process that typically occurs.

In a future cyber war, Microsoft could be forced by Government to

This is going to become major useful in future cyber war conflicts.
Of course, the same applies now to all McAfee, Norton, and other online

Is Windows XP's 'Product Activation' A Privacy Risk?
Aug. 20, 2001  Is Microsoft's mandatory registration scheme also a back door for By Fred Langa
Microsoft's forthcoming XP operating system, which represents the final merging of the Win9X and WinNT/2K product lines, will be a watershed for a number of reasons. We'll deal with many of them over time, but for now, let's focus on its privacy issues.
As XP rolled out in betas, two major areas of privacy-related concerns bubbled to the surface. One was HailStorm, a set of services based on Microsoft's Passport technology (a Microsoft Passport account can contain a large amount of individually identifying data). HailStorm is a large and complex topic, deserving its own extended coverage, so we'll do that in a future column. (To get up to speed in the meantime, you can read Microsoft's explanation and spin about HailStorm and InformationWeek's reporting on the topic (see HailStorm Ties Microsoft To Its Future And Past and other recent articles). Today, we'll focus on the other major area of privacy concern: XP's anti-piracy "Windows Product Activation" feature. While our main focus will be on the operating-system-level WPA, we'll also discuss the WPA that also appears in Microsoft's XP line of Office applications and suites. Once you install XP software, the WPA system keeps track of how many times you've launched the software and how much time has passed. Before the end of a Microsoft-determined amount of time or number of launches, you must--must--register the software, or it reverts to a reduced functionality mode. For example, after 50 launches without registration, Office XP will let you view your documents, but not change them or create new ones. The allowed number of launches and time varies by product. For example, with the XP operating systems, you have 30 days before you must register. So, with the WPA, Microsoft is quite literally forcing you to register--to provide it with some personally identifiable information-
-to keep using the products that you already bought and paid for! Of course, in legal terms, you don't usually buy software; you don't even buy the CDs on which the software resides. You're actually buying a license that lets you use the vendor's software on the CDs. The company selling the license--in this case Microsoft--can make up whatever rules it wants, and you must agree to those rules if you use its software. While larger enterprises are well-versed in the licensing model, medium and smaller business (and individual users) usually still think of software in retail terms: "buying" and "owning" the CDs. To these tens of millions of users, XP's WPA will be a bucket of cold water in the face, reminding them that that, even after paying full retail prices, they don't really own the software on their PCs. I expect Microsoft to experience a consumer backlash from this, especially in light of the rest of the Windows Product Activation story. Hardware Hashing And Phoning Home
You might think you could evade the mandatory registration by doing what many users do when confronted with an invasive request for personal information: lie. You could, for example, make up information and register from a throwaway E-mail account. Except that won't accomplish much with XP. Here's why: When you register XP software, the registration process creates and sends to Microsoft a unique 50-digit numeric fingerprint or code. The code is a combination of the serial number of your copy of XP, plus additional information about 10 major hardware elements in your system. According to the German software firm Fully Licensed, which reverse-engineered the beta XP registration codes (see WPA Resource Center), the hardware "hash" code is based on the following information from your PC: CPU serial number CPU model number/type Amount of RAM in the system Graphics adapter hardware ID string Hard drive hardware ID string SCSI host hardware ID string (if present) Integrated development environment controller hardware ID string MAC address of your network adapter CD-ROM drive hardware identification string Whether the system is a dockable unit (e.g. a notebook) or not
But that's not all. Even when it's been fully registered, the WPA component wakes up from time to time. It verifies that it's on the original system where it was first installed, and it "phones home" to check with the central Microsoft database to make sure it's still, indeed, a registered copy. If the WPA discovers that it's no longer on the system where it was originally installed, or if the Microsoft database at the other end of the phone-home connection says you're not registered, then reduced-
functionality mode kicks in. But note: The WPA software identifies the PC on which it's loaded by the "hash" code of the 10 hardware elements listed above. So if you perform a major upgrade on your PC (say, you installed a new motherboard) the WPA software will assume it's been pirated to a new PC and drop to reduced functionality mode. That will happen even if you're the legitimate license holder working on your own PC, with absolutely no pirating going on. Under the original WPA plan, you'd then have to contact Microsoft by phone, hat in hand, to ask for a new activation of the product you already paid for and registered. It's positively Dickensian: "Please, sir, I want some more." As you might imagine, many users are incensed at this level of monitoring, intrusion, and control by Microsoft. Some are upset at the inconvenience this represents; others are deeply worried about the privacy-invading "Big Brother" nature of the system. There's even a grass-roots campaign to petition Microsoft to change its WPA process. What's Being Phoned Home?
Longtime readers know I'm no fan of phone-home applications, on the general principles that no app should decide that it's going to consume some of my bandwidth for its own benefit; also, I want to control what information various companies can gather about me. (It can be hard or impossible to know exactly what a phone-home app is sending back.) So, on those bases alone, WPA gets a big black mark. But to its credit, Microsoft has played clean in the past with other phone-home apps, such as the automated versions of Windows Update. To my knowledge, there's never been a documented case where those apps have violated user privacy or sent back inappropriate data to Microsoft. I don't believe there's any reason to suspect that the phone-home elements of WPA, per se, will behave any differently. (The HailStorm/Passport issue is separate; we'll come back to that in another column.) And, although the XP operating system is in beta at the time of this writing, independent third parties who have packet-sniffed the WPA's phone-home exchanges report nothing nefarious is going on and that it's not--repeat, not--a wide-open back door by which Microsoft is snooping on your private data. So I am happy to report that--despite what you may hear in the more alarmist corners of the Web--the WPA phone-home process does not, in itself, appear to be a major issue in terms of active snooping. But that still leaves the larger issue of forced registration in general, and that's a huge one. So big, in fact, I think there's a good chance it will turn into a debacle for Microsoft. A Pyrrhic Victory Over Pirates
Without a doubt, Microsoft's intent with WPA was simple: It's an anti-
piracy measure, designed to ensure that Microsoft is paid for every copy of its software in use. If, for example, the Microsoft registration database shows many different machines popping up with the same software serial number, they'll know those copies of the software were stolen and can theoretically trace them back to the original purchaser. Piracy isn't defensible. It's wrong--a form of theft. But there are many, many problems with the WPA approach to stopping piracy. At the conceptual level, it's hard to work up much moral outrage in favor of a company that seems intent on gouging its honest customers. Don't you think it's silly for an Office suite to cost almost as much as much as some brand-new PCs do? Isn't it nuts for a Microsoft operating system to cost hundreds of dollars, when some major competitors cost only a few tens of dollars or even are free? Theft is wrong, but Microsoft muddies the moral waters by charging what I think are unconscionably high prices for its products. It's not as though Microsoft is a tiny company struggling to find black ink, impeded by dastardly software pirates. No, Microsoft is insanely profitable and certainly could cut its customers a little slack. Piracy is wrong, but so is price gouging. Even given Microsoft's legal right to enforce its licenses, WPA is a heavy weapon aimed at the wrong people. Malicious hackers and the "warez" piracy crowd will crack the registration code algorithms soon after XP's release. Microsoft even freely admits this will happen: The "intellectual property protection arena is a cat-and-
mouse game. All IP protection technologies will be cracked at some point; it is just a matter of time." So, Microsoft admits its WPA policies will not seriously impede the overtly illegal software cloners and copiers, and it's obvious that WPA will hamper the mostly lawful, mostly loyal users who aren't the real source of the piracy problem in the first place! It's almost as if Microsoft is saying, "First, we'll gouge you with high prices, then we'll make you jump through flaming hoops." But one group of users will be stopped cold by WPA: the people who allow casual (albeit illegal) copying in offices and homes. One user buys a legitimate copy and lets someone else make a duplicate installation. XP's WPA scheme will, indeed, largely prevent this type of copying. But I think this will be a full-bore Pyrrhic victory for Microsoft. You see, Microsoft has made the foolish assumption that all those excess copies will magically transform into cash as users open their wallets and go legit. But most of those illegal copies are the result of Microsoft's high prices in the first place. If people couldn't afford to buy legal copies of Microsoft software before, they're not going to suddenly cough up hundreds of dollars per seat to go legit just because XP has arrived. Instead, I think these people--for whom obtaining multiple full-price copies is out of the question--will flock to free and low-cost options such as Sun Microsystems' StarOffice Suite and the Linux operating system. Instead of finding a way to embrace its marginal customers, Microsoft will be driving them away. Does that sound like a solid business strategy to you? Sticks And Carrots
I think Microsoft is going about product registration all wrong. In return for asking users to give up some privacy and anonymity by registering, Microsoft could have offered a carrot: some meaningful enticement or truly valuable benefit that users would gain by registering. (In the past, Microsoft has offered trivial, low-value incentives--trinkets and freebies--to registrants, but to my knowledge, it's never tried offering a meaningful inducement.) Need a suggestion, Microsoft? How about giving a $150 rebate to people who register a $300 piece of software? If the rebate were real-
-if you didn't further jack up the software prices to offset this rebate--I'd bet your level of voluntary registration compliance would go through the roof, and the level of piracy would plummet. I'd bet you'd more than make up in sales volume and piracy prevention what you'd lose through funding the rebate. And you'd be the good guys again. But instead of using a carrot, Microsoft has opted to use a stick to force compliance by crippling your XP software--software you've paid top dollar to use--if you don't register within the time frame and by the means that it wants. Microsoft wants your full-fare money and it wants to know who you are, where you are, and what PC you're using--
and you'd better hand it over, buster, or the company will cripple your software. What gall! It's also horrible psychology: With behavior like this, how can anyone not regard Microsoft as an out-of-control bully? How can this jackbooted registration process win customer loyalty and goodwill? What on earth is Microsoft thinking? Microsoft was once a truly great company, but got itself into trouble by bullying its competitors. Now, with WPA, it wants to bully its customers. That's insane; Microsoft is undermining its own future by alienating the very people who elevated it to its present stature and who are the key to its future. Time To Change WPA?
The Windows XP operating system hasn't shipped yet. Although it's very late in the game, there's still some wiggle room. As word about various WPA elements has filtered out, Microsoft has already softened some of it. For example, the whole, from-scratch WPA registration/activation process is triggered not only at first install, but also if (read: "when") you reinstall the software or if you legitimately move the software to a new machine or if you perform a major upgrade of the machine the XP software originally was installed on. As mentioned earlier, the original plan was for you to have to make a phone call to Redmond and, in effect, beg for permission to reuse the software you'd already paid for and registered. When users screamed, Microsoft bent the rules. Now you'll be allowed to make some significant changes to your setup, over time: As first reported in depth in Scot Finnie's excellent newsletter, the WPA software is being adjusted to allow more latitude for such things as replacing network cards and graphics cards and adding RAM, without automatically triggering the need to reregister manually. Although the specifics aren't yet clear, the intent is to allow for normal, routine hardware changes over time, while still allowing Microsoft to detect wholesale cloning/pirating of software. However, even these "allowed" (gee, thanks) hardware changes will be communicated back to the Microsoft central database via the phone-home connection. Corporate customers also got a modest WPA change. Site-license holders can enter a master key code that obviates the need to separately register every machine in the company. (But it's unclear whether or not the phone-home activity stops; my read is that it does not and that could end up eating a lot of bandwidth in companies with many PCs.) Because Microsoft already has adjusted Windows Product Activation, perhaps there's some slim hope that further changes can be made. So, add your voice. What's your take on WPA? How do you feel about being forced to register your software? How do you feel about WPA monitoring your hardware setup? What about its phone-home activity? Or its ability to cripple your software setup? Do you think WPA will convert pirates into paying customers for Microsoft, or will it drive people to less-expensive, user-friendlier competitors? Will you use XP? Your voice is your vote--please join the discussion! ------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

Former Enron exec found dead
Officials: J. Clifford Baxter died of apparent suicide
The Associated Press
Published January 25, 2002, 11:48 AM CST
HOUSTON -- A former Enron Corp. executive who challenged the company's
questionable financial practices and resigned last May was found shot to
death in a car today, an apparent suicide, authorities said.
      Police in the suburb, Sugar Land, confirmed the death of 43-year-old
J. Clifford Baxter, a former Enron vice chairman. He was shot in the head.
      "We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our friend and
colleague, Cliff Baxter. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and
friends," the company said in a statement.
      Spokesman Mark Palmer had no additional comment.
      Baxter was vice chairman of Enron when he resigned in May 2001,
several months before the energy company's collapse.
      Baxter was identified by name in the explosive warning that Enron
executive Sherron Watkins wrote last August to company chairman Ken Lay.
      "Cliff Baxter complained mightily to (then-CEO Jeff) Skilling and all
who would listen about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM,"
one of the partnerships that kept hundreds of millions of dollars in debt
off Enron's books.

death a suicide.
      Baxter was one of 29 former and current Enron executives and board
members named as defendants in a federal lawsuit. Plaintiffs' lawyers said
the executives made $1.1 billion by selling Enron stock between October 1998
and November 2001.
      It said Baxter had sold 577,436 shares for $35.2 million.
      At the time his resignation was announced, Skilling said Baxter had
made "a tremendous contribution to Enron's evolution, particularly as a
member of the team that built Enron's wholesale business."
      It said his primary reason for resigning was to spend more time with
his family.
      Baxter had joined Enron in 1991 and was chairman and CEO of Enron
North America prior to being named chief strategy officer for Enron Corp. in
June 2000 and vice chairman in October 2000, the company said.

Reply-To: Law & Policy of Computer Communications Buy DVDs and games abroad - and break the law
By Drew Cullen
Posted: 24/01/2002 at 16:57 GMT
British consumers will be on the wrong side of the law for the first time if
they buy overseas DVDs or computer games 'unauthorised' for the UK and play
them on their PCs at home.
This is the major implication of a ruling in the High Court yesterday over
the sale in the UK of 'mod-chips' for the Sony Playstation.
However, there is tension between Jacob's ruling and explicit rights granted
to UK consumers through the Sale of Good Act (SGA) and the Unfair Contract
Terms Act (UCTA). But until a consumer, or a group of consumers, challenges
Jacob's ruling, the rights of copyright holders will take precedence.
In effect, the UK's Copyright and Patents Act 1988 gives copyright holders
more power than America's highly controversial Digital Millennium Copyright
Act (DMCA), because there are no exceptions, as Martin Keegan, of the
UK-based Campaign for Digital Rights points out.
He expresses concern at yesterday's ruling.
"Anti-circumvention law takes the balance in copyright law out of the hands
of Parliament and the judges, and places it in the hands of technologists
working for major media conglomerates.

New 'Emergency Health Powers Act' is dangerous expansion of state power
WASHINGTON, DC -- A new proposal that would grant governors the power to declare a "bioterrorism emergency" -- then seize property, order public quarantines, and ration food, guns, and alcohol -- appears to be a classic case of government overreaction, say Libertarians.
"This proposed legislation, which has been introduced in a dozen states already, gives governors astonishing powers, under vaguely defined guidelines, to combat a bioterrorism emergency that may never happen," said Steve Dasbach, executive director of the Libertarian Party.
"Even in light of the September 11 terrorist attacks, Americans should be very reluctant to grant governors these sweeping powers. Just because something is done in the name of 'combating terrorism' doesn't make it right, or necessary, or constitutional."
The draft Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (MEHPA), written by the Centers for Disease Control, is designed to help state governments cope with a sudden outbreak of smallpox, anthrax, or other bioterrorism attack. Health experts predict that every state will consider the 40-page model legislation at some point this year.
The legislation:
* Gives governors the power to declare a public health emergency, without consulting public health officials, the legislature, or the courts.
* Defines infectious disease as any "disease caused by a living organism," which "may, or may not, be transmissible from person to person, animal to person, or insect to person." Some health experts say the definition is so broad that it could include the outbreak of a dangerous flu or virus.
* Allows public health officials to mandate quarantines for people suspected of having an "infectious disease," and require vaccinations and medical exams. Doctors could be forced to provide them, and fined if they * Permits states to mobilize the "organized militia" to seize control of any private property the governor deems "reasonable and necessary" to cope with the emergency, such as "communication devices, real estate, fuels, food, clothing, and health care facilities."
* Allows the governor to destroy private property alleged to be hazardous to public health, in some cases without compensation.
* Empowers the state to "control and restrict alcoholic beverages, firearms, explosives, and combustibles."
The first problem with granting governors such awesome powers is that the definition of an "emergency" is so vague, said Dasbach. According to MEHPA, a public health emergency is "an occurrence or imminent threat of an illness or health condition...caused by bioterrorism...that poses a substantial risk of a significant number of human fatalities."
"Is a significant number five, the number of Americans already killed by the anthrax attacks?" he asked. "Is it 500? Is it 5,000? Unfortunately, if your state passes this legislation, a bioterrorism attack will be whatever your governor says it is."
Dasbach noted that the prestigious Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) warns that under the act, "there is no requirement for scientifically valid assessments, risk:benefit analysis, or judicial or even administrative review." The group's comments on the proposal, along with the text of the model legislation, can be viewed at
The second problem is that MEHPA appears to be an overreaction to a past government failure, said Dasbach.
"A primary function of the federal government, as defined in the Constitution, is to protect Americans against foreign attack," he noted. "On September 11, the government failed in that crucial role.
"Now, instead of reflexively expanding government power at the state level, perhaps it's time to ask why politicians were so unprepared in the first "Perhaps, if they weren't so busy squandering tax money on things like sports stadiums, museums, welfare programs, and business subsidies, they might already have a sensible, practical, limited bioterrorism response in place -- instead of having to scramble to pass a hastily written law that, frankly, should make every American apprehensive."

The New War on Cybercrime
By Paul A. Greenberg
E-Commerce Times
January 17, 2002
The positive side of the government's recent battle against cybercrime is
increased cooperation in catching online criminals.
The U.S. government has been quietly taking some giant steps forward over the
past few weeks in the fight against cybercrime. But just how serious are the
feds in tracking and punishing those who perpetrate crimes online?
In November, the Department of Defense (DOD) awarded a US$86 million contract
to Computer Sciences Corporation (NYSE: CSC) to train DOD cybercrime fighters.
That came just days after the U.S. and 29 other countries signed an
international treaty to fight online crime.
Also, in early December, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller created a new unit
specifically focused on fighting cybercrime. Meanwhile, the Bush administration
is adding at least 50 new federal cybercrime prosecutors across the U.S.
Pervasive Fraud
Much of the effort of the new prosecutors is to be aimed at fighting threats
and acts of terrorism communicated online or executed via the Internet.
Privately owned online businesses and individual consumers should ultimately
reap the rewards of the government's stepped up anti-cybercrime activities.
According to Jupiter Media Metrix, at least 25 cents of every $100 spent online
is lost to online fraud. Gartner Group claims Jupiter is underestimating the
problem. Gartner's own security research indicates losses could be as much as
10 times more than Jupiter's claim.
Either way, the perpetrators are becoming more savvy, more numerous and
increasingly aggressive.
High-Profile Battle
State law enforcement agencies and concerned online shoppers and merchants
would do well to keep an eye on the state of Virginia.
This week, U.S. Attorney Paul J. McNulty of northern Virginia and the FBI
formed a coalition to fight cybercrime, electronic terrorism, online child
pornography, software piracy and other criminal efforts that compromise the
security of online banks, utilities and essential services.
This is likely to be a high-profile war waged covertly but reported on widely.
Virginia intends to alert current and would-be cyber-criminals that the gig is
Just as McNulty's forces rallied and announced their intentions, the FBI
unveiled its own unprecedented cooperative cybercrime fighting effort with
local and state law enforcement, as well as the DOD and private industry.
Uphill Struggle
If there is a weakness involved in the fight it is simply that the good guys
are largely traditionalists schooled in conventional crime-fighting techniques,
while the perpetrators are well-versed in new economy technology and gifted at
finding electronic hiding places.
Those who run child pornography Web sites can easily operate well outside the
confines and jurisdiction of U.S. law enforcement, as can individuals who
operate illegal gambling sites.
Commonly, once the Feds turn up the heat, such Web site owners either close up
shop immediately, or simply take a breather and begin again later under a new
name or from another location.
Cohesive Crime-Fighting
The positive side of the government's recent battle against cybercrime is the
increased cooperation among various enforcement agencies and e-commerce
Up until now the fight was somewhat splintered. Industry did its best to act
independently in the fight, while government never seemed quite able to find
its place in the battle.
Still, legislators are split in their opinions about the new initiatives. Some,
such as Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) have publicly stated they believe the
Secret Service and the U.S. Customs offices are the appropriate agencies to
take on the fight.
Chances are, it is the unified effort of government and industry that will
ultimately prevail in what promises to be the crime war of the new century.

Associated Press Writer

SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A coalition of scientists and technology companies is
asking people around the world to use their computers' extra processing
power to help search for a cure for anthrax.
The project follows similar efforts to use "distributed computing" to hunt
for extraterrestrial life and a cure for cancer. It is being launched
Tuesday to help Oxford University researchers find ways to treat anthrax
that can no longer be treated by antibiotics.
The project is based on the premise that the average personal computer
uses between 13 percent and 18 percent of its processing power at any
given time. It employs "peer-to-peer" technology, in which millions of
computers can share files over the Internet.
Participants download a screen-saver that runs whenever their computers
have resources to spare, and uses that power to perform computations for
the project. When the user connects to the Internet, the computer sends
data back to a central hub and gets another assignment.
The company that designed the program, United Devices Inc. of Austin,
Texas, promises that no personal information on participants' PCs can be
compromised while they take part.
If the project attracts more than 160,000 participants, it can give
researchers more computational power than the world's 10 best
supercomputers combined, said United Devices spokesman Andy Prince.
"The screen-saver doesn't cost you anything, and at least you're taking
part in something, adding your bit," said Graham Richards, the Oxford
professor leading the study.
Scientists have discovered that the anthrax toxin is made up of three
proteins that are not toxic on their own but become toxic after binding
The Oxford scientists want to scan 3.5 billion molecular compounds to see
if any can block the process and keep the toxin from reproducing.
The results, which could serve as blueprints for late-stage anthrax drugs,
will be turned over to the U.S. and British governments, Richards said.
The project is funded by Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. and supported by
the National Foundation for Cancer Research.
A similar program launched last April, to help Richards' team find a
molecule that might counteract a protein involved in the growth of
leukemia, is harnessing the power of 1.3 million PCs around the world.
"We're now in a new era of computing directed at improving the quality of
life," said Pat Gelsinger, chief technology officer at Santa Clara-based

Netscape Files Suit Against Microsoft For Violations of the Antitrust Laws
Jan 22, 2002 04:03 PM
DULLES, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 22, 2002--Netscape
Communications Corporation today announced it has filed suit in the
United States Federal District Court in the District of Columbia
against Microsoft Corporation to seek redress for Microsoft's
anticompetitive conduct against Netscape, a subsidiary of America
Online. This anticompetitive conduct also formed the basis of the
government's antitrust case against Microsoft. A Federal District
Court concluded on June 7, 2000, and the Court of Appeals unanimously
affirmed on June 28th, 2001, that Microsoft's behavior violated the
antitrust laws and had harmed Netscape.
The seven-count lawsuit alleges that, beginning in 1995, Microsoft
harmed Netscape in a series of illegal acts aimed at promoting
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser at the expense of Netscape
Navigator, the innovative Web browser widely credited with having been
the catalyst for consumer adoption of the Internet. The suit seeks
injunctive relief sufficient to prevent further antitrust injury to
Netscape, and an award of treble damages to be determined at trial.

Homeland Security Agency - The Police State
September 28, 2001
Posted by Michael Bunker mbunker
"Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings
of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against
the Lord and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands
asunder, and cast away their cords from us." - Psalm 2:1-3
September 28, 2001 -- In 1998, I began laying out how state-sponsored
terrorist activity was being used to bring about a Police State in this
country. In 1999, I said that a major terrorist attack, blamed on Osama
Bin Ladin, would be used to bring in this Police State. Let me make one
more prediction that might shock a few people. The announcement by the
White House that the executive branch will NOT call for a National ID
Card, GUARANTEES one thing, and you can take this to the bank:
THERE WILL BE ANOTHER LARGE-SCALE TERRORIST ATTACK VERY, VERY SOON.
Another devastating terrorist attack on U.S. soil will galvanize support
for the National Identification Card that does not exist today. Support
for a National ID Card, with a "unique biometric identifier" grew after
the attack on the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City. The idea suffered a
major defeat in Congress in October of 2000, but rebounded immediately
after the attack on the U.S.S. Cole that same month. Support skyrocketed
again after the September 11th attacks, but the Bush people can easily see
that a consensus doesn't yet exist. So they announced yesterday that they
would not seek a National ID Card for all Americans.
Wait a little while. Too much money has been invested in the National ID.
The General Services Administration (GSA) has been operating their
cashless society "Common ID" pilot program for some time. We showed you
the GSA ID card in our third technology video. Do a cursory check of their
website:  and you will see what I mean. Watch my
third video and you will also see how the GSA, the National Institute of
Standards (NIST), Visionics (home of FACIAL RECOGNITION), and our own Bush
appointed Transportation Secretary (Norman Mineta) have been pushing for
this surveillance and tracking technology since long before Bush came into
What we are seeing is NOT the massive onslaught of Martial Law that many
people have been predicting over the years. We are watching the slow
phase-in of "emergency powers", and Homeland Security is the reason for
the season.
Welcome to the tyranny of "Homeland Security"
The only debate taking place in Washington D.C., is exactly HOW MUCH
authority, this new omnipresent police agency will have. The president is
creating this new cabinet-level agency by executive fiat, while the
Congress is rushing to provide Legislative "cover" for the plan, by
offering to extend even more authority to the president to enact Homeland
Defense. Congress is afraid that Bush appointee Tom Ridge will not have
enough authority, so they are moving to write legislation that will create
a security "super-agency" to coordinate the activities of more than 40
federal agencies and departments, including the CIA and the FBI, and the
ATF. George W. Bush is not waiting for any congressional authority.
Spokesman, Scott McClellan said, "The president is moving forward to
create the Office of Homeland Security by presidential action."
One citizen watchdog group, Concerned Citizens Opposed to Police States
(CCOPS) had this to say about this new "super-agency":
"The new Homeland Defense Agency is the lynchpin of a plan that
extensively reorganizes both the executive and legislative functions of
the U.S. government. Among other things, the plan makes the National Guard
a national police force. It extensively federalizes both the study and the
work of science, mathematics, and engineering. It creates numerous new
sub-bureaucracies. The Homeland Security agency itself is to "be built
upon the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with the three organizations
currently on the front line of border security-the Coast Guard, the
Customs Service, and the Border Patrol- transferred to it." The plan calls
for the new agency to oversee activities of the Department of Defense, as
well as to assume a variety of duties now held by agencies from the
Department of Commerce to the FBI. When the plan was announced in January
of this year, the media barely covered it, and shortly thereafter, the
plan itself, and the government Web site created expressly for
 it, dropped out of sight. We found the full text of the report at only
one location: Today we can see the effects of what I can only call - Undeclared Martial
Law. State governors around the country are racing (at Bush's command) to
call up National Guardsmen to patrol the nations 420 largest airports. It
has been reported that National Guardsmen will also patrol near Nuclear
Reactors, Power Plants and other mission-critical facilities. New York
City, and many other cities are being virtually locked down. Any vehicles
going into or out of these areas are subject to random, warrantless
On the very same day that George W. Bush and the administration claimed
that they were going to try to revitalize our faith in the security and
safety of commercial air travel, they also announced that they were
extending "shoot-down" authority to the U.S. military, should they need to
splash a commercial jet while it is in flight. I am not commenting here on
whether or not the U.S. military should have the right to shoot down any
commercial jets that pose a direct threat to life and property - but I am
saying that any third-grader can see that the administrations stated goal,
to alleviate the well grounded fears of the flying public, was merely a PR
scam that had no hope of being successful.
During several White House Press Conferences by Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer, Mr. Fleischer has warned the public about "unacceptable
speech." In a Press Conference dated today (September 28, 2001), the
following statement was made by Mr. Fleischer in regards to comments made
by Politically Incorrect television host Bill Maher:
"MR. FLEISCHER: I think that everybody always has to be thoughtful. I
think everybody has to think through the repercussions, the implications
of what they say. And I shared this morning, as well, but I had a message
on my answering machine from somebody, a citizen who called up and said
that the United States needs to round up all the Muslims, the good ones
and the bad ones, because you can't tell the difference. And that's the
type of thing -- people have to think carefully about the things that they
do and they say. And our nation, as it goes into an increased wartime
footing, is going to be confronting issues that typically, thankfully,
have not come up in the past, that make people think more carefully about
what they're doing."
So free speech may also be a victim to our preparations for an "increased
wartime footing". And we must also mention the abrogation of all rights to
privacy due to the FBI's placement of "Carnivore" spying units at critical
hubs on the Internet. We will also have to recognize that the right to
keep and bear arms is still under an unrelenting attack. Days ago, the
Congress approved a White House request for $50 million in additional
funding for the unconstitutional and abusive thugs at the Federal Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
So let us take inventory:
Limitations on the right to free speech Limitations or elimination of the right to bear arms Militarized police performing random warrantless searches Military units patrolling "secure areas", and manning checkpoints Severe restrictions on the right to travel Obliteration of the right to privacy
This is what we face GOING IN TO our "increased wartime footing". Mr.
Ridge doesn't even assume his newly created position until October 8th of
this year. It is already crystal clear to me what his new "position"
America is waving the flag heartily as they enter into a fascist New World
Democrats and Republicans are marching in lockstep unity, the pied pipers
of a global police state.
How's that workin' out for ya?

"[The DPPA] is a valid exercise of federal authority... ."
"The DPPA is a legitimate exercise of Congresss authority... ."
"For these reasons, we respectfully urge the Court to reverse the decision
of the lower court [and uphold the DPPA]."
Scott McDonald, FightTheFingerprint, January 13, 2000:
"The ruling ... by the US Supreme Court [upholding the Driver's Privacy
Protection Act] paves the way for Big Brother to establish centralized
databases on every citizen."
"[Under DPPA] records may be used to establish a database of driver's
records that will be used to 'prevent fraud.' This exception will likely
result in the development of a central database of all drivers from across
the country, effectively creating a single national identification database
managed by Big Brother."
AAMVA President and CEO, Linda Lewis, January 14, 2002:
"I mentioned originally the Driver's Privacy Protection Act. What that
Privacy Act [DPPA] does, it allows for fourteen permissible uses of motor
vehicle record data. So when you ask me, 'Do motor vehicles share data?',
yes, they do, but they do it according to the [DPPA] law."
Scott McDonald, FightTheFingerprint, January 13, 2000:
"This DPPA law is the worst thing that could have happened to anyone who
regards their personal information as 'theirs' and 'private.' This Act
wrests control over private information held by the states away from the
states and citizens and places it instead in the hands of a centralized
federal government which has already expressed its intentions of developing
central databases of drivers' photos and identifying data."
"Some news outlets which do not fully understand the long-range implications
of the DPPA -- and the true anti-privacy, big government motives behind its
implementation -- have praised the Court's DPPA ruling. This is a huge
mistake which will be proven out over the coming years as more and more
centralized databases are established using drivers license and motor
vehicle records collected under the authority of the DPPA."
AAMVA President and CEO, Linda Lewis, January 14, 2002:
"Well, there's a lot of misinformation being circulated, communicated,
printed, about this huge database in the sky. And let's try to get the
record straight once and for all as to what we're trying to do here. What
we're trying to do is to connect databases that motor vehicle agencies
currently have in place so that they are able to exchange information
about drivers... ."
"By legislating and funding technology such as the Driver Record
Identification Verification System, known as DRIVerS, state agencies and
federal agencies such as the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the
Social Security Administration, the Bureau of Vital Statistics -- and if
necessary the Federal Bureau of Investigations -- can share information."
Scott McDonald, FightTheFingerprint, January 17, 2000:
"Prior to the DPPA ruling, no state could be "required" to participate in
any of these federal driver registry database programs; the federal
government formerly had no mechanism to force state participation. States
were coaxed into participation through the use of federal grants and
funding-contingent programs. Prior to the DPPA ruling, not all states were
fully cooperating with central database efforts."
"The DPPA will now force states to cooperate with development of these and
other federal registries of driver information and records. Under the
authority granted by the DPPA, a central registry of every driver in every
state will be developed with resultant equivalency of a national
identification database."
AAMVA President and CEO, Linda Lewis, January 14, 2002:
"Our intent is to establish a Driver Record Identification System, that for
every driver or person contained therein there is only one license, there
is only one record, and there is only one identity."
"The cost of developing that system comes from the need to have what we
call a unique identifier that allows us to determine me from you from
someone else that has a similar name in the system."
"We are very experienced with partnering with the federal government to
develop these types of systems."

   Canadian judge pans new international court: Arbour says
   rules shield world's worst criminals
   BY: David Rider
   DATELINE: TORONTO
   With a permanent international court finally set to become reality, a
   Supreme Court of Canada judge and former war crimes prosecutor is
   worried governments have been handed a "major trump card" to shield
   some of the world's worst criminals.
   Justice Louise Arbour -- an international legal figure who indicted
   former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic -- told a forum she's
   deeply concerned that the borderless court will get involved only when
   a nation is "unwilling" or "unable" to prosecute a case itself.
   It's fairly easy to determine when a state is unable to try someone
   for genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes, said Judge
   Arbour, who was chief prosecutor for the United Nations tribunals for
   Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia until her appointment to Canada's top
   court in 1999. For example, Rwanda couldn't hold its own genocide
   trials because few lawyers and judges survived the 1994 massacre.
   However, under rules of the International Criminal Court (ICC) treaty
   drafted at a Canadian-chaired meeting in Rome in 1998, national courts
   have primacy -- even when the state's leaders are themselves
   implicated -- and the onus is on international prosecutors to prove
   that any fraudulent investigations and trials aren't "genuine."
   A long-standing proponent of a permanent court to judge the worst
   crimes against civilians, Judge Arbour called the rule a "very, very
   bad idea."
   States with relatively developed legal systems will have a "major
   trump card" to evade justice and will clash with developing countries
   that don't, she said.
   "That clash will be intensely political, so I think the reality is
   that the ICC risks becoming the true default jurisdiction for
   developing countries, and is buying into major political legal battles
   with everybody else," she said.
   A dream of human rights activists since the Second World War, the new
   court is set to become a fact when 60 countries ratify the Rome
   treaty.
   Forty-eight, including Canada, have already done so and the magic
   number is expected to be reached by about mid-April.
   However, holdouts include the United States and most observers believe
   its money and political clout are critical to the court's long-term
   success.
   Judge Arbour said the merits of the court's existence are "yesterday's
   debate" and speculated that the U.S. will become tacitly involved when
   the UN security council, on which the U.S. sits, refers cases to the
   new court.
   "My concern is not that (the court) is too ambitious but that it is
   not ambitious enough," she said, adding it would be a mistake to build
   the court on the Canadian judicial template. For example, prosecutors
   will need more power to protect the safety of witnesses and to get
   information from state intelligence agencies than they have under the
   Canadian system.
   She called the court's development "highly complex, immensely
   challenging but immensely do-able and, for all these reasons, just."

Anthrax Missing From Army Lab
January 20, 2002
By JACK DOLAN And DAVE ALTIMARI, Courant Staff Writers
Lab specimens of anthrax spores, Ebola virus and other pathogens disappeared
from the Army's biological warfare research facility in the early 1990s,
during a turbulent period of labor complaints and recriminations among rival
scientists there, documents from an internal Army inquiry show.
The 1992 inquiry also found evidence that someone was secretly entering a
lab late at night to conduct unauthorized research, apparently involving
anthrax. A numerical counter on a piece of lab equipment had been rolled
back to hide work done by the mystery researcher, who left the misspelled
label "antrax" in the machine's electronic memory, according to the
documents obtained by The Courant.
Experts disagree on whether the lost specimens pose a danger. An Army
spokesperson said they do not because they would have been effectively
killed by chemicals in preparation for microscopic study. A prominent
molecular biologist said, however, that resilient anthrax spores could
possibly be retrieved from a treated specimen.
In addition, a scientist who once worked at the Army facility said that
because of poor inventory controls, it is possible some of the specimens
disappeared while still viable, before being treated.
Not in dispute is what the incidents say about disorganization and lack of
security in some quarters of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of
Infectious Diseases - known as USAMRIID - at Fort Detrick, Md., in the
1990s. Fort Detrick is believed to be the original source of the Ames strain
of anthrax used in the mail attacks last fall, and investigators have
questioned people there and at a handful of other government labs and
It is unclear whether Ames was among the strains of anthrax in the 27 sets
of specimens reported missing at Fort Detrick after an inventory in 1992.
The Army spokesperson, Caree Vander-Linden, said that at least some of the
lost anthrax was not Ames. But a former lab technician who worked with some
of the anthrax that was later reported missing said all he ever handled was
the Ames strain.
Meanwhile, one of the 27 sets of specimens has been found and is still in
the lab; an Army spokesperson said it may have been in use when the
inventory was taken. The fate of the rest, some containing samples no larger
than a pencil point, remains unclear. In addition to anthrax and Ebola, the
specimens included hanta virus, simian AIDS virus and two that were labeled
"unknown" - an Army euphemism for classified research whose subject was
A former commander of the lab said in an interview he did not believe any of
the missing specimens were ever found. Vander-Linden said last week that in
addition to the one complete specimen set, some samples from several others
were later located, but she could not provide a fuller accounting because of
incomplete records regarding the disposal of specimens.
"In January of 2002, it's hard to say how many of those were missing in
February of 1991," said Vander-Linden, adding that it's likely some were
simply thrown out with the trash.
Discoveries of lost specimens and unauthorized research coincided with an
Army inquiry into allegations of "improper conduct" at Fort Detrick's
experimental pathology branch in 1992. The inquiry did not substantiate the
specific charges of mismanagement by a handful of officers.
But a review of hundreds of pages of interview transcripts, signed
statements and internal memos related to the inquiry portrays a climate
charged with bitter personal rivalries over credit for research, as well as
allegations of sexual and ethnic harassment. The recriminations and
unhappiness ultimately became a factor in the departures of at least five
frustrated Fort Detrick scientists.
In interviews with The Courant last month, two of the former scientists said
that as recently as 1997, when they left, controls at Fort Detrick were so
lax it wouldn't have been hard for someone with security clearance for its
handful of labs to smuggle out biological specimens.
Lost Samples
The 27 specimens were reported missing in February 1992, after a new
officer, Lt. Col. Michael Langford, took command of what was viewed by Fort
Detrick brass as a dysfunctional pathology lab. Langford, who no longer
works at Fort Detrick, said he ordered an inventory after he recognized
there was "little or no organization" and "little or no accountability" in
the lab.
"I knew we had to basically tighten up what I thought was a very lax and
unorganized system," he said in an interview last week.
A factor in Langford's decision to order an inventory was his suspicion -
never proven - that someone in the lab had been tampering with records of
specimens to conceal unauthorized research. As he explained later to Army
investigators, he asked a lab technician, Charles Brown, to "make a list of
everything that was missing."
"It turned out that there was quite a bit of stuff that was unaccounted for,
which only verifies that there needs to be some kind of accountability down
there," Langford told investigators, according to a transcript of his April
1992 interview.
Brown - whose inventory was limited to specimens logged into the lab during
the 1991 calendar year - detailed his findings in a two-page memo to
Langford, in which he lamented the loss of the items "due to their immediate
and future value to the pathology division and USAMRIID."
Many of the specimens were tiny samples of tissue taken from the dead bodies
of lab animals infected with deadly diseases during vaccine research.
Standard procedure for the pathology lab would be to soak the samples in a
formaldehyde-like fixative and embed them in a hard resin or paraffin, in
preparation for study under an electron microscope.
Some samples, particularly viruses, are also irradiated with gamma rays
before they are handled by the pathology lab.
Whether all of the lost samples went through this treatment process is
unclear. Vander-Linden said the samples had to have been rendered inert if
they were being worked on in the pathology lab.
But Dr. Ayaad Assaad, a former Fort Detrick scientist who had extensive
dealings with the lab, said that because some samples were received at the
lab while still alive - with the expectation they would be treated before
being worked on - it is possible some became missing before treatment. A
phony "log slip" could then have been entered into the lab computer, making
it appear they had been processed and logged.
In fact, Army investigators appear to have wondered if some of the anthrax
specimens reported missing had ever really been logged in. When an
investigator produced a log slip and asked Langford if "these exist or [are
they] just made up on a data entry form," Langford replied that he didn't
Assuming a specimen was chemically treated and embedded for microscopic
study, Vander-Linden and several scientists interviewed said it would be
impossible to recover a viable pathogen from them. Brown, who did the
inventory for Langford and has since left Fort Detrick, said in an interview
that the specimens he worked on in the lab "were completely inert."
"You could spread them on a sandwich," he said.
But Dr. Barbara Hatch Rosenberg, a molecular biologist at the State
University of New York who is investigating the recent anthrax attacks for
the Federation of American Scientists, said she would not rule out the
possibility that anthrax in spore form could survive the chemical-fixative
"You'd have to grind it up and hope that some of the spores survived,"
Rosenberg said. "It would be a mess.
"It seems to me that it would be an unnecessarily difficult task. Anybody
who had access to those labs could probably get something more useful."
Rosenberg's analysis of the anthrax attacks, which has been widely reported,
concludes that the culprit is probably a government insider, possibly
someone from Fort Detrick. The Army facility manufactured anthrax before
biological weapons were banned in 1969, and it has experimented with the
Ames strain for defensive research since the early 1980s.
Vander-Linden said that one of the two sets of anthrax specimens listed as
missing at Fort Detrick was the Vollum strain, which was used in the early
days of the U.S. biological weapons program. It was not clear what the type
of anthrax in the other missing specimen was.
Eric Oldenberg, a soldier and pathology lab technician who left Fort Detrick
and is now a police detective in Phoenix, said in an interview that Ames was
the only anthrax strain he worked with in the lab.
Late-Night Research
More troubling to Langford than the missing specimens was what investigators
called "surreptitious" work being done in the pathology lab late at night
and on weekends.
Dr. Mary Beth Downs told investigators that she had come to work several
times in January and February of 1992 to find that someone had been in the
lab at odd hours, clumsily using the sophisticated electron microscope to
conduct some kind of off-the-books research.
After one weekend in February, Downs discovered that someone had been in the
lab using the microscope to take photos of slides, and apparently had
forgotten to reset a feature on the microscope that imprints each photo with
a label. After taking a few pictures of her own slides that morning, Downs
was surprised to see "Antrax 005" emblazoned on her negatives.
Downs also noted that an automatic counter on the camera, like an odometer
on a car, had been rolled back to hide the fact that pictures had been taken
over the weekend. She wrote of her findings in a memo to Langford, noting
that whoever was using the microscope was "either in a big hurry or didn't
know what they were doing."
It is unclear if the Army ever got to the bottom of the incident, and some
lab insiders believed concerns about it were overblown. Brown said many Army
officers did not understand the scientific process, which he said doesn't
always follow a 9-to-5 schedule.
"People all over the base knew that they could come in at anytime and get on
the microscope," Brown said. "If you had security clearance, the guard isn't
going to ask you if you are qualified to use the equipment. I'm sure people
used it often without our knowledge."
Documents from the inquiry show that one unauthorized person who was
observed entering the lab building at night was Langford's predecessor, Lt.
Col. Philip Zack, who at the time no longer worked at Fort Detrick. A
surveillance camera recorded Zack being let in at 8:40 p.m. on Jan. 23,
1992, apparently by Dr. Marian Rippy, a lab pathologist and close friend of
Zack's, according to a report filed by a security guard.
Zack could not be reached for comment. In an interview this week, Rippy said
that she doesn't remember letting Zack in, but that he occasionally stopped
by after he was transferred off the base.
"After he left, he had no [authorized] access to the building. Other people
let him in," she said. "He knew a lot of people there and he was still part
of the military. I can tell you, there was no suspicious stuff going on
there with specimens."
Zack left Fort Detrick in December 1991, after a controversy over
allegations of unprofessional behavior by Zack, Rippy, Brown and others who
worked in the pathology division. They had formed a clique that was accused
of harassing the Egyptian-born Assaad, who later sued the Army, claiming
Assaad said he had believed the harassment was behind him until last
October, until after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
He said that is when the FBI contacted him, saying someone had mailed an
anonymous letter - a few days before the existence of anthrax-laced mail
became known - naming Assaad as a potential bioterrorist. FBI agents decided
the note was a hoax after interviewing Assaad.
But Assaad said he believes the note's timing makes the author a suspect in
the anthrax attacks, and he is convinced that details of his work contained
in the letter mean the author must be a former Fort Detrick colleague.
Brown said that he doesn't know who sent the letter, but that Assaad's
nationality and expertise in biological agents made him an obvious subject
of concern after Sept. 11.

UK seeks US explanation of Guantanamo prisoner photos
AP [ SUNDAY, JANUARY 20, 2002  11:26:33 PM ]
ONDON: Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Sunday he had told British
representatives at Guantanamo Bay to ask American officials for an
explanation of photographs showing al-Qaeda and Taliban suspects wearing
blacked-out goggles and earmuffs.
The photos from the U.S. naval base in Cuba, released by American officials,
show the men kneeling on the ground in handcuffs with masks over their
mouths and noses and mittens on their hands.
They were displayed prominently in many British newspapers and on television
Sunday - The Mail tabloid ran the headline "Tortured" over one of the
photos - and contributed to mounting concerns here about American treatment
of the prisoners.
"I have asked our officials in Guantanamo Bay to establish with the U.S. the
circumstances in which these photographs were taken," Straw said in a
"The British government's position is that prisoners -regardless of their
technical status - should be treated humanely and in accordance with
customary international law," Straw said. "We have always made that clear
and the Americans have said they share this view."
Straw said he was awaiting a report from a team of British officials
visiting Guantanamo, where three Britons are believed to be among the 100
The U.S. government calls the prisoners "unlawful combatants" or "detainees"
rather than prisoners of war with assigned legal rights under the Geneva
Conventions, but insists they are being treated humanely.
Human rights groups and some British politicians have criticized the
treatment of the prisoners. Prime Minister Tony Blair has sought to balance
defending U.S. authorities with insisting the prisoners' human rights must
be guaranteed. He has called the prisoners "very dangerous people," but
insisted they must be treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.
A group of British parliamentarians asked on Saturday to meet the U.S.
ambassador to express their concerns about the treatment of the prisoners.
Ann Clwyd, chairwoman of Parliament's Human Rights Committee, said members
wanted assurances from Ambassador William Farish that the detainees were
considered prisoners of war.
"It's time we had a clear statement," she said. "We fought the war shoulder
to shoulder, now it seems that we are being frozen out of the aftermath."
Menzies Campbell, foreign affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrat party,
said the photographs would damage the credibility of the international
anti-terrorism coalition.
"I don't believe that we will successfully fight a campaign against terror
if we publicly treat people in the way in which these photographs suggest,"
he told Sky News. "You only have to ask yourself the question 'What sort of
effect will these pictures have in capitals like, for example, Cairo, or
Amman in Jordan?"'
"We do not set the standards by which we treat prisoners by the standards
which al-Qaeda or the Taliban might have used," he continued. "It is
precisely because our standards are different and better and superior that
we were engaged in the military action in Afghanistan."

Commercial database use flagged
By William Matthews
Jan. 16, 2002
Privacy advocates have filed a lawsuit in federal court to force the Justice
and Treasury departments to disclose details about buying information about
individuals from commercial databases. The agencies are generally banned
from amassing such information on their own.
Electronic Privacy Information Center officials said Jan. 15 that the two
agencies have illegally failed to respond to Freedom of Information Act
requests for details about their information purchasing practices.
Lawyers for EPIC sought the information after seeing news reports and
obtaining documents that indicate at least six federal law enforcement
agencies buy personal information from database companies.
The companies include ChoicePoint Inc., which gathers and sells information
for purposes ranging from employment background checks to insurance fraud
investigations, and Experian, which claims to have information gathered from
"hundreds of public and proprietary sources" on 215 million consumers.
The Privacy Act of 1974 banned federal agencies from collecting personal
information about individuals unless they are actively investigating the
individual. But no such prohibitions apply to database companies.
The companies collect data from a wide range of commercial and government
sources, such as credit card records, motor vehicle and property records,
license records, marriage and divorce data, bankruptcy and other court
databases, product warranty registrations, loan applications and other
Government agencies that buy the information include the FBI, the Drug
Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Marshals Service, the Internal Revenue
Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, according to EPIC.
A key concern for privacy advocates is how accurate the data is, said Chris
Hoofnagle, EPIC's legislative counsel who filed the suit. ChoicePoint, for
example, provided inaccurate data to Florida election officials, who denied
thousands of voters access to the polls in 2000.
Hoofnagle said EPIC obtained documents that show that information the IRS
bought from ChoicePoint and Experian included "credit header data," which
includes a person's name, current and prior addresses, Social Security
number, date of birth, telephone number, information from property records,
motor vehicle records, marriage licenses and divorce papers, and records of
international asset location. IRS employees have access to this data through
their desktop computers, Hoofnagle said.
It is not clear whether the agencies buying information are violating the
law, "but if they are buying information without real investigations going
on, then there are going to be problems," he said.
The Privacy Act was passed to stop information collection abuses that were
common during the 1960s and 1970s, when the FBI and other agencies compiled
detailed dossiers on Vietnam War protesters, civil rights activists,
political "enemies" of the president, celebrities and others.
Hoofnagle said recent cases show that the abuse of information by government
employees has not ended. Recent abuses include police employees using
information to track women for dates and to rob rental cars and federal
employees selling DEA data, he said.
"You don't have to have a rogue government, just a rogue civil servant," he
The Justice Department has 30 days to respond to the suit.

@_subject: UK Opting out of European Convention on Human Rights 
Europe debates anti-terror laws
     _________________________________________________________________
   LONDON, England -- The UK Parliament has begun the process of
   approving legislation to let authorities detain some suspected
   terrorists indefinitely without trial.
   The proposal, put forward by Home Secretary David Blunkett, has drawn
   complaints from some lawmakers that it is being rushed through
   Parliament and that alternatives should be found that do not violate
   human rights laws.
   But on Monday government members of Parliament followed the Labour
   Party line, supported by opposition parties, and approved the first
   stage of the plan by 458 votes to five.
   The government wants the Anti-Terrorism, Security and Crime Bill
   approved before Christmas and timetabled just three days for members
   of Parliament to debate the measure.
   An order allowing Britain to opt out from part of the European
   Convention on Human Rights would make the indefinite detention of
   terror suspects possible.
   Blunkett has defended the proposal, saying it would require annual
   renewal and would only apply to suspects who could not be deported or
   extradited.
   "No one is going macho, no one's trying to do this for the sake of
   promoting some sort of vitriolic or anti-human rights agenda,"
   Blunkett told BBC television.
   "The security and anti-terrorist services say that there are people
   ... who we would normally be able to remove from the country but at
   the moment they would be able to claim habeas corpus and stop me being
   able to remove them," he said.
   "I could remove them if they had a safe country to go to, I could of
   course extradite them where extradition has been agreed with a
   particular country. If I can't actually remove somebody because they
   would be tortured or murdered, I will detain them instead."
   The plan has also come in for criticism from civil rights groups.
   John Wadham, director of the civil rights group Liberty, said: "This
   is a fundamental violation of the rule of law, our rights and
   traditional British values."
   Britain is not the first European country to consider tightening its
   anti-terror laws in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United
   States, where a number of new laws also have been put into place --
   including a presidential order allowing non-U.S. citizens accused of
   terrorism to be tried in military tribunals rather than civilian
   courts.
   Germany has pledged an extra $1.4 billion next year for a security
   crackdown, and the government has introduced an anti-terror package
   that includes upgrading identification cards for non-nationals living
   in there.
   The new package was agreed only after days of argument over how to
   prevent terror attacks being planned or executed in Germany while
   protecting civil liberties.
   But reports that Interior Minister Otto Schily wanted federal police
   to have the right to carry out searches without a court warrant were
   met with wide-ranging criticism from civil rights groups and warnings
   from within Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's coalition that such powers
   were forbidden by the country's post-war constitution.
   In France, the parliament has approved a package of tougher
   anti-terror measures that Interior Minister Daniel Vaillant said was a
   response to "exceptional circumstances."
   The new measures, which will be in force through 2003, give police the
   right to search cars and access private phone calls and e-mail.
   The strengthened laws will allow police to search car boots on the
   instructions of a prosecutor in terrorist inquiries. Until now cars
   were off-limits to police.
   The amendments also allow bag and body searches at places such as
   airports, stadiums and stores, and enable police to carry out
   nighttime searches in storage spaces and garages during preliminary
   investigations. Previously, they had to wait until 6 a.m.
   The plan also allows investigative judges to demand that phone or
   Internet companies save wiretapped conversations and Internet data for
   up to a year.
   The 15-member European Union has taken collective anti-terror measures
   on a number of related issues, including money laundering.
   "We are taking collectively very big decisions -- for (powers of)
   arrest, for money laundering -- in all the chapters where we need new
   cooperation against terrorists," European Commission President Romano
   Prodi told BBC radio.
   Since September 11, EU finance, justice and transport ministers have
   jointly endorsed measures to combat global terrorism, including a move
   to apply money-laundering rules to various serious crimes in addition
   to the drugs trade.
   They also pledged to freeze assets of terrorists and their
   organisations and boost airport and aircraft security.
   In the United States, President George W. Bush signed an order last
   week giving him the option of trying non-U.S. citizens suspected of
   terrorism before a special military commission instead of civilian
   courts.
   Senior administration officials have told CNN that the proceedings
   could be secret and could be held in the United States or overseas.
   U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft has voiced his support for the
   decision, saying there was no reason a suspected terrorist captured in
   another nation should be brought back to the United States for trial.
   "Foreign terrorists who commit war crimes against the United States in
   my judgment are not entitled to, do not deserve the protections of the
   American Constitution," Ashcroft said.
   Ashcroft also has ordered law enforcement personnel to question more
   than 5,000 young men who entered the United States in the past two
   years.
   More than 1,100 people have been detained or arrested in the U.S. as
   part of the ongoing terrorist investigation.

US anti-terror war stirs HR concerns
Reuters, Washington/Kabul
US efforts to hunt down terror suspects around the world after the September
11 attacks prompted fresh concern among rights watchdogs on Friday when
American troops seized six Algerians in Bosnia.
The leading suspect, Osama bin Laden, is still at large, but Pakistani
President Pervez Musharraf sparked a new round of speculation about his fate
when he said the al-Qaida leader could have died from kidney failure.
The White House said it would welcome news of the death of the presumed
mastermind behind the attacks on the World Trade Centre and Pentagon that
killed about 3,100 people, but said the United States had no idea what had
happened to him.
In Sarajevo, the US Embassy said American forces had taken custody of six
Algerians detained by Bosnian authorities in October on suspicion of
involvement in terrorism but released this week by a local court.
The six are to be transferred to a US internment camp in Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, where more than 100 captives from the war in Afghanistan against the
Taliban and al-Qaida are already being held.
Human rights groups have criticized conditions at the camp captives are held
in chain-link enclosures and are not accorded prisoner of war status and the
seizure of the six men in Bosnia prompted a fresh outcry.
"It's very disappointing," Madeleine Rees, head of the Bosnia office of the
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said of the US action. "It violates
the rule of law."
The US Embassy said Washington acted because the six "Posed a credible
security threat to US personnel and facilities and demonstrated involvement
in international terrorism."
In New York, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, without referring directly to
the prisoner transfer, said governments should not violate human rights in
the war on terrorism.

@_subject: The United States of Enron 
->  SNETNEWS  Mailing List
January 19, 2002 The United States of Enron By FRANK RICH Wasn't that the best?" said a laughing Ann Richards this week, when I asked her reaction to President Bush's effort to hide behind her skirt when questioned about Enron. "It was so silly. Why didn't he just say Ken Lay was a strong supporter and gave him a half-million dollars and is a good friend, and he's really sorry Ken's in these terrible circumstances?"  Good question. As the world knows now, George W. Bush told two lies when first asked about his ties to the top guy in what may prove the largest corporate flimflam in history. The president said (1) that he only "got to know" Mr. Lay in 1994, when in fact their relationship goes back at least to 1992; and (2) that Mr. Lay "was a supporter" of Governor Richards, when in fact Mr. Lay told TV's "Frontline" last year that he "did support" Mr. Bush over Ms. Richards in their Texas race.  This is the president who promised to usher America into "a new era of personal responsibility"?  What makes the dissembling so strange is that there is no evidence of any administration illegality in the Enron affair. And yet each day brings a new half-truth or seeming cover-up. Appearing on CNN last Saturday, Lawrence Lindsey, the top Bush economic adviser and a former Enron consultant, seconded the president's effort to pin Ken Lay on Ann Richards, but somehow forgot to say what would become public four days later  that he had overseen an administration study of the impact of Enron's travails in October. Earlier, Mary Matalin had visited the Imus show to defend her boss, Dick Cheney, but instead of vowing to open the books on the secret meetings between Enron and the vice president's clandestine energy task force, she asserted that Enron got "not one thing" from the administration's energy plan (actually it got plenty) and tried desperately to dismiss the entire ruckus as lacking an intern's "blue dress."  Hard as it is to believe, it was only 10 days ago that Ari Fleischer declared, "I'm not aware of anybody in the White House who discussed Enron's financial situation." Now we're painfully aware that the only White House inhabitants who may not have discussed it are the president, Barney and Spot  or so we must believe until future investigators turn up a smoking pretzel.  Washington, meanwhile, is busy debating whether Enron the Scandal is as hot as Whitewater. This should be a no-brainer. While The Wall Street Journal published an encyclopedic series of tomes to parse a low- rent Arkansas land scam to a public that never did quite understand it, everyone instantly gets an epic fraud in which arrogant high-fliers stacked the deck to fleece thousands of peons to the tune of zillions.  For a quick cultural index of this story's allure, check out the hundreds of hotly contested Enron lots on Ebay, where the bankrupt company's stock certificates have gone for north of $200  a multiple of 300 times the last known value of a share of the stock itself. And, Ms. Matalin notwithstanding, this scandal is not sex-free. Not only did Enron approach Penthouse and Playboy to try to enter the porn business, as The Times has reported, but we learn in Fortune that "rumors of sexual high jinks" in Enron's executive suites "ran rampant." A nation that doted on the soap operatics of "Dallas" may have at long last found a worthy sequel in "Houston." Once the "sexual high jinks" kick in, it could play 24/7 on cable, with or without Paula Zahn.  The Washington wisdom that Enron has no legs  that it's not a political scandal, merely a financial one  is based on the premise that the Bush administration didn't ride to Ken Lay's rescue once disaster struck. But what about the favors performed for Enron before the meltdown? That's as political as you can get, particularly since, unlike Whitewater, this scandal implicates both parties and the corrupt campaign finance system that makes them look like interchangeable vending machines for their often overlapping patrons.  Though the Bush administration has been in office only a year, Enron's oily fingerprints are all over its actions as well as its résumés and stock portfolios. Mr. Lay helped hand-pick the head of the government agency in charge of regulating his own business and stood to gain a $254 million corporate tax rebate in the administration-blessed stimulus bill (despite the fact that Enron used almost 900 offshore "subsidiaries" to avoid paying any income taxes at all in four of the last five years). The Enron old-boy network may even have played a backdoor role in the life-and-death matter of stem cell policy. When President Bush announced his stem cell "compromise" in August, many top researchers criticized it as an obstacle to medical progress. But miraculously the administration was able to produce an instant endorsement from John Mendelsohn of the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston  who we now know is an Enron board member whose institution received $600,000 in Enron lucre.  The Clinton Democrats had eight years of Enron exposure, and while never receiving remotely the sums that the Republicans did, nonetheless had their own contacts (and presidential golf outing) with Mr. Lay. We already know, thanks to a 1997 article in Time, that Bill Clinton nudged Mack McLarty to lend the administration's weight to an Enron bid on a $3 billion power-plant project in India, and that the Democrats received $100,000 from Enron just four days before the Indian government came through. Will Joe Lieberman, who (like two-thirds of his committee) took Enron money, revisit his own party's Enron history as well as that of the G.O.P.? According to a 1995 report in The Nation, Robert Rubin's association with Enron didn't start last year at Citigroup but dates back to his pre-Treasury career at Goldman, Sachs. Enron's Washington office is currently headed by another former Clinton Treasury appointee.  Then again, who in either party hasn't cashed an Enron check? No fewer than 71 senators and 188 congressmen have been on the Enron gravy train. All but 5 of the 56 members of another investigative committee, House Energy and Commerce, got Enron or Arthur Andersen dough. The country's chief law enforcement officer, John Ashcroft, has recused himself from the case because he too received Enron cash  though even that ethical gesture looks suspicious, given his failure to stay out of Justice matters involving such other contributors as the N.R.A. and Microsoft. Another Congressional investigator, Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, was the single biggest House recipient of Arthur Andersen campaign money. Phil Gramm, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, and his wife, Wendy (a former federal regulator now on Enron's board), could pass for one of Enron's wholly owned Cayman Island subsidiaries.  Harvey Pitt, the Bush administration's chief at the S.E.C., was actually an Arthur Andersen lawyer. After this week's revelation that top Andersen executives knew of funny business at Enron as early as February 2001, you have to wonder whether Mr. Pitt should be a witness in an S.E.C. investigation rather than its overlord. Was he representing Andersen at the time it first detected Enron's misbehavior? Was he in the loop? The stonewalling may have already begun, since neither the S.E.C. nor Andersen, when queried late this week, could say just when Mr. Pitt was in the accounting firm's employ.  Whom can the country turn to for an honest investigation? Democrats and Republicans alike are so beholden to accounting-industry money that they scuttled an attempt by Arthur Levitt, the former S.E.C. head, to regulate conflicts of interest in companies like Andersen two years ago. "If ever there was a case for a special counsel, this is it," says Governor Richards, but that idea certainly has no takers in Mr. Ashcroft's Justice Department or among grandstanding Democrats. "We haven't come anywhere close to that point yet," said Mr. Lieberman, never one to surrender a spotlight without a struggle.  A top aide to Henry Waxman, another Democratic inquisitor, has called the Enron scandal "the perfect storm," and a storm this perfect is certain to muddy Democrats as well. Enron has arisen like the ghost of over-the-top Christmases past, as a jolting throwback to the untethered America of the dot-com bubble. The greed of its perpetrators, and of the enabling politicians of both parties who took their cut before the wipeout, looks even uglier against the stark backdrop of those less well- connected Americans who are fighting our war.  ------------------------ "In little more than a year we have gone from enjoying peace and the most

Armed With Handhelds
* Using technology from Aether, state troopers at Logan Airport have
gained wireless access to the National Crime Information Center.
By Jennifer Maselli
Jan. 17, 2002
Massachusetts state troopers working at Boston's Logan Airport now have
wireless access to the National Crime Information Center thanks to
technology from Aether that delivers data to BlackBerry handheld devices.
Eighty troopers working at Logan are using the BlackBerrys to quickly send
information gathered from license plates or by talking to individuals at the
airport to the National Crime Information Center to check for stolen
vehicles, outstanding warrants, or previous felonies. When an inquiry is
made via the handheld, the data is sent through a wireless network to a
server at the Lake County, Fla., sheriff's office. Once data is received,
it's transmitted back to the device. Massachusetts is in the process of
upgrading its interfaces with the National Crime Information Center. Once
completed, it will use its own servers instead of the one in Florida.
This will let the troopers conduct more checks in less time, says a
spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Port Authority. Prior to using the
devices, troopers had to radio or telephone inquiries and then wait for a
response. The pilot program will continue for the next month or two. The
Port Authority then will decide whether to continue using the devices.

Reply-To: snetnews

As my friend said, "It's too late to work within the system and just about time to start shooting the unconstitutional bastards."
JUST SAY NO TO SEARCHES!
 | By Pat Barber
A chief deputy sheriff told me, "We rely on people's ignorance to get their consent." Most folks don't know they have a constitutional right to refuse a police search request...and a lot of others are afraid to say no.
For the past year, police agencies across Texas have stepped up what they call "consent" searches of vehicles on our highways. The unprecedented numbers of searches are mainly the push of the state's 47 federally funded Drug Task Force(s) with a major assist from the Texas Highway Patrol and local officers. An officer will stop a traveler on some pretext such as a seat belt or speeding violation, or as has been documented in many cases -- no valid reason at all, get the driver out of the vehicle, ask, "Do you have any guns or drugs in your car?" And when the traveler answers in the negative, the officer says, "Then you don't mind if I look in the trunk, do you?" The officer is standing there in his mirrored sunshades, black Task Force uniform, pistol on his hip, and the traveler has nothing but a limp ego. (read Sheeple)
Most people feel intimidated by this kind of pressure. They don't know their rights, believe they will be searched even if they do refuse, and give up. Police officers are not required by law to inform the traveler that he or she has an absolute constitutional right to refuse a search request, that a refusal cannot be used in any way to imply probable cause of criminal activity or that they will be free to leave if they do A chief deputy sheriff told me, "We rely on people's ignorance to get their consent." An old DPS trooper friend tells his family and friends to say to these black-shirted and black-booted "storm troopers" (task force officers) the following: "Officer, I don't have anything to hide, but I don't want you pawing through my stuff." Sometimes a refusal will bring threats to get a warrant or a drug dog, but if the officer really had probable cause to search, he wouldn't be "asking" for a search; he would be "telling" you.
However, my data indicates that a firm and consistent "no" will work most of the time, regardless of their threats. An officer stopped my daughter for speeding and wanted to search her pickup, although there was no evidence she was carrying contraband. She told him she was late to meet her vet -- that was why she was speeding and that she didn't have time for a search. The officer threatened to go to the JP for a warrant.
When she heard the magic word "warrant", she thought she didn't have any choice. What she said was, "Officer, my father is a lawyer, and he told me that if I ever gave consent for a search, he would kick my butt. I'm sorry; I can't do it." The officer angrily said, "Take your ticket and get out of here." Her quick answer saved her a lot of unnecessary humiliation, and is recommended for three reasons:
1. Her response was funny (although the officer obviously didn't have a sense of humor)
2. It was evident she had access to legal counsel
3. The officer knew she was acting on advice of counsel.
I have had many complaints from average citizens who are upset about the new highway search terrorism. One well dressed lady traveling in a late model suburban was seen standing by the side of the road trying to hold her hair together in a 20 mph wind while officers threw her possessions on the ground. After the officers finished the "consent" search and left, a local citizen stopped and helped her pick up her things. I've seen vacationing families with children standing in the summer heat in the bar ditch while officers went through their suitcases. I saw two gray-haired ladies standing in the cold, last winter. I've had hundreds of complaints from citizens who felt like they had been mistreated for no reason. I may be old-fashioned, but this kind of dangerous and ineffective police behavior is offensive to me, and I would expect, to most Texans.
The "shotgun" search approach may occasionally net smugglers, but at what price? Most folks don't want to see us turn into a third-world police state where you can't walk across the street without a police dog's nose in your crotch. My main goal is to create a fundamental debate about roadside searches. Do they yield enough criminal cases to justify intrusions into glove compartments, trunks and luggage of law-abiding travelers?
While the police agencies are quick to seek publicity for their busts, data about "failed" (nothing found) searches is suppressed. No police paper trail is kept. If we ever got an accurate assessment of what they are doing, we would likely see an enormous number of citizens are being terrorized and harassed by an ineffective policy. They can't stop the flow of drugs. How far do we allow them to erode our constitutional liberties in an unwinnable war on drugs? Tell your clients to Just Say NO to Searches!

Arafat in Israels public relations trap
By Abdul Rahman Al-Rashid
Was it not a false and ill-advised step on the part of the Palestinian
Authority (PA) to deny outright that it had links with the ship whose cargo
of weapons was seized recently by Israel?
Israels public relations machinery has converted the incident into a big
propaganda weapon. Though most Arab writers rallied round the Palestinian
Authority and emphasized its lack of involvement in the arms shipment,
Israel, on the other hand, is bent on using the matter against the
The mistake on the part of the PA was not that it bought the weapons and
made an attempt to bring them to the Palestinian homeland. On the other
hand, its hurried denial was a gross mistake. The denial made the PA fall
into the trap laid by Israels public relations officials who wanted to
capitalize on denial by PA officials rather than the actual capture of the
The Israelis were desperately seeking an opportunity to establish that the
Palestinians, including their chief, were a bunch of liars. Soon after the
capture of the ship, the Israelis announced the seizure of a lesser quantity
than what was actually seized. This was apparently a calculated move on the
part of Israel which was sure that the PA would deny. The next Israeli move
was to reveal the full details of the seized weapons while the Palestinians
held fast to their denial. The evidence produced by Israel was strong enough
to pose serious challenges to the Palestinian Authoritys credibility.
The issue would not have become so complicated if the PA had not attached so
much importance to the seizure of the ship. Arafat should have handled the
issue as the former American President Bill Clinton did regarding his
involvement with Monica Levinsky. While admitting that he had some kind of
relationship with the girl, Clinton denied having had illicit relations with
her. Thus he brought half the issue under control. He did not deny all the
charges but neither did he tell the whole truth.
Instead of making a total and complete denial, it would have been safer for
Arafat to have said that he was awaiting a full report on the issue. After a
week or month, he could have clung to the denial if he were sure that his
position was secure. The other option open to the Palestinian leadership was
to announce that the weapons belonged to the PA but that the ship was in
international waters and had not entered Palestinian waters when it was
seized. Or the leaders could have said the ship was being sent to some other
place where the Palestinian police were being trained.
The Israelis exhibited the captain of the ship, an official of the PA, who
admitted his role in importing the weapons. His statements were extremely
embarrassing to the PA leadership. Thus, the Israelis got a golden
opportunity to show that the Palestinian leadership was lying. Nobody can
deny the Palestinians their right to defend themselves. There are several
methods to establish that right, however, instead of resorting to outright
lies. In the worst-case scenario, and if the half-truth failed to produce
the desired effect, the whole truth could be told.
It would have been much better if Arafat had stated that the shipment
belonged to him and that he was forced to import the weapons in the face of
the Israeli challenges and moves which aim at destroying his authority in
the region. If he had made such a statement, Israel would not have been able
to make use of the situation so powerfully against him.

Israel blows up, but fails to stifle the Voice of Palestine
By Nazir Majally, Arab News Staff
RAMALLAH, West Bank, 20 January  Israeli troops blew up the Voice of
Palestine radio station office here yesterday, but failed to stop it from
broadcasting. Palestinian officials called for international sanctions
against Israel
Part of the five-story Voice of Palestine building in the West Bank city of
Ramallah collapsed after Israeli troops, accompanied by tanks and
bulldozers, cleared people from the area before dawn and detonated
The blast sent flames, smoke and a shower of debris skyward, and Palestinian
officials said the force shattered windows in nearby houses. They accused
Israel of trying to undermine the Palestinian Authority and its
institutions. The army said in a statement it had carried out the operation
in retaliation for the "murderous attack" in the northern Israeli city of
Hadera two days earlier.
Israel has accused the Voice of Palestine, which broadcasts the official
positions of the Palestinian Authority, of transmitting provocative material
during the Palestinian uprising which erupted in September 2000.
Palestinians deny the charge and say Israel is trying to silence its media.
Voice of Palestine Director Bassem Abusumaya said the station had resumed
broadcasting news, songs and talk shows on FM frequencies used by private
radio stations. Palestinian television continued broadcasting out of Gaza.
The Palestinian leadership said in a statement the "cheap crime" perpetrated
by Israel was meant "to silence the Palestinian voice so the world wont
know about the brutal crime the Israeli occupation has carried out against
our people". It called on the United Nations and rights groups to condemn
Israels action.
"The Palestinian Authority asks that the international community impose
sanctions against Israel so that it stops its aggression and crimes against
the Palestinian people," Nabil Abu Rudeineh, an adviser to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, said.

Media missed the story in Afghanistan
By Jonathan Power, Special to Arab News
LONDON, 20 January  The media has paid for its mistake of believing in
George W. Bushs war against the Taleban. At the end of the day it is pretty
clear that in the supposed objective of the war, the hunting down of Osama
Bin Laden, the trail has gone cold. The scorecard of deaths reveals that not
only have more civilian Afghans died than Americans in the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon, but the number of journalists killed in action was
eight times the total of American soldiers.
Yet by and large, the Western media have swallowed the White House hype
wholesale. Not only was it generally considered a just and necessary war,
they devoted all their considerable resources and more, even to the point
of financial exhaustion and the exploitation of the very lives of their
reporters  to covering it in excruciating detail. War, sure enough,
provides the journalistic rush of adrenalin that keeps old editors young and
persuades young journalists that this is the way to make their careers.
Too many of them overlook the wise words of one of the greatest journalists
of them all, Walter Lippmann, who observed, "News and truth are not the same
thing. The function of news is to signalize an event. The function of truth
is to bring to light the hidden facts."
Of course, the best papers published the voice of the occasional dissident.
The conservative paper in Spain, El Mundo, has been surprisingly open to
anti-war contributors, and columnists Simon Jenkins of the London Times and
William Pfaff of the International Herald Tribune (but who inside America?)
have been among the strongest voices of dissent. But set against the
outpourings of the news pages, the television coverage and the backbone of
the editorial comment, these have been solitary voices crying in the
They didnt get it all right by any means. They underestimated the
effectiveness of modern-day American air power and they overstated the
malaise in the Islamic world  there was no popular uprising in favor of the
fundamentalist extremists. But on the essentials they were right  Bin Laden
and his henchmen would not be laid low by this kind of war, Afghanistans
political structure would remain precarious, and America would not change
its spots and overnight become a progressive force for international
cooperation, the supporter of a reinvigorated UN, the imposer of a
settlement between Israel and Palestine and the country that would no longer
walk away from the growing and disturbing problem of failed states.
It is these issues that should have been the focus of the press coverage
from the start, not the mock-heroics of aircraft carriers, Special Forces
and the stunt work of the young pilots in the sky. Yet the Western press was
easily intimidated by the near unanimity of the political class into going
along with the essentials of the war. The BBC early on even apologized for
letting a studio debate run away with itself and become too critical of
The problem of terrorism remains. I have little doubt that although America
will remain the prime target, Europe, in particular my home country,
Britain, will be a target too. There is, however, no way that this type of
terrorism can be fought either by conventional war or by the construction of
a defensive missile shield. Indeed, if America now extends the war to
Somalia, the Sudan, Yemen and Indonesia, as is the talk, it will end up
bogged down, counterproductive and, most dangerous of all for the rest of
us, profoundly angry, the condition of those who back themselves into
hopeless quagmires.
The hard answers dont go away. We are back to where we were 1993 when the
World Trade Center was first attacked. We need good police work to track
down these terrorists. Then when they are found  as Bin Laden was in 1996
in Sudan  we need governments which are ready (which the Clinton
administration was not) to send him and his likes for trial in a US civilian
courtroom or, better still, in the International Criminal Court.
Beyond that we need the West together with the rest of the world to grapple
with the problems that breed terrorism  lack of political progress in the
Middle East, first and foremost, and the continued tolerance for deep
poverty and growing income inequality in many parts of the Third World. As
The Economist has just reported, for $25 per rich-country citizen invested
in low-cost health services in the poorest parts of the world, a colossal
number of lives could be saved and immeasurable suffering relieved. Now that
would be a start.
And that would not only be a good story, but one to stay with.

@_subject: [ISN] Criminal Charges Settled In Distributed-Computing Case  (fwd) 
By Steven Bonisteel, Newsbytes
DECATUR, GEORGIA, U.S.A.,
17 Jan 2002, 5:05 PM CST
A computer technician at Georgia-run college who found himself facing
criminal charges after installing software for a volunteer
distributed-computing effort will face probation instead of prison.
David McOwen, once a systems administrator at DeKalb Technical
College, faces a year of probation and a $2,100 fine for connecting a
number of DeKalb computers to Distributed.net so that the spare
computing cycles could assist in a communal code-breaking challenge.
But McOwen's supporters, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation
(EFF), said today that an agreement reached with state prosecutors was
far better than the worst-case scenario: years in prison and hundreds
of thousands of dollars in fines and restitution.
"David never should have been prosecuted in the first place, but we're
glad that the state decided to stop," said Lee Tien, a senior staff
attorney at the EFF. "He very likely could have won if the case had
gone to trial, but trials cost money and you never know what will
Tien said McOwen, who was to face a criminal trial later this month,
will also have to perform 80 hours of community service "unrelated to
computers or technology." However McOwen will not end up with a felony
or misdemeanor record under Georgia's First Offender Act.
The criminal charges stunned many participants in
distributed-computing efforts, who frequently are also denizens of
university or college computing departments.
In early January 2000, when the San Diego Supercomputer Center of the
University of California was issuing press releases about its
number-crunching prowess via Distributed.net in an RC5-64
code-breaking challenge, DeKalb was suspending McOwen for
participating in the same event.
A suspension wasn't all McOwen faced. This spring, long after he had
resigned from DeKalb in the wake of the suspension, McOwen learned
that he was being investigated by the state attorney general's office
as a result of his Distributed.net participation. This fall, he was
officially charged one count of computer theft and seven counts of
computer trespassing.
Tien in a prepared statement said that the dispute centered on a on
whether McOwen had fair notice that the distributed-computing software
was prohibited at DeKalb.
"From what I can tell, the state would have had a hard time proving
beyond a reasonable doubt that David knew he wasn't authorized to
install the software," Tien said. "I can't help but feel that this was
a face-saving deal for the state."
Originally, the state had calculated that McOwen had drained hundreds
of thousands of dollars worth of DeKalb computing time since
installing the software early in 1999, arriving at its figure by
calculating that the software sapped 59 cents worth of bandwidth each

---------- Forwarded message ----------
And so, the "only fix it if people find out about it" mentality of the software industry
FINALLY begins to reap bad fruit, after decades of neglect.
A panel of experts assembled by the National Academy of Sciences has
recommended that the special exemptions from product liability lawsuits
given to software makers should be taken away.  Rep. Rick Boucher (D-VA),
in particular, is quoted as saying:
"The producers of software should be responsible for any flaws that the
software contains."
As much as everyone would like to see Microsoft sued into the ground, it
ain't gonna happen.  A much more likely scenario is that smaller companies
and producers of Open Source will quickly find themselves at the end of a
sharp lawsuit -- clearing the way for companies who can afford to pay out
lawsuits to continue as they are. Oh, the irony.
Additionally, Bruce Scheiner has some interesting comments to make about
Microsoft's attitude towards security, and how censoring bug information
hurts far more than it helps.

ACTION ALERT:
ABC Omits U.S. From Human Rights Report
January 18, 2002
On its January 16 broadcast, ABC's World News Tonight aired this brief item
about the annual report released that day by Human Rights Watch:
"The international human rights group Human Rights Watch has released its
annual report, and it says that several countries are using the U.S.-led war
against terrorism as a justification to ignore human rights. Human Rights
Watch says that Russia, Egypt, Israel, China, Zimbabwe, Malaysia and
Uzbekistan have all cracked down on domestic opponents in the name of
That summary is close to what the group's press release stated (1/16/02):
"The anti-terror campaign led by the United States is inspiring
opportunistic attacks on civil liberties around the world, Human Rights
Watch warned in its annual global survey released today."
But one country singled out for criticism by Human Rights Watch was
conspicuously absent from ABC's report: the United States, whose
anti-terrorism measures were described in the group's press release as
"threatening long-held human rights principles."
Among Bush administration actions that were identified as demonstrating a
"troubling disregard for well-established human rights safeguards" were "new
laws permitting the indefinite detention of non-citizens, special military
commissions to try suspected terrorists, the detention of over 1,000 people,
and the abrogation of the confidentiality of attorney-client communications
for certain detainees."
While ABC ignored this criticism of the U.S. in favor of pointing fingers at
other countries, the rights report actually drew a connection between the
erosion of human rights standards in the U.S. and overseas. As the London
Guardian reported (1/17/02), "dictators 'need do nothing more than
photocopy' measures introduced by the Bush administration, whose ability to
criticise abuses in other countries was thus deeply compromised, said the

Insider trading, US style... Heh heh heh. Seems like everything Bush ever did, was
either for the poll ratings or money. The selfish logic is infallible. It's all either for his political gain or hard cash
for his pals.
Well, Americans certainly got the president
they deserve, even if they didn't elect the
guy. Money buys it all.

'It Would Help Enron If You Made That Call' Bush Was Told
By Ed Vulliamy The Observer - London As he approaches the first anniversary of his inauguration, George W Bush is under siege. He has won the war in Afghanistan, but finds himself engaged in a new battle against a scandal that is threatening to dog his administration and tarnish his reputation . Bush and his administration have been revealed as entwined in a story of corporate greed and political manipulation by an energy firm called Enron, now under double criminal investigation. The scandal - in which the life savings and retirement funds of tens of thousands of employees vanished while a number of executive directors lined their pockets - reaches so high that John Ashcroft, the Attorney-General, has had to withdraw from the investigation because he received Enron money, and lawsuits are the pipeline to force Vice-President Dick Cheney for details of his contacts with the company. The day Bush took office - a year ago next Saturday - was as cold and comfortless as his victory; his motorcade braved driving rain and a gauntlet of demonstrations marking the most contested and ugliest election result in US history. After 11 September, the world changed and so did America's view of Bush. He became the only President since Franklin Roosevelt to maintain the support of over 80 per cent of Americans for weeks on end. But now the White House is laid bare by what rivals call 'Enronomics' - the political fable of the Enron corporation. It has long been reported how the Bush administration and family is beholden to the energy industry. Before the Afghan war, an 'Energy Task Force' favourable to the industry was the main concern for Cheney, who himself came to office from the biggest oil equipment firm in the world. Enron was just the kind of scandal a war would hide. The company plunged from a stock rating worth $60 billion - seventh on the Fortune list of US companies - into the biggest bankruptcy filing in US history, registered on 2 December. The ethical - maybe criminal - core of the scandal is that Enron trapped its employees into a 'stock-lock', whereby they were not allowed to sell share options bought by way of savings. When the company collapsed, they lost everything. Meanwhile, Enron's executives - blessed by inside information and foresight - made a killing by scrambling to sell shares before the price collapsed. The victims of Enron's rise and fall were regular employees who opted to join a savings plan by investing in their employer - and why not? With soaring energy prices and giddy profits, the share value quadrupled between 1997 and January last year. The catch was they were not allowed to sell. They were people like Pat Betteridge, of the subsidiary Portland General Electric company in Oregon, who remembers grand claims by Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay on a visit north: 'We like to think of ourselves,' he bragged, 'as the Microsoft of the energy world.' Betteridge used his $300,000 retirement savings to buy 3,500 shares - now worth not a cent. 'If I was hired to do electrical work and I botched it as bad as them,' he says, 'I'd either be doing time or get my licence yanked.' The beneficiaries of the company's surge to power were those who boarded the wheel of perpetual motion that binds the Bush administration to the energy industry. Then the company's brass even tried to make their fortune out of its fall as well. The Observer has dug into Enron's past to find that intimate connections with Bush and his Texan Republicans started long before the campaigns that brought them to Washington Enron is a Houston-based utility trading company that sells energy to consumers, industrial and domestic. It is one of the biggest of its kind in the world - a standing it owes in no small part to Bush's governorship in Texas. Texas's 1992 Energy Policy Act opened a regulatory black hole into which Enron moved and thrived, forcing established utility companies to buy energy from it. Meanwhile, in Washington, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, under the presidency of Bush's father, allowed for an exemption in trading energy subsidiaries. The practice would be Enron's downfall. The 1992 trading commission was chaired by Wendy Gramm, wife of Texas Senator Phil Gramm, close friend of the Bush family and recipient of $97,350 in political donations from Enron. Once the exemption was accomplished, Mrs Gramm resigned to join the Enron board. As a member of its current audit committee, she is expected to play a key role in the forthcoming lawsuits and criminal investigation into bankruptcy and document destruction. In 1997, Enron was anxious to break into Pennsylvania, one of America's biggest energy markets, with its huge consumers in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The company was having difficulty, and Lay asked Bush (who liked to call him 'Kenny boy') to help. Bush duly called the then state governor, Tom Ridge, to pitch for Enron, whose bid duly succeeded. 'I called George W to kind of tell him what was going on,' said Lay at the time, 'and I said it would be very helpful to Enron if he could just call the governor and tell him Enron is a serious company'. Ridge was made Secretary of Homeland Security - Bush's new White House office - after 11 September. Lay and Enron have been bountiful contributors to George Bush Jnr. Since 1993, company executives have donated nearly $2 million to him personally. Lay also donated $326,000 in soft money to the Republican Party over the three years prior to Bush's presidential bid and his wife added $100,000 for the inauguration festivities. The administration is splattered with senior officials owning stock in Enron. Economic adviser Larry Lindsay and Trade Representative Robert Zoellick went straight from Enron's payroll into office. The biggest holding is that of Army Secretary Thomas White, who as a former Enron executive holds stock and options totalling $50m to $100m. Rove himself holds as much as $250,000 in stock, and other holders include Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, his assistant William Winkenwerder, Assistant Treasury Secretary Mark Weinberger, Economic Undersecretary Kathleen Cooper, Education Undersecretary Eugene Hickock, the ambassadors to Russia, Ireland, the Emirates and officials in the energy department, including its chief financial officer Bruce Carnes. It is not known which - if any - of these privileged stockholders sold their shares along with the Enron bosses, or suffered the same loss as everyone else. Such details will appear when they make this year's filings - leaving any that did so open to ethical, if not criminal, inquiry. Bush has pursued the aggressive deregulation policies preferred by Enron and its kind, including legislation that exempts key elements of Enron's energy business from oversight by the federal government - pushed by none other than Senator Phil Gramm. Lay's hand can meanwhile be found behind such episodes as the sudden replacement of Curtis Hebert as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Texan Pat Wood, a friend of Lay. According to one source, the sacking after only weeks in the job came after 'an unsettling telephone conversation with Kenneth Lay' in which he was 'prodded to back a faster pace in opening up access to the electricity transmission grid'. For all its troubles, Enron continued to benefit from Bush policies - markedly a refusal to step in and help California during the energy crisis last year, leaving consumers to pay the price... to Enron. Enron was so close to the bosom of the administration that Lay and other executives were called to the White House for six meetings with Cheney and his staff - the last one only a week before the company made the staggering announcement that it was slashing shareholder equity by $1.2bn. For Enron was playing a double game. In the run-up to the announcement, its president, Greg Whalley, was frantically lobbying another wing of the administration for help in arranging loans. His point man was Undersecretary Peter Fisher. Lay discussed the upcoming bankruptcy twice with Commerce Secretary Don Evans - one of the Texan 'Iron Triangle' that propelled Bush to power. Later, he also twice pleaded Enron's case to Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill. But the Republicans were not the only political heavyweights to benefit from Enron's greed. The company has made donations to many Democrats too - some 27 per cent of its political contributions, according to the Centre for Responsive Politics in Washington. And among Enron's top point men in Washington during the bankruptcy saga was Clinton's former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who was revealed by the Washington Post yesterday as having made a representation last November to the current Treasury on behalf of the company. Rubin is now chairman of the executive committee of the Citigroup bank, one of Enron's principal backers, trying, with the JP Morgan bank, to raise $1.5bn in an effort to see the company through the bankruptcy crisis. These are matters for the six Congressional committees preparing to investigate Enron. But they will have to wait for the two criminal investigations launched this week: one into Enron's bankruptcy, the other into the admission by the company's auditor, Arthur Andersen, that it destroyed thousands of documents about the bankruptcy. Andersen had good reason to destroy the papers. The reasons for Enron's destruction when all the winds seemed to blow behind the company's fortunes are associated with the labyrinth of subsidiaries built up by Chief Finance Officer Andrew Fastow, fired on 24 October, and other executives. Fastow created partnerships with what were described as outside, independently-run companies with names such as 'Chewco' or 'Jedi' - after characters in Star Wars - that were owned by him or others with Enron backing. As a result, hundreds of millions of dollars were slushing overseas to tax havens as Fastow and other executives - so they said - sought to shore up the company against a possible fall in energy prices. What they were allegedly doing was amassing personal fortunes. The ensuing gaps in the balance sheet became a gaping abyss which could not be hidden and down which the company finally fell. Enron admitted that it had overstated profits by $400m in reports issued since. However, Chewco alone enabled Enron to be able to keep some $600m of debt off its books. The crucial criminal issue is whether executives misled investors by inflating revenues and minimising debts. The political issue is how closely entwined is the Washington elite - and the immediate circle around Bush. Seven months of Bush's oil-friendly presidency was driven out of the spotlight by 11 September. It had pleased the industry for its isolationism and determination to withdraw from world affairs - the Kyoto Accords on global warming or arms reduction with Russia. Domestically, Bush's cause was an articulate one: a tax cut worth $1.3 trillion, of which nine-tenths went to the 1 per cent of wealthiest Americans, and ambitions to drill for oil across the Alaskan wilderness and deregulate controls over the oil and energy industries. By the afternoon of 11 September, Bush had become the vanishing president during his people's hour of need, cowering underground beneath an Air Force base in remote Nebraska. But by the end of that week, Americans saw in Bush not a spoiled brat, but the man they wanted to lead the nation to war. Now the Enron scandal brings the presidency home, with Bush as Winston Churchill preparing for the 1945 election in Britain. The would-be Clement Attlee is Tom Daschle, leader of the Senate Democrats, who last week left the unity of war behind to unleash his congressional campaign for November 2002 with an offensive over welfare, tax policy, health care, energy and the environment. The elections are critical to Bush and the Republicans: no US president apart from Nixon and Reagan has not lost ground at the mid-
term polls, and the Democrats, even without making substantial gains, can keep control of the Senate while taking over the House and state governorships. For the State of the Union address Bush will give on the twenty- ninth of this month, White House staff are scrambling to entwine the war in Afghanistan with the continuing domestic agenda. But the minefield they must cross is named Enron.   If you are interested in a free subscription to The

01-07-02: A Voice from Abroad: Give greed a chance
By Linda Deak
January 7, 2002 -- The 47 percent of the country who voted for Bush wanted some or all of the things that Republicans support: all stops pulled out to give greedy money-making free rein; less governmental controls; smaller government; reduced taxes, more and "better" religion in government; more baseball and less policy, a simpler America, by America and for America.
His supporters were attracted by his down home simplicity, his black/white, evil/good thinking. The steam rolling that had Bush declared the president was fueled by money, a lot of it oil money. The press and the polls were loyally Republican and they did their part. It did not matter that the greed candidate had a pitifully stocked brain and we had entered the Information Age. It did not matter that he was clueless about the outside world as the globe spun towards a one-world vision. It was about money and the belief that money was what mattered most in America. It was about not being fancy, not being complicated.
Let's make an assessment of the bomb damage in our country and I do not mean the plane bombs. I mean the damage the Supreme Court inflicted on us by not allowing us to have the winner of our election lead our country. It has occurred to me at several junctures since Election 2000 that perhaps the angst that many of us feel is a waste of energy. There is an enormous backfire building; the ironies are beautiful. Everyone in the world knows that Bush and friends brought shame to our nation and that democracy in our country is in serious jeopardy. His presidency is not a win for America. It is not a win for Republicans and it is not a win for the corporations that fought with vigor and paid handsomely to give greed a chance by having their
corporate puppet appointed.
Here is an irony: corporations are all looking pretty nasty right now. Enron, the leader of the pack, has shamed the oil industry and is taking others down through association. There is going to be so much sunshine put on their avarice and shenanigans that it will take decades for that industry to recover, if ever. In spite of Bush never suggesting such a thing, "alternate methods" are back in vogue. Perhaps it is the beginning of the end for the oil industry.
Then there is the wonderful backfire to the Christian Coalition. Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell made themselves infamous in the days after the attack. It has been distressing to watch these fellows take religion and reduce it to a very base and low level, insisting on their brand of religion being wedged into our government. Now they have even had to settle a disgraceful racial discrimination lawsuit. Whose religion is this?
There is the matter of the economy. Look at the graphs. Ever since Bush's appointment there has been a steady decline. We are now deep into the recession and even though Republicans paid fortunes to place him in office, it is costing them their shirts because he is staying in office. They are not going to get their corporate welfare checks after all. The greed again is not attractive.
Bush makes American business and our country look like sharp-elbowed, completely selfish people. We are not citizens of the world; we are vultures of the world. The Bush policy is: what is good for America is all that matters and business is what we care about, not the environment. Nice folks we are.
Do you know about Lynn Cheney's ACTA group that puts academics on lists for not being patriotic enough, being too intellectual, asking the wrong questions? You got to love that hypocrisy. The people who stole the election, made a sham of American democracy, now decide who is patriotic and who is not. I lodge this complaint wrapped in an old fashioned flag, the Betsy Ross flag, the one that flew when our forefathers carved out America, not the cheap imitations being fashioned and flown now. I would be proud to be on Lynn Cheney's list. My descendents would be able to claim to be Daughters and Sons of Lynne Cheney's ACTA List. (ACTA stands for American Council of Trustees and Alumni and her report can be found on the Internet at goacta.org).
The corporatized media have betrayed their integrity and their profession. They have betrayed their readership, the thinkers, who are their customers. This independent press, which is publishing this article, is going to flourish as a result, maybe even usurp the big guys. In spite of threats, our freedom of speech is deep inside us; it lies on the double helix in the American DNA. Ashcroft cannot wrest that out of us, no matter how many bibles and guns he flashes at us, his Draculas, the American Terrorist Truth Sayers.
Bush and his minions tell us that the American lifestyle is the envy of the world. That is simply not true.
Because corporate media decide what we should and should not know and the choices they make are based on what is best for their corporations, we are served a dismally shallow coverage of the news and world events. Our news comes in two flavors, vanilla or sensationally spicy. The world is richly diverse, not black and white, vanilla or always sensational. Too many Americans are not aware of that, perhaps even afraid of the outside world and that is a shame. Many in the outside world think Americans are dumb and Bush is not exactly an ambassador for brilliance. Jerry Springer and Jenny Jones do America no service by showcasing the pathology that seems to abound in our culture. The screaming idiocy does not foster jealousy, even though this practice seems to make a lot of Americans wealthy. Money beats knowledge and information on our American corporate list of priorities.
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Scalia insisted on the votes not being counted in Florida with his statement "the counting of votesthreatens irreparable harm to petitioner [Bush], and to the country by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election." Obviously, Scalia wanted Bush to be president whether he won the election or not. Now look how big Scalia's cloud has become. It not only covers Bush. It covers our whole country. It covers the Supreme Court. It is a cloud full of foreboding and it will not go away. The Democratic Senate is right to scrutinize each judge nominated by Bush very carefully. Look what careless appointments did to our democracy.
Our attorney general is an embarrassment to justice. The people destroying our freedoms (except for the gun rights as outlined by the National Rifle Association) insist our judicial system is the envy of the world. This is laughable. I can hardly wait for the world courts to chime in on the issue of the American Bush-appointed military tribunals.
Bush wants to be in Crawford. He looks miserable deplaning anywhere outside of America. It was an astonishing irony when he had to call on Pakistan's General Pervez Musharraf, also a self-appointed leader, whom he could not name during the campaign, to form a fierce partnership. Bush does not have the savvy, the curiosity, and the knowledge of the outside world necessary to garner global support. Terrorism can rally support, but not Bush. Bush is not a popular man in the world. "Howdja like that game last night?" does not work on the global stage. Even skewed Republican-financed polls prove this.
Then there is our growing government. A huge irony was made clear during the anthrax terrorist attack. The people who derided government and lamented its very being and did not understand that Social Security is a federal program and wanted it privatized anyway, did not know Public Health from the Centers for Disease Control. Bush has added more layers of government. Watch it grow. Watch the surplus decline. We cannot really expect a man who failed in business, but was successful as a baseball team owner, thanks to government payouts, to be a shrewd and capable CEO of the American government.
People are very complex and all of us share humanity. The Republicans I know who are not dripping with greed or radiating stupidity or both are having a very hard time making eye contact with others. I watch them. The shame is deep. Bush put it there. He has no compunction about seizing power without winning. He has no problem with thumbing his nose at the outside world, tearing up treaties, scoffing at history, and parading our greed as the greatest part of America.
Well, guess what, Mr. Bush? Your parade is going to get rained on. Greed is not a winner. It never has been and never will be. The 53 percent of us who did not vote for you don't have to do a thing. We can just sit by and watch.

Securing American Airlines - Free Drugs For All
Thu Jan 17 2002
by Bob Millerton
Drug Users Anonymous USA spokesperson suggested on Wednesday that all
passengers on American Airlines should be drugged and chained, or at the least provided with free narcotics to sedate themselves with. This
in turn would provide the absolute security required by the United States
citizens to resume their flights.
The spokesperson denied to identify herself, but she was adamant in
demanding equal treatment from American Airlines to all of its customers,
equal to those provided by the Taliban military. 'All the cursomers should
be equally sedated during the flights to improved the flight security.'
She said. 'It is absolutely pura racism, and nothing more, that only Arabs
and especially Taleban should be given drugs during their flights.'
American Airlines spokesperson Mike Smith commented that this might
improve the airline popularity, and that they could probably cut a deal
with the CIA for taking up some of the drugs importing business from them,
or at the least have CIA provide the drugs.
The CIA press contacts didn't offer any comments in time for this story.

Reply-To: ParanoidTimes
Spying on America   Charles R. Smith
  Wednesday, Jan. 16, 2002 FBI Investigates Foreign Spy Ring - U.S. Companies Deny Involvement
In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the FBI reportedly stumbled on an espionage ring that had penetrated the wiretapping system of U.S. law enforcement. Fox News Channel reported that the FBI was holding nearly 100 Israeli citizens with direct ties to foreign military, criminal and intelligence services. In a follow-up to these reports, the FBI did not deny that such actions had been taken. However, FBI spokesman Paul Bresson would not answer specific questions on the reported espionage. "We have seen the Fox News segments that aired several weeks ago on this topic and found some inaccuracies with it. Because they are sensitive issues, I do not have the luxury of discussing what precisely was accurate and what was inaccurate about their reporting," stated Paul Bresson, spokesman for the FBI. "Most of the questions [asked by NewsMax.com] are not directly answerable by CALEA [Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]. Your questions may be more properly addressed to our National Security Division, which I know would never discuss this with you, unfortunately," stated Bresson. Employees of U.S. Companies Reportedly Involved The espionage operation reportedly includes employees of two companies that perform official wiretaps for U.S. local, state and federal law enforcement: Comverse Infosys and Amdocs. Official spokesman for both companies denied any involvement in the alleged espionage ring. "Amdocs is unaware of any investigation or allegations and has not been contacted by any agency," stated Dan Ginsberg, of the PR firm Porter Novelli, for Amdocs. "Amdocs has not been involved in any illegal or improper activity," said Ginsberg flatly. "We know of absolutely no factual basis for suggestions that intelligence agencies or others have misused our products for illicit purposes," stated Paul Baker, spokesman for Comverse. "In particular, no company employees have been involved in any of the incidents referred to in your December 19 story. Moreover, the reference in that story to a suspected abuse of our equipment in a foiled Los Angeles drug bust was completely erroneous. Our equipment was not involved in any such incident," said Baker. "Comverse Technology is a New York-based corporation that has been publicly traded for 15 years. It is an S&P 500 and a NASDAQ-100 Index company that has won a worldwide leadership position in telecommunications," noted Baker. "More than 10 years ago, Comverse established Comverse Infosys Technology as a separate subsidiary to meet the monitoring applications needs of some U.S. customers. This group maintains the high-level security clearances these customers require," said Baker. "In full compliance with U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) regulations, this subsidiary's operations are completely segregated from all other Comverse businesses and are insulated from any foreign influence," said Baker. "The board of directors overseeing these operations consists of former high-level military officers, including two retired Air Force generals appointed by the DOD. In addition, the DOD monitors Comverse Infosys Technology's operations to ensure they remain in full regulatory compliance. "All equipment supplied by Comverse complies with all applicable government security requirements. The notion that 'backdoor' access has been built into the systems is absurd. For more than 10 years, these systems have been sold to customers in more than 40 countries, who have subjected them to rigorous and continuous security testing without a single reported breach," said Baker. "As with any computer equipment that sits on a network, the Comverse systems are protected by the security measures and access restrictions imposed by the user of the network, whether a government agency or telephone operator. We fully support the evolving CALEA standard, and remain committed to maintaining our industry leadership in providing secure and reliable systems," concluded Baker. FBI Response Raises Questions Despite the extensive denials by Amdocs and Comverse, the curious response by the FBI has raised more questions than answers. Sources inside Capitol Hill are investigating the allegations and made no comments on the allegations of espionage at this time. However, the demands for answers continued to grow outside political circles. "If national security is the overriding issue in the FBI's treatment of this case, the correct response to your questions should have been 'Sorry, we have no comment at this time,'" said Douglas Brown of the Nathan Hale Institute. "Of course, the most reassuring response would have been 'There's no truth to the stories,' but apparently the bureau can't say that. Maybe the spokesperson is well-informed?" questioned Brown. "Something is up. One of the things that gave the Fox report added credibility was 'investigators within the DEA, INS and FBI have all told Fox News that to pursue or even suggest Israeli spying through Comverse is considered career suicide.' I think it pretty much captures the bizzaro world U.S. law enforcement and intelligence continues to operate in during the post-Clinton years," said Brown. "Everything is opposite still in their world, since the Clintonistas still control it. The more you screw up, the higher you go. Forget 'The West Wing' and 'The Agency' type shows, 'Seinfeld' reruns do a better job of capturing reality in D.C.," said Brown. "If the Israelis have used the companies named in the Fox reports for intelligence purposes, it lies somewhere between the Liberty incident and Jonathan Pollard affair for outrageousness. Yet, if true, one has to admire the creativity and ingenuity of Israeli intelligence," said Brown. Are Israeli Spies in the U.S.? "First, they have taken advantage of a technically bumbling and compromised law enforcement and counterintelligence community and may have essentially made U.S. law enforcement wiretapping activities a branch of Israeli intelligence. It would be quite impressive if true," noted Brown. "They have used their technical expertise in-house to identify and exploit cutting-edge technologies and companies. In gaining control over those technologies and companies, they would also have shown a deft handling of merger and acquisitions, personnel recruitment, and playing the capital markets. "In addition, as publicly traded companies, private and institutional investors from around the world would be funding Israeli intelligence activities. Again, pretty impressive, if true, and really pretty much the model, or a variation of the model, now used by the intelligence agencies of China, Russia and some of our European allies," said Brown. "If they [the Fox reports] do turn out to expose Israeli intelligence operations, one's admiration for Israeli ingenuity would be more than tempered by amazement at the sheer stupidity and recklessness of the Israelis' actions," noted Brown. "First, they would have seriously damaged their relationship with the United States on many levels. Since that relationship is fundamental to Israel's existence, not a smart move. "Second, while Israel, like the prodigal son, will always be able to ultimately rely on America's protection, Israeli high-tech companies are a major target for Russian intelligence and organized crime," stated Brown. Damage to U.S.-Israeli Relations "The prodigal son may have left our back door open to some of the most dangerous people in our global village. In other words, Israeli ingenuity in infiltrating and exploiting the U.S. high-tech industry may be seriously undermining the security and power of the country that is, in fact, the ultimate guarantor of its existence. Again, not a smart move," said Brown. "Finally, if the Israelis are using such a modus operandus for penetrating U.S. high-tech companies and government agencies, it is not a method of operation appropriate or necessary for a close ally to engage in. The risk of backlash and recriminations are much too great. Russian and Chinese use of such methods is understandable and a natural evolution and outgrowth of intelligence operations conducted for decades, but Israel should adhere more closely to the more open and, unfortunately, usually perfectly legal methods used by allies like Japan," stated Brown. "It looks like Louis Freeh may have another chapter to write in his memoirs - right after the Hanssen chapter," concluded Brown.

SOMALIA'S PRESIDENT SAYS THE USA TERRORIZES THE COUNTRY
The president of Somalias interim government says the population is
terrorized by a propagation campaign launched by the USA that tries to
present Somalia as the country that could become a shelter for Osama bin
Laden and his followers.
President Abdikassim Salad Hassan told in his interview to Reuters in
Sudans capital Khartoum, that fear of USs bombardments hampers peaceful
settlement in the country. Washington considers Somalia as a potential
target in the war against terrorism.
The people are terrified by a threat of USs attack on the poor country
destroyed after a ten-year civil war, told the president. He stressed once
again, no bin Ladens units were stationed in Somalia.
We want the international community to help Somalia unite, so that the
country could not become a center for terrorism in the future.
Speaking about resources designed for struggle with terrorism, Somalias
president mentioned problems of the government: governmental officials have
not been paid salaries for four months already, the Ministry for Information
has only one telephone line. He said, the feudal lords who want to throw off
the central government, try to profit by USs unexpected attention to
Somalia. For the sake of their selfish interests they want USs bombing in
Somalia to seize the power as the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan.
Abdikassim Salad Hassim says that Somalia is not like Afghanistan, and the
interim government is not like the Taliban and he himself is not Mullah
Mohammed Omar.
US officials visited the feudal lords, the opposition to Somalias
government in the southern town of Baidoa.
President Abdikassim reminded the USA about catastrophic consequences of its
humanitarian mission in Somalia at the beginning of the 90s. It is
evident, the president told, that only striving for peace, not for a new war
is the way to beat terrorism.

Forwarded From: frodeen (Frode E. Nyboe)
This is the English version of EFN's Norwegian press release.

PRESS RELEASE
FRIDAY, JANUARY 11, 2002
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
EFN DEMANDS ACQUITTAL AND FULL REDRESS FOR JON JOHANSEN
The civil rights movement Electronic Frontier Norway (EFN) notes
that Økokrim (The National Authority for Investigation and
Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime in Norway), after
two years of investigation, has brought charges against Jon
Johansen in the 'DVD case'.
Xkokrim's leader Inger Marie Sunde claims to the Norwegian News
Agency NTB that public interest necessitates indictment in this
EFN declares that this prosecution is opposed to public interest
and contributes to undermining and erasing fundamental consumer
rights.  The authorities are uncritically giving in to lobbying
from and a shortsighted and unchecked self-interest of American
film- and entertainment industry giants.
Jon Johansen, in collaboration with others, made a program (DeCSS)
which allows anyone to play a DVD-disc on computers which have
open operating systems such as Linux installed.  DeCSS circumvents
a software access control mechanism called CSS, which is
incorporated in most DVDs.  The essence in the DeCSS case is that
CSS restricts PLAYBACK, and NOT copying.  So in fact, CSS bars a
consumer from playing a legally obtained DVD disc in a player of
choice.  These kinds of restrictions on playback not only reduce
the value of the DVD disc to the consumer, they also erase the
right to watch a DVD where, when and how a consumer wants to.
CSS does not restrict the copying of DVDs, and can therefore not
be seen as a protection against unauthorized copying/piracy.
Piracy can be done with or without (bypassing) CSS.  However,
American film and entertainment industry giants have contrived,
via intense lobbying, to get laws passed which have made it
illegal to circumvent all types of digital restrictions
(software-based obstructions) on digital content.  These digital
restrictions are user access blocks that apply to playback as well
as copying.  This way, the consumer's right to choose playback
equipment, and the right to produce copies for personal use, has
effectively been outlawed.  This is no different than a law
restricting, for example, the right to copy music from a CD to an
audio tape for use in one's car or at work, or to create an audio
tape with one's own selection of music.
Unfortunately, there is a dangerous trend involving all types of
digital media and content whereby all carrier products of digital
content (such as DVDs, CDs, E-books, and others) are encumbered
with different types of user access restrictions which severely
impede or eliminate the user's ability to play back as well as
copy.  The reason or impetus for this trend is the film and
entertainment industry giants's unchecked craving for shortsighted
economic gain by forcing consumers to (1) buy playback equipment
at inflated prices (cheaper competing products are forced out of
the market by the digital access restrictions, thus establishing
an artificial monopoly) and (2) buy many separate copies of the
same work (one for the home, one for the car, one for the
workplace, one for the cell phone...).
EFN affirms that the indictment against Jon Johansen is alarming
and hostile to all consumer interests.  A ruling against Johansen
would imply a criminalization of normal and fundamental consumer
rights.  A victory for Jon Johansen, however, would be a victory
for all consumers, and a step in the right direction towards
restoring consumer rights and interests.  Jon Johansen is innocent
and must be found not guilty and be given full redress.

Lawmaker Wants Magic Lantern Information From FBI
By Robert MacMillan, Newsbytes
WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A.,
14 Jan 2002, 7:27 PM CST
Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, in a letter last week told the FBI that he is
concerned about the bureau's refusal to provide information about the
existence of a computer and e-mail surveillance plan dubbed "Magic Lantern."
In the letter, provided to the Politech mailing list by Paul's legislative
director Norman Singleton, the Congressman asked FBI Director Robert Mueller
to hand over information on the keystroke monitoring program, "or provide me
with written justification for the FBI's refusal to share information on
this crucial issue."
Paul asked for a response within two weeks.
"If ... media reports are accurate, the Magic Lantern project could greatly
impact the privacy and civil liberties of all Americans who communicate via
e-mail," Paul said. "Recently, my legislative director attempted to obtain
information on this project from the FBI and was told such information was
classified. Considering the potential impact of Magic Lantern, I am sure you
can understand why I was disturbed by this refusal."
Media reports have said that the FBI could distribute Magic Lantern the same
way worms thread through the Internet, which would eliminate the need for
law enforcement to physically install monitoring programs on suspect's
Privacy advocates are concerned that a program such as Magic Lantern could
help the FBI circumvent the normal process of subjecting to a court's
oversight when using surveillance tools.
FBI officials had no immediate comment on the letter.

Finally, A Solution To The DMCA!
August 23, 2001
For years, the geek community has been at the wrong end of
the War on Piracy waged by Hollywood lawyers.  The
situation could change, however, with the unveiling of a
secret weapon -- "The First Church Of Digital Grepping".
This newly created church argues that copying digital
information is a form of religious worship.  As such, it's
protected in the US by the freedom of religion clause in
the First Amendment.
"Rock beats scissors.  And Free Exercise of Religion beats
Digital Millennium Copyright Act(tm).  Ha ha, suckers!"
said the church's High Priest.
Chapter 16, Verse 256 of the Sacred Readme of the First
Church Of Digital Grepping  states:
   On the first day, the Great Programmer created a new
   text file and the Universe was born.
   The Great Programmer flexed his fingers, started
   hacking, and entered Deep Hack Mode.
   First He wrote universe.c.  Then sys/laws_of_physics.h
   and universal_constants.h.  The Great Programmer
   continued his Hacking Binge into the second day  with
   sol.c, which begat terra.c, which begat land_and_sea.c,
   which laid the foundation for the creation of life.c.
   On the third day, He gazed upon his Program and saw that
   it was good.  More he produced: prokaryotes.c,
   eukaryotes.c, sys/dna.h, invertebrates.c, vertebrates.c.
   On the fourth day, the Great Programmer, against his
   better judgement,  coded mankind.c.
   On the fifth day, He compiled his work, and received
   1,024 errors.
   On the sixth day, He debugged.
   On the seventh day, He continued to debug.  Rest is for
   the weak.
   On the eight day, the debugging continued.  Only 128
   compiler warnings did He now receive.
   On the ninth day, the program compiled correctly.  Upon
   execution, it immediately coredumped.
   On the tenth day, The Great Programmer debugged.
   On the eleventh day, He debugged.
   On the twelfth day, He waved a dead chicken, but the
   Great Program continued to segfault.
   On the thirteenth day, He discovered the fatal flaw, a
   misplaced comma He did find.  And then void main()
   executed, and the Big Bang did occur.
   Then the Great Programmer leaned back in his executive
   chair, and gazed upon the newborn Universe.
   And frowned.  He knew those sentient humans would be a
   problem. Even after He had sweated over a hot terminal
   for thirteen days, those humans were ungrateful.  They
   called their place of existence the "Universe", not the
   "Great Programmer/Universe".
   On the fourteenth day, he decided to take action.  He
   would send these humans The Meaning Of Life, and soon
   the world would worship Him and his Hacking Skills.
   He did just that.  He inspired a certain human to
   produce a work of art which includes His message, The
   Meaning Of Life.  Eventually the humans would discover
   the .plan of the Great Programmer hidden in a certain
   work of art and all would be well...
The Sacred Readme is a tad vague, but the church's High
Priest believes that "The Meaning Of Life" is encoded in
either a popular song, or a Hollywood movie, or an Adobe
"If only we could figure out which 'work of art' the Sacred
Readme refers to, and then grep through the binary
representation to extract the divine message," the High
Priest explains.
The mission of the church is to make digital copies of
every music CD, every movie DVD, and every printed book and
then grep the digital version for any tell-tale signs of
'The Meaning Of Life'."
"Our church cannot function if the DMCA prohibits us from
making copies as part of the Fair Use Doctrine.  We worship
the Great Programmer by trying to discover His secret
message.  Why should we put the profits of Big Evil
Corporations above the search for The Meaning Of Life?"
Of course, the MPAA, RIAA, DVD-CCA, BSA, and other groups
see things slightly differently.
"This is all bull," said a MPAA spokesperson.  "We didn't
buy a slate of Congressmen to get the DMCA passed just so
some fake parody religion could claim a bogus exemption!"
An investigator for Oracle discovered a hand-written copy
of the Sacred Readme while rummaging through the High
Priest's trash cans.  The P.I. believes that the holy
document was actually written last Wednesday when the High
Priest had a little too much to drink.
The founder of the church stands his ground, however.  "I
wasn't drunk last Wednesday," he argues, "I was busy trying
to find the divine message within a copy of 'Star Trek
XXIII: We Promise This Movie Doesn't Include Any Annoying
Characters Like Jar Jar Binks' on my big-screen projection
TV.  Needless to say, I came up empty."
The judges in the California Sixth District Court of
Appeals were all unavailable for comment at press time.

Homeland Security, Homeland Profits
By Wayne Madsen
Special to CorpWatch
December 21, 2001
WASHINGTON, DC -- Recent moves to beef up intelligence gathering in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks have civil libertarians concerned that law enforcement agencies will entangle many law abiding citizens and social justice groups in their surveillance missions. Intelligence networks are setting their sights on the Internet, which up to now has had no clear privacy guidelines. Under the provisions of the inaptly named anti-terrorism act, "USA-PATRIOT," the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and a number of other smaller law enforcement agencies are looking for ways to monitor the Internet and mine useful intelligence from it. And new technology makes it easier than ever to spy on the Internet.
Although law enforcement and intelligence agencies claim they are merely looking for information to counter future acts of terrorism, the definition of "terrorism" is being expanded to cover non-violent groups that have traditionally used the Internet to marshal resistance to corporate-inspired globalization. Politicians are already painting dissent as "unpatriotic" and therefore somehow linked to terrorism.
Meanwhile, a phalanx of software companies, consultants, and defense contractors stand to reap billions of dollars over the next few years by selling surveillance and information-gathering systems to government agencies and the private sector.
Technology Already in the Hands of Law Enforcement
Law enforcement agencies like the FBI already have at their disposal a massive information sharing network through which federal, state, local, and foreign police forces can exchange information on groups felt to pose a threat. The system, RISSNET, or Regional Information Sharing System Network, which existed before the September 11th attacks, recently got a boost when Congress authorized additional money for it in the USA PATRIOT Act.
RISSNET is a secure intranet that connects 5,700 law enforcement agencies in all 50 states, as well as agencies in Ontario and Quebec, the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Australia. According to sources close to the Washington Metropolitan Police, data on targeted local groups such as the Alliance for Global Justice, the anti-World Bank/International Monetary Fund activist organization, has been shared with other jurisdictions through RISSNET.
RISSNET has also been used to coordinate the monitoring of the activities of anti-globalization protestors in Seattle, Quebec City, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Washington DC and Genoa. For example, when the FBI seized network server logs from Independent Media Center (IMC) in Seattle during the April 2001 anti-free trade protests in Quebec City, RISSNET was used to coordinate activities across jurisdictional boundaries. The IMC, founded during the 1999 WTO protests, allows activists and independent journalists to post directly to its site.
State and metropolitan police intelligence units also monitor the web sites of activist organizations in their jurisdictions. All RISS intelligence is archived by an Orwellian-sounding entity called MAGLOCLEN or "Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network." There are other regional RISS intelligence centers around the country with equally mysterious acronyms. MAGLOCLEN, a nerve center headquartered in Newtown, Pennsylvania, distributes political intelligence to all police departments hooked up to RISSNET.
MAGLOCLEN allows police investigators to link various activist groups and members through the Link Association Analysis sub-system, a relational data base that identifies the "friends and families" of groups and individuals. The Telephone Record Analysis sub-system can call up records of phone calls of targeted groups and individuals. A suspect group's banking and other commercial data can be monitored by the Financial Analysis sub-system. And through a system that would have been the envy of J. Edgar Hoover, police and federal agents can also call up profiles that provide specific information on the composition of organizations, including their membership lists. The Justice Department has instituted a project called RISSNET II, which directly links the individual databases contained within the various RISS centers.
The FBI also runs its own intranet called Law Enforcement On-line or "LEO," which allows it to communicate intelligence with select other law enforcement agencies. In the aftermath of September 11th , the FBI is under pressure to open up LEO to more police agencies so they can have access to more real-time intelligence. If Attorney General John Ashcroft lifts restrictions placed on the FBI's collection of political intelligence, undoubtedly information on the First Amendment activities of American citizens will wind up in the Bureau's computer databases.
"There has been no indication that the FBI needs expanded spying powers," says Center for Constitutional Rights attorney Michael Ratner. "We should learn from history; spying on dissent is not only unlawful but it is abusive."
This kind of surveillance is not new. In the 1960s and 70s, the FBI's Counter Intelligence Program, known as COINTELPRO, was used to gather personal details on the lives and habits of a wide array of activists ranging from public figures like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., actress Jane Fonda and noted pediatrician Benjamin Spock, to members of local anti-war and civil rights groups. This information was often used to disrupt lawful organizing and protest activities.
A modern-day FBI list might include any group deemed "terrorist" by any law enforcement agencies, the military, or criminal prosecutors. That could subject organizations as varied -- and unconnected to terrorism -- as Earth First, Greenpeace, the American Indian Movement, the Zapatista National Liberation Front, ACT UP, and their supporters to a wide array of high-tech surveillance and eavesdropping tools.
Chief among spy agency tools is an e-mail sniffing program known as Carnivore. Changes brought about by USA-PATRIOT allow federal law enforcement officials to petition a secretive federal court called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for warrants to tap phones, read e-mail, or break and enter into homes or offices to conduct searches and plant bugging devices. These spy activities can be carried out without proof that an organization has links to terrorists or foreign intelligence agencies.
To read e-mail the FBI can order an Internet Service Provider to place a special monitoring computer called Carnivore (now renamed Data Collection System 1000) on its network servers. The FBI can then select the e-mail of surveillance targets for capture and storage. Not content with this device, the FBI now seeks to expand its surveillance capability to the entire Internet.
Making a Buck off of Government Spying
Companies that are positioning themselves to help the government surveill the web came out in force at a recent Homeland Security Conference in Washington. They included Oracle, Microsoft, Information Builders, Choice Point, Man Tech, AMS, and Booz Allen & Hamilton. Government speakers from civilian and military agencies all stressed that they urgently need the technology to store surveillance-derived intelligence and exchange it with other agencies. If these corporations step up to the plate on developing new surveillance, monitoring, and biometric ID systems, they stand to make billions.
Companies like Top Layer Networks, Inc. of Westboro, Massachusetts, are developing ways for the FBI to install surveillance systems at a few key Internet hubs which would allow federal agents to remotely flip a switch and pound a few keys to begin monitoring the e-mail or web-based mail of any targeted group or individual. According to chief Top Layer engineer Ken Georgiades, the firm is working with a number of partners to develop new standards for the legal interception of communications at the Internet Service Provider level and at higher gigabit speeds.
The higher gigabit intercept equipment would be placed at major Internet backbone hubs in strategic locations like Washington, DC, the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles. Georgiades said that the 1994 Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) does not currently extend to the Internet and only applies to telecommunications companies. However, the fact that Top Layer and its unspecified partners are ramping up to deliver CALEA-like wiretapping services for the Internet indicates the FBI sees the power of CALEA growing beyond phone lines to the web. And Georgiades pointed out that foreign governments are under no such constraints and can use Internet snooping equipment under existing current wiretapping laws.
David Banisar, Research Fellow at Harvard's Information Infrastructure Project, said such systems "set a dangerous precedent to allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to run the communications system." He added, "these agencies take an over-inclusive view of who they think are the enemies and its likely that civil and human rights groups will, again, be monitored for no legitimate reason."
The large defense and intelligence consulting and engineering firm Booz, Allen & Hamilton has not only developed the FBI's Carnivore capability but it has assisted the bureau in ensuring that all telecommunications companies engineer their systems to ensure they are "wiretap friendly." The companies are required by the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act to ensure the FBI has access to all forms of telecommunications, including cellular What if a target decides to use encryption to protect their e-mail from interception? That is not a problem for the FBI. Booz Allen & Hamilton has helped develop a system code-named Magic Lantern, which permits a virus containing a key logging program to be secretly transmitted to a recipient. After installing itself on the target's computer, any time the target types in a password to decrypt a message, that same password is immediately picked up by Magic Lantern and transmitted to the FBI. Essentially, the FBI has a virtual master key to break any encryption program used by a surveillance target.
A companion program to Magic Lantern, code named Cyber Knight, is a relational database system that compares and matches information from e-mail, Internet relay chats, instant messages, and Internet voice Not to be outdone by the FBI, the CIA has also been extremely active in developing software than can dig deep within the Internet to harvest information. The CIA has relied heavily on its wholly-owned and operated proprietary Silicon Valley company, IN-Q-TEL, to fund research and development for Internet snooping software. IN-Q-TEL's President and Chief Executive Officer Gilman Louie is to keynote a January 2002 Las Vegas seminar on the use of emerging intelligence technology to search and analyze the web. He is to be joined by Joan Dempsey, the Deputy Director of the CIA for Intelligence Community Management. IN-Q-TEL's web page describes the aggressive attitude the CIA is taking toward ensuring new technologies come complete with the spy agency's seal of approval, "IN-Q-TEL strives to extend the Agency's access to new IT companies, solutions, and approaches to address their priority problems."
Assisting the government in its goals to gather massive amounts of personal information on citizens and non-citizens, is a company that owes its very existence to the CIA. Oracle, Inc. Chairman Larry Ellison has offered to provide to the government free of charge the database software required to establish an interactive national ID card system. Oracle got its start when the CIA gave Ellison a contract in the 1970s to design a system to enable the agency to store and retrieve massive amounts if information in databases. Not coincidentally, the code name of that CIA project was "Oracle."
The rush by the government to monitor the Internet has the backing of a group of federal contract research facilities that have pounded out report after report warning about the threat of cyberspace to national security. These "think tanks" include Rand Corporation and Analytical Services Corporation (ANSER). They are assisted in this policy laundering effort by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the K Street rest home for former Pentagon, intelligence, and State Department political appointees.
But all the technology in the world will not protect citizens from terrorist attacks, unless the government knows how to use the information effectively. As the government and a few selected companies and think tanks push for new surveillance laws and more monitoring of the Internet and telecommunications in general, the words of Mary Schiavo, the Transportation Department's former Inspector General and outspoken critic of lax airline security, are particularly poignant. Speaking in Washington on December 18, Schiavo pointed out that the "United States already had laws to prevent what happened on September 11th . . . they weren't being enforced."

DRUGS SQUAD FUMES AS BOOKSHOP SHIELDS READER
Prize-Winning US Writers Queue Up To Defend Privacy Of Customer Who Bought
Uncle Fester's Illicit Manual
It never won a Pulitzer or appeared on the New York Times bestseller lists
but a 400-page book about the manufacture of illicit drugs by an author
known as Uncle Fester is at the centre of a legal battle over the privacy
of the US book-buying public. In what has been described as a landmark case
for the US book industry, the Tattered Cover bookshop in Denver, Colorado,
has spent 18 months resisting the attempts of both police and courts to
obtain the identity of a customer who purchased Uncle Fester's opus,
Advanced Techniques of Clandestine Drug Laboratories .
Many of the country's most celebrated authors, publishers and booksellers
are supporting the shop, which has argued that handing over the information
would be a serious attack on free speech.
'There is a right to privacy in this country and that includes the right to
read what we like without government interference,' says award-winning
novelist Michael Chabon. 'If the police get what they are after in this
case, what is to stop them demanding to know all sorts of things - like who
has been reading books about any subject the authorities deem to be
'dangerous', such as religious beliefs that don't fit into the so-called
Chabon, who won the Pulitzer last year for his novel The Amazing Adventures
of Kavalier and Clay, is one of several leading writers, including David
Eggers, Dorothy Allison and the children's book author Daniel Handler, who
have giving financial support to the Tattered Cover's legal defence fund,
along with the American Booksellers' Foundation.
'People shop in bookstores on the understanding that their choices are
confidential,' says Chris Finan, president of the ABF's Foundation for Free
Expression. 'There are a lot of books about subjects - mental health,
sexual dysfunction - that we do not want our wives or husbands to know
we've been reading about. If people know the police can get that kind of
information they will not shop for those books.'
The case centres on a raid by drug enforcement officers at a trailer park
near Denver in March last year. The Uncle Fester book and another called
Advanced Techniques of Clandestine Psychedelic Drug Laboratories were found
inside a trailer owned by a man suspected of operating a methamphetamine
lab. An envelope discovered in his rubbish bin contained an invoice from
the Tattered Cover.
The following day four plainclothes officers arrived at the shop with a
search warrant, demanding to know if the books were bought there and, if
so, by whom. The shop's owner, Joyce Meskis, refused to provide the
information. 'It is not our job to do the police's work for them,' she said.
Denver police then asked that it enforce the subpoena. At a subsequent
hearing, lawyers for the bookshop argued the police had failed to interview
other witnesses who could have helped convict the suspect. Details of a
customer's purchasing record were not sufficiently important to the
criminal case to justify the 'chilling effect' that releasing such
information would have on the right to free speech enshrined in the First
Amendment, they said.
However, the court upheld the police request - a decision which has been
challenged by the shop's owners in the State's Supreme Court. A ruling on
the appeal is expected in the next few weeks.
The case has echoes of that brought by Kenneth Starr against two bookshops
in Washington DC during his investigation into the Monica Lewinsky
'scandal'. When it emerged that Lewinsky - who was said to have given
President Clinton several books as presents - was a regular customer at the
shops, Starr demanded to see her purchase records. The shops' owners
resisted his request, but the case never reached court after Lewinsky
struck a deal with the former Independent Counsel.
Finan said yesterday there was a growing problem with authorities seeking
private information from bookshops. 'I'm afraid this may be a bad idea
whose time has come, and the chilling effect on publishing could be very
serious indeed. In the Lewinsky case, a false rumour went around that the
bookshops were going to comply with Starr's request. The effect of that was
they saw a big fall-off in business. People trust bookstores to protect
them. If they don't have that trust, they will not shop there.'
The Tattered Cover, spread over four floors in downtown Denver, is a
required stop on the book tour schedule for every bestselling author and
has a reputation for stocking radical, independently published books that
have little chance of finding shelf space in chain stores such as Borders
and Barnes and Noble.
Meskis said she had been heartened by the support she and her staff had
received from writers, publishers and the public. More than 400 people
turned up at a fund-raising event at a San Francisco bookshop last night.
'Like us, they realise that everyone in society has to do what they can to
uphold the rule of law but that we also have an obligation to the community
to protect the constitution. When you have one responsibility bumping up
against another, then that's when the courts should decide.'

This article adds to the discussion that the Taliban are PoWs.
   Once in front of a court or tribunal, the Pentagon might argue that
   the Taliban were not the government of Afghanistan and that their
   armed forces were not the armed forces of a party to the convention.
   The problem here is that the convention is widely regarded as an
   accurate statement of customary international law, unwritten rules

By Richard Benke, Associated Press, 1/12/2002
LOS ALAMOS, N.M. - In a new memoir, former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee
says the nuclear ''crown jewels'' he was accused of mishandling were really
the ''crown junk'' and were not vital to national security.
The files he downloaded were old, with much of the information already
public and very little of it classified, Lee says in ''My Country Versus
Me,'' published by Hyperion. He says he copied the material onto tapes
because he had lost files before and did not trust the computer system.
He describes himself as a loyal ''Cold Warrior'' for the United States, yet
says the FBI threatened him with execution if he did not confess to giving
nuclear secrets to China.
''I want to share through this book how I fell into a trap,'' Lee says,
''one slippery step at a time, not even realizing what was happening until
it was too late.''
Lee, a Taiwanese-born naturalized US citizen, was arrested in December 1999
and indicted on 59 felony counts alleging he transferred nuclear weapons
information to portable computer tapes. He was held in solitary confinement
for nine months, but never charged with spying.
As the government's case crumbled, Lee pleaded guilty to a felony count of
downloading sensitive material, and was set free. The mishandling of the
case was an embarrassment for the FBI and the Justice Department.
While Lee was behind bars, one senior scientist called the files ''the crown
Lee says the downloaded tapes were all work-related, routine, and contained
in a secure area at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
''In fact, the `crown jewels' are largely the crown junk,'' he says. ''This
is the biggest nuclear weapons secret that LANL and the government have to
Lee says he copied the files - needed to design computer simulations for
nuclear explosions - so he could have backup copies.
''In 1993, I lost several files as a result of a computer system conversion
at the lab,'' he says. ''One of the codes I lost was about nuclear reactor
safety. ... This was an important code, and it was gone.''
A call to the US attorney's office in Albuquerque yesterday was not
immediately returned.
Lee, who has been a US citizen since 1974 and spent 20 years doing
top-secret work at the lab, is suing the government for defamation and
claims he was targeted because he is ethnic Chinese.
In a recent deposition made public yesterday, former energy secretary Bill
Richardson said that ethnicity was not a factor in his firing of Lee or the
decision to investigate him for possible security breaches.

@_subject: Is George W. Bush God's President? 
January 10, 2002|2:05 PM
Rudolph Giuliani, a devout but not excessively rigorous Catholic, announced
that `there was some divine guidance in the President being elected.'
Is George W. Bush God's President?
by Joe Conason
Do tax cuts for the wealthy represent the will of God?
What might normally be an impertinent and perhaps offensive question
suddenly seems entirely reasonable after hearing George W. Bush's
ungrammatical but passionate pledge to defend the tax cuts his
administration provided to the richest, smallest segment of American
citizens, at the cost of his own life if need be. The vow he uttered during
his town-hall meeting in California over the weekend - "Not over my dead body
will they raise your taxes!" - was the strongest he's made on any subject
since his promise to deliver Osama bin Laden to justice "dead or alive."
Even allowing for hyperbole, such edgy remarks indicate what matters most to
Mr. Bush. For the moment, however, he appears more capable of fulfilling the
former promise than the latter. And since it has lately become respectable
to discuss his elevation to the nation's highest office as a matter of
divine will, Mr. Bush's deep determination to empty the Treasury into the
pockets of friends and supporters may likewise signify the unknowable agenda
of the Almighty.
Unbelievers will scoff at such notions, but in the wake of Sept. 11, the
idea that a higher power ordained the inauguration of Mr. Bush is no longer
confined to the loonier fringes of the religious right. While the President
and the First Lady modestly demur whenever this topic comes up, others
around the Oval Office assert that they are convinced. "I think President
Bush is God's man at this hour," a top White House aide told a religious
publication not long ago. Ralph Reed, the former director of the Christian
Coalition who now chairs the G.O.P. in Georgia, says his fellow evangelicals
believe God selected the President because "He knew George Bush had the
ability to lead in this compelling way."
Nor is this revelation confined solely to Protestant conservatives. Two days
before Christmas, Rudolph Giuliani, a devout but not excessively rigorous
Catholic, announced his own opinion that "there was some divine guidance in
the President being elected." In this sentiment, the Time magazine "Man of
the Year" was swiftly seconded by a Catholic bishop. (Again, a skeptic might
impiously wonder why the Lord didn't simply bless Mr. Bush with the actual
majority of votes. But faith is nothing without mystery.)
The implications of all this are obviously profound. If the President is
indeed guided by Providence in lavishing additional billions upon those who
already enjoy so much material abundance - even while the numbers of
unemployed, uninsured and homeless soar - then his ascension may represent a
millennial reversal of heavenly policy.
Until now, few directives have been clearer than the guidance enunciated by
prophets of both the Old and New Testaments regarding earthly greed. "Woe to
you who are rich," Jesus told his disciples, "for you have already received
your comfort." The impoverished carpenter also reportedly informed a
well-heeled acquaintance that it is "easier for a camel to go through the
eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." His
best-known speech included the admonition that "you cannot serve both God
and Mammon."
Universally familiar as those statements are, they are reliably among the
most widely ignored. Entire schools of theology, across all ecumenical
lines, have long been devoted to parsing a convenient loophole in such
injunctions. They aren't the sort of Biblical quotations that politicians
try to post in public schools, or that televangelists cite as evidence that
Republicans are the party of God. What a relief it would be if the tax
policy of the Bush administration means that we no longer have to worry
about worshipping the golden calf.
Divine inspiration may not be a persuasive explanation for Mr. Bush's fiscal
schemes, which are pushing the government into deficit and threatening to
prolong the recession. It is indeed hard to imagine that any omniscient
power would prefer a $254 million tax break for Enron to a cut in payroll
taxes for the working poor. But it's just as difficult to credit any of the
more earthly justifications emanating from the White House press office.
In any case, not all branches of the federal government have awakened yet to
the new dispensation. On the same day that Mr. Bush made his "dead body"
remark, a report issued by the Congressional Budget Office disparaged his
tax cuts as useless for reviving the economy. According to the C.B.O.
analysis, better results would ensue from more progressive cuts in payroll
and sales taxes. While the nonpartisan report appropriately said nothing
about theology, its recommendations were highly reminiscent of that
old-fashioned scriptural preference for the poor and the toilers.
So perhaps Mr. Bush's supporters should reconsider their political epiphany.
The followers of the last public figure who claimed to be executing God's
will are now dodging daisy-cutters.

@_subject: [Anti_Immigration] Jewish Left vs Christian Right & Immigration 
Reply-To: Anti_Immigration
[Below is a discussion between Nissan who is a right-wing Israeli Jew and Bob from Michigan who is a Right-wing Christian that I found@
 - THIS IS A MUST Dear Nissan & BCC friends, What is the definition of hypocrisy? Advocating one set of rules for yourself and another set of rules for others? Jews in Israel oppose multi-culturalism but Jews in America are forcing multi-culturalism on WASP America. Jews in Israel are very strict about who can immigrate to Israel, but Jews in America have forced an immigration policy upon our nation that is 90% non-white and 95% non-Christian. [Side Bar: For more information about Jewish influence upon American Immigration policy go read "The Jewish Stake in America's Changing Demography, Reconsidering a Misguided Immigration Policy," By Stephen Steinlight at  - It is written by a Jew who was formerly pro-immigration and he explains why most Jews are pro-immigration. He talks about the immense and formidable Jewish political power in America. He talks about Jewish control of Hollywood and the news media. He talks about Jewish Supremacism inculcated in young Jewish Americans. He talks about how Jews have divided loyalties and how they often put the interests of Israel ahead of American interests. He talks about the intentional program of the Internationalists to make White's a minority in America in the near future via unlimited immigration and open borders policies. He talks about the Jewish affinity for Marxism. He talks about the Jewish drive for remaking America into a pluralistic and secular society. He explains that MTV is a tool of indoctrination which is being used to promote a radical agenda that includes multi-racialism. You must read this article and pass it on. There are a growing number of Jews who are coming around to conservatism, I just hope they come around sooner rather than later.]
Jews in America control and finance strongly anti-Christian groups like the ACLU, People for the American Way (PAW), Americans United for Separation of Church and State and many other such groups. This is anti-Christian bigotry. But most Jews (like you?) are only concerned about one kind of bigotry, "anti-semitism." You are completely oblivious to the anti-Christian bigotry of your fellow Jews. That is hypocrisy my friend and I am damned angry about it. It is OK for Jewish Hollywood to attack my values and beliefs in nearly EVERY DAMN MOVIE THEY MAKE IN JEWISH HOLLYWOOD, but you Jews can't stop whining about my supposed "anti-semitism." You have a double standard my friend. On the one hand you support the idea that Israel should be a nation that enshrines support for Judaism in its legal code, but on the other hand you do not think America should be a Christian nation with support for Christianity written into our legal code. Jews in America think that America should be a secular nation. I am telling you the truth when I say, I love Jews. I love the real Jews who love Moses, love the Torah, are pro-Life, anti-Homosexual, pro-Gun, anti-socialism. The real Jews are my allies in the political arena. I hate the bastard Left-wing Jews who have turned America away from her Protestant Christian roots. I want those atheist fag-loving gun-hating socialist Jews out of America. Do you likewise want those atheist fag-loving gun-hating socialist Jews out of Israel? Do you hate those atheist fag-loving gun-hating socialist Jews as much as I do? These Left-wing Jews are the CANCER OF AMERICA. It is sad to report the truth that 80 or 90% of Jews in America are far Left-wing, anti-Christian bigots who support abortion rights, homosexual rights, pornography, gun control laws, socialized medicine and environmental extremism.
It is so very difficult for human beings to set aside their personal prejudices and look at each situation objectively, but that is what I am going to ask you to do. I am asking you to try to pretend that you are a Christian. I ask you to see things from my point of view. I will do the same in this email. I will try to see things from your point of view. First, let me start with an analogy. Lets pretend that you are an Israeli. Lets pretend that you are an agent in the Mossad. Lets pretend that you have penetrated to the highest levels of Bin Ladens organization. Lets say that you are at a meeting of all of the major leaders of Bin Laden's terrorist organization. At this meeting of 60 of the highest leaders of Bin Laden's organization you discover that they are planning a major terrorist action against civilians in Israel that will kill perhaps a 100, 000 Israeli's. Now here is your dilema: The Mossad has provided you with a Bomb, but you only have one bomb. This is your choice, you can use the bomb to destroy the entire leadership of your enemy, Bin Ladens terrorist organization and the approximately 60 "Generals" in Bin Laden's organization or you can go to the staging site where multiple thousands of low level but highly trained terrorists are getting ready to depart for their mission of terror in Israel. Here is the question, where do you use the bomb? Do you focus on the Generals who are the brains in the army of evil or do you focus on the far more numerous low level peons in the army of evil? Who should you try to neutralize? The leaders or the far more numerous peons. I assert that if you cut off the head the body will die. I assert that you need to focus on those who are supplying the money and the brains and the plans for the Army of evil. Here is my assertion that I hope you will agree with... it is much wiser to focus on the leadership in the army of evil. Do you agree with this as a general principle? I think it is a foregone conclusion. I think that the answer is obvious. I think it would be foolish to do anything other than focus on the leadership in the army of evil. You were wrong. You asserted that I am anti-semitic. I am not. I am focused like a laser on the Generals in the Army of evil. It is sad and unfortunate that such a high percentage of the Jews are Generals in the army of evil that is destroying America. I want you to get inside the heart of a Christian. I want you to see things from a Christian point of view. Please try very hard. Now lets look facts about Jews in America and the wealth they control and the influence they wield in our nations capital. These atheist liberal Jews are extremely powerful and they are totally anti-Christian. The liberal Jews who control Hollywood are using their media to indoctrinate the American populace in pro-homosexual, pro-sexual immorality, anti-Christian, anti-conservative concepts of every kind. The liberal Jews who control the ACLU are viciously anti-Christian and are destroying America's Christian underpinnings. Please I beg you to go into your prayer closet and pray before writing back to me. Ask YHWH to help you to see things from a Christian point of view. Lets look at what these Jews, who are generals in the army of evil, that is destroying the moral fabric of America, lets look at what they have done. Hollywood has mocked family values for decades. Hollywood has promoted sex outside of marriage and promoted the entire sexual revolution. Hollywood has warped the thinking of several generations of American youth until we have reached the point where our families are in near total chaos. I blame this on the army of evil called liberalism. Who are the "generals" in the army of evil liberalism in America? It is true that without Jewish money the Democratic party would fold. It is true that 50% of the money that goes to the Democratic party comes from Jews, which is very shocking when you consider that Jews are only 2% of the total population in America. Please try to see this from the conservative Christian point of view. These Jews are wrecking our nation. Yes there are a 100 times, a thousand times more liberals who are non-Jews. But friend we need to look at the Generals in the army of evil and see what percentage of the Generals are liberal Jews. We need to see what percentage of the money that finances left-wing organizations, comes from Jews. Friend, you know better than I do how much money the liberal Jews give to support the entire panopoly of far left-wing organizations. I am asserting that if all Jews in America were right wing, the Democratic party would be DEAD. Liberalism would be DEAD! Jews have lead or financed every far left-wing cause in America. Were there a 100 times more non-Jews in these left-wing organizations, YES, but they had neither the money nor the positions of power in those left-wing org's that the Jews did. These atheist Jews are the Generals in satan army of evil that is wrecking America. This information is not anti-semitic. This is truth. You know that I am not lying. You know that everything I have written in this email is factual. It is very sad that 80 to 90% of American Jews are far left-wing. It is very sad that most Jews support the Clintons, support the homosexual rights movement, support the ACLU, support gun control laws, support banning every mention of Christianity from the public schools, support the marxist feminist movement, support the interpretation of the first amendment to include pornography, support socialized medicine and support socialism and big government in general. It is very sad that Jews were in the forefront of the communist movement in every western nation. It is very sad that Jews have been deceived and have rejected Moses, rejected G-ds Law and have rejected G-d himself. But it is time for you to come to grips with this truth: Jews have been very damaging to America. Will you list all the good things Jews have done? Scientific and medical discoveries, etc, etc. I will list a hundred times more damaging things that these atheist liberal Jews have done to America. It is the liberal Jews, the so called Jewish "humanists" who have brought America to this point of moral implosion. They have been weighed in the scales of justice and they have been found wanting. THIS INFORMATION IS NOT ANTI-SEMITIC. THIS IS THE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. STOP USING THAT BLUDGEON ON ME. I AM NOT ANTI-SEMITIC. If you call me anti-semitic then what names shall be left for you to use on the real haters, the real Nazi's? I DO NOT HATE ALL JEWS. I love you and I love all of the Jews who are politically conservative and allies of the Christian Right. I would love to have you as a neighbor and I welcome conservative Jews like you into my heart and into our nation. But further than that I don't even wish ill for the liberal Jews. I wish that you would convert them to Judaism. I wish you would convert them to believe in the G-d of Abraham, Issac and Jacob and turn them away from their current state of atheism. Yes, I focus on the Jews and I insist that it is not anti-semitic for me to do so. I attack the Jews because I see them as the Generals in the evil army of those promoting the leftist agenda that is destroying all that I hold dear. This is self-defense and nothing more. These atheist liberal Jews are super wealthy, super successful and super influential and they are using all of that power to destroy the America that I knew in my youth. It is not wrong and it is not anti-semitic to tell this truth.
Now I am going to try to see things from your point of view. Help me if I misunderstand. The Jewish people have collective memories of thousands of years of persecution culminating in the Holocaust. You and other Jews look at the things I write and your first thought is about where thinking like this could lead if the majority of Christians started thinking this way about Jews. It is a frightening thought to a Jew. So even if this Bob guy is a decent fellow and he is not really one of the haters, you must marginalize Bob because of the potential fearful possibilities of these ideas about Jews spreading in the minds of the sheeple. I can feel the fear in my own heart. If I was a Jew I also would fear such thoughts and such writings because of the potential end result of such ideas becoming dominant in the minds of the majority populace. I think I understand your point of view (Do you understand mine?). But my answer to you is to work harder on converting Jews to conservatism and converting Jews to faithful Judaism so that they are not enemies of the Christian Right. The answer is NOT to shut up the truth about what 80 to 90% of Jews are doing in America. The answer is NOT to belittle and disparage a sincere Christian who is acting only in self-defense by calling him an ANTI-SEMITE! Can you see things from my point of view? I am sincerely yours with the greatest of respect for you, Your friend, Bob from Michigan.
PS - I do not believe in "conspiracy theory." I believe that all of history is a battle of ideas. I believe that most Jews are my enemy in the battle of ideas, so please stop trying to tag me with the "conspiracy" label. PPS - SEE MY COMMENTS ON YOUR LETTER IN ALL "CAPS" BELOW. Well, Bob, I am glad you answered my e-mail.
What makes your philosophy an interesting combination of right-wing  politics and anti-Semitism is that throughout your answers, you still insist on singling out the Jews for special treatment, which is CONTRARY to my understanding of right-wing, merit-based philosophy - with your only  reason for it being "they got money" - like some jealous, Communist  revolutionary. If a certain group is more successful than another - like the Orientals  in America as opposed to the Blacks, for instance - that is the strength  of an open, free market society like America.
Secondly, Jews support lots of things.  A Jewish left-winger supports  the Rainbow Coalition for the same inane, stupid reasons that any Boston  white, Anglo-Saxon liberal supports it. You, however, insinuate some  conspiratorial plan by Jews to destroy America. You are wrong. Ditto for world  government - Jews are not in a conspiracy to take over the world. That implies a  special evil motivation for Jews (i.e., anti-Semitism). I reapeat: Jews who  support leftist insanities support them for the same reason that anyone else of  any other ethnicity does.
What if I told you that most Americans of Italian background support  liberal immigration laws? You'd find a reason - they want to make sure their relatives can get in and join them, etc.Would you say "AHAH! They are  trying to take over America for a renewed fascist Italy!" Jews are motivated  by the same things anyone else is.
Thirdly, targeting Jews for extermination because they are taking over  the world (or America)... that is ancient, classical anti-Semitism exactly  for the reasons I listed above.
As for Israel. It is the fulfillment of the prophesy of the ingathering  of the exiles. Zionism seeks one thing: a Jewish State where Jews will be  able to take their destiny in their own hands. I don't care what your friend  told you. It was either a wishful, lefty, John Lennon, peace and love speech  that he assumed is an insidious plan for world conquest (which is what most  of these conspiracy theories are) or he is making up nonsense. Zionism is  the OPPOSITE of one-world government - it demands that Jews have an  independent, separate state, where most Jews will live. That is a call for yet  another national entity, not an international one. You'll just have to trust me  that you cannot lecture me about Zionism or Judaism or Israeli history or policies.
[ IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ORTHODOX JEWS WERE NEARLY ALL OPPOSED TO ZIONISM BECAUSE THEY INTERPRETED PROPHECY TO SAY THAT ISRAEL WOULD NOT BE A NATION AGAIN UNTIL THE COMING OF THE MESSIAH. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF HISTORY THAT ZIONISM WAS STARTED AND PROMOTED BY ATHEIST RUSSIAN JEWS WHO WERE MARXISTS. ]
If you oppose Jewish national sovereignty, then the burden is on you to  show why you support other national sovereignties. Mostly, in fact, it is leftist, internationalist, pie in the sky types who are anti-Israel,  because they are anti-nationalism of any kind. But YOU are pro-nationalist. So  if you are in favor of all other nationalisms, but the Jewish one, then  that is, again, anti-Semitism, just from the perspective of logic. Also, the rabbis who were against Zionism in the 1800's were indeed fearful of  the secularism of most, but not all, of its founders. However, there were  three groups. Those opposed, those in favor and the majority, who were  silent, reserving judgement. Nowadays, there is only a small insignificant sect  who calls for the absolute dismantling of Israel - and even THEY claim to believe it should be done peacefully. The Jewish groups that tend to  support Arab violence against Israel, on the other hand, are EXACTLY those  leftists that you so despise! Getting confusing, isn't it?
[ IT IS TRUE THAT THE ORTHODOX JEWS HAVE NEARLY ALL BEEN CO-OPTED TO SUPPORT ZIONISM NOW. BUT WE SHALL SEE IF THIS WAS INDEED A SATANIC PLOT OR A G-D BLESSED PLOT. THE LAST CHAPTER IS NOT YET WRITTEN. ALSO, SINCE I AM VERY HOSTILE TO ISLAM I WOULD MORE GLADLY SUPPORT ISRAEL AS A BULWARK AGAINST ISLAM, BUT THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY OF THE LEFT-WING AMERICAN JEWS CONFUSES MY LOYALTIES. ]
Finally, I live in Israel, man. How would you feel if I said that it  should have been the "People's Republic" of Massachusetts (where I went to  school) that was hit by Bin Laden, killing thousands, just to "wake up the  liberals [ WELL IN RESPONSE TO WHAT YOU WROTE IN THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE, I MUST SAY THAT IF I WAS A JEW WHO LIVED IN ISRAEL, I WOULD BE A 100% MILITANT RIGHT-WINGER. I WOULD UTTERLY CRUSH ARAFAT AND I WOULD FORCIBLY REMOVE THE PALESTINIANS TO SYRIA, IRAQ, IRAN OR WHERE EVER AND I WOULD DO ALL OF THIS WITH NO APOLOGY. HOWEVER, IF I WAS A PALESTINIAN, I WOULD KILL AS MANY JEWS AS I COULD. I WOULD HATE THE JEWS AND REGARD THEM AS FOREIGN INVADERS WHO MUST BE REMOVED BY WHATEVER MEANS NECESSARY, INCLUDING TERRORISM. AS A CHRISTIAN, MY LOYALTIES NORMALLY WOULD GO FIRST TO SUPPORTING JEWS AGAINST ISLAM, BUT MY ANGER AT WHAT THE LEFT-WING JEWS ARE DOING TO AMERICA HAS ME SOMEWHAT FLUMOXED. ]
Incidentally, "messianic Jews" are an insult to Christianity and  Judaism. If you do respect Orthodox Judaism, you will respect that you cannot  combine true Judaism with true Christianity. There are anti-missionizing laws  on the books in Israel. That applies to Hare Krishna just as much as to Jews  for Jesus. No Christian in Israel is targeted because he is a Christian.  There are Christians (and other non-Jews) in all sectors of Israeli society  (incl. the army, the government, business). The claim of oppression of  Christians in Israel is just wrong (do you read Josef Farah? He is an Arab and a religious Christian - and pro-Israel. He edits WorldNetDaily.com).
[ REGARDING "MESSIANIC JEWS." THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE WAS WRITTEN BY JEWS. JESUS WAS A JEW. THE APOSTLE'S PAUL & PETER & JOHN & MARK & MATTHEW WERE ALL JEWS. CHRISTIANITY IS A JEWISH RELIGION. CHRISTIANITY WAS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY JEWISH IN IT'S EARLY YEARS - SO - YOU ARE WRONG TO SAY THAT "MESSIANIC JEWS" ARE AN INSULT TO CHRISTIANITY. THOSE ANTI-MISSIONIZING LAWS ARE EVIL AND BIGOTED UNLESS YOU ADVOCATE THAT EVERY NATION SHOULD BE ABLE TO WRITE LAWS FAVORING THE SELECTED "STATE" RELIGION. YOU SOUND LIKE THE TALIBAN WHEN YOU ADVOCATE SUPPORT FOR "ANTI-MISSIONIZING" LAWS. BTW, YES, I READ AND LOVE JOE FARAH. JOE IS PRO-ISRAEL, JUST LIKE ALL PROTESTANT CHRISTIANS IN AMERICA USED TO BE. I AM TRYING TO CHANGE THAT. I AM WORKING TO TURN CHRISTIANS AGAINST THE LEFT-WING JEWS IN AMERICA OUT OF A MOTIVE OF SELF-DEFENSE BECAUSE OF WHAT THESE JEWS ARE DOING TO US CHRISTIANS IN AMERICA. ]
That is why I say, stick to defeating liberal IDEAS - do not allow  yourself to be drawn by conspiracy theories that depend on a certain ethnic  group all working together to take over the world. What is true is that common problems lead to common solutions.
[ I AM ONLY FOCUSING ON THE JEWS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE LEADERS OF NEARLY ALL OF THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN GROUPS IN AMERICA. ]
Once you stop singling out Jews and start singling out wrong-headed,  liberal ideas alone, you might earn some respect from more right-wing Jews,  like myself. ---------- Nissan R.
[ STICK MY HEAD IN THE SAND AND PRETEND I DO NOT SEE WHAT THE LEFT-WING JEWS ARE DOING TO AMERICA... IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE TELLING ME TO DO? ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT I SHOULD NOT WRITE OR TALK ABOUT WHAT THESE LEFT-WING JEWS ARE DOING TO AMERICA? PS - YOU CLAIM TO BE RIGHT WING, BUT I SUSPECT YOU ARE IN FAVOR OF ABORTION RIGHTS, TOLERANCE OF HOMOSEXUALS AND PERHAPS EVEN SOME SOCIALISM SUCH AS SOCIALIZED MEDICINE OR SOCIAL SECURITY TYPE RETIREMENT PROGRAMS. TELL ME IT IS NOT TRUE. I AM BCC'NG THIS TO 150 PEOPLE ON MY PERSONAL EMAIL LIST. SHALOM, BOB FROM MICHIGAN.]

@_subject: IRS 'Missing' 2300 Laptops 
01/08/2002 - Updated 03:02 PM ET More than 2,300 IRS computers missing
WASHINGTON (AP)  The Internal Revenue Service, which holds taxpayers
strictly liable for accurate tax returns, is working to account for more
than 2,300 computers that have gone missing over the past three years.
   Tech Extras   Sign up for Techs free e-mail newsletter Search USA TODAY for earlier stories on this subject A recent Treasury Department audit was unable to determine whether the
laptops and other small computers were lost, stolen or simply not properly
documented. The IRS is reasonably sure that none contained sensitive
taxpayer data or could provide a way for hackers to break into the tax
agency's secure main computers.
IRS officials said Tuesday they are locating the computers, most of which
are older than three years and would normally be replaced anyway. Toni
Zimmerman, IRS chief of information technology services, said some were
probably stolen or lost but that most were misplaced through bookkeeping
"Over the course of events, they were coded wrong in the system,"
Zimmerman said.
Still, a senior senator suggested that Congress require concrete
improvements before approving more money for a long-term IRS computer
systems upgrade.
"An agency that requires taxpayers to show every receipt can't find 2,300
computers," said Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, ranking Republican on the
Senate Finance Committee. "The IRS wouldn't accept from a taxpayer the
nonanswer it has given."
In a letter dated Monday, Grassley asked Mitch Daniels, head of the White
House Office of Management and Budget, to consider placing a hold on the
IRS budget until the situation gets better. The IRS budget for fiscal 2002
is $9.5 billion, and Congress has approved over $391 million through 2004
for the computer modernization project.
The IRS got a positive opinion on its inventory controls last year from
the congressional General Accounting Office and is determined to get
better yet, Zimmerman said.
"We want to show that we are fiscally responsible and taxpayers should
feel confident with our processes," she said.
The missing computers were uncovered by a Treasury inspector general
during an audit late last year that also found six unaccounted-for IRS
firearms and hundreds of lost investigative items such as badges and
communications gear.
All told, auditors could not account for 2,332 laptops, microcomputers and
microservers covering the period between October 1998 and Sept. 30, 2001.
The IRS had 163,000 computers total as of September.
IRS officials said they are working on a new system allowing the agency to
discern between computers that are lost, stolen or damaged and improve its
ability to investigate incidents of missing property.
Of the six missing guns, one was lost in an ocean boating accident and
five were stolen from vehicles. Fifty communications devices, 40
identification badges and 15 pieces of electronic surveillance gear were
also reported missing, which auditors said "could compromise the public's
safety or ongoing investigations."

@_subject: U.S. Rep. positions against copy controls 
(sent again - original message did not get through)
WASHINGTON--A U.S. congressman said Monday that he intended to change a
controversial copyright law to allow consumers to override technologies that
prevent them from making digital copies of music, movies and software. Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., said he plans to introduce a bill that would
eliminate the "anti-circumvention" clause of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (DMCA), a 1998 law that updated copyright laws for the digital
era. Intended to discourage piracy, the clause has come under increasing fire
over the past year by people who say it imposes severe limits on the rights
of consumers to make personal backup copies or otherwise control music they
have purchased. The clause has inspired high-profile court battles and made
a minor celebrity out of Dmitry Sklyarov, the Russian programmer jailed for
writing a program that defeated a copy-protection measure in Adobe Systems'
eBook software. Boucher told an audience of musicians, lawyers and music industry executives
at the Future of Music policy summit that his bill would modify section 1201
of the DMCA to allow consumers to defeat copy-protection measures for
legitimate personal uses, but it would still outlaw circumvention efforts
for piracy. "I'm very concerned about the DMCA," Boucher said. "There's an increasing
number of instances in which unjust results are reached." On Monday, Boucher pointed out that Vivendi Universal's Universal Music
Group will soon release its new CDs in copy-protected form, making them
impossible to play on personal computers and some CD systems as well. Consumers should be able to use computer programs to defeat that copy
protection, he said. Other interesting opinions of Rick Boucher can be on his website at:

Reply-To: Conspiracy Theory Research List Israel Kills Palestinian Boys, Steals Organs For Transplants
Teheran Times.com
AL-KHALIL (IRNA) - The Zionist state has tacitly admitted that doctors at the Israeli forensic institute at Abu Kabir had extracted the vital organs of three Palestinian teenage children killed by the Israeli Army nearly ten days ago.   Zionist Minister of Health Nessim Dahhan said in response to a question by Arab member of the Zionist Parliament 'Knesset', Ahmed Teibi, on Tuesday that he couldn't deny that organs of Palestinian youths and children killed by the Israeli forces were taken out for transplants or scientific research.   "I couldn't say for sure that something like that (taking out the organs) didn't happen."   Teibi said he had received credible evidence proving that Israeli doctors at the forensic institute extracted such vital organs as the heart, kidneys, and liver from the bodies of Palestinian youths and children killed by the Israeli Army in Gaza and the West Bank.   The Israeli authorities normally detain the bodies of martyred Palestinians for a few days without any explanation.   The Israeli Army on December 30 killed three Palestinian boys, aged 14-15 near Khan Younis in unclear circumstances.   The army issued conflicting reports on the killing, while Palestinian sources charged that Israeli troops murdered the three unarmed boys in cold blood.   The bodies of the three boys were handed over to the Palestinians for burial on 6 January.   However, shortly before burial, Palestinian medical authorities examined the bodies and found out that the main vital organs were missing from the bodies. The Israeli media have nearly completely ignored the affair.   (IRNA)

Labour MPs protest as CIA gets power to snoop on any house in Britain
By Severin Carrell
13 January 2002
The CIA has recruited British defence and hi-tech companies in an attempt to
acquire the latest technology for its spying missions and
The British firms, including the mobile-phone company Hutchison 3G and
aerospace contractor BAE Systems, are helping the CIA to develop
sophisticated map reading, 3-D mapping and computer communications
In conflicts such as the war in Afghanistan, these projects would
potentially allow CIA agents in the war zone to translate an obscure
reference to a building, village or cave into a 3-D photo-realistic map of
the area via laptops and satellite phones.
One project funded by the CIA uses raw data provided by the Ordnance Survey
based on its digital maps of the UK, sparking criticism from MPs.
One Labour MP said the projects raised major questions about whether these
relationships were in Britain's interests. Alan Simpson, a senior member of
the left-wing Campaign group of backbenchers, said: "Where does this take
the CIA? If we're giving them the ability to plot grid references to any
house in Britain, it raises fundamental questions about whether this is in
the national interest."
The CIA, the world's largest and most powerful intelligence agency, has been
under immense pressure to catch up with the rapid developments and spread of
computer and internet technology over the past decade. Its directors admit
that the size and reach of the internet has left it struggling to catch up.
In 1999, it set up a unique private company called In-Q-Tel to invest about
$30m a year in hi-tech companies and research projects.
"We make investments in companies where we have a strategic interest in the
technology," a spokeswoman said.
Five British firms have become collaborators or contractors for In-Q-Tel
through a US-dominated alliance of more than 220 private companies,
government agencies and universities called the Open GIS Consortium (OGC) to
develop common technological standards for computers.
In one project overseen by OGC, Hutchison 3G is a partner with In-Q-Tel and
five US firms to design a system which allows wireless links between
computers. The mobile-phone company Vodaphone is a contractor and the
British companies Laser-Scan and its owner, Yeoman Group, have become
observers in the project.
In another project, In-Q-Tel has hired a division of BAE Systems and
Laser-Scan, which makes digital and internet maps, to develop ways of
linking geographical data from separate sources  a technique known as
inter-operability. This project uses Ordnance Survey data.
Laser-Scan is also involved with the Military Mapping Project, where the CIA
and US Army is developing further sophisticated 3-D mapping techniques, such
as sending them via the internet, in a restricted project also overseen by
British companies appear to have avoided the most controversial projects
funded by In-Q-Tel. One US firm called SafeWeb had been paid to give the CIA
the ability to snoop on internet web sites without being detected.
All the companies and agencies involved insisted the projects were above
board, and Ordnance Survey stressed that its data was used simply for
research purposes.
In-Q-Tel denied that it required its contractors to sign secrecy deals with
the CIA, or expected to control the results of its projects with OGC.

Representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Israeli Shin

Los Alamos Scientist Criticizes FBI in Book
Lee Calls Copied Tapes 'Crown Junk'
By Walter Pincus
Washington Post Staff Writer
Wednesday, January 16, 2002; Page A08
Former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee maintains he was selected for
prosecution because of his ethnic background and asserts that the computer
tapes he downloaded, which were the basis of his guilty plea, were not the
"crown jewels" of nuclear weapons building, but "largely the crown junk."
In his newly published autobiography, "My Country Versus Me," written with
the help of Helen Zia, Lee acknowledges that his downloading of computer
tapes was a security violation. But he blames the multi-year FBI
investigation of his activities and his jailing in solitary confinement for
nine months on espionage charges partly on Washington hysteria and spineless
Most of all, the Taiwan-born Lee writes, "Had I not been Chinese, I never
would have been accused of espionage and threatened with execution."
Lee's book, however, does not totally explain why he downloaded computer
codes associated with nuclear weapons designs in 1993-94, and again in 1997.
In fact, he focuses his attention on the earlier download and not at all on
those of 1997.
As he did in earlier interviews, he said in his book that the downloading in
the 1993-94 period was done "to protect my files, to make a backup copy." He
adds, as he did just before his guilty plea to the surprise of his own
lawyers, that he had "made more than one backup copy, actually." Why more
than one backup? Because, he writes, "there were no lab rules against making
copies -- most prudent people keep copies of their important documents."
He also said he had "lost some important codes before, when the [Los Alamos
computer] operating system changed, and I didn't want that to happen again."
But, as Los Alamos senior scientists testified at Lee's trial, and another
newly published book on the Lee case, "A Convenient Spy," repeats, Los
Alamos scientists in the highly classified X Division where Lee worked were
repeatedly offered opportunities to copy their own work in case of computer
failure, "day by day, even computer stroke by computer stroke," one said
Reporters Dan Stober and Ian Hoffman provide another reason for Lee's
downloading. He might have wanted to use the data in a future job, either
with a Taiwan company called Asiatek, which has close ties to that country's
defense ministry, or some other company.
As for the computer codes themselves, called the "crown jewels" of the
nuclear weapons business by one of the nuclear lab's senior scientists, Lee
called them "the crown junk" and "the biggest nuclear weapons secret that
[Los Alamos National Laboratory] and the government have to hide.
"The cornerstone of nuclear deterrence," Lee writes, "is to scare the rest
of the world into thinking that our weapons are bigger, stronger, faster,
and far more destructive than theirs." And while saying that statement is
true, Lee goes on to say, "the science of nuclear weapons hasn't progressed
much" since the end of the Cold War and the test ban treaty.
He says scientists like himself still at the U.S. weapons labs "spend their
time figuring out what to do with rusty, old nuclear bombs." The stockpile
stewardship program, "fixing old bombs and digging up old test data" in
trying to keep U.S. nuclear weapons safe and reliable, is "like eating
leftovers for dinner, [but] it's better than nothing."
Much of the preliminary testimony and motions in court went Lee's way,
particularly because of the work of his two lead lawyers, John Cline and
Mark Holscher.
But when the decision came before trial to accept an agreement that included
pleading guilty to one count of mishandling classified information, Lee
writes that Cline and Holscher told him he had a 95 percent chance of
winning "if it goes to trial, but a five percent chance that we could lose.
If we lose, you could face life in prison. Are you willing to take that
Saying "it was not worth the risk of spending the rest of my life in
prison," Lee said he agreed, since losing the right to vote, own a gun, run
for public office or serve on a jury was "less of a sacrifice . . . than to
risk a prison sentence."

Sadly true. While some people actually get real information and form their
own opinions, the majority simply repeat the bulk feed straight from the
TV. Government controlled information and Hollywood movies provide the
justification for any atrocity the US military sees fit to commit.
All it takes is a nice Hollywood movie about the subject to get the
president's popularity polls stay high, and all is well in the capitol.
Still, does that make all the violence justified and allright? If anyone on this planet is a master for 'creating plausible deniability
for violent action' and justification of their own brutality and acts of
mass murder, it is the US military and political system. Double standards
*is* the American Way of doing foreign policy.
Public 'perception management' is a military science nowadays. See 'Puppet Master' in Air Force 2015 somewhere under Heh. I used to think the same about American foreign policies,
but they consider 1.5 million dead Iraqi women and children 'worth the price' for what they got.
Value is a biased concept. Double standards apply. In general,
Americans see no value in the lives or human rights of non-Americans.
They don't seek the 'good of all', or 'equal justice' on this planet.
They seek money for themselves. Each individually and as groups and
entities. Indeed, money is the only significant political motive
Americans are capable of having. Someone in the chain of command is
motivated by money and power, or things would not be happening the way
they do.
Expressing 'violent sentiments' is equal to 'passing wind', in my book.
Freedom of speech and opionion should be respected. (Read: At least those of Americans, if you are an American.) What we should be worrying
of, instead, is people not saying anything even when people are being
slaughtered and starved to death. What I want is the government to start respecting the lives and rights of
non-Americans equally in their foreign policy. Is that too much to ask? The respect you can afford to give, is the respect you can expect to get.
Right now, Americans don't seem to afford much.

@_subject: USA: Arbitrary, discriminatory, cruel, futile --  25 years of judicial 
Reply-To: owner-amnesty-l
* News Release Issued by the International Secretariat of Amnesty
International *
17 January 2002
AMR 51/007/2002
A quarter of a century of executions in the USA has offered no
constructive contribution to the country's efforts to combat
violent crime and has caused serious damage to its international
reputation, Amnesty International said today as it issued a new
report to mark the 25th anniversary of the resumption of
executions in the United States.
The report, "Arbitrary, discriminatory, and cruel: An
aide-mémoire to 25 years of judicial killing", recalls some 200
illustrative cases of the men and women put to death since Gary
Gilmore was shot by a Utah firing squad on the morning of 17
January 1977 -- the first execution after the US Supreme Court
lifted the moratorium it had imposed on the death penalty in
"The USA likes to see itself as a champion of human rights,"
Amnesty International said. "However, its relentless pursuit of
the death penalty in an increasingly abolitionist world starkly
gives the lie to that claim."
"In a period that has seen more than 60 countries legislate
against the death penalty, the USA has shot, gassed,
electrocuted, hanged or poisoned more than 750 prisoners, 600 of
them since 1990," the organization continued.  "What is more, it
has frequently violated internationally-agreed safeguards in
getting the individual to the execution chamber.
"We urge US politicians to answer the question -- what measurable
benefit to society have these killings achieved?," stated Amnesty
International, whose report provides cases to illustrate the
cruelty, futility and brutalizing effect of capital punishment as
well as its rejection of the possibility of rehabilitation.
The report gives examples of the arbitrary way in which the death
penalty is applied in the USA, its politicized nature, and the
fact that this is a punishment that diverts attention and
resources from constructive responses to violent crime.
The report points to numerous cases of people put to death since
1977, including:

Dershowitz: Make Torture An Option
* Civil Libertarian Believes Torture Will Be Used In War On Terrorism
* And He Wants Specific Procedures In Place
* Watch Sunday at 7 PM ET/PT
(CBS) Is there a place in the U.S. justice system for torture?
Alan Dershowitz, the civil libertarian defender of O. J. Simpson,
believes the law should sanction torture so it may be applied
in certain cases, such as terrorist acts.
In a report to be broadcast Sunday on 60 Minutes, Dershowitz tells
Correspondent Mike Wallace that torture is inevitable. "We cant just
close our eyes and pretend we live in a pure world," he says.
After the events of Sept. 11, with many al Qaida members in custody,
Dershowitz says he wants to bring the debate to the forefront. He gave
the "ticking bomb" scenario - a person refusing to tell when and where
a bomb will go off as an example of the type of case warranting torture.
The FBI has anonymously leaked to the press the belief inside the bureau
that torture may be an option in these trying times.  But Lewis Schiliro,
former New York bureau director, warns of problems with torture.
"If anybody had the ability to prevent the events of Sept. 11... they
would have gone to whatever length... The problem becomes, where do
we draw that line?" he tells Wallace.
Torture is prohibited by the U.S. Constitution, says Human Rights Watch
Executive Director Kenneth Roth, who also says its not reliable. He points
out that an Islamic terrorist, convicted in America for terrorist plots
he admitted to after torture by authorities in the Philippines, had also
admitted to being the Oklahoma City bomber.
"People will say anything under torture," says Roth, adding that
resorting to torture degrades humanity and the idea of democracy.
"We, in many important respects, become like the terrorists," he tells
Wallace.  "They will have won. Our democracy will have lost."
This is a naive viewpoint, says Dershowitz. "If anybody has any doubt that
our CIA, over time, has taught people to torture, has encouraged torture,
has probably itself tortured in extreme cases, I have a bridge to sell you
in Brooklyn."

@_subject: [InTheShadows] THE TRUTH (fwd) 
Reply-To: InTheShadows
The Truth
These are some basic truths about our society today. Look around, see for
yourself. I am not going to be sidetracked into the wasted effort of
``proving'' these things here for people who will not listen anyway [but
please see the additional reading section]. Listen to me, listen to the
press, listen to the government. Who do you believe?
1. The United States Government tortures its own citizens. We go around the
world talking about human rights, but agents of the U.S. government have not
hesitated to commit the most vicious crimes against humanity right here at
home. The political reality is that the U.S. is the leading economic and
political power in the world, and the only superpower. Thus the U.S.
government can maintain its pious hypocritical stance without fear of
``serious'' exposure. Our government has grossly abused its current power.
It has wasted a chance to be a world role model for ethical government, and
the chance likely will never come again.
2. The U.S. Constitution is just a piece of paper to covert thugs. The only
rights you have are the ones you can enforce. Here in the land of High Noon,
despite all the talk to the contrary, it is every man for himself. There are
plenty of people who would love to see you literally tortured if you differ
from them on the most minor political points. We lead the world in the
technology of warfare and espionage. The same technology is used to suppress
and harass so-called dissidents or ``threatening'' people and movements. If
you cannot prove it happened, and the weapons officially do not exist, then
nothing really happened, did it?
3. ``Freedom'' is an empty concept used for social control. You are free
only to the extent that you do not, for any reason, step on the toes of any
``important'' people. You may not even know what you have done, and may
never find out: The repressive machinery will kick into gear and your life
will be ruined. You may even come to realize that a campaign of dirty tricks
is being focused on you, but no one will believe you. Most people live
boring (to others) lives that do not threaten the powerful, and therefore do
not draw the attention of the repressive apparatus. Thus the myth of freedom
is perpetuated, while you are labeled a paranoid kook. The rhetoric of
freedom is at least useful in that it forces the repression into covert
channels. That is why I can openly post this list.
4. The elite and powerful in the U.S. are effectively immune to law. The law
is a tool to serve the ends of the powerful. Selective enforcement is the
norm. Of course, the powerful have their own sets of laws they use to attack
each other. Bad policies, based on misguided notions and a patronizing,
pseudo-moralizing paternalism, produce disastrous consequences. Politicians
cynically exploit the resulting suffering to maintain their positions of
power, reinforcing the misguided policies. Police on the street end up
paying the price, bearing the brunt of enforcing bad laws.
5. The elite opinion-makers are not nearly as smart as they think they are.
Their insular debates are frequently characterized by ignorance and outright
stupidity. This tendency is heavily abetted by a forced conformity of
belief. The price of mounting too strong a challenge to a ``politically
powerful'' idea is ostracism and ridicule by their peers. Soon, testing
ideas for political viability or against projected poll results becomes a
substitute for critical thinking.
6. The mainstream press will not challenge -- and at times participates
in -- outrageous governmental abuses. Watergate and the investigations of
intelligence abuses in the mid-'70s were historical rarities. The press
routinely cooperates in a conspiracy of silence -- even when innocent
American lives are being destroyed and hideous crimes are being committed.
The investigations of intelligence abuses in the '70s were also not
especially effective. The investigators were completely outclassed by a
group of professional liars, trained to subvert governments worldwide. The
Cold War was still on, giving additional clout to the apologists for
domestic crimes committed by our own forces. The ``intelligence community''
is well aware of the limited attention span of the American press, and
repeatedly and effectively uses stonewalling, or worse, to escape any
responsibility or accountability for its actions. The reforms of the '70s
were subsequently largely reversed. We need a sustained, nonpartisan
political consensus to clean out our nation's dirty secrets, give the
domestic victims redress, punish the Cold War criminals, and start fresh
without the baggage of secret, unacknowledged atrocities.
7. The ``ruling class'' elites typically respond positively only to the
threat of losing their privileged positions or of violence. That is just how
it is. It often takes a riot or other violent actions to even draw their
passing notice. But then this violence -- often caused by their shameful
neglect of gross injustice and intolerable conditions -- is used to justify
increasing police and secret police powers. In their insulated cocoons, the
elites pretend not to hear the cries of the disenfranchised -- after all,
things like that do not happen in their neighborhoods. By definition, those
people must have done something to deserve it.
8. There need not be any official, organized conspiracy. Conspiracies do
occur regularly -- they have throughout history, and our time is no
exception. But, for the individuals who are victimized by the system, it
does not matter if it is an organized unit following orders or a system of
well-understood winks and nods. Rule of law is clearly a joke in the U.S.
9. They blame it on ``rogues'' if they are caught, but knowledge goes
straight up to the top. Even where some actions truly are the results of
rogue agents, the coverups go straight to the top. Purposeful ignorance to
maintain ``plausible deniability'' is no excuse or escape from culpability.
The buck never stops...
10. The U.S. government is not the United States or America. Most Americans
are decent people who would be appalled to know the dirty tricks their
government carries out in their names. Unable or unwilling to accept the
ruthless amorality of the power-hungry, they tend to believe whatever lies
are sent their way. And unfortunately, as in any society, a significant
minority of Americans are simply fascists. Excessive government secrecy has
even destroyed the democratic accountability of our leaders to the people:
Politicians can engage in, approve of, or willfully ignore covert
operations, knowing their actions will never be revealed to the public.
Amazingly, some members of Congressional intelligence committees are ``not
cleared'' to even know details of the programs they must vote on. (These are
our elected representatives being dictated to by a permanent, secret
bureaucracy.) The public will never go to the voting booths knowing which of
their leaders participated in domestic spying, political surveillance, and
outright torture.
Links for Further Reading.
Some Final Words
These sorts of problems are not anything new in history. The weapons have
changed, and the years have advanced, but human nature remains the same. Our
institutions have ``learned'' only very slowly over this time. This does not
mean we should simply pretend to be civilized while ignoring the barbarism
around us. Especially when our government and basic principles of governance
are at issue.
In this age of steadily advancing technology and surveillance capabilities
it is increasingly important that our laws be fair, rational, and uniformly
enforced. Technology will transform our society. We must work to ensure that
it transforms us for the better, because it can also be used to create a
police state such as the world has never seen. That may sound extreme, but
it is the simple truth -- and one we do not want to discover too late.

I believe we should stop talk about "traditional balance of copyright", because it is injurious illusion. There have never been such a balance, and the problem is as follows: ALL copyright related laws mix up author and copyright holder.  It was not  apprehended by public so far, because have not created that much tension until Internet involvement.
Copyright holder in fact is the same as a publisher (in general terms), and is just a business entity, which tries to exploit author (it works even in those cases when author and publisher is the same person). Author, generally speaking, does not depend on businessman in order to create. Author is the only one,who needs protection. And the only danger he or she needs to be protected from is a publisher, which intents to still name.
One of the most powerful forces, which encourage creativity is an audience. This means that  ANY limitation on distribution of any idea, art work, invention, music, article, etc. causes damage to public.
Thus ANY copyright related law or action, which, generally speaking, implements some limitations on ideas' distribution, definitely harms public.
So called "copyright balance"  protects ONLY certain business models.
The question is, why any business model should be protected on expense of the public interest?
I can understand necessity to protect market, industry, science, culture, technology, etc. development. But this does not imply protection of certain business models. It seems to be obvious: if a business model contradicts market and, general society development then such model should not be protected. But we must talk not only about protection of society. We must think how to enforce its development. And one easy answer for this question does exist:
music, inventions, etc.
Do you need examples, how this worked in the history of mankind?
Find them yourself! Do not pass by WWW, Internet, Linux, radio, telephone, automobile, book printing, ...wheel.
Do you need examples, how copyright law harmed author, slowed down industry, technology, culture development?
Do not ask me. Find them!
Forget about business models, which do not comply with FREE circulation of ideas. There are another models on the market and they work.
One can say, if we remove all copyright limitations, the material interest of an author will be compromised.  Let us think about this problem then. I can imagine some kind of special taxes for use of a new idea, special public funds to compensate author work... This must be elaborated.
I personally believe that there is no place for a compromise in these matters.  We must find such a mechanisms, which would serve to the best SOCIETY AND AUTHOR interest!
World Wide Web grew up on ground of complete freedom of circulation of ideas. I think it happened because WWW gave in set of tools for everyone to create and communicate. These capabilities, I believe, are the very fundamental for human being. There are millions of people, who act in this arena and are happy to do so.
On the other hand, when job was done by public, and powerful productive nature of WWW was uncovered, money hunters woke up and try to control it, using their business models.
That is how the great tension of our time develops. That is why so many people try to understand, what is going on, and how to protect...
But who must be protected?
I hope, it will eventually  become clear for majority that the problem is not, how to protect revenues of some nearsighted corporations. The only problem is the very idea of intellectual property.  This is a monster, which causes more and more troubles and will cause more and more... That is why  for me all talks about possible positive side effects of THE COMPLETELY WRONG IDEA of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY sound like talks about positive side effects of murder.
This hurts. Freedom cannot slow down "making of new works".  I will be very surprised to meet a single person who will not write a book, or article, or music, or will stop to think about new engineering idea because of  lack copyright protection.  An author, normally, is afraid of just one thing: stealing of the name. There is nothing to do here with a publisher fear, because this one is about money. The illusion that copyright  encourages creativity is the actual problem. Copyright works against creativity, because gives tools in hands of publisher to control author.
This hurts.  There is no such-like problems: how technical and law protection should cooperate. All attempts to state and solve those problems cause the ONE REAL PROBLEM: limitation of freedom of communication and The other side of this medal is enforcement of business models, which exploited limitations of freedom. Why should we think about this? I do not congratulate us for such-like "science". I would prefer to talk about real This hurts.  "Rightholders" complain that public attempts to protect very basic right and need of human being, and scientists think how to slightly limit those complaints.  May I state this one more and last time? Those twisted complaints are normal developments of the idea of intellectual property.  People have right to protect their property. The problem is that there is no such a thing in cultural fields: property. Finish.

Reply-To: ukcrypto
There's the UK Campaign for Digital Rights (
and other small groups, as well as, I believe, EBLIDA (librarians), who
probably aren't small, but aren't focused on this particular issue.  UK
CDR is more about being against the European Copyright Directive and
defending the status quo on copyright (see the quote from me in the
Register article at the beginning of this thread), rather than having a
positive programme of its own.
The problem is as follows: the traditional balance of copyright is being
upset by the massively reduced cost of infringement, and the efforts of
rightholders to increase the protection the State gives them. The former
is being used to justify the latter, but the legislative scrutiny to which
the latter is being submitted is insufficient to strike a new balance in
which the public interest is best served.
Personally, I believe that the Internet constitutes a qualitatively new
environment, and that a new set of compromises will have to be reached,
which may include the legal protection for technological protection
measures (TPMs).
It seems to me, though I know little of this area, being more of a UNIX
sysadmin type than a security specialist, that TPMs cannot in principle
perfectly protect information goods, but that they can significantly
increase the cost of certain acts to the point where they are an
economically feasible way of protecting `content'. If the law is to
protect such measures, it ought to do it in a way calculated to maximise
the benefit to the public; too much or too little legal protection to
information works themselves hurts the public (either too few people will
*make* new works, or too few people can *use* them), and the same applies
to legal protection for TPMs. There are four major limits on copyright: duration of term, scope of works
which may be covered, fair use/dealing, exhaustion/first sale. The
contours of the law in these areas can in some cases only be determined by
the courts; there's no programmatic way (I assert) that the creator of a
TPM to be used by a rightholder (or even to be used by a pirate) can
express the whole of copyright law to ensure that the TPM operates the way
that copyright law would; we should expect a competent and rational
TPM-creator to create a TPM system which furthered his interests, which
could be maximising his profits at the expense of the public through
circumventing copyright law, or the prevention of the detection and
punishment of piracy, or an attempt at reproducing the balance in
copyright law.
The law should not, as it seems to do in the UK, protect the intentions of
TPM creators, whether or not those intentions are conformant with public
policy (on copyright and competition and suchlike). It should limit its
protection to such TPM systems as are conformant with public policy.
The EUCD and DMCA attempt to do this, but they don't go nearly far enough,
and the danger is that rightholders will act in reliance on their extra
protection and complain when the public tries to get the extra protection
taken away.
Anyone who's got time to help me research this stuff please contact me; I
work three days a week as it is to allow me time to read up on copyright
law and related topics, and a helping hand would be most welcome.

@_subject: Looking back ten years: Another Cypherpunks failure (fwd) 
And Open Source failure, I might add...
---------- Forwarded message ----------
We know that some kind of privacy-enhanced payment system has been one
of the long-time c'punk goals, probably for at least ten years.  We
know that we are probably further away from having that be a reality
than we were ten years ago.  This is excusable; the obstacles are
enormous.  You need a lot of people to use it before it's useful, and
there are all kinds of regulatory problems.  And there are a whole
list of other problems, too.
One of the other c'punk goals was encryption all over the place.
Seems reasonable, right?  This Internet thing was just starting to
take off.  Free open-source OSes like Linux were coming out.
Encryption everywhere was well within reach.
And guess what, that goal was _almost_ achieved, except in two places,
which I am calling the Great Encryption Tabboos (GETs).
GET  is voice encryption over phone lines.  Three years after
Starium started, and ten years after c'punks started, you still can't
buy a digital voice encryption device that has trustable crypto in
it.  This is also excusable because it encounters some of the same
problems that privacy-enhanced payments encounter, namely overcoming
network effects and dealing with regulators.
GET  is disk encryption.  Yes, it sounds so simple, but it is a
Great Tabboo, and this time there are no excuses.  None.  You don't
need any network effects.  Regulators in the US have little they can
do about it.  There are about half a dozen great Open Source OSes to
work on.  And yet there is nothing.
Let me refine my definition of nothing.  Yes, I am well aware of
various kludges like Loopback Crypto on Linux, and CFS and TCFS and
StegFS.  But what about just plain old ext2 FS or ffs?  After all
these years, why is it that Microsoft is shipping OSes with FS crypto
before any of the free OSes are?  As far as I know, there is not a
single distribution of Linux or *BSD that ships with a non-kludge (ie,
non-loopback) encrypted FS.
I'm defining loopback as a kludge.  Unix FSes come with all kinds of
features such as file ownership and modes which don't require loopback
to work.  Encryption isn't any different from those features and it
should also be built in to the FS, not kludged on with a loopback.
Would you think it is a kludge if you read the docs on "chmod" and it
said, "oh, if you want to use chmod you're going to have to create
this loopback fs like this..."
So, is there any hope for having an open source OS ship with a
filesystem with encryption capabilities?

By James K. Galbraith James K. Galbraith, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, is
the author, most recently, of "Inequality and Industrial Change: A Global
January 25, 2002
NOWADAYS there are three classes in America: working people at the bottom,
professionals above them, a tiny elite at the top. Democrats represent the
professionals, Republicans represent the CEOs. No one, much, speaks for
working people, who must rely on the sympathy of leading Democrats for
most of the little they get.
Our politics accordingly mirrors corporate life, with an opposition out of
"Dilbert," grumpy but ineffective. Thus, after the 2000 election,
Democrats abandoned the black voters of Florida, who were disenfranchised
by the tens of thousands. In the tax-bill looting that followed in
Congress, there was just enough grease for the upper middle to buy its
silence. Meanwhile, raids on job safety, on the public schools, on unions,
and the attempt to demolish Social Security fell on the lower orders. In
each case, the aim was elite enrichment, amid the indifference of the
professional class.
Enron could change that. In details complex, the scandal is essentially
simple. A handful of rich people, closely tied to the Texas Republican
Party led by Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. Phil Gramm, decided to become
richer still. Their grand strategy included deregulation of energy,
deregulation of derivatives (an arcane financial device), corrupt
accounting practices, overseas tax scams, U.S. diplomatic pressure
(delivered in 2001 by Dick Cheney himself, on India, where Enron had sold
a white elephant power plant). And then, as the game unwound, they sold
their own stock while freezing employee pension accounts. In the end, the
gang made off with more than a billion dollars, that we know of.
Enron's real business was politics. Energy deregulation helped create the
web of commodities in which Enron traded. Derivatives deregulation
(courtesy of Gramm and Rep. Richard Armey) shielded that market from
review. Consulting contracts to the auditors bought complicity; payments
from auditors to politicians fended off the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Enron paid for favors promptly: $100,000 to the Democrats in
1997 to push the Indians around, $25,000 to Texas Gov. Rick Perry one day
after Enron's Mexico chief got to run the Public Utilities Commission in
Texas. Wendy Gramm, who chaired Enron's audit committee, got nearly $2
million. We still don't know exactly what Enron contributed, in
intellectual terms, to Cheney's energy policy, or to Treasury Secretary
Paul O'Neill's defense of overseas tax shelters. But it paid well for it:
over time, the big boss George Bush got more than $600,000 in Enron cash.
That we know of.
Enron reveals, for the first time, just how rot at the top can cut against
professional interests. Those were not only small fry, but modest
millionaires in some cases, who lost their 401(k)s. A professional's
pension can't be replaced. And there is nothing a hardworking middle
manager fears more than to end up on Social Security like ordinary folk.
Administration officials proudly refused to intervene on Enron's behalf
once bankruptcy loomed. But here's the catch: They weren't asked to. By
then, their friends had already cashed out. Saving the professionals, or
the company, was not on the agenda.
White House economist Lawrence Lindsey (who'd gotten $50,000 as an Enron
adviser in 2000) reviewed the great bankruptcy's risks to the economy at
large. He concluded they were small; he may not be wrong. Most of the
direct damage landed on a few thousand people in Houston.
But we shouldn't be entirely sure. Corporate America runs on the
collaboration of professionals with the elites. In big and small ways,
managers, accountants, lawyers and engineers make the system work. In each
firm, they have to trust that the big boys are not stealing from them.
Through their pension funds, they control vast sums that they must also
entrust back to corporate America - through the stock market. Before 1988,
the professionals of Japan also felt that by working and saving, borrowing
and investing, everyone would get rich. The crash of that year taught
otherwise. The Japanese middle classes felt betrayed, because they were
betrayed. Their money, what was left of it, went back under the mattress,
where it remains. Japan has not recovered in 14 years.
Suppose that American professionals come to feel the same way? The
economist Thorstein Veblen, back in the days of Teapot Dome, wrote that
the revolution here would not be led by workers. Rather, revolution could
only come to America in the hands of technicians, "the General Staff of
the industrial system," a normally contented class, "harmless and docile,"
in ordinary times. The technicians however, held the real power. And they
might, someday, realize that the absentee landlords, the Vested Interests,
as he called them and their political lackeys, serve no productive
Enron just might start a chain of events that could, in time, prove Veblen

Just to echo Whit's two file encryption virtues (the laptop and

CFS (a Unix encrypting file system) back in 1991 primarily for my own use,
motivated by the realization that I have two conflicting requirements for
file storage.  I need to be sure that my files will be available, but at the
same time, for at least some of the files, it is also important that they be
kept confidential.
File availability is commonly addressed through replication and frequent,
regular backups.  Backups are hard to do right, but there are network
effects that make it beneficial for many users to share backup
infrastructure - this is the main reason I tolerate having my computers

over them I have, the less able I am to reliably destroy some piece of
information once it has been backed up, and the more likely it is that a
malicious or careless staff member (or employer) might compromise
Encryption fits the bill here because it allows me to separate the system
components that I trust for availability from those that I trust for
confidentiality.  In particular, I can manage the confidentiality
component myself - I select and manage the keys, and the encryption runs
on hardware that's under my direct control (my workstation, my laptop, etc)
and whose use is not ordinarily shared with other people.  Of course,
there's also an availability problem here - loss of the key means loss of
all the data encrypted with it - but key backup of individual files
is a much simpler problem than the general file backup problem, not least
of which because file encryption keys are created and changed only
infrequently and are small enough to write down and put in a safe place.
The most critical aspect of CFS's design was to make sure it didn't break
any of the underlying backup mechanisms.   This led naturally to a design
at the file system layer and interfaces - encrypted files were stored as
ordinary, named files, and when the plaintext of a file changed, only the
corresponding encrypted file would change.  This also led to a simple
userland loopback (via NFS) implementation, for which, I decided, any
inefficiency (particularly with respect to cache memory management) was
outweighed by portability.  In retrospect, I would do it the same again today
- if anything the efficiency issues are less important now than they were 11
years ago.
I managed to release the CFS code from AT&T as open source (under a BSD
style license), which is another story by itself.  Unfortunately, the
code is still in use by a lot of people today, despite showing obvious
signs of age (it was originally written on and for an early *86 laptop
running a version of Mach).  It will no longer compile and install on many
modern Unix variants, including Linux, without serious coaxing.  I don't
have the time or resources to maintain it, especially with all the
current platforms which seem to have gratuitous differences in so many
of the interfaces that this code uses.  I also made a number of embarassing
architectural decisions that make it difficult to integrate AES. and to
be brought up to modern standards the whole codebase really should have

remains the most portable encrypting file system for Unix today.  I
wish someone would re-write it.
I think the most valuable contribution of CFS at this point is to the
extent it influences other designs, for which I'd encourage people to
look at my 1993 ACM Security conference paper, "A cryptographic file system

Why we few criticize Israel
Is Sri Lanka Worth Criticism?
2/25/02 11:26:37 AM
Joe Sobran / (Old) National Review
Commentary -- Why we few criticize Israel
By JOSEPH SOBRAN
WASHINGTON - People sometimes ask me why I'm so critical of Israel, as if
I should be devoting more of my attention to Sri Lanka, or perhaps Zaire.
But the question is always a little nervous, as it wouldn't be if I were
writing equally often about Sri Lanka or Zaire.
I could understand this curiosity if some other small, remote country were
one of the world's four or five military powers; if it received a quarter
of our foreign aid; if it were constantly on our front pages; and if its
sympathizers regularly occupied much of the op-ed space of The New York
Times and other major newspapers. But there is only one country of whom
these things are true, and that is Israel.
Nobody thinks it's odd that there should be 20 columnists who are
apologists' for Israel; but apparently it is unfathomable that there
should be one or two who are critical of Israel.
But there's another reason that is both personal and professional. Israel
has a very powerful lobby in this country, with a highly accomplished
propaganda corps. And that lobby is not content with making the case for
Israel and putting fear into nearly all the politicians in Washington, who
are supposed to be representing the interests of the United States. It
also tries to shut up opposition in the free press.
I have felt its pressure. So have Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. So has
Patrick Buchanan. And a great many newspaper editors.
We still hear of the fear engendered by Joe McCarthy. But people talked
freely about that fear even 'at the height of Sen. McCarthy's career. I
believe that someday historians will look back with more wonder about the
quieter and more paralyzing fear engendered in our own era by domestic
Zionist power. The press was never afraid of Sen. McCarthy; it is very
much afraid of Israel's U.S. sympathizers.
One result is that the news we get from Israel is heavily self censored
and bowdlerized. The average American thinks of Israel as a "democratic"
country whose domestic troubles are due to unruly Arabs. Not one American
Christian in a hundred realizes that if he lived in Israel, he would be
the victim of official discrimination forced, like the Soviet Jew, to
carry an identification card effectively stigmatizing him.
If Israeli propaganda were true, there would be no need to Quash or
intimidate critics. The very act of trying to silence opposition is a kind
of confession in itself. Ring Lardner said it well: "'Shut up,' he
Is there no case to be made for Israel? Of course there is. I have made it
myself. I would make it again -- if Israel had not become a threat to
freedom of speech and ethical debate in this country. But when you risk
injury to your career in the U.S. by defending the interests of the U.S.,
something is seriously wrong. A proper parallel is not with Joe McCarthy,
who at least was trying to uphold America's position, but with the
publishing industry in New York during the 1930s, when a book critical of
the Soviet Union stood scant chance of seeing print.
Suppression is a good tactic, but a bad strategy. In the long run, the
truth has a way of seeping through. No matter how many clever excuses you
make for a Yitzhak Shamir, it's not a terribly good idea to have Americans
identifying Israel with Yitzhak Shamir. Israel was much better off when
Americans identified Israel with Abba Eban -- now in political exile for
his moderation.
And it isn't wise, in the long run, to make Americans afraid, in their own
country, to speak their minds about a foreign country. They will
eventually resent the colossal impudence of it. And the country on whose
behalf the suppression was enacted will bear the consequences.

From Wired News, available online at:
Beefed-Up Global Surveillance?  By Declan McCullagh  2:00 a.m. Feb. 20, 2002 PST WASHINGTON -- An addition to an international treaty could permit police
to cooperate more closely on intercepting and decrypting the
communications of suspected terrorists.
The Council of Europe, which includes nearly all European nations, is
meeting this week to prepare additions to a controversial "cybercrime"
treaty that would cover decoding terrorist messages. The United States,
Canada and Japan are non-voting members of the council.
Peter Csonka, the head of the Council of Europe's economic crime division,
said when the drafting process for the so-called Second Protocol is
complete, the document will address "how to identify, how to filter, and
how to trace communications between terrorists."
Details are scarce, and the Council of Europe has repeatedly refused to
elaborate. Csonka would not confirm or deny whether the Second Protocol
will advance limits on encryption technology, coordinate code-breaking
efforts among member nations, or increase electronic surveillance
performed against people linked to terrorism.
This week's closed-door meeting, reportedly taking place at the council's
headquarters in Strasbourg, France, includes representatives from the U.S.
Justice Department, which was one of the most enthusiastic backers of the
original treaty.
Privacy groups and civil libertarians have spent nearly two years
criticizing the existing cybercrime treaty, which is now awaiting
ratification by the legislatures of member nations. If the council plugs
additional surveillance powers into the treaty, opposition seems certain
to increase substantially.
In December, the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers asked the
Steering Committee on Crime Problems to draft the "Second Protocol to the
Convention on Cybercriminality to cover also terrorist messages and the
decoding thereof." That is scheduled to happen after an antiterrorism
working group completes its report by April 30, 2002.
This week's meeting is a preliminary one. After the drafting process
begins in earnest later this spring, the steering committee will prepare a
detailed proposal in June and send it back to the Council of Ministers by
the end of September, according to the Csonka.
The still-secret Second Protocol will be, as the name implies, the second
set of additions to the underlying treaty. Currently the Council of Europe
is busy working on the First Protocol, which criminalizes "hate speech"
and racist remarks and likely will run afoul of the First Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution.
Some observers predict the U.S. delegates to the Council of Europe will
not sign the First Protocol. But the underlying cybercrime treaty, without
the "hate speech" components, is likely to go to the U.S. Senate for a
"There is a group of experts working on the First Protocol. Once this
committee produces the First Protocol in June, then the steering committee
will consider giving terms of reference for a new committee," Csonka said.
"The second group of experts operate on terms of reference that will be
drafted by the European Steering Committee on Crime Problems."
Bryan Sierra, a spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department, confirmed that
his agency's computer crime section sent representatives to this week's
meeting on the Second Protocol but steadfastly refused to say what they
were doing.
"We're not at liberty to discuss our position or even what's going on,"
Sierra said. "We would prefer to talk about these matters with the people
we're meeting with instead of with reporters."
The French activist group Imaginons un Réseau Internet Solidaire obtained
a list of participants from a December 2001 meeting relating to the "hate
speech" protocol. The three U.S. representatives are: Jason Gull, a trial
attorney at the Justice Department; Kenneth Harris, the associate director
of the criminal division's Office of International Affairs; and Richard
Visek, an attorney in the State Department's law enforcement and
intelligence section.
"This shows that the cyber rights community was justified in its
opposition to the cybercrime treaty," David Sobel of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center said of the Second Protocol. "It is becoming
the vehicle for an ever-expanding list of invasive intergovernmental
Privacy groups have opposed the underlying treaty, which, according to the
Council of Europe, no countries have ratified so far. Among the
objections: Encouraging self-incrimination, no clear limits on police
eavesdropping powers and unwarranted traffic data collection and storage.
One industry representative who attended a meeting on the cybercrime
treaty at the Justice Department earlier this month said it was suprising
that the government attendees never mentioned the Second Protocol: "It was
interesting because it didn't come up. This was a clear opportunity to
have that discussion."
A foreign affairs officer at the U.S. State Department said the department
is monitoring the process, but hasn't taken a position on the Second
Protocol. The person referred calls to the Justice Department.

@_subject: OT: Pentagon Readies Efforts to Sway Sentiment Abroad 
(But related to earlier discussions and suggestions)
Pentagon Readies Efforts to Sway Sentiment Abroad Tue Feb 19, 9:00 AM ET By JAMES DAO and ERIC SCHMITT The New York Times WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 The Pentagon is developing plans to provide news items, possibly even false ones, to foreign media organizations as part of a new effort to influence public sentiment and policy makers in both friendly and unfriendly countries, military officials said. The plans, which have not received final approval from the Bush administration, have stirred opposition among some Pentagon officials who say they might undermine the credibility of information that is openly distributed by the Defense Department's public affairs The military has long engaged in information warfare against hostile nations for instance, by dropping leaflets and broadcasting messages into Afghanistan when it was still under Taliban rule.
But it recently created the Office of Strategic Influence, which is proposing to broaden that mission into allied nations in the Middle East, Asia and even Western Europe. The office would assume a role traditionally led by civilian agencies, mainly the State Department.
The small but well-financed Pentagon office, which was established shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, was a response to concerns in the administration that the United States was losing public support overseas for its war on terrorism, particularly in Islamic countries. As part of the effort to counter the pronouncements of the Taliban, Osama bin Laden and their supporters, the State Department has already hired a former advertising executive to run its public diplomacy office, and the White House has created a public information "war room" to coordinate the administration's daily message domestically and abroad.
Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, while broadly supportive of the new office, has not approved its specific proposals and has asked the Pentagon's top lawyer, William J. Haynes, to review them, senior Pentagon officials said.
Little information is available about the Office of Strategic Influence, and even many senior Pentagon officials and Congressional military aides say they know almost nothing about its purpose and plans. Its multimillion dollar budget, drawn from a $10 billion emergency supplement to the Pentagon budget authorized by Congress in October, has not been disclosed.
Headed by Brig. Gen. Simon P. Worden of the Air Force, the new office has begun circulating classified proposals calling for aggressive campaigns that use not only the foreign media and the Internet, but also covert operations.
The new office "rolls up all the instruments within D.O.D. to influence foreign audiences," its assistant for operations, Thomas A. Timmes, a former Army colonel and psychological operations officer, said at a recent conference, referring to the Department of Defense. "D.O.D. has not traditionally done these things."
One of the office's proposals calls for planting news items with foreign media organizations through outside concerns that might not have obvious ties to the Pentagon, officials familiar with the proposal said.
General Worden envisions a broad mission ranging from "black" campaigns that use disinformation and other covert activities to "white" public affairs that rely on truthful news releases, Pentagon officials said. "It goes from the blackest of black programs to the whitest of white," a senior Pentagon official said.
Another proposal involves sending journalists, civic leaders and foreign leaders e-mail messages that promote American views or attack unfriendly governments, officials said.
Asked if such e-mail would be identified as coming from the American military, a senior Pentagon official said that "the return address will probably be a dot-com, not a dot- mil," a reference to the military's Internet designation.
To help the new office, the Pentagon has hired the Rendon Group, a Washington-based international consulting firm run by John W. Rendon Jr., a former campaign aide to President Jimmy Carter. The firm, which is being paid about $100,000 a month, has done extensive work for the Central Intelligence Agency, the Kuwaiti royal family and the Iraqi National Congress, the opposition group seeking to oust President Saddam Hussein.
Officials at the Rendon Group say terms of their contract forbid them to talk about their Pentagon work. But the firm is well known for running propaganda campaigns in Arab countries, including one denouncing atrocities by Iraq during its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
The firm has been hired as the Bush administration appears to have united around the goal of ousting Mr. Hussein. "Saddam Hussein has a charm offensive going on, and we haven't done anything to counteract it," a senior military official said.
Proponents say the new Pentagon office will bring much-needed coordination to the military's efforts to influence views of the United States overseas, particularly as Washington broadens the war on terrorism beyond Afghanistan.
But the new office has also stirred a sharp debate in the Pentagon, where several senior officials have questioned whether its mission is too broad and possibly even illegal.
Those critics say they are disturbed that a single office might be authorized to use not only covert operations like computer network attacks, psychological activities and deception, but also the instruments and staff of the military's globe- spanning public affairs apparatus.
Mingling the more surreptitious activities with the work of traditional public affairs would undermine the Pentagon's credibility with the media, the public and governments around the world, critics "This breaks down the boundaries almost completely," a senior Pentagon official said.
Moreover, critics say, disinformation planted in foreign media organizations, like Reuters or Agence France-Presse, could end up being published or broadcast by American news organizations.
The Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency are barred by law from propaganda activities in the United States. In the mid-1970's, it was disclosed that some C.I.A. programs to plant false information in the foreign press had resulted in articles published by American news organizations.
Critics of the new Pentagon office also argue that governments allied with the United States are likely to object strongly to any attempts by the American military to influence media within their borders.
"Everybody understands using information operations to go after nonfriendlies," another senior Pentagon official said. "When people get uncomfortable is when people use the same tools and tactics on Victoria Clarke, the assistant secretary of defense for public information, declined to discuss details of the new office. But she acknowledged that its mission was being carefully reviewed by the "Clearly the U.S. needs to be as effective as possible in all our communications," she said. "What we're trying to do now is make clear the distinction and appropriateness of who does what."
General Worden, an astrophysicist who has specialized in space operations in his 27-year Air Force career, did not respond to several requests for an interview.
General Worden has close ties to his new boss, Douglas J. Feith, the under secretary of defense for policy, that date back to the Reagan administration, military officials said. The general's staff of about 15 people reports to the office of the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict, which is under Mr. The Office for Strategic Influence also coordinates its work with the White House's new counterterrorism office, run by Wayne A. Downing, a retired general who was head of the Special Operations command, which oversees the military's covert information operations.
Many administration officials worried that the United States was losing support in the Islamic world after American warplanes began bombing Afghanistan in October. Those concerns spurred the creation of the Office of Strategic Influence.
In an interview in November, Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, explained the Pentagon's desire to broaden its efforts to influence foreign audiences, saying: "Perhaps the most challenging piece of this is putting together what we call a strategic influence campaign quickly and with the right emphasis. That's everything from psychological operations to the public affairs piece to coordinating partners in this effort with us."
One of the military units assigned to carry out the policies of the Office of Strategic Influence is the Army's Psychological Operations Command. The command was involved in dropping millions of fliers and broadcasting scores of radio programs into Afghanistan encouraging Taliban and Al Qaeda soldiers to surrender. In the 1980's, Army "psyop" units, as they are known, broadcast radio and television programs into Nicaragua intended to undermine the Sandinista government. In the 1990's, they tried to encourage public support for American peacekeeping missions in the Balkans.
The Office of Strategic Influence will also oversee private companies that will be hired to help develop information programs and evaluate their effectiveness using the same techniques as American political campaigns, including scientific polling and focus groups, officials said. "O.S.I. still thinks the way to go is start a Defense Department Voice of America," a senior military official said. "When I get their briefings, it's scary."

WARREN'S WASHINGTON INTERNET DAILY
Tuesday, February 12, 2002                    Vol. 3, No. 29
WORLDWIDE DMCA applicability claimed by federal prosecutors
in Elcomsoft copyright case.  Internet said to make it
impossible to apply only within U.S.  (P. 1)
U.S. Prosecutors Claim DMCA Applies Around the Globe
SAN JOSE -- The Digital Millennium Copyright Act properly
applies to activity outside the U.S., federal prosecutors
said in their case against a Russian company charged with
selling software decrypting Adobe e-Books.  "A construction
of the DMCA that applied it only within the borders of the
United States would thwart Congress's intent to prevent
circumvention technology from being available," the San Jose
U.S. Attorney's Office told U.S. Dist. Judge Ronald Whyte in
papers filed late last week.  "The ease with which materials
can be moved around the Internet makes it impossible to
conceive of an effective DMCA statute that applied solely
within the United States."  That construction was Congress's
intent, as shown by its prohibition against importation of
certain technology, prosecutors argued.
Prosecutors said the judge didn't need to decide that issue,
however, because Elcomsoft was subject to prosecution for
conduct within the U.S.  The company offered its program
through a Chicago server, took payment through a Washington
state firm, sold the software to U.S. customers, promoted it
at a Las Vegas conference, sought U.S. copyright protection
and intended an effect in the U.S., they said.  Further, the
prosecution comports with international law as a reasonable
application of U.S. law in protection of the country''s
territoriality and nationality, the filing said.
Prosecutors also sought to rebut defense arguments that
Elcomsoft had been charged improperly with conspiracy in a
case involving only its programmer, Dmitry Sklyarov, who no
longer is charged, and no one outside the company.  The
indictment refers to unnamed co-conspirators.  The 9th U.S.
Appeals Court, San Francisco, and others recognize the
legitimacy of charging intracorporate conspiracies, the
prosecutors said.  Contrary statements in First (Boston) and
10th (Denver) Appeals Courts opinions cited by the defense
were merely dicta, prosecutors contend.
The extraterritoriality and conspiracy issues are set for
hearing March 4.  Prosecutors are scheduled to file within 2
weeks responses to challenges to DMCA''s constitutionality.

Comcast Admits To Spying on Customers
By Tim McDonald
Part of the NewsFactor Network
February 13, 2002
Stored data can be subpoenaed by law enforcement officials or by lawyers in
civil cases - and it can be stolen.
Cable Internet giant Comcast (Nasdaq: CMCSK) reportedly has begun tracking
the Web browsing habits of its customers, keeping records of every Web page
they visit. The company has roughly 1 million high-speed Internet customers.
The third largest cable TV company behind AT&T Cable and AOL Time Warner
(NYSE: AOL), Comcast admitted that it stores the Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses -- unique numeric Internet addresses assigned to subscribers --
along with the Internet address of every Web page subscribers visit.
Jeffrey Chester of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Digital Democracy,
a nonprofit watchdog group, called the tracking "incredibly aggressive."
"It's not a surprise they are tracking what people are doing, it's just the
tip of the iceberg," Chester told NewsFactor. "The next generation of
broadband services provided by Comcast and others allows for this kind of
tracking. The whole business model moving forward for cable and the
television industry generally is one which emulates the deeply personalized
e-commerce strategies."
Sensitive Information
Comcast also said it stores sensitive information, such as credit card
numbers and passwords, in a database managed by network infrastructure
specialist Inktomi (Nasdaq: INKT).
Stored data can be subpoenaed by law enforcement officials or lawyers in
civil cases -- and, as has been proven several times, it can be stolen.
For example, last week, a database with thousands of records involving
potential Comcast Business Communication Internet customers was found
exposed on the Web.
Comcast said the snooping was part of a technological overhaul launched to
save money, according to wire service reports. However, Inktomi, which sold
the technology to Comcast, asserted that Comcast was collecting more
information than was absolutely necessary for technological enhancements.
Leading Role
Comcast claimed the tracking is permitted in its service agreement with
subscribers and said it does not intend to infringe on the privacy of its
customers. The company would not say how long the information it collected
was stored.
A company spokesperson said that customers' Web browsing is being recorded
in Detroit, Michigan, and parts of Delaware and Virginia, and that such
tracking will spread across the United States by the end of this week.
"Personalized television is really the cornerstone of the plan Comcast and
others have for the convergence of television with the Internet in the
broadband online medium," Chester said. "So, technologies are being
deployed, strategies are being developed, investments are being made in
hardware and software and applications all across the board -- and Comcast
is playing the leading role in that regard."
Excuse for Privacy Erosion?
Some civil libertarian groups have openly expressed concern about the
erosion of online privacy in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist
The FBI has been particularly aggressive in rooting out online evidence,
serving ISPs with warrants under a 1978 antiterrorism law.
"The privacy debate has been placed on the back burner, conveniently for
companies like Comcast, because of the concern over security since September
11th," Chester said. "As this and other incidents will undoubtedly show, we
need strong consumer safeguards when it comes to cable broadband."
More Cities 'Digitized'
Comcast announced a fourth-quarter net loss of US$321 million, due mainly to
its costly effort to migrate customers from  the broadband Internet
service provider that recently filed for bankruptcy.
The company has said it plans to add more high-speed Internet customers and
is planning to spend $1.3 billion to get more cities "digitized."
Comcast made a winning bid of $72 billion for AT&T Broadband in December. If
the deal is approved by shareholders, the Federal Trade Commission and the
Federal Communications Commission, it will result in the largest cable ISP
in the United States, with 2.2 million high-speed Internet customers.
The combined company would be called AT&T Comcast Corp.

Stephen Shankland, CNET News.com
A new plan for tagging everything from computers to shampoo bottles could
make life more convenient, but it's got privacy advocates up in arms
Sun Microsystems has joined a program called Auto-ID to build wireless
digital identification tags into everything from razor blades to soup cans,
chief executive Scott McNealy said on Thursday.
The technology promises efficiency for manufacturers and convenience for
shoppers -- but potentially also headaches for those concerned about
McNealy and his colleagues at Sun have eagerly anticipated the day when
everything with a "digital heartbeat" -- cell phones, cars, microwave
ovens -- is attached to the Internet. Sun hopes to supply the mammoth
servers that will process all the information produced by these devices.
"I used to talk about everything with a digital or electric heartbeat" being
connected to the Internet, McNealy told financial analysts in a speech here
Thursday. "Now I'm talking about tomato cans, and I'm not making it up
anymore," he quipped.
Sun has joined the Auto-ID program at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, funded by Procter & Gamble, Gillette, Wal-Mart, Unilever, Tesco,
Target and other corporations.
"You put stuff in a grocery basket and just drive by (a detector)," McNealy
said, describing the idea. The detector reads what's in the basket, charges
a person's credit card and "tells the factory to restock the shelves",
McNealy said.
The goal of the Auto-ID program is to keep store shelves full, said Gillette
spokesman Steve Brayton. On any given afternoon, 8 percent of the items that
US shoppers are looking for are out of stock, he said. On Sunday, it goes up
to 11 percent.
In addition, the technology could help curb theft, Brayton said.
Wal-Mart is trying out the technology in a pilot project in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
"We think within two to three years you'll find some early adopters among
retail and manufacturing businesses," Brayton said. "We're looking at five
to 10 years to widespread use."
Privacy problems?
But building transponders into every sort of product could spark privacy
concerns, said David Holtzman, an Internet security researcher and former
Network Solutions chief technology officer.
People might not be comfortable walking around with items that identify
themselves as medication, condoms or pornography. They also might not be
comfortable with manufacturers tracking where products go after being
And "if legislators mandate mandatory tagging of things like firearms or
ammunition, we could get both the left and right wing pissed off", Holtzman
Keeping store shelves stocked or easing checkout isn't a big deal, Holtzman
said. But combining that product information with data about the individuals
buying those products could raise hackles.
"Any one piece of information" -- cell phone records, purchasing records,
car location -- "is not that damning or intrusive. But if you put them
together, you've got my life," Holtzman said. "It's very hard to hide things
when you have that level of analysis."
Even if these uses aren't what retailers and manufacturers have in mind,
technology has a way of creeping into other domains, Holtzman added.
Transponders for driving through electronic tollbooths started as a
convenience to drivers but now are used in combination with timing analysis
to send out speeding tickets, for example.
How it's done
Auto-ID uses passive tags that respond to a specific radio signal. A tiny
capacitor on the chip stores enough energy from the incoming signal to send
out a response. The tags only respond when near a special reader device.
The tags also have a miniature chip and enough memory to keep track of a
digital identity. The memory is 96 bits long, tiny by computer standards but
it provides a huge number of combinations of ones and zeros.
The technology is set up to identify more than 268 million manufacturers
with more than a million individual products each, an Auto-ID representative
The memory stores an electronic product code, or EPC, which is linked with
an Internet service called the Object Naming Service (ONS) that keeps track
of data for every EPC-labeled object. Researchers also are working on a
pared-down 64-bit version of EPC.
But the system is limited by the cost of making the tags, not to mention
installing the infrastructure to monitor the tags and process the
With existing technology, tags cost about 50 cents. That's not much
additional expense for a $1,000 computer, but it is for a $3.50 bottle of
Gillette expects the investment to pay off in the long run, though, and
Auto-ID researchers are examining ways to bring the cost of tags down to a
nickel apiece.

difficult but achievable," research director Sanjay Sarma wrote in a

They Want Their ID Chips Now By Julia Scheeres
Feb. 6, 2002
Meet the Jacobs family: Jeffrey, Leslie and their son, Derek. They're a
fairly typical American family, middle class and ambitious. The father is
a dentist, the mother is an account executive at an interior design
magazine and the 14-year-old son plays jazz and tinkers with computers in
his spare time.
But one thing may soon make the Jacobses stand out: They could become the
first family in the world to be implanted with microchips that contain
their personal information.  The chip in question, the VeriChip, is
similar to the biochips that have been used to identify pets and livestock
for years.
Made by Applied Digital Solutions (ADS), the VeriChip stores six lines of
text and is slightly larger than a grain of rice. It emits a 125-kHz radio
frequency signal that can be picked up by a special scanner up to four
feet away.
The company initially plans to market the chip in the United States as a
medical device that would allow hospital workers to simply scan a
patient's body in an emergency situation to access their health record.
The Jacobses, who live in Boca Raton, Florida, first heard about the
microchip in a television news report.
"Derek stood up and said, 'I want to be the first kid to be implanted with
the chip,'" Leslie Jacobs said. "For the next few days all he did was talk
about the VeriChip."
Derek, an eighth-grader who became a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer
at age 12, fantasizes about merging humans and machines. Jeffrey Jacobs,
who is severely disabled, was interested in the device for health reasons.
So Leslie called up Palm Beach-based ADS and offered her family as guinea
pigs once the microchip is approved for testing by the FDA.
ADS chief technology officer Keith Bolton said he was a bit wary about the
family's motives at first, but the Jacobses quickly convinced him they'd
be perfect subjects. Since the VeriChip was announced in December, the
company has been bombarded with queries from people interested in the
device, Bolton said.
"Right now we have over 2,000 kids who have e-mailed, wanting to have the
chip implanted," he said. "They think it's cool."
Derek, for one, dreams of a day when he'll be able log onto his computers
or unlock his house and turn on the lights without lifting a finger,
functions that British professor Kevin Warwick was able to do in a 1998
experiment with an implanted microchip.
Derek was also inspired by Richard Seelig, the company's director of
medical applications, who injected two VeriChips into himself after
hearing stories of rescue workers at the World Trade Center scrawling
their names and Social Security numbers onto their bodies in case they
didn't make it out of the rubble alive.
"I think it's one more step in the evolution of man and technology," said
Derek, who once needed to move into the family room after his electronics
equipment crowded his bedroom. "There are endless possibilities for this."
(Currently the chip is immutable once the device is injected via a
syringe, using local anesthetic. In future applications, the chip may
include a GPS receiver and other advanced features, company officials
Jeffrey, a 48-year-old cancer survivor, has more practical reasons for
wanting the VeriChip.
"If something happens to me and there's no one that knows anything about
my medical history, any paramedic or hospital worker, if they have the
scanner -- which hopefully everyone will have at some point -- will be
able to scan all my information," he said. "It could save my life."
Leslie, 46, said she was motivated by security concerns. The Sept. 11
terrorist attacks hit close to home: Her family lives in South Florida,
where authorities say 14 of the 19 hijackers lived. Her office is a block
away from tabloid publisher American Media, where a photo editor died
after contracting anthrax.
The world would be a safer place if authorities had a tamper-proof way of
identifying people, she said.
"I have nothing to hide, so I wouldn't mind having the chip for
verification," Leslie Jacobs said. "I already have an ID card, so why not
have a chip?"
Pilots could be chipped and scanned before they entered the cockpit, she
suggested, to ensure the person sitting at the controls was indeed an
airline employee. Her husband went further, suggesting that violent
criminals and known terrorists should be routinely chipped as a matter of

to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that no one

or the number of his name."
Gary Wohlscheid, the president of The Last Day Ministries -- a group
espousing the belief that humanity is on the verge of an apocalyptic
showdown between the forces of good and evil -- believes the VeriChip
could be this mark. Although the chip is not yet small enough to be
injected into the forehead or right hand at the moment, it could be in the

Although the VeriChip is awaiting FDA approval in the United States, the
company recently announced a deal to market the chips to potential kidnap
victims living in South America, such as corporate executives. The device
could be used to identify abduction victims who are unable to communicate
with their rescuers because they are unconscious, drugged or, in a
worst-case scenario, dead.
The company hopes to get the FDA green light in the next couple of months.

ACTIVISM UPDATE:
NPR Continues Distortion on Mideast "Calm"
February 5, 2002
On January 10, FAIR put out an Action Alert asking people to write to
National Public Radio about an apparent blind spot in its Middle East
reporting.  NPR had been referring to the situation in Israel and Palestine
around the New Year as a time of "relative calm" or "comparative quiet,"
explaining at one point that "only one Israeli has been killed in those
three weeks." What NPR didn't explain was that during this "quiet" period,
an average of one Palestinian per day was being killed by Israeli occupation
forces. (See  .)
In answer to our alert, at least several hundred people wrote to NPR,
calling for Middle East reporting that paid attention to the victims of
violence on all sides.  Yet even as these letters were pouring in, NPR
continued to present the same distorted view of the conflict.
All Things Considered anchor Noah Adams opened a January 14 report on the
assassination of a Palestinian militia leader, and the militia's revenge
murder of an Israeli civilian, by declaring that "deadly violence returned
to the Middle East today"--as if deadly violence hadn't been happening to
Palestinians on an almost daily basis all along.  On the January 17 All
Things Considered, anchor Melissa Block prefaced a question by asserting,
"Until early this week there'd been almost a month of relatively reduced
violence there"-- a premise that was not corrected by correspondent Linda
Gradstein.  And on January 18, correspondent Peter Kenyon referred on
Morning Edition to "the recent lull in violence."
NPR ombudsman Jeffrey Dvorkin, to whom the activists' letters were
addressed, does seem to recognize the problem.  Appearing on January 17 with
media critic Ali Abunimah on WJHU, a Baltimore NPR affiliate, Dvorkin agreed
with the criticism and said that NPR's foreign desk had told hosts and
correspondents to reflect the reality of the situation. But this
intervention does not seem to have resulted in changed coverage-- in fact,
two of the repetitions of the distortion noted above occurred within the
next 24 hours. Even as late as January 30, Linda Gradstein was referring to
the "period of relative calm," as if no one had ever pointed out to NPR that
this characterization ignored the deaths of dozens of Palestinians.
Despite the hundreds of individual letters he has received, Dvorkin has yet
to issue a formal comment on the issue. But in a brief January 25 response
to a FAIR activist, Dvorkin wrote, "After FAIR pointed out the phrase
'relative calm,' NPR corrected that inaccuracy in future reports."  In fact,
the inaccuracy was repeated, and keeps being repeated. Something seems to be
amiss in the way NPR handles legitimate complaints from the public.
ACTION: Please write to NPR ombudsman Jeffrey Dvorkin and ask him to respond
substantively to the hundreds of letters he has received about NPR's Mideast
coverage, including an explanation of how NPR can repeat the same distortion
after it has been "corrected."

Blair and Bush nominated for Nobel Peace Prize
Fraser Nelson westminster editor
THE collapse of the Taleban was deemed enough reward for Tony Blair
and George Bushs robust Afghanistan campaign. But yesterday, they
received an unexpected extra: a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Harald Tom Nesvik, a right-wing Norwegian MP with Nobel prize
nomination rights, has put their names forward for the 2002 list.
He is arguing that the two Western leaders have demonstrated their
commitment to peace by making it abundantly clear they will not
tolerate terrorist attacks.
"The background for my nomination is their decisive action against
terrorism, something I believe in the future will be the greatest
threat to peace," Mr Nesvik said yesterday. "Unfortunately, sometimes
you have to use force to secure peace."
The Oslo-based awards committee has been accepting nominations from 1
However, Mr Blair and Mr Bush are nowhere near a shortlist. Last
year, 136 individuals and groups were nominated; this years count is
expected to exceed 160, with many nominees linked to 11 September and
its aftermath. The nomination would please Mr Blair, who argued
throughout that the bombing campaign was intended to lay the
foundations for lasting world peace.
Today, Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, will add to this theme by
spelling out a £50 billion aid package billed as a "global new deal"
which will share the Wests wealth with destitute countries and pre-
vent a resurgence of terrorism. In the last 40 years, the Nobel Peace
Prize has only come to the United Kingdom once - when David Trimble
and John Hume were recognised in 1998 for their work in the Northern
Ireland peace process.
Other laureates include Nelson Mandela and de FW Klerk, Mikhail
Gorbachev, Lech Walesa, Martin Luther King and Mother Teresa.

Report: U.S. paid villagers over raid
   Rumsfeld: U.S.
   investigating;
   he says he has
   no knowledge
   of payments      Three men walk away from a grave site near the town of Uruzgan, where
   villagers claim that U.S. special forces wrongly killed at least 18
   men.
   MSNBC STAFF AND WIRE REPORTS
   Feb. 4 --  Afghan officials say the United States has conceded that a
   deadly raid in a southern Afghan village two weeks ago was a mistake
   and that families of those killed had been given compensation -- in
   $100 bills -- according to a report broadcast Monday.
          U.S. FORCES have returned to investigate claims that they
   killed the wrong people in the raid, and they should apologize on the
   spot if the claims prove true, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said
   Monday.
          U.S. soldiers have gone to the area in Uruzgan province where
   special forces killed 15 or 16 people and arrested 27 in a nighttime
   raid two weeks ago, Rumsfeld said at a Pentagon news conference.
          Rumsfeld admitted for the first time that it was possible that
   a U.S. military assault on two compounds Jan. 24 resulted in their
   "unfortunately killing or wounding some individuals who might have
   been friendly."
          According to a report broadcast Monday by NPR News, however,
   senior Afghan officials said that the United States had already
   expressed regret over the raid at Uruzgan and had even paid the
   victims' families $1,000 each in U.S. cash.
          Responding to a question, Rumsfeld said he had no information
   about reports of such apologies or payments.
          "I do know that U.S. soldiers have gone back into the area, I
   believe with Afghans, to try to determine the facts," he said.
          "I would hope that if, in the course of that, they discover
   that somebody was in fact killed who should not have been killed ...
   that American forces would express apologies. I can't say that I know
   that, but I would hope they would."
   PENTAGON ABOUT-FACE
          After days of insisting they had struck the right people,
   Pentagon officials said last week that they would investigate the
   incident. The interim Afghan government led by Hamid Karzai said it
   also was investigating.
          Rumsfeld said he recalled Karzai's telling someone in the U.S.
   military that "in the event that it turns out that people were in fact
   killed who were friendly to the interim government, that would be
   unfortunate, and it would be helpful if some way could be found to
   compensate them."
          The Pentagon has insisted that U.S. special forces attacked a
   legitimate military target in the raid on an ammunition dump that
   intelligence analysts believed al-Qaida or Taliban forces were using.
          But some Afghans said Taliban renegades were handing over
   weapons to Karzai's government at the site. They said that some
   pro-Karzai figures were killed and that others, including a police
   chief, his deputy and members of a district council, were among those
   arrested.
   COMMAND POST MOVING TO BAHRAIN
          Meanwhile, the top Marine Corps general for Central Asia and
   the Persian Gulf is moving his command post from Hawaii to Bahrain in
   another sign that the U.S. anti-terror campaign in Afghanistan and
   elsewhere won't be over any time soon.
          Lt. Gen. Earl Hailston moved to Bahrain in mid-January on
   Rumsfeld's orders, said his spokesman in Hawaii, Lt. Col. Pat Sivigny.
          Hailston, who oversees the Marines' operations in both the
   Central and Pacific commands, joins Central Command chiefs for the Air
   Force and the Army, who moved to the region in recent months, and the
   Navy's 5th Fleet, which already had a base there. The Navy component
   of Central Command is headquartered in Bahrain, the Air Force's is in
   Saudi Arabia and the Army's is in Kuwait.
          Also, some Marines who had been deployed to the Afghan campaign
   have moved to the coast of Africa for a three-week joint exercise with
   Kenyan forces, Pentagon officials said Monday.
          More than 2,000 Marines began the amphibious exercise Sunday.
   Officials said it had been planned for months and was not a sign that
   military action was planned soon in neighboring Somalia, where
   officials fear al-Qaida terrorists from Afghanistan could seek refuge.
   FACTIONAL FIGHTING
          Also Monday, efforts to quell Afghanistan's worst factional
   fighting since the fall of the Taliban had mixed results. Under
   supervision of the United Nations, opposing forces in the north agreed
   to work toward a demilitarization but, in the east, government
   mediators reportedly failed to push two warring tribes into a peace
   deal and ordered both sides to send delegations to Kabul for more
   talks.
          In the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, two factions agreed to
   set up a security commission to demilitarize under the supervision of
   the United Nations. Several days of clashes there last week killed
   more than 40 people.
          Mohammad Sardar Saeedi, of the Hezb-i-Wahdat party, said Uzbek
   warlord general Abdul Rashid Dostum and his rival ethnic Tajik
   commander, Ustad Atta Mohammad, had decided to hand control of the
   city to a security commission led by Hezb-i-Wahdat.
          Both Dostum and Mohammad are part of the U.N.-brokered interim
   government in Kabul.
          The commission will deploy 200 fighters from each group as
   police to maintain security and law and order in the aftermath of
   three days of the fighting on the outskirts of the city between forces
   under Dostum and Atta, Saeedi said. [dotblack.gif]
   [37][lnk_story.gif] NBC: Karzai up against warlord rivalries
   [dotblack.gif]
          "There is no problem anymore. A cease-fire has been enforced,"
   Saeedi said.
          Mazar-e-Sharif was the scene of bitter factional fighting for
   several years before the hard-line Taliban seized control in 1998 and
   brought relative security.
          The United States dislodged the Taliban under the weight of
   heavy airstrikes and Northern Alliance ground forces following the
   Sept. 11 terror attacks on the United States, which Washington blames
   on [38]Osama bin Laden and his [39]al-Qaida network, which had been
   sheltered by the Taliban for years.
          Representatives of the Northern Alliance now comprise the bulk
   of the interim administration.
          As part of the deal struck on Sunday, all heavy machine guns,
   tanks and armored personnel carriers will be withdrawn from
   Mazar-e-Sharif under the supervision of a U.N observer who will be
   involved in regular mediation, Saeedi said.
          "The formation of the commission is welcomed by the people who
   were really concerned about the recent fighting," he said.
          NBC's Tom Aspell, The Associated Press and Reuters contributed
   to this report.

[This article should not surprise anyone on the list.  We all

Some States Track Parolees by Satellite
By JENNIFER 8. LEE
TAMPA, Fla. -- THEY call it being on the box.
It's not prison. It's not freedom. It's a gray area between.
John Zadrayel, a 40-year-old convicted sex offender, has been on the
box for a year, a condition of his parole after 14 years in prison.
The box, a four-pound electronic device that resembles a transistor
radio, lets parole officers know exactly where he is at all times. It
calculates his location using the Global Positioning System, a network
of 24 satellites 12,000 miles above the earth.
Mr. Zadrayel carries the box around with him all the time, even when
he is bicycling from his rented room to his job as a cook in a local
restaurant. Some nights he wakes up thinking about it.
He wears a wireless bracelet, locked around his ankle, that transmits
a signal to the box to let it know he's there. When he leaves his room
to watch the ducks in a neighboring pond, he has to remember to stay
within 100 feet of the box. If he were to stray too far or abandon the
box completely, he would be in violation of his parole and could be
sent back to prison.
Mr. Zadrayel is one of about 1,200 offenders nationwide who are using
G.P.S. monitoring devices as a condition of their parole or probation
or as a form of house arrest. They are a small but growing fraction of
the 150,000 offenders in the United States who are subject to more
established forms of electronic supervision like home monitoring
systems and mandatory telephone checks.
Traditional systems, many of which also use ankle bracelets but
without G.P.S., can only confirm whether a person is at a designated
place at a designated time. G.P.S. devices allow the authorities to
check up on an offender at any time.
Although the technology is relatively new and not without glitches,
criminologists say that improved monitoring may help governments
address the longstanding problem of how to protect the public without
resorting to the further incarceration of criminals. Systems like the
box, they say, also offer a glimpse of a future in which imprisonment
may be more a function of technology than of bricks and bars.
By tracking parolees' movements in real time - and notifying the
authorities immediately when violations occur - the system offers a
measure of reassurance to local residents when there are criminals in
their midst.
"Very few people get locked up for the rest of their lives," said
Peggy Conway, editor of The Journal of Offender
Monitoring. "Ultimately these people are going to live in the
More precise monitoring and tracking may also prompt the authorities
to release some prisoners earlier, or even eliminate prison sentences
for some first-time offenses. In Florida, it costs $45 a day to keep
someone in the state prison system, compared with about $10 a day for
surveillance with the G.P.S. device.
Currently 27 states are using some type of satellite surveillance, and
some provinces in Canada are also considering using the
technology. Florida has been the most eager adopter, with almost 600
offenders on the box, partly because Pro Tech Monitoring, the leading
G.P.S. surveillance company, is based in the state.
"It's like Big Brother," said Jim Sommerkamp, a senior probation
supervisor here in Hillsborough County, who supervises Mr. Zadrayel
using Pro Tech's system, known as Satellite Monitoring and Remote
And in this case, officials say, Big Brother is a good thing. People
who have committed crimes once are likely to commit them again; about
half of those released from prison are convicted of a new crime within
three years. As a constant reminder that the government is watching,
G.P.S. monitoring may discourage repeat crimes.
Adoption of the technology has been somewhat slow because the state
and local authorities are reluctant to commit themselves to a system
that still has rough edges. For one thing, the G.P.S. satellite
signals are often blocked when offenders are inside buildings or
outside in areas with many tall buildings. (If a signal is lost for
more than a few minutes, an alert is sent.) The system is also not
suitable for rural areas where the local cellphone infrastructure may
be inadequate. The monitoring is also labor-intensive: at $10 a day,
Pro Tech's system costs twice as much as traditional electronic
"Many states say it's too expensive, it's too bulky, it's too
unreliable," Dr.  Johnson said. "Until they fix some of those
problems, they're not going to consider it."
But as the technology matures, satellite tracking will inevitably be
an important part of the penal system, experts say.
"We want to create a jail without walls in the community - a virtual
jail," Ms. Conway said. "You can reinforce positive community behavior
- going to work, going to a prescribed treatment program, not being in
crime-opportunity areas."

@_subject: Kremlin `faked' terrorist attacks on apartments 
GENERAL NEWS - Saturday 02 February 2002  Kremlin `faked' terrorist attacks on apartments PATRICK E TYLER Intensifying his battle with the Kremlin, the Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky said on Thursday that he was just weeks away from laying out documentary evidence that Russia's security services were involved in apartment house explosions in September 1999 that killed more than 300 In an interview in London, he said his investigation of the bombings _ which were blamed on separatists in Chechnya and triggered a full-scale invasion of that rebellious republic _ was the reason Nikolai Patrushev, Russia's intelligence chief, accused him last week of providing financial support to Chechen ``terrorists''.
Mr Berezovsky said his evidence ``is no less than the evidence the United States had that Osama bin Laden was responsible for the World Trade Center attack''.
He said the key to his case was the discovery in late September 1999 that Russia's security services had placed what appeared to be a large bomb in an apartment in Ryazan, 115 miles southeast of Moscow.
When residents discovered the bomb and called the police, the Federal Security Service, or FSB, issued a public apology and asserted that the ``explosives'' were actually bags of sugar tied together with wires and a detonator, a dummy used as part of a security exercise.
A number of Russian legislators called for an independent investigation of the bombings and the actions of the security service in Ryazan, but in March 2000 parliament defeated a motion to open an inquiry. Vladimir Putin, a former head of the FSB, won the presidential election the same month. Mr Patrushev succeeded him at the security service.
In the jaded politics of today's Russia, Mr Berezovsky's claims have been treated with as much scepticism as the counter-claims of Mr Patrushev and the security service. The fact that the charges emerged as Mr Berezovsky was losing another battle to retain control of the independent TV6 television channel added to that scepticism.
Yet the unsolved explosions that brought terror to Russia and incited Russians against Chechens and other ethnic groups from the Caucasus stand as an enduring and troubling mystery of the Chechen conflict.
Though dozens of arrests were made in the bombings, no one has been convicted of direct complicity. Moreover, the bombings laid the groundwork for the furious military campaign against Chechnya and for the political rise of Mr Putin, then the prime minister, whose relentless prosecution of the war garnered a surge of popular support that propelled him into the presidency.
Mr Berezovsky said on Thursday that he had no evidence that Mr Putin had personal knowledge of any involvement by security services in the apartment bombings, but he said Mr Patrushev did.
``I don't have any facts today that Putin is involved personally,'' he
said. ``I have facts that the chief of the FSB is involved in that, and
other people from the FSB are involved.''
While he said the evidence implicated Mr Patrushev, ``I don't have the answer as to who gave the order _ whether it was Putin, Patrushev or someone else.''
The resurrection of the case highlights the tenacity of Mr Berezovsky, the consummate Kremlin insider in the era of former president Boris Yeltsin. From exile in London, where he is fighting legal battles over his holdings and an arrest warrant issued last autumn, he continues to strike at Mr Putin in the name of liberal and democratic causes, even when many liberals shun him.
And in the end, there is the question of whether Mr Berezovsky is simply
trying to orchestrate a political crisis for Mr Putin to win political
asylum in Britain as a means to protect permanently the wealth he carved
out of Russia in the early days, when the pickings were easy.
Mr Berezovsky responded to this question by saying: ``You won't have to
wait long'' to judge the merit of his case. He would not discuss whether
he planned to seek asylum, but said he would be in danger if he returned
to Russia.
``I don't want to tell you that I expect that they would kill me,'' he
said. ``I am not able to say that. But I cannot exclude anything.''
Mr Berezovsky works these days out of a suite of offices on fashionable
Savile Row, where he manages a business empire that is as hard to define
as it is to measure in value. But over the last decade, he is believed to
have controlled major stakes in Russian automobile enterprises, oil and
aluminum companies, Aeroflot and ORT, the state television combine, from
which he was ejected after Mr Putin became president.
Last week, after Mr Berezovsky lost a battle to keep TV6 on the air with a
crew of journalists who had fled the independent NTV network, the security
director, Mr Patrushev, surprised him with a new assault.
Speaking in a televised interview, Mr Patrushev said his bureau had
information that Mr Berezovsky was involved in financing Chechen rebels.
``This applies primarily to the funding of unlawful armed formations and
their leaders,'' he said, adding that his agency planned to ``duly
document'' the charges and relay the information ``to our partners abroad,
and wait for a proper reaction from them''.
The next day, the security agency's spokesman, Alexander Zdanovich, said
at a news conference that Mr Berezovsky ``is financing terrorist
activity'' in Chechnya.
Responding to the allegations, Mr Berezovsky admitted that he has had
extensive contacts with Chechen separatist leaders, especially from 1997
to 1999, when he was deputy national security adviser to Mr Yeltsin and
later a Kremlin adviser.
He admits giving $2 million of his own money in 1997 to a Chechen field
commander, Shamil Basayev, when Mr Basayev was serving as Chechnya's prime
minister. The money was intended for restoration of a cement factory, he
said, but he admitted it might have been used for other purposes.
``It was not my function to control how he spent the money,'' Mr
Berezovsky said, adding that Russian security officials were aware of the
gift at the time, though they were not pleased about it.
Mr Berezovsky was also involved in negotiating the release of kidnap
victims in Chechnya. He said he won the freedom of 64 hostages, though he
was criticised at the time for reportedly paying ransoms that fuelled the
kidnapping trade. He denied paying ransom in all but one case, involving
NTV journalists, but he admitted he provided substantial aid in the form
of computers and other marketable goods. Despite the controversial nature
of his involvement, Mr Berezovsky was praised by senior Russian officials,
including Mr Putin's current national security adviser, Vladimir Rushailo,
for his efforts to free captives in the mid-1990s. Even today, Mr
Berezovsky maintains contact with Chechen separatist leaders. He met in
London on Wednesday with Akhmed Zakayev, the envoy of the Chechen
president, Aslan Maskhadov, whom Moscow brands a terrorist. ``I am helping
him to recover his health,'' Mr Berezovsky said. ``He was wounded during
the war and is now in hospital. If they call that help for terrorists,
then it is so.''

Innocent Muslims killed as Bush allies 'crusade'
Shootings and torture by security forces are spreading fear in the
Philippines, the new flashpoint in the US war.
Film-makers Jonathan Miller
and Rob Lemkin report
Sunday February 3, 2002
The Observer
Syed Kaing Mabbul was a coconut farmer on the exquisitely beautiful island
of Basilan in the southern Philippines, the hottest new target in
President George W. Bush's global war on terrorism. His misfortune, his
mother told us, is that he has the same name as a commander of the Abu
Sayyaf, a bloodthirsty group of Islamic extremists financed by robbery,
piracy, ransom and - in the past, at least - by Osama bin Laden.
About 150 Americans, the advance party of a force of about 650, are already
in the southern Philippines for a six-month 'military' exercise that began
formally last Thursday. Their task is to train Filipino soldiers how better
to fight Abu Sayyaf, and to rescue kidnapped missionaries Martin and Gracia
Burnham of Wichita, Kansas, who have been in captivity for eight months.
Syed fled the island last May, and has been living in a lean-to shack on the
outskirts of Zamboanga City, on the island of Mindanao, about 15 miles north
of Basilan across a turquoise sea.
Local Muslims took us to meet Syed's mother, Azirah Mabhul. She told us he
had been betrayed to the army by seven fellow Muslims who had split a bounty
of a million pesos (about £14,000).
'They picked up my son at 8am,' she told us. 'They brought him to
Malagutay Brigade Camp, blindfolded him, beat him, stripped him, then hung
him upside down for eight hours. They inserted ground-up chilli paste into
his rectum to force him to confess to belonging to Abu Sayyaf.'
Azirah said that when she finally located her son, he still couldn't sit
down. 'Mum,' he said, 'I just can't take the pain any more.'
In mid-December, Syed Kaing Mabbul was taken, with 79 other terrorist
suspects, to a high security jail in the capital, Manila. He hasn't been
heard from since.
It was impossible to confirm his story, but Muslim community leaders vouched
for his innocence. His case is one of many accounts of harassment,
indiscriminate arrest, disappearances, routine torture and killing now
producing growing concern over 'gross and rampant human rights violations'
against Muslim civilians.
Human rights leaders point the finger at the America's new ally in its
global war, the Philippine armed forces. Since 11 September, they say,
incidents of abuse have grown, and there is a palpable climate of fear.
'We are the ones who are living in terror,' said the imam of a mosque in a
squalid Muslim ghetto on the edge of Zamboanga City. 'This war against
terror is just the latest campaign in a 400-year crusade against Islam,'
he said, echoing the convictions of the wider Islamic world.
Although the Philippines' five million Muslims comprise a minority in
Asia's only Roman Catholic country, they no longer feel on the fringe of
the global Islamic community.
Syed's case was just one 'among hundreds,' said Zenaida Sabaani-Lawi,
director of Murid, a Muslim organisation which provides micro-finance to
local women. 'There have been killings too. It's been getting worse since
11 September. It's as if they now have a licence,' she said. 'This is
state terror.'

The Palestinian Vision of Peace
By YASIR ARAFAT
RAMALLAH  For the past 16 months, Israelis and Palestinians have been
locked in a catastrophic cycle of violence, a cycle which only promises more
bloodshed and fear. The cycle has led many to conclude that peace is
impossible, a myth borne out of ignorance of the Palestinian position. Now
is the time for the Palestinians to state clearly, and for the world to hear
clearly, the Palestinian vision.
But first, let me be very clear. I condemn the attacks carried out by
terrorist groups against Israeli civilians. These groups do not represent
the Palestinian people or their legitimate aspirations for freedom. They are
terrorist organizations, and I am determined to put an end to their
The Palestinian vision of peace is an independent and viable Palestinian
state on the territories occupied by Israel in 1967, living as an equal
neighbor alongside Israel with peace and security for both the Israeli and
Palestinian peoples. In 1988, the Palestine National Council adopted a
historic resolution calling for the implementation of applicable United
Nations resolutions, particularly, Resolutions 242 and 338. The Palestinians
recognized Israel's right to exist on 78 percent of historical Palestine
with the understanding that we would be allowed to live in freedom on the
remaining 22 percent, which has been under Israeli occupation since 1967.
Our commitment to that two-state solution remains unchanged, but
unfortunately, also remains unreciprocated.
We seek true independence and full sovereignty: the right to control our own
airspace, water resources and borders; to develop our own economy, to have
normal commercial relations with our neighbors, and to travel freely. In
short, we seek only what the free world now enjoys and only what Israel
insists on for itself: the right to control our own destiny and to take our
place among free nations.
In addition, we seek a fair and just solution to the plight of Palestinian
refugees who for 54 years have not been permitted to return to their homes.
We understand Israel's demographic concerns and understand that the right of
return of Palestinian refugees, a right guaranteed under international law
and United Nations Resolution 194, must be implemented in a way that takes
into account such concerns. However, just as we Palestinians must be
realistic with respect to Israel's demographic desires, Israelis too must be
realistic in understanding that there can be no solution to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict if the legitimate rights of these innocent
civilians continue to be ignored. Left unresolved, the refugee issue has the
potential to undermine any permanent peace agreement between Palestinians
and Israelis. How is a Palestinian refugee to understand that his or her
right of return will not be honored but those of Kosovar Albanians, Afghans
and East Timorese have been?
There are those who claim that I am not a partner in peace. In response, I
say Israel's peace partner is, and always has been, the Palestinian people.
Peace is not a signed agreement between individuals  it is reconciliation
between peoples. Two peoples cannot reconcile when one demands control over
the other, when one refuses to treat the other as a partner in peace, when
one uses the logic of power rather than the power of logic. Israel has yet
to understand that it cannot have peace while denying justice. As long as
the occupation of Palestinian lands continues, as long as Palestinians are
denied freedom, then the path to the "peace of the brave" that I embarked
upon with my late partner Yitzhak Rabin, will be littered with obstacles.
The Palestinian people have been denied their freedom for far too long and
are the only people in the world still living under foreign occupation. How
is it possible that the entire world can tolerate this oppression,
discrimination and humiliation? The 1993 Oslo Accord, signed on the White
House lawn, promised the Palestinians freedom by May 1999. Instead, since
1993, the Palestinian people have endured a doubling of Israeli settlers,
expansion of illegal Israeli settlements on Palestinian land and increased
restrictions on freedom of movement. How do I convince my people that Israel
is serious about peace while over the past decade Israel intensified the
colonization of Palestinian land from which it was ostensibly negotiating a
But no degree of oppression and no level of desperation can ever justify the
killing of innocent civilians. I condemn terrorism. I condemn the killing of
innocent civilians, whether they are Israeli, American or Palestinian;
whether they are killed by Palestinian extremists, Israeli settlers, or by
the Israeli government. But condemnations do not stop terrorism. To stop
terrorism, we must understand that terrorism is simply the symptom, not the
The personal attacks on me currently in vogue may be highly effective in
giving Israelis an excuse to ignore their own role in creating the current
situation. But these attacks do little to move the peace process forward
and, in fact, are not designed to. Many believe that Ariel Sharon, Israel's
prime minister, given his opposition to every peace treaty Israel has ever
signed, is fanning the flames of unrest in an effort to delay indefinitely a
return to negotiations. Regrettably, he has done little to prove them wrong.
Israeli government practices of settlement construction, home demolitions,
political assassinations, closures and shameful silence in the face of
Israeli settler violence and other daily humiliations are clearly not aimed
at calming the situation.
The Palestinians have a vision of peace: it is a peace based on the complete
end of the occupation and a return to Israel's 1967 borders, the sharing of
all Jerusalem as one open city and as the capital of two states, Palestine
and Israel. It is a warm peace between two equals enjoying mutually
beneficial economic and social cooperation. Despite the brutal repression of
Palestinians over the last four decades, I believe when Israel sees
Palestinians as equals, and not as a subjugated people upon whom it can
impose its will, such a vision can come true. Indeed it must.
Palestinians are ready to end the conflict. We are ready to sit down now
with any Israeli leader, regardless of his history, to negotiate freedom for
the Palestinians, a complete end of the occupation, security for Israel and
creative solutions to the plight of the refugees while respecting Israel's
demographic concerns. But we will only sit down as equals, not as
supplicants; as partners, not as subjects; as seekers of a just and peaceful
solution, not as a defeated nation grateful for whatever scraps are thrown
our way. For despite Israel's overwhelming military advantage, we possess
something even greater: the power of justice.
Yasir Arafat was elected president of the Palestinian Authority in 1996 and
is also chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

Polygraphers frequently claim that any experienced polygraph examiner can

A strange state of being this war on terror.
It is a global war until the end of all evil is in sight.
it is a war that will outlast forever - it is a license to
spend the public purse on an unlimited number of evil doers.
It is a war that will destroy the terror of multivitamins,
it is a war that elevate the multinationals to godhead, where
the supermen will be bred to end the terror of individuality.
this war will build information databases like no other, and
will arrest you if you refuse to take the poison that has been
allocated specifically to you.
it will end the terror of childhood and give to the new generations
the certainty that they can misuse their lives if they choose.
this war on terror will end the terror of liberty and replace it with
the sanity of rule. It will seek out evil everywhere, the evils of
defamation, the evils of being outspoken - it will silence the Internet
It is a war on the terror of the parents when they realise that their
children have been poisoned by toxic diet and society beyond the point where
they can be easily cured. It is a war on the terror of parents who realise
that they are going to outlast their children - whose young growing tissues
cannot mature on the poisons they are being fed.
It is a war that hopes to disintegrate and divide - and rule.
Aside from the ongoing population cull though -
I foresee the breakup and regionalisation of the United States of America.
Its called Devolution.
Its a scam they foisted on us in the UK for by breaking up the UK into
impotent regions they could create more beaurocracy and more taxes and less
democracy. [consensus government]
The big global superstate and its components like the EU is made
up of small regional villages.
The same model applied to the USA would break the country up into Federated
Regions answering not to Washington but to the UN.
They may decide to carve up the USA by using racial profiling -
maybe creating a mexican superstate in the south. eg. Aztlan becomes the
mexican village - they may use religious profiling, maybe to identify and
isolate fundamentalist pockets -
You may get the creation of Mormonia - capital salt lake
the city states of LA or new york [enter kurt russell] the
babylonain/sumerian city state maybe ring fenced with the invincible
overlords as their black nobility.
If state borders were closed with the creation of new 'countries' within the
USA - people would not be able to move about - an ideal situation if
multinational companies want 'captive employees' anchored in their region.
to help with the reassimilation of the citizens in their new countries -
vast new biometric databases will profile the 'abnormal'
and facilitate the diagnosis of deviance and potential terror
suspects eg. vegetarians
Changes of linguistic and religious priorities would further strengthen the
case for the Devolution of the american dream and melting pot into its
Individual components.
Then by media enhanced differences causing at the same time the alienation
and the 'embrace' of global values - the state of the union is no longer one
state but many - ruled by an unrelenting axis of evil illuminazis.
I'm willing to bet that the company shell that was called Enron still exists
and has just acquired a new name - Noner.
If you see how the incestuous UK bilderburgers and enron executives promoted
themselves and funded their excesses to the heights of their paranoia - you
will see that the energy department in the uk govt.  is still being run by
Sick transatlantic and global sleaze, with bought prime ministers who have
not the courage to admit to the parents of this country that they are
frauds. Tony though, emperir of eurodisney in waiting - just like the walt
disney franchise - is an idea whose time has already gone.
Blond haired blue eyed superTony awaits in the wings, whilst the athletic
Dubya whose supertuned cardiovascular system has produced a heart so mean it
cant be bothered beating - has already got a hit out on the Pretzel Company
The day of our global village is come and though the armed and touchy
american public is getting circumspect treatment, maybe even resiliently
holding the fragmentation up with its pride and patriotism and 911 flags-
there appear to be many measures in place to indiscriminately lift any

But ....... How can you arrest a Dream - the american dream ??

"THE ENRON BLACK MAGIC, PART FOUR" by Sherman H. Skolnick 1/28/02
THE SWINDLERS and THEIR VICTIMS
Those who grow up in a big city and are political commentators, sort of know things by second nature. If they are outspoken, they may even describe their lifelong home-town, right to the point, with a few words. Some years ago, for a period of time, I opened my Chicago-based recorded phone commentary message [(773) 731-1100], with "This is Sherman Skolnick, from the mafia-CIA capital of the world". After a while, because of numerous examples, I and my associates came to understand the names of the large law firms and accounting houses that are part of the espionage/criminal cartel. One such has been Arthur Andersen & Company. In Chicago, in years past, two Federal District Judges, by the greatest non-coincidence and mysterious forces, had slipped onto their dockets most all of the cases in the nation involving the American CIA. [Assignment of cases, as we have pointed out, is one of the main steps of the BIG FIX.] One such judge was George Leighton. As shown by records uncovered by us in the National Archives, Leighton had been in 1963 the secret CIA attorney for Lee Harvey Oswald, the CIA created patsy and falsely blamed "lone assassin" of President John F. Kennedy. Judge Leighton, without jurisdiction over me, once tried to falsely jail me as an assassination researcher. But that is a story for another day.
Another one of CIA's Judges in Chicago was U.S. District Judge Hubert L. Will. In the 1950s, he had been CIA's Chief of Counter-
Intelligence in Europe, stationed in Berlin. It was thus natural that in 1970 my suit against the National Archives and Record Service was assigned to him. For the only time in U.S. history, somehow eleven secret documents had been purloined from the Archives. Falling into my possession, attached to my suit, they showed that the U.S. Secret Service had covered up a plot to assassinate President Kennedy in Chicago on the way to his appearance at a football game, two and a half weeks before being actually murdered in Dallas. Part of the cover-up was to falsely jail the first black Secret Service agent, Abraham Bolden, assigned to guarding the President at his residence. A person as a double for "Lee Harvey Oswald", was waiting along the proposed parade route to murder the President.
In Court, I confronted Judge Will, holding in my hand as an Exhibit, a copy of the book, published in Europe but banned from distribution in the U.S., "Who's Who in CIA". [I and my associates were about the only ones in the U.S. who somehow had copies. We gave them away at college speeches in return for small donations. Alas, no more copies are left.] "I'm not with them anymore", the Judge poo-pooed my demand that he step aside. "Come on now, Judge," I reasoned with him, "The CIA is a mail-box, once you are in, you are there even if later you claim to be on the bench". He denied my request to recuse himself. Naturally, the CIA and the U.S. Secret Service, involved in the suit, won. I was put out of Court without further legal formality. "THE ENRON BLACK MAGIC", Part Four continued, by Sherman H. Skolnick 1/28/02 Not a coincidence, later in the 1970s, Judge Will had the case involving the embezzlement of Rockefeller's unit, First National Bank of Chicago. [To confuse matters since then, they have changed their name to Bank One.] Millions and millions of dollars disappeared from the bank's branch in Athens, Greece. Sources told us it was a "permitted" rip-off by the American CIA to secretly finance the Greek mafia to do dirty tricks against political dissidents. The bank's auditors and consultants were Arthur Andersen & Co., with a long previous history of being reportedly instrumental with the Mafia/CIA activities in Chicago. [For background, study the details, believed by savvy sorts to be accurate, in the book written by family members of CIA gangster/assassination arranger "Momo" Giancana---how the CIA uses mobsters like "Momo", then later murders them by way of throwing them away, "Double Cross The Explosive Inside Story of the Mobsters Who Controlled America, Vol. 1," by Sam Giancana and Chuck Giancana (contributor), Mass Market Paperback, Warner Books, Inc., 1993. It deals with the great dangers of trusting the Kennedy Family and the American CIA. A kingpin in Arthur Andersen's law firm was R. Sargent Shriver who was married into the family of "Founding Father" Joseph P. Kennedy and his assassinated sons, John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. About 1975, Shriver was the speaker at Rockefeller Chapel, on the campus of Rockefeller's University of Chicago. Shriver's speech was about "International Relations". After the speech, we interviewed Shriver as the attorney for Arthur Andersen & Co., on tape, in the doorway of the Chapel. We grilled Shriver about how his client, Arthur Andersen & Co., is beating back a subpoena in the First National Bank embezzlement case, by switching their structure to overseas, to a Swiss form of business. Shriver went into a discussion of how his client, Arthur Andersen & Co., had the right to move their business structure to Switzerland, beyond the jurisdiction of Judge Will and a subpoena, and reform themselves in a European-style operation called Societe Generale [which is neither a partnership, limited or otherwise, as U.S. practices require of lawyers and accountants, nor a corporation, limited or otherwise.] He did not adequately explain why it was done just as they had to respond to a court subpoena. He denied it was simply to evade the subpoena, although done apparently just at that point in the litigation. Although I was known by Judge Will as a judge-buster and long-time critic of his patron, the American CIA, the Judge occasionally would have brief talks with me outside of court. In front of the courthouse, I asked, "Judge, why did you permit Arthur Andersen and their attorneys to block pertinent data from subpoena in the First National Bank embezzlement case?" Matter-of-a-factly, he quickly responded, "National security. It had to be done." I insisted, "But Judge, millions and millions of dollars disappeared from the Athens branch. Arthur Andersen and their attorneys are covering it up". [Obvious and left unsaid by me, was that Judge Will was likewise covering it up in his Court.] I did not want to ask the Judge about his CIA cronies. I figured he would walk away from me and not talk to me at all if I asked that. The Judge repeated, "National security. Part of eight such events.It was necessary." WOW! Eight such embezzlements covered up. Another Mafia/CIA example is First National Bank of Cicero. This worldwide money laundry for the criminal/espionage cabal, has been the headquarters in the Chicago mafia enclave of Cicero, known locally as Al Capone Land. The Bishop from the local Catholic Church there was Paul Marcinkus. Even after he left Cicero to become head of the Vatican Bank, he nevertheless continued to be the dominant force calling the shots as to the bank in Cicero. [To confuse matters, the bank has changed their name several times. Such as, they became the flagship of Pinnacle Banc Group, the alter ego and successor to supposedly defunct and infamous Bank of Credit and Commerce International, BCCI, and then various other names, such as Old Kent Bank.] The Vatican under international law is a separate sovereignty. So, in November, 1991, when Marcinkus fled Italy to return to Chicago, he did so under the protection of his Vatican passport and position. The Italian authorities contend they want him extradited, to question him and presumably to prosecute him, for being the key player, along with reportedly the Archbishop of Barcelona, Spain, and others, in worldwide trafficking in stolen and smuggled gold, selling to state-
sponsored terrorists osmium nuclear bomb triggers, high quality counterfeit currencies, and various types of financial dirty tricks. All done and supervised by Marcinkus as Vatican Bank Chief jointly with the traditional and other mafia, and the American CIA. A retired CIA bribery paymaster, Roger D'Onoffrio, with dual U.S. and Italian citizenship, living near Naples, was part of the Marcinkus gang. Various stories on this, early in December, 1995, were carried, date-
line Rome, by wire services, Reuters, Associated Press, and United Press International. After Marcinkus returned to the Chicago-area, we interviewed, on tape, the Italian Consul-General in Chicago. We asked whether he was taking any action to return Marcinkus to Italy to face the charges. The Italian diplomat said that, so far, he was not asked to do so. Marcinkus thereafter left Chicago to reside in Sun City, Arizona. Shortly after Marcinkus' return to Chicago, an important official of the Chicago U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Wallace Lieberman, was found murdered, gangland-style. His body was found several blocks away from the First National Bank of Cicero, just before Christmas, 1991. On-location at the murder site, behind an auto repair shop, and again at the nearby bank, we did a one-hour television documentary for our public access Cable TV Show in Chicago. No other media outlets took much interest in this political assassination. Top officials of Arthur Andersen, including a managing partner, supervised the accounting and consulting for the First National Bank of Cicero, reportedly at the behest of Bishop Marcinkus. Andersen and their lawyers [now called Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson] for decades have specialized in handling reputed secret book-cooking and clandestine investments for the Catholic hierarchy, in various places in the U.S. and overseas. At the time Marcinkus fled Italy for Chicago, Wallace Lieberman was scheduled to testify before a Federal Grand Jury in Chicago. His testimony together with that of others, was expected to be reportedly the basis for federal criminal indictment of top officials of Arthur Andersen, their attorneys, several bribe-taking Bankruptcy judges and their lawyer-cronies as bribe-arrangers. Also facing possible indictment were officials of the First National Bank of Cicero jointly with those of Household International, Household Bank, and Household Finance. In December, 1991, a few days before the murder of key witness Wallace Lieberman, I discussed (I thought in confidence) with a Chicago FBI official in the office of an assistant U.S. Attorney in Chicago. I related what our investigation, as a public interest group, had uncovered about Lieberman, the court-authorized bankruptcy auctioneer; the Bankruptcy court bribery; the crooked role of Arthur Andersen and their attorneys; and Household and the bank in Cicero and Paul Marcinkus; and secret Vatican funds in the Continental Bank of Chicago, a major owner of which and corrupt collaborator was Chief Judge Walter Cummings of the U.S. Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit, Chicago. Banker-Judge Cummings was a "man of trust" for the Church, sworn to keep their transactions secret. Up to that point having long-time corrupt immunity from federal criminal prosecution had been Lieberman and his auction business partner, Robert Belavia, a well-known, allowed-to-run-wild gangster. [After Lieberman was murdered, suddenly the highly corrupt top IRS brass in Chicago woke up and decided it was necessary to silence Belavia by belatedly putting him in jail, with the aid of the Injustice Department, on long-known tax cheating.] Lieberman was murdered right before Christmas, and the Chicago Tribune printed the watered-down story on the holiday, when most people had other things on their mind. (Chicago Tribune, Wallace Lieberman, Belavia story, December 25, 1991.) Do the Chicago FBI and the federal prosecutors protect key witnesses, or jointly and corruptly with the Mob, the CIA, and crooked bankers and accountants, arrange to snuff them out? Later, I found out the Assistant prosecutor I spoke to went on special assignment in the Oklahoma City federal building bombing case, as a cover up and whitewash of high-level government prior knowledge, April 19, 1995. Earlier, I had been aware that FBI corruption arranged for an apparent known mobster---now get this---to be on a Federal Grand Jury for a period of time, supposedly investigating mob activities! And he leaked secret Grand Jury data for the benefit of the criminals. [The case of reputed gangster Robert Girardi, as a grand juror, in highly censored stories, Chicago Tribune, January 19 and 21, 1994.] Reportedly closely linked to the underworld, overlapping the American CIA, Arthur Andersen has been the auditor and consultants for Household International, parent of Household Bank [reputed mortgage swindlers] and Household Finance [apparent loan-sharks]. A short history. For about a decade, the American CIA operated the Nugan Hand Bank as an adjunct and proprietary, laundering political assassination and covert operations funding. Former Director of Central Intelligence, the spyshop umbrella position, was William Colby, who was General Counsel of Nugan Hand Bank. The bank operated worldwide units headed by retired U.S. Generals, black operations chieftains, and official U.S. government pirates. The bank became defunct and most of its records destroyed, after a co-
founder of the bank was found murdered in 1980. On his body was the business card of William Colby. Lots of details in the book "The Crimes of Patriots A True Story of Dope, Dirty Money, and the CIA" by Jonathan Kwitny, hardback, W.W. Norton, 1987. The successor to Nugan Hand Bank has been Household International, with units at one time in Australia, then California, London, and elsewhere. Later, their world headquarters became Prospect Heights, a Chicago suburb conveniently we claim, to a suburban airport where dope comes in from the Orient with complete immunity. [We did a television show on location about this.] William Colby was also the unlisted General Counsel of Household International, likewise a CIA adjunct and proprietary. As a supposedly "private" firm for CIA, Household is immune from disclosures by requests under the Freedom of Information Act. In retirement from CIA, Colby tended to be outspoken. He formed an espionage electronic board game, as a partnership business, with the retired head of the Soviet Secret Police, the KGB. Colby knew entirely too much first hand about Household. Colby was murdered in 1996, made to look like a supposed boating accident. His widow, a top international banking executive, knew to be silent thereafter. Colby's closest friends, interviewed by us, insist from apparent direct knowledge that he was murdered. As the secret general counsel of Household, Colby was well aware that units of Household in Arkansas reportedly laundered hundreds of millions of dollars of CIA dope trafficking loot from several southern states, including the Rockefeller bastion of Arkansas. [For Arkansas/Rockefeller details, see our website series, "Wal-Mart and the Red Chinese Secret Police".] Although starting out as a reputed "loan-sharking" operation and later apparent crooked handling of mortgages, Household's clandestine cash flood was later disguised as soybean and currency trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the Chicago Stock Exchange(formerly the scandal-ridden Midwest Stock Exchange where there had been, according to little known court records, massive misapplication of funds ostensibly overlooked by the corrupt top IRS officials in Chicago.] A whole series of little-known court cases shows, and not disputed, that Household and First National Bank of Cicero, with the connivance of Arthur Andersen brass, made 50 million dollars disappear of federal agency money. The funds were to be safeguarded, that is escrowed, by Household, to make good the long-pending claims of bank-
fraud by a Chicago-area contractor. A close family friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton, namely lawyer John E. Gierum of Park Ridge (the Chicago suburb where Hillary is from) supervised the clandestine and illegal transfer of the funds to Little Rock. From there, it was sent out of the country, to a known dope money center in the Caribbean. Congressman Dan Burton (R., Indiana) began commenting on this mysterious 50 million dollars and how Clinton, as Governor, sent it to a known dope money center. Congressional Record, May 29, 1996, pages H5627-5628. Although Burton said he has the documents and will soon put more details into the Congressional Record, someone evidently threatened him and this was his only public statement on the 50 million dollars. It was "laundered" in the Caribbean (a combination of Barbados and the Grand Cayman Islands), with the corrupt aid of Daddy Bush; Congressman Henry Hyde (R., Ill.), who is also head of CIA's "black budget", sometimes embezzled funds for political assassinations and other bloody tricks; and Ollie North [all three implicated with Bill Clinton in the CIA/dope caper through the Mena, Arkansas airport]. After thus being disguised as soybean and currency trading on the Chicago markets, the funds returned to the U.S. and were used as follows [1] 47 million dollars was used to cover up a 47 million dollar misapplication by Bill and Hillary Clinton of funds from Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan of Little Rock, the thrift owned by Jim McDougal and his estranged wife Susan. In jail, Jim was murdered to silence him as a witness against Bill and Hillary who would have been subject to federal criminal prosecution and jailing for bank embezzlement. [2] The remaining difference of the mysterious 50 million dollar theft, was three million dollars. That was used by Clinton 1992 Presidential Campaign reputed blackmailer and bagman, Rahm Emanuel. Reference to the three million dollars is in a highly censored magazine cover story about Rahm Emanuel and how he raises money for Clinton by strong-arm methods. Chicago Tribune Magazine, November 23, 1997. The three million dollars, according to the Tribune item, effectively jump-started Clinton's campaign, in November 1991, so he get ahead of others. An expert on reportedly disguising funds through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Rahm Emanuel, off and on for six years, was Clinton White House Senior Advisor. Rahm bragged on a Chicago TV Show that his desk was the closest to the door to the Oval Office. Rahm was also apparently the Acting Chief, for North America, of Israel Intelligence, The Mossad [The Institute]. Rahm has dual citizenship. The foregoing has been excerpted from various undisputed and detailed state and federal court records. Openly, he was a Clinton loyalist. But he apparently was also the spy handler of sex/spy operative Monica Lewinsky. The purpose being to blackmail and manipulate Clinton. Visit our website series on "Chandra Levy" for details. Former Enron vice-chairman, J. Clifford Baxter, was apparently "suicided" to protect the White House and Daddy Bush and his Family. This was similar to the way Clinton White House Deputy Counsel, Vincent W. Foster, Jr., was likewise "suicided" early in the Clinton Administration to prevent testimony from being available that most likely would have sent President Clinton and his wife to federal prison. Baxter's reputed "smoking gun" documents are apparently circulating in the alternative media underground. They show the numerous Enron secret partnerships relating to the following ===the laundering of part of 40 million dollars of dope trafficking funds of the Medellin Colombia dope cartel, a co-founder of which was Carlos Lehder, a business partner of the Bush Family, according to hands-tied law enforcement personnel. With the connivance of Daddy Bush, as the former head of the American Secret Political Police, Lehder's fellow co-founder, Pablo Escobar, was assassinated to protect the Bush Family from federal criminal prosecutions. ===Baxter knew about how James Baker 3rd, cabinet member in the Daddy Bush White House Administration, together with Marc Racicot [pronounced ROSS-coe] reportedly used part of the 40 million dollars of dope funds to bribe and influence southern Florida DEMOCRATS to block the vote recount. The result although Al Gore, Jr., won the popular vote nationwide by six hundred thousand votes, he lost by way of the Electoral College trick in Florida and was not inaugurated. [Visit our year 2000 Election website series, comparing the situation to the infamous 1876 Election.] ===Federal Reserve Commissar Alan Redspan [that is what we call the Dictator] siphoned off hundreds of millions of secret Enron partnership funds, multiplied through fractional reserves and derivatives hocus-pucus, to temporarily support the Dow Jones 30 Industrials. Thus for the moment saving Bush from having to deal with a financial meltdown which he most likely could not effectively deal with. Old-timers say Bush was in danger of being "Hoover-ized", referring to President Herbert Hoover, 1930-31, falsely stating "prosperity is just around the corner". The September 11 events effectively prevented for the moment Bush having to deal with a gold stampede which would tend to discredit the Federal Reserve's hot-air paper money masquerading as the "U.S. Dollar". [See part two of this Enron website series.] ===documents tending to show direct links to the Enron secret partnership funds, offshore, with George W. Bush and Richard Cheney. This might cause the downfall of the American Government as we know it. [For background, visit our website series, "The Overthrow of the American Republic".] Baxter offered to co-operate with one or more Congressional committees. His testimony, from direct personal knowledge, with his documents, would tend to destroy George W. Bush and Richard Cheney as having concealed their direct links to the massive Enron swindles. Baxter also apparently was ready to break ranks with the other Enron officials and directors, who together are defendants with Baxter in various class action pending court cases. Further, Baxter's direct knowledge and documents would tend to expose beyond salvage, Arthur Andersen as a corrupt auditing and consulting operation, that cannot be relied on to supposedly examine the books of publicly-traded firms and consult with them about their operations. Aiding the class action plaintiffs in their claims, Baxter would have broken up the otherwise united front and defense of the Enron defendants. Notice that Baxter was "suicided" in Sugarland, Texas, same location as the oil pipeline consortium had for negotiating with the top Taliban officials on behalf of Osama bin Laden. [Visit our website item, "The Pipeline Plots".] There is a half-a-loaf explanation for the demise of J. Clifford Baxter.Was Baxter done in by the American Secret Political Police like inflicted on World War Two German General Edwin Rommel by the Gestapo (for plotting against Hitler)? "You are endangering our leader. Here is a gun. Go shoot yourself. If not, we are here to shoot you. Either way, we guarantee the safety of your family." Arthur Andersen, with the apparent connivance of Enron and Marc Rich International, has caused various Archdiocese units of the Catholic Church to be swindled out of large sums of money "invested" in Enron stock and secret Enron partnerships. Among others, this includes Chicago and Milwaukee. Remember, the Catholic Archbishop of Chicago is also the Treasurer for the whole Church in the Western Hemisphere, North and South America and Central America. The funds, including that of the Vatican, through Chicago were traditionally deposited in the Continental Bank of Chicago, with major bank-owner, Chief Judge of the federal appeals court Walter Cummings, Jr., a "man of trust" for the Church. The bank was taken over by Bank of America, owned principally by the Jesuits, the French Rothschilds, and more and more, by the Japanese mafia, the Yakuza. Continental Bank and then Bank of America, has been the major secret dirty money transaction point for Marc Rich International jointly with Enron and the secret partnerships. Also, in part, through the Chicago markets. For decades, traditionally, Arthur Andersen and the Shriver lawfirm, specialized in handling Catholic Church book-keeping, so-called secret "investments", and how to operate apparently in a clandestine manner, supposedly for the good of the laity. Some consider what Arthur Andersen & Co. has apparently done to the Church, damaging them financially, is an unforgiveable violation of Church doctrine and provisions. One of those who knew a great deal about the secret partnerships, and the documents outlining the same, was Baxter who had been CEO of Enron North America, and since June 2000, chief strategy officer of Enron Corp. Are others of the Big Five Accounting firms likewise apparent vast operations, on occasion cooking the books of various companies? More coming. Stay tuned.

Feds mulling new airline surveillance system
By DAN VERTON
(February 01, 2002)
WASHINGTON -- Federal transportation security officials plan to begin
testing a new network that would enable security officials to collect and
analyze a vast array of personal data on airline passengers in an attempt to
weed out terrorists before they can get aboard aircraft.
The system would link every reservation system in the country with a number
of private and government databases. Through the use of data mining and
predictive software analysis, it would analyze personal travel histories,
unusual relationships between passengers aboard particular flights and a
wealth of other data for clues to potential threats.
A final decision on whether to move ahead with the test or deploy an
operational system has not yet been made. That decision will be made by the
Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is currently evaluating
two prototype technologies. The TSA could not be reached for comment today.
HNC Software, a San Diego-based firm that develops risk-detection software,
is leading a team of companies to build one of the two main prototypes. HNC
is working with Houston-based PROS Revenue Management Inc., which already
supplies customer analytic software to 17 of the top 25 U.S. airlines, and
Acxiom Corp., a data marketing firm in Little Rock, Ark., that collects
information on land records, car ownership, magazine subscriptions and
telephone numbers.
Joseph Firosh, executive director for research and development at HNC, said
his company's technology is currently used to detect credit card fraud in
the private sector. It is based on neural network technology that can pick
out vague relationships between data that may indicate the potential for
terrorist activity, he said.
HNC is currently talking to both the TSA and Delta Air Lines Inc. about the
feasibility of deploying the technology throughout airports, said Firosh.
"The data will have to come from the airlines, he said. "It will have to be
pooled and we will have to have a way to get the analysis to the various
checkpoints around the airports," Firosh said, indicating that if and when a
deployment decision is made, the system may require airlines to invest in
additional IT infrastructure.
Reports of the system have already raised concerns among some privacy
experts, who view the analysis of such data on all air travelers as a
potential threat to civil liberties.
Steve Kobrin, a professor at The Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia who specializes in privacy issues, said he's
concerned that such a system may "tip the balance" between security and
privacy in the wrong direction.
"Is it really necessary to track every move of every air traveler to secure
our skies?" asked Kobrin. "There is a long history of data being used for
purposes other than for which it was collected, and the potential for abuse
here is enormous."
However, Firosh said the system currently being studied will have built-in
privacy protections. "To the system, the information is just data. No human
beings will actually be looking at personal data or making ad hoc judgments
of any kind," he said. Rather, individuals will be rated on a threat scale,
and warnings will be sent electronically to authorities at screening
locations to inspect those individuals with higher threat ratings more
closely, Firosh said.
"It will all depend on how high on the scale of risk an individual is," he

How to be a KGB spy
Vasiliy Mitrokhin on the secret handbook of Russia's undercover agents
Saturday February 2, 2002
The Guardian
The KGB compiled and issued intelligence and counter-intelligence
dictionaries in the 1970s. Only officers in certain operational sub-units of
the KGB were allowed access to them.
The dictionaries, designed to provide a standard, accepted definition of
intelligence terms peculiar to the solitary and self-contained professional
world of the agencies of repression, had the legal status of regulatory
acts, binding on all units of the Soviet KGB.
Behind the quasi-scientific expressions it is possible to discern the
doctrine of permissiveness, providing a criminal legal basis for any
criminal act or constituting a recommendation to carry out such acts. The
dictionaries are the intelligence officer's book of amoral rules for
activities which jeopardise stability, the law and the social order,
providing guidance on how negative ways and means can be used to achieve
positive results. They authorise for him to do things which are forbidden by
law and to flout customary usage.

@_subject: BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGY IS THE POLICE STATE SYSTEM FOR TOTAL CONTROL 
FROM FACE SCAN CAMERAS TO THUMBSCANNERS: BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGY IS THE POLICE STATE SYSTEM FOR TOTAL CONTROL
Austin, TX ­ From fans at the Superbowl having their faces scanned to kids thumscanning to purchase lunches in the school cafeteria, Americans are being conditioned to give up their privacy and independence in exchange for the "safety" of biometrics technologies. Police departments across the country are debating the implimentation of invasive and unconstitutional Big Brother biometrics "for our safety and convenience," or, in the case of Ybor, Florida they have already instated and misused faces scanning cameras to victimize an innocent man. Across the US and the world, from Odessa, Texas to Beijing, China populations are being forced to accept the incredibly invasive technology of biometrics. Right out of the gates biometrics is being used only in Big Brother type surveillence monitoring and tracking efforts. Just imagine elementary school children in Pennsylvania who attend the Lakeside school district classes being forced to digitally fingerprint to obtain their lunches. We're talking about everybody ­ all the children ­ no cash allowed!
Two things are happening here: The children are being trained to accept a cashless society where all of their transactions are recorded and, more importantly, they are being put into Federal and State databases. In the past, only criminals were fingerprinted.
You see, we're all being treated as if we're guilty until proven innocent. In fact, Detective Todd who runs the biometric cameras in Tampa, Florida stated to the press, "I don't see the big problem with it if you don't have anything to hide." Yes, this was the mantra of Nazi Germany: "You are free to go ­ once we see your papers." Imagine what Hitler would have done with this Orwellian tool which is already being used in England to deny people to stores and sports arenas.
But it gets worse: Kroger and HEB foodstores in Texas are tearing out the "old-fashioned" checkout counters and replacing them with self-
serve scanning systems. Wells Fargo has implemented the face-scanning cameras at its banking centers in Dallas.
But where are they getting the databases to match the faces and fingerprints with names and Social Security numbers? That's right: they got them from States' drivers' license facilities. In the past eight years, State DMV's in 38 States have been collecting digital photos, thumbprints and signatures. And now, Washington DC's Mayor has announced that all the school children will be face scanned, thumbprinted and then loaded into the drivers' license database.
In one fell swoop they have put the cashless society surveillance grid in place, and they're training the children that cash will no longer get them a hamburger. Americans Against Biometrics President Alex Jones saw the threat four years ago with the drivers' license databases. He staged a 100+ person protest at the State Police offices in Austin, Texas against the biometric requirement for a driver's license. Jones was arrested after demanding that his driver's license be renewed without submitting to a digital photo and thumbprint. He had brought eight forms of ID with him, but that was not enough. It would have been enough for the KGB, but not for the Texas Department of Public Safety. The frightening video of the arrest can be viewed online at Jones became very concerned four years ago when he began to see defense contractors like Lockheed-Martin running television ads equating thumscanning to buy and sell with America's pride in the space shuttle. Biometric propaganda is everywhere in commercials and on TV: IBM and American Express show people being scanned by lasers to get their groceries; the Sci-FI channel goes out to break and comes back into the show with someone biometrically thumscanning
There are hundreds of other examples. We are all being conditioned to accept a highly centralized and dictatorial system. Is it any wonder that Red China is hastily buying up biometric technology?
Remember: right out of the gates, from the very start of this it has been mandatory to biometrically scan your body parts to get your driver's license ­ in turn to get a job and to have a bank account. Now every form of retail business and service company is deploying these systems and in hundreds of schools children are thumbscanning to get their food. We're not headed towards "1984," we're already in Radio Talk Show Host Alex Jones is the President of Americans Against Biometrics and the foremost expert on the dangers of police state biometric technology. The time to act is now: get this information out to the public so they know what they're up against. To schedule and interview with Alex Jones , please contact Violet Nichols at 512-

Monkey Moves Computer Cursor By Thoughts Alone
By E.J. Mundell NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - It may seem like science fiction, but scientists say they have developed a technology that enables a monkey to move a cursor on a computer screen simply by thinking about it. The breakthrough could someday help totally paralyzed, ''locked-in'' patients ``operate external devices such as a robot arm, or a computer to surf the Internet,'' explained researcher Daniella Meeker of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Meeker described her team's findings at a recent meeting of the Society for Neuroscience. Their work focuses on a section of the primate brain known as the posterior parietal cortex. Using high-tech brain scans, the researchers determined that small clumps of cells in this region--as few as 16--were active in the formation of the desire to carry out specific body movements. Armed with this knowledge, Meeker's group implanted sensitive electrodes in the posterior parietal cortex of a rhesus monkey trained to play a simple video game. The monkey's brain was first analyzed on high-tech MRI as it used its hand to touch dots on a touch-sensitive computer screen. ``After the monkey has done this task several times, we are able to determine, for the particular neuron, the different patterns of electrical activity when he is planning reaches in different directions,'' Meeker said. Going one step further, her team then trained the monkey to simply think about a movement, without reaching out and touching the screen. A computer program, hooked up to the implanted electrodes, interpreted the monkey's thoughts by tracking flare-ups of brain cell activity. The computer then moved a cursor on the computer screen in accordance with the monkey's desires--left or right, up or down, wherever ``the electrical (brain) pattern tells us the monkey is planning to reach,'' according to Meeker. ``In fact,'' she said, ``we found that he became quite reluctant to move his arm to the reach command once the cursor was introduced into the game. Apparently it was easier just to think about reaching.'' Speaking with Reuters Health, Meeker said her group's work differs from previous research in that it seeks to replicate the brain-motor connection ``at the level of the first inclination to make a movement.'' She added, ``This supposes that much of the downstream function--
which would be normally implemented by the rest of the brain, the spinal cord and muscles--can be relegated to intelligent machines.'' Giving completely paralyzed patients full mental control of robotic limbs or communication devices has long been a dream of those working to free such individuals from their locked-in state. ``These patients are completely paralyzed and cannot speak, yet they are fully conscious and aware,'' Meeker said. Brainstem strokes, injury to the upper spinal cord or diseases such as ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) condemn tens of thousands of patients to such an existence. ``Restoring even the most rudimentary communication or motor function to such patients will drastically improve their quality of life,'' she said. Of course, roadblocks remain and the technology remains crude. Still, Meeker said her group ``can achieve over 90% accuracy'' in carrying out the simple commands the monkey has been trained to perform so far. A technology that could replicate more complex movements--such as handwriting a letter or playing games with a robot arm--could still be years or decades away. Even more challenging are ``Terminator''-type applications that would allow the minds of healthy individuals to meld with machines--
allowing drivers to ``think'' their way through traffic, for example, or granting pilots the ability to navigate the skies with their mind. ``The largest difficulty that I see with this kind of sci-fi application is the current risk that brain surgery presents,'' Meeker said. ``This kind of technology could save the life of a locked-in patient, but has the potential to kill a healthy pilot if something went wrong.'' However, several groups are currently working to develop methods of tracking brain signals without the use of surgically implanted electrodes. Such a breakthrough could lay these types of safety concerns to rest and ``revolutionize'' the field, Meeker said. Copyright © 2002 Reuters Limited. All rights reserved.

Is Big Brother Smelling You?
A new remote sensor for auto emissions being tested in the Washington,
D.C., area could be either a tool for Big Brother or a blessing in
Supporters of the sensor call it a revolution in environmental safeguards,
but opponents fear the radar equipment is reducing personal freedom from
government surveillance.
The laser sensor, which clocks cars' emissions to determine if they are in
compliance with state standards, takes a photo image of violators' license
plates, similar to the controversial cameras already used in some areas to
bust speeders and traffic light violators.
The state of Virginia is planning a pilot program at two remote stations
along the roadways in the Washington area to test the technology and how
it would be used. If the test, planned for 2003, is successful, a full
program may be implemented in which the drivers of noxious cars would be
notified by mail that their automobiles need to be fixed.
"The least obtrusive way to maintain air quality, that's our focus," said
Bill Hayden, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Environmental
But opponents of the remote emissions tests say they are just another way
for the government to spy on its citizens, this time using the environment
to garner support for more cameras on the nation's roadways.
"They're just expanding the same photo enforcement technology and they're
going to keep expanding into more and more intrusive places," said Richard
Diamond, a spokesman for House Majority Leader Dick Armey, who has been a
vocal opponent of the red light cameras used in the D.C. suburbs of
True, the technology is not new. Developed by Donald Stedman and Gary
Bishop of the University of Denver in the early 1990's, remote sensing has
been tested and utilized in cities throughout North America, including
California, which battles one of the worst air pollution problems in the
Still the use of detection technology, including red light and speed
cameras, is a source of apoplexy for civil libertarians, who are winning
lawsuits against the cameras.
At least three courts have ruled against the use of such cameras by
municipalities in recent months. This week, a judge in Colorado shut down
the use of photo radar cameras in Denver, saying the program violated both
state and local laws. The judge dismissed the tickets of four defendants
challenging the system and the city was forced to turn off the cameras.
"The government should not be in the business of tracking its citizens
unless they are committing a crime," Diamond said in support of the
However, proponents of the cameras say traffic violators are committing
"If you are doing something that is hurtful to others, then the government
is supposed to track you and it's legitimate," said Arthur Green, chief
scientist for the free-market Reason Public Policy Institute. "If you are
driving a polluting vehicle than you are doing something wrong."
Green said the remote sensor will only track cars that are not in
compliance with the law, creating the possibility that laborious and
expensive state inspections required of every driver could come to an end.
That could be wishful thinking, however. Jim Harper, a privacy attorney
and editor of Privacilla.org, said that adding the new sensors probably
would not reduce government enforcement by other means.
"One side of this may be that they will use this to replace the
inspections  you might reduce the burden for citizens. However, the
chance that government would actually give up their inspections is slight
and this could just be adding another layer of government."
But Harper says if the government has probable cause  like emissions
violations  to take a photo of one's license plate it is not a violation
of privacy rights, as long as there is "a statutory and constitutional
guarantee" that citizens' information would be used for nothing other
keeping a statistical record of pollution in the area and to notify the
driver of their car's violations.
Diamond disagrees, and as a Virginia resident has had the personal
experience to make his case.
"I got a survey from the city of Alexandria, who said 'we know that you
were traveling at this time of the day and we wanted to ask you some
questions,' about an area construction project," he said.
Diamond said the information was taken from a traffic photo camera,
proving his point that the problem with the cameras is that they allow the
government to track citizens' movements.
The Texas American Civil Liberties Union concurs. That group called
attention to a survey issued by the Texas Transportation Institute last
summer based on the information gleaned by videotaped license plates at
five spots along the Texas borders. ACLU activists say Americans should be
protected from such intrusions.
"One thing we have in this country is freedom of movement without being
filmed and processed the entire time," Joann Bell, director of ACLU
Oklahoma Foundation, said after the survey's release.

George W. In The Garden Of Gethsemane An Open Letter to George W. Bush
Dear George, When it's all over in a couple months, and you're packing up your pretzels and Spot and heading back to Texas, what will be your biggest regret? Not getting out more often and seeing the sights around Rock Creek Park? Never once visiting the newly-renovated IKEA in Woodbridge, Virginia? Or buying your way to the White House with money from a company that committed the biggest corporate swindle in American history? I got a feeling you didn't miss much by not spending an entire Saturday afternoon assembling a Swedish bookcase --
 but you should have known that there was no way you would ever finish your term by hopping into bed with Kenneth Lay. It's kind of sad when you think about it. Here you were -- the most popular president ever! -- the recipient of so much good will from your fellow Americans after September 11, and then you had to go and blow it. You just couldn't stay away from your old cowpoke friend from Texas, Kenneth Lay. Kenny has always been there for you. You needed a way to fly around to all the primaries and campaign stops in the 2000 election -- so Kenny gave you his corporate jet. Did you tell the voters when you arrived in each city that the bird you flew in on was from a billionaire who was secretly conspiring to give the bird to all his employees and investors? He flew you around America on the Enron company jet, and for that favor you touched down on tarmac after tarmac to tell your fellow citizens that you were "going to restore dignity to the White House, the people's house." You said this standing in front of an Enron jet! Man, you loved Lay so much, you not only affectionately referred to him as "Kenny Boy," you interrupted an important campaign trip in April, 2000, to fly back to Houston for the Astro's opening day at the new Enron Field -- just so you could watch Kenny Boy Lay throw out the first pitch. How sentimental! I mean, you loved this man so intensely that, when you were awarded a set of keys the Supreme Court had made for you so you could live in the White House, you invited Kenny Boy to set up shop -- at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue! He interviewed those who would hold high-level Energy Department positions in your administration. You not only let Kenny Boy decide who would head the regulatory agency that oversaw Enron, you let him hand-pick the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Harvey Pitt -- a former lawyer for his accountant, Arthur Andersen! Kenny and the boys at Andersen also worked to make sure that accounting firms would be exempt from numerous regulations and would not be held liable for any "funny bookkeeping" (don't you wish you were this forward-
thinking?). The rest of Kenny Boy's time was spent next door with his old buddy, Dick Cheney (Enron and Halliburton, as you'll recall, got the big contracts from your dad to "rebuild" Kuwait after the Gulf War). Lay and Dick formed an "energy task force" (Operation Enduring Graft) which put together the county's new "energy policy." This policy then went on to shut down every light bulb and juicer in the state of California. And guess who made out like bandits while "trading" the energy California was in desperate need of? Kenny Boy and Enron! No wonder Big Dick doesn't want to turn over the files about those special meetings with Lay! The only thing that surprises me more than all the Enron henchmen who ended up in your cabinet and administration is how our lazy media just rolled over and didn't report it. The list of Enron people on your payroll is impressive. Lawrence Lindsey, your chief economic advisor? A former advisor at Enron! Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill? Former CEO of Alcoa, whose lobbying firm, Vinson and Elkins, was the  contributor to the your campaign! Who is Vinson and Elkins? The law firm representing Enron! Who is Alcoa? The top polluter in Texas. Timothy White, the Secretary of the Army? A former vice-chair of Enron Energy! Robert Zoellick, your Federal Trade Representative? A former advisor at Enron! Karl Rove, your main man at the White House? He owned a quarter-million dollars of Enron stock. Then there's the Enron lawyer you have nominated to be a federal judge in Texas, the Enron lobbyist who is your chair of the Republican Party, the two Enron officials who now work for House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, and the wife of Texas Senator Phil Gramm who sits on Enron's board. And there's the aforementioned Mr. Pitt, the former Arthur Andersen attorney whose job it is now as SEC head to oversee the stock markets. George, it never stops! My fingers are getting tired typing all this up -- and there's lots more. Don't get me wrong, George -- I do not think you're an evil man. You don't need any crap from people like me -- heck, you got mother-in-
law problems! Now, I have a very good relationship with my mother-in-
law, but then, I never told her to put $8,000 of her money into a company my administration knew was going belly-up. You say you didn't know? Your bag man -- Don Evans, the man who squeezed all that money for you from Enron as your campaign finance chairman (and is now collecting his reward as your Commerce Secretary) -- has admitted that he got calls from Enron begging for help last year because they were going under. Didn't he tell you this? Then Paul O'Neill, your Treasury Secretary, admitted that Enron and Kenny Boy called him, too, for some special favors to save Enron. Didn't he mention this to you? They claim to have called your chief of staff, Andrew Card, and he said he didn't bother to inform you. What does your mother-in-law think about these boys her daughter's husband consorts with? I love watching the O'Neill and Evans show. What a couple of cut-ups! They're, like, all proud of themselves for "not doing Enron any favors." Actually, I think it's more like they didn't do your MOTHER-
IN-LAW any favors. Enron got LOTS of favors. And why not? Kenny Boy has been your number one financial backer since you ran for governor. No other American or Saudi has given you more money than Kenny Boy and his gang at Enron. O'Neill, Evans, Cheney, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham -- ALL of them gave Lay and Enron special favors from day one. The New York Times last May was so concerned about how Kenny had the run of the place (1600 Pennsylvania Ave.), they referred to Lay as the "shadow advisor to the president." And what advice! Who was it that wanted you to deregulate the energy industry further? Kenny Boy! Who was it that convinced you to explore the sick idea of PRIVATIZING our water supply and then allow private corporations to "trade" it in the future? Kenny Boy! Who was it that wanted Social Security to be tied to the stock market? Yup, Kenny Boy! (Imagine, if you will, what would have happened to our precious Social Security funds had they been invested in Enron stocks as you, George, suggested be done during your campaign as yuppies everywhere clucked along in agreement over that genius idea.) O'Neill's and Evans's admission that they "did nothing" when Enron told them of the company's shell game and impending collapse is reason enough for you and yours to hit the Beltway and never return to that sacred trust we call Our American Government. They are proud of "doing nothing?" By doing nothing, millions of Americans have been swindled. Tens of thousands have lost their jobs. Thousands more have lost their savings and their retirement. Yet your cabinet secretaries gloat over what a "good job" you and they did by "doing nothing." Let me ask you this: If someone was setting a house on fire, and they called you to help them set it on fire, and you said no you wouldn't help them -- BUT then you also DIDN'T call 911 and inform the police that someone was going to burn down a house, do you think you would have committed a crime? Of course you would have! You had prior knowledge and then you knowingly and purposefully HID this information from the authorities and the people living in the house! You only admitted that you knew a house was going to be torched when you were confronted by the police. Are you complicit? Yes! Are you an accessory? Yes! Who would even think of going around boasting, "Hey, look what a great guy I am -- a friend of mine told me he was going to commit an act of arson, and then I decided NOT to tell ANYONE about it!! WHOO-HOO!!" Enron and Kenny Boy bought your silence and the silence of your cabinet members. You yourself didn't have to actually raid the 401(k) accounts of those poor people in Houston (many of whom probably voted for you every time your name was on a ballot). All you had to do was remain silent, change the government regulations that let them get away with it, and install their hand-picked cronies to sit on the "oversight" boards which were supposed to be keeping an eye on them. While doing all this, you told the American people that these rich friends of yours were not getting any special breaks -- when, in fact, Enron had already scammed their way out of paying NO taxes in four out of the last five years. Your economic "stimulus" bill that you got the House to pass after 9-11 had a section that would give Enron a gift of $250 million of our tax money. You were pushing this bill in November and December, long after your administration knew that Enron was raiding the vault and screwing its workers and investors. You and your Republican friends are quick to point out that Enron had their claws into the Democrats as well. Yes, they did, and thank you for making the case why we not only need an alternative to the current make-up of the Democratic Party, we need private money removed from our electoral process ASAP. But, George, let's be real -- the Democrats only got a pittance from Enron compared to the millions you and the Republicans received. Democrats just don't have the killer instinct to do anything right, and they certainly don't know much about making money the old-
fashioned way, one off-shore tax shelter at a time. I would expect nothing less from a Party that couldn't even put their candidate in the White House after he had already won the election. The Democrats are like a Yugo -- you know it won't last long or work well, but it will occasionally get the job done. Fat cats know they can buy the Democrats at discount prices, and so they do. Anyone who tries to deflect this scandal away from you, George, or away from the Republicans, or away from the whole dirty way we elect our leaders, is someone who is desperately trying to cling to what's left of a very crooked system that has to go and go now. The saddest part of this whole affair was the day the scandal was revealed -- and you denied that you even knew your good friend, Kenneth Lay. "Ken who?" you said. Oh, he's just some businessman from Texas. "Heck, he backed my opponent for governor, Ann Richards!" was your way of trying to deflect the truth that was hitting you like a Mack truck. You knew that he, in fact, endorsed YOU and gave you THREE times the money Ann Richards ever saw from him. I hardly ever talk to the guy, you said. You were like Peter outside the walls of Herod after they grabbed J.C. from the Garden of Gethsemane. Three times he denied he knew Jesus, and three times the cock crowed. But Peter, unlike you, felt shame and wept, and then ran away. What shame do you feel tonight, George, for the lies you have told? What shame do you feel using the dead of 9-11 as a cover for your actions, hoping that our sorrow for those lost souls and our fear of being killed by terrorists would distract us from what your boys and Kenny Boy were up to during those horrific weeks in September and October? It was during those very days, while the rest of us were in shock and sadness, that the executives at Enron were selling off their stock and shifting assets to their 900 phony partnerships overseas. Did they notice the remains of the dead being pulled from the rubble while they were downloading their millions, or were their eyes glued only to the bottom third of the TV screen as the stock ticker with the rigged Enron price crawled across the images of firemen desperate, in tears, to find their fallen brothers? The country was behind you when you said you were fighting the evildoers who did this. In fact, all the while, the real fight your friends at Enron were conducting was the fight against the clock, to see how fast they could transfer all the loot to their personal accounts and run away. Those were the evildoers, George, and you knew it. And because you, by design or negligence, allowed this to happen, it is time for you to resign. The cock has crowed for the last time. At the very least, your mother-in-law deserves better. Yours, Michael Moore American Son-in-Law Owner of 7th LARGEST COMPANY IN AMERICA!

@_subject: 16th Amendment Never Ratified 
Sent: Friday, January 25, 2002 11:19 PM
      16th AMENDMENT NEVER RATIFIED
      The Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States was
never ratified by a majority of the sovereign States.
      This is the Amendment that allegedly entitled the Federal Agent
(government) in the federal territory of Washington, D.C. and their
private collection company, the IRS, to collect "income tax" as falsely
declared to be ratified in February 1913.
       After an exhaustive year long search of legislative records in 48
sovereign states (Alaska & Hawaii were not admitted into the Union until
after 1913), Bill Benson wrote his fact findings in The Law That Never
Was, Vols. 1 & 2. He was able to unequivocally prove that the 16th
Amendment was never Constitutionally, properly, or legally ratified. The
only record of the 16th Amendment having been confirmed was a proclamation
made by the Secretary of State Philander Knox on February 25, 1913,
wherein he simply declared it to be "in effect", but never stating it was
lawfully ratified.
      Even if the 16th Amendment were properly ratified, according to
Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, it has always been
unconstitutional for the U.S. Federal Government to directly tax We the
People in their property, wages, salaries, or earnings. The judges of the
U.S. Supreme Court rejected any claims that the 16th Amendment changed the
constitutional limits on direct taxes in Brushaber v. Union Pacific R.R.
Co., 240 U.S. 1, when they ruled that it "created no new power of
taxation" and that it "did not change the constitutional limitations which
forbid any direct taxation of individuals".
      Alleged defects in the ratification of the Income Tax Amendment
      According to the investigations of Bill Benson and others, the
following defects were found in the ratification of the Income Tax
Amendment by the 48 states then existing, three-fourths or 36 of which
were needed to ratify it:
            01 - Not ratified by state legislature, and so reported
            02 - Not ratified by state legislature, but reported as ratified
            03 - Missing or incomplete evidence of ratification, but reported as ratified
            04 - Failure of Governor or other official to sign, although required by State Constitution
            05 - Other violation of State Constitution in ratification process             06 - Other procedural irregularity making ratification doubtful             07 - Approval, but with change in wording, accepted as ratification of original version             08 - Approval, but with change in spelling, accepted as ratification of original version             09 - Approval, but with change in capitalization, accepted as ratification of original version             10 - Approval, but with change in punctuation, accepted as ratification of original version             State            01            02            03            04            05            06            07            08            09            10             Alabama            1            1            1             Arizona            1            1            1            1             Arkansas            1            1            1            1            1             California            1            1            1            1            1             Colorado            1            1            1            1             Connecticut            1             Delaware            1             Florida            1             Georgia            1            1            1            1            1             Idaho            1            1            1            1            1            1             Illinois            1            1            1             Indiana            1            1            1             Iowa            1            1            1             Kansas            1            1             Kentucky            1            1            1            1            1            1            1             Louisiana            1            1            1            1             Maine            1            1             Maryland            1            1            1             Massachusetts            1            1            1            1             Michigan            1            1            1            1            1             Minnesota            1            1             Mississippi            1            1            1            1            1            1             Missouri            1            1            1            1            1             Montana            1            1            1            1             Nebraska            1            1             Nevada            1            1            1             New Hampshire            1             New Jersey            1            1            1             New Mexico            1            1             New York            1            1            1             North Carolina            1            1             North Dakota            1            1             Ohio            1            1             Oklahoma            1            1            1             Oregon            1            1             Pennsylvania            1             Rhode Island            1             South Carolina            1            1            1            1             South Dakota            1            1            1            1            1             Tennessee            1            1            1            1            1             Texas            1            1            1            1            1            1             Utah            1             Vermont            1            1            1            1            1             Virginia            1             Washington            1            1            1            1            1             West Virginia            1            1            1             Wisconsin            1            1            1             Wyoming            1            1            1            1            1            1             Total            7            3            9            6            25            29            22            1            31            27             Additional            7            3            7            5            16            6            2            0            2            0             Accumulated            7            10            17            22            38            44            46            46            48            48       In the above table, the line "Additional" are the number of states for which that defect is in addition to previously indicated defects, and "Accumulated" is a running total of states with defects, from Defect 01 through 10.       Since 36 states were required to ratify, the failure of 13 to ratify would be fatal to the amendment, and this occurs within the first three defects, arguably the most serious. Even if we were to ignore defects of spelling, capitalization, and punctuation, we would still have only two states which successfully ratified.       Note that in the above we are counting Ohio as a state, even though it was not admitted into the Union until 1953 (retroactively, which is ex post facto, and unconstitutional). We are not counting the failure to designate the Income Tax Amendment as the "XVII" amendment, since there was arguably a 13th Amendment that was ratified but which is not published in official copies of the Constitution with Amendments, and the number is not necessarily part of the amendment (It wasn't part of the first 10.).       The authority usually cited for the criticality of ratification without errors of spelling, capitalization, or punctuation, is from DOCUMENT NO. 97-120, of the 97TH CONGRESS, 1st Session, entitled How Our Laws Are Made, written by Edward F. Willett, Jr. Esq., Law Revision Counsel of the United States House of Representatives, in which the comparable exactitude in which bills must be concurred under federal legislative rules is detailed:       . . Each amendment must be inserted in precisely the proper place in the bill, with the spelling and punctuation exactly the same as it was adopted by the House. Obviously, it is extremely important that the Senate receive a copy of the bill in the precise form in which it passed the House. The preparation of such a copy is the function of the enrolling clerk. (at 34) (emphasis added)       When the bill has been agreed to in identical form by both bodies (either without amendment by the Senate, or by House concurrence in the Senate amendments, or by agreement in both bodies to the conference report) a copy of the bill is enrolled for presentation to the President.       The preparation of the enrolled bill is a painstaking and important task since it must reflect precisely the effect of all amendments, either by deletion, substitution, or addition, agreed to by both bodies. The enrolling clerk... must prepare meticulously the final form of the bill, as it was agreed to by both Houses, for presentation to the President...  each (amendment) must be set out in the enrollment exactly as agreed to, and all punctuation must be in accord with the action taken. (at 45) (emphasis added)       It should be noted that in his report on ratifications of the Income Tax Amendment to then Secretary of State Philander Knox, the Solicitor of the Department of State, recognized many of the defects of wording, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation, although he seemed ignorant of the constitutional and procedural defects at the state level. He also pointed out similar defects in the ratifications of the 14th and 15th Amendments. Therefore, Knox had plenty of clues to the problems in the ratifications, sufficient to justify that he inquire into the matter further and demand corrective action by the states. Because he failed to do so means that we now have adopted and enforced legislation for more than 80 years that is plainly unconstitutional, requiring not only that it be repealed, but that all the funds collected be refunded.       The states could, of course, re-ratify the Income Tax Amendment, but they could not do so retroactively. That would allow re-enactment of the Internal Revenue Code, and re-issuance of all the supporting regulations, but none of them could apply to the period prior to proper ratification of the amendment and due notices of the regulations.       Readers are invited to independently confirm or refute these results and to similarly investigate the ratifications of other constitutional amendments, both at the federal and state levels, and to issue similar reports on what they find.

Reply-To: "Political News & Views and Jewish \"National\" Identity As you know, he's listed an "evil axis" as including
Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.
The situation with Iran and Iraq deserve their own
separate posts.  As for North Korea, on Wednesday
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that
the U.S. had for many years been "quite nicely and
diplomatically" offering invitations to meet with
North Korean officials, but those overtures were
ultimately rejected.
Has Mr. Boucher forgotten so quickly that under
President Clinton, in his last months in office,
relations with North Korea had reached a high point,
so encouraging that then Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright visited Pyongyang.  The visit was significant
in that Albright was the highest level U.S. official
to travel to North Korea. Her visit was right on the
heels of the landmark Pyongyang summit between the
North and South Korean leaders (Kim Dae-jung and Kim
Jong Il).  We had reason to hope for a final peace
deal between the two countries.  All part of the peace
and prosperity we enjoyed for eight years.
Then, along came Bush, swaggering his way into the
White House with his braggadacio talk of reverting to
tougher lines with North Korea, and lo, North Korea
broke off official contacts with not only Washington
but Seoul as well.
THAT's what happened to President Clinton's successes
on the Korean peninsula.
This man thinks war is all a game.  He regards our
young men as little tin soldiers he can play with.
Ever play the boardgame "Risk"?  I play it with my
little boy sometimes, and I can wipe out an entire
country with a roll of the dice and feel nothing but
glee.  I freeze to think that this man is in search of
THAT kind of adrenal skyrocket.
If we ever manage to get really united and begin
exposing the lies of the past year, let's be sure to
include this one.  Any man of his instability, with
such a love of playing war, is inevitably going to be
drawn into an obsessive curiosity about dropping a
nuclear (nuke-you-lar) bomb.
God!  How DID it happen?

"You not only let Kenny Boy decide who would head the regulatory agency that oversaw Enron, you let him hand-pick the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Harvey Pitt -- a former lawyer for his accountant, Arthur Andersen! Kenny and the boys at Andersen also worked to make sure that accounting firms would be exempt from numerous regulations and would not be held liable for any "funny bookkeeping" ....Kenny Boy has been your number one financial backer since you ran for governor. No other American or Saudi has given you more money than Kenny Boy and his gang at Enron."
"At least three top White House advisers involved in drafting President Bush's energy strategy held stock in the Enron Corporation or earned fees from the large Texas-based energy trading company, which lobbied aggressively to shape the administration's approach to energy issues." "An estimated 3,000 partnerships, some with names of "Star Wars" characters such as Jedi, were created by Enron -- which took a 97 percent stake in each of them and brought in outside investors for the remainder. The partnerships were kept off Enron's books and helped create the accounting debacle that pushed the company into the biggest U.S. corporate bankruptcy ever on Dec. 2." "George W. in the Garden of Gethsemane"
An Open Letter to George W. Bush from Michael Moore
You needed a way to fly around to all the primaries and campaign stops in the 2000 election -- so Kenny gave you his corporate jet. Did you tell the voters when you arrived in each city that the bird you flew in on was from a billionaire who was secretly conspiring to give the bird to all his employees and investors? He flew you around America on the Enron company jet, and for that favor you touched down on tarmac after tarmac to tell your fellow citizens that you were "going to restore dignity to the White House, the people's house." You said this standing in front of an Enron jet! Man, you loved Lay so much, you not only affectionately referred to him as "Kenny Boy," you interrupted an important campaign trip in April, 2000, to fly back to Houston for the Astros opening day at the new Enron Field -- just so you could watch Kenny Boy Lay throw out the first pitch.....when you were awarded a set of keys the Supreme Court had made for you so you could live in the White House, you invited Kenny Boy to set up shop -- at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue!

You not only let Kenny Boy decide who would head the regulatory agency that oversaw Enron, you let him hand-pick the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Harvey Pitt -- a former lawyer for his accountant, Arthur Andersen!

January 31, 2002  Senator Says Enron Not Cooperating With Investigation By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  Filed at 3:43 p.m. ET WASHINGTON (AP) -- Enron Corp. has failed to provide a Senate committee with important information about a web of partnerships used to conceal massive debts, a senator leading an investigation said Thursday.  Enron officials "just simply have not cooperated" in providing the documents sought, said Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., chairman of a Senate Commerce subcommittee. "We again renew our request."  An estimated 3,000 partnerships, some with names of "Star Wars" characters such as Jedi, were created by Enron -- which took a 97 percent stake in each of them and brought in outside investors for the remainder.

TRADING TRUTH: A REPORT ON HARVARD'S ENRON ENTANGLEMENTS
(Summary and Recommendations) A HARVARDWATCH REPORT January 31, 2002
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
QUESTIONABLE FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND INTERLOCKING
Herbert "Pug" Winokur is a member of the Harvard Corporation, the
university's seven-member self-selecting governing body, and a longtime
member of the Board of Directors at Enron Corporation. He is currently the
chair of the board's Finance Committee. In this capacity Winokur
reportedly approved the creation of more than 3,000 partnerships and
subsidiaries which were allegedly used by Enron to hide debt and avoid
taxation. Winokur's position on the board's Finance Committee gave him
unique access to Enron's financial structure and should have alerted him
to the company's imminent collapse. During the period in which Enron
executives touted the company's stock to employees, Harvard's main private
investment fund â Highfields Capital âshort-sold several million
shares of Enron stock for an estimated profit of $50 million.  Mr.
Winokur's leadership positions at Enron and Harvard raise questions
regarding Highfields' massive short-selling transactions, which benefited
the Harvard endowment. There has been insufficient investigation into the
possibility that Highfields operated with inside information when it
short-sold millions of Enron shares.

Bush Touts Anti-Terror Umbrella
Fri Feb 1, 3:22 AM ET
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON (AP) - "Fight on, America," President Bush exhorts. To him, the
fight against terrorism is joined on every front now, with no end in
It's not just on battlefields or at border crossings but in schools,
neighborhoods and homes, where he says teaching children, loving them and
helping others are weapons to ward off the evil ones.
Bearing America's mighty grievance born in September, flush with
confidence from military progress and enjoying sky-high public support,
the Republican president is on a roll even by the reckoning of Democrats.
Yet there are voices, few at home, more abroad, wondering whether Bush is
going a little too far with the apocalyptic war talk.
"In rhetoric there's an impulse to repeat what works," said Kathleen Hall
Jamieson, an authority in presidential words and dean of the Annenberg
School for Communication in Philadelphia. "At a certain point, people
realize it's being overworked."
With Bush promoting everything short of eating your spinach as central to
the war on terrorism, she said, "he is beginning to stretch here toward
the edge of plausibility."
Few question the seriousness of the terrorist threat, a danger underscored
with increasing gravity in the last few days.
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld warned Thursday of possible attacks
"vastly more deadly" than those of Sept. 11.
But U.S. saber-rattling, such as Bush's assertion Thursday that countries
that do not share American values "better get their house in order,"
spread nervousness abroad even among allies.
Increasingly in recent weeks and most dramatically in his State of the
Union speech and after it, Bush has brought diverse matters under the
umbrella of the anti-terror war, the area where he is politically
unassailable at home.
_Economic growth has become economic "security."
_The drug war is crossing paths with the terror war; the White House is
sponsoring two Super Bowl commercials telling people that buying drugs
could line the pockets of terrorists.
_Bush is advocating cultural change - away from the "If it feels good, do
it" ethos - as a means of fortifying the nation in the struggle of good
and evil.
_Education is no longer just a way to improve a child, a school or a
community - something to do on its own merits.
"We're looking for teachers," he told Floridians in a pitch for retired
educators to help needy children. "And by doing so, we stand square in the
face of evil. We tell the enemy, 'You can't get us.'"
Probably not since Ronald Reagan have Americans seen a president so
lacking in relativism. "We're fighting evil," he says, "and I don't see
any shades of gray."
Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California was a blunt if practically
lone voice of semi-dissent after Bush's State of the Union speech.
"Basically, he's played the war for whatever it's worth," she said.
For the most part, Democrats are trying to carve out areas of domestic
policy where they can take on Bush while heaping him with praise as the
commander in chief.
So far, Bush, devoting himself to a struggle that may outlast his
presidency, has kept attention riveted on the war and his expansive
definition of it.
The alarms from the administration grew louder by the day this week,
although the facts behind them were not always solid.
First, White House officials warned in TV appearances before Bush's speech
that up to 100,000 "terrorist killers" had been trained in the Afghan
Later, away from the cameras and under condition of anonymity, one senior
official clarified the claim, putting the estimate of terrorists actually
trained by al-Qaida where it had been before - 15,000 to 20,000. Bush
settled on "tens of thousands" in his speech.
On Thursday, Rumsfeld said adversaries may strike with ever more dangerous
weapons. He was referring in part to missiles from countries such as North
Korea, Iran and Iraq - the states Bush starkly described as an "axis of
Appropriating the language of combat for domestic ends is not new in a
country that has tried to wage war on poverty, drugs, illiteracy and more.
But Bush means it literally.
"There are ways to fight terror other than wearing a uniform," he said.
"People say, 'Well, gosh, I want to be part of the war against terror.'
And my answer is, love somebody; be a good mother or dad."
Even the wartime titan Franklin Roosevelt was dealing in analogy when he
asked Congress for power to "wage a war against the emergency."
The foe at hand, that day in 1933, was the Depression, not the Axis.

STATE OF THE EMPIRE
we will fight the world's evil!
By Dorothy Anne Seese: 01.31.02
Just to make certain that the president said what my ears thought they
heard, the news sites conveniently furnished a copy of President Bush's
State of the Union address. Sure enough, we're taking on all the world's
evil. That would be a noble, almost messianic task -- were it not for the
fact that we, our nation and our leadership -- are viewed by a large
portion of the world as being part of that evil. Even we in America
realize that our government, our multinational corporations and huge
foundations have fostered the demise of true freedom in America. Thus when
the president speaks of "freedom" it is immediately a question as to
whether or not he is speaking of a redefined freedom, rather than the
freedoms for which our forefathers lived, sacrificed and died.
It is apparent that war, or the semblance of war, will continue
indefinitely. That makes sense because evil will continue indefinitely, or
until the Final Judgment comes to abolish all evil. We in America were not
appointed to that task ... at least not in any definable document or
anointing of which we are aware.
The news analysts who spoke after the address agreed that this State of
the Union speech was more a war speech than the usual SU speech given by
the president. Little was said of domestic problems, except for the
emphasis on federalized education, a tool of destruction for
individualistic thinking and the inculcation of globalistic definitions.
Scant mention was made of we seniors, other than the usual repeat of
pre-election "stuff" about choices between food and medicine. That was a
nice token but meaningless.
What we heard, behind the words or between the lines, was that we're now
in an indefinite state of military preparedness for war at home and
abroad. Wartime brings about the abrogation of civil rights and domestic
And woe be to the group that challenges the constitutionality of what is
planned for an America in a state of war-in-perpetuity!
Setting aside the hear-ye rhetoric, the speech was actually a declaration
of indefinite expansion of government and its power over the rights and
privileges of individual citizens.
No wonder there were so many smiles from Democrats! This is precisely what
they have been trying to get across since Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency,
and decades before that if one considers the long-term agenda of the
elitists and advocates of the New World Order.
President Bush named some terrorist states such as Iran and Iraq, and
notably omitted whatever obligation the United States may have to stopping
the genocide in South Africa or Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Notice was thus given
to the nations against whom this country will take wartime measures to
ensure that "evil" is erased from their borders, and perhaps the borders
along with the evils.
Globalism advanced two decades this evening with the president's agenda.
Right-wing Christian Republicans, Libertarians, Constitutionalists and
Reformers could not have heard much, if anything, that would build this
president's conservative base. We need to withdraw from global meddling
and concentrate on America. That, we did not hear.
The president stated that he is a proud member of his political party ...
the Republican party. Yet there was nothing in this address that spoke of
the type of Republicanism espoused by the late Barry Goldwater in the
1950's and 1960's or the type now being maintained by Rep. Ron Paul
Who's at war? Congress has declared none. If someone has declared war
against the US, it is not a nation state but an ephemeral movement. Thus
the wartime status of our nation has to be in perpetuity or until the
globalist agenda is accomplished. Anyone who did not hear that, is not
aware of what globalism means. It is not trading with other nations.
Noticeably absent from the president's speech was any mention of China. It
was implicit, perhaps, because China engages in its own type of terrorism
and has done so while maintaining friendly governmental relations with the
US (in spite of the April 2001 reconnaissance plane incident) and China is
a known enemy of the US. Their record on human rights is an abomination to
any God-fearing people, but there don't seem to be many of those around in
the 21st century ... all is compromise, tolerance, diversity and unity.
That's the agenda in a nutshell.
President Bush's speech was smoother than anything Orwell could have
written, because Big Brother would have given himself away, and to the
average American listener to the network news, this speech sounded
impressive, but it was imperialistic.
George W. Bush is a lot better at what he does than was his father.
This writer would be the last to call George W. Bush a fool, he is
incredibly sensitive to what it takes to rally the people to his cause.
he just sold the American public at large on a war that doesn't exist, a
wartime strategy for globalism under the imperialist military of the
States in the name of fighting evil, and of sacrificing more freedoms to
attain his desired results. That is no mean feat.
That is why what we heard was a State of the Empire address.
The president lacked only a marble podium, a toga and the garland of the
Caesars around his head.
Novus ordo seculorum.

Back Microsoft and win an iPaq
By John Lettice
Posted: 29/01/2002 at 14:08 GMT
Back Redmond and win an iPaq? Strange but true, this was indeed the offer made to a select mailing list of likely Microsoft supporters by lobbying group Americans for Technology Leadership, according to an AP report today. The offer was made in a mailshot to attendees of this week's Conservative Political Action Conference, a likely bastion of Microsoft supporters if ever we've seen one.
ATL, it appears, is utterly unabashed by the matter, with executive director Jim Prendergast arguing that the iPaq is just a tool to get people involved, and certainly not a bribe. ATL has been soliciting pro-Microsoft letters as part of the public comment process on the proposed MS-DoJ settlement. Comment on the subject had to be with the DoJ by yesterday, and the DoJ now has 30 days to publish it in the Federal Register (no relation).
'Publish' may however be something of an exagerration. During the trial years when it wanted Microsoft to look bad the DoJ merrily (if somewhat bulkily) posted PDFs of practically everything, but now it seems not to be inclined to go any further than the bare legal minimum of Federal Register publication. But as the Federal Register itself has an online presence, we shouldn't consider the comment entirely buried.
Although the deadline for comment has now expired, ATL's site (which, humorously, seems not to work with The Register's copy of Opera) was still soliciting comment today. No mention of iPaqs in the online form however, you'll be saddened to hear. ATL describes itself as "a broad-based coalition of technology professionals, consumers, and organizations dedicated to limiting government regulation of Its founding members include Microsoft, Staples, CompUSA, usual suspects the Association for Competitive Technology and Citizens Against Government Waste, the Small Business Survival Committee, the 60Plus Association (Conservative Grey Panthers for Redmond?), and a couple of Microsoft partners. It's difficult to figure out what it is the other founder, Cityscape Filmworks, does, but we note that it managed to put in an appearance at an ACT "career program" as part of a national "Techies Day" last October.

Behind the Headlines
by Justin Raimondo
February 1, 2002
NEVER MIND OSAMA
Let's conquer the world instead
President Bush's State of the Union speech confirms what we have long
maintained on this website: the "war on terrorism" is not a defensive
operation, but a war of conquest. In the wake of 9/11, we endorsed a
limited police action narrowly aimed at getting the perpetrators and
bringing them to justice: the title of my column, "Kill 'Em  and Get
Out!" pretty much summed up our editorial position. It is clear,
after listening to the President threaten the so-called Axis of Evil,
that the US is no longer fighting a just war, if it ever was. After
all the railing and ranting against Osama bin Laden, Bush did not
mention his name once, and only alluded to the Evil One indirectly
when he gloated over how the terrorist leaders are "on the run." It
looks like the US government has pretty much lost sight of OBL  and
they're hoping the American people will do the same.
THE GREAT DIVERSION
It's instructive  and not surprising to libertarians  that the one legitimate goal of this war, getting Osama and wiping out Al Qaeda  has been thoroughly botched. Everything but that has been accomplished: we have ove
rthrown the Taliban, brought Pakistan and India to the brink of thermonuclear meltdown, and alienated our oldest allies in the region, the Saudis. Kites are once again flying in Kabul  but where's Osama? The US governmen
t couldn't care less: instead of capturing or killing this monster (and bringing America's holy crusade to a premature end) they are much more concerned with widening the war to include the oil-rich regions of the Middle
TWO THUMBS DOWN
Despite the huzzahs from the President's amen corner  which now include Democrats as well as Republicans when it comes to foreign policy  as propaganda Bush's speech was remarkably dull and unconvincing. He started out
touting our glorious victory, celebrating the ignominious defeat of a bunch of bedraggled half-civilized tribesmen by the mightiest army on earth: we not only "rallied a great coalition," he declared, but also
"Captured, arrested and rid the world of thousands of terrorists, destroyed Afghanistan's terrorist training camps, saved a people from starvation and freed a country from brutal oppression."
As if the outcome was ever in doubt  and the warlords hadn't already started shooting at each other. Never has there been so much chest-pounding bravado and triumphalist hysteria over so little. When Caesar subdued the G
auls, he didn't make half as much noise about it. Okay, then, so we won: mission accomplished, over and out. Ah, but not so fast
WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN
We are told that thousands of terrorists  Bush says as many as 100,000  are roaming the earth, with but one thought in mind: to target America:
"What we have found in Afghanistan confirms that, far from ending there, our war against terror is only beginning. Most of the 19 men who hijacked planes on September the 11th were trained in Afghanistan's camps. And so w
ere tens of thousands of others. Thousands of dangerous killers, schooled in the methods of murder, often supported by outlaw regimes, are now spread throughout the world like ticking time bombs, set to go off without war
BUSH'S BLANK CHECK
Bush wants a blank check, and, unfortunately, Americans have been frightened into giving it to him  a decision we will all live to regret. The idea that we discovered all these secret terrorist plans, just laying around
right out in the open, strains credulity, but then Americans are not inclined these days to examine the evidence too closely, even if it were readily available. Given the alleged scale of the danger we face  a horde of 1
00,000 barbarians, all clamoring to get into the imperial metropolis  how is it that we've just now started examining all airline luggage? Where are the checkpoints, the armed guards, the tanks in the streets? If Bush's
numbers are even remotely true, then calling for a moratorium on all immigration would be the least he could do. Yet it hasn't happened.
DOWN THE MEMORY HOLE
There's something awfully phony about a "war on terrorism" where the terrorist-in-chief, Osama bin Laden, is dropped down the Memory Hole and new hate objects  Iraq, Iran, North Korea, aka The Axis of Evil  suddenly loo
m large. It's bad enough that the nation with the biggest and deadliest war arsenal is now inveighing against "weapons of mass destruction," but to top it off Bush points an accusing finger at the pitiful and near-collaps
ing regime of North Korea, where the half-mad son of the late Great Leader presides over a nation of bark-eating concentration camp victims. If Osama is hiding out in Pyongyang, he's going to get plenty of roughage.
NO ONE IS SAFE
No evidence links Iraq, or Iran for that matter, to the events of 9/11. To say nothing of North Korea. But anyone who thinks this war is about 9/11 any longer isn't paying attention. It's a power grab, pure and simple, a
war in which not even our allies in the region are safe. The other day, Bush's conservative fan club over at National Review came out in an editorial for the conquest of the Saudi oil fields. Complaining that the Saudis m
ay be asking us to quit our bases their, the editors of NR opine that this would be such a "stinging blow to American prestige" and provide the terrorists with such "vindication," that therefore,
"The House of Saud will have sided with the militants, and America will therefore have to do all it can to overthrow it. For years, the U.S. has maintained a presence in Saudi Arabia to prevent the massive oil fields ther
e from being taken over by a hostile power. Too late."
THE GRABBERS
It is a stunning feature of post-9/11 irrationalism that such a statement could be seriously made by the editors of a reputable periodical, conservative or liberal, without much explication, and still be considered in the
 "mainstream." To define the Saudis as a "hostile power" having "taken over" their own country is typical of our nutty neo-imperialist mindset: what's frightening is that, with this State of the Union speech, the brazen g
rabbiness of the War Party has shaped the contours of US foreign policy.
LIVING IN THE FREE WORLD
The President welcomed "the distinguished interim leader of a liberated Afghanistan, Chairman Hamid Karzai"  the fashion-plate President of the freest country in the world, where even pederasty is legal. This cute touch
is no doubt what inspired Bill Kristol to note that our true enemy "goes beyond terror":
"It is a war against dangerous tyrannies seeking weapons of mass destruction... In fact, since 'no nation is exempt' from the 'true and unchanging' principles of liberty and justice, American foreign policy can be said to
 be at war with tyranny in general."
And he isn't talking about Rwanda. According to the Kristolian interpretation of the Bush Doctrine, "our task, in this 'decisive decade in the history of liberty,' is to promote the principles of liberty and justice aroun
d the world  including in the Islamic world."
Read: especially in the Islamic world. The conceit that we're going to create "democracy" at gunpoint in a region of the world where both history and current events militates against it is one not meant to be taken seriou
sly. As Ariel Sharon's generals move to create a "Greater Israel," and disenfranchise Israeli Arabs, the depth of the US commitment to "democracy" and liberalism is measured by our silence  and our subsidies.
A BALD-FACED LIE
The hypocritical cant that characterizes this administration was really brought home in some of the small touches, such as the appeal to women.
"The last time we met in this chamber, the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going to school. Today women are free, and are part of Afghanistan's new governme
nt. And we welcome the new minister of women's affairs, Dr. Sima Samar."
Good luck to Dr. Samar in talking the Afghanis out of customs firmly rooted in culture and generously nurtured by religion. Meanwhile, to say that "today women are free" in Afghanistan is to utter a bald- faced lie. The m
others and daughters of that ravaged land are still captives in their own homes, imprisoned by accident of birth and hidden behind their veils. And there isn't a thing Dr. Simar or President Bush can  or should  do abou
t it.
LEST WE FORGET
The War Party keeps saying that we must never forget 9/11 and yet their rationale for a wider conflict is by now so attenuated from that event that they are the ones who seem to have forgotten. As the pundits weighed in o
n the question of whether Bush hit a triple or a home run, and the editor of National Review contemplated relaunching the Crusades, Howard Fineman, reporting in Newsweek, noted that certain aspects of the investigation in
to 9/11 seem to be stalled:
"Dick Cheney was on the line, and it wasn't to chitchat. The vice president rarely calls the Senate leader  a Democrat he dismisses as an 'obstructionist'  so Tom Daschle knew the topic was important when he hurried int
o his Capitol office. What he heard was a plea, and a warning. The Senate will soon launch hearings on why we weren't prepared for, and warned about, September 11. The intelligence committee will study the matter, but mos
tly behind closed doors. Cheney was calling to preemptively protest public hearings by other committees. If the Democrats insisted, Bush administration officials might say they're too busy running the war on terrorism to
show up. Press the issue, Cheney implied, and you risk being accused of interfering with the mission."
THE 9/11 COVER-UP
The last thing this administration wants is an investigation into the circumstances surrounding 9/11  what we knew, what we didn't know, and who may have had advance knowledge. After conceding that "people need to know w
hat happened," Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle was reportedly "noncommittal"  meaning that the Democrats have as much interest as the Republicans in keeping this thing under wraps. After all, the 9/11 attacks were y
ears in the making, and if anyone is going to receive the lion's share of the blame, then surely it is the Clinton administration.
Which raises the question: then why aren't the Republicans pressing for a fully public investigation? It's mighty odd passing up a chance to score political points in an election year  unless, of course, this administrat
ion has something to hide.
CONGRESS MUST INVESTIGATE
What's needed is a full and completely open congressional investigation into how Al Qaeda managed to operate right under our noses for years without anyone knowing it. Billions were spent in the name of "fighting terroris
m"; task forces were convened, legislation was passed, special programs were set up  all, apparently, to no avail. What's up with that? Inquiring minds want to know.
Oh, but that would interfere with "the mission," says Cheney. This is true only if "the mission" is an attempted cover-up of some of the worst criminal incompetence in the history of intelligence- gathering. Good lord, wh
at is wrong with the American people? When are they going to snap out of their TV-induced stupor and start asking some questions? The smoke had barely cleared from the air over Pearl Harbor before the Republicans of 1941
started questioning the Official Story  even if it did take some 50 years to vindicate them. This time around, both parties have an interest in covering up the truth.
NEVER FORGET  EXCEPT SOMETIMES
Ah yes, we must never forget 9/11  except we have to forget about ever knowing why and how it happened. If a national movement calling on Congress to investigate the events surrounding 9/11 does not rise up and demand a
full accounting, then this country is brain-dead and not worth saving.

@_subject: Arrival of the American Garrison State 
Arrival of the American Garrison State
by Paul Fallavollita
February 1, 2002
The Pentagon is proposing the creation of a four-star command to oversee
federal troops engaged in "homeland defense" activity on American soil.
While CINC regional chiefs have long coordinated deployments overseas,
none exist for North America. Soon, however, the circle will be complete,
and the noose will be around our necks.
Supporters defend this proposal as a way to "streamline" the command
system. We should have learned by now that making government more
efficient and effective only makes it easier for that institution to
transgress against the rights of the people.
Traditionally, Americans have been wary of using the military for domestic
law enforcement. The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. 1385) enshrines
this principle into law. Article One, Section Eight, Clause Twelve of the
Constitution attempts to curb the ability of the executive to wield
domestic standing armies, by stipulating that appropriations for the
military cannot be extended at any one time beyond a two-year period. Few
Americans stop to think about the Third Amendment, ostensibly still in
force, which prohibits the government from quartering soldiers in the
peoples' homes. Taken together, these laws indicate that the aversion to
standing armies is a well-established and justified part of the American
way of life.
The military is not in our homes yet, but they are roaming about the
country, and they are in our neighborhoods. Delta Force and Night Stalker
types have terrorized a number of American communities over the years,
conducting SWAT-like "training" with live ammunition near residential
areas, including in Kingsville, Texas during the 1999 domestic program,
"Operation Last Dance." Extensive sales of military equipment, including
armored personnel carriers and concussion grenades, to local and state
police departments have also taken place.
On another front, a bill re-instituting the draft made its way into
Congress just before the New Year, HR 3598 IH, the "Universal Military
Training and Service Act of 2001." The militarization of American society
is apparently of greater importance to our leaders than recognizing that
the government was not granted the authority to conscript citizens into
service, especially in light of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition of
involuntary servitude. From a market perspective, even the military should
realize that a draft would be contrary to its own interests. A draft would
cause military pay rates to stagnate and even plummet, since Congress
would no longer feel pressure to enact pay raises when they can just press
more people into service. This logic is lost on our leaders, however, as
they lay the groundwork for the Garrison State.
Since 9/11, our leaders have turned the fear of the American people into a
blank check to create a global prison camp. Should the reader suspect this
an exaggeration, consider that we may never see a blatant headline one
morning in the newspaper stating, "President Declares Police State, End to
Constitution." Rather, the only headlines heralding the coming of the
American Garrison State will be buried deep in the hindmost pages, telling
us, "Pentagon Seeks Creation of Four Star Command for North America." This
is incrementalism, where our leaders silently slip each puzzle piece into
place, one at a time.
Incrementalism provides the government with plausible deniability about
its end game, making it easier for its defenders to characterize
libertarian warnings as "paranoia." Not that this necessarily implies a
conscious conspiracy at work---it is a well-known feature of any
government to expand infinitely, however well intentioned this growth
might be, unless checked by the vigilance of the people. Post 9/11, the
vigilance of the people seems more scarce than usual, as they rush to
cling to a State-provided security blanket.
If you say of the coming Garrison State, "it'll never happen," ask
yourself if you can be certain of that, since history shows that many
unlikely and strange things do happen. Ask yourself what President Hillary
Rodham Clinton might do with her newfound powers in 2008. Recall Lord
Acton's famed quote: power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts
absolutely. Are you willing to take such risks with the precious jewel
that is this Republic?

@_subject: American Caesar 
American Caesar By Patrick J. Buchanan
Friday, February 1, 2002
"Upon what meat has this our Caesar fed that he has grown so great?" The line from "Julius Caesar" came to mind as I watched the president,
triumphant in the Afghan war, thunderously threaten three nations with
war, should they seek to acquire weapons the United States has had in its
arsenal for more than half a century.
In the Kennedyesque rhetoric of the State of the Union address, the
president marched us closer to war than any since JFK threatened a "full
retaliatory response" on the Soviet Union in the missile crisis of '62. By
describing Iraq, Iran and North Korea as the "axis of evil," Bush
hearkened back to Ronald Reagan's "evil empire" rhetoric and equated these
countries with the Axis powers we crushed in World War II: imperial Japan,
fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.
Their fate will be your fate, the president warned.
Casting aside TR's admonition to "speak softly, but carry a big stick,"
Bush issued his ultimatum loudly and in the clear: "Time is not on our
side. I will not wait on events, while dangers gather. I will not stand
by, as peril draws closer and closer. The United States of America will
not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the
world's most destructive weapons."
Will not permit? This is a threat of war. Yet, Harry Truman did not
threaten war to prevent Stalin from building atomic weapons when Russia
tested a bomb in 1949. LBJ did not threaten war on China after Mao tested
a nuclear weapon in 1964. While it is U.S. policy to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons, Russia, Britain, France, China, Israel, India, Pakistan
and probably North Korea have already acquired them, with no retribution
from the United States.
Let me say it bluntly: Bush erred in putting his own and U.S. credibility
on the line that we will launch a preventive war rather than permit any of
them to acquire a weapon of mass destruction.
First, he put these regimes on notice that they may be attacked, and soon
("time is not on our side") - giving them the most powerful of incentives
to build a nuclear weapon, i.e., deterrence and survival. Second, he
issued a threat he lacks the authority to carry out. For Congress has not
empowered Bush to launch wars on nations that have not attacked us. Third,
what do we do if North Korea explodes a nuclear device? If we attack
Pyongyang's nuclear sites, we could face atomic retaliation on our 38,000
troops in South Korea or a murderous barrage from thousands of artillery
pieces on the DMZ.
Were the South Koreans consulted before Bush threatened war on their
heavily armed northern brethren, who have a million troops massed within
50 miles of their capital city?
Even if Bush has concluded that war on one or more of the three regimes is
essential to our security, why declare, urbi et orbi, that America will
launch it, and probably soon?
How can a nation back down, after being publicly threatened? Even Serbia
chose to resist rather than submit to an ultimatum from Madeleine
Albright. And Iran, Iraq and North Korea are far better armed than the
In straining to reach Churchillian heights in their rhetoric, the
president's speechwriters took him over the top. Why engage in this
Caesarism, this hubristic triumphalism? Has Bush been carried away by his
triumphs and his polls? What happened to the Bush's pre-election promise
of humility walking hand-in-hand with American power?
Thus far, America's war on terror has been fought in a way to impress all
but the inveterate America-bashers. The president set a goal - ousting a
Taliban regime that refused to turn over the terrorists who had
slaughtered our people - and achieved it. He has the entire nation behind
his battle to eradicate al-Qaida.
Why, then, when he does not have the troops in place to attack Iraq, or to
invade Iran or North Korea, threaten them? What is the benefit of a public
threat that could not have been achieved with a private warning from
Secretary Rumsfeld or Gen. Powell?
Why ratchet up the rhetoric, months before we can act? Why set down a
marker that can be thrown back in the president's face, if one of these
nations detonates a weapon of mass destruction, and he does not go to war?
In the wake of our Cold War victory and Gulf War triumph, the president's
father began to rhapsodize about creating a "New World Order." It proved a
mistake. And to threaten nations, even regimes like Baghdad, Pyongyang and
Tehran, with war, when U.S. spending on national defense is but half of
what it was when Bush Sr. launched Desert Storm is also a mistake. And a
major one.

UK Train Passengers Pass By Gay Man Having Sex With Goat
By Alastair Taylor
A chef had sex with a goat - and was seen by a trainload of passengers, a court heard yesterday. Stephen Hall, 23, lassoed the animal with his belt at the Paradise allotments near his home. As the packed Hull to Bridlington train stopped at signals, dozens of passengers stared out in amazement. In seconds, police switchboards were jammed as horrified commuters used their mobiles to report what they had seen. The female goat was one of a number left to graze near the allotments, Hull Crown Court was told. A man out walking his dog also made a 999 call to Humberside Police Control Room. Two members of the public pinned down Hall while a stream of officers raced to the scene. Jobless Hall, from Hull, was initially arrested by the Humberside Police Dog Section. A vet who examined the goat said it was "subdued" by the assault but was not suffering long-term injury. British Transport Police Detective Inspector Dave Crinnion, who investigated, said: "I saw the goat the next day " it did not seem too upset but it is difficult to tell." Yesterday, Hall admitted a sex charge involving an animal. Judge Jacqueline Davies, who adjourned the case for reports, said: "I do not know what sentence the court will impose on you." He is due to be sentenced on March 13. Hall, who says he is gay, said after the hearing: "My friends have been giving me a lot of stick. They are all joking with me about it.

Post-9/11 security fears usher in subdermal chips VeriChip recipients can be ID'd, monitored anywhere in the world By Sherrie Gossett
Monday, February 4, 2002
Heads up, future cyborgs! Implantable chips are back in the news, with the
current focus on a tiny chip that can be injected into your body, then
used to identify and monitor you.  Media reports are calling it "the stuff
of science fiction," and Reuters likened it to something from the 1999
blockbuster film, "The Matrix."
Referring to the chip, David Coursey of ZDNet contends that "even paranoia
has a point," and John Soat of Information Week predicts that now "the
call for a national ID system takes on a whole new meaning."
At the center of the worldwide media stir: the announcement by Applied
Digital Solutions of Palm Beach, Fla. (Nasdaq: ADSX) of its implantable
In a post-9/11 landscape, where various high-tech security systems are
vying for supremacy and a lasting relationship with the government, ADS
wants its piece of the pie.
These high-tech security systems have sparked a renewed debate over how
best to profit from emergent identification technologies while maintaining
a fair balance between civil liberties and the increased need for homeland
Critics of the chip express concerns over the specter of persons being
injected with the chips against their will, perhaps surreptitiously in
conjunction with a routine vaccination. In addition, they are concerned
about the possibility of such chips eventually being mandated by the
government as a form of ID.
But let's separate the science from the fiction. What is the VeriChip? How
does it work? What is its potential relationship to government? Is it
really a potential threat to civil liberties - or a life-saving miracle of
'Enhance present forms of ID'
The VeriChip is a syringe-injectable radio-frequency device about the size
of the tip of a ballpoint pen. It's designed to carry a unique ID number
and other critical personal data. Once injected, the chip can be activated
by an external scanner, and radio frequency signals then transmit the ID
number and other stored information to a telephone, the Internet or an
FDA-compliant data-storage site.
Its initial use is being touted as an ID for medical implants, such as
heart-regulating devices and artificial joints. The chip can hold info on
required settings, the device's original components, and other essential
parameters. It is also a ready source of data about the implantee's
identity and medical condition.
As WorldNetDaily reported in March 2000, Applied Digital Solutions is also
pushing use of the chip for emergency and security applications, to
"enhance present forms of ID," to enable search-and-rescue operations, and
assist in various law enforcement activities. The company contends that
its technology is superior to biometric technologies, pointing out that
implantation makes it a "tamper-proof" means of identification,
"substantially diminishing theft, loss, duplication or counterfeit."
Are critics' concerns over privacy and tracking capabilities of the chip
legitimate? Or are they just the technophobic squawkings of a collective
pen of "Chicken Littles"?
The Los Angeles Times contends that "these chips are not true tracking
devices" and that "the next generation of body chips, which transmit
signals from a distance is still several years away." Futurist Paul Saffo
says, "This is rightly going to prompt a debate . but the good news is we
still have years to figure it out."
Do we?
To truly understand the future potential of this technology, it is
necessary to look back to perhaps one of the most underreported events of
Back to the future
The event was the private unveiling of ADS's prototypical Digital Angel
technology - a technology centered around an implantable chip that, once
injected into a human being, allows it to be tracked in real time via GPS
(Global Positioning System), the information then relayed wirelessly to
the Internet, where the person's location, movements and vital signs can
be remotely monitored and stored in a database.
The company first announced that it had acquired the rights to this device
in December of 1999. Company documents described Digital Angel as "an
implantable transceiver . inserted just under the skin . that sends and
receives data and can be continuously tracked by GPS. When implanted in a
body the device is powered electromagnetically by muscle movement and can
be triggered by the 'wearer' or the monitoring facility." Implantation of
Digital Angel was said to be "future" and "subject to FDA approval," with
its preliminary use being outside the body, in the form of a wristwatch.
The strategy implied a "Phase I - Phase 2" approach: using the technology
outside the body first, followed by a Phase 2 for implantation, dictated
by the need to wait for FDA approval as well as the need to gain popular
Prior to the unveiling of the prototype, Applied Digital Solutions CEO
Richard Sullivan issued a statement intended to underline the "historic
first" of this "breakthrough in communications technology." He announced
that Secretary of Commerce Norman Mineta would attend the private event.
"We're extremely pleased that Secretary Mineta will attend our Digital
Angel demonstration," said Sullivan. "Secretary Mineta has been a champion
of 'digital inclusion' - making access to digital technologies more widely
accessible to all segments of society." The CEO added: "He has been an
advocate of creating viable partnerships between the public and private
sectors as part of a national digital inclusion campaign. We believe our
Digital Angel technology has enormous potential along these lines."
"In fact," added Sullivan, "Digital Angel represents an exciting 'new
frontier' in the digital revolution."
The announcement followed Mineta's appearance as keynote speaker at the
Inland Empire Technology Summit for ADS subsidiary Timely Technology
Corporation. The focus of that event was said to be "sharing insight
concerning current and future impact of technology on government, on
education and on our daily lives."
The unveiling of Digital Angel was held the evening of Oct. 30, 2000, at
Cipriani's of 42nd St. in New York City. The invitation-only event was
closed to the public, and was made up mainly of members of the government,
the military, private investors and Wall Street analysts. Media presence
was scant.
Some of those in attendance were surprised to find that not only was
Mineta in attendance, but he was featured as the keynote speaker of the
Advising Clinton on 'digital inclusion'
On a futuristic set, bathed in a purplish light, CEO Richard Sullivan took
the podium welcoming attendees to "the future." He stressed that the
evening was special because "we have a number of very important government
officials with us this evening . including . Norman Mineta." Sullivan
emphasized Mineta's role in "helping to develop technology and e-commerce"
and added: "As if all that weren't enough . Secretary Mineta personally
advises the president of the United States [then President Clinton] on all
matters concerning commerce, economics and Digital Inclusion. ."
Mineta was further portrayed as a "champion of forging effective
partnerships between the public and private sectors." Sullivan made clear
that "this idea of forging 'partnerships' is one of the main reasons the
secretary is here this evening . and why we're so excited about having him
here with us."
After introducing Mineta, the two shook hands as Sullivan announced: "I
just want to say how delighted we are at Applied Digital Solutions to
launch an exciting new partnership with you and the federal government in
the important area of digital inclusion."
Mineta, flanked by four bodyguards, gave a keynote address underscoring
the value of working together to build coalitions, and of partnering with
"firms like yours" so that the "elderly and less fortunate" might benefit
from the "great technological revolution." He underscored the historic
chance to spread the benefits of the information technology to everyone in
society, and emphasized the importance of digital technology to America's
economy, emphasizing the importance of information technology in the
economic success of the U.S.
Mineta added: "I applaud you, Dick Sullivan, for your success and the
direction you are taking with Applied Digital Solutions. . As a nation, we
cannot afford to miss out on this technology."
$100 billion marketplace
Much was made throughout the evening of the importance of digital
technology to the U.S. economy. Economically, what was at stake was a
projected $100 billion marketplace for Digital Angel. Critics have claimed
this figure is impossible unless universal implantation mandated by
government was being considered. Conservative estimates for use in the
U.S. were said to be $70 billion, characterized as 26 potential vertical
markets. A company spokesman, who asked not to be named, revealed that the
$70 billion projection was provided by McKinsey & Co. management
consultants. Randy Geissler, CEO of Digital Angel.net Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary, said that strong alliances were key to Digital Angel's
success, and that the company's close partnerships with Raytheon-Hughes,
the U.S. Department of Energy and pharmaceutical giants like
"Schering-Plough" meant that the company was well-positioned for success.
Geissler was the former head of the animal-tagging company Destron
Fearing. ADS acquired the company in order to leverage its management
experience and relevant technologies, like its trademarked "BioBond," a
polymer sheath used to coat the glass-encased chip, causing fibrocytes and
collagen fibers to grow around the chip, preventing migration of the chip
through body tissue. Under the guise of Destron Fearing, Digital Angel has
won FCC licensing approval of the frequencies needed for widespread
tracking of humans.
The most anticipated part of the event was the actual demonstration of the
technology, described as a "show" by Chief Scientist Dr. Peter Zhou. A
former research scientist at the Max Planck Institute in Stuttgart,
Germany, and a holder of advanced degrees in solid state physics and
materials science from the Beijing University of Science and Technology
and the University of Pennsylvania, Zhou also has numerous patents in the
field of electronic detection systems.
Zhou announced that an ADS engineer equipped with the chip would be
tracked through the streets of Manhattan. Attendees watched as the
engineer's location and movements were tracked in real-time via GPS,
relayed wirelessly to the Internet, and displayed on a large screen before
the audience. The computer screen represented the engineer's location as a
red arrow on a large color street map of New York City. The red arrow
moved forward, backward, to the left or right, as the engineer, miles
away, moved through the city. A separate Internet screen displayed the
employee's pulse and body temperature for the past two weeks.
Not all of the medical monitoring capabilities of the technology were
displayed, such as monitoring heart patients, or using blood-oxygen
analysis to determine if the subject being monitored is awake or asleep.
The person monitoring the subject can even tell exactly where on the
continuum between waking and sleeping he is.
How it works
The building blocks of Digital Angel technology are a convergence of
micro-electronics, information technology and life sciences. The
centerpiece is an implantable microchip. It includes an antenna that
receives signals from GPS satellites and collects biological information
from embedded bio-sensors. request of the ground station, it will
send these two groups of information to the monitoring center, through
different levels of ground stations and Internet systems. It has a
built-in GPS receiver and a wireless transceiver.
To communicate potential uses of Digital Angel, a video of edited news
reports was shown, depicting human tragedies that might have been avoided
had the technology been used. These included the death of a
tractor-trailer driver who fell asleep at the wheel, as well as the search
for missing children.
The potential applications for Digital Angel advocated by ADS were
stunning in their scope and novelty. Also notable were the number of items
that would make the government a customer.
Applications included medical monitoring: enabling a doctor to remotely
access a "wearer's" vital signs and analyze them, as well as detect
potential problems before he was even aware of symptoms. Of course, "the
doctor would know where to locate the patient." Security applications
included locating kidnap victims, lost children, autistic persons and the
elderly. Warfare applications promised to enable commanders to "always
know where their soldiers are located and whether they are alive or
wounded." In this capacity, Digital Angel was said to be "an invaluable
aid, both tactically and strategically."
In the realm of personal identification, the company stressed that
"requiring this ID for logon would prevent unauthorized access to
computers." The suggestion was also made that in this context, Digital
Angel could conceivably become a universal standard for computer access
security, superior to all other systems, because other systems reside in
the machine, not the person. However, this estimate discounted viable
biometric logon set-ups, such as Compaq's fingerprint scanner.
Law enforcement uses recommended for Digital Angel included its use "to
track parolees, people under house arrest, and individuals in witness
protection programs." Use of the chip was even advocated as a method of
gun control, preventing "unauthorized use of firearms." It was predicted
that overall, "Digital Angel will become an interface between the human
and electronic networks."
Early press coverage of Digital Angel was scarce, but news reports and
commentaries by WorldNetDaily and a few others generated sufficient
grass-roots protests to ADS over implantation plans that the company
backed away temporarily from talking about subcutaneous microchips, and
using terms like "cashless society."
Implantation? What implantation?
Indeed, two weeks prior to the Oct. 30, 2000, prototype demonstration,
references to human implantation were removed from the company's website,
including references in archived press releases, and the fact that the
implantable "future" version of Digital Angel would be "subject to FDA
Also removed from the site was a description of the company as the
"pioneer and developer of syringe-injectable, miniaturized microchip
technology for implantation under the skin," the method of implantation
said to be "similar to a routine vaccination" - the microchip said to
contain the "individual's unique ID number," which would be "stored
permanently, just under the skin, where it cannot be lost or altered."
The microchip was said to remain for "the life of the individual with the
unique ID number intact." The wording was exactly the same as that used
under the Destron Fearing animal-tracking page, with the substitution of
"individual" for "animal."
Although these references to human implantation were removed from the
website, there are archived versions in various forms preserved on
individual home pages and other areas of the Internet.
During his speech, Sullivan sought to allay concerns over implantation, by
denying that the company ever had such plans: "Let me be very clear on one
important point," he said. "This potential marketplace is for an
attachable device . something worn on the outside . close to the skin.
We're not even planning on or even considering any other applications at
this time. Only external uses! All our energy, all our focus . all our
effort is in this direction, period. Any other approach or suggestion is
purely hypothetical speculation at this time."
Following Sullivan's speech, this reporter asked Dr. Zhou if he had been
quoted correctly by WorldNetDaily in a previous interview, when he
reportedly said: "Before there may have been resistance, but not anymore.
People are getting used to implants. New century, new trend." And, "We
will be a hybrid of electronic intelligence and our own soul." He
indicated that he had, in fact, been quoted correctly.
In comments following the demonstration, Chief Technology Officer Dr.
Keith Bolton, drink in hand, expressed exasperation over implantation
protests coming from a "noisy 20 percent," whom he identified as
Christians who believe the Digital Angel chip is the "mark of the beast."
He was sure "the other 80 percent wouldn't mind." "Besides," he added,
"FDA approval could take years, and we can start making money off of this
thing now!"
As recently as June, 2001, the company continued to deny implantation
plans, when it offered a response statement to be posted on Declan
McCullagh's Politech website. The statement asserted, "We are not now
developing, nor do we have any plans to develop anything other than an
external, wearable device."
At the conclusion of the event, private investors like Nathan Rosenblatt
indicated that they were waiting to see more details of the partnership
with the government unveiled before investing. Dr. Yongguang Chen and Dr.
Duanyi Wang called Digital Angel a "great invention" and added for "final
success" they hoped that the U.S. government would "further loosen"
military restrictions on the use of GPS satellites.
The scientists were part of a research team that worked on developing the
technology. The prototype was originally scheduled to debut in December of
last year, but in July ADS signed an agreement with Princeton University
and the New Jersey Institute of Technology, for additional scientists to
work on the project, under Zhou's leadership. They worked on issues like
"antenna size" and "body tissue absorption." As a result, the agreement
"helped implement an accelerated schedule for delivery of a working
prototype of Digital Angel," resulting in it debuting nine days before the
presidential election.
Following the October event, Mineta had been scheduled to appear with
Sullivan at a Boca Raton school, along with business leaders in a PR
event, to be held the day before the election. Free computers would be
offered for schools, but the centerpiece of the appearance was to be the
showing of an edited five-minute video of the New York City event.
When questioned about the nature of the partnership with the government,
company spokesman Matthew Cossolotto suggested it would include the
subsidizing of Digital Angel for "minorities, the disadvantaged and the
elderly." He added that a formal public announcement of the full extent of
the partnership would not be made until one to two weeks after the
The event was cancelled at the last minute, perhaps due to the difficulty
in securing mass media coverage as a form of free advertising, the day
before a presidential election.
Sept. 11 opens door to implantation
As the saying goes, the Chinese character for "crisis" is similar to the
one for "opportunity," and in the wake of Sept. 11 the company is strongly
pushing its product - and openly discussing implantation - adding that now
people are more open to it.
Recent company statements have underscored that the VeriChip is superior
to biometric technologies, since it is designed to be implanted and is
thus "tamper-proof." The company is looking to bring these products to
"market as quickly as possible."
A week after the tragedy, Digital Angel offered its GPS tracking devices
(currently in wristwatch form) to New York City's fire department, as well
as to the U.S. Department of Transportation, saying that they could "aid
in continued search-and-rescue efforts."
CEO Sullivan remarked, "With the recent tragedy, it is our duty to
expedite the development process and offer Digital Angel in its current
beta form to the rescue efforts of all agencies connected with national
and personal safety and security," adding that "Digital Angel has many
applications that can be used during this national tragedy."
Then in a revelation that gives "profiling" a whole new twist, Palm Beach
Post writer Deborah Circelli reported that CEO Sullivan complained that
the 9-11 tragedy proved "today's security measures don't work very well,"
and he has a better idea. Namely, implant all foreigners passing through
customs or immigrations with the chips. The implanted chip would replace
green cards, "allowing officials to monitor their activities better and
keep terrorists out." In the wake of Sept. 11, he said, "the government is
more prepared, for the overall benefit of our citizens, to advocate some
of these changes."
Circelli continued: "In five years, Sullivan said he can see the chips
being used in children, the elderly, prisoners, and by employers at
facilities such as airports and nuclear plants. Society in general could
use them instead of ATM or credit cards."
Meanwhile, Mineta is still the company's point man in Washington, a fact
underscored by Sullivan's comment that, "We chose the NYC Fire Department
and the U.S. Department of Transportation due to existing relationships.
In fact, Norman Mineta . was the keynote speaker at the Digital Angel
World Launch in October of 2000."
Financial hopes
Applied Digital Solutions has high hopes for this intense product push. In
1999 it boasted a five-year revenue growth of 64,012 percent and was
ranked the fifth-fastest-growing technology company by Deloitte and
Touche's "Fast 500." Earlier in 2000, the company won the prestigious
"Technology Pioneer's" award from the World Economic Forum in Davos,
Switzerland. The award is given for contributions "to worldwide economic
development and social progress through technological advancements." The
World Economic Forum gives such awards as part of its commitment to foster
entrepreneurship in the "global public interest."
But the company lost $11.4 million in the first quarter of 2001, and $33.9
million for all of 2000, leading it to gain a 2001 "Turkey of the Year
Award" from the South Florida Business Journal, for "gushing red ink
faster than you can say 'pass the gravy please.'" Called a "troubled
company" that had "suffered sizable losses over the past few years," SFBJ
noted that the company had been "cautioned over a possible delisting from
Nasdaq," that it was earlier in the month "out of compliance with its line
of credit," and that a "recent SEC filing said the company couldn't
predict whether or when it would be profitable." The Turkey column
concluded with the plea for someone to "stick a fork in this turkey. It's
Even though the company has a lot riding on this recent public relations
push, questions over involuntary uses of the chip remain amid
contradictory company communications and recent news reports.
A Silicon Strategies article reported that the company was "backing away
from involuntary ID applications, such as the tracking of prisoners or
parolees," while a Wired magazine article said that Digital Angel
technology was "designed with people who stray in mind, such as parolees."
Reuters had, in fact, already reported in December that the company had
won a 3-year trial contract with California to provide its technology to
track parolees in Los Angeles. The Silicon Strategies report quoted CTO
Bolton as saying, "we are advocating that this technology be totally
voluntary," while a Washington Post article said Bolton indicated use of
the chip should be voluntary unless the law allows otherwise.
Regarding the California project to track parolees, Amro Albanna of
Digital Angel said, "we hope this program will serve as a model for other
counties in the state."
Civil libertarians agree that technology is value-neutral, amoral. But
they add that the key issue at stake is who will control the technology,
and whether it could ever be used against the will of people. Referring to
the broad gamut of implantable chips, Dr. Ellen McGhee, director of the
 "A
paramount worry is who will control the technology . the prospects for
sinister invasions of liberty and privacy are alarming."
Lucas Mast, an Internet privacy and telecommunications analyst at the Cato
Institute in Washington, D.C., expresses the same worry: "My biggest
concern from this technology is the unknown variables. If the government
becomes a customer, will they have access to all databases maintained by
ADS? For example, if they implant the technology in felons, will they also
be able to track people and items which have the technology for other
purposes like e-commerce?" He adds that "the slippery slope argument may
come into play here - using it for felons, using it for lost persons, and
all of a sudden it moves from being a voluntary program to one mandated by
our government for the alleged good of society. Now that is scary."
The use of the technology in felons also raises the problem of removal,
since such chips are said to be "virtually impossible to remove," once
In her ethical assessment of implantable chips, McGhee and Dr. Gerald
Maguire of the Royal Institute of Technology in Kista, Sweden, wisely
called for public debate and a multi-disciplinary evaluation from thinkers
in fields of computer science, biophysics, medicine, law, religion,
philosophy, public policy and international economy. Such a debate and
evaluation is "urgently needed," they said.
And although such implantable chip technology undoubtedly has many
beneficial and even potentially life-saving uses, Mast warns that "if the
technology of Digital Angel falls into the wrong hands, be that of
terrorists or our own government, we may all be concerned and it may be
too late to turn back."
He adds: "It will be interesting to see public reaction to this technology
- comparisons to Orwell's 1984 and even the Nazis seem obvious."
The potential misuses of the implantable technology underscore the role
that independent public policy think tanks can play in serving the
interests of society. Along with the type of public debate and evaluation
called for by McGhee, Maguire and others, policy think tanks could
recommend legislative initiatives designed to ensure that the benefits of
the technology can be reaped without involuntary implantation of the
technology ever becoming a government mandate.
Five years ago, a Chicago Tribune writer held that implantable chips were
"long a popular delusion among paranoids" - but he nevertheless predicted
they were "likely to be marketed as a consumer item early in the next
That prediction is now true. The chips are real, they're here to stay, and
they're coming soon to a syringe near you.
Welcome to the future.

ENRON AND THE CORRUPT-O'CRAT'S: 
'THE POT CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK'
by Roger Fredinburg
    It seems that America's energy giant (Enron) managed to drop considerable amounts of cash in the laps of virtually anyone influential in and around the beltway. Over the past decade their affluence touched the lives and wallets of every power broker in the known world.
    From President Clinton to then Governor Bush. Up and down the halls of congress regardless of party,  out into the activist arena where even Jesse Jackson managed to escape with some loose Enron change.
    Some of us are bound to ask what Enron got in return for their investment.  While they are clearly in bed with everyone, where all parties seem willing to kiss and tell, the fact remains that Enron is belly up, bankrupt, gone the way of the dinosaur. Is there a lesson here for other corporate leaders who continue paying the required ransom for access in American politics today? To coin a phrase 'Where's The Beef?'
    Accounting giant Arthur Andersen is now on the hot seat as are the leaders at Enron. They are both wading in government contracts which might reveal answers to the questions about what they got in return for their investment later. But the real question is who among the many can rightfully be charged with the duty of investigating either Enron or Andersen while the unmistakable odor of Enron cash permeates the beltway, lingering about like anthrax in the Hart office building.
    Enron's demise is a tragedy and many innocent bystanders will suffer greatly for the mismanagement and misleading if not diabolical tactics employed to continue the fraud and rip off the shareholders, employees and the American taxpayer. Clearly the law was shredded, the checks and balances of regulation failed and the stench will likely spread beyond Enron as more companies are exposed for using similar tactics.
    It does get worse, much worse when you recognize that these shenanigans are nothing new to our federal government agencies. After all, where do you think all of these creative accounting methods were developed?
    In recent months we have seen numerous examples of poor accounting practices and criminal like behavior on the part of our own government.
    Documents and lap top computers go missing from the State Department. Security breaches at our most secret labs and agency branches. Thousands of personal computers, lap tops, guns and other weapons by the hundreds a year just go missing. Hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars are lost in the     Recent attempts to audit the Internal Revenue Service were foiled because the accounting practices there are so abysmal that the worlds leading accountants threw up their hands and walked out, 'Mission Impossible' was the going explanation, although they were able to determine that tens of billions of hard earned taxpayer dollars had simply disappeared, year after year without any explanation. Nobody was held to account by the all seeing ever present watchdog we call congress. No hearings, no arrests, no discovery, nothing but silence.
    Similarly, when a contingent of Congressmen unexpectedly walked into the Department of Education and demanded a look at the books there was found to be tens if not hundreds of billions of taxpayer Dollars unaccounted for. Billions upon billions of dollars just gone. Does anyone remember how many Department Of Education people were investigated, how many were arrested, questioned by proper authorities?  the answer is zero. Not one person was held to account for all that missing money. And rather than be held to account the Clinton administration gave tens of millions of dollars in bonuses to agency managers throughout the system and none of those bonuses were tied to performance. To make matters worse, The new Bush administration is handing over to the thieves at Education an additional 26 Billion of our hard earned dollars to plug into their faulty accounting system.
    The contrast between how the Congress responds to the creative accounting at Enron and their lack of attention to the unique and some would say criminal accounting practices used by the agencies of government they oversee is stifling. On one hand they posture themselves as competent and trustworthy to properly inquire as to Enron's possible wrongdoing. Regardless of the fact that they were essentially on Enron's payroll. We're to trust that they have no conflict of interest because they tell us they're loyalty is to their constituents and the taxpayers. Yet, they stand idly by while the bureaucrats rip us off by the hundreds of billions and do absolutely nothing to stop them.
    Not to excuse Enron and Andersen for their follies, but it does seem a bit like the 'pot calling the kettle black' to me.
    One set of executives threatened with prison and the loss of everything they've worked all their lives for,  that very threat being levied by another group of public executives who's accounting and management practices make the Boys and Girls at Enron look like saintly stewards of other people money.
    Obviously the culprits at Enron and Andersen should face the music and pay the price for breaking the law. Moreover there should be some form of restitution if at all plausible for their victims. I'm confident that the courts will ultimately remedy this as much as possible.
    But what do we do about that other set of criminals out there who aren't facing charges but should be? Will they be allowed to continue on raping, robbing, maiming and mugging the taxpayers without being held the same standard as the crooks at Enron?    I wonder.......

Would you care to elaborate on that? I don't see how game theory would prove your assertion. The only party who would benefit of this "not posting" would be the
government. For them it is best that you don't connect to other than
government approved Truth sources.
My logic tells me it is best to ensure the widest coverage to issues you
care about, get as many sources as you can, and simply ram down the facts
as many people's troats as you can, and eliminate the PR your opposition
is trying to feed to your audience. (Maybe this is what you are trying?
:-) O.J. trials, FBI vs China-spy, Microsoft vs DOJ, US presidential
elections & related trials, Enron, Russia's president Putin & "Terrorism",
etc. all prove this.  He who does the better PR job, or control of all
popular media sources, simply wins, whether he was right or wrong.
That's how reality works. That's why and how the Israeli control the US
media and the reporting is so biased there every time it comes to the
Palestinians and Israel. Popularity polls for the US president and
congress are all that matter in directly deciding the whole of US foreign
policy. Nothing else matters.
That much is painfully clear to the rest of the world.
Breaking the rosy one-sided picture of Israeli behaviour
in the American media is one way of effecting those polls.
Maybe the relative concept of "cypherpunk list quality" suffers due to
crossposts but it has never been high (IMHO) on this list during it's
various incarnations, and it has always sooner or later come down to the
same "spammer" level of anarchistic reality, while the signal/noise ratio
draws infinitely closer to zero.
There are nice procmail scripts on the web useful for eliminating
messages containing sufficiently enough duplicated message content,
should you use other than this CypherPunks approved Reality Source.
But maybe you should consider NOT using any of the alternative news
sources instead? The news that I send you, the Truth which I tell you,
should be enough.

The Looting of America
Reagonomics, Clintonomics & Enronomics
by Al Martin
Reaganomics has never worked and it can not be defended. When you see TV pundits like Larry Kudlow and Bill Seidman defending Reaganomics, you must understand that they are not pure economists. They are political economists, and they owe their careers to the Republican Party. Both Kudlow and Seidman make their money as senior economists for the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, other Republican so-called think tanks, economic research institutes and socio-economic forums. Bill Seidman, of course, was the former chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), where there were many allegations of fraud. When the RTC was charged with cleaning up the S&L mess, it promptly proceeded to sell off a lot of property at very favorable prices to well-known Republicans and Republican interests.
No matter what Republican political economists says, Reaganomics in the final analysis can not be justified because you can not defend the indefensible. You cannot get around the fact that the Reagan Bush Regime came into office with a $1 trillion accumulated National Debt and the Social Security Fund (both the General Fund and Disability Fund) was fully funded. They came into office with all the other 43 Public Trust Funds, such as the Indian Affairs Fund and the National Reclamation Fund, fully intact and funded. Most importantly, they came into office with the United States being the largest creditor nation on earth. Twelve years later, when the Reagan Bush Regime left office, they had expanded the National Debt from $1 trillion to $5.65 trillion. They had created a total long-term deficit in the Social Security General and Disability Trust Funds of some $3.2 trillion. Then in 1983, they started to say that we are henceforth going to count social security contributions as surpluses to the Fund, and we will count them now as General Revenue. To offset the drain, we will place non-marketable, long-term, US Treasury Bonds with a 3% coupon rate into the Social Security Trust Funds. In other words, we will stuff the Social Security Fund with worthless paper.
The Reagan Bush Regime tried to say that these were US Treasury Securities ­ but they were restricted and non-marketable. That which is restricted and non-marketable, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, is a worthless instrument -- whether that instrument is government, corporate or By the end of Reaganomics (when George Bush left office in January 1993), the public treasury was spilling red ink at the rate of $2 billion per day, approximately twice what the Bush Administration said the deficit was. The fact remains that the deficits, during the Reagan Bush Regime, were consistently twice as high as what was publicly revealed. Due to the "voodoo economics" of the Reagan Bush Regime, they were able to hide the deficits in a variety of ways, principally by this egregious and nonsensical Reaganomics technique called "off budget deficit financing."
When they were deciding budgetary matters in Congress, they would say, "We'll put this $8 billion 'off budget' or this $12 billion 'off budget.'" What this meant was that "off budget financing" was simply money, being spent currently, which was not being recorded as having been spent currently. It was simply an accounting trick. It was also like maintaining two sets of books, wherein you can spend money, say $8 billion, but instead of putting it in the deficit column, it shows up as a zero figure and the $8 billion deficit is transferred to your second set of books called "off budget The problem with "off budget financing" (and the reason why the Treasury Department to this day can not balance its books) is that this is money, which still has to be raised through the regular sales of US Treasury bills bonds and notes. What happened was that the sale of these bills, bonds and notes for off budget financing was put in a separate category, not as actual liability or actual debt of the US Government, but future contingent debt.
Future contingent debt is debt that is not immediately due, payable, or honorable by the US Government. It was only due and payable, when said notes were presented for redemption -- whenever their term or maturities ran out. In other words, "contingent" means upon redemption at a future date.
There is a parallel between this tactic of Reaganomics and the latest accounting tricks of so-called Enronomics, and the failure of the energy giant Enron. Enronomics used the same trick to hide losses -- even though one is a government entity and the other is a corporate entity and the bookkeeping is different. But Enron did use the same tactic in hiding its losses through offshore accounts. This is much more complex, in fact, extraordinarily complex. There are numerous ways they did it. One way was to enter into a transaction, which is known as a "cross," an "options" or "futures collateral cross."
A "cross" means you cross out a current cash contract for a future contract and all obligations, debts, and liabilities, profits included, are then rolled over into the next series of contracts. Remember all futures contracts and options contracts are issued fixed strike price, fixed series. But a cash contract (and this is where Enron got in trouble towards the end) is unrestricted. This means there are no price limits imposed on daily movements. Future or so-called non-cash contracts are susceptible to daily limits, either up or down, hence the expression "limit bid" or the expression "limit offered."
This is where you can get into a squeeze (and this is not the first time) as in the late 1970s, when Revco and Continental experienced the same squeeze in the grain markets. In the mid 1970s, Holly Sugar and Clewiston Sugar experienced the same squeeze in the sugar market. How you get into trouble is when a market takes off in one direction and keeps moving in that one direction. In Enron¹s case, they came into September 11, being short oil because there was a widespread expectation in the oil market that the price of oil was going to drop by as much as two dollars a barrel in the fourth quarter. That was the widespread expectation. Demand was falling and OPEC was not cutting production to offset the falling demand and that was the expectation. After the September 11 Incident, when the price of oil began to skyrocket every day, limit bid, limit bid, limit bid, day after day, eleven days in a row, when you were short in the forward contracts, there was no limit. The liability was endless, and in the forward contracts, the price of oil began to spread between the cash current contract and the next available futures contract increased from about 60 cents a barrel to over $4 a barrel -- very quickly. So if you¹re short in the cash contracts and all of the futures contracts are "limit bid," it is almost impossible to hedge your risk because, in order to offset the current short in a cash contract, you have to get long in the futures contract. If those futures contracts are opening up limit bid every day and stay "limit bid" all day long -- and not only "limit bid," but "limit bid with pools."
"With pools" means that there are so many hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of contracts to buy, which cannot be fulfilled because there are no sellers. Thus, what happened is that Enron found itself having to cross out contracts in the cash market, which effectively meant that they had to buy back a current short into a sharply rising market. It was Enron, and not only Enron, but Southern California Edison (SCE) which was also caught very short. All of the oil companies (Mobil, Exxon, etc.) were all caught on the wrong side of the market.
In essence, what you had was a lot of buyers chasing a rapidly increasing market. Because of these buyers, the spike in the price of oil that happened after September 11, reached unnaturally high levels because you had so many buyers in the cash contracts.
They had very few offsetting long positions. Why? Because A) they were under the impression that the price of oil was going to fall. B) They were also under the impression that the demand for oil would continue to fall because there was plenty of physical deliverable oil in the United States at the time. What happened is that the physical supplies of oil got used up pretty quickly because all the secondary marketers wanted to buy that oil, that physically currently deliverable oil before the price went even higher. They were locked into contracts with utility companies and even some county and state governments to sell that oil and/or natural gas at a fixed price at a certain time in the future. And that is how the California Energy Debacle happened. Companies that had made obligations to sell oil and/or natural gas at a fixed price at a fixed time in the future found themselves having to buy that energy that they had to deliver in a rising market.
So, despite my personal differences with Bill Clinton (I was no fan of Bill Clinton), I¹d like to offer a few words in defense of Clintonomics. As I mentioned in my book ( the Clinton Cadres had lied to me when they first came into power. I was offered a deal, wherein they would help me out to collect the debt that Oliver North owed me, as long as I kept my mouth shut about my knowledge of Bill Clinton and other senior Clinton Cadre members¹ involvement in CIA-sponsored narcotics trafficking in Mena, Arkansas, and other, shall we say, exotic financial transactions appearing within financial institutions and investment companies in the state of Arkansas, not least of which was the Stephens investment group and the Worthen banking group. But those are my personal differences.
I believe you have to give credit where credit was due, and Clintonomics, the idea of restraining government spending, the idea of not reducing taxes, but offering tax incentives for true increases in productivity and efficiency, worked. Clintonomics (what Clinton announced as his long-term economic policy) was that he would restrain federal government spending ­ and that he did. And even Democrats couldn¹t believe it. Republicans couldn¹t believe it either. Who ever heard of a Democrat restraining federal spending? Such a thing had never occurred before. Clinton knew that the United States economy was very shaky when he took office because of the enormous debts accumulated by the Reagan Bush Regime, which they had hidden. They did a tremendous job of building confidence, of lying, of hiding figures. Clinton knew that that could not be sustained, and that we had to generate fiscal surpluses as quickly as possible. Remember Clinton came into an economy with a 7% unemployment rate and a 7% inflation rate. Clinton knew that those numbers had to be brought down, and one way that could be done was to restrain federal spending and offer a tax incentive package to business and industry that actually incentivizes them to increase productivity and efficiency. You would have thought he would have pumped up spending on social programs as Democrats have traditionally done in the past, but instead he actually restrained spending across the board and put in strict caps for all categories of federal spending. He said that that spending could not increase more than 2% a year in all categories. Washington pundits were amazed. Nobody believed this guy in the beginning, that he would stick to this plan and that he would be able to carry it out.
Clinton was able to stick to it, despite opposition from both Republicans and Democrats. The Republicans pounded him to increase defense spending. But he stuck to it and it bore enough fruit, so he could go to the American people directly and say that we are diminishing the federal budgetary deficit of our predecessors; inflation is coming down; unemployment is coming down; and it works. What was novel was that he was able to go over the heads of both parties directly to the American people ­and that was his strategy. The American people saw that it was working and that engendered support for his policies. The Republican and Democrat parties hated him because of it.
The Republicans did everything they could to beat him up on defense spending. They said our defense capabilities are falling apart; the equipment is falling apart; we need more money; Clinton is allowing us to become defenseless. Clinton¹s response to that was absolutely correct. He said that no matter how much money you spend on defense, the Republicans always said the same thing. They never change their tune. There¹s never enough money spent on defense to make them happy.
The essence of Clintonomics, then, is genuine fiscal prudence, sustained over a period of years, something we have not had since the first term of Eisenhower. There was, of course, pork barrel spending, but Clinton used the line-item veto extensively, even with his own party. Why do you think Senator Byrd didn¹t like him? He kept vetoing Senator Byrd¹s $10 billion West Virginia Highways to Nowhere.
Clinton curbed pork barrel spending. He reined in federal spending in general. It was Clinton who reversed the social security policy and began to put social security money that people were paying, the FICA taxes, back into social security, instead of counting them as general revenue -- what the Republicans did into the second term. They¹d say that Nixon was able to produce a surplus too. But it¹s so disingenuous when the Republicans say that because there was a tiny surplus of $3 billion in 1969, but the only reason that fiscal surplus was created was because of Johnson¹s reduction in defense spending in his final year in office. Nixon didn¹t have enough time to increase defense spending, since he came in January 2, while the federal budget closes September 30. Right after that, we went back into deficits.
Clintonomics had this nation back on the right track, economically speaking. Fiscal surpluses were growing. Clinton had a scheme to begin to repurchase and retire government debt through open market transactions, something the Bush II administration just discontinued because there is no more surplus engendered to be able to do that. We had four successive years of federal surpluses created. Debt was being repurchased and retired. The Republicans said that these surpluses could not possibly be real because the National Debt continued to increase. The reason why it increased was that the bills, bonds, and notes that were originally sold, the Treasury instruments, to finance this off budget debt were coming due for redemption in greater numbers than the surplus that was being created. It¹s just that the surpluses were being consumed and then some by maturing debt which had not been calculated as debt to begin with.
Now there¹s more Republican disingenuousness. Remember how Bush II campaigned originally ­ on the platform that he would continue Clintonomics. That¹s what he said. He didn¹t have to say that, but that was the truth. In all the campaign speeches he made, he did not try to defend Reaganomics, or the economics of his father. He didn¹t try because he knew it was a can of worms. When George Bush II got into office, he immediately reverted to a Bush. He can¹t help himself. He¹s a Bush, so immediately he ratcheted up federal spending especially on defense ­ into a slowing economy. The slowing economy was not Clinton¹s fault, and it wasn¹t Bush¹s fault. It was just a natural reaction of a speculative bubble that had been created in the internet industry. When that bubble burst, the effects rippled throughout the economy, and the economy slowed down. Therefore Bush was put in a difficult political position. He knew the economy was slowing, yet being a Republican and being a Bush, he couldn¹t help himself, but to spend more money on defense. Then he proceeded to institute the largest tax cut in the history of the country. People think that since they got their $300 check in the mail, that¹s it. People must remember that this is not a one-time tax cut, but it¹s a ten-year program, a $1.6 trillion tax reduction. It is the largest tax reduction package ever put through. It should also be remembered that 93% of the tax benefits of this package go to those earning $200,000 a year or more. Because of this tax cut and the dramatic increase in defense spending into an economy which is already slowing, Bush has taken what was a projected 10 year accumulated surplus of $2.2 trillion and turned that into a negative number. As of fiscal year September 30, 2001, when all previous surpluses had been exhausted, Bush is going to take a zero surplus economy (a break-even economy) and, by September 30, 2002, we¹re looking at a $250 billion deficit. By September of 2003, we¹re looking at a $400 billion deficit. When Clinton left office, he left with a Clinonomics ten-year plan and a twenty-five year plan, which was called Target 2025. In the ten-year projection of Clintonomics, which would have happened if Bush kept his pledge, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had projected that at the end of ten years we would have accumulated an aggregate fiscal surplus of $2.2 trillion. Now under the Bush II Regime, this has turned into a negative number. In ten years, there will be accumulated fiscal surpluses, but in fact, there will be a further accumulated fiscal deficit carry-forward.
If you take Clinton¹s plan and extrapolate it over 25 years, we had to raise approximately $15 trillion of fresh federal surpluses. That would have been enough to pay down the National Debt and to refund Social Security all that was owed with interest in arrears, to pay down all remaining off-budget debt, and to pay down any other government "non-streamed" or "non-collateralized" government obligations. It would also have been enough to fill all the holes in the 44 public trust finds, created by the Reagan-Bush looting of said public trust funds. For example, the Indian Affairs Trust Fund now has a deficit of $10 billion that was simply stolen to mask Reagan Bush deficits. Every one of the 44 public trust funds now have multi-billion dollar deficits, yet the revenue streams continue. Now because of Bush¹s own economic policies, he cannot fulfill any of his pledges.
Already we see a remarkable increase in the federal budget going to debt service. Clinton had reduced that figure substantially. The peak of that number occurred in 1986, during the Reagan Bush Regime when 26% of the federal budget went to servicing debt. Clinton had reduced that number to 18% in his final year in office ­ and had the Clintonomics plan stayed in effect, that number would have gone to zero by 2025.
The percentage of debt service has already risen to 20%, and if one extrapolates Bush spending plans and tax cuts over the next ten and twenty -five years, we are talking about an accumulated national debt, by 2025, which will exceed $30 trillion.
People are trying to blame the recent downturn in the stock market on various short-term fundamentals, like accounting scares, for example. The real reason the dollar has been falling and the price of gold has been gradually rising, is that there is a growing loss of long term confidence in the US economy by both American and foreign investors. Our equity and debt markets are going to continue to suffer, as long as Bush is in office and his policies remain in effect. Former Rep. Bill Alexander (D- Ark.) told me that Clinton used to say privately that he realized that the rest of the world outside the United States was gradually falling apart. The projections were done through the Target 2055 study, the largest inter-agency study commissioned during the Bush I Administration, which included participation by OMB, GAO, Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Reserve etc. It was the greatest financial and economics-demographics study ever done by government at a cost of $3 billion. It was this study whose conclusions were so dire that the Bush Administration had it suppressed until they left office.
Clinton knew that by the year 2025 other First World countries would begin to collapse, and the United States, in order to keep the whole world afloat, had to be in a position to bail these other nations out ­ but to do so at the least cost to the American taxpayers, a plan that did not commit taxpayers to a open-ended long-term liability.
The Clinton plan was to let most of the other nations collapse, and they figured the collapse would take up to about 2040 to occur. Then the foreign debt of these former First World nations would be trading at ten cents on the dollar. The United States could have used its enormous fiscal surpluses, which would have been created by 2040, actual surplus money, something the US government has never had. We could have used those accumulated surpluses to purchase the debt of foreign countries, to bail them out, to effectively impose real fiscal discipline on them, and to change their economic systems from the political, social and economic doctrines of social welfarism to lasting and unfettered capitalism and unrestrained free enterprise. This was the long-term thinking of the Clinton Administration.
Now with Bush policies, we come back to the short-term again ­ let the Bush administration do whatever is in its best political interest in the short term and let the next administration worry about the consequences. But now the consequences are much more dire because we will not have the money available to stabilize the rest of the world, when it will be incumbent upon us to do so because we should have been, in twenty years time, the only remaining country in terms of a viable economy.
We were supposed to be, in fact, we were destined to be the Global Savior. Yet Bush has taken that away. We will now be in the same position, relative to other nations, in twenty years time, in terms of our accumulated national debt and in terms of the percentage of the federal budget that is being used every year to service that debt -- the same position as nations which are And what did Clinton tell Alexander? Clinton realized that we would eventually become, in thirty or forty years¹ time, a one-world government. As Clinton understood, it wouldn¹t be a one-world government by design. It would be a one-world government by default. It wouldn¹t be any complex or sneaky or shadowy plan to put the UN in as a puppet for the US. As the rest of the world fell apart, the United States would emerge as the leader, the only viable economy left standing and the only country with the financial capability to stabilize the rest of the world. We would have a defacto one-world government by default -- because the rest of the nations wouldn¹t be able to do anything about it.
Now in thirty or forty years, you¹re going to have a one-world government by design ­ not by default. The conspiracy theorists have much more to worry about under a Bush Regime long term, than they did under the Clinton Regime long term. Those who believe in some sort of sinister machination behind the one-world government have much more to worry about under a Bush Administration. It¹s not going to be a one-world government by default anymore ­ since we¹re going to be among the defaulters.
We have lost a golden opportunity when Clinton left office. We were looking at a $250 billion a year fiscal surpluses that could have been both sustained and increased indefinitely simply through the continuation of Clinton¹s economic course. Inflation and unemployment were coming down. The dollar was at all time high, and even our balance of trade deficits were starting to reverse. The economy was in the best shape ever. The Dow Jones average was trading above 11,000. Real interest rates were at all-time lows, and economic productivity and efficiency were at all time highs. Now Bush has taken our nation from the road of fiscal responsibility and put us on the Bushonian path of never-ending federal budgetary deficits and never- ending increases in the gross National Debt.
Everyone should understand the dire consequences in the longer term. We are now going to join the rest of the world in a gradual decline. Our internal security policies are going to be such that we are going to be a dictatorship, but that dictatorship is going to be necessary to control a United States in a gradual state of economic collapse. Why do you think these security measures are being put in place? Why do you think Bush is doing this? We are gradually turning this country into a dictatorship. Very few people would actually disagree with that idea. All the new restrictions on personal liberties and freedoms will increase over time.
More power will be consolidated in the office of the presidency. The militarization of law enforcement will become a fait accompli -- after the Posse Comitatus Act is rescinded and military forces within the United States are increased. This will be necessary to control civil unrest and political strife, which will undoubtedly be created in the throes of the inevitable Bushonian-inspired economic collapse.
Bush II has now committed America to the path of Grand Malfeasance, or as his father used to say ­ "to the continuous consolidation of money and power into higher, tighter, and righter hands." The Bushes¹ success in this strategy is illustrated by the fact that the top 1% of the population controls 53% of the nation¹s wealth. It should also be noted that 88% of that top 1% are Now the Clinton Administration¹s fiscal responsibility is being perceived in a new light. It¹s actually referred to as the "Salad Days" of recent economic Meanwhile, to counteract the coming depression, the Bush Family, the First Family of Prozac, will encourage Eli Lilly to make their products more available. George Bush Sr. has said that as long as we have Jack (Jack Daniels Whiskey) and Prozac, everything will be all right -- and the suicide rate will be held in check.
It might not even be necessary to legalize cocaine. All it takes is to direct the pharmaceutical companies to increase the production of Prozac, Zoloft (and don¹t forget Xanax) and all the anxiety and depression will simply vanish. At least, that¹s the plan.

"Immediately after business slave George W. Bush took power, Corporate

MISSING THE OVERALL
By David Podvin
Missing The Overall
A multi-trillion dollar financial scandal is occurring in the United States
right now. It threatens to inflict unprecedented carnage upon Corporate
America and horrific damage to our national economy. The mainstream media is
aware of it, but most Americans are not, because the corporate news outlets
refuse to report on it.
It is not conspiracy.
It is complicity.
The coverage of the Enron situation has primarily focused on the
disintegration of a powerful corporation due to the deceit and criminality
of those who ran the company. The few reporters who have looked below the
surface have proven linkage between Enron's corruption and its political
connections to the Bush administration.
While the crimes of former Enron chairman Kenneth Lay and the collusion of
former Texas governor George W. Bush are significant, the corporate media is
selfishly choosing not to focus on the big story.
In February of 2001, Enron stock was trading above $80 per share, which
placed a market value of more than $60 billion on the company. Today, the
stock no longer trades, rendering Enron virtually worthless. It is crucial
to remember that, despite the harrowing decline in its fortunes, the company
never reported a bad earnings quarter.
Enron's duplicity is an extreme symptom of a financial cancer that threatens
the health of the economy. The disease is a malignant accounting method that
has received legal protection from conservative politicians on behalf of
their corporate benefactors. It is called 'pro forma'.  Originally intended
to allow companies to compensate for extraordinary events that distorted
their financial reports, the pro forma accounting method has led to the
greatest fraud ever perpetrated.
Previously, publicly owned companies had been legally required to provide
shareholders with an honest accounting of their earnings. The standard used
was GAAP, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Under this method, a
company would state its earnings based on the old fashioned equation of
income minus expenses. Using pro forma, companies decide which expenses are
irrelevant, thereby providing great latitude for creativity.
(GRAPH) S&P 500 GAAP EARNINGS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REPORTED EARNINGS Sources:
Standard & Poor's,  Thomson Financial/First Call
As shown above, immediately after business slave George W. Bush took power,
Corporate America went on a lying spree. Freed from concerns about
regulatory oversight, this country's biggest companies became dramatically
more creative with their earnings reports. Current estimates for S&P 500
corporations are that they have collectively earned about $410 billion in
2001 when using the pro forma accounting method. However, when using GAAP,
they have collectively earned about $240 billion.
Those who claim that Enron was an exceptional case are technically correct.
While Enron overestimated its earnings by 100%, the average large publicly
held American corporation is overestimating its earnings by only 42%.
IBM reports pro forma earnings. So does Intel. And Cisco Systems. And Dell.
And Sun Micro. And Motorola. And Microsoft. And...
By engaging in such manipulation, with the assent of accountants and
governmental oversight agencies, Corporate America has conned the public
into investing trillions of dollars based on phony earnings. Cisco, for
example, has used its artificially inflated stock price as capital to
acquire other companies. Many corporate empires have been built on such
accounting legerdemain, including General Electric (NBC), Viacom (CBS),
Disney (ABC), AOL/Time Warner (CNN, Time Magazine), News Corporation (Fox),
The Washington Post Company (Washington Post, Newsweek), the Tribune
Corporation (Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times), and the New York Times
Company (New York Times, Boston Globe).
Enron is the tip of an iceberg on which sits the entire mainstream media.
A national association of accounting firms has called on the Securities and
Exchange Commission to require all publicly held corporations to report real
GAAP earnings. The return to ethical accounting standards would mean that,
in order to reflect the current valuation of the Dow Industrials, the
average would fall to 5825. In order to reach the historical norm based on
GAAP, the Dow would decline to 3300.
A major decline in stock prices would erase trillions of dollars of
investors' wealth. With the uninformed public currently heavily invested in
the market, this would have a crushing impact on the finances of the average
In 1995, Senate Republicans and almost half of their Democratic colleagues
joined to override President Clinton's veto of legislation providing
corporations with protection from shareholder lawsuits. The leader of the
effort to dramatically reduce civil liability for companies that report
phony earnings was Wall Street lobbyist Harvey Pitt, who has made a career
of defending the shady dealings of stock market thieves like Ivan Boesky.
Just as his father hid the magnitude of the savings and loan scandal until
after the 1988 election, Bush is desperately trying to obscure the truth
about Corporate America's financial sleight of hand in order to defer the
tumbling of the house of cards until after the 2004 campaign. He expects to
be helped in this effort by the man he appointed to be Chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the one who is most responsible for
seeing that corporations accurately report their earnings.  Harvey Pitt.
The powers that be are pulling out all the stops.
What they are fighting is the law of gravity. As the high powered executives
at Enron learned, all the political machinations in the world can't prevent
a stock from falling when the word gets out that the books have been cooked.
After investors discover theyíve been scammed, they sell, and the mightiest
of companies can be crushed. Less than a year ago, Enron was the seventh
largest corporation in America. Today, it is no longer functioning as a
business entity. It is, for all intents and purposes, dead.
The greatest legacy of the Enron debacle will be increased public pressure
on companies to report their real earnings. If corporations are forced to be
honest, then there will be shocking revisions in the financial statements of
America's most prominent businesses.
The current situation is a scandal of almost incomprehensible magnitude, but
it is not a conspiracy. For years, the disgrace of earnings manipulation has
been an open, dirty little secret.
Dissidents like the highly respected money managers at Comstock Partners
( and brokerage analyst Alan Newman
( have been screaming bloody murder
about how Corporate America is cheating the public.
Their voices have not been amplified. Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and Peter
Jennings appear loath to report that such high profile companies as Viacom,
General Electric, and Disney are also engaging in the accounting scheme.
The current reported level of corporate earnings is a mirage. The investing
public has been taken for a magic carpet ride. The deceit of management, now
so evident in the case of Enron, is endemic in corporate boardrooms across
America. It is the massive impending economic fallout from that bitter
reality which is the looming tragedy in this story.
While the media continues to focus on the microcosm of corruption at Enron,
the public at large has yet to be informed of the epidemic of the earnings
lies. As Deep Throat told Bob Woodward during the Watergate scandal, when
the reporter was focusing on the criminal behavior of Nixon functionary
Donald Segretti, "You're missing the big picture. You're missing the
"This thing involves everybody."

AMERICAN DISSIDENT VOICES
 Broadcast of February 9, 2002
 The Martyrdom of Wafa Idris
 By Dr. William Pierce
 Hello!
 I am sure that nearly all patriotic Americans are so embarrassed now
 about the Bush government's activity in the Middle East that you don't
 really want to hear more about it. I understand and sympathize with that
 feeling, but I think that the Middle East situation nevertheless merits
 more serious commentary.
 It is quite clear now that what I announced from the beginning about the
 Bush government's war aim in the Middle East was right on target. The
 aim was not primarily to catch or kill Osama bin Laden; it was to
 replace the Islamic fundamentalist government of Afghanistan with a
 puppet government that would accept handouts from the United States and
 do whatever it was told to do: thus ending Afghanistan's independence,
 bringing it under Washington's control, and eliminating Afghanistan as
 an obstacle to Israeli policy in the Middle East. This war aim, though
 never openly admitted by the Bush government, was justified to the
 American people with much baloney about the mistreatment of Afghan women
 by Muslim fundamentalists and the importance of "restoring democracy" to
 Afghanistan. So what we did with all of our cruise missiles,
 laser-guided bombs, and so-called "daisy cutters" was overthrow the real
 government of Afghanistan and replace it with a coalition of gangsters
 willing to accept bribes from Washington and headed by a yes-man who
 will say to the TV cameras whatever he is told to say.
 Does this make America more secure or serve genuine American interests
 in any other way? Well, it does insure a much larger supply of heroin on
 America's streets and school playgrounds. Afghanistan used to be the
 world's largest source of opium, heroin, and related drugs. The Taliban
 government put an end to that, for religious reasons, by outlawing the
 growing of opium poppies. The first act of the gangster government
 installed by George Bush and headed by Hamid Karzai has been to scrap
 the ban on opium production. It is a big source of money for the
 gangsters -- and "gangsters" is indeed the proper term for the motley
 assortment of warlords who have been armed and financed by the United
 States and who now have replaced the Taliban government, at least in
 Kabul.
 While American aircraft continue to bomb areas of stubborn patriotic
 resistance in Afghanistan, the Bush government is making plans for
 attacking the next country on Israel's hit list, as soon as the
 munitions factories can replenish its depleted supply of cruise
 missiles. George Bush, in fact, is carrying out step by step the program
 demanded by Jewish leaders in Israel and the United States immediately
 after September 11. I remember especially well former Israeli prime
 minister Binyamin Netanyahu stating that the United States must not stop
 with finding and punishing those responsible for the September 11
 attack, but it must eliminate every government that might conceivably
 permit hostile elements to operate from its territory, and he had in
 mind specifically Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran. We must eliminate every
 possibility for future terrorism, he demanded, and we must do it now.
 Jewish organizations and their neo-conservative camp followers in this
 country made similar demands, the controlled media indicated agreement,
 and everyone in the Bush administration saluted and shouted, "Yes, sir!"
 in unison.
 There's a famous photograph that has been given a wide circulation
 recently in many publications. It was taken on December 11 in the East
 Room of the White House during a memorial ceremony for the victims of
 the September 11 attack. It shows George Bush posing with his right hand
 over his heart as if pledging allegiance to the flag, but the only flag
 visible is an Israeli flag, filling the entire right side of the
 photograph. When I first saw this rather startling photograph I thought
 that the White House photographer must have inadvertently framed this
 picture the way he did. But certainly, it was no mistake. It was a
 carefully posed photograph, and it was approved by the White House for
 release to the news media. Its message is clear: "I, George Bush, pledge
 allegiance to Israel. I am an obedient servant of the Jews. I and my
 government stand ready to carry out your orders." If you haven't yet
 seen this photograph, you can easily find it on the Internet. I suspect
 that your interpretation will be the same as mine.
 And really, this explains many things in addition to the current war we
 are waging in the Middle East to replace all of the governments in that
 part of the world with ones more to the liking of the Jews, regardless
 of the cost to America. It explains why when George Bush or anyone in
 his administration rages on television about how the United States will
 wage war against terrorism to the very end, that any government that
 sponsors terrorism or harbors terrorists will suffer the same fate as
 Afghanistan, Israel is never mentioned. The politicians and media people
 completely ignore the fact that Israel engages in more state-sponsored
 terrorism -- more state-sponsored car bombings, political
 assassinations, and other acts of terror -- than any other country in
 the Middle East. They also ignore the fact that Israel's prime minister,
 Ariel Sharon, is a terrorist and a war criminal, and despite his record,
 whenever he comes to Washington he is treated as an honored guest.
 Sharon is on the verge of having an international arrest warrant issued
 for him by a court in Belgium on account of his arranging the mass
 murder of thousands of Palestinian civilians in the Sabra and Chatila
 refugee camps in Lebanon in 1982. Two weeks ago a Lebanese Christian
 militia leader, Elie Hobeika, alleged to have been one of Sharon's
 accomplices in the 1982 massacre, met with Belgian investigators and
 agreed to testify against Sharon in a war-crimes trial. Just two days
 after that, on January 24, Hobeika was assassinated by a
 radio-controlled car bomb outside his home in Beirut which also killed
 three of his bodyguards. The assassination bore all of the earmarks of a
 Mossad "hit." A fine fellow, Sharon. Fine people, those Israelis. And
 there's not been a peep out of the Bush administration about this
 particular act of terror. And the mass media here are pretending that it
 didn't even happen.
 Bush's East Room photograph beside the Israeli flag also explains why
 the U.S. government maintains the pretense that it is attempting to
 arbitrate a peace settlement between Palestinians and Jews, while at the
 same time supporting the Jewish war of genocide against the Palestinians
 and severely condemning any effort by the Palestinians to defend
 themselves. Israeli Prime Minister Sharon sends out his assassination
 teams on a daily basis, while George Bush continues to shake his hand,
 hug him, and give him enormous amounts of U.S. financial and military
 aid, but whenever the Palestinians make any move at all to defend
 themselves, the Bush government echoes Sharon's demand that Palestinian
 leader Yasser Arafat arrest the Palestinians responsible. Arafat is in
 the doghouse now, shunned by every politician in Washington, because he
 has not been arresting enough of his own people to satisfy Sharon. When
 the Palestinians recently attempted to purchase a shipment of arms from
 Iran to defend themselves, the Bush government acted as if Arafat had
 been caught redhanded in a criminal act. Every Palestinian who strikes
 at the Jewish occupiers of his homeland, at the Jewish oppressors of his
 people, is denounced as a "terrorist" not only by the Israelis but also
 by George Bush and every other politician in Washington.
 Two weeks ago, on January 27, another of these Palestinian "terrorists"
 carried out a suicide bombing in Jerusalem, killing one Israeli and
 wounding 100 others. The bomber was Wafa Idris, a 27-year-old
 Palestinian woman who lived in Ramallah and worked as a volunteer nurse,
 riding in ambulances and providing emergency care in field hospitals for
 Palestinians wounded by Israeli soldiers. Wafa was no wild-eyed Muslim
 fundamentalist or fanatical Palestinian nationalist. She was not
 involved in politics and was not even considered to be a Muslim by her
 friends and family. She didn't even wear the traditional head covering
 for Palestinian women. She was described by everyone who knew her as a
 friendly, open, caring, and fun-loving young woman. She used her spare
 time to give free lessons in language and mathematics to children in the
 Ramallah refugee camp. She simply had had enough of seeing her people
 humiliated and brutalized and murdered by Jews. She had had enough
 Palestinian children die in her arms after they were shot by Israeli
 soldiers. She had taken care of enough Palestinian children who had lost
 an eye or a leg at the hands of the Israelis.
 She herself had been shot at repeatedly by Israeli soldiers while she
 was on ambulance duty and was wearing her Red Crescent uniform, and on
 three occasions she had been wounded by rubber bullets. Israelis
 consider shooting at Palestinian medical personnel to be a sport. On
 January 27 Wafa had had enough and decided to hit back. The spokesmen
 for America's controlled media consider her a "terrorist." So do George
 Bush and Donald Rumsfeld and John Ashcroft and Dick Cheney, and all of
 them vow to continue their war against terrorism and against terrorists
 such as Wafa Idris. And the mindless, TV-watching yahoos with little
 American flags on their cars cheer the Bush team on. To them also, Wafa
 was a terrorist.
 Well, maybe so. But let me tell you, when America fights against
 idealistic young women like Wafa Idris and for murderous thugs like
 Ariel Sharon, it should be clear to everyone but the most clueless,
 flag-waving yahoos that we are fighting on the wrong side. And let me
 tell you something else: people everywhere in the world are beginning to
 understand this: not just Palestinians; not just Muslims; not just
 people who don't like Jews, but ordinary people everywhere who have any
 sort of clue about what's actually happening in the world, people
 everywhere who pay attention to the news and care about more than the
 latest ball-game scores.
 More and more of them, like Wafa Idris, have simply had enough of Jewish
 lies and Jewish arrogance and Jewish bullying. They're fed up. They've
 had enough of the Jews' using their "Holocaust" tales from the Second
 World War to excuse their behavior and silence criticism. They've had
 enough of Jews worming their way into everything, trying to take over
 everything, trying to tell everyone else what to do and what to say and
 what to think. They're sick of Jewish television, of Jewish corruption,
 of Jewish self-righteousness, of Jewish meddling.
 In the past most people were inclined to give the Jews the benefit of
 the doubt. They were afraid of being thought anti-Semitic. But now, from
 India to England, from Argentina to Australia, from Brazil to
 Bangladesh, people have had enough of the Jews. Their patience with the
 Jews has run out. They want the Jewish monkey off their backs and off
 other people's backs too. A real shift in attitude toward Jews is taking
 place around the world. The funny thing is that the Jews, who usually
 have very sensitive antennae for what people are thinking about them,
 for the most part don't seem to realize now that a profound change is
 taking place. Maybe they're just too drunk with their own power, too
 impressed with the fact that they have a ring in George Bush's nose and
 the U.S. armed forces at their disposal. And the politicians and the
 others that the Jews have corrupted don't seem to realize what's
 happening either.
 But I can sense it, and many others around the world can sense it.
 Certainly the Palestinians can sense it. The martyrdom of Wafa Idris has
 had a powerful effect on them. Women simply have not done before what
 she did. They left the bombing and the shooting to the men, but now
 thousands of Palestinian women vow that they will follow in Wafa's
 footsteps. She has become a Palestinian superhero, a model for
 Palestinian women to emulate. Huge posters of her have appeared all over
 Palestine. There will be more martyrs like Wafa Idris, many more, and
 disgust with the Jews will continue to grow around the world.
 The problem for the Jews is not just that the number of Palestinians
 they have to worry about attacking them suddenly has doubled. It is not
 just that the Palestinians have gained new inspiration and new
 determination. The Jews' problem goes beyond the Middle East. In
 occupied Palestine the Jews will respond to the Palestinians with more
 repression, more brutality, more arrests and torture and assassinations.
 Ariel Sharon may have his Mossad murder squads knock off other witnesses
 who might testify against him in a war crimes trial. But around the
 world the hostility against the Jews will continue growing.
 The mere fact that the government of Belgium is moving to put the prime
 minister of Israel on trial for genocide, that Belgium is moving against
 the very symbol of Jewish power and influence in the world, is a
 remarkable phenomenon in itself. That couldn't have happened a few years
 ago. It couldn't happen in the United States today, of course. But it is
 happening in Belgium, and similar developments will occur elsewhere.
 The Jews will try to counter this by cranking out more "Holocaust" films
 from Hollywood, by forcing all school children to read The Diary of Anne
 Frank and go on field trips to the nearest Holocaust Memorial. And that
 will work to keep the yahoos and most of the other lemmings in line. And
 certainly the politicians will continue to take orders from the Jews as
 long as the Jews continue to own or control most of the mass media of
 news and entertainment. George Bush will continue his blather about the
 "axis of evil" and will denounce as "evil" any country or government or
 group or individual that refuses to take orders and will threaten to
 annihilate anyone he designates as "evil" with all of the high-tech
 military might at his disposal.
 But in the long run none of that will be enough. No matter how many
 witnesses to his crimes Ariel Sharon orders murdered, awareness of those
 crimes will continue to spread; more people today are willing to talk
 about Sharon's genocide than were willing to do so five years ago. No
 matter how many cruise missiles George Bush fires at Iraqis or Iranians
 or others who won't knuckle under, hatred against the United States and
 Israel will only grow, and patriots everywhere who value the freedom and
 independence of their people will come to see America as the greatest
 threat to that freedom and independence. No matter how often the
 controlled news media denounce martyrs like Wafa Idris as "terrorists,"
 more and more people everywhere will understand who the real terrorists
 are. No matter how often George Bush denounces uncooperative patriots in
 other countries as "evil," more and more people around the world will
 know that it is he and his associates and the Jews for whom they work
 that are really evil. No matter how many new laws are passed forbidding
 people from criticizing Jews or exposing their lies, under the guise of
 outlawing "hate," more and more young people everywhere will see the
 Jews for the deceivers and corrupters and destroyers that they are.
 Part of the reason that the Jews and their camp-followers will fail is
 Wafa Idris.
 And part of the reason is that it's harder for them to keep secrets now
 than it was 50 years ago. Fifty years ago I might have had all sorts of
 important information, but it would have been much more difficult for me
 to share that information with you. There was no Internet, and generally
 the media of mass communication were accessible only to the very
 wealthy. Now I am able to distribute information and ideas to you and to
 the public through a dozen different media: through leaflets and
 stickers and pamphlets and posters and hundreds of books and other
 printed materials, and through recorded telephone messages, and through
 music and video compact discs and tapes, and through AM and shortwave
 broadcasting, and through the Internet.
 Part of the reason they will fail is arrogance. The Jews have never been
 more arrogant and obnoxious than they are today. They believe that it is
 no longer necessary for them to be cautious. The politicians who take
 orders from them seem to believe the same thing. They believe that they
 can do anything they want and then lie their way out of it if they're
 caught. They believe that as long as they have the baseball fans and the
 Sally Soccermoms and the mass media on their side -- as long as they can
 count of the votes of the lemmings and the support of the Jews -- it
 doesn't matter what anyone else thinks about them. Remember Bill
 Clinton, who thought that he could lie and charm his way out of
 anything? Remember George Bush's September 11 lie that America was
 attacked only because "Osama bin Laden hates our freedom," and that the
 attack certainly had nothing to do with the U.S. support of Israel's
 aggression in the Middle East? The Jews and the politicians don't expect
 intelligent people to believe their lies. All they care is that the
 lemmings believe them. But believe me, in the long run it does matter
 what intelligent and responsible and honest and patriotic people
 believe.
 And part of the reason is that the danger to you and to me and to the
 whole world of letting the Jews and their gangster underlings continue
 to run wild, bombing nations into submission, replacing governments that
 refuse to take orders, passing laws to stifle any criticism of their
 behavior, destroying populations and cultures with their insane
 immigration policies, greedily grabbing for more and more control,
 poisoning the minds and souls of young people everywhere with their
 television propaganda, and lying about everything -- the danger of all
 this is more apparent now than it ever was, more imminent, more
 threatening. In the past we all tended to ignore it, to put off doing
 anything about it as long as we could, but there is a growing
 understanding that we can't continue to put it off and evade the
 consequences. We must act against the Jews and the gangsters. September
 11 helped to convince us of that.
 We are in for some unpleasant times. The fighting will be dirty on both
 sides. There will be no Geneva Convention rules. The gangsters will
 claim that their opponents, being "evil," are not entitled to humane
 treatment. There will be more torture and more shooting of unarmed
 prisoners. The sort of cold-blooded murders carried out by the U.S.
 military at Uruzgan, near Kandahar, two weeks ago will become much more
 common and will be justified by the Bush gang and their successors on
 the basis that the people who were shot were "evil." Indeed, we wouldn't
 even have heard about the January 24 Uruzgan massacre if Bush's troops
 hadn't made a mistake and accidentally slaughtered their own
 collaborators. And no matter how atrocious things become the yahoos will
 continue to wave their flags and do what they're told.
 Yes, things will be very nasty for a while, and much that is good will
 be lost. But ultimately the Jews and their collaborators will be
 destroyed, and there will come a time to begin rebuilding. We will build
 a saner, cleaner, more beautiful world. Let's begin preparing for that
 now. Let me hear from you.
 Thanks for being with me again today.

@_subject: BushMob - Israel's Obedient PUPPETS 
Bush Administration Acts Like Israel's Puppet
By Charley Reese
My biggest disappointment in President George W. Bush has been in how he
has allowed himself to be manipulated by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
He has followed the same failed policy that his predecessor did.
That policy can be summed up as "the Israelis are always right, and the
Palestinians are always wrong." That's a very convenient policy for
politicians who don't want the powerful Israeli lobby on their case. But
if the goal is peace, the policy is a failure. If the goal is to protect
America's interests, the policy is a failure. If the goal is to bring
stability to the Middle East, the policy is a failure. If the goal is to
eliminate terrorism, the policy is a failure.
Now, when people pursue a policy that has not achieved the goals it was
supposed to, there are three possible reasons. One, the people are
stupid. I think we can eliminate that. Nobody in the White House is
stupid. A second reason is that they are afraid to change the policy
because of domestic political pressure. A third reason could be that
their goals are not the ones they publicly espouse.
I never thought I would feel sympathy for Yasser Arafat, but he's been
put into an untenable position. Imagine a football game. Imagine that
you take the coach away and lock him up in a room. Imagine that you
shoot half his team. And then imagine how silly it sounds for you to
demand of the coach that he win the game.
Arafat is under house arrest. He can't walk outside without chipping his
teeth on the muzzles of Israeli tanks. For weeks, no matter who did
what, the Israelis have bombed and shelled the Palestinian Authority
police stations - along with their equipment and files. The Israelis
have killed and injured numerous PA policemen. Yet Sharon continues to
demand that Arafat stop terrorism, and no matter what Arafat says or
what he does, Sharon scoffs at it.
Now, to our international shame, the Bush administration has adopted the
same pathetic line. Like a flock of parrots, Bush and his people repeat
whatever Sharon says. It's not just people in the Arab countries who see
this sorry spectacle. People all over the world are wondering how it is
that a little country like Israel can jerk the chain of a powerful
nation like the United States.
A few facts: The Palestinians are right. The Israeli occupation of East
Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza is illegal. When the occupation ends,
peace follows. As long as the occupation continues, so will the resistance.
Sharon has no intention of ending the occupation or of negotiating in
good faith. Israel's treatment of the Palestinians is a brutal record of
human-rights violations, violations of the Geneva Accords and violations
of United Nations Security Council resolutions.
It ought to make every American angry that our politicians tell us U.N.
Security Council resolutions are worth the lives of Americans to enforce
against Iraq but are to be vetoed and spit upon when directed at Israel.
Our policy is an insult to anyone who supports the United Nations, and,
frankly, people in Europe are getting sick of it.
Israel has hired two public-relations firms, in addition to its American
lobby, because it is scared to death that Americans are going to wake up
and see the connection between the Israel First policy and the attacks
that occurred Sept. 11. It need not worry about the Bush administration
or most of the Israel First journalists, but I hope the American people
have not all lost their ability to think and to reason.
In the meantime, the Bush administration ought to replace the American
eagle with a parrot clutching an Israeli flag in one claw and a tin cup
in the other.

@_subject: America Looks The Other Way - On Palestinian Holocaust 
From silence to the bullet  Thursday, February 21 2002 @ 06:08 PM GMT
Members of the US media need to take a clear stand against the illegal
practices of the Israeli army now, before the train of history passes them
and the ignominy of having stood silent while crimes against humanity were
By Ahmed Bouzid for PalestineChronicle.com
The Day will come, hopefully soon, when everyone, and not just those
watching the Palestinian-Israeli conflict up close, will look back to this
time with utter astonishment and disbelief and ask: Why was the American
media totally silent over Israeli war crimes against Palestinian children?
Why didn't they rise up, through their editorials and their on-air
commentaries, with disgust and indignation over Israel's policy of killing
children and innocent civilians as a tactic to pressure Palestinians to
turn against their leadership?
When such a day comes, will editors be able to legitimately plead
ignorance?  Unlikely. The evidence has been overwhelming, and everywhere:
from day one of this Intifada, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch,
Peace Now, Gush Shalom, B'tselem, along with the United Nations Human
Rights Commission, and many, many other groups, have been denouncing the
Israeli army's policy of shooting at children to kill.
As far back as December 2000, only three months after the outbreak of the
Intifada, Amnesty International concluded that: âFor a force trained in
policing riots and equipped and prepared for stone throwers, neither
stones nor petrol bombs should be lethal. Therefore there should be no
need for the use of firearms, let alone lethal force, against stone
And yet, the killing and maiming has continued, unabated, to the tune of
80 Palestinian children younger than 15 and 197 below the age of 18, and
tens of thousands of wounded, while the media have stood by in utter
silence. Indeed, not one editorial in any of the main media outlets that I
can remember since the outbreak of the Intifada a year and a half ago has
been published that stated, unambiguously or otherwise, that although
Israel has a right to defend itself, it has no right to kill and maim
children and innocent civilians as a pressure tactic; as a policy. Keeping
to a long-standing tradition of ignoring what human rights organisations
have to say (unless they are targeting America's official âenemiesâ),
the US mainstream media have decided to simply look the other way.
But then reports of such atrocities began to appear in the mainstream
media itself, under the very noses of editorial writers. Last October, for
instance, in a gripping article by New York Times reporter Chris Hedges,
published in the October issue of Harper's magazine, we read about the
Israeli army's routine practice of inciting Palestinian children and then
shooting them to kill. Hedges also appeared on NPR's Fresh Air on Oct. 30,
2001, where he told millions of listeners the following: âI've seen
death squads kill families in Algeria or El Salvador. But I'd never seen
soldiers bait or taunt kids like this and then shoot them for sport. It
was â I just â even now, I find it almost inconceivable. And I went
back every day, and every day it was the same.â
Then came the eyewitness accounts of Israeli soldiers who are now refusing
to serve in the occupied territories, citing their objection to âillegal
ordersâ for unleashing death and violence against civilians. In their
statements, the soldiers state: âWe, combat officers and soldiers who
have served the state of Israel for long weeks every year... were issued
commands and directives that had nothing to do with the security of our
country, and that had the sole purpose of perpetuating our control over
the Palestinian people; we, whose eyes have seen the bloody toll this
occupation exacts from both sides; we shall not continue to fight beyond
the 1967 borders in order to dominate, expel, starve and humiliate an
entire people.â
And lately, a heated, passionate debate within Israel itself is raging
about Israel's crimes against civilians. In a Feb. 10 piece in Israel's
Haaretz newspaper, veteran journalist Gideon Levy wrote bitterly that
âthe Israeli army has totally shaken off any and all moral
responsibility for the killing of these childrenâ, noting that âin not
one of these cases did the Israeli army spokesman take the trouble to do
the minimum human necessary thing â to express sorrow at the death of
the children. The only conclusion is that the Israeli army is not sorry
about their killing. That is the message to those who did the killing and
to the families of those who were killed. No less grave, the Israeli army
did not even contemplate investigating the circumstances of the deathsâ.
Levy goes on to observe: âThe fact is that not everything is permitted.
When the Israeli army wanted to prevent immoral and illegal actions, it
was able to do so. There are two offences that Israeli army soldiers have
rarely committed during the years of the occupation â sexual harassment
and looting.â
As is well known, Israel cannot engage in any atrocities if the government
of the United States decides that it must stop. And the US government will
not tolerate such atrocities if a chorus of outrage were raised by the US
media.  If the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Philadelphia
Inquirer, the Wall Street Journal, the USA Today, the LA Times, and other
papers, along with commentators on NPR, CNN, MSNBC and other media
outlets, started publishing and airing unambiguous condemnations of
Israel's policy of killing children, you can bet that the US
administration will ensure that such killing stops at once before the
outcry against Israel spirals out of control â and anything spiralling
out of control is the thing the US (and any government) fears the most. (A
campaign of outcries against US moves to do as they please with the
Taleban and Al Qaeda âdetaineesâ, with total disregard to the Geneva
Conventions, certainly has pressured the administration to begin worrying
at least about seeming to respect international law.)
In other words, the moral responsibility of the US media is clear and
direct:  the chain from silence to bullet is present, real, indisputable
and straightforward, and no matter how they choose to justify this
silence, members of the US media cannot shirk that responsibility and
maintain any claim to moral integrity.
Members of the US media need to take a clear stand against the illegal
practices of the Israeli army now, before the train of history passes them
and the ignominy of having stood silent while crimes against humanity were
committed forever blots their already soiled record on this unending
tragedy;  a tragedy in whose prolonged agony they must sadly accept a
share of responsibility.

Court urged to stop medicating of man who made threats against Bush
Tuesday 26th February 2002
Attorneys for a man charged with threatening George W Bush want the Supreme
Court to stop doctors from medicating him.
Justices were asked to halt the forced medication of Richard Allen
Humphreys. The court has not intervened in similar cases.
Humphreys, of Portland, Oregon, was charged last spring when he was
overheard making comments about the president in South Dakota. A judge said
last May that he was incompetent to stand trial.
He is being held in solitary confinement in a federal medical centre in
Minnesota, according to William Delaney III, an assistant federal public
Mr Delaney told justices that Humphreys is being forced to take psychotropic
drugs once a week. A judge agreed to allow the medication.
The Secret Service said evidence against Humphreys included a copy of an
internet chat room conversation with the comment: "If you hear that a man
runs up and throws gasoline and a match to Bush you will know that God did
speak through the burning Bush."

@_subject: Bush Push for Stiffer Hack Fines 
By Declan McCullagh  2:00 a.m. Feb. 23, 2002 PST WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department wants Congress to increase jail
terms and boost surveillance in an anti-hacking bill that will be
debated next week.
On Tuesday, a House Judiciary subcommittee is scheduled to vote on the
Cyber Security Enhancement Act, which already increases punishments
for illegal computer intrusions. In cases where miscreants knowingly
attempt "to cause death or serious bodily injury" through electronic
means, the punishment would be life imprisonment.
That's not stiff enough for the Bush administration. John Malcolm, the
deputy assistant attorney general, has testified that life
imprisonment also should include "reckless" offenses like wreaking
havoc on a 911 system or a hospital network.
"Although the hacker has not intentionally or knowingly harmed ...  patients, his reckless conduct has clearly put them at risk of death
or serious injury.... (The law should cover) not only hackers who
damage a computer system knowing that death or serious injury will
result, but also hackers who damage a computer system with reckless
disregard for whether death or serious injury will result," Malcolm
Also look for behind-the-scenes lobbying by the FBI and the Justice
Department on behalf of a replacement bill to expand police wiretap
powers even beyond last fall's mammoth USA Patriot Act.
Current law permits police to use devices that record the numbers of
incoming and outgoing phone calls -- or the Internet equivalent -- for
two-day periods. Cops legally can do that without a court order in
situations that could involve organized crime or the possibility of
"death or serious bodily injury to any person."
A revised version of the Cyber Security Enhancement Act would extend
that list to include "an immediate threat to a national security
interest or an ongoing attack on a (networked) computer that
constitutes a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment greater than
one year."
Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), the chairman of the crime subcommittee,
plans to introduce the revised bill as a replacement for the original
one at the vote next Tuesday.

   WASHINGTON--Gigi Sohn hopes that geeks have become so enraged by
   recent anti-piracy schemes that they'll finally want to fight back.
   The 40-year old lawyer, head of the Public Knowledge nonprofit group
   here, plans to recruit a ragtag band of technophiles and train them to
   become a corps of effective political activists on the Internet front.
   To Sohn, this means seizing on widespread discontent created by the
   attempts of Hollywood and the music labels to curtail file-swapping
   networks while promoting sweeping new anti-copying laws and standards.
   E-mail campaigns are easily ignored, and transforming online ire into
   effective political action is hardly a trivial task.
   Geek armies have always been eager to vent in online forums and clog
   the e-mail inboxes of errant congressional types. As far back as 1995,

Hitchhiker's World (Issue                                    Observable Elections
                     --------------------
     Vipul Ved Prakash      November 2004
     This is an interesting time for electronic voting. India,
     the largest democracy in the world, went completely paper-
     free for its general elections earlier this year. For the
     first time, some 387 million people expressed their
     electoral right electronically. Despite initial concerns
     about security and correctness of the system, the election
     process was a smashing success. Over a million electronic
     voting machines (EVMs) were deployed, 8000 metric tonnes of
     paper saved[1] and the results made public within few hours
     of the final vote. Given the quarrelsome and heavily
     litigated nature of Indian democracy, a lot of us were
     expecting post-election drama, but only a few, if any,
     fingers were found pointing.
     Things didn't fare so well in the United States. The
     Dieobold electronic machines, slated for use in many states
     for the November 2004 Federal elections, turned out to have
     rather large security holes. Cryptography experts, Avi Rubin
     et al, did a formal analysis of the machines and found that
     they could be subverted to introduce votes that were never
     casted[2]. An independent government-backed analysis
     confirmed this[3] and concluded that the Diebold voting
     system "as implemented in policy, procedure, and technology,
     is at a high risk of compromise."
     It is clear, even to a cursory observer, that Diebold
     systems are sloppily designed, never mind the sloppiness is
     a function of incompetence or intent. The recent controversy
     from the "Black Box Voting" security advisory titled "the
     Diebold GEMS central tabulator contains a stunning security
     hole"[4] has added to the confusion. It claims that a code
     entered at a remote location can replace the real vote count
     with a fabricated one. This security hole, discovered last
     year, is still not fixed says the advisory. In response,
     Diebold claims that this is possible, but only in debug
     mode, which does little to make people confortable.
     What is disturbing to me as a technologist is the
     burgeoning public opinion that electronics is an unviable
     medium for conducting the serious business of elections.
     Over the last year I've seen numerous formal reports and
     articles in popular press[5] equating the failures of
     Diebold systems with the untenability of electronic voting.
     This is rather silly. Diebold systems are not only poorly
     engineered, they are also seriously flawed in design. Even
     if they were immaculately bug-free, they are so far from
     what electronic voting systems should be, that I have
     trouble categorizing them as "voting systems". "Electronic
     counters" is more accurate.
     Various augmentations have been proposed to Diebold systems;
     most revolve around parallel paper trails. Verified
     Voting[6] for example proposes that a vote be printed based
     on the voter's touch-screen selection, so the voter can
     touch, feel and verify their vote before casting it into a
     traditional ballet box. These votes would then be processed
     with an OCR type machine to compute a cumulative result and
     the physical votes would be saved so an independent party
     can verify the electronic result at a latter date. This is a
     reasonable tradeoff -- after all integrity of elections is
     way more important than saving trees and time.
     While this is the best recommendation for the upcoming
     elections, it subtly promotes the primacy of paper and
     distrust in electrons. We know that paper elections are no
     more secure. The history of vote tampering in paper based
     elections is quite illustrious (I'll simply refer the gentle
     reader to [7]) and the reason electronics was considered in
     the first place was to eliminate such tampering. Verified
     Voting recommends that count of the physical votes is to be
     considered superior than that of the electronic counterparts
     in case of a difference. What happens if the process of this
     count is tampered using traditional methods? We are back to
     square one.
     The central point that I want to get across in this paper is
     that the promise of electronic voting is not merely a
     quicker, slightly more secure and ecologically enlightened
     replacement for paper elections. Electronic voting, if
     implemented correctly, could be a major qualitative leap,
     not only changing the way in which we approach democratic
     elections, but also the the way in which we expect a
     democratic government to function.
     Cryptographic Integrity
     I want to draw attention to the work done by cryptographic
     community in the last 20 years to study, formalize and solve
     many of the problems of Internet Voting. This area of work
     is focused on building election systems that leave behind a
     trail of mathematical proofs of the integrity of the voting
     process. With mathematical solutions to the common issues of
     vote tampering, it becomes unnecessary to trust election
     officials and it becomes possible to build voting systems
     that are open and universally verifiable.
     A voting system for appointing a democratic government has
     certain "ideal properties". These are rather obvious, but I
     recount them for the purpose of this discussion. First, all
     votes must be counted exactly like they were casted.
     Altering a vote, or leaving one out from the final tally
     must be impossible. Ballot stuffing, ie. artificial
     injection of invalid votes must be impossible as well. The
     system should reject non-eligible voters, and ensure
     eligible users can cast only a single vote. And, finally,
     votes must be absolutely anonymous -- even the voter should
     be unable to prove the way in which they voted. Systems like
     Diebold's depend on large-scale observation to uphold the
     ideal properties. Large-scale observation is hard, and once
     an act of tampering is done, there is little that can be
     done to detect or correct it. The attacks such as the one
     described by the Black Box Voting advisory are particularly
     heinous, since they compromise the entire election process.
     The ideal properties are true in paper elections when they
     are implemented perfectly, but the nature of paper precludes
     proofs of correctness without compromising anonymity. The
     problems are much the same as in the "Electronic Counter"
     systems; without correctness proofs, it is largely
     infeasible to detect and correct tampering.
     Cryptographers have been trying to emulate the property of
     anonymity that is inherent to paper when it us used as cash
     or votes. The research in the field has led to invention of
     several mathematical primitives and computing systems that
     not only model paper but go beyond to provide proofs of the
     properties they emulate. Techniques like blind signatures,
     homomorphic encryption, digital mixes and onion routing have
     been used to build systems that provide strong anonymity.
     The pioneering cryptographer David Chaum introduced the
     blind signature in order to build permit truly anonymous
     interaction on the Internet[8]. Since then, they have been
     applied to all manner of problems from untraceable
     electronic cash to electronic voting schemes. Blind
     signatures are a class of digital signatures that allow a
     document to be signed without revealing its contents. The
     effect is similar to placing a document and a sheet of
     carbon paper inside an envelope. When the envelope is
     signed, the signature transfers to the document and remains
     on it even when the envelope is removed.
     In his paper, Chaum hinted that blind signatures could be
     used for secret ballot elections. Fujioka, Okamoto, and
     Ohta[9] created the first significant blind signature based
     voting protocol, which made it practical to use blind
     signatures in democratic elections. However, some problems
     were discovered in their work, most notably the system's
     vulnerablity to a corrupt election authority. I present a
     system, dubbed ``Athens'', that builds on their work, but
     solves several problems in their model. I also focus on a
     real-world election system, rather than an Internet one, and
     adopt a pragmatic approach, in that I make use of physical
     resources like volunteers and physical infrastructure
     usually available for large-scale democratic elections.
     Athens also borrows elements and thinking from the
     Sensus[10] system and David Chaum's recent work on Visual
     Cryptography[11].
     Design of Athens
     The basic procedure for conducting a democratic election is
     fairly standard. The procedure has four tasks: Registration,
     Validation, Collection and Tallying. In Athens, these four
     tasks are carried out with a few specialized machines and
     software, most of which are connected through the Internet.
     While Athens employs an Election Authority to oversee the
     process of elections, it does away with the dependence on
     trustworthiness of one. Athens philosophy is that there are
     no truly non-partisan parties; even the Election Authority
     can't be completely trusted. The Athens model is closer to a
     "game" between contesting parties, such that the only way to
     cheat in the game is for all competitors to collude - an
     axiomatic impossibility. The Election Authority performs
     tactical tasks to optimize the election process, but all
     tasks performed by the Authority are open to review by
     competing parties.
     Registration
     Registration is the process of determining eligible voters,
     and is conducted by the "Registrar" -- a distributed
     authority put in place by the Election Authority. The Athens
     registration process involves validating voters (through
     traditional means) and registering their "Voter Public Key"
     in the "Register." The corresponding "Voter Secret Key"
     remains with the voter, magnetically encoded (or bar coded
     for cheaper implementation) on a "Voting Card".
     The keys are generated through the "Voting Card Creator
     Machine". The Card Creator Machine is also implemented as
     software that can be used by a voter on their home computer.
     It is not hard to imagine Card Creators installed in local
     registration offices or even at Kinko's and shopping malls,
     where they charge a few dollars for generating a card.
     Fairness in design is important, because Card Creators could
     compromise the security of the system by storing the key
     pairs they generate.
     A card creator is mostly an RSA key generator - it needs
     computing power of a 300 Mhz PC, and is constructed fairly
     cheaply. Once the voter enters their personal information
     into the machine, it spits out two cards: one with the
     public key, that is handed over to the Registrar and the
     other with the secret key and identification information
     required by the Election Authority (like the social security
     number of the voter.) The second card is known as the
     "Voting Card" and is used to validate the voter at the time
     of elections. Both cards also contain a large random number,
     known as the Voter Id. This is used throughout the voting
     process to facilitate lookups in the Register without
     compromising the privacy of the voter.
     Once all voters have handed their Voter Public Key Card over
     to the Registrar, the registration process is considered to
     be complete. As with traditional elections, there is a cut-
     off date for this process.
     On completion of registration, the Election Authority hands
     the Register over to all the competitors. The competitors
     then check every 1 in 1000 entries (or more according to
     their capacity) to ensure that they belong to a legitimate
     voter, i.e. it isn't a fake entry inserted by a corrupt
     competitor to stuff the ballot. This process is woefully
     lacking in elections of today, and a hence a major vector
     for election fraud. Mathematics can do little to alleviate
     the dangers of registering fake voters, but competitors who
     depend on the correctness of the Register and raise funds
     for the purpose can easily perform this task. Register
     verification would be a lucrative business for independent
     professional services organizations, so it is not hard to
     imagine such organizations sprouting up to assume delegation
     of this responsibility.
     The competitors also put the Register on the Internet before
     the election so that voters can ensure their voter key is
     present in all copies of the Register. When requested, each
     competing party provides a digitally signed proof that the
     voter is registered to vote, i.e. their key is present in
     the Register. The voter, if denied the right to vote, can
     take this proof to a court of law. A pre-voting verification
     of eligibility limits the kind of fiasco that occurred in
     Florida during the Presidential elections of 2000, where a
     large number of people were denied vote.
     Validation
     In most electronic voting protocols, there exists the notion
     of the "Validator" - a party that holds the Register and
     validates voters during the election. In Athens, the
     competing parties, that were handed a copy of the Register
     in the previous step, all serve as Validators. Athens,
     therefore, is a multi-validator system. It is reasonable to
     assume that independents or fiscally constrained parties
     would team up and have a single Validator represent them.
     Validators are connected to the Internet and run Validation
     software, that accepts validation requests over a TCP port.
     The Validators are firewall'ed off to accept data only from
     certain IP addresses. The Electronic Voting Machines talk to
     the Validators via a Proxy. EVMs could theoretically talk
     directly to Validators, but the reasons for using a proxy
     will become apparent later. The Proxy is operated by the
     Election Authority and observed by representatives from all
     competing parties.
     Validators have their own RSA key pair, the public portion
     of which is published widely over the Internet. They also
     maintain two lists (other than the Register). This is the
     list of voters who have casted a vote and a list of
     corresponding validation requests.
     Before the commencement of the election, the Election
     Authority chooses a a random number which is known as the
     "Election Number". The only property of this number is its
     uniqueness to the election - it should not have been used in
     a previous election. The Election Number is distributed to
     all Validators.
     Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) used in Athens are quite
     unlike Diebold's or the ones used in the Indian elections.
     Athens' EVMs are simply "agents" that vote on behalf of the
     voter. Each EVM has an Id and a RSA key pair. The public
     part of the EVM key is published widely over the Internet.
     Communications initiated by the EVM are signed with EVMs
     secret key. The elections are considered formally commenced,
     when the Validators broadcast the Election Number and their
     public keys to EVMs via the Proxy.
     The Athens Voting Protocol
     The voter enters a private booth and swipes their Voting
     Card on the EVM. The EVM reads the secret key and the Voter
     Id off the Card. The EVM has a little printer attached to
     it, much like a cash register receipt printer, on which it
     prints out the Voter Id. It the sends the voter Id off to
     the Validators via the proxy to initiate a "voting session"
     on behalf of the voter. If the voter has already casted a
     vote, Validators return a "proof" of previously casted vote.
     The proof and its implications are discussed a little later.
     If there's no previous vote, the Validators send a positive
     acknowledgment and the EVM asks the voter to cast a ballot.
     The voter enters their vote using the on-screen display. The
     EVM concatenates the Voter's choice with the Election Number
     (EN) and the result is encrypted with a secret key (randomly
     generated) using a symmetric cipher like AES. The encrypted
     ballot is then blinded. At this point, the EVM has:
             Voter Id +
             Blind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))
     The blinded ballot is then signed with the voter's secret
     key. The EVM also signs the EN with the Voter's key. The
     EVM now has:
             Voter Id +
             VoterSignature(EN) +
             VoterSignature(Blind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))) +
             Blind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))
     The EVM sends the signed, blinded ballot over to the the
     Proxy, that sends it to all Validators. Upon receipt, a
     Validator looks up the public key corresponding to the Voter
     Id and uses it to check the voter signature. If the voter
     signature is valid the Validator signs the blind with its
     own key. It adds the Voter Id to the list of voters who have
     casted a vote and keeps, in another list, the original
     blinded request, the signed EN, and the timestamp of request
     as a proof of the casted vote. It sends the signed blinded
     ballot back to the Proxy, that forwards it to the
     originating EVM. The data packet contains:
         EVM Id +
         Voter Id +
         ValidatorSignature(Blind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN)))
     If the Validator can't validate the signature, it sends a
     VERIFY_FAILURE error to the EVM:
         EVM Id +
         Voter Id +
         VERIFY_FAILURE +
         ValidatorSignature(
             VERIFY_FAILURE +
             Blind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))
         )
     If the Validator can't find the Voter Id, it sends an
     INVALID_VOTERID_FAILURE error to the EVM:
         EVM Id +
         Voter Id +
         INVALID_VOTERID_FAILURE +
         ValidatorSignature(
             INVALID_VOTERID_FAILURE +
             Blind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))
         )
     As described earlier, if the Voter has already casted a
     vote, the Validator sends a proof of the vote, which
     contains:
         REPEAT_VOTE_FAILURE +
         Proof
         Where Proof is:
         EVM Id +
         Voter Id +
         Request_Timestamp +
         PreviousBlind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN)) +
         VoterSignature(PreviousBlind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))) +
         VoterSignature(EN)
     Once the EVM has received responses from all Validators, it
     informs the voter that their vote was casted. If all
     Validators sent a positive response the EVM prints out the
     message "Vote successfully casted" (immediately following
     the previously printed Voter Id), and instructs the voter to
     take the printed receipt. If any of the Validators return a
     failure, the EVM prints out all Validator responses,
     including the steps for unblinding and decrypting the
     original vote. A little later I will demonstrate how this
     receipt can be used to detect various types of tampering and
     attacks on the system. For now, we will assume validation
     was successful. For a successful validation, the EVM removes
     the blind and is left with ``n' validated encrypted ballots:
         Validator_1_Signature(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))) ..
         Validator_n_Signature(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))) +
                               Encrypted(Ballot . EN)
     This data encapsulates a secret vote by a voter whose
     eligibility has been attested to by all competing
     Validators, none of whom know the way in which the vote was
     cast. Additionally, any independent party can now confirm
     the integrity of the vote by checking the Validator
     signatures.
     The EVM places the signatures, the ballot and the secret key
     used to encrypted the Ballot on a "Tally Queue". For votes
     that failed, the failure messages are placed on the Tally
     Queue instead.
     Tallying
     When the Election is over, several pieces of data are
     published over the Internet in a public forum that has
     properties of a Usenet group (ie. published information
     can't be retracted). First, the Validators publish their
     list of Voter Ids that casted a vote along with "proofs" of
     validation request, where the proof is exactly the same as
     one described above. This includes all the data on the two
     lists maintained by the Validators.
     Once Validators have published their lists, the proxy opens
     up the constraints on EVM communication, such that they can
     all talk to each other and read and write in the public
     forum. The proxy informs EVMs of this event and sends them a
     list of IP addresses all EVMs. The EVMs then participate in
     an Onion Routing protocol[12] to publish the encrypted
     ballots and Validator signatures on these ballots from their
     Tallying Queue. Once encrypted votes and Validator
     signatures are faithfully transmitted over to the public
     forum, EVMs enter a second round of Onion routing to publish
     the AES passwords to decrypt the votes. The Onion Routing
     protocol strips the origination information, so it becomes
     impossibly hard to corelate votes to EVMs, thereby making
     the publication anonymous.
     At this point, all data required to do a tally is available
     publically. It should be noted that almost everything that
     transpires during the election process, with the exception
     of the data that links the voters to their votes, is made
     public at the end of the election. This level of
     transparency is one of the greatest benefits of a well
     designed electronic voting system.
     In Athens, the tallying is done by the Election Authority,
     but anyone equiped with Tallying software can check the
     tally independently. Athens tally is straightforward. Ballots
     that have valid signatures from _all_ Validators are
     selected as countable votes. These are decrypted with the
     published AES secret keys, votes are separated from the
     Election Number, and counted to produce a final tally.
     Security of Athens
     To analyse the security of Athens, I will show how various
     common attacks are made trivially detectable by the Athens
     architecture.
     Denial of Vote Attacks
     The pre-election registration verification keeps the
     Registrar honest. If the registrar drops people from the
     Register, there's a high probability that the drop will be
     detected and the Registrar will be answerable in a court of
     law. Since competing parties are independently undertaking the
     verification, it is in everyones interest to keep the
     process honest.
     During the election, two different types of denial attacks
     are possible. The first attack is where one of the
     competitors know (based on the Voter Id, or region), the way
     in which the voter will cast a vote. Outspoken supporters,
     representatives and volunteers of a party are vulnerable to
     this attack. A competing Validator could try to deny them
     the vote by raising one of the three possible errors:
     INVALID_VOTERID_FAILURE, VERIFY_FAILURE or
     REPEAT_VOTE_FAILURE.
     To protect from the INVALID_VOTERID_FAILURE denial attack, a
     copy of the register is published widely prior to the
     commencement of the elections. A receipt generated by the
     EVM with a valid Voter Id and an INVALID_VOTERID_FAILURE
     notice is an easily established proof of Validators'
     corruption. VERIFY_FAILURE is also trivially established
     with help of the positive validation requests from competing
     Validators (also on the receipt), the public Register and
     the voter's Voting Card.
     The attack based on the third error, REPEAT_FAILURE is more
     interesting. What if a Validator refuses to Validate a vote
     by claiming that the Voter has already voted? In that case,
     the Validator must provide a proof of the previous
     Validation request. Since the proof contains a signature
     made on both the EM and the Blinded ballot by Voter's secret
     key, the Validator cannot provide such a proof with the
     knowledge of the key - which is unavailable to the
     Validator. This is why Athens requires Validators to keep a
     copy of all validation requests, and conducts the validation
     process in 2-steps, so the first validation request can't be
     used as a proof. Also, since the Election Number is encoded
     in the ballot, and a signed EN is part of the proof,
     validation requests from previous elections can't be cited
     as proofs. An incorrect proof is easily verifiable by the
     EVM as well as the voter and a court of law with help of the
     printed receipt.
     A different kind of denial of vote attack can be mounted by
     the EVMs. In this attack the EVMs withhold publication of
     validated votes. However, such withholding is easily
     discovered in Athens because the list of proofs published
     by the Validators indicate the number of casted and
     verified votes.
     Ballot Stuffing Attacks
     There are several ways in which an attacker can try to stuff
     ballots. The first method, that was discussed earlier, is by
     registering fake voters during the registration process.
     Since the Register is open to independent scrutiny by all
     competitors, the risks of adding fake voters is high and
     hence discouraged.
     Another ballot stuffing attack is to cast votes for
     absentees. This attack is very hard in Athens, since it
     requires the knowledge of absentees' secret keys.
     The third way to stuff the ballot is for an eligible voter
     to cast multiple votes. This is made impossible in Athens
     with help of Validation proofs. Even when the Validators
     of n-1 colluding parties (where n is the number of
     competing parties), validate multiple requests from
     Mallory (a colluding voter), the non-colluding party is
     able to present a proof of Mallory's first vote and deny
     all subsequent requests with impunity. The Tallying
     process requires an affirmation from _all_ Validators, so
     such votes are not counted.
     Vote Alteration Attacks
     The Athens protocol requires that EVMs act honestly on the
     behalf of the Voter. A corrupt EVM could easily display to
     the voter that it has casted a vote their choice, but
     actually cast the vote for another party. This attack would
     be impossible if the EVM was required to print out a
     receipt of every vote that included the blinded ballot,
     signed by Voter's secret key, the steps to unblind it and
     the secret AES key with which the actual vote was
     encrypted. The voter could then look up the encrypted
     ballot after it was published and ensure the vote was cast
     and counted correctly. Doing this, however, would leave the
     voter with a proof of vote that could lead to vote coercion
     or vote buying.
     It is not sufficient to blindly trust the EVM either. Code
     reviews, or open source development of the EVM software
     (while should be encouraged) do not guarantee that the code
     running on the deployed EVM is the one that was reviewed. To
     keep the EVMs honest, Athens implements a sub-protocol for
     EVM verification.
     All competing parties add a few thousand fake voters to
     their own copy of the Register, and generate corresponding
     voting cards. These voting cards are then used by designated
     verifiers (volunteers) to cast arbitrary votes (usually for
     the party that runs the Validator) to test the EVMs. The
     volunteers are normal, eligible voters with multiple voting
     cards - they first vote with their real card, and then pull
     out the fake ones to run a series of tests. When the
     designated verifier casts a vote with one of the faked card,
     the vote is verified correctly by the Verifying Validator
     (the one who has the fake keys on it copy of the Register),
     while other n-1 Validators decline validation with an
     INVALID_VOTERID_FAILURE. This causes the EVM to print out
     the entire transaction, down to the selection of the actual
     vote that the EVM tried to validate.
     If the EVM is systematically altering votes, the designated
     verifier ends up with a receipt showing a selection that was
     different from his actual selection. If the EVM attempts to
     cover up its deception by printing a receipt that says "Vote
     successfully casted", the designated verified immediately
     knows the EVM is lying, since the n-1 Validators would have
     failed the verification. If the EVM tries to back paddle and
     cast a correct vote after it receives the
     INVALID_VOTERID_FAILUREs, the duplicate vote attempt is
     detected by (at least) the Verifying Validator, who responds
     with a proof of the previous validation request. Unable to
     differentiate a normal voter from a designated verifier
     before sending a verification request, the EVM is forced to
     act honestly.
     Athens requires the physical constraint of using a proxy for
     all communications originating from the EVMs, to ensure EVMs
     have no out-of-bound, out-of-protocol communications with
     Validators and other parties. This provides a single,
     focused point of observation for the competing parties, and
     can be performed fairly easily with a protocol decoder.
     In sum, Athens uses cryptographic primitives to build an
     electronic voting system that ties in the processes of
     registration, voting, and tallying into a protocol that is
     secure, anonymous and truly transparent. Since all aspects
     of the protocol are verifiable the potential for fraud is
     greatly reduced. Even more importantly, open systems like
     Athens inspire confidence and promote participation in the
     election process - the very foundation of democracy.
     Partial Observability
     "Participation" brings us to the one of the topics that
     originally led to my interest in electronic voting. I know
     many intelligent and politically sensitive Indians who have
     never casted a vote in Indian democratic elections. I am
     one of them. My reason for electoral inaction is not
     apathy, but simple statistics. In a country of a billion
     people, my vote doesn't really count. To be more precise,
     if one party wins by 80% then my vote, in either direction,
     is not useful. However, if a party that I don't support
     happens to win by a small margin, my vote (and those of
     others like me) could have made all the difference. Of
     course, I have no way of knowing this till it is too late.
     I could pay attention to gallop and exit polls, but those
     can be quite wrong as demonstrated in the Indian general
     elections earlier this year.
     It is no surprise that the voter turnout in what is
     perceived to be a hotly contested election is higher than
     expected. A comprehensive IDEA survey[13] on voter turnout
     failed to find corelations between turnout and various
     factors they studied, but they found that "there does seem
     to be a clear link between voter turnout and the
     competitiveness of electoral politics in a political
     system. In the 542 elections where the largest party won
     less than half of the votes turnout was a full 10% higher
     than the 263 elections where a single party won over 50% of
     the popular vote."
     Publishing partial results is a tactical nightmare in paper
     based or electronic counter based elections. However, a
     system like Athens could enter the Tally phase several times
     during the election at no additional cost to provide an
     "intermediate tally". The frequency and timing of the
     intermidiate tallies could be function of the size of the
     electorate and number of uncounted votes - large enough to
     protect the anonymity of the voters and small enough to
     provide an updating sense of the final result. The
     intermediate tallies could be broadcastd on TV, Radio and
     the Internet (much like Stock tickers), and would functions
     as "get out the vote" campaigns, to encourage the
     statistically informed to go out and vote.
     This property of elections that I like to call "partial
     observability", could greatly boost participation and
     otherwise alter the dynamics of the election process. It is
     just one of the ways in which electronic voting could
     qualitative change the elections and democracy.

More Evidence The Vote Was Rigged
From Wayne Nash
I don't want rain on the parade but I am getting quite a few emails from various sources citing possible irregularities with the voting process. So, I did a little research myself on the net to see what I could find. As a political scientist I could not resist.
Regardless of the veracity of any claim to possible irregularities I suggest that this question of legitimacy of the process needs to be addressed if everyone casting their vote is to feel that their vote is being properly counted. No one can feel disenfranchised in a real democracy. Otherwise, you end up with a dictatorship and not a democracy at all.
Unless BOTH sides feel the system is verifiable then you may end up with a banana republic 'democracy'. This is not question of who won the election. It is a matter of much greater importance; the legitimacy of the democratic process itself.
Here are a couple of sites which address the issue:
1. 2. On this last web site I found this interesting bit of information:
"Various people sent me mail saying that it is awfully fishy that the exit polls and final results were substantially different in some places. I hope someone will follow this up and actually do a careful analysis. Does anyone know of a Website containing all the exit poll data? If we go to computerized voting without a paper trail and the machines can be set up to cheat, that is the end of our democracy. Switching 5 votes per machine is probably all it would take to throw an election and nobody would ever see it unless someone compares the computer totals and exit polls. I am still very concerned about the remark of Walden O'Dell a Republican fund raiser and CEO of Diebold, which makes voting machines saying he would deliver Ohio for President Bush. Someone (not me) should look into this carefully. The major newspapers actually recounted all the votes in Florida last time. Maybe this year's project should be looking at the exit polls. If there are descrepancies between the exit polls and the final results in touch-screen counties but not in paper-ballot counties, that would be a signal. At the very least it could be a good masters thesis for a political science student. The Open voting consortium is a group addressing the subject of verifiable voting."
Could there be a possible problem here? Let's see...
* In states where there were paper ballots the results exactly matched the exit polls.
* In states where there were only electronic 'touch-screen' paperless voting machines Bush showed an inexplicable 5-8 point or more difference from the polls, contradicting otherwise accurate exit polls.
* The software used in these voting machines is so sophisticated that you can't even check out the programming because it disappears leaving nothing to verify, no source code, no nothing.
Below are 3 articles explaining how these E-voting programs work. The man who published these articles is apparently an expert on this E-voting subject and a computer scientist.

* SoCalDem has done a statistical analysis... ...on several swing states, and EVERY STATE that has EVoting but no paper trails has an unexplained advantage for Bush of around +5% when comparing exit polls to actual results.
* In EVERY STATE that has paper audit trails on their EVoting, the exit poll results match the actual results reported within the margin of error.
* Analysis of the polling data vs actual data and voting systems supports the hypothesis that evoting may be to blame in the discrepancies.
* The media was a bit taken aback that the results didn't match the exit polls AT ALL. Most of the commentators were scratching their head in disbelief at the results. The media has gracefully claimed they "just got it wrong."
Some examples?
Kerry leads Female voters by 7%, Bush leads male voters by 7%. Male vs. Female voter turnout is 47% M, 53% F. That means Kerry statistically has a 7% edge in exit polling in Wisconsin.
Actual results however show Bush ahead by 1%, an unexplained difference of 8%.
Kerry leads in the exit polls by a clear margin, but is still behind in the reported results. This state is even closer.
Actual is just 1% favor of Bush. Exit polls show Kerry with a wider margin. Women favored Kerry by 8% here out of 52% of total voters. Men favored Bush by just 6% out of 48% of total voters. Actual reported results don't match exit polling AT ALL in Nevada.
Easy Programming?
According to the programmer cited above here is how easy it is to "make magic" We need COUNTERS - (B) = Bush; (K) = Kerry; (V) = Vote; (T) =Tally
1. If V = B, add 1 to B
2. If T = 8, add 1 to B; Clear T; Skip 3
3. If V = K, add 1 to K; Add 1 to T
This extremely simple bit of programming would shift 12% of the vote from Kerry to Bush, it would defy exit polls, and it would make it look like Bush had a huge popular win.
Feel free to pass this on to your Republican and Democratic friends. If you are American, this should concern you regardless of who won this election or wins future elections. If your process is flawed your democracy is flawed and everything you believe in is on the line. I am sure that people on the ground are acting in good faith and voting according to their values and beliefs. It is the people at the top that concern me.
