@_subject: Tails prevents MAC changes as design feature 
It seems that you do:
Geographical movement is revealed by device leaks before Tails boots.
The OUI is not spoofed when using Tails.
A new MAC every Tails session on low traffic networks raises alarms.
Network device quantity limitations causes connection problems eventually.
Clearly, the current MAC spoofing protocol, which violates every Tails
User Goal, puts Tails users at risk.
The ideal tools:
- Host machine(s) with no internal network devices
- External PCI/USB network card(s)
- Tails on USB Stick(s)
The ideal process:
- Power on host machine
- Press and hold keys to access EFI Boot Menu
- Plug Tails USB Stick into host machine
- Select Tails system drive as it appears
- Create Administrative Account at Greeter as Tails boots
- Set custom MAC address(s) at Greeter as Tails boots
- Start Tails
- Plug in External PCI/USB network card(s)
- Have Network Manager recognize, then assign, the appropriate MAC
- Connect to network
Please consider this wonderful case and directly support the changing of
MAC address OUI and NIC.
Not every one is you.

I have issues with network interfaces, like wlan0, changing back to what
the system wants.   This is not what I want.
- Start Tails (MAC Address Spoofing: On)
- Plug in network card (wlan0)
- macchanger assigns wlan0 random MAC string
- Bring wlan0 down
- Set new MAC string (macchanger or other tools)
- Bring wlan0 up
- macchanger changes new MAC string to Tails' NIC-only MAC string
This did not happen in older versions and may very well be a bug.
If not, what development decisions have gone into making this change and
why are they better than me changing my MAC and having the system
respect that?
Why continue with the insecure model of changing NIC only?  Willfully
leaking network device manufacturer info is irresponsible.
