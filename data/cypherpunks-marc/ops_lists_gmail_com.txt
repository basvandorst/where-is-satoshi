Er I'm sorry but do you mean joeschmoe type
emails, or joeschmoe type emails?
If megaupload's corporate email was siezed to provide due diligence in
such a prosecution - it would quite probably not constitute private

I would agree.  They've dotted every i and crossed every t here.
This will inevitably be followed by a prosecution of some sort and/or
there's also scope for Megaupload to sue the USG for restitution.
It'll be interesting to see how this pans out - especially wrt any
safe harbor provisions in the DMCA for providers (which do have a
provision for due diligence being exercised etc).
Probable cause for seizure should have been easy to establish - no
shortage of warez, cp etc on these free upload sites.

Sure. Is there any point in reinventing a wheel?  Multiple different
silo'd communities have ever been useful - and also the biggest
stumbling block for coordination.
Clearinghouses at a national level aren't particularly new either -
the aussie telecom regulator ACMA set one up for spam / security
reports with various local service providers and its been doing just
fine for the past few years.   At a basic level, aggregating +
anonymizing feeds from various data sources and sending alerts to
SPs.. and cooperation only builds upwards from there.

I have a lot of respect for what REN-ISAC does but it doesn't nearly
have the sort of coverage this project appears to be looking at.

Sure.  But if what Gen.Alexander says comes off - this looks like a
US-CERT or other clearinghouse to handle sensitive data of all sorts
(critical infrastructure attacks, sensitive data leaks / breaches etc)
I can see where DShield - and various other players in similar, but
heavily silo'd spaces - might coordinate with a neutral centralized

I think what Gen.Alexander said and what the reporter missed out is
that they're interested in malware traffic flows, bot C&Cs etc, rather
than smtp received headers

And so their bush league by itself was responsible for all the penetrations
that mandiant says they did?  Which shows that they don't have to be
particularly smart, just a bit smarter than their average spear phish or
other attack's victim.

Nanog setting their list server up to mandate that envelope from matches
header from should take care of this .. I see the envelope being whatever,
nobody type stuff more often than not, in all these

Very true. The objection is more that the exploits are aimed at civilian
rather than (or, more accurately, as well as) military / government /
beltway targets.
Which makes the alleged chinese strategy rather more like financing jehadis
to suicide bomb and shoot up hotels and train stations, rather than any
sort of disciplined warfare or espionage.

Net net - what we have here is, so far, relatively low tech exploits with a
huge element of brute force, and the only innovation being in the delivery
mechanism - very well crafted spear phishes
They don't particularly need to hide in a location where they're literally
bulletproof (considering how many crimes have the death penalty in china,
said penalty being enforced by a bullet to the head and your family billed
for the bullet, if I remember correctly)
Now there's a light shone on it all, despite the official denial, you'll
simply see this office building shift to an even more anonymous business
park halfway across the country (or maybe inside an army base that people
just can't wander into and photograph), and the exploits will simply start
to cover their traces better.
Sure they'll evolve - let them.  The point here is that they're going to
evolve anyway if we let them operate with impunity from a location where
they're bulletproof.

Part of the entire 'chinese l337 hxx0r spy' 1st complex is apparently the
