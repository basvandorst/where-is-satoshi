Azucena is the Mexican woman who followed her heart
on the road to her destiny wherever that way leads.
This is the "true" story, transformed by art, of a village girl
whose heart was stolen by a macho rodeo bull-rider.
the story is still only at scene 19 ; the story so far is that Azucena, a sweet sixteen year old poor girl, whose mother is abused by her alcoholic father. The inexperienced teen/ager is seduced by a young handsome buck, who came to her her town for a rodeo;  Arturo rides a big black bull in one of the early scenes of the novel.
The boy and the girl meet
and he picks her up
and before the evening is over
he has convinced her
to leave her fathers house
and come away with him;
she is swayed
and heartfilled at his protestations of love
mixed with suppressed sexual urging
his desperate and empassioned flattery
  go right to her pretty head;
so she falls for his line
- it was the first time she had been told such fervant words
and gives her heart to him.
That night deflowers her in the deserted bullring and in the morning they head off in a delightful bus ride to his home village with the colorful local folks; arriving at his home town, he shows her off to his friends, takes her and installs her in his hovel, they are very happy the both of them.  The father and the mother, the three gossipy sisters arrive to set up the kitchen situation for their "sister in law".
That is where the story is at scene 19 there are more than a hundred scenes yet to play.
The scenes are NOT too long to read them; most of them are not much more than half a page.
