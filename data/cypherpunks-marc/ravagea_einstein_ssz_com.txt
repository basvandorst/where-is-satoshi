Anti-mob law invoked in sex cases
March 25, 2002
WASHINGTON: Lawyers are invoking a statute previously used to round up crime bosses in a new legal nightmare for the Catholic church over child abuse by priests.	
Claiming the church hierarchy is involved in a conspiracy of silence to protect priests who abuse children, the suit filed in Hannibal, Missouri, comes under the Racketeering Influence and Corrupt Organisations Act and targets former Florida bishop Anthony O'Connell, who resigned this month after admitting to molesting a seminary student in the 1970s.
The law includes provisions for civil lawsuits when someone is harmed by a "pattern" of illegal activity.

ISPs forced to spy on email
Kate Mackenzie
MARCH 22, 2002
NEW Zealand's Government plans to force telcos and ISPs to install equipment allowing police to eavesdrop on phone calls and emails.
New Zealand's Associate Minister of Justice Paul Swain confirmed the requirements would be introduced as part of the Telecommunications (Interception Capability) Bill that was being drafted. It would go before the Law and Order Select Committee and be opened to public comment before it could be introduced.
"What I'm outlining today is how we expect that to happen," Mr Swain said If passed, the laws would give network operators and ISPs between 18 months and five years to comply with the requirements. The Government would pay for upgrades to existing networks, but companies would be expected to foot the cost for new builds.
A spokeswoman for Mr Swain said it had not yet been determined what technology would be used, or whether all companies would have to use the same type of interception technology.
"How it's physically done yet to be worked out," she said.
Mr Swain said the laws would bring New Zealand into line with other countries including Australia, the UK and the US.
"It doesn't mean that it's identical to those laws, it just means it's on equal footing," the spokeswoman said.
The laws would also target hacking crimes, which were not covered by any specific laws in New Zealand.

Myanmar goes wild with email
Correspondents in Yangon
MARCH 19, 2002
YANGON: Some 10,000 new email accounts will be handed out to members of the public in Myanmar, where until now only 4000 carefully selected citizens have had access to the technology.
The Myanmar Times reported the email accounts would go online within the next few weeks to users in the capital Yangon and the northern city of It did not say who they would go to, but the recipients are likely to be privileged figures or prominent businesspeople in the military-
controlled nation, where access to all forms of communication is severely Bagan Cybertech, a semi-government organisation, will issue the accounts as well as provide internet access to government departments and a limited number of other organisations.
The new email users will also have access to some 800 sites on the web as well as about 50 on the local intranet, the company's director Htein Win says.
"The issue of these new email accounts will see a steep rise in internet usage. Since 1997, Myanma Posts and Telecommunication was the only email and internet service provider and accounts were limited," he says.
Travel agents and tour operators, IT companies, exporters and importers had expressed interest, he says.

Date Fri, 22 Mar 2002 08:28:56 -0500 (EST)
MUERTE AL ESTADO Y VIVA LA ANARQUIA!!! The return of the Durutti Brigade
About 5.000 people participated in the red and black bloc in the
demonstration of 16th March, against the european summit. There were blac
bloc groups, libertarians, CNT, squatters, many anticapitalist and activists, that marched together with red and black flags and slogans. The direct action against symbols of the state and capital police stations, dozens of banks, military palace and judicial palace,
offices of authoritative trade union), the confrontations with the who used rubber bullets, the attacks against their squads and barricades and the presence of thousands of people refusing to run away and
keeping on shouting all together VIVA LA ANARQUIA, POLICIA ASESINA, in all
the difficult moments the police was charging, created a situation, an atmosphere of fiesta and revolt, of rage and revenge for the
repression in the 15th March anticapitalist demo and for all all the
repression, arrests and tortures of our comrades who faught all over world, from Seattle and Prague, to Gotemburg and Genoa. It was an inspiring experience to be among thousands of people marching together in
solidarity, despite the rubber bullets flying in the air and the
helicopters above our heads. During the riots, people from the bloc didn4t participa It is true that civil police made arrests inside the and that was the purpose of them being there. Many civil police who recognized by demonstrators were beaten and chased away. There were also
confrontations with members of the "demonstration police" who stood in
front of banks and police and tried to prevent comrades violently. In
Barcelona it was shown once more that the struggle against global
dictatorship of state and capital is not retreating by repression, it is
not sold to the reformists and to social pacification in front of the
continuous crimes of global domination. The struggle continues, the forces of the state, uncontrolled from the manipulation of those believe in old and new models of authority, parliaments and NGO4s, that the only limit is a world without states and borders, without
exploitation and oppression. We carry a new world in our hearts, and we
make it alive through our efforts to destroy the existing hierarchical repressive status. We make it alive the moments we fight back, the we stand together against repression, the moments that we share struggle for freedom with all the damned and oppressed people, all comrades in revolt. From the streets of Genoa to Argentina, from children of Indifadah to the fighting people in Bolivia, in Colombia, in
