what I saw today lavabit.com
My Fellow Users,
I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit
in crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly ten
years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit. After significant soul
searching, I have decided to suspend operations. I wish that I could
legally share with you the events that led to my decision. I cannot. I
feel you deserve to know whatâs going on--the first amendment is
supposed to guarantee me the freedom to speak out in situations like
this. Unfortunately, Congress has passed laws that say otherwise. As
things currently stand, I cannot share my experiences over the last
six weeks, even though I have twice made the appropriate requests.
Whatâs going to happen now? Weâve already started preparing the
paperwork needed to continue to fight for the Constitution in the
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. A favorable decision would allow me
resurrect Lavabit as an American company.
This experience has taught me one very important lesson: without
congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would
_strongly_ recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a
company with physical ties to the United States.
Ladar Levison
Owner and Operator, Lavabit LLC

Hash: SHA512
Hi all,
Just an idea. In theory : is it possible to implement bitcoin wallet
into tor-relay and TBB 1) ? TBB users could tip tor-relays (f.e. 1
satoshi for guard and middle relay,  3 satoshi for exit-node per
circuit). Running tor-relays could be profitable or at least cheaper.
1).I think Cody Wilson is working on a bitcoin wallet in a browser.
