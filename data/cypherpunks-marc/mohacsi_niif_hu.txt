@_subject: RE: Adding GPS location to IPv6 header 
It should not be in any IPv6 packet. It has to be in an upper layer In worst case. Host should have an option to sending location update - probably not in IP headers, but upper layer protocol.
I suggest an upper layer protocol. Something like HTTP, TCP or UDP option. The server can initiate a carry, and a client can decide to answer with location information.
I prefer application and at most the transport layer protocol extension.
