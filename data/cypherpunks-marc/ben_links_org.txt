Surely this is fundamental to threshold secret sharing - until you reach
the threshold, you have not reduced the cost of an attack?

I didn't say that (that site may say it, I don't know, I haven't been
keeping that site updated). In fact, Google is building it, right now.
CT applies to public certificates. By definition, these are not
private. If CAcert wants to issue private certs in a CT world, then I
suspect some changes will be needed...
Public certificates are already a public spectacle. I have no idea
what Bitcoin has to do with this.
CT is not an arbiter of anything, it is an audit trail.
I think we can move faster than that. CAs have already signed up to CT.
I do not agree that that is a goal.
The point of CT is precisely to make it possible to find MITM certs
even when you are not the victim.

And there's also the issue that there's really no way you can force
the recipient to delete the file. A point they even illustrate later
in the article:
"A few weeks ago, it was used in South Sudan to transmit a video of
brutality that took place at a vehicle checkpoint. Once the recording
was made, it was sent encrypted to Europe using Silent Text, and
within a few minutes, it was burned off of the sender=92s device. Even
if authorities had arrested and searched the person who transmitted
it, they would never have found the footage on the phone. Meanwhile,
the film, which included location data showing exactly where it was
taken, was already in safe hands thousands of miles away=97without
having been intercepted along the way=97where it can eventually be used
to build a case documenting human rights abuses."
i.e, _not_ burned by the recipient.
So, is the claim that they've invented delete?
This sounds just like step one in another Haystack-like fiasco.

I do not have an obligation to work around all your broken decisions.
Currently, my advice is that you probably should not run Linux if you need
strong randomness.

I haven't studied the Linux PRNG, but my casual understanding is it does
not deal well with useless input. This is obviously a defect.

What "external" crypto can you not fix? Windows? Then don't use Windows.
You can fix any crypto in Linux or FreeBSD.
So what? BSD's definition is superior. Linux should fix their RNG. Or these
people who you think should implement their own should. Or they could just
switch to BSD.
All entropy feeds are safe.
Yet they're both selling it.
Again: so what?

That's terrible advice. Implement your own crypto of any sort widely leads
to complete fail, as we see repeatedly.
Also, if there are other sources, why are they not being fed in to the
system PRNG?

That is totally not Godel's second incompleteness theorem. It is certainly
possible to prove things in formal systems. This is not a "minor handwave",
it is pure bullshit.

There's only one sentence in this whole thing that's in any way relevant to
the crypto debate, and it's this one:
But for some reason this non-use of encryption has led to a difficult
position for those advocating encryption. Wat?
You might as well say that in the wake of the Paris attacks, WH wants to
talk to people about global warming. Or the kitten shortage.
