@_subject: Transparency in the maritime industry! 
The Prestige, Exxon Valdez, Castor, and Erika accidents made a significant impact to both the environment and the maritime industry.
The environmental and financial repercussions caused by these accidents
will be felt for years to come. Several initiatives have been and are being started, including the proposal and enactment of extensive legislation, requiring more transparency in the maritime industry.
The ability for Flag States, Classification Societies, Port State Control Authorities and other concerned parties (including those mentioned below) to have access to vessel condition reports will enhance transparency and contribute to the prevention of these accidents. It is within this environment that the concept of the TransparentSea Reporting Solution was conceived (TRS).  TRS was developed and written in collaboration with a major Ship Management company and a leading Maritime Administration to provide the functionality required by the maritime industry. What type of reports can TRS be used for?
Repair Reports:	
Classification Societies, Ship Owners, Ship Managers, Flag States, Port State Control Authorities. Insurance Underwriters, Accident Investigation Teams
Drydock Reports:     Ship Owners, Ship Managers, Flag States,Classification Societies, Charterers, Port State Control Authorities
