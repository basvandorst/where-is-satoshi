The US missed a real trick when Khatami got into power in 1997; he had a huge swell of popular support behind him, and with significant US backing he could probably have outmaneuvered the conservatives and made some real changes.  A truly democratic Persian state would be a huge boost to stability in the Middle East, not to mention the psyops benefits of having a poster-child for moderate, tolerant Islam.  Instead, we had the 'axis of evil' hogwash, and lo: the conservatives marginalise Khatami, and we're back to abayas, beards and jihad.
    Of course the more cynical might think that this lack of stability is entirely deliberate on the part of the US.  Better to have pet tyrants who require American military aid to suppress dissent, and hence ensure ongoing access to oil fields, or else loonies who spit vitriol about The Great Satan and ensure their own irrelevance (in which case the oil stays underground, waiting for a more economically realistic owner).  Stable regimes with the ability to sell oil on the world stage might start throwing their geopolitical weight around.  Venezuela, anyone?

I certainly wouldn't argue that US policy in Indochina was anything other than a fiasco, nor that the current misadventure in the Middle East will be spared the same fate, but the Chinese had another very important reason to back the Khmer Rouge against Vietnam - Russia.
    The Soviets supplied heavy military and financial aid to Vietnam, in return for an anticipated naval base through which they could extend their power into the South Seas.  They never got the base - the Vietnamese played them like a fiddle - but the threat was enough for the PRC to view Vietnam as an enemy-by-proxy, and so to back the Khmer Rouge.
    In addition, the whole of Indochina was (and is) a clusterfuck of rivalries and feuds going back centuries.  The (relatively) sudden appearance of a bunch of new regimes, all with revolutionary mindsets through which to apply their old vendettas, probably made the bloodshed inevitable - although US intervention undoubtedly made it worse.

Tor moves your data through the cloud untraceably, but you have to store it
somewhere. If you're storing small amounts of data (encryption keys maybe?)
you could use a dht, and there are a few good open source ones.
If you're talking about storing more than a few K, then you run into the
problem of who pays the disk space for me to store my 500GB art film
collection? :-)
The difference between an encryption key and the key to a locked drawer is
that the drawer may be smashed opn while the encrypted file might not be
smashable at all.
Again, one wonders if a truly deniable form of TOR-based encryption might be
possible. If I enter key number one, message one is retrieved untraceably
from the cloud. If I enter key number 2, message 2 is retrieved instead. The
tough part is that there needs to be a mixed middleware service layer inside
the cloud that can take the requests in an untraceable manner and go to the
right place to retrieve.
Or is there any easier way, given ISP records of customer activity?

So 28 days' detention without charge, more CCTV cams than the rest of

.gov.uk collection of all telephone, email and web headers hadn't
scared you away already? ;o)
The UK has the tightest government control of anywhere in the west,
and has had for a very long time.  It's just that the plutocracy has
been in charge for so long (since 1649, really), and they've been
fairly smart about it; control has been absorbed into the fabric of
society without disrupting anyone [important] too much.
There is most definitely simmering resentment amongst the populace
here, but it's going to have to get a lot worse before anyone does
anything about it.

Everyone who buys a mobile telephone will be forced to register their
identity on a national database under government plans to extend
massively the powers of state surveillance.
Phone buyers would have to present a passport or other official form
of identification at the point of purchase. Privacy campaigners fear
it marks the latest government move to create a surveillance society.
A compulsory national register for the owners of all 72m mobile phones
in Britain would be part of a much bigger database to combat terrorism
and crime. Whitehall officials have raised the idea of a register
containing the names and addresses of everyone who buys a phone in
recent talks with Vodafone and other telephone companies, insiders

@_subject: robonobo needs alpha testers 
Hello cypherpunks;
I've been working on a project that I hope will be of interest to some
on this list.  It has now reached an alpha stage and I could really
use some testers.
The project is called robonobo.  It's a music network built on a
networking layer that uses digital cash to achieve fairness and high
performance, which translates into reliably being able to stream
enough data to be able to play tracks in real time even though the
underlying network is p2p.
I am using lucre as my underlying digital cash system.  This isn't
just used as an anti-freeloader measure; nodes constantly auction off
their bandwidth, and the network uses a variant of TCP-LP to give more
bandwidth to higher bidders, allowing real-time streaming in a p2p
The app should work reasonably well, though it is still very much in
an alpha state.  It is designed to be highly scalable, but some parts
of the network are not yet finished and so have unscalable shims
holding things together.  For this reason it's invite-only at the
moment, though the source is fully available should anyone want to
poke about at it.
The project page is here:
 and an overview for
developers is here:
If anyone is interested in taking a look, please register at
 - alternatively, drop me a line and I'll send you
an invite.
Please forward this to any individuals or lists you think might be interested.

There does seem to be a swell of interest in bitcoin among
