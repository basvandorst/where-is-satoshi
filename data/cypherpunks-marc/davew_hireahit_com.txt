Sure, but this is probably just a case of using too blunt an instrument; they likely just classified "Tor" (all of it, including websites) as an unacceptable product.
Expecting mid-level management to understand the finer points of what Tor is, how it works, or the difference between the "website" and "the service" and "the protocol" isn't realistic in a world where usually the concept of a site, service and protocol are all one and the same.
