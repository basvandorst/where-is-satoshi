MaidSafe (MS) is an inadvertent (apparently due to a lack of historical
information) attempt to realize the experiment Jim McCoy, Bram Cohen, Zooko
O'Hearn and I set out to perform with Mojo Nation. They are doing this with
the advantage of the experience of bitcoin. MN was sort of Freenet +
digital currency. Unlike the file sharing systems that came before Freenet
is publication-based. Both file sharing (FS) and publication content
distribution approaches have their pros and cons.
FS is simpler but offers little or no plausible deniability about the
sharing activities. Publication offers much better deniabilty but more
complex and requires more resource commitments on the part of its users.
Both suffer from limitations based on popularity. MN tried to find a sweet
spot by adding a resource-based currency to solve the persistence problem
by paying user clients to offer storage and communication bandwidth.
Unfortunately, MN never really got off the ground, due to a lack of
funding, but it got far enough to encourage Bram to create BitTorrent and
Zooko to create Tahoe LAFS. I tried to get Bram (and some others through
client add-ons) to include some sort of digital currency to BT but it never
McCoy patented MN's content distribution systems with resource-based
currency around 2001/2. Not sure if the patent is still in force, if Jim is
even aware of MS or if he's even care if MS appears to be using MN's

My thinking, when I first proposed what are now called Warrant Canaries,
was to rely on the U.S. constitutional protection against ex post facto. In
the same way that you can never know what laws might someday be passed
which could criminalize current, lawful, behavior or speech, a service can
never know in advance if they might someday receive a warrant or NSL. Can
someone be compelled to refrain from free speech because someday that
speech might be prohibited? If more than one person is engaged in the
creation or publication of a Warrant Canary could it be viewed as a
conspiracy? Can someone be compelled to speak falsities under court order?
Until there are prosecutions which reach high enough in the Federal courts

Coming in a bit later here. To me the essence of the reasoning for the fork
is to head off the possibility that sometime in the not too distant future
the demand of bitcoin users to transact on the blockchain will exceed the
supply. That certainly might happen if fees don't respond to supply-demand
economics. Those pushing bitcoin to compete with MasterCard/VISA are, IMHO,
a bit crazy. Like shoemakers always reaching for a hammer every time these
people see a transactional opportunity they reach for the blockchain. I
think that's just plain silly. Bitcoin is not well suited for all
transactional situations. In the longer-term it seems great to replace, for
example, SWIFT and bank wires but rather poor for those that require cheap-
or ultra-cheap real-time settlement whereas some alternatives seem
tailor-made for this.
Then again maybe I am missing the key reasoning for this fork.

You have not qualified the term, "they".  Are you saying that all income
must necessarily be theft?  I would have thought people like you would have
taken the position, something like "All income over $100,000 per year is
theft".  Or, you know, limit the number of people who are called thieves
to, perhaps, the famous "1%".

donations of high-heeled shoes to the Haiti relief fund. Right? Some
wealthy people pay less taxes than that guy living in a box in a field.
Actually most wealthy people pay almost nothing percentage-wise after all
the bennies their plutocrat friends write into tax codes compared to their
UNEARNED (as in they didn't actually work or produce anything useful to
society) income.
Do you have specific statistics to back up your claims?
I have read, elsewhere, that the total Federal government expenditures, as
a portion of GDP, tends to remain relatively constant at approximately
20%.  Why should there be any tax rate dramatically greater than that?
to the wealthy.
What's wrong with what amounts to a flat tax based on what you spend?
 (arguendo; I'm a libertarian, but I can still argue these issues).
A person who makes $1 million per year doesn't use 100x the food,
transportation, housing, manufactured goods as a person who makes $10K per
year.  It sure sounds like you are, at least, assuming that taxes should be
proportional to income.  Why?
Also, you still haven't addressed the issue about the specific person cited
in the article, the guy who claimed to have been a libertarian. After all,
the thread is titled, "What % of the so-called alt-right were just plain
ol' libertarians before?"
 The entire relevance of your reference is based on what so far is
unprovable:  Was that guy actually ever a "libertarian" as most other
libertarians would recognize.  Now, I can't prove that he wasn't a
libertarian, but I find your focus on libertarians here to be misleading.
The way I see it, "alt-right" (what does that actually mean?!?) people
probably 'came from' a lot of different political philosophies.  Why do you
point solely to libertarians?
I should also add that this guy may STILL be libertarian:  He may not
believe in the "initiation of force or fraud" against his fellow person,
the "non-initiation of force or fraud principle".  (NIOFF).  That he may
have other identifiable beliefs might be interesting, but at the same time
wouldn't have to be damning of him.  For instance, hypothetically an
"alt-right" person might believe that American government has been used,
for many years, to allow certain groups to sponge off the rest of the
population.  Merely  believing that, or saying that out loud, doesn't make
him non-libertarian, does it?  In fact, he is objecting to the way the
government itself has initiated force, threatening people into paying
"taxes", and them disbursing those taxes in order to obtain political
advantage.  (votes.)   If anything, his making this argument would make him
a consistent libertarian.
Now, you may object to libertarians for precisely this reason:  You may
believe that it's okey-dokey for government to threaten people to pay
"taxes", so the government can use that money for political-benefit
reasons.  But taking that position merely identifies you as being

What he showed is that it works VERY poorly when those in scientific

time it "works" but the lengths of these "erroneous consensus" epochs can
stretch to lifetimes and during these periods the public can be denied the
advantages of the later "proven" science (for example, saving lives due to
effective medical treatments) or forced to pay (for example, through
unwarranted taxation, misguided public policies and regulations).
The crux of Crichton's arguments are that all too often Consensus is
presented publicly as Settled Science instead of what is really is:
politics. This is especially troubling when dealing with areas of science
(e.g., climatology) in which the application of the Scientific Method (not

What I meant,  if you are holding and sharing an entire file of some really
sensitive content and depend on networking technologies known or assumed to
have flaws which can expose your IP address you have relinquished ability
to deny it.
Whereas is this content has been published, using something like Freenet,
so no single user of the content distribution system has more than a
fragment of that content and what they each have is not only encrypted (and
you don't have the key) but its bit interleaved and your software has no
idea what part(s) of the content you hold nor where those other parts
reside (for that your software must possess the file's "treasure map" which
can be closely held). This offers good plausible deniability.
Warrant Canary creator
If it's encrypted and anonymous it's deniable by all, and even billed
for "filesharing" is fine, at least currently, due to legal free speech
uses riding within. Though if you bill it for "illegal copyright
you yourself might take heat for "incitement", but the network itself would
still be safe. Such network nodes themselves, like I2P / Tor / Freenet,
operate freely because of that principle, and it's been proven out
successfully so far for maybe 15-20 years. Strongly encrypted + strongly
anonymous + decentralized works in this space. Unfortunately, few qualify...
Napster, gnutella, limewire, kazaa, bittorrent, whatever... when run over

of centralized, not encrypted, not anonymous.... no deniability there.

Now I think you're describing Freenet.  How doth Freenet suck, let me
count the ways... massive computational overhead was the main thing,
last time I tried it which was ages ago.  It really needed its own
dedicated box to "just work."  But it does distribute files, increase
the availability of more popular ones (via increased redundancy of
storage), and is censorship resistant due to distributed storage of data
which itself is encrypted and anonymized.
I think a project that aims to improve on the implementation of the
basic ideas in Freenet could be a big winner.
Mojo was being developed contemporanously with Freenet and shares some of
its distributed features. It was sort of like Freenet + a resource based
currency. You do not want a filesharing system as it removes any hope of
plausible deniability for content.

Rewards seem nice, yet not everyone who wants to play
can pay, or the math overhead is crushing, or it becomes
centralized. Definitely worth trying, especially if it fits some
usage model.
Another form is to just let the network use whatever
CPU, RAM, DISK, NET that you're not currently
using, or give it whatever limits you want. In short,
set it and forget it. Let the network figure out how
to best use your node to support the network.
Maybe it's a strictly filesharing network,
or a general purpose network.
That's on the "Hey I just want to donate
this because it's cool like Seti etc.
Mojo's internal currency was based on the resources offered, shared or
consumed. We even patented it (apparently unknown to MaidSafe; hell they
never even heard about us :)
Users actual use of the network would
be through different apps... be it submitting
infohashes, or compute jobs, etc.
Does eliminating all the reward tracking overhead
provide substantial resources back to support
free use.
Probably not.
ie: Most people and their computer resources sit idle,
probably more than enough to provide back whatever
multimedia they want to consume.
If true, all balances out, no need to bother track accounting
with "pay to play" style system?
I like "pay to play" as it offers at least some
firm guarantee to the consumer offeror.
But an accounting free system is more fun as in free beer :)
Hybrids might work too.
100M users donating 10GiB slack space is about 0.93 EiB

Example, at 4x redundancy, that probably easily covers

The reason citizens are exposed to these dangers is that the people who
decide to go to war, remove heads of state, etc. are not exposed to the
same dangers. Citizens should insist, even at the risk of insurrection,
that politicians and their immrdiate families cannot have any special

I would not be so sure.  In the case of weapons earmarked for U.S. use,
I would bet heavily that there are no (deliberately installed) back
doors in their C&C systems:    Our military leaders may be passionately
ignorant and profoundly neurotic, that they are not actually stupid.
Lockout functions that take significant time and effort to defeat (when
enabled) I take for granted, even though for decades the unlock code for
all U.S. nuclear warhead firing circuits was a string of zeros.
In the case of weapons eligible for export, I would only be a /little/
less confident that back doors are not included:  One wants one's
allies' weapons to work as advertised, and the blowback from discovered
back doors would be very costly.
As is done with proprietary trade secret operating systems etc., these
back doors would be called "bugs" or "design flaws" when discovered, and
this hard to disprove canard would be widely accepted as fact.  But when
(not if) back doors weapons systems are discovered, that would be Bad

And now some politics...
*Here is why Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Is The Real Bitcoin*
*It is the original bitcoin*
It was hijacked from Gavin Andresen very surreptitiously by Adam Back (back
in the day, Adam and I worked on hashcash and digital cash-related
projects) with his Sidechain
proposal. It was a "Trojan Horse" and together with the help of
Blockstream, Theymos and the Core developers the process was completed. We,
the original community, have finally regained control of the Bitcoin
project, except that we have lost control of the name. This position is
about to be redressed.
*It does not have Segwit.*
If you look at a Bitcoin file as AD. A being the address and D being the
data, Segwit removes the address portion A, It is reduced to a hash and the
original signature is discarded after it is verified. So if your
"fingerprint" is the hash of all your signatures, the signatures are
discarded after being checked, and only the "fingerprint" is kept. This is
in effect what Segwit does.
The signatures are stored on another chain, but not the main chain. Some
nodes will keep signatures, some only keep partial records, some will
discard them entirely. If you ever need to refer back to the transaction to
check on the signatures all you have is the hash. "The fingerprint".
Satoshi's original design of bitcoin being an unbroken record of signatures
is violated.
*It allows for unlimited on-chain scaling*.
A clear example of the disastrous effect of limiting the blocksize is the
state of BTC now. The mempool is huge and getting bigger, fees are "over
the top". Their intention is to push low fee transactions to side chains
and the lightning network. These solutions don't exist yet.
The Core developers bought themselves over 2 years delaying and obfuscating
on chain scaling, and yet have no working solutions. Meanwhile the user
experience gets so bad that many users have sought other alternatives to
transact. BCH in the meantime have mined an 8MB block
*It has more client implementations*
BCH will have Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin ABC
and more. Each with their own development team but all operating on the
same chain. This diversity increases security, innovation and development
of the whole ecosystem.

They may be separate but they are not unrelated. There is only so much
mining power and its distribution affects both (actually all) chains.
Speaking of which BCC has reach the price (0.153 BTC), calculated on reddit
by Jonathan Vaage, at which mining on BCC (including all costs and rewards)
is better. This has become a rallying and resistance level and the battle
has been joined between these armies of miners, traders, whales, etc.
The next scheduled (not 20% emergency) difficulty adjustment comes in just
a few days for BCC (could be this weekend). After that, BTC also adjusts in
a few days. If a flippening is in the offing I think it would come shortly
after the BTC adjustment. If the miners in a major cartel then flee to BCC,
it will leave BTC bereft of hash power and block intervals could explode
preventing any practical use of the blockchain (a Chain Death Spiral). If
so, Core supporters will probably be forced into using similar "emergency"
difficult adjustments (even though they tried to humiliate Cash advocates
about this methodology before the fork).

Right, as long as you either exported your Bitcoin to your own wallet or
your Bitcoin was deposited in an exchange that assured its customers that
they would not claim the BCC themselves but hold it for users, then you are
fine. If, OTOH, your Bitcoin was deposited in an exchange that alerted its
users to withdraw their Bitcoin to their own wallets of they wanted it, and
you did not withdraw in before the fork then you are probably SoL.

[Disclosure: I am a strong supporter of L1 (Blockchain scaling) occurring
before any L2 (e.g., Segwit, Blockstream, Lightening Network, etc.) is
attempted. And even then all L2 must be thoroughly examined not only for
technical flaws but for possible misuses that affects the value and utility
of the underlying blockchain assets.]
Due to the economic and technical nature of Bitcoin and its blockchain its
more than possible that the new fork, widely being called Bitcoin Cash, BCH
or BCC, will overtake its rival fork now commonly called Bitcoin Core. The
effect of this "flippening" could be nothing short of disastrous for those
holding Bitcoin Core.
Since the recent Bitcoin hard fork we now have two Bitcoins: Core (the
original) and Cash. When the fork happened those holding BTC (in their own
wallets) were also able to claim an equal amount of BCC (for free). This
created a huge supply of BCC. However, many or most people rarely keep
their BTC in their wallets, preferring instead to keep them in online
exchange accounts. As a result, even though the exchanges warned people
they needed to withdraw their BTC to claim the BCC, most of those people
will never get that BCC. Instead it became a windfall for the exchanges.
When the fork occurred the Cash chain inherited the then current difficulty
factor of the original. When operating nominally both chains should have
new blocks discovered by miners about every 10 minutes. Because at the
outset the mining effort for Cash was only a small fraction of the Core's.
the rate new blocks were found (and therefore the transaction capacity)
initially was hobbled. This was anticipated and the developers included a
means to detect when the hashing power on this Cash chain was too low and
to quickly adjust, in 20% increments, the difficulty factor.
By far the main driver for miners is revenue. In general they will go to
whatever blockchain they earn the most. Analysis of the hash power being
expended on both chains versus the difficulties and value of each coin
showed that the two were converging insofar as mining profitability. There
is also an anomalous aspect to the sources of the BCC mining power. Unlike
that of BTC, where most of the hashing power is associated with known large
mining cartels, the majority of BCC mining is by unknown parties.There has
been significant variation of mining power over relatively short intervals
on both blockchains. The timing of this variation very much indicates that
the miners were attempting to beneficially manipulate both the value of BCC
vs. BTC and quickly decrease the mining effort for BCC.

As crazy as it sounds, for at least prototyping and small (CPunk) PoC
projects, its possible to fab a wide variety of chips, with impressive
feature sizes, implantation, doping, etc. using Electron Beam Lithography.
EBL is basically operating an electron microscope in reverse. Because it
uses electrons to illuminate the substrate vs. photons it doesn't require
any litho masks. The beams can directly write to the surfaces and with the
appropriate techniques expose chemicals that create the "resists" of
typical litho methods. Best of all, electron beams can be brought to a
sharper focus than even deep UV meaning small feature size capabilities.
The main reason EBL is only a tech oddity is its inability to be used for
volume manufacture. Maybe someone in this field will do an ICO. EBL can
potentially be operated by a much smaller staff (maybe a competent enough
individual) than even the smallest conventional fab. With at least small
scale manufacture and some careful design attention I think the list price

An open Ultra-Wide-Band transceiver chip set could not only enable
excellent covert comms. but also, when several transmitters using them are

I am using the term "UWB" broadly and not the more restrictive regulatory

bandwidth is miniscule and the process gain (PG) substantial compared with

OK, spread 'em!
As discussed, a key to effective covert wireless is conditioning
transmissions to appear arbitrary close to noise in channels before and
after your emissions. This invariably means keeping the spectral energy as
low as practical. Additional benefits accrue if the coding and occupied
spectrum change frequently (e.g., by frequency hopping and / or bandwidth
hopping). With proper protocol design many other covert parties can
simultaneously share the same relative spectral space (and minimized
interference) with their individually specific coding, based on shared
secret keys, creating a dynamic Uncoordinated Multiple Access (UMA).
All receivers have noise floors below which received signals are hidden
under the equipment's detection threshold. In order to patrol the huge,
assumed, DC to Daylight, spectrum Eve uses a variety of gear each type with
tradeoffs of spectrum coverage, scanning speed speed, noise floor and
dynamic range. These tradeoffs appear to be baked into the physics of
receiver tech, similar to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.
Because Alice and Bob are using tradecraft, protocols, HW and SW designed
to focus on Eve's limitations the advantage can shift sufficiently to
provide them an operational "umbrella".

@_subject: Re: Low speed, p2p, wireless as a secure alternative to SMS and Signal-like services. 
MF - HF spectrum
Long distance, non-LoS, communications are possible using various
ionospheric reflection techniques. Two of the most prominent means are skip
and NVIS (Near Vertical Incident Skywave).
With skip low elevation signals are reflected one or more times from the
transmission point to various layers of the ionosphere and back to earth.
The name skip is taken from the large geographic areas beneath the
reflections which are skipped and receive little or no signals. This
propagation mode is widely used for shortwave broadcasts, amateur radio and
government communications. Though it suffers from limited
temporal-frequency coherence / fading until the advent of satellite
communications it was the workhorse for all longer distance wireless.
Recently, there has  been a resurgence of, mostly government, research of
using this spectrum with wideband and multiple antenna techniques to
mitigate propagation limitations.
NVIS, invented by the Germans in WW II, uses different frequencies than
skip and high elevation angle transmissions to take advantage of other
ionospheric layers and reflect signals closer to the transmission point.
Effective communication is limited to 500 km or so. It's been very useful
for non-LoS in military theaters.
Most use and almost all research in these bands has focused on narrow
(generally below 4 kHz) voice and and very narrow band (digital)
communications. However, the favorable results from wider band (for example
Mitre corp.) research indicates low data rate SS techniques are practical
if not legal for other than governments. Recent R&D grants indicate
militaries are again looking to this spectrum as backup to possible
satellite outages during conflicts.

Unlike encryption, which is generally practiced at intermediate wireless
communication protocol layers, implementing covert features  requires
fundamental new tech at the PHY. In commercial stacks the PHY is invariably
implemented in hardware so a prototype (or a limited production) device
using this new tech requires the use of either a FPGA or software
implemented on a GPP. For prototyping on GPPs Matlab or Gnu Radio.
For pure wireless communications I prefer either Point-to-Point (PTP) or
single hop satellite links.
Satellites, especially geosynchronous, have advantages in channel quality
and bandwidth (often 100s of contiguous MHz spread across several
transponders). However, they generally require a good directional antenna
(to compensate for high path losses) and raise issues of being located by
multi-satellite Time-of-Arrival (ToA) or ground based surveillance methods.
Non-geosynchronous birds have individually limited ground visibility,
require somewhat complex doppler shift compensation, expensive and complex
tracking antenna mounts.
ToA can be mitigated by proper tradecraft or by nearfield antenna
techniques, sometimes employed in avionics to prevent ground based
detection of aircraft missile targeting signals.
The great advantage of satellites are their coverage area, high link
quality and that most still use "bent pipe" relay architectures. Although
recent implementations now use techniques (e.g., FFT and IFT) to clean
uplink signals before retransmission they are limited to notching out
frequencies and cannot be applied to offending broadband signals,
especially of the type under consideration.

In the academic sphere the favored, publicly released, applications of
these technologies has been to improve spectrum utilization and jamming
resistance. However, these same technologies can also confir covertness.
While encryption can protect the content of communication covertness can
deny an eavesdropper the more important metadata of who is talking with
whom and when.
It is well known that early Spread Spectrum (SS) methods (both frequency
hopping, FHSS, and direct sequence, DSSS) were initially created for
military purposes though are now part of wireless industry standards. There
are other SS techniques, like chirp, chaotic and UWB, which have yet to
find broad use in commercial or consumer products. There are yet other SS
methods which are still either experimental or used only in military /
government applications. Sometimes these approaches can be combined to
significantly increase effectiveness.
There is a general acknowledgement of relationships, in wired
communications, between certain characteristics (e.g., latency) privacy and
security. The same generally holds true for wireless. In addition,
wireless links must often deal with varying and unpredictable channel
Conversely, non-compliant wireless links (the only types of interest here)
can dynamically choose whatever spectrum fits within the hardware and
software capabilities and best suits the conversation at hand. It is also
free of service provider restrictions and costs.
One prominent way for wireless communications to acquire the covert
characteristics needed is by effectively masquerading as noise. This noise
can be from natural sources (e.g., lightning), non-communication radio
emissions (e.g., discharge type street lamps), unintentional communication
emissions or an uncontrolled mixture.
SIGINT analyst Eve may use a variety of specialized spectrum analysis tools
including Bragg Cell, electroptical, steering receivers to quickly scan
wide swaths of spectrum for signals of interests which can then be
investigated using narrower band devices. These devices can be terrestrial
or mounted on satellites.
All receivers have design tradeoffs mostly due to frequency coverage,
instantaneous bandwidth, noise figures, etc. Automated identification and
classification of unknown signals is an advancing art but still an inexact
science. If Alice and Bob use weak (very low spectral density),
intermittent, signals with very close similarity to noise they are,
individually, problematic for Eve. As the number of simultaneous, unrelated
and uncoordinated, parties share the spectrum the difficulty for Eve is
magnified even if she records the spectrum and attempts non-realtime
analysis. Despite massive SIGINT investments she is at disadvantage but the
intel agency narratives would have others believe they are all-seeing
With proper covert tech the advantage can shift asymmetrically in favor of
Alice and Bob. The situation has similarities to mixing of blockchain
transactions. It's also similar to the challenge faced by parties defending
their online servers from hackers. The defenders must block any intrusions
the attackers must only find one good exploit to win.

By choosing a different physical transport means a different and, I

commercial gateways, I propose using infrastructure-less or
non-permissioned commercial, single-hop, relays. It's not the
electromagnetic spectrum isn't also monitored but that the efficacy of that
monitoring is, unlike the former environment, much more limited by physics,
channel conditions, information theory and the proper application of
tradecraft by possible targets.
Both as a hobbyist and professional I've delved into the practicality of
utilizing and building on commonly available, even consumer grade, Software
Defined Signal Processing  (SDSP, the use of the term SDR is verboten in my

software. My investigations (some openly shared at Cypherpunk-oriented tech
conferences) have led me to believe that even a moderate uptake of these
SDSP technologies would effectively neutralize most or all SIGINT against
parties who aren't already the subject of individual targeting.
These technologies aren't some magical new creation but rather the
integration and adoption of ideas already well studied and reported in
academia but whose implementations are often not openly available for
tailoring and testing, mostly due to unfounded fears of regulatory actions.

Perhaps the only simple fix is to expand access to enable private
prosecutions so the rich and politically powerful, government employees
(especially in intelligence and law enforcement) can be equally targeted.

In the early-1970s, while working for TRW Data Systems (founded by Larry
and Doug Michaels, who later founded the early commercial Unix provider
Santa Cruz Operations) I led development of a proprietary OS for the
Datapoint 2200.
The OS ran on a descrete implementation of the 8008 processor after Intel
had encountered tech and yield issues. The OS supported drivers for
keyboard, CRT, disk and tape drives, telecommunications controlling dozens
of specialized remote terminals, and a hashed access database, With dynamic
overlays it all fit within 16 KB of RAM.

In the 1960s, while still in HS I wrote a short story (everything was still
paper then and unfortunately no longer have a copy) about a guy who uses a
quantum teleportation service to take a holiday on the planet of a nearby
star. Rather than moving his body the process only copied his mind into a
synth at the destination. His body on earth was placed in stasis. After his
holiday his updated mind was copied back to his Earth body.

Many of the problems of police enforcement, especially unwarranted
violence, cannot be solved until the human officers are replaced by
androids. The almost universal reason for excessive violence are unfit
officers and the officer's fear of injury or death. When this is no longer
a factor there is no longer a reason for this violence.

There is at least one other antenna technology useful for aiming RF
transmissions: NFDAM (Near Field Direct Antenna Modulation). Typically, a
continuous carrier is sent to the antenna and there a digital signal is
used to select an element from a 1 or 2 dimensional feed array that
modulates the far field direction of the signal with the intended data.
When properly applied only the signal in the desired direction (to the
intended receiver) can be reconstructed (or even detected).
