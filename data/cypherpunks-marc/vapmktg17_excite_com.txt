Dear fellow marketer;
A few months back I joined a program and then...promptly forgot
about it. You may have done this yourself sometime...you intend
to work the program but then get caught in your day-to-day
activities and it's soon forgotten.
The program was free to join so maybe I just didn't take it very
Anyway, near the end of September I received a letter from my
sponsor (Neil Gallagher) informing me that I had more than 1200 PAID members in my downline!
As you can imagine, I was very skeptical. After all, how could I
have more than 1200 paid members under me in a program that I had
never promoted?
I took the time to check out the site...then wrote to Neil asking
for confirmation that these were paid members and not just free
sign-ups...like me :)
Well, it was true...I had 1285 paid members in my downline. This
in a program that I had never worked!
All I had to do was upgrade to a paid membership before the end
of the month and I would have my position locked in and a
downline of 1285 people.
You can bet I wasted no time in getting my membership upgraded!
I can tell you, if I had known what was happening with this
program, I would have become an active paid member months ago!
With this program, you will get a HUGE downline of PAID MEMBERS .
My sponsor's, sponsor's check, which is a minimum of $5,000, arrives every month...on time. My sponsor himself gets almost 2K per month, and that only working the progam hard for 6 months.
