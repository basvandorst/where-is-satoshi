I agree the more people communicating the better.  I was just
commenting on what my own, and suspect many others on the list's
capabilities are.  While I would love to have access to a satellite
type of data service as a backup link its simply not in my budget and
even if it was I suspect any service available via satellite might
suffer from similar problems if the methods used to disrupt
connectivity in Egypt were employed here.

I agree that setting up "local" connectivity between the folks in my
neighborhood wouldn't be too much of a challenge.  Getting anything
much beyond that up and running would be a stretch.
