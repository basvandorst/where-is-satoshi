Due to the instability in the Middle East, lingering concerns about winter fuel supplies in the United States, operational snags in the Gulf of Mexico and labor strife in petroleum-rich Nigeria, oil prices held above $53 a barrel Friday. The United States is so dependent on foreign oil, we believe any new oil reserves found in America will help the country be more independent and increase both bottom and top line numbers particularly for many smaller based U.S. oil companies. One such company we feel could benefit significantly from the catalysts discussed above is Eagle Environmental Technologies trading under the ticker symbol "EGVR". For more information on this company please click on the link below and keep your eyes on any future news releases issued by the company.
