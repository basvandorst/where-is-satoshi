You may be able to escape the *criminal* clutches of this law.
But you might still be sued under 17 USC 1203, which provides for
seriously frightening statutory damages (as well as actual damages).

And, of course, the very act of putting in the check could cause a compiler
to not optimize out the zeroize code.  (Writing a proper test program for
such behavior is very difficult).
Like most programming language discussions, it's hard to tell whether the
arguments support writing critical code languages that abstract at a
higher level or a lower level.
