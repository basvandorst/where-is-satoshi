                                      memory. (the expression "fees are acc=
umulating" refer to this)
(but they dont accumulate in your wallet at this stage, they stay in the me=
mpool (like a temporary place))
 I get the benefit of my txn commissions <- this sounds absurd to me
In Bitcoin all the accumulated fees go straight to the miner who won the Po=
W (they go to an account controlled by the wallet of the miner).
In usps these profits are used to
"pay public services", and the remainder
is spread across all nodes (all nodes have an account, all these node accou=
nts see their balance increase)
Now if "public services cost is defined 0 (like it is just now)" then it me=
ans that all profit collected by transaction fees go straight to nodes (as =
a subsidy for maintaining the node. It could be called universal salary, de=
pending on the value amount.
So it is a more complex problem to exactly define how to spend this money (=
the money for public services), but the important thing is that we have a s=
ource of money that cannot be censored or hidden, that can be pipelined to =
fill different budgets that nobody can alter individually (although there m=
ust exist a way to set it up and modify it (I suggest a new work e-politics=
?)), and a way to redistribute remaining profits collected by transactions =
in a fair way. In a way that can be seen as in "I run anode that works for =
the system and it gets paid for it".
The cool thing of this automation is that this is 'public money' and the wa=
y it is spent is public, so there is no place for corruption.
Since a  wallet is just a file with private keys
they come with programs able to sign transactions
wallets don't enter into account in the public system, they belong to the '=
private system' and they reside in user computers, rather than node compute=
rs. (in usps the node runs both systems in the same computer, but this is f=
or convenience, they are logically separated systems)
I haven't introduced where are taxes taken into account yet, because in my =
previous explanation of how usps works I assumed that
the cost of public services is lower than the profit made by transactions. =
So not only the system has money to pay them, but the remainder
is used to afford a universal salary.
In a more dramatic case, which is closer to the case we live every day, pro=
fits of transactions are not enough to pay public services.
(this happens because in our world banks and private institutions profit pr=
ivately from money transfers).
So in order to be able to pay public services, participants must pay extra =
(taxes) and forget about having universal salary.
This is also coded in usps, all account would be altered and reduced in eno=
ugh quantity to be able to feed the public system pipeline.
 a structure of public budgets which are defined via [to be discussed furth=
er (dont want to mess the simplicity of this loop)]
Let me try to it in math with a simplified ledger of accounts with their ba=
 account1 1000   <-node account (where a node is paid for validation work)
 account2 1000   <-node account
 account3 1000   <-account
 account4 1000   <-account to pay roads
 account5 1000   <-account to pay health
public system: takes 10 for roads and 20 for health
Minute 1:
profit from transactions: 100
profit after paying public services: 70
profit spread -> 2 nodes -> 70/2=3D35 per node;
 account1 1035   <-node account (where a node is paid for validation work)
 account2 1035   <-node account
 account3 1000   <-account
 account4 1010   <-account to pay roads
 account5 1020   <-account to pay health
Minute 2:
profit from transactions: 50
50<70 profit not enough to pay public services.
taxes: 20 (takes 4 from each account)  (this a simplification for illustrat=
ing, the real algorithm takes from each account proportional to the balance=
 account1 1031   <-node account (where a node is paid for validation work)
 account2 1031   <-node account
 account3 1996   <-account
 account4 1016   <-account to pay roads
 account5 1036   <-account to pay health
This represents fairly well how every cycle of consensus work in usps. (wit=
h some intentional imprecisions in aras of clarity)
Thanks Zen for asking very good questions.
My argumentation goes as my thoughts are for using cryptoeconomy to solve a=
 public system that could compete with traditional governments. It will be =
the choice of the people to choose the better system.

I see a 'machine' able to remove gov-in-the-middle.
My personal challenge is to design such a machine, hopefully in agreement w=
ith this honorable list
ical alternatives.
A transition of where the truth is. From govs made of some humans who conce=
ntrate the power, to a distributed mostly automated gov where humans retain=
 their power.
The top level main loop can be: (executed every consensus cycle (1 minute))
1.- all accounts are seen by the consensus public algorithm, who is in char=
ge of modifying balances upon cryptographical evidence (transactions).
2.- Fees are accumulating as tx are being settled.
3.- Accumulated Fees are used to pay public services. They are fed into a s=
tructure of public budgets which are defined via [to be discussed further (=
dont want to mess the simplicity of this loop)]
If not enough money is available to pay public services then
the money is taken from the accounts (taxing).
4.- Remainder are distributed across nodes.
5.- go to 1.
The big complexity comes in step 3, or how to distribute profits to pay pub=
lic service, or the bourocratic pipeline (sorry for the horrific word).
This is something to discuss, I have some ideas but my development stage fo=
r this 3rd step is 0.
My system under test just spread all the collected profit across nodes, ski=
pping step 3.
Please excuse me for using words like tax or budgets, we can invent other w=
ords for these conceps to not get confused by using real-world words that a=

According to a rough calculus, if fees taken from transactions can run comp=

 mass consumption financial services, fees would be enough to pay a good pu=
blic system, which means that taxes are perhaps not required or if they are=
 they would be much less than today's taxes.
I'd love to have the time investigate more on how cheaper a public system c=
ould be compared to current ones.
I am not a good fan of leadership, because it represents a centralization a=

Privacy and anonymity are key in my design. (I intentionally left IPv4 disc=
losure apart (I acknowledge it is a leak) because I plan to solve the issue=
 as a patch in the Tor network).
That's another this I'd like to discuss.
If in the Tor network the entry/guard nodes (who are witnesses of your IP4 =
address) could forward a hashed version of the IP4, I would solve the sybil=

arianism and to anarchy, which I am akin with.
You're confused with my use of the word taxation, which for you it might so=
rt of tabu, but for me is something that deserves to be discussed more in a=
 way of how bad current Govs are collecting them paying common services, an=
d how new approaches could work respecting privacy and anonymity.
Anyway this is only one of the features that can improve the status quo of =
the society, which compared to the main one, the electronic cash system wit=
h renewed tech, which I also try to write about, is perhaps the most intere=
sting one.
I am not lazy, I work hard, I surface little.
It is not a taxation system, this is a misunderstanding.
It was a remake of bitcoin at the beginning which turned to be quite differ=
ent at the end.
Anyone who values anonymity, privacy, technology, there is no exclusion.
In general this post is ackward. Saying I lack of basic knowledge is a bit =
rude for someone who said forefront that has spent 3 years working on the d=
evelopment of system.
I don't have a clue of why you would say I want to learn the basics from yo=
u. In fact I'm always opening to learning on top of me having pretty good k=
nowledge and training on all topics surrounding cryptocurrency and hi-tech.
I also empathize with the culture of this list.
I apologize if my wording confused you about my background.
Thanks for taking your time to answer.

So this crypto was ideated from the beginning to automate the pipeline

So all accounts experiment a decay on gas (the crypto that powers the publi=

There is a reason for using IP4, see below.

I am not enforcing licences. Think microsoft, they dont pursue home piracy,=

This is anonymous system as far as underlying tech allows (IP4 transport).
Information travels encrypted end2end, aka node2node
My algorithm just enforces there are no more than 6 nodes per IP4.

t. what this USPS proposes is a bottom-up approach to a Public System, star=
ting from the fundamentals.
The proposal is to replace current Governments with a low-cost distributed =
machine that would collect inputs and produce outputs in infinite loop. A s=
ystem that would have a real view of the 'common interest' because it would=
 not apply filters in people's input.
The system would be able to let people decide whether if a 'road' is conven=
ient or not, and how to fund it.
Everything is better compared to our current model of participation in the =
society based on ticking a box every 4 or 5 years.

I like to have a single point of failure. (even though I've worked for doin=

The difference that in aeronatics the system is composed of trusted subsyst=

In an untrusted system you can only rely on your node and on the ledger.
The single point of failure is transaction validation. If you break this, t=

Once a tx is validated its payload enters the ledger modifying it.
The software running in the node comes from the ledger itself.
In USPS the software is published by what I call the Other Foundation. An a=

if you execute in your node this command:

  B) without PoS, or any other Po* I've considered during my design (e.g. b=

Additionally, all criticism towards USPS related to anonymity goes to a pro=
per overlay layer compatible with such rule.
Tor is not valid because is unable to apply the limiting rule.

That's USPS mechanism:
state+diff=3Dnext state
The unbloated trait is present as well. There is no history to carry on wit=
h it acting like an elastic gum (time to sync a new node for instance).
The verification taking place to calculate the next state
is enough to trust on the state. There is no need to
validate the history from the genesis to trust the last state.
The truth starts there, on the last block.

 set, where an utxo is a Bitcoin word, I call it boxes because files or typ=
ed information can be also stored in every account. Nodes also run a wallet=
 with P2P protocols to trade among them in what I call the pricate system. =
Both system (the public, the private) form a closed ecosystem designed to m=

That's an overview and a final note on the vision.

My take on Monero is that it is an overengineered solution.
Mu understanding of an anonymous public system includes:

lic database.
*I shouldn't be able to link anything to a particular person or group.
Monero fails the first one, bcs they focused on making it difficult to anal=

that are of public interest. they instead made an opaque public system.
The privacy problem coming from having the flow in clear is obvious. Behavi=

The solutionm in my view, is not overloading the network, but instead by us=
ing a flow-break mechanism (like a mixer), which forms part of the public s=

The monero's trick is probably limiting its scalability as well.

e matching all the stuff you say about desirable coins (with the exception =

s' is handled by voting...based one IP address one vote. But how robust is =
relying on IP addresses at the end of the day?
IPv4 provides unique features no other protocol has. address space is satur=
ated (scarce) and addresses are not cheap. It is a a nice tool for Sybil co=
't mean it isn't trivial for anybody to keep a copy of all transactions. So=
, are you using techniques like, say, those used by monero to hide amounts =
and senders/receivers?
That's a good one.
tl;dr; planned feature.
Monero, AFAIK, makes it difficult not impossible to trace transactions.
So it adds some obfuscation. If validation nodes are open source at some po=
int in the code they have to do the basic math. Other thing is that this ma=
th is done not by all nodes but only some of the nodes. That's the difficul=
ty for a listener node to catch all transactions.
In USPS, as long as the network is big, it makes harder -not impossible- to=
 reconstruct the state from recorded transactions because nodes handle only=
 a fraction of the traffic.
Still, addresses are anonymous, and nodes mix all of them as they arrive, m=
aking the equivalent of a big tx with many inputs-many outputs
on every consensus cycle.
Still yes, individual tx can be recorded as they arrive with a trivial patc=
h. This would allow to follow the money across anonymous accounts. And this=
 could lead to potential associations with separate events (e.g. I buy some=
thing and then I buy other thing; an observer could find a parallelism usin=
g time and sequence to narrow or find out  addresses belonging to me).
I have ideas to tackle these cases which are very real theoretically, altho=
ugh only for a minority of people would result of some real concern (to me =
is a concern))
To be added in the future, as the concern grows bigger, a mixer implemented=
 as a public algorithm (my name for ~smart contract). With this feature one=
 could use it anytime they can break the potential traceability of their mo=
ney moves, which is already difficult if the network is big.
Privacy to me falls more on the ability to do real P2P end2end (real end2en=
d) encrypted trades between 2 nodes without awareness of the rest.
