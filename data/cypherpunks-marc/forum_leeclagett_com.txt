It has been possible to "prune" old transactions from a local copy of
the blockchain with Bitcoin Core for some time before Segwit was ever
merged. You cannot realistically force someone to store the entire
blockchain for you. The ability to prune old signatures while keeping
the core transaction is actually a benefit - every transaction is
necessary to verify that no double-spending has occurred or that miners
did not create more coins than allowed. So even if the entire network
dumped all segwit information, some critical checks of the system can
be done by newcomers (but only if at least one person stores the
entirety of the transaction information).

What did this have to do with my post? You seem to be addressing a
tangential part - yes pruning transaction information in your local
blockchain may cause information leakage - but my focus was refuting
the argument against separating the signatures from the transactions.
Bitcoin is not a cryptonote like design where the signatures are
intricately linked to double spending and the inflation schedule. So
the impact/negatives are in more of a "gray" area.
1. Privacy transactions are optional in ZCash, which reduces its
cloaking set. I am not sure about the Zcoin variant, but privacy
transactions are also unlikely to be mandatory due to the costs of
computing such transactions. And most likely Bitcoin would switch to
something closer to Dash than the ZeroCoin protocol (not that its
necessarily a better privacy option, just that its a smaller less risky
3. I do not see how this is desirable based on the information provided
in that Bitcoin 2.0 paper. The "winner" of the next block is still based
on hashing power and therefore this does not appear to be a solution
that prevents mining centralization. No reasonable person would select
a miner with low probability of mining the next block. I suppose if
magically nearly everyone agreed to ban one miner it could work, but
only until the miner generated another alias.

I did forget that using a sidechain means you still technically own
"Bitcoin". So the situation is a bit different than exchanging to
another coin. Although the primary point still stands - Blockstream can
try to influence Bitcoin heavily if they want, but it will simply push
more people to fork the project out of their control entirely.

Segwit was activated because it was a logical improvement to the
network in several areas. The primary objection I am aware of is how it
was implemented via soft fork. If enough participates are not enforcing
Segwit, then user funds could theoretically be stolen. The way this is
discussed on bitcoin.com in particular is confusing to the average
person. That problem exists with _every_ blockchain. If a majority of
the nodes are skipping signature checks due to the cost, you are still
in the stealing-user-funds doomsday scenario. The only complications
added by Segwit were: (1) how quickly do users upgrade nodes, and (2)
would it encourage more people to skip signature checks since it would
save on bandwidth (miners have been proven to do this previously due to
the CPU latency savings). AFAIK, its impossible to enforce nodes to
check signatures so (2) is only a problem if the majority of nodes are
constrained on bandwidth but not CPU, and (1) was mitigated by
releasing software nearly a year advance and watching the miners/nodes
for self reporting their version numbers. And even then, people could
simply never create a Segwit address if they were still concerned about
the potential security (i.e. its use is completely optional, and
sending or receiving money from a Segwit address in no way changes your
This does bring up an interesting point, what happens if the blocksize
is increased to the point where nodes become a little CPU bound? Do a
sizeable portion of the nodes begin to skip signature checks? Has the
security of the system decreased as a result of increasing the
Segwit is not forcing people off of the main chain - the limited block
space is forcing people off the main chain. Concerns of a sidechain
patent are also dubious. There are many ways for people to exchange
between crypto-currencies, including one decentralized p2p exchange
"bisq". The adoption of Bitcoin Cash by Coinbase and other parties
seems to indicate that Blockstream has no control over where the
transactions occur. People do not have to use "the main chain" for
settlement at all! This is the worst part of the Blockstream is ruining
Bitcoin narrative, if they push that hard people are just going to
fork to their own variant. I think it would even be possible to take
control of the Bitcoin name away from "core" if they were deemed that
untrustworthy (the Monero community did this with
My primary objection to this portion is this statement:
    allow for Bitcoin to scale according to the amount of users on the
    network, without the high-fee-based scalability model.
Increasing the blocksize allows more transactions in a block, but it
also increases the network/cpu/memory/storage costs to miners and full
node operators. Right now the costs are low enough where light=weight
based wallets can connect to a full node for free to retrieve the
necessary information. Raising the blocksize faster than the relative
costs of running a full node likely will result in node operators
requiring payment from light-weight type wallets to provide that
service. There is no "free lunch" here; either the costs of processing
on-chain transactions is so low that the light-weight wallet services
can be provided cheaply, or more revenue needs to be generated for those
nodes to offset the larger cost of processing the transactions. The
first test to see what happens in this regard might be Ethereum, as
running a node seems to have high costs already.
Also this statement:
    Censorship-resistant money.
was likely intended to be an objection to the higher transaction fees
that could be effectively pricing people out of the market. I suppose
this is a form of censorship, albeit in a way different than most think
about it. I think mining centralizing is a bigger concern - no amount
of money can technically offset a "banning" in the worst case. Perhaps
my scenario is less likely to happen? It seems like people can move to
another crypto-currency if either is that problematic.
Are you not shilling for Bitcoin Cash right now?
Why would banks win if Segwit adoption spreads? This is such an obvious
falsehood to anyone who understands the technology that the sentence
reads as complete incomprehensible garbage.
I cannot grok the phrase "making it expensive to mine at a loss when
hashpower is removed". If they removed the hashpower, what are they
mining? Anyway, the Bitcoin Cash algorithm was designed to react quicker
to a loss in hashrate. It can cause oscillation problems as miners
move between different networks due to changes in difficulty/price of
various coins with the same PoW. I don't see this as a positive or
negative for Bitcoin Cash, the programmers appeared to make a best
effort judgement call to keep the network going.
The banks planned for Bitcoin to die? Then why allow open-source code
that can easily be copied and forked to do what Bitcoin Cash is doing?
I realize that you are clearly shilling non-sense for Bitcoin Cash, but
the rhetoric was so over the top in this post I couldn't help but
respond to the stupidity.

PoW difficulty of the entire chain. It takes enormous resources to
produce an alternate chain dating back to the genesis block that is
anywhere close to the difficulty of the BTC chain.
A node has to download the entire blockchain contents to verify that
the UTXO set commitment is valid. You can require each miner to post
this commitment, then have it a part of the consensus protocol, but
that only tells you that your network peers didn't reject the UTXO
commitment and nothing of its validity.
The comment thread on /r/btc indicates that this is going to be used
for a fast sync mode. The security, if the entire chain isn't
downloaded, is equivalent to SPV but allows slightly more privacy.
However, if people frequently spin up a fast sync node only when they
want to transact, an ISP can easily log when they see bitcoin p2p
traffic and look at the transactions in that given time window. This is
an extreme case (for some), and is probably an improvement over the
pure SPV methods which can leak information directly to the node
providing the SPV client information.

I mentioned Zcash because it was not mentioned when I thought it should.
The opt-in privacy is the biggest drawback - it creates tracking
opportunities for unaware users of how the technology works. This also
reduces the privacy of other users.
There's also the newer math assumptions involved. The basic mathematical
assumptions (i.e. no proof) for Monero are hash-function behavior and
ECDLP hardness which are identical to Bitcoin. The ring-signature _may_
have an additional small assumption, but iirc one of the math
researchers reduced this to being identical to aforementioned
assumptions. Whether this is a serious issue is debatable/subjective.
Taproot still leaks graph history and amounts. Ultimately this will help
with linking public lightning channels (via capacity) to on-chain
events. Taproot output swapping is also more difficult for this reason
- JoinMarket (last I looked) was attempting a new order-book type to
mitigate the public amounts on-chain. Using those order-types are going
to be pretty rough, I'm not convinced they can pull it off _and_ get a
decent amount of users.
I'm not sure what you mean here. I hope the lightning network works -
blockchain scaling is still a sore spot. I think the privacy from
lightning network should be less than what the parrots are claiming. The
actual privacy is likely to depend on the number of private (not
publicly advertised) lightning channels.

Invulnerable -> "impossible to harm or damage".
"Monaro is clearly invulnerable to the bitcoin problem" ... ? What does
that even mean in this context? You seem to be stating that Monaro has
solved bitcoin's problems?
You've provided=09no clear examples of data leakage, and assumed that
there no people=09within the Monero community researching=09such topics.
There are several in the  doing exactly what you
describe in various ways. Funding for this is somewhat low so its
difficult to have the major press releases and landing pages describing
it. There's been a few changes and possibly a few more based on analysis
from a people that "hang around" that IRC room. There's a few videos on
youtube for this topic as well.
I take exception with the phrasing "really hard", but certainly there is
more to think about with non-prime groups. However, framing this as a
mishap resulting from ignorant people that should've simply used a prime
order group is also incorrect. When the coin first launched, Ristretto
didn't exist and Ed25519 was an interesting choice for a curve on a new
coin. The original implementation also has no issues resulting from this
choice, but unfortunately a modification to the original design did. And
changing the curve of a production-used coin isn't trivial. Its easy for
outside critics to boast about things "they would've done" when they
aren't considering all of the details.
The attack cannot be sufficiently addressed with public amounts in the
transaction. The wallet user typically also has to be careful about
their usage patterns. The "opt-in" privacy is a primary issue.
This is ignoring my other point - if everyone used Wasabi the efficiency
gains touted by Bitcoin are reduced.
I'm not sure what you mean here.

or not, we need to learn the truth.
No actual critique here, some vague accusation of ivory tower
I'm going to assume that you are not god, and are in fact infallible.
Its worth mentioning that the original cryptonote authors were aware of
the twist issues (or blindly/luckily followed DJB's advice) as the
codebase has mul8 (the cofactor) in two key areas since the first
commit. These authors came up with an entirely new ring-signature
design - it was not as simple as "using academic literature" - the
technique requires one-time use stealth addresses. And the stealth
addresses _may_ have been the design of these same authors (its
ambiguous whether "ByteCoin" on bitcointalk is related to coin with the
same name).
The person who wrote the bulk of the ring-CT code (not associated with
the original cryptonote developers) was almost certainly aware of
cofactor issues. This person had to adapt the
"confidential-transactions" concept to work with Monero ring-signatures.
I doubt you can claim more competence than this person, if any. The
problem is some operations do not require a sub-group check or cofactor
multiply, and either mitigation strategy uses non-trivial number of CPU
The problem is no worse than Bitcoin - did you intend to promote Zcash
here? There's some negatives to that project that can be found via
websearch, but the z-address transactions are (assuming no bugs or math
errors) not leaking the information you describe.
Wasabi is not an improvement over Monero, there is far more information
leakage. I can't even think of a single privacy related benefit to
Wasabi over Monero transaction constructions off-hand. Every transaction
has a publicly visible amount, which aids in tracing "through" the
mixing process - outputs are frequently broken into fixed sized-amounts,
mixed, then re-assembled into nearly the same size as the original
output. Also, every output in a "mix" operation is **definitely** spent,
where in Monero an output in a ring-signature is _possibly_ spent. This
makes tracking a bit more challenging because an output can appear any
number of times as an input. The technique by Monero is also
non-interactive, so there isn't any IP related data leakage to a mixing
server. Every Monero transaction requires the ring-signature
construction, so they do not "stand out" like Wasabi transactions. If
this "flipped" to where Wasabi style is the norm, then Bitcoin
transaction volume is massively increased, narrowing (or passing) the
gap to the larger Monero transactions.
The code for auditing the supply still remains more simple, but I cannot
think of a single benefit to privacy.
