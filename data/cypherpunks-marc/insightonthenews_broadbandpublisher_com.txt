By: Angelo M. Codevilla
Our current war on terrorism is only the latest instance in which the CIA's ineptitude, incompetence, gullibility, prejudice, corruption and self-serving nature have made it a net detriment to U.S. national security. Hence, getting good intelligence must begin with the firing of most of the people now employed at CIA headquarters, starting with George Tenet. NO: Await findings of the Capitol Hill probe before condemning George Tenet.
By: Frederick P. Hitz
Congress is gearing up to examine how well the U.S. intelligence community performed prior to Sept. 11 regarding its core mission of warning the president and the American people about the most serious surprise attack since Pearl Harbor.

Bush and congressional leaders of the investigation rightly have said it must not be undertaken as a head-hunting expedition. ... POLITICS: Bringing Abducted Americans Home

Well, not really. That's because we had a double issue last week, which carries into this week. The good news is that our double issue won't affect "Daily Insight" one lick.  On a daily basis we will continue to mix breaking news and commentary from Insight writers.

Just a mid-week reminder that Daily Insight has some developing stories that you might want to check out.
Will White Resign? An army spokeswoman Wednesday night said a media report that Secretary of the Army Thomas E. White will resign his post over the next seven to 10 days is not true. With all the speculation that Iraq is still holding an American POW, there's some troubling news that Al Qaiada has one of ours:
Ex-spy chief: Al Qaida has U.S. prisoners Also, Insight's Mike Waller snaged an interview with a senior Uzbek official.  Here's what he found:

     Was the Emancipation Proclamation a political gimmick?
Most Americans consider Abraham Lincoln to be the greatest president in history.  What if, instead of an American hero who fought to free the slaves, Lincoln were in fact a calculating politician who waged the bloodiest war in American history to build an empire that rivaled Great Britain's?  In The Real Lincoln, Thomas DiLorenzo uncovers a side of Lincoln not told in many history books.  .

Just to let you know about a sneak preview from next week’s issue by Paul Rodriguez and Kelly O’Meara that we've posted early on-line:
"The Problem of Sexual Molestation by Roman Catholic Clergy" is how the report begins. It is a confidential document written nearly 17 years ago that lays out a detailed plan to steer the Roman Catholic Church away from troubled waters. The flood of allegations splashing across the news today strongly suggests that its leadership did not fully implement—if at all—such a plan and went to great lengths to cover up problems, quietly buy off victims and rotate pedophile and homosexual predator priests from parish to parish without telling the public.
And here’s the link for Kenneth Timmerman’s hot story on the Iraqi connection to the Oklahoma City bombing.  Our apologies, as we omitted the link in our last email.

Don't miss Kenneth Timmerman's Insight Exclusive on the Iraq connection to the Oklahoma City bombing. We just posted it, Friday morning.
Insight has learned that the widow of Philippine-government intelligence agent Edwin Angeles has provided audiotaped testimony to an investigator working for the American victims' families that directly ties Iraqi intelligence agents to Terry Nichols, the man sentenced in 1998 to life in prison for his role in bombing the Alfred P. Murrah Building seven years ago.
Elmina Abdul is the 27-year-old widow of Angeles, one of the cofounders of the Abu Sayyaf group, a Muslim separatist terrorist organization in the Philippines whose members trained in Osama bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan. Her astonishing story, revealed in this exclusive story for the first time, could blow the lid off what a growing number of people believe is a U.S. government cover-up of vital evidence in the Oklahoma City bombing case.

Sean Paige reveals that the Department of Energy has purchased thousands of alternative-fuel vehicles in recent years to appear as if it is at the vanguard of energy-conservation efforts. But the department has made little progress in cutting its overall gasoline consumption.

Folks, Steve Goode has struck a nerve with his report on censorship on campus. If you havent seen it yet, just go to  and see why. And Paul Gottfrieds contribution to the debate over the rise of the European Right is turning a lot of heads  . Thats it for today, from the Bunker, until next time I am your reporter in Washington.
GAY LOBBY SCRAMBLES TO HIDE THE TRUTH ABOUT MOLESTATION
It is convenient for sodomy advocates to blame a "culture of secrecy" on the molestation of hundreds of boys at the hands of homosexual priests, but the truth is obvious to any rational person: A man who molests a preteen or teen-age boy is engaging in homosexual behavior.
SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT THE RISE OF THE EUROPEAN RIGHT?
IVO H. DAALDER SAYS: YES: The anti-immigrant parties are racist, xenophobic and intolerant and could undermine the European Union.

Folks, we just finished a wild week here in Washington. Steve Goode has done it again with the story of two campus heroes of free speech. And Sam MacDonald will surprise you with the inside stuff on the expanding plans of independent parties (remember them from 2000?). Until next time, I remain your newsman from the ACT II FOR WOOLSEY AT THE CIA?
Jamie Dettmer tells us that James Woolsey's light in many ways has shone brighter since he left Langley. Now many lawmakers and Capitol Hill staffers intent on reform of the CIA have become convinced that he should return as intelligence director.
THE NEW THIRD PARTY THREAT
Sam MacDonald reports that candidates from the Libertarian and the Green parties collected enough votes in 2000 to shift the balance of national politics. This year, their eyes are on bigger prizes.
CENSORING CENSORSHIP ON CAMPUS

SYMPOSIUM---PRO & CON
Q: Has the White House ignored human rights in the name of national security? WILLIAM SCHULZ SAYS: YES: The administration has given itself and its coalition partners a 'pass' on human-rights violations.
ROBERT L. MAGINNIS SAYS: NO: It is not treating suspected terrorists inhumanely nor trampling on the civil rights of citizens.
America's global war on terrorism significantly will advance human rights because it will free people from repression and the threat of terrorism. Until the war is over, however, expect temporary sacrifices for more security. Every soldier facing the enemy understands this unavoidable trade-off.

Folks, last week we put out our Spring Double Issue, so you wont find a new issue today. But you will find some outstanding stories you may have missed. . . . Ralph de Toledanos blistering expose of the ACLU,  Jamie Dettmers remarkable story on damage control inside the FBI and CIA post Sept. 11,  and Doug Burtons Symposium on whether the NEA discriminates against its religious members  name just a few. Until next time, Im still your Newsman in Washington.
CIA AND FBI PLAY THE BLAME GAME
Jamie Dettmer reveals that the fabled Clinton "war room," with its alert media reflexes and craftiness in unleashing quick ripostes to potentially damaging stories, had nothing on these spooks and G-men!
DOLLARS AND SENSE
Sean Paige writes that having blundered once already with a Susan B. Anthony dollar coin that confused people by looking and feeling too much like a quarter, the folks in Washington seem to have produced yet another dollar coin that hasn't caught on with anyone other than coin collectors.
TAXPAYERS GETTING DRILLED ON FLORIDA LEASE DEAL
Sean Paige has discovered that environmental groups are purring like kittens (kittens that ate the canary) after the Bush administration agreed to a $235 million taxpayer buyback of gas and mineral leases on public lands in Florida, where the president's brother, Jeb Bush, just happens to be governor.
     Liberals & Homosexuals Conspire to Subvert Seminaries
Liberals who blame celibacy for the Catholic Church's pedophilia scandals are missing the real cause: seminaries that actively encourage homosexuality, moral laxity, and theological dissent all in the name of post-Vatican II "renewal."  In Goodbye, Good Men, Michael S. Rose demonstrates that such seminaries are by no means rare.  Help defend Christianity from assault by those who would subvert its message from within.

Janice Crouse and Wendy Wright tell us that on the surface, CEDAW looks advantageous to all women. What's not to like about a treaty that would supposedly "end discrimination against women"? If this was what CEDAW really was about, we all would applaud it. But it's not.
IS THE NEA FAIR TO ITS RELIGIOUS MEMBERS?
          BOB CHASE SAYS YES: The record shows that NEA treats all teachers  both union and nonunion  with respect.
Persecution? The form used by the Ohio Education Association to determine whether a religious objector has a legitimate case under the law is less probing, less intrusive and far shorter than the information the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation advises individuals to provide.
          STEFAN GLEASON SAYS NO: The NEA's primary goal is to impose its radical social agenda on public education.
In May, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission determined that the National Education Association systematically discriminates against teachers who have a religious objection to joining or supporting that teachers union. This confirmed once again that the nation's largest teachers union has a bias against people of faith who do not support its radical social agenda.
