I think what you really want is the ability within Google's interface to
specify how you'd like the certificate verified.  If the threat model they
are defending against is MiTM, then merely accepting the certificate
without prompting from you provides protection against passive
eavesdropping only, not active MiTM.  They've chosen to try and defend
against those who can tinker with packets, not just observe them.
You may disagree that this is the right threat to protect against (you
might be more worried about the NSA observing packets for example, rather
than tinkering with them) but given some of the more recent attacks against
Google (and Facebook's) customers they believe that active MiTM is actually
a real threat, and would rather not pretend to protect you from it when
they aren't, by using a self-signed certificate that they haven't verified
in any way, even by you presenting it.
The obvious solution is to either:
1. Not use TLS
2. Default to CA signed certificates
3. Support other protocols or means for you to identify what keys and/or
trust-anchors you trust.
Given that Google actually controls the client-code in this case, it might
actually a truly usable use-case for the newly minted CAA and TLSA (DANE)
specifications.  They can't be deployed most places (browsers) because of
last-mile DNS tinkering by all of the middleboxes on people's networks, but
that probably isn't the case where Google is connecting to your server,
using theirs.
Just a thought.
