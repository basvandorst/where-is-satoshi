Thom, consider;
a single page where people can drop requests, and where those requests are
a structure where people can contribute howto's, (possibly with a login)
many gaming sites use something alike, a shared pool of ideas for maps etc,
and another pool where the map makers show(case) there work and progress on
the project.
or, even nicer, make a single page listing all howto's, and give all
contributers there own page to put them on ( ).
That way you can create a single access page for the visitors, while at the
same time offer 'creative freedom' to some extend to the contributers (at
the cost of a uniform sitestyle :)  )
the forum won't do for this type of thing, even if you create a request
section, it won't be used. Forums are like answering machines --until they
gain critical mass-- 99% hangs up after the beep. And worse: being dynamic
pages the exposure to search engines will realy suck, making the content a
lot harder to find.
