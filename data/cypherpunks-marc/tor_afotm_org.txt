Hash: SHA512
i really think that this is a good thing, because i think this hidden
service will get a lot attention in countries where Facebook is
blocked. So it will get one of their goals to improve hidden service
scalability and performance which is good for all of us. I hope they
share their experience with operating this hidden service with us.
Also it is nice because i can tell the next time police is knocking at
my door that now even facebook is on Tor. And they know what facebook
is and i hope they will start to accept that tor is not build for
support terror (which still some of that people that i had to talk
with think).
Thanks Facebook, keep this project alive.
