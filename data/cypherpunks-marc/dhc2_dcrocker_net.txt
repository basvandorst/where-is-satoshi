Sorry, but I think the technical implications of a goal to survive 'hostile battlefield conditions' versus 'nuclear attack' are (small pun) massively different.  Hence I think the actual language used matters.
And the fact that the common language around the net during the '70s was the former and not the latter matters.  Which is why it would be helpful to get some credible documentation about use of the latter.
I'd expect the major difference in the two terms is the scale of the outage. A few square miles, versus possibly thousands.
To that end, I remember an anecdote about van Jacobson from the 1989 quake in California that might provide some insight about a large-scale outage:[1]
He was living in Berkeley but was visiting Stanford when the quake hit and he wanted to check that his girlfriend was safe.  Of course, the phone didn't work.[2]
Out of sheer frustration and the need to do /something/ he sent her an email.
He got a response within a few minutes.
Surprised that the net was still working (and working quite well), he did a traceroute from the Stanford system to the one his girlfriend was using.[3]
Not surprisingly, the path did not cross the San Francisco Bay, as it normally would have.  Instead it went down to Los Angeles, across the southern US, up the East Coast and back across the Northern U.S.
Although the outage was fairly small-scale, the scale of the re-routing suggests that a larger, 'regional' outage from something like a nuclear event would adapt readily.  (We can ignore the additional question of EMP effects, since that only affects the scale of the outage.)  And, of course, there have been other test cases since then...
[1] This is anecdotal; I've never confirmed the story with him.
[2] That does not automatically indicate a system failure, given the switch to an emergency mode for the phone system that restricts access during major events like these.
[3] Van created traceroute.

Maybe not quite an UL...
On the average, The Rand Corp is extremely careful about what it publishes, yet here it is, repeating the claim.
Back in the '70s, I always heard "survive hostile battlefield conditions" and never heard anyone talk about comms survival of a nuclear event, but I wasn't in any interesting conversations, such as in front of funding agencies...
