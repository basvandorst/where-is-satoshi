I could see a business around this: NSA-proof shipping company, using
Apple's model, put out an NSL notice each month:
   - For January, we have not received any Nation Security Letters this
   month.
   - On the month you receive one, you stop putting such notices out, and
   sell the now-useless business.
This doesn't stop the receiving country from inserting such devices, but
would help regain some trust overseas about NSA bugged devices that ship
from the USA.
