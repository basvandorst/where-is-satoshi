H-uman...G-rowth...H-ormone Therapy
"Overall deterioration of the body that comes with growing old is not inevitable."---Dr. Daniel Rudman's in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Follow me to longer living: Scientific research and evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that, in addition to genetic and environmental factors, our body's reduced production of H-uman...G-rowth...H-ormone is a direct cause of aging. Between the ages of 20 to 70, our levels can fall by more than 75%. This may cause us to look and feel older and less energetic. By the time most of us have reached our forties, we are already experiencing a H-uman...G-rowth...H-ormone deficiency.
