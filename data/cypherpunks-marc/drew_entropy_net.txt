Dearest Choate,
The title you're looking for is "Minority Report". The trailer seems good, and indicates potential despite the fact that it's a Spielberg movie starring Tom Cruise. It's yet another movie based on a Phillip K. Dick story, which means it will have little resemblance to the story at all.
