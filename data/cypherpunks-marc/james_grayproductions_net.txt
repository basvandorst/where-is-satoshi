Just to be clear, I was actually talking about reading *code*, not  books.  I think you learn a lot from figuring out how other  programmers solve problems, by breaking down their solutions.
Though books are valuable too, of course.  I also agree with others  that writing code is the key.

That's great advice.
I feel reading is a little under-valued and can be extremely helpful  to your growth as a programmer.  Check out the book Code Reading  sometime.  I sure learned a lot from it.

Obviously I am biased here, but are you aware of the Ruby Quiz[1]?   Problems there range from easy to fairly tough, so I recommend  shopping around for a problem that interests you.
Hope that helps.
