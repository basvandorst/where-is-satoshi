During production AMT platforms are equipped with one or more active

vendors worldwide.
In our laboratory environment (see section 3) we have tested and found
that the ZTC remote provisioning can be implemented even while the Intel
AMT functionality is disabled within the BIOS as illustrated in Figure
3.6. Surprisingly the AMT platform broadcasts an ARP request packet upon
connecting to a wired network (typically a LAN) and follows the sequence
described in section 3.7.1. From this point and beyond the attacker
operates the SCS and could manipulate the PC according to his/her
malicious activities (see section 3.7.5) even while the Intel AMT is
disabled in BIOS.

So, please voice your opinions on the respective IETF lists.

@_subject: [Cfrg] Requesting removal of CFRG co-chair 
Dear IRTF Chair, IAB, and CFRG:
I'd like to request the removal of Kevin Igoe from CFRG co-chair.
The Crypto Forum Research Group is chartered to provide crypto advice
to IETF Working Groups.  As CFRG co-chair for the last 2 years, Kevin
has shaped CFRG discussion and provided CFRG opinion to WGs.
Kevin's handling of the "Dragonfly" protocol raises doubts that he is
performing these duties competently.  Additionally, Kevin's employment
with the National Security Agency raises conflict-of-interest
Dragonfly Background
Dragonfly is a "Password-Authenticated Key Exchange" protocol (or
"PAKE").  Dragonfly was proposed to CFRG 2 years ago [PROPOSAL].
Compared to better-known PAKEs, Dragonfly has no security proof, a
lack of extensive security analysis, nonfunctional complications added
for IPR reasons, and some security issues [REVIEW].
Dragonfly became a hot topic recently when the TLS WG disputed CFRG's
alleged report that Dragonfly was "satisfactory", as well as disputing
that this report reflected CFRG consensus [TLS_1].  After extensive
criticism of Dragonfly, the TLS WG ceased work on a Dragonfly
extension [TLS_2].
NSA Background
The National Security Agency ("NSA") is a U.S. Intelligence Agency
which is believed to devote considerable resources to:
 - "Influence policies, standards and specifications for commercial
public key technologies"
 - "Shape the worldwide cryptography marketplace to make it more
tractable to advanced cryptanalytic capabilities" [BULLRUN]
While much is unknown about these activities, the NSA is known to have
placed a "back door" in a NIST standard for random number generation
[ECDRBG].  A recent report from the President's Review Group
recommends that the NSA:
 - "fully support and not undermine efforts to create encryption standards"
 - "not in any way subvert, undermine, weaken, or make vulnerable
generally available commercial software" [PRESIDENTS]
This suggests the NSA is currently behaving contrary to the recommendations.
Reasons for requesting Kevin's removal
1)  Kevin has provided the *ONLY* positive feedback for Dragonfly that
can be found on the CFRG mailing list or meeting minutes.  The
contrast between Kevin's enthusiasm and the group's skepticism is
striking [CFRG_SUMMARY].  It's unclear what this enthusiasm is based
on.  There's no record of Kevin making any effort to understand
Dragonfly's unusual structure, compare it to alternatives, consider
possible use cases, or construct a formal security analysis.
2)  Twice Kevin suggested a technique for deriving the Dragonfly
password-based element which would make the protocol easy to break
[IGOE_1, IGOE_2].  He also endorsed an ineffective attempt to avoid
timing attacks by adding extra iterations to one of the loops [IGOE_3,
IGOE_4].  These are surprising mistakes from an experienced
3)  Kevin's approval of Dragonfly to the TLS WG misrepresented CFRG
consensus, which was skeptical of Dragonfly [CFRG_SUMMARY].
4)  Kevin's NSA affiliation raises unpleasant but unavoidable
questions regarding these actions.  It's entirely possible these are
just mistakes by a novice chair who lacks experience in a particular
sort of protocol and is being pressured by IETF participants to
endorse something.  But it's hard to escape an impression of
carelessness and unseriousness in Kevin's work.  One wonders whether
the NSA is happy to preside over this sort of sloppy crypto design.
While that's of course speculation, it remains baffling that an
experienced cryptographer would champion such a shoddy protocol.  The
CFRG chairs have been silent for months, and haven't responded to
attempts to clarify this.
The position of CFRG chair (or co-chair) is a role of crucial
importance to the IETF community.  The IETF is in desperate need of
trustworthy crypto guidance from parties who are above suspicion.  I
encourage the IAB and IRTF to replace Kevin Igoe with someone who can
provide this.
Thanks for considering this request.

I agree. I was asked to review and test a CryptoPhone (and I still use

On Codes on Conduct
Allan MacGregor 1 day ago
Recently, there has been a lot of controversy and discussion surrounding
the adoption of a code of conduct for the PHP project; there has been
endless back and forth between proponents and opponents of the motion.
Iâve debated if I should publish my opinions on the subject or simply
remain quite and hope for the best; however as emails from the internals
list continued to flood my inbox, I found it harder and harder to just
sit idly silent.
The following article(s) are heavily opinionated and there is a very
good chance that you will disagree with my position and my arguments,
the topic by is very nature is extremely contentious and of a sensitive
nature. However, they say that disagreement fosters communication and
the exchange of ideas; and Iâm hoping that is true in this case. With
that said, letâs jump into the topic at hand and start talking about
code of conduct.
Unfortunately, as most things in the real world it is not as simple as
it sounds and we need to at least be aware of the consequences, side
effects, and political baggage documents like a code of conduct can have.
Letâs start by taking a closer look to the Code of Conduct original
proposed for the PHP project:
If we are truly talking about creating a welcoming and open community,
then we need to listen and address the concerns of detractors as much as
we do for the proponents of the CoC; after all, the goal is equality and
fairness; is it not?
Even without accounting for this scenario, getting banned from
contribution under the accusation of misconduct could cause problems in
the real world and their work; you could get you banned from
conferences, affect publishing deals, in short, it could royally mess up
with your career.
As it stands, the current proposal for the Code of Conduct has hit an
impasse; the more the discussion seems to go on, the more it seems that
the proposal is attempting to setup a mini-judicial system; and speaking
candidly, the PHP community is not capable of pulling this off.

@_subject: Fwd: announcing: txmix, a twisted python mixnet library 
Hi. I'd like to announce txmix, a library for writing mixnets in python.
txmix is GPL3 licensed and currently depends on:
sphinxmixcrypto, Twisted, txtorcon, attrs, eliot
and Tor Project's chutney (for integration tests).
txmix allows you to write mixnets with reduced code complexity and
transport agnosticism... however I've choosen to focus my development
efforts on the Tor onion transport for several reasons, the onion
transport has some properties which the UDP transport does not:
- reliability
- forward secrecy
- NAT penetration
Additionally the Tor anonymity properties are a welcome bonus since
they aren't really overlapping with those of the mixnet, they are
vulnerable to different types of attacks and accomodate for totally
different threat models.
Currently txmix has some integration tests that use chutney to spin up
a local 25 relay tor network; builds a mixnet using onion services
as the transport and then tests functionality by sending and receiving
messages on the mixnet.
future development
- txmix could certainly be used to write various kinds of mixnets,
however, we are missing a PKI. Without some kind of public key
infrastructure how will mix clients learn about mix public keys?
- sphixmixcrypto library needs improvements that would allow us
to specify more message types such as dummy/cover traffic message
and heartbeat messages. These of course are essential for the defense
against certain known active attacks against some mix types.
questions, code review and pull requests welcome.
