Why should a terrorist use a North American provider that would hand all its logs and intercept mail given a warrant or now may be even by a simple "help us hunt them down" ? Why telling FBI what ISPs to put Carnivores first ?

Does NSA need compromising US-based CA's private keys ? Probably not, because they either
(a) already have the private keys, obtained thru a combination of political, financial and intelligence resources.
or (b) already have proceedings with the CA's in order to issue valid look-a-like certificates for any domain they want.  If you look from the NSA's point of view, the investment might still sound reasonable for cracking the private keys.
