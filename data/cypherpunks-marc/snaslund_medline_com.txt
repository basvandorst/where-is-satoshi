Of all the legal advice I've seen posted to NANOG, I think this might be
the first time it's come from a lawyer.
Great post, Anne. Thanks for the advice.
On Aug 22, 2012, at 11:17 , "Anne P. Mitchell, Esq."
several major ISPs, including AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast,  have agreed.
(a "copyright alert") to their user (without giving up the user to the
warning.  In total there is a series of six warnings, with "mitigation
measures" accompanying the fifth and sixth warning.
agreement, or not - I would say that the first order is to *put your
policy around copyright alerts in writing* - asap - and make it as
specific as possible - and then *ALWAYS FOLLOW IT EVERY SINGLE TIME*.
it's reasonable, but it matters that it be followed to the letter every
time, no exceptions.
it's still not a bad idea to structure your policy to follow the six
"copyright alert" structure, because there is some precedent there, and
then you come off looking like you are trying to do the right thing,
which will make you a less easy target.

If he is claiming that the traffic to the forum came through the Tor
node, that IP would lead them to the hosting company of the Tor node.
Not his residence.  If they had an IP that led to his home, that would
have to mean that the traffic did not come from his Tor node at the ISP.
I suppose you could get your own block of addresses and get the ISP to
advertise them for you to host your server but I don't think you would.
If they got his address from the hosting company, I suppose that might
lead them to his house but it also would have told them that the Tor
node was not AT his house.  Why go there?  I think they have something
else.  There are lots of terabytes for them to look at.  Who wants to

How about:
Police have seen CP and have logs from "Additionally, I was accused of
sharing (and possibly producing) child pornography on a clearnet forum
via an image hosting site that was probably tapped."
Police look at IP addresses that have accessed the images for those that
are within their jurisdiction.
Police find an address within a block that is registered to Wiliam.
Police raid William and receive an education on TOR exit nodes on
servers in Poland.
Why wouldn't the IP address have led to William?

You do realize that it is completely common for "looking" at them to
take months.
This is a big thing to people in this community, because the police will
happily come and confiscate the tools you need to do your job, and not
return them for months, years, or sometimes even ever, even in cases
where it seems fairly straightforward to identify that the person has
done nothing wrong.  The police, and many of the policies surrounding
this issue, often assume that the party is guilty, and also assume that
seizure isn't a significant professional issue.

Until they search they have no factual basis for the presumptions either
that more than one computer was associated with the activity or that it
isn't possible to readily identify which computer was involved. That Tor
node was probably on a static IP address and was probably  on the same
static IP address at the time of the alleged activity.
"Reasonable suspicion" doesn't mean Bob thinks you did it, it means that
there's a trail of facts which lead *directly* to the evidence you seek
permission to seize. The trail to child porn doesn't include the right
to seize the stack of John Denver music and while it might include the
right to search the shelf of DVDs it doesn't include the right to seize
the ones produced by Disney. The right to search your computer and the
right to seize it are not at all the same thing.
Practically speaking, right now the police are going to seize all your
computers. But keep watching. Some time in the next decade or two
warrants will start to get quashed for failing to specify (by
parameters) *which* computer they were looking for. As computers become
more central to our lives it will probably come out that they have the
right to duplicate your hard drives and other read/write media but don't
have a right to take the originals unless they observe warrant-covered
material *on* the computer while searching.

I didn't say anything about trying to run away.  That probably won't accomplish a whole lot in the long run.   But when all of your bank accounts and credit cards are frozen, and your house is a crime scene,
at least you have the means to rent a hotel room, contact
family/lawyers, etc.
And no, I'm not OK with people keeping any money that was donated for a
specific purpose in excess of what was actually used.  You'd hope that
he'd be a good guy about it and give back the portion that wasn't used,
or clearly state that any excess will go to charity or something.  However, there's no such guarantee (short of doing it through a trust
fund with his lawyer), and just like any philanthropic venture, it's up to each donor choose when/if they'll help out.   It's just like Kickstarter -- you hope to get something good out of it, but if it

When is the last time you were arrested, or even in a legal situation
which required your attention as a defendant? It seems pretty straight
forward, but I can assure you this guy is getting very little sleep and
his heart is beating out of his chest. Granted this entire situation is
taking place in a legal venue which I have no understanding of (The EU
obviously does things differently). I think it was pretty risky to
consider running a Tor node, much less being involved in running
multiple nodes. This entire situation is beginning to read like a Kim
DotCom (or Schmitz for those of us who worked for him at some point)
novel, where an outside force directed a local LEA to perform some kind
of raid to get someone's attention. This was obviously not a helicopter
raid with SWAT, ala RapidShare, but I hope you get the point. This guy
is sweating bullets because he has no idea what is going to happen next
(in my humble opinion), so his rational thought process and/or even
discussing when he will return the funds donated is a pre-mature at

Anyone who DOESN'T have such things stashed away somewhere is, IMHO,
incredibly naive and taking on quite a large amount of risk.
The likelihood (and hope) is that you'll never need it.  But on the off
chance that you get f***ed by the legal system because of some power
hungry, mouth-breather cop who can't/won't understand that you've done
nothing wrong -- or worse, that you're easily provably within the law,
but he "believes" that you're not and drags you through the process
anyways -- you'll be very happy that you stashed away that old unlocked
cell phone, old laptop, change of clothes and cash.
I'm a (legal) firearms owner... up here in Canada, where some previous
governments enacted extreme anti-gun legislation, that pretty much means
that if I so much as sneeze in a way that a cop doesn't like, I can have
my life ruined pretty damned fast (not quite, but really close).  I
wouldn't bet against me having an excrement-hitting-the-oscillator stash
like this guy does.  ;)
(Note:  I don't mean to imply that all cops are power hungry mouth-breathers intent on destroying the lives of citizens.   Most cops are fundamentally good people and do a great job.  But like every other
profession, there ARE bad cops out there, and it's within the realm of
possibility that you'll deal with one of them one day.)
If you think that legal costs in a criminal case only start when you've been formally charged, you're grossly misinformed.   At what point you personally decide to donate is one thing, but implying that someone
doesn't need a defense fund prior to charges being laid is a bit naive
about how the process works.

you are innocent, your answer is to grab your stuff and go on the lamb

stuff, and leave town.  I think you have seen way to many movies.

Anyone who DOESN'T have such things stashed away somewhere is, IMHO,
incredibly naive and taking on quite a large amount of risk.
The likelihood (and hope) is that you'll never need it.  But on the off
chance that you get f***ed by the legal system because of some power
hungry, mouth-breather cop who can't/won't understand that you've done
nothing wrong -- or worse, that you're easily provably within the law,
but he "believes" that you're not and drags you through the process
anyways -- you'll be very happy that you stashed away that old unlocked
cell phone, old laptop, change of clothes and cash.
I'm a (legal) firearms owner... up here in Canada, where some previous
governments enacted extreme anti-gun legislation, that pretty much means
that if I so much as sneeze in a way that a cop doesn't like, I can have
my life ruined pretty damned fast (not quite, but really close).  I
wouldn't bet against me having an excrement-hitting-the-oscillator stash
like this guy does.  ;)
(Note:  I don't mean to imply that all cops are power hungry=20
mouth-breathers intent on destroying the lives of citizens.   Most cops=20
are fundamentally good people and do a great job.  But like every other
profession, there ARE bad cops out there, and it's within the realm of
possibility that you'll deal with one of them one day.)
If you think that legal costs in a criminal case only start when you've=20
been formally charged, you're grossly misinformed.   At what point you=20
personally decide to donate is one thing, but implying that someone
doesn't need a defense fund prior to charges being laid is a bit naive
about how the process works.

You are correct about most people not falling under CALEA.  That also
means that they do not have the "safe harbor" provisions provided to
facilities based providers (however an open wireless hotspot MIGHT just
make you a wireless facilities based provider).  You are not under an
obligation to provide data under CALEA but a court can order you collect
that data going forward, allow LE to tap a device, or just seize the
server to study it anytime they feel you may have evidence of a crime.
A court can seize almost anything from anyone as long as a judge thinks
it is a reasonable search and seizure.  If you provide someone with any
kind of tools or services (free or not) you are opening yourself up to a
liability.  If you are in physical possession of a server that contains
kiddie porn you are likely to go to jail.  I am not saying this Tor
server has data like that onboard (but I suppose there could be caches,
temp files, and such) but they are going to look until they understand
it.  You may very well be able to defend your right to a Tor server but
it is certainly going to cost you a lot of money and I am sure it is
going to be uncomfortable to explain why you want to have one to a judge
when LE explains all the evil uses for one.
When it comes to running an open access point, I think the legal issue
would be negligence.  Is it negligence for the 90 year old grandma to
have an open AP (probably not, just didn't know better)?  Is it
negligence for me to have an open AP (probably, I am a network
professional and know how to secure a network).
As a long time service provider I can tell you that a lot of CALEA
enforcement has to do with good faith more than the letter of the law.
If your policy is to delete logs after 30 days and the cops show up on
day 31, no big deal.  If they show up at day 5 and you say you dump your
logs at day 4, expect to get grilled.  They can tell real quick if you
are cooperating to the best of your ability.  In the early Internet
days, before the CALEA applied to ISPs I had to try to work with LE to
comply with court orders and often we explained the technology and
limitations of it to the FBI.  We were even involved in expert testimony
to explain how this "Internet Stuff" worked.  Often we did not have the
data they wanted but there were ways to get it for an ongoing
investigation.  Our policy was to not provide specific data without a
court order but we would begin collecting it as soon as a LE agent told
us they were going to try to obtain it.  It was just a professional
courtesy to them.  I know there is a big counter-culture, no big
brother, no regulation attitude toward a lot of Internet issues but I
have seen some sick cases involving emailed threats (later carried out)
and kids that made me give the law the benefit of the doubt in a lot of
cases.  There are lots of evil people out there and the Internet is a
big tool for them.
I have no statistics to back this up (and no one probably does) but with
my many years of experience in engineering ARPANET, MILNET, and the
Internet I would have to guess that most Tor servers are used for no
good much more than they are protecting anyone's privacy.  I am guessing
that a ton of the Tor traffic is likely to be BitTorrent that is just as
likely copyrighted material.  That does not mean that Tor or BitTorrent
is evil but as network professionals we all know (wink, wink) what that
kind of stuff is really mainly used for. That probably does not affect
your legal rights to have a Tor server but certainly affects my decision
to donate to your defense if you get in a legal case.
This is certainly an interesting discussion and I think there are not a
lot of concrete answers since this is on the edge of technology law.  I
do think history shows us that while the government lags behind, they
will eventually find a way to control this if it suits them and becomes
a source of pain for them.

DHCP assignments, you are in similar straights.
If they come to you 31 days after the data flow and you retain logs for

If someone faked their wireless MAC and the data in your log is not

The assertion being made here, that it's somehow illegal (or immoral, or

1. Running open access wireless does not make you legally an ISP and if
your open wireless is used to commit a crime you could be criminally

"ISP like protections" for that.  If you do not take action as soon as
you know a crime is being committed, you are going to get nailed.=20
The question in this case would be all about whether the Tor exit node
is viewed as a device specifically enabling a criminal or something that
was incidentally used to commit a crime.  For example, if I give you a
hammer and you break into someone's house with it, I am probably not
criminally negligent.  If I provided you with lock picking equipment and
you are not a locksmith, I might be criminally negligent.  This is not
so clear cut a case that there would not be a fight about it.

The analogy of a small free access ISP and a Tor exit node is legally
defensible.  I know of five, six, seven that I can think of off the top

been architect or operations lead for 5 or more commercial ISPs.
Even more, ISP like protections are extended in the US to many "end

"publishing" content but not creating it or exerting control over it,
This is US specific, and the case of a user in Austria is entirely

The entire point of Tor is to be untraceable back to the source.  Egress
filters can prevent future abuse but do not provide for tracing back to
the original source of offending conduct. They are not trying to stop
the flow of the data in this case, they want the source in jail.  If law
enforcement comes to you and asks you to show them the source or
destination on a case like the one in question, you cannot comply and if
law enforcement asks you to trap this data in the future you will also
have a problem complying because I think you cannot identify the
original source.=20
You ARE providing a network if you are running a Tor exit node just the
same as someone who builds a MPLS VPN would be responsible for
responding to law enforcement requests for data inside the secure
network.  A licensed LEC and CLEC has very specific requirements in
terms of CALEA and DCMA.  It is not something they optionally comply
with. An ISP that does not respond to CALEA and DCMA can become liable
for events that happen after their non-response.  Their "safe harbor"
protection ends the moment they do not act in good faith to comply with
the law. =20
Even a small ISP that does not own their own network can be subpoenaed
to provide logs, sniffer traces, and file dumps from any system they
own.  I know this for a fact and have provided this data under court
orders.  CALEA applies just as well to servers and data as it does to
the communication circuits themselves.  If you have a server on the
network, it has a communications circuit into it and you can be required
to provide access to that circuit.  You can also be required to tap
email accounts or data directories as well.  This data may not fall
strictly under CALEA but a court order can compel you to provide any
data you are in possession of.  That is why law enforcement can grab a
server or PC.  ISPs and carriers are often given the benefit of the
doubt and law enforcement accepts copies of data they want.  If they
view you as an adversary or have any inclination of hiding data, they
will seize the machine.  If they view a Tor exit node owner as an
accessory, they are not going to be nicey nice about it.
The main problem with Tor is that it purposefully attempts to make this
data obscure which could be construed as obstruction.  As far as US law
enforcement attitudes on Tor, those can and will change as the
government sees fit.  It is all a matter of the "greater good" in their
eyes and whether they think the fight is worthwhile.  You better believe
that as soon as it becomes a "national security threat" it is coming

generated that someone's using it to source child porn or terrorist
communications or DMCA violations.  At the most extreme the owner can
shut down a node; they might also put egress filters in place pursuant
to notifications.
Plenty of small ISPs in one sense or another don't comply with CALEA
because they own systems not networks (open access sites, etc).  CALEA
goes to the network providers in those cases, as I understand it.
The Tor owner also might chose to fight it and leave it completely open,

aware of what Tor is in the US and be generally reasonable in responding
to issues with it, that I know of.

I think service providers are afforded special protections because the
law recognizes their utility and the inability of the service provider
to be responsible for the actions of all of their customers.  The major
problem is that not every individual has the same protections.  A lot of
ISPs are actually also CLECs or LECs that are protected as licensed
telecom carriers.
ISPs also do not "allow strangers to do whatever they want"  ISPs have
responsibilities to act on DCMA notices and CALEA requests from law
enforcement.  These are things that Tor exit nodes are not capable of
doing.  If you were an ISP and could not respond to CALEA requests, you
will find yourself out of business in a big hurry.

I think the best analogy I would use in defense is something like the
pre-paid cellular phones that are sold.  That is about the only
anonymous communications service I can think of off the top of my head.
Problem is that most people are not licensed carriers and may not be
able to hide behind that protection. =20
I can see an argument both ways with the feds saying that you are
running a service for the express service of concealing the identity of
a person allowing them to avoid law enforcement (among other uses).  On
the other hand, the makers of guns do not get charged with murder even
though their tool enabled a criminal.  Could go either way but the
problem is that in any case it will be expensive to defend so win or
lose, you lose.  I guess you can't run a Tor exit unless you have a
legal defense fund set up.  I understand the legit uses of Tor but
wonder what the actual percentage of good vs. evil use really is.

Back in the early days of the public internet we didn't require any id
to create an account, just that you found a way to pay us. We had
anonymous accts some of whom dropped by personally to pay their bill,
some said hello but I usually didn't know their names and that's how
they wanted it, I'd answer "hello ", whatever their login was
if I recognized them. Some mailed in something, a mail order, even
currency tho that was rare but it did happen, or had someone else drop
by to pay in cash (that is, no idea if they were local.)
LEO occasionally served a warrant for information, usually child porn
biz (more than just accessing child porn, selling it) tho I don't
remember any anonymous accts being involved.
I never expected to be held accountable for anyone's behavior unless I
was knowingly involved somehow (just the usual caveat.) LEO never showed
any particular interest in the fact that we were ok with anonymous
accounts. If I was made aware of illegal activities we'd shut them off,
didn't really happen much, maybe some credible "hacking" complaint on
It's funny, it's all illusion like show business. It's not hard to set
up anonymous service, crap, just drop in at any wi-fi hotspot, many just
ask you to click that you accept their T&Cs and you're on. Would they
raid them, I was just using one at a major hospital this week that was
just like that, if someone used that for child porn etc? But I guess
stick your nose out and say you're specifically offering anon accts and
watch out I guess.

How would this be legally different than receiving the illegal content
in an envelope and anonymously forwarding the envelope via the post
office?  I am pretty sure you are still liable since you were the
sender.  I realize that there are special postal regulations but I think
that agreeing to forward anything for anyone sight unseen is pretty
risky and I think you will have a hard time pulling of the "service
provider" defense if you are not selling services and are not licensed
as a carrier.

Isn't William's problem because he used an IP address that was
registered to him on the Polish server?  If not, what am I missing?
SANS has chimed in via their latest Newsbites:
--TOR Operator Charged For Content Sent Through His Servers (November 29
& 30, 2012) An Austrian man who operated TOR servers has been charged
with distributing child pornography. Authorities detected the images
passing through the servers maintained by the man. Police seized 20
computers and other equipment from William Weber's home. TOR is an
acronym for The Onion Router, a project developed by the US Naval
Research Laboratory that allows people surf the web anonymously. It is
often used by political dissidents, journalists, and law enforcement
officers, and has also been used by criminals. The offending images were
being distributed by a server in Poland and sent through Weber's
servers. Weber operated exit servers; traffic from these nodes can be
traced back to the servers' IP addresses. While the authorities became
"friendlier" after understanding where the images came from, there is a
precedent for holding TOR operators liable for content that passes
through servers they operate. The Electronic Frontier Foundations
acknowledges the risk that accompanies operating exit nodes and advises
that "it's best not to run your exit relay in your home or using your
home Internet connection."
[Editor's Note (Ullrich): IMHO, the TOR operator acted like a transit
ISP/NSP in this case.
(Hoan): In many countries it is not illegal to run a Tor exit node.
However, for anyone considering, or are already, running a Tor exit node
you should familiarise yourself with the Electronic Frontier
Foundation's Legal FAQ on the topic at

I think it is a fallacious debate to discuss whether Tor servers or
services are illegal or legal.  Like any other tool, it is all about
intent.  I know that as engineering types we tend to not like relativism
but the law is very much about that.  Intent is ultimately very critical
to obtaining a criminal conviction.  Every day someone does something
that might otherwise be considered a crime but because of intent is
For example,
****I shoot a bear out of season, this is a crime right?   What if I
told you the bear was attacking a four year old little girl, does that
change your mind?
****It is not a crime to send an encoded letter.  It is a crime to send
an encoded letter that communicates an impending attack on someone.
****It is not a crime to make a phone call.  It is a crime to make a
telephonic bomb threat.
****A gun is not a crime.  Shooting someone is a crime (mostly).
****An ISP selling internet service that most people use for legal
purposes is not doing anything illegal when someone uses it to illegally
share music because they did not intend to commit a crime.
****If you build a server solely for hosting copyrighted software for
illegal distribution, you are a criminal.  If someone hacks your FTP
server and hides a piece of copyrighted software there for illegal
distribution you are probably not a criminal as long as you take some
action to prevent the crime once you are aware of it.

It's a service on the infrastructure. I never implied that the traffic
through/from the ISP or the TOR was more or less legal than the other.

of a crime, I am probably committing a crime. =20
The service provider that sold me the connection is not at fault here
because they have no way of knowing what I am up to in the normal course
of their business.  I don't know where anyone got the idea that
communications is private from law enforcement with the proper
authorizations.  Your phone can be traced or tapped under the laws of
most countries, the only difference is the level of control.  Even
though we may all view some groups in China, Syria, Sudan, or wherever
as dissidents, their own governments may view them as terrorists and you
will probably get in trouble for helping them.  I would guess (but don't
know) that it is illegal to communicate covertly inside of China.  It is
probably also some sort of crime to circumvent their firewall
protections.  I am not making the right vs wrong case here but be
advised that what might be philanthropic in one country could very well
be a crime in another.
 A lot of the law (and moral decision making in general ) is about
intent.  If the guy was trying to help people protect themselves from
totalitarian regimes and such then he is probably morally and legally
innocent of a crime.  If the guy was building a covert network for what
the police allege, he is guilty.  If he was pirating movies and someone
else was using it for child crimes then he is partial responsible in my
moral opinion.  I am not familiar enough with German law to tell you if
he is legally guilty or not. =20

I know I'm going to get flamed and excoriated, but here goes....
This is a misleading statement. ISP's (Common carriers) do not provide a
knowingly illegal offering, AND they do provide the PHYSICAL
infrastructure for packets to be passed and interconnected to other
PHYSICAL networks. TOR exit/entrance nodes provide only the former. The
lack of providing a physical infrastructure is crucial. Also, most ISP's
(US specifically) are required by Law (under subpoena) to provide
details to law enforcement.
I really hate this idea of privacy on the Internet. If you really think
you have the "right" to use the public infrastructure (to whatever
extent you want to label the Internet as such) and be completely
anonymous, I have a bridge to sell you. Network operators may treat your
packets to whatever level of scrutiny that they may find necessary to
determine if they want to pass your packets, keeping in mind that good
operators want the Internet to work.
I'm waiting for the next hot "application" to use a widely known "bad"
port and see what happens. :)
I'm actually in agreement that law enforcement may have overstepped here
if the only reason was the TOR exit point, but having a TOR exit point
to me, seems to be condoning the actions/statements/packets used through
the exit point. You are knowingly hiding information that your local
government may require you to disclose.
Short answer... don't use TOR. It's not a bad thing, but it's not a good
thing either.

Here is something else to consider :
Why will just about any ISP shut down a customer with an open mail
relay?  It allows anonymous access to anyone trying to send an email,
right.  So why would this not be considered just as "free speech" as the
Tor server.  The reason I believe is because we as an industry decided
that spam was a "bad thing" before it even became illegal.   In the case
of Tor, it largely enables anonymous transfer of data (like copyrighted
bit torrent traffic) including some content that is blatently illegal to
even possess.    As a community we have been a lot less decisive about
that subject. =20
Before we chastise the legal process being used by the government just
consider everything we do as service providers under the guise of
"acceptable use" which has just about no basis in the law.  Most
"acceptable use" violations are basically doing stuff we don't like.  =20
As far as the Internet just being a tool, I agree but there are and
always have been laws to govern the use of tools whether we are talking
about telephones, guns, postal system, or any other tool.   Conducting
the alleged business over the telephone would be a crime just as sending
it through the postal system.  If you were encrypting voice calls for
the sole purpose of avoiding a legal wiretap I think the law might have
a problem with that.  If you were to provide that service to someone
like a kidnapper or the mafia, I bet you are going to have some tough
questions thrown at you.
As I see it, here are the possible reasons this individual set up this
Tor network :
1.  This man is truly the saint of the Internet privacy community and he
spent his own hard earned money to set up a bunch of off shore Tor
servers for the benefit of mankind.  Why he needs exit nodes in the
United States and Poland I am not sure about.  Is the German government
cracking down a lot on dissident traffic coming out of servers in his
own country?  He must not be able to pay his own legal expenses because
he is too busy building servers for the good of humanity.
2.  This guy was using Tor for whatever personal reasons.  Could be that
there were not enough exit nodes to get the kind of performance he
wanted.  Maybe he was downloading / uploading various content, legal or
illegal and was serious enough about it that he set up exit nodes in
multiple countries.  That might explain the ton of storage he had at his
residence.  Maybe he has a big recipe collection, pirated movie
collection, or unspeakable content the police are looking at now.  The
content will say if he is innocent or guilty.  Maybe he was using it for
one thing and others were using it for something else.  In that case, my
thoughts are if you swim with sharks you might get bit.
3.  Maybe this guy was running a Tor network as a paid service for
others not wanting to get caught doing whatever they were doing.   Could
be a lucrative business for an enterprising system admin I suppose.  You
would not want to set up these servers at your own workplace right, and
maybe you have customers in multiple countries.  Who might want a covert
communications network?  Drug cartels, media pirates, intelligence
agencies, terrorists, illegal child porn producers, whoever does not
want to get caught communicating.  Maybe even downtrodden dissidents but
they likely don't have a lot of money.  He is going to need your money
to defend himself because the government will gets suspicious if he
shows up with another safe deposit box of cash and his customer
certainly can't be contacted to help.
I see these possible outcomes :
1. The guy has nothing on his home computers or the Tor server that
point to a crime and he gets his stuff back.  Inconvenient no doubt but
he won't need that legal defense fund.
2.  Maybe this guy is as serious about his home gear as his network
privacy.  Maybe everything at home is deep encrypted.  Unlikely it will
be secure enough but maybe the government has its suspicions but cannot
make the case and they drop it.
2. The guy has tons of illegal content on his home storage stuff and
gets nailed for it.  That legal defense fund is going to be paying the
SPA, RIAA, or whoever else is going to sue him.  If it what the police
allege then he is going away for quite awhile.
3. The guy is innocent but gets found guilty because "the man" just does
not like Tor.   Your legal defense fund probably won't help much because
if "the man" wants him locked up with no evidence then your defense
probably won't help a lot.  You will be better off selling "Free Mother
Tor-esa" T-shirt to try to get him sprung.
I might be a cynic but I am just not thinking it is  on these lists.

@_subject: RE: NYT covers China cyberthreat 
First thing is the Chinese government would rejoice since they don't
want their citizens on our networks (except the ones they recruit for
cyber warfare, they can get other address ranges for those guys). =20
Second thing is someone will make a ton of money bouncing Chinese
traffic through somewhere else (and someone will create a SPAMHAUS like
service to detect that, and so on, and so on, and so on)
Third thing is all the companies that do business in and around China
would be screaming because tons of them use VPNs that are sourced from
Chinese IP address space.  Some people even like to travel and access
things back home, you know weird stuff, like email, news, music, videos.
One of the biggest problems with geoblocking is that often the addresses
do not reveal the true source of the traffic.  If you block everything
from China, you miss attacks sourced from China that are bouncing
through bot networks with hosts worldwide.  Remember Tor, it is built to
defeat just that sort of security by obscuring source locations.
Corporations also often have egress points to the Internet in countries
other than the one the user is in.  If you block everything from China,
then you are locking out any of your own personnel that travel
Internationally or any of your customers that travel.  Who here has not
surfed the web from a hotel room on business.  Anyone with malicious
intent has a zillion ways to bypass that sort of security.  Obscuring
your source address is child's play.  The management of the geoblocking
will not be worth the minimal protection it provides.  Trying to locate
someone by address is a complete PITA in my opinion.  If you go to
Europe you will often get sent to the wrong Google sites because they
attempt to locate you instead of just letting you put in the correct URL
(if you are in the UK, it is not that hard to include .co.uk in your
URL.  I have been in the UK and gotten Google Germany and Google Spain
for no apparent reason (except that carriers in Europe have addresses
from all over the place because of mergers, alliances, and all sort of
other arrangements).
Blocking networks by service will also be a management nightmare since
addresses often change and new blocks get assigned and companies offer
different services.  Who manages all of that and who is going to tell
you when something changes (the answer is nobody, you will know when
stuff breaks).  If my network security guy had enough time to keep track
of all of Amazon's address space and what services they are offering
this week and all the services they host in their datacenters, I would
fire him for having that much time on his hands.  Can you keep track of
all the stuff coming from Akamai and where all their servers are at on a
continuing basis?  Cloud services will make blocking by service nearly
impossible since the network can reconfigure at any time.
I would love to see this implementation in a large corporate or
government network.  What a huge game of whack a mole that is.  Seems to
me that the time would be much better spent tuning up firewalls and
securing hosts properly.=20
I think geoblocking gives you nothing but a false sense of security.  I
also believe that if you see an attack coming from China in particular
it is because they WANT you to know it is coming from China.  I would
think any state sponsor conducting a very serious attack would conceal
themselves better than that.  I also believe that a lot of attacks that
look like they are coming from China are actually coming from elsewhere.
Think about this,  if I am a hacker in the US, attacking a US victim, it
would be a big advantage to look like I was coming from China because it
almost guarantees no attempt to prosecute or track me down since
everyone in this business knows that if it comes out of China you can't
do anything about it.  I would not be surprised to find out China is
letting their capabilities be known just to remind everyone of what the
implications of messing with them is.  Remember Doctor Strangelove,
"what good is a doomsday bomb if you don't tell anyone about it ?!?!?"

Well, if they're eBay, probably.  If they're Joe's Fill Dirt and

is ever actually going to purchase a truckload of dirt or a tasty
croissant from Joe.  So would it actually matter if they couldn't get to
Joe's web site or Joe's mail server or especially Joe's VPN server?
Probably not.
Nobody in Peru, Egypt, or Romania is likely to be buying from Joe any
time soon either.
This is why I've been using geoblocking at the network and host levels
for over a decade, and it works. But it does require that you make an
effort to study and understand your own traffic patterns as well as your
organizational requirements. [1]
I use it on a country-by-country basis (thank you ipdeny.com) and on a
service-by-service basis: a particular host might allow http from
anywhere, but ssh only from the country it's in.  I also deny selected
networks access to selected services, e.g., Amazon's cloud doesn't get
access to port 25 because of the non-stop spam and Amazon's refusal to
do anything about it.  Anything on the Spamhaus DROP or EDROP lists
(thank you Spamhaus) is not part of my view of the Internet.  And so on.
Combined, all this achieves lossless compression of abusive traffic.
This is not a security fix, per se; any services that are vulnerable are
still vulnerable.  But it does cut down on the attack surface as
measured along one axis, which in turn reduces the scope of some
problems and renders them more tractable to other approaches.
An even better approach, when appropriate, is to block everything and
then only enable access selectively.  This is a particularly good idea
when defending things like ssh.  Do you *really* need to allow incoming
ssh from the entire planet?  Or could "the US, Canada, the UK and
Germany" suffice?  If so, then why aren't you enforcing that?
Do you really think it's a good idea to give someone with a 15-million
member global botnet 3 or 5 or 10 brute-force attempts *per bot* before
fail2ban or similar kicks in?  I don't.  I think 0 attempts per most
bots is a much better idea.  Let 'em eat packet drops while they try to
figure out which subset of bots can even *reach* your ssh server.
Which brings me to the NYTimes, and the alleged hacking by the Chinese.
Why, given that the NYTimes apparently handed wads of cash over to
various consulting firms, did none of those firms get the NYTimes to
make a first-order attempt at solving this problem?  Why in the world
was anything in their corporate infrastructure accessible from the 2410
networks and 143,067,136 IP addresses in China?  Who signed off on THAT?
(Yes, yes, I *know* that the NYTimes has staff there, some permanently
and some transiently.  A one-off solution crafted for this use case
would suffice.  I've done it.  It's not hard.  And I doubt that it would
need to work for more than, what, a few dozen of the NYTimes'
7500 employees?  Clone and customize for Rio, Paris, Moscow, and other
locations.  This isn't hard either.  Oh, and lock it out of everything
that a field reporter/editor/photographer doesn't need, e.g., there is
absolutely no way someone coming in through one of those should be able
to reach the subscriber database.)
Two more notes: first, blocking inbound traffic is usually not enough.
Blocks should almost always be bidirectional. [2]  This is especially
important for things like the DROP/EDROP lists, because then spam
payloads, phishes, malware, etc. won't be able to phone home quite so
readily, and while your users will still be able to click on links that
lead to bad things...they won't get there.
Second, this may sound complex.  It's not.  I handle my needs with make,
rsync, a little shell, a little perl, and other similar tools, but
clearly you could do the same thing with any system configuration
management setup.  And with proper logging, it's not hard to discover

going to know detail about every application on the network, but if you
haven't got a vague idea what's going on it's impossible to do capacity

@_subject: RE: The US government has betrayed the Internet. We need to take it back 
I am unclear on what you mean by technical choice.  Are you talking about a=
 technical solution to keep the government from seeing your traffic?  That =
will not work for two main reasons.
1.  The government has a lot more resources and motivation than the average=
 company when it comes to security systems.  They do not have to be profita=
ble, just effective.  Most companies only invest in the security that they =
are required to provide.  As a private entity they will be unlikely to want=
 to get in a technological arms race with the NSA.  Remember these are the =
guys that also design some of the most sophisticated encryption systems in =
the world and have nearly limitless computing power to break such systems. =
 They attract some of the most brilliant mathematical minds in the world an=
d actively pursue these employees.  You are really unlikely to out "securit=
y engineer" the NSA especially since the USG can control legally what techn=
ology you are allowed to use and export.  Who designed your encryption algo=
rithm and which one of your employees is a qualified cryptographer that can=
 assure you that it is secure enough.  Is he qualified to tell you what bac=
kdoors or capability NSA has to break that encryption method?  Do you have =
the technical experts to assure you that no US intelligence service has pen=
etrated your human or technical resources?  Do you think no one in your org=
anization would plug something into your network if it comes with a bag of =
cash or a threat attached to it.  If so, I think the NSA might offer you a =
lucrative job.  Remember these are the same guys who are supposed to break =
the communications of foreign governments and by all accounts are fairly go=
od at it.  I don't want to bet my job on defeating them.
2. If the political environment allows, they will simply pass laws along th=
e lines of CALEA to give them the legal right to tap your traffic.  Even if=
 you won the technological battle they can instantly trump you with key esc=
row and other such legal force means to defeat you.  If the political will =
exists they can pass a law requiring you to pass them all information in pl=
ain text.  Game over, you lose.  Just try to defy a FISA court order or ref=
use a CALEA tap and see how long you are in business.  There is always a de=
bate of privacy vs security and there always has been in one form or the ot=
her.  This is expressed by the people of this country in their political an=
d economic choices.  I know it does not seem like it sometimes but the gove=
rnment will only do what the majority of the people will accept most of the=
 time.  Every decision a politician makes is a balance between what he want=
s and what he thinks he can get away with.  He want the information but it =
is only useful if he maintains his access to power.
As you see, the ONLY solution is the political will to limit the government=
s powers. The only way that is done is to threaten the power structure or f=
inancial structure.  The history of the best technical solution winning ins=
ide the US Government structure is pretty weak.  POSIX compliance, ADA prog=
ramming, need I say more?  I say this as a former network engineer in the U=
nited States Air Force.  As far as both parties being responsible for this,=
 I agree completely. Everyone knows that information is power and everyone =
wants as much information as they can get.  The only way to influence that =
is to make the cost of illegal information collection too high a price to p=
ay for the politicians.  The NSA will only use the technology they are allo=
wed to use by whomever is in power.  No one over there wants to go to jail =
and most government employees do not want to put their neck on the line if =
they know there is no safety net.  The Director of NSA answers to the Presi=
dent.  His job is to get the information the USG wants and not get anyone f=
ired doing it.  Everything he does is about that balance.  If he does not d=
o it, the President will appoint someone who does.  Historically the NSA is=
 directed by a General officer from the military.  They generally follow th=
e orders they are given by the President and that is where the power really=
 lies.  It is the job of the Congress to oversee that and ensure the limita=
tions are being followed.  If that is not happening, it is up to the citize=
ns to replace the President or Congress with someone who will follow the wi=
ll of the people.

I think that Schneier's got it right.  The solution has to be both technica=
l and political, and must optimize for two functions: catch the bad guys, w=
hile protecting the rights of the good guys.
When the time comes for the political choices to be made, the good technica=
l choices must be the only ones available.
Security engineering must pave the way to the high road -- so that it's the=
 only road to get there.

The error in this whole conversation is that you cannot "take it back" as a=
n engineer.  You do not own it.  You are like an architect or carpenter and=
 are no more responsible for how it is used than the architect is responsib=
le that the building he designed is being used as a crack house.  Do Ford e=
ngineers have a "social contract" to ensure that I do not run over squirrel=
s with my Explorer, will they "take it back" if I do so?  The whole "social=
 contract" argument is ridiculous.  You have a contract (or most likely an =
"at will" agreement") with your employer to build what they want and operat=
e it in the way that they want you to.  If it is against your ethics to do =
so, quit.  The companies that own the network have a fiduciary responsibili=
ty to their investors and a responsibility to serve their customers.  If an=
yone is really that bent out of shape by the NSA tactics (and I am not so s=
ure they are given the lack of political backlash) here is what you can do.
In the United States there are two main centers of power that can affect th=
ese policies, the consumer and the voter.
1.  We vote in a new executive branch every four years.  They control and a=
ppoint the NSA director.  Vote them out if you don't like how they run thin=
gs.  Do you think a President wants to maintain power?  Of course they do a=
nd they will change a policy that will get them tossed out (if enough peopl=
e actually care).
2.  The Congress passes the laws that govern telecom and intelligence gathe=
ring.  They also have the power to impeach and/or prosecute the executive b=
ranch for misdeeds.  They will pass any law or do whatever it takes to keep=
 themselves in power.  Again this requires a lot of public pressure.
3.  The companies that are consenting to monitoring (legal or illegal) are =
stuck between two powers.  The federal government's power to regulate them =
and the investors / consumers they serve.  Apparently they are more scared =
of the government even though the consumer can put them out of business ove=
rnight by simply not using their product any more.  If everyone cancelled t=
heir gmail accounts, stopped using Google search, and stopped paying for Go=
ogle placement and ads, their stock would go to zero nearly overnight.  Aga=
in, no one seems to care about the issue enough to do this because I have s=
een no appreciable backlash against these companies.
If a social contract exists at all in the United States, it would be to hol=
d your government and the companies you do business with to your ethical st=
andards.  Another things to remember is that the NSA engineers were probabl=
y acting under their "social contract" to defend the United States from wha=
tever enemies they are trying to monitor and also felt they were doing the =
"right thing".  The problem with "social contracts" is that they are relati=
As far as other countries are concerned, you can affect their policies as w=
ell.  US carriers are peered with and provide transit to Chinese companies.=
  If the whole world is that outraged with what they do, they just need to =
pressure the companies they do business with not to do business with China.

I read all of it, the original article and other references to it.
IMHO, there is no amount of engineering that can fix stupid people doing st=
upid things on both sides of the stupid lines.
By trying to fix what is perceived an engineering issue (seems that China d=
oing the same or worse for many years wasn't an engineering problem) the on=
ly result you will obtain is a budget increase on the counter-engineering e=
fforts, that may represent a big chunk of money that can be used in more ef=
fective ways where it is really needed.
