Forgive my ignorance but why would there be any need to inspect packets for tunnels?  Would the authorities not just ask every ISP to monitor the IPs to which their clients are connecting and if they are Tor nodes then the client must be reported.  AIUI all the ISP can see is that a connection is made to the first Tor node.
