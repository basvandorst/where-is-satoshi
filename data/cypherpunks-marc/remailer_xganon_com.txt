TCPA and Palladium can be forced to restrict 90%+ of all applications at the whim of Bill Gates, or the United States government.
Kitchen knives, on the other hand, are under non-uniform and widely-distributed, uncoordinated control. Even Bill Gates and the United States government acting in concert cannot make all knives become murder weapons, nor make all knives become non-murder weapons.

Namecalling. Possibly your strongest argumentation?
Must have touched quite a raw nerve here. My thanks for your not "spewing oppositional bullshit". And what, pray tell, am I disagreeing with "politically"?
Read first, spew later.
Another of your better argumentation. It is difficult to choose between your vulgar manner or your avoidance of facts, as the better explanation of the failure of your "Internet Bearer Underwriting" ventures.
