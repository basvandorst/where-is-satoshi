I don't think so. The folks who actually do it, are the ones who are going
to best know how to avoid it.  Plenty of TV shows bear this out. :-)
I think that failure to encrypt inter-DC traffic that is on dark fibre is
simply on the presumption that corporations are seeking to protect their
links from the actions of 'unauthorised' people.  The telco theyre
contracting presumably have some sort of privacy agreement with them. No-one else is supposed to be able to get on the wire.  A risk assessment
pre-Snowdon probably didn't make the performance hits, costs, etc of
high-speed rateable encryption, worthwhile - but the paradigm has shifted.
The government is using 'authorisation' to get access to that dark fibre
link (presumably) and that authority is at the heart of the problem.
When reviewing your risk assessment around the presence (or not) of
encryption on your inter-site links, also consider whether the methods of
encryption available to the private sector havn't also been cracked by the
NSA etc. They had the 'golden standard' for crypto, but one has to wonder
whether that standard includes an undocumented backdoor...
