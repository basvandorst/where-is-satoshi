U  A friend of mine was giving an English lesson to a class of adult who had
recently come to live in the United States. After placing quite a number of
everyday objects on a table, he asked various members of the class to give
him the ruler, the book, the pen and so on. The class went very smoothly and
the students seemed interested and serious about the work that they were
engaged in until when my friend turned to an Italian student and said, "Give
me the kays." The man looked surprised and somewhat at a loss. Seeing this,
my friend thought that the student hadn't heard him clearly, so he repeated.
"Give me the kays." The Italian shrugged his shoulders. Then, he threw his
arms around the teacher's neck and kissed him on both cheeks.
A lady lost her handbag in the bustle of shopping at the mall. It was found
by an honest little boy and returned to her. Looking in her purse, she
commented, "Hmmm.... That's funny. When I lost my bag there was a $20 bill
in it. Now there are twenty $1 bills." The boy quickly replied, "That's
right, lady. The last time I found a lady's purse, she didn't have any
change for a reward."
