OK. Why not setup some automatic internal routing so we don't waste exit

I don't want this for piracy as I have a paid VPN account that is much
faster for that if I decide to pirate. I think we need BitTorrent though to
work on Tor so Tor Users can securely share files with one another.

If your so paranoid then encrypt your Tor Browser Bundle with TrueCrypt
then wipe the hard drive and destroy the computer when your done. Traffic
Correlation is next to impossible via Tor. You could also use a VPN then
Tor for more security...
