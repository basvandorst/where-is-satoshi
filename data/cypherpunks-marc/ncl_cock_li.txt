I have been as well, and I've also received that notice from twitter.
I don't think I'm a particularly suspicious or special person to any
government, should we pass this off as a false alarm triggered by using
tor to twitter, or is there a really poor system out there trying to get
at people's accounts for the crime of association with people/projects
of interest?
An odd coincidence too: my e-mail host had its drives confiscated by
authorities[1] about a week after twitter noticed me, but that is almost
certainly nothing to do with me.[2]
