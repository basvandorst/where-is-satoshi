Dear General Manager,
I learned about your accommodation property from Internet and I think that it really fits in our international hotel search engine that allows users from all over the world to search for properties by their location, category and facilities. I will much appreciate if you become a part of it and I offer you to register your accommodation property free of charge in our database. Our site has over 17000 unique visitors and over 180-250 accommodation properties from all over the world applying for registration every day, so I really hope we both can benefit. Our reports show that many visitors are looking for accommodation in your location, so here is the direct link where, if you would like, you can register for free:
I have to say that the order in which accommodation properties appear is by the date they have been registered, so hurry up if you are looking for a leading position.  In case you are interested in additional features for promoting your accommodation on our site like having a web page of your property, appearing on the first places in the search results, distinguishing color, etc., you can go to
If you have any questions or problems, please, visit the FAQ section on our site. Thank you for your time.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon,
Sincerely yours,
Yana Vassileva
