About Time:
The signals data is contained in a conventional EM loop, typical of
1960s design as implemented in most terrestrial and satellite
reconaissance systems.
The clock increment of the signal and a 3rd party note explain how the
digitisation process work, they have found the original EM signal.
EM CRT tubes operating in mid X-Ray band with a closed loop and
frequency increment per time (linear or step) can replicate the entire
2Thz civilian EM signals band in an X carrier AND copy the prior
signals a thousand times over for a thousand years. (0.88s
geostationary circular, 0.133s earth circumference [potential strong
indication of physical design and loop locations])
see: Maxwell-Tube-Cyclotron, typical EM X-Ray beam physics, and a huge
missing assortment of published data on signals in any higher
frequency band than light over the last century.
The originating party apparently has the ability to retool their EM
signals coding system electronics, and have updated their design
multiple times in the sequence of snapshots this last week.
This is why you are not allowed to use the green-blue bands of fiber
optic conductor except in military applications and on-site
networking. (visible light bands are at 420Thz-800Thz, typical (IR+)
fiber is less than 2Thz)
Even with poor carrier band packing and perhaps a few thousand full
spectrum EM reconaissance sources at any time (0hz..400Thz), either by
full carrier replication or indexed frequency carrier per time in a
loop/ring, this system assumably has many decades of reconaissance
Obviously it is time buffered, as they are pulling last years' data out now.
No indication where the ring is, size of structure (aside from these

Here are some specifics on the data types, surprises, and questions:
Originating party requested data services that were 100% onload
guaranteed, specifically indicating source as an analogue signal
digitisation system that did not have sufficient buffer capacity.
Initial requests were for linear buffer but then changed to block file
storage and public NAS capability. A similar request for SQL or
distributed database storage in cloud hosting was also fielded by many
Data structures are standard floats in spherical coordinates for 4D
vectors, include some reference table indexes in most of the formats,
and have some distinct ranges in a "small" selection of sample data:
Time is offset (not unix) close to a western military standard but
varies in density.
Precision of Floats in 3D vector is trimmed, indicating a specific
physical resolution.
One of the electronic signal log files includes a standard signal
characteristic for antenna direction in addition to location vector,
typical of cell and e-war systems. Also includes values that may be
rate of signaling or CPU processor speed(?).
Most of the data uses index values, range is linear 0..count.
Some of the data uses both an index and unique identifier, another set
uses a large bit scope value assumed to be a hash, but its structure
has been identified as a structured tree, possibly a known standard
(described below)
For each structure type, there are additional values related to the
signal characteristics and some indexing/classifier but none related
to a identifiable pattern other than sequentially loaded index tables.
We are very concerned about the consistency of the data, one must
assume that a full SPOOF is possible with calculated generation,
however some selections map accurately into adjusted-coordinate 3D
structures such as office buildings, houses, and viable speed tracking
on highways. A party with direct access is preparing maps. Our
interest is to prepare distributed processing techniques to
consolidate rendering of the entire snapshot.
One set is obviously electronic device data, another is most likely
EM(?) tracking of coin and currency objects, another includes more
precise vectors and a large unique identifier value and is extremely
There is no statistical anomaly of missing data per region (coverage
of entire planet), the density of records is consistent and in all
small selections the data has high correlation with physical locations
including terrain and structures, aircraft routes, highway speeds, and
typical patterns at an accuracy that would require the same knowledge
to artificially generate.
More importantly: The coin & currency tracking data maps FAR TOO
CLEARLY into reasonable commerce patterns, coins into and out of
*registers*, bank trucks and storage. Without a full 3d model and a
huge computational effort to simulate global commerce, it is more
likely that a high precision radar system or sigint capability is
actually tracking these targets.
The large bit scope and header reference of one data set is especially

(possibly cell phones based on movement vectors) and cross-associated
metadata for their communications. Indications are that these are
recon signal dumps of the american sigint system loaded by a major
organized crime syndicate and cover most of last year. There is also a
set of organic tracking signals, assumably covert agent
communications, and another set that appears to be all American and

It is important that the crypto/physics communities prepare primers on the

and 1800s mail-order toys like high voltage coils, x-ray tubes and reactant
materials, geissler tubes, helmholdt and maxwell coils, early hf wired and

More specifics on the sigint system:
This looks like a "Growth Industry" ...
Access to the beam is not restricted, anyone can pull signals out of
the reconaissance loop from any of its exposed vectors.***
Viable areas:
a: Spurrious emissions from tubes or conduit, beam deflection from
interior particles
b: Stray beams passing through field coils but not redirected
c: Direct access to tubes or conduit (any variety of methods)
d: Geo-Magnetic Shift (downlinks)
e: Refractive / deflection (downlinks)
As the rate of geo-magnetic shift continues to deform the containment
of the projected fields used to shape and steer the beams (which may
also have something to do with the sensor itself?), wider areas will
be accessible which are hit with the rogue spot beam from orbital (and
projected field electro-magnetic) guides.
This means almost anyone with a sensor can gather data from the downlinks.
Additionally, spurrious radiation from the terrestrial system is
available around endpoints and field coils, especially from damaged
conduit or particles in the tubes.
Time to raid the libraries for antique books about 1800s-1980s X-Ray
EM physics and electromagnetic wave guides!
It would not be rational to encode the carrier signal unless it was
certain that the encoding would not disrupt signals quality, however
raw X-Rated signals might have been too risky?
[There are Thz ring oscillators, detectors, and various photonic
rings, but properly implemented field-effect lenses, EM field vector
control circuitry and coils(/phased array) (abstract field
projection), and optimal tube design are all that should
theorhetically be needed once a rogue beam is identified. X-Ray
Materials and interference fields must be researched and made common

of your desktop computer.
Using the same technology, resolution, and methods, BTC Bitcoins are

No doubt the access and decoding to these sigint signals requires
similar proessing before being steered to the digitiser.
