OK, so I'll just add to what's been written so far.
* Most DHTs are indeed intended for a non-hostile environment and allow
users to freely place information in the DHT. This means that data items
can be easily eclipsed from the network by abusing the DHT's principle
of storing an item on the node with the ID that is closest to the item's
own ID. Most concepts support replica.
* The only DHT type that really has seen wide deployment seems to be
Kademlia, most notably in aMule/eMule and some bot networks. Steiner et
al. showed by example that Eclipse attacks against data items are easy
("Conducting and optimizing Eclipse attacks in the Kad P2P network").
* The aMule developers reacted to that attack by restricting routing
tables. Kohen/Leske et al. showed that this can be easily circumvented
by introducing chains of attackers that cooperate in a particular
fashion to redirect queries and let Kad run into a timeout.
* We have been active in Kad research for a little while, too. We found
that while Eclipse attacks against data items are easy, they are much
much harder against active nodes. I.e. Kad is designed to keep
long-running nodes as long in the routing tables as possible, and to
spread this knowledge widely in the network. This makes it very hard for
an attacker to reroute traffic intended for a victim. However, given a
very strong attacker (1000s of nodes), this should become possible
again. It is one of the disruptive DoS methods.
* The most interesting work that I know of is GNUnet: They employ a DHT called R5N that combines recursive Kad-style routing
with an initial random walk to evade the above attacker. GNUnet's
problem is that there are not enough developers to get the network to a
reasonable size, but the underlying technology is interesting. GNUnet
also has a SDSI/SPKI-style DNS replacement called GADS. Christian
Grothoff is the main developer and also at TUM (that's how I know him) -
he recently gave a talk on PRISM and GNUnet:
There is a host of older literature, too - P2P research, however, has
become a cold topic. Although I expect that it will see a revival in the
face of surveillance.

Can you rephrase whether you want info about DHT systems that are
related to some kind of mix system (e.g. GNUnet), or whether you simply
want to know about common DHT systems. If the latter, what kind of
attacks are you after? Eclipse?

Are you talking about the BCP? Then what you say is not true either.
1) General consensus seems to be that recommending DHE-2048 is not a
good idea in the BCP, because it will not be available now, nor in short
to mid-range time. Voices that utter different opinions are currently a
minority; the BCP authors are not among them.
2) Consequently, the BCP effort is currently on deciding whether a ECC
variant of DHE or DHE-1024 should be the recommendation. The factions
seem to be split about equally:
Pro DHE-1024:
* Some say not enough systems provide ECDHE to recommend it, and thus
DHE1024 should be the primary recommendation.
* Some say ECDHE is not trustworthy yet due to implementation
difficulties and/or NSA involvement.
Pro ECDHE:
* Others say Chrome and Firefox will soon, or already do, support ECDHE
it. That would leave only the Windows users on IE, and we know that
Windows 8.1 will support it.
* The same people acknowledge the "trustworthy" argument. The question
is whether it weighs heavily enough.
That seems to be a more accurate description as I understand it from
reading the list. Myself, I am currently still undecided on the issue
but tend slightly towards ECDHE for now -- with any luck, the BCP won't
be ready until we have some more data on the issue.

Very hard to get unless you have a tap into a major MX. Much SMTP
traffic is SSL-secured today (which is a good thing), and thus the
standard monitoring setups, where the monitors sits near the border
router, cannot determine if there is a signature inside the traffic.
The significance of doing local measurements is very disputable.
