I think the theory of 'many eyes makes all bugs shallow' was disproven
long ago, especially when new code is added faster than it can be
properly reviewed. Every time we remove a chunk of code or unroll a
macro, we make new discoveries. The flensing is far from over.
Sounds like the next step is to remove curves <= 193 bits, and learn
from what breaks as a result.
