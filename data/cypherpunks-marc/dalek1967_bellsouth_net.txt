@_subject: Re: [gentoo-user] skype 
I never used Skype, never even seen it run before.  I did read on this
list that it needs version 3 of qt.  If you don't have that installed,
may be worth a try.  I have this installed on mine.  x11-libs/qt-3.3.8-r2
I hope that helps.  Long distance phone calls do suck.  I can't imagine
international calls.
