2. OMB to agencies: Get it right before you put it out
By Jason Peckenpaugh The Office of Management and Budget Wednesday issued its first-ever
guidelines to ensure information delivered by federal agencies-from
census data to weather forecasts-meets standards of quality and
integrity. The OMB guidelines require agencies to make information quality a
performance goal and to develop a review process to ensure the integrity
of information before it is released. Agencies must also develop their
own standards for information quality that conform to OMB's guidelines. Under the guidelines, citizens can ask for corrected versions of any
information that violates these guidelines, but OMB told agencies to
make certain the correction process does not bog down their operations. "Agencies, in making their determination of whether or not to correct
information, may reject claims made in bad faith or without
justification," said John Graham, administrator of the Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs at OMB. Full story:

Protective masks for every House Member and floor staffer were placed in an area readily accessible to lawmakers in the Capitol roughly a year ago to guard against a chemical or germ warfare assault, according to senior House "There were plenty of meetings where this was discussed and it was put in place," a knowledgeable House GOP aide said.
Another House staffer added that masks are available in multiple places within the Capitol building.

    WorldNetDaily Reports WTC Terrorists Used Encryption
    posted by admin on Friday September 21,     There must be something about encryption and terrorists in
    the same graf that makes levelheaded journalists go nutty. Just take a
    compelling -- if only because it's so strange -- article posted
    Thursday on the conservative WorldNetDaily news site. It claims,
    implausibly, that Osama bin Laden "has the NSA beat on the employment
    front, hiring the best computer experts on the market." One allegedly
    is Nabil Khan Kani, a Syrian living in Barcelona. Kani's supposedly
    the author of some data-hiding steganography products that have been
    giving U.S. spies fits. An excerpt: "Computer and terrorism experts
    suggest that the missing Syrian computer whiz was the author of the
    technology known as steganography... This technology enables users to
    bypass electronic monitoring by hiding messages randomly in seemingly
    innocent digital files, such as music files, those of the popular
    online marketplace eBay, pornographic files or even e-mail headers...
    U.S. intelligence has been unable to trace their authors and
    recipients in the three years since first detecting evidence of their
    existence in the files of the bin Laden organization. U.S. agencies
    now believe that the attacks in New York and Washington were
    coordinated through those encrypted electronic messages, which were
    opened by 'key' holders. They also believe that terrorists are in
    possession of all or part of the codes used by the Drug Enforcement
    Administration, the National Reconnaissance Office, Air Force
    Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Naval Intelligence, Marine Corps
    Intelligence and the intelligence offices of the State Department and
    Department of Energy." Watch for Sen. Judd "Anti-Crypto" Gregg to
    cite this report in a floor speech.

    Bedfellows. The Moose is heartened by the national show of unity
    against terrorism. But, beware of strange bedfellows.
    The alliance of right and left wing flotsam and jetsam is nothing new
    on the foreign policy front. We witnessed it during the Kosovo
    conflict when noted hawks such as Lott and DeLay joined the "peace
    now" crowd. With a direct attack on the American homeland, dissident
    voices are muted but have not entirely disappeared.
    The most bizarre example comes from Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson
    who suggested that the attack was God's wrath against a nation that
    has sinned. This was a new theocratic right variant on the "Blame
    American First" theme that used to be the purview of the left. As was
    eloquently stated during the 2000 Republican primaries, Robertson and
    Falwell are truly the "agents of intolerance."
    Meanwhile, a few timid left voices are suggesting that we must look
    for "root causes" for the terrorist behavior. However, the American
    people are not in a receptive audience for the root cause crowd.
    A more pernicious development is an emerging right-left alliance
    against the ability of law enforcement to conduct domestic
    surveillance of terrorists.
    According to the Washington Post, groups ranging from the ACLU to the
    Free Congress Foundation and the Gun Owners of America are uniting to
    "declare their concerns that increased surveillance initiatives would
    invade privacy." One conservative group called the Coalition for
    Constitutional Liberties declared that, "our most basic and
    fundamental freedoms are under attack unlike any time since the
    Revolutionary Era."
    The Moose would find this all so amusing if it weren't so sad. Some on
    the right have long had the constitutional outlook of the ACLU on
    issues ranging from soft money to the drug war.
    Yes, there is a tremendous threat to our security, but it isn't coming
    from the FBI! The unholy alliance of the right and the left is not
    focused on stopping terrorists who threaten our very lives, but rather
    on restraining law enforcement which seeks to protect our safety.
    Privacy is fine, but at a time such as this, we must guard our
    security first. This right-left coalition is just another variant on
    the discredited liberal gang from the 60's which sought to tie the
    hands of the police against criminals.
    Make no mistake, there is a terrorist conspiracy operating within the
    borders of the United States. According to testimony from a federal
    official during congressional hearings last year, "As we know, Middle
    East terrorist groups - such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and Osama bin
    Laden's organization - are using computerized files, email and
    encryption to support their organizations."
    Some so-called conservatives have long opposed allowing law
    enforcement to have encryption-busting powers. Evidently, the largesse
    of the computer industry and other special interests can be very
    influential. The Moose, however, makes no apologies for desiring that
    the FBI has every tool available to thwart the terrorist plans. Give
    Attorney General Ashcroft all he requests, and more.
    If this is war, it is time for both the left and the right to choose
    sides.

Bush Bill Rewrites Spy Laws
    By Declan McCullagh (declan
    2:00 a.m. Sep. 19, 2001 PDT
    WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration will ask for more power to
    eavesdrop on phone calls, the Internet and voicemail messages,
    according to an outline of a bill obtained by Wired News.
    In response to last week's catastrophic terrorist attacks, President
    Bush plans to ask Congress to approve far-reaching legislation that
    rewrites U.S. laws dealing with electronic surveillance, immigration
    and support for terrorists.
    "We will call upon the Congress of the United States to enact these
    important anti-terrorism measures this week," Attorney General John
    Ashcroft said Monday. "We need these tools to fight the terrorism
    threat which exists in the United States, and we must meet that
    growing threat."
    According to the two-page outline -- which lacks key details and could
    change before it's sent to Capitol Hill -- police would be able to
    conduct more wiretaps and use the Carnivore surveillance system in
    more situations without court orders. That section of the bill appears
    to mirror an amendment the Senate approved last Thursday evening.
    No restrictions on encryption products, a prospect feared by some
    civil libertarians, appear in the outline.
    The bill hands prosecutors a courtroom edge, saying that accused
    terrorists should stay in jail by default, that detention of suspected
    terrorists is "mandatory," and that the Immigration and Naturalization
    Service will have more authority to kick immigrants suspected of being
    terrorists out of the United States.

The analysis, such as it is, was superficial. Some kuro5hin articles
are worthwhile and thought-provoking; this, alas, was not in that
Some problems with the article:
First, the bill did not pass "the legislature," just the Senate.
Second, the vote on the amendment was Thursday, not Friday. Third, it
was one session, not multiple "sessions." Fourth, it is hardly
"admirable that in this time of need partisan politics was [sic] put
aside" -- that's precisely what leads to bad legislation. Fifth, the
bill not not "been in the pipeline for two months" -- it was debated
in committee for far longer during hearings early this year. Sixth,
it does not "broadens the definition of wiretaps to mean monitoring of
communications over the Internet" -- Carnivore has already been used
under existing legal authority. Seventh, the constitutional analysis
is wrong -- the broadest protection of privacy found in the BoR is in
the Fourth Amendment, which isn't even mentioned, and which would be
used in a constutional attack on Carnivore.
The conclusion of this so-called analysis:
 "If we grant great powers to men of principle who we have trusted to
 lead us in times of national turmoil, and they don't loose [sic] sight
 of the righteous goal in front of them; then perhaps true good will
 come of this."
When "men of principle" are in the Senate? Leahy, who wrote CALEA?
What's this "righteous goal" -- supporting Bush in carpet-bombing
missions? What "true good" can come of this? What nonsense.
This is not a personal attack on the author, who I don't know and bear
no ill will toward. But if you really find simpleminded commentary
"mature," you're beyond contempt.

Tragedy sparks renewed interest in public service
By Kellie Lunney
Many federal employees who have retired from public service are eager to return to work in the wake of last week's terrorist attacks, according to officials at the Office of Personnel Management. Other agencies, including the CIA and Coast Guard, have also reported a surge in interest among retirees and other people people eager to go to work for the government. "We have been getting a number of phone calls throughout our Employment Service Office from individual retirees interested in coming back to work to help out if they are needed," said Ellen Tunstall, assistant director for employment policy at OPM. Tunstall said OPM did not have specific numbers yet on how many people have offered to return. OPM has set up an e-mail address for federal retirees who are interested in returning to government service. Interested retirees can e-mail OPM at patriot Those interested in applying for jobs with the federal government should refer to the USAJOBS Web site, OPM officials said. Under normal circumstances, re-employed federal retirees are required by law to take a reduction in pay or benefits if they want to return to government employment, but OPM announced last week that it is prepared to give agency heads the authority to grant waivers, and will respond to such requests Full story:

Below is a few rounds of a debate we had on Dave Farber's IP list in response to my article ("Senate votes to permit warrantless Net-wiretaps, Carnivore use"):
I'm glad to see Stu joining the civil libertarian crowd. He's right, of course, that there are reasons to be uneasy about the new "Combating Terrorism Act."
Current law permits specific Justice Department officials to authorize meatspace telephone pen register and trap and trace devices without a court order in two circumstances. Here's an excerpt from the U.S. Code:
This bill does three things of note:
1. It adds "U.S. Attorney" to the list of officials who can authorize warantless surveillance.
2. It expands the "emergency situation" rule beyond serious bodily injury/organized crime. I described this in my article:
3. It rewrites pen register/trap and trace law and moves it from the telephone world to explicitly cover computer networks as well, which would permit Carnivore's use under this section (when operated in trap-and-trace/pen-register mode). Here are some excerpts from the bill:
Now, whether all this is, as Stu blandly suggests, "a bit alarmist," is up to IPers to decide. But I think Senator Patrick Leahy, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee, put it well during the floor debate last night. Here's a quote from the Congressional Record.
         ip-sub-1
         "Baker, Stewart" I ignored the first two points because I don't think they're that important.
These "warrantless searches" are emergency orders that have to be followed
by a court order in 48 hours.  Sometimes courts are closed and the cops need
data right away.  Tuesday evening would be a good example.  This is not some
out-of-control police authority.
The people who can ask for emergency orders have to be designated by one of
several officials at Main Justice.  That's to make sure someone responsible
ends up with the authority to declare an emergency.  So an assistant US
attorney could be designated by Main Justice in each district right now.
What's the big deal with letting the US Attorney for the district do the
designating instead of Main Justice? Seems to me that the US Attorney
probably knows more about staff changeovers than Main Justice, so it makes
sense for the US Attorney to do the designating locally.
Maybe you're right. Maybe this expansion of warrantless surveillance powers is unobjectionable. Maybe the FBI and the state law enforcement agencies that will be able to legally use Carnivore without a court order in some circumstances will prove entirely trustworthy. Maybe they truly do need this power in emergencies. Maybe it'll even stop some terrorists. Maybe you're correct to say, "What's the big deal?"
But let's have that discussion in public, during daylight hours, in a hearing room where reasoned conversation can take place. Let's ask the FBI director and the attorney general to testify, and let's invite representatives from groups like the ACLU, CDT and EPIC to join them. Let's allow senators to ask the bill's sponsors tough questions about what this oddly-written legislation really does. And let's give them as much time as they need to answer.
What we shouldn't do is rush substantial rewrites of wiretapping law through the Senate in the middle of the night, just two days after the worst terrorist attack ever, when the country is in the throes of a national emergency. What we shouldn't do is have the legislation's sponsors

Somehow this just seems really wrong...
3. Frequent flier legislation passes Senate committee By Tanya N. Ballard An amendment to the Defense authorization bill (S. 1155) allowing military personnel and federal workers to keep the frequent flier miles they earn while traveling on the government's dime, was approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee Friday. Senate Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., sponsored the amendment along with Sen. John Warner, R-Va. In August Warner introduced S. 1369, a Senate bill that would have extended the benefit to federal employees. The Defense authorization amendment would allow military personnel, foreign service members, their families and others who travel on official government business to keep their frequent flier miles. "Soldiers, sailors, pilots, and Marines are on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, prepared to go into harm's way," Lieberman explained. "Letting them take advantage of frequent flier programs--which cost the taxpayer absolutely nothing--is a small gesture, but one that can mean a lot for morale." The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-355) prohibits federal employees from accepting promotional items they receive while traveling expense. Those items included frequent flier miles, upgrades and access to carrier clubs or facilities. Full story:

This is nonsense, and shows how seriously we should take the rest of the message. I was at the Pentagon yesterday; the plane did not hit the south side. (Photos at mccullagh.org).
I pulled a transcript from Lexis-Nexis. Here's what Armey said in response to the Pennsylvania question, (AUDIO GAP) in the original:
ARMEY: Well we learned some things about that.  At this point the information
is classified.  It is clear that we to have had a good investigation going
forward.  We are gathering information, there is a (AUDIO GAP) confidentiality
on what we know, but we do know that this is a serious premeditated crime, and I can say without any doubt or hesitation it's an international crime.
Did he 'fess up? I doubt it. Armey is a savvy political operator and gets classified briefings probably once a week or so. It's unlikely he'd cough up confidential material now (he hasn't before) -- it was ~12 hours after the attack happened, so he had time to reflect and digest it.

Congress Mulls Stiff Crypto Laws
    By Declan McCullagh (declan
    1:45 p.m. Sep. 13, 2001 PDT
    WASHINGTON -- The encryption wars have begun.
    For nearly a decade, privacy mavens have been worrying that a
    terrorist attack could prompt Congress to ban
    communications-scrambling products that frustrate both police wiretaps
    and U.S. intelligence agencies.
    Tuesday's catastrophe, which shed more blood on American soil than any
    event since the Civil War, appears to have started that process.
    Some politicians and defense hawks are warning that extremists such as
    Osama bin Laden, who U.S. officials say is a crypto-aficionado and the
    top suspect in Tuesday's attacks, enjoy unfettered access to
    privacy-protecting software and hardware that render their
    communications unintelligible to eavesdroppers.
    In a floor speech on Thursday, Sen. Judd Gregg (R-New Hampshire)
    called for a global prohibition on encryption products without
    backdoors for government surveillance.
    "This is something that we need international cooperation on and we
    need to have movement on in order to get the information that allows
    us to anticipate and prevent what occurred in New York and in
    Washington," Gregg said, according to a copy of his remarks that an
    aide provided.
    President Clinton appointed an ambassador-rank official, David Aaron,
    to try this approach, but eventually the administration abandoned the
    project.
    Gregg said encryption makers "have as much at risk as we have at risk
    as a nation, and they should understand that as a matter of
    citizenship, they have an obligation" to include decryption methods
    for government agents. Gregg, who previously headed the appropriations
    subcommittee overseeing the Justice Department, said that such access
    would only take place with "court oversight."

    Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy, a hawkish think tank
    that has won accolades from all recent Republican presidents, says

    "I'm certainly of the view that we need to let the U.S. government
    have access to encrypted material under appropriate circumstances and
    regulations," says Gaffney, an assistant secretary of defense under

I recognize that you may be going through a lot of mail, but the article is hardly "seriously misleading."
I made precisely the point you made myself (it doesn't appear that you read the article in its entirety, and based your comments on a brief excerpt):
Pardon me for not taking much comfort from your assurance that Carnivore and its progeny can be used "only in its pen register mode." The URLs to web pages I visit, which can include search terms, and the identities of the people with whom I correspond, are important items that many people would consider private enough to require a court order.
Also, as a seperate note, Senate Judiciary committee aides told me they believe the wording of the bill -- apparently hastily-drafted -- may cover content of the communications, not just origin-desination information. If they're not sure, and they've had a full day to read it, how can you be so remarkably positive your interpretation is correct?
And even if you think it's unobjectionable, these sorts of measures might well deserve full, reasoned debate rather than being rushed through late in the night during a national emergency, two days after a brutal terrorist attack, and attached to a spending bill. (The spending bill doesn't even take effect for weeks, so clearly we could wait until next week and, gasp, convene a hearing.) Senators were given just half an hour or so to read a complicated wiretap bill before a scheduled vote.
Senator Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Judiciary committee and is not known for exaggerating privacy threats, was concerned enough to denounce the bill on the Senate floor during the late-night debate. Here's what he said:
We can disagree about how concerned we should be about broader warantless surveillance powers -- one DC privacy group has already said this bill is the most disturbing change to wiretap laws since CALEA -- but dismissing concerns as "only pen register mode" seems a bit much.

In response to the Attack on America, I have drawn upon my extensive work in
secure banking systems, key escrow systems, and patent licensing to bring
you the following white paper (about 10 pages of text).
Frank W. Sudia, JD, "Encryption and the Restoration of National Sovereignty:
Proposal for an Escrow Patent Pool Corporation," September 14, 2001.
     While at Bankers Trust (1991-98) I designed one of the largest encryption
systems in the world, the Global Trust Organization.  Chartered in 1999 as
Identrus LLC ( it now includes 50 of the world's largest
In my view, encryption policy options are poorly understood.  The power of
government to protect the nation should not be in doubt, yet the debate has
been skewed by the claims of opponents that such systems will not or cannot
In reality, it would be straightforward to build a system that is much more
secure than the current banking system.  However, this has not been done,
and cannot be done, because complex patent problems must be resolved.
Before anything serious and believable can ever be built, even on a test
basis, we must aggregate the required patents into product pools, using
government money and eminent domain powers, if necessary.  And we must fund
the development of prototypes.  Only after viability has been established
can the commercial sector move forward with products that are highly secure
and credible.
For further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.  If you are a
contact or friend of mine, I would appreciate comments, which will be
acknowledged in any future version.

I hope, in light of this terrible tragedy, that Dan Gillmor will cease his whining about personal privacy and recognize that our national security and the safety of our citizens override his concern about privacy, ``We have been tested before and survived: Don't let criminals shut down our freedoms'' (Aug. 12). The government absolutely must have the ability to monitor all encrypted messages, and anyone sending or receiving encrypted messages on our soil that cannot be decoded by the appropriate federal agency must be subject to arrest and seizure of the encryption equipment. We are at war, and we all, including Gillmor, need to recognize that.

Depends on whether you believe politicotalk or not. Gregg's comments
were heartfelt, IMHO. Sad that the only principles politicos seem to have
nowadays is the principle of limiting crypto, privacy.
Maybe. Then again, this would have been the time to do it, in this bill.
The fine print will bear reading.
Also, keep an eye out for Sen. Kyl, who complained about crypto last week.

Attorney General Remarks
Press Briefing
FBI headquarters
September 17, 2001
ATTY GEN. ASHCROFT: While the investigation is ongoing and still moving forward vigorously, we are beginning to learn
more about the attack last Tuesday and the plot to make it happen.
      As we have said before, we do believe that there are associates of the hijackers that have connections to terrorist
organizations that may still be in the United States. The tips we have received and the leads developed in the FBI field offices
have been extremely helpful in helping us assemble a list of individuals that might have information about these associates, or, in
fact, be among the associates. We are looking at the possibility that there may have been more than four planes targeted for
hijacking. But we are not able at this time to confirm that.
      To date the FBI has received more than 96,000 tips and potential leads: more than 54,000 on the website, nearly 9,000 on
the hot line, the toll_free WATTS line, and more than 33,000 leads that were generated in the FBI field offices. Obviously there
is still a great deal of information to be collected in order to understand the full picture of how last Tuesday's attack was
planned and the full extent of damage that the terrorists intended to cause is understood.
      Our effort includes talking to the numbers of people that may have information related to the case. That's why we have
forwarded a list of more than 190 people to national, state and local law enforcement agencies across the country and other
organizations that could be helpful in this effort, organizations like the airlines. We also have a responsibility to use every legal
means at our disposal to prevent further terrorist activity by taking people into custody who have violated the law and who may
pose a threat to America.
      The details that we have learned in the enormous destruction and devastation that was caused by last Tuesday's attack have
brought us to a turning point in our country's fight against terrorism and the preservation of the safety and security of our
society. On that morning last Tuesday the forces of terrorism attacked the citizens of our country with a ferocity that was
nothing short of a declaration of war against the people of America. The President of the United States has announced that we
will meet that declaration with a full commitment of resources and with a firm resolve to rid the world of terrorism.
      The fight against terrorism must be an overriding priority of the Department of Justice. I have talked this week about
possible legislative changes that we would need in order to be able to fight effectively against terrorism. And I'm pleased with
the cooperation from members of Congress and their ideas, their comments, their suggestions and their support for a package
which we would hope to have ready in the next few days. But this new effort requires more than just legislation.
      There are actions the Department of Justice can take now on its own to make sure the prevention of terrorism is a high
priority. That's why last night at my direction Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Jim Ziglar signed an
administrative revision to the current INS regulations regarding the detention of aliens. The regulation previously allowed the
Immigration and Naturalization Service only 24 hours in which to decide whether to charge an alien that had been taken into
custody because of a violation. The revision announced last night expands the 24_hour time period to 48 hours, or to an
additional reasonable time if necessary under an emergency or in other extraordinary circumstances. This rule change will apply
to the 75 individuals who are currently detained by the INS on immigration violations that may also have information related to
this investigation.
      In addition, every United States attorney's office has reviewed the office's resources and structure in light of the growing
threat of terrorism. As a part of the new counterterrorism strategy, every United States attorney and every district of such an
attorney that hasn't already done so has been asked to establish an antiterrorism task force. At my direction last week, each
U.S. attorney's office identified an experienced prosecutor who will serve as the antiterrorism coordinator for that district. That
coordinator is to convene a meeting of representatives from the federal law enforcement agencies, and that would be the FBI,
the INS, the DEA, the Marshals Service, Customs, Secret Service, the ATF, or Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms.
      Together with those federal officials there would be the invitation to primary state and local police forces in that district. That
group, headed by the U.S. attorney, would be the antiterrorism task force in that U.S. attorney's district. These task forces will
be a part of a national network that will coordinate the dissemination of information and the development of a strategy to
disrupt, dismantle and punish terrorist organizations throughout the country.
      First, the task forces will serve as a conduit for information about suspected terrorists between federal and local agencies,
so that local police forces can be part and parcel of an effort to prevent terrorist attacks by having access to the information
available to federal agencies. Intelligence about terrorist networks obtained by federal agencies will be disseminated through
these task forces to the local police officials who can help monitor any terrorist network in their locality. Also, intelligence
developed by local police will be conveyed through this collaboration to the federal agencies. This information highway will not
be a one_way street.
      Second, the antiterrorism task force in each district will serve as a coordinating body for implementing the operational plan
for the prevention of terrorism. Once substantial credible information is received indicating that individuals or groups in a
particular district may be terrorists or abetting terrorism or aiding terrorism, the members of the antiterrorism task force in
conjunction with the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice will determine and implement the most effective strategy for
incapacitating any terrorist activity on their part.
      Third, the antiterrorism task force in each district will serve as a standing organizational structure for a coordinated response
to any terrorist incident in that district.
      In sum, the implementation of the task force coordinated by the U.S. attorney in each district, working with the FBI, will
provide the operational foundation for a concerted national assault against terrorism. This system will provide law enforcement
with a comprehensive, seamless approach to attack terrorism within our       Now, I understand that this is an aggressive and an ambitious agenda, that it represents a more preventative approach to
doing business in the U.S. attorney's offices together with the FBI than perhaps has been the case in the past. We must all
recognize that our mission has changed. It has been changed by the events of this last week.
      The threat that seemed fairly remote to most Americans seven days ago is now felt in every heart and every home in the
United States. And if we are to dispel this threat, we must meet it with ingenuity and with determination. I want to thank all of
the hard_working individuals in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and all of the United States attorneys across the country,
and state and local law enforcement officials who have joined together with us for their quick action in this important mission.
Let me just address you on another matter that I think may be of concern to       As you all may be aware, a new Internet infection designed NIMDA __ some people say that's "ADMIN" backwards __ it
is, but I'm not sure if that's consequential __ was noted this morning. It may have started as early as yesterday, and it infects
computers on the Internet worldwide. The computers that are infected then scan the Internet in search of other computers. And
this very substantially expands the traffic load on the Internet. The scanning activity thus far indicates that this could be heavier
than the July activity with Code Red. Our government together with the private sector __ which is, incidentally, a very strong
and powerful partnership when we work together __ is assessing the problem. And we'll try and provide more information from
the FBI to you about this later today.
      In the meantime, I'm pleased to say that I understand that most of the antivirus companies have posted the files needed to
protect unprotected computers, and those files obviously are available at this time.
      There is no evidence at this time which links this infection to the terrorist attacks of last week.
      Thank you very much.
      Q What evidence is there, Mr. Attorney General, at this point that might connect this case to the Iraq government? And
secondly, has the FBI scuttled any other planned attacks that you're aware of?
      ATTY GEN. ASHCROFT: Let me take those in inverse order, if you will. Obviously, as the FBI and other law
enforcement agencies elevate their security, we would hope if there were other attacks in the making, that those would be
deterred. And that's the reason we are asking people around the country to not only work, but to watch, and law enforcement
and security agencies to elevate their concerns.
      I wouldn't be in a position to discuss evidence in regard to questions about other responsible parties.
      Q Two weeks ago __ a few weeks ago, I should say, the FBI questioned flight schools in Minnesota and in Oklahoma about
a man who we now know is in custody because of suspicions about his flight training requests. Did the FBI or any federal
officials warn airlines or FAA to be on the watch for this individual? And if not, why not?
      ATTY GEN. ASHCROFT: I'm not able to make a comment on that.
      Yes, ma'am.
      Q Mr. Ashcroft, earlier this year, you had a series of meeting with a bipartisan group from Congress in an effort to try and
repeal the use of secret evidence, evidence that is not shared with the defendants, so_called classified information. Courts have
repeatedly struck down the use of secret evidence against possible criminal aliens. You also had assured Congress a while
back that to the best of your knowledge, secret evidence is not being used by this administration against possible criminal aliens,
including alleged terrorists, and that you would not use secret evidence until Congress decided what to do. Given the situation,
will that change you opinion and also Congress' move, which I thought was imminent this month, to try and repeal the use of
secret evidence?
      ATTY GEN. ASHCROFT: Well, your question brings us really to a point about the extent to which we will respect the
constitutional rights of individuals. And we will not yield in our determination to protect the constitutional rights of individuals.
Very frankly, those who attack the United States would attack the constitutional rights as well as the safety of individuals.
      We're going to do everything we can to harmonize the constitutional rights of individuals with every legal capacity we can
muster to also protect the safety and security of individuals.
      It's with that in mind that we would evaluate any potential changes in the law.
      Yes?
      Q Are any of the 71 being held __
      Q (Inaudible) __ system to track visa over_stays? No one even knows how many people are in the U.S. now without a visa.
      ATTY GEN. ASHCROFT: Would you want to repeat that question?
      Q No one would ever have found these people if there hadn't been a catastrophe, because there's no way to track people
who are out of status or whatever way you want to call it.
      ATTY GEN. ASHCROFT: The president of the United States recognized a very broad set of deficiencies in our
Immigration and Naturalization services that related to very many people out of status, and suggested and has called for a
reformation in INS. Plans to make the Immigration and Naturalization Service a better service agency and a better enforcement
agency are under way. And I can only hope that when we do that, it will result in an elevated capacity to secure the safety of
the American people.
      Yes, sir?
      Q General Ashcroft __ (off mike) __ information that there were more than five planes or six planes? You said you're unable
to confirm it.
      ATTY GEN. ASHCROFT: We are unable to confirm that there are additional planes, but we have not ruled that out in our
evaluation. And we are pursuing an examination and investigative potentials that might help us be more certain about that
particular matter.
      Yes?
      Q Are you assuming wartime powers?
      Q (Inaudible) __ possible tips, how is it possible to check all of them? And how many are actually proving to be helpful?
      ATTY GEN. ASHCROFT: (Chuckles.) Well, that's a very good question. Obviously, many of them are redundant and
many of them are mutually exclusive. And so we sort through them as best we can. We try to prioritize them. And pursuing an
investigation like this is a little bit like selling insurance; it doesn't matter how many bad ones you get, it's a matter of how many
times you finally find a situation where the answer is yes, and you pursue it. When we get to a good lead, then we follow it.
      Q Are any of (these suspects ?) considered prisoners of war? Are you assuming wartime powers in any way?
      ATTY GEN. ASHCROFT: No.
      Thank you.

Text of the "Mobilization Against Terrorism Act":
    Text of President Bush's Anti-Terrorism Bill Now Online
    posted by declan on Wednesday September 19,     from the be-sure-to-read-the-fine-print dept.
    For the last week, Washington has been buzzing about what may
    -- or may not -- be in the "Mobilization Against Terrorism Act." We
    now have a draft copy of MATA online that you can find at
     or
     (Alas, it's in a series of JPG
    files, but if someone wants to take the large version and OCR it,
    please post a link in the comment thread below.) The Bush
    administration sent a draft of MATA to Congress late Wednesday, with
    the House Judiciary committee pledging "a legislative hearing followed
    by a full committee markup as soon as possible" once they receive the
    final version. We'll let you look through the bill yourself, but note
    how this would expand the utility of the Net's two favorite
    surveillance systems: Carnivore and Echelon. If you want to crib from
    a summary, see the outline we posted on Tuesday. EFF's press release
    on MATA is attached below.

DOJ's Anti-Terrorism Law Would Dismantle Civil Liberties
Legislate to Improve Security Not Eliminate Freedoms
San Francisco, California - The Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF) today criticized the "Mobilization Against
Terrorism Act" proposed by the US Department of Justice
because many provisions of the law would dramatically alter
the civil liberties landscape through unnecessarily broad
restrictions on free speech and privacy rights in the
United States and abroad.
EFF again urged Congress to act with deliberation in
approving only measures that are effective in preventing
terrorism while protecting the freedoms of Americans.
Attorney General John Ashcroft distributed the proposed
Mobilization Against Terrorism Act to members of
Congress after Monday's press conference at which he
indicated that, among other measures, he would ask
Congress to expand the ability of law enforcement officers
to perform wiretaps in response to the terrorist attacks
on the United States on September 11, 2001. Ashcroft
asked Congress to pass anti-terrorism legislation
including "expanded electronic surveillance" by the end of
this week.
EFF believes this broad legislation would radically tip the
United States system of checks and balances, giving the
government unprecedented authority to surveil American
citizens with little judicial or other oversight.
One particularly egregious section of the DOJ's analysis of
its proposed legislation says that "United States
prosecutors may use against American citizens information
collected by a foreign government even if the collection
would have violated the Fourth Amendment."
"Operating from abroad, foreign governments will do the
dirty work of spying on the communications of Americans
worldwide. US protections against unreasonable search and
seizure won't matter," commented EFF Senior Staff Attorney
Lee Tien.
Additional provisions of the proposed Mobilization Against
Terrorism Act include measures which:
* Make it possible to obtain e-mail message header
information and Internet user web browsing patterns without
a wiretap order
* Eviscerate controls on roving wiretaps
* Permit law enforcement to disclose information obtained
through wiretaps to any employee of the Executive branch
* Reduce restrictions on domestic investigations under the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)
* Permit grand juries to provide information to the US
intelligence community
* Permit the President to designate any "foreign-directed
individual, group, or entity," including any United States
citizen or organization, as a target for FISA
* Prevent people from even talking about terrorist acts
* Establish a DNA database for every person convicted of
any felony or certain sex offenses, almost all of which
are entirely unrelated to terrorism
EFF Executive Director Shari Steele emphasized, "While it
is obviously of vital national importance to respond
effectively to terrorism, this bill recalls the McCarthy
era in the power it would give the government to
scrutinize the private lives of American citizens."
Ashcroft's proposed legislation comes in the wake of the
Senate's hasty passage of the "Combating Terrorism Act"
on the evening of September 13 with less than 30 minutes
of consideration on the Senate floor.

Some brief thoughts in response:
* It's not just getting hit by an attack that we citydwellers may need to worry about, but the disruption afterward. It seems, based on news reports, that many thousands of New Yorkers were left without basic water-gas-electricity-phone service after last week's attacks. Water, food, warm clothes -- lucky it wasn't winter -- can be vital. Better than a Red Cross handout shelter.
* Folks in DC are starting to think through this. My intern told me today he has a gas mask (not new, he's had it a while). It's sorta a nervous joke

There's an entertaining aside that happened in Hawaii during WWII
during a conflict between civilian and military law. The US Marshals,
on behalf of the civil courts, tried to serve a military commander
with a subpoena. The officer ordered troops to block the marshal from
walking onto the porch, while he escaped through a side exit to a
waiting car.

The FBI is responsible for counterterrorism efforts in the U.S. They
have received billions in this area, one of the most rapidly-growing
in their budgets. They have failed miserably. It makese sense, as I said
in a BBC interview last week, not to hold them in "disdain," but not to whitewash their failure either.
That said, it's hardly unreasonable for Americans to help the FBI
(a flight school instructor who recognizes the names of some of his
former students in the media might well want to phone the FBI). But
cypherpunks can't be blamed for being critical of the FBI's counterrorist efforts so far.

A relative of mine works in midtown Manhattan and lives in the
city. He has a 20 minute subway commute each morning, which is what I
had when I worked at Time and other jobs in downtown DC. Perfectly
reasonable, by city standards.
A friend emailed me this yesterday:

I spoke with a cpunk today on the phone, who told me that one of the
two tunnels (Lincoln or Hudson, don't remember which) connecting
Manhattan with the rest of the world to the west was still closed to
all but emergency vehicles. That leaves one tunnel and the GW bridge
to the west, with the Brooklyn bridge closed to the east. Couple that
with serious car searches and the resulting delays, and you've got a
very good reason to move far away.
In DC, things aren't that bad. Road closings near the Pentagon (I-395)
have snarled traffic in the area and led to Metro opening at 4:30 am
to get people to work on time. But coming in and out of the city
through other routes outside of rush hour, which I've done twice this
week, is same as usual.

So-called "toxic molds" infest porous building materials like wood and drywall inside homes and other buildings. The molds release poisonous mycotoxins that can have grave health effects, especially on children, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. Experts say that remediation is often difficult, hazardous and expensive. Health effects can be permanent.

    Dems Ready Bioterrorism Bill
    By Declan McCullagh and Ben Polen
    2:00 a.m. Oct. 26, 2001 PDT
    WASHINGTON -- In an attempt to differentiate themselves from their GOP
    counterparts, House Democrats are preparing legislation they say will
    shield America from biological terrorism.
    As anxieties about anthrax mushroomed on Capitol Hill -- with the
    deadly bacteria discovered in five congressional office buildings so
    far -- House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Missouri) said
    Thursday that new spending and police powers are necessary to protect
    the public.
    At a press conference held in the open air away from any of the
    polluted buildings, Gephardt said his "Bioterrorism Protection Act"
    would earmark $7 billion for homeland security -- including $1.4
    billion on vaccines and antibiotics -- and provide police with instant
    access to private databases such as the airline's SABRE system and
    Amtrak reservations.
    [...]
HOMELAND SECURITY TASK FORCE CHAIRMAN MENENDEZ ANNOUNCES BIOTERRORISM WASHINGTON, DC - Rep. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Vice Chair of the Democratic Caucus and Chairman of the House Democratic Task Force on Homeland Security, joined by Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt and Members of the Task Force, today announced the Democratic proposal to protect communities throughout America against future bioterrorist threats or attacks.
The Democratic Bill, the Bioterrorism Protection Act (BioPAct) of 2001, seeks to eliminate biological threats, secure our borders on land and at sea, protect our food and water, equip our communities with the resources to prevent and respond to bioterrorism, and strengthen our Intelligence through full coordination, using our most advanced technology to fight Menendez made the following remarks:
"I'm Bob Menendez, the Chairman of the House Democratic Task Force on Homeland Security, and I first want to thank the chairs and vice chairs of the working groups that helped write this plan: Bill Pascrell, Sanford Bishop, Bobby Scott, Jane Harman, Ike Skelton, Bob Borski, Lucille Roybal-Allard, Ellen Tauscher, Sheila Jackson-Lee, Mike Honda, Jim Turner, and Jerry Costello - and I want to thank the incredible work of over 80 Members of our Task Force on this bill. These aren't just Members of Congress, they're husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, working to make our country and their communities safe and secure. And I think they've done a great job.
"What we've learned in the last few weeks is that no matter what we as a people are confronted with, we will overcome and defeat our adversaries. No attack, no threat, no evil will undermine our resolve and our strength. America stands proud and firm - our country and our people have served as an example to all of humanity. America has reacted to this unspeakable inhumanity with resiliency & humanity - humanity in the face of evil.
"We call the Bioterrorism Protection Act "BioPAct" because we know that every American needs to be a part of the fight, part of a pact to protect our Homeland. And if we're asking the public to be 'vigilant', then they need and deserve to be informed in full and given the chance to be a part of a dialogue with the officials who work for them. This bill does that.
(more) "BioPAct is a pact between the American people and their government, working together, called to national service, marshaling our vast resources, to keep America safe from bioterrorism. The plan doesn't just draw on government programs, but on the American spirit, intellect & creativity, breaking new frontiers, setting an example the world can follow in this new age.
"We're here to tell our fellow citizens that we can beat this foe - and we can protect our Homeland.
"The BioPAct will proactively assess the new threats and risks we face, so we make sure we target our funding where it's needed most. It will eliminate biological threats at the source, by helping countries like Russia and the other former Soviet states prevent their biological agents from getting into our enemies' hands. We will secure our borders on land and at sea by adding thousands of new border agents and by putting our most advanced technology at work to screen out terrorists and the weapons they might try to bring with them - whether they try to enter our nation at airports, on ships, by foot, or in a car. And BioPAct will keep our food and water supply safe and secure by putting a comprehensive new inspection protocol in place.
"We will make sure our local communities have all the resources they need - from greater hospital capacity, to police and firefighters trained in "We can prevent disease outbreaks through early and rapid detection; and can save lives by making sure we have the vaccines and medicines to treat people - and a plan in place to get them where they need to go on a moment's notice. This bill does that. And BioPAct strengthens our Intelligence by ensuring our many government agencies coordinate information and planning. We need one comprehensive strategy - not a dozen different ones.
"This bill is a commitment to do all this, and a lot more - because we know there is nothing more important than keeping American families safe.
"This is the first in a series of proposals this Task Force and we Democrats in the House are putting forward to address Homeland Security. My colleagues and I look forward to working with the President and the Republicans to get the job done - in fact we met with Director Ridge yesterday, and I'm confident we can work together as one American team.
"And as part of that team effort, we also call on the President to use the funding already allocated to fight terrorism to begin a national threat assessment; to help local communities cover the unexpected overtime costs they have already borne in response to the new threat environment since September 11th; and to rapidly dedicate new resources to our Coast Guard, our border security, and our postal service. We can and will protect our "I'm now proud to introduce our Democratic Leader, Dick Gephardt, who had the foresight early on to work with our Caucus Chairman, Martin Frost, to create this Task Force - bringing so many Members together to work on an issue that's on the mind of every American. He's been an inspiration to this Congress and to our nation - Ladies and Gentlemen: Dick Gephardt -
"Thank you."

X-URL: X-URL: Politech is at User-Agent: Mutt/1.2.2i
Text of USA Act, which President Bush will sign today:
   Terror Bill Has Lasting Effects
   By Declan McCullagh (declan
   2:00 a.m. Oct. 26, 2001 PDT
   WASHINGTON -- Legislators who sent a sweeping anti-terrorism bill to
   President Bush this week proudly say that the most controversial
   surveillance sections will expire in 2005.
   Senate Judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) said that a
   four-year expiration date "will be crucial in making sure that these
   new law enforcement powers are not abused." In the House, Bob Barr
   (R-Georgia) stressed that "we take very seriously the sunset
   provisions in this bill."
   But the Dec. 2005 expiration date embedded in the USA Act -- which the
   Senate approved 98 to 1 on Thursday -- applies only to a tiny part of
   the mammoth bill.
   After the president signs the measure on Friday, police will have the
   permanent ability to conduct Internet surveillance without a court
   order in some circumstances, secretly search homes and offices without
   notifying the owner, and share confidential grand jury information
   with the CIA.
   Also exempt from the expiration date are investigations underway by
   Dec. 2005, and any future investigations of crimes that took place
   before that date.
   [...]
   Other sections of the USA Act, which the House approved by a 357 to 66
   vote on Wednesday, that do not expire include the following:
     * Police can sneak into someone's house or office, search the
       contents, and leave without ever telling the owner. This would be
       supervised by a court, and the notification of the surreptitious
       search "may be delayed" indefinitely. (Section 213)
     * Any U.S. attorney or state attorney general can order the
       installation of the FBI's Carnivore surveillance system and record
       addresses of Web pages visited and e-mail correspondents --
       without going to a judge. Previously, there were stiffer legal
       restrictions on Carnivore and other Internet surveillance
       techniques. (Section 216)
     * Any American "with intent to defraud" who scans in an image of a
       foreign currency note or e-mails or transmits such an image will
       go to jail for up to 20 years. (Section 375)
     * An accused terrorist who is a foreign citizen and who cannot be
       deported can be held for an unspecified series of "periods of up
       to six months" with the attorney general's approval. (Section 412)
     * Biometric technology, such as fingerprint readers or iris
       scanners, will become part of an "integrated entry and exit data
       system" with the identities of visa holders who hope to enter the
       U.S. (Section 414)
     * Any Internet provider or telephone company must turn over customer
       information, including phone numbers called -- no court order
       required -- if the FBI claims the "records sought are relevant to
       an authorized investigation to protect against international
       terrorism." The company contacted may not "disclose to any person"
       that the FBI is doing an investigation. (Section 505)
     * Credit reporting firms like Equifax must disclose to the FBI any
       information that agents request in connection with a terrorist
       investigation -- without police needing to seek a court order
       first. Current law permits this only in espionage cases. (Section
       505)
     * The current definition of terrorism is radically expanded to
       include biochemical attacks and computer hacking. Some current
       computer crimes -- such as hacking a U.S. government system or
       breaking into and damaging any Internet-connected computer -- are
       covered. (Section 808)
     * A new crime of "cyberterrorism" is added, which covers hacking
       attempts causing damage "aggregating at least $5,000 in value" in
       one year, any damage to medical equipment or "physical injury to
       any person." Prison terms range between five and 20 years.
       (Section 814)
     * New computer forensics labs will be created to inspect "seized or
       intercepted computer evidence relating to criminal activity
       (including cyberterrorism)" and to train federal agents. (Section
       816)

There may be limited reasons to keep an honest-to-goodness terrorist
under surveillance, but the new law won't help there -- the FBI already
has the power it needs.

10.  Pentagon under pressure to delay or divide Joint Strike Fighter contract
By Brody Mullins, CongressDaily
Supporters of the Boeing Co., bracing for yet another big loss, are pressuring the Pentagon to delay or divvy up a massive new contract for next-generation fighter jets to replace the military's existing wing of Allies of the aerospace giant fear that granting rival Lockheed Martin Corp. the entire $200 billion joint strike fighter contract would deal a devastating blow to Boeing, even as its commercial aircraft business continues to reel from last month's terrorist attacks.
Republican Sen. Christopher (Kit) Bond and Democratic Sen. Jean Carnahan, both of Missouri, back a proposal to force the Pentagon to award the loser of the fighter jet contract with one- third of the project's manufacturing.

FORMER INS GUARD AT FEDERAL DETENTION FACILITY
PLEADS GUILTY TO SEXUAL ACT WITH FEMALE DETAINEE MIAMI, FL. --
The Public Integrity Section of the Justice Department announced today that Clarence Parker, a former guard at the Krome Service Processing Center (Krome) in Miami, Florida, pled guilty today to knowingly engaging in, and attempting to engage in a sexual act with a female detainee at Krome in October 2000.  "As soon as we learned of the possible actions of this individual, we immediately removed him from Krome," said INS Acting District Director John M. Bulger. "The investigation went forward with our full support.  Our commitment to removing and prosecuting anyone who commits these types of acts is stronger than ever." For the past three years, Parker was a contract employee with the Immigration and Naturalization Service at Krome.  Parker was assigned to the attorney visiting area where he monitored the detainees who were waiting to visit with their attorneys.  As a result of the investigation, Parker was suspended in June 2001. Parker's plea was accepted by the Honorable Federico A. Moreno, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida.  His sentencing for the conviction is scheduled for
December 20, 2001.  This matter is being handled by Trial Attorney Scott Dahl of the Public Integrity Section.  The investigation is being conducted by Department's Office of Inspector General in Ft. Lauderdale and by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Miami Office.   01-551

   WASHINGTON -- Malicious hackers, look out.
   A government anti-terrorism commission will recommend that Congress
   create a shadowy court to oversee investigations of suspected computer
   intruders.
   Gov. James Gilmore (R-Virginia), the commission's chairman, said
   Wednesday that federal judges have been far too sluggish in approving
   search warrants and eavesdropping of online miscreants.
   Instead, Gilmore told the House Science committee, the commission will
   recommend that a "cyber court" be created with extraordinary powers to
   authorize electronic surveillance and secret searches of suspected
   hackers' homes and offices.
   Police investigations are currently hamstrung by a lack of "effective
   procedures and understanding by many in the judiciary concerning the
   nature and urgency of cyber security," Gilmore said.
   [...]
   Gilmore offered few details on the proposal to create a hacker-court.

Legislation Passes House with Bipartisan Majority
        WASHINGTON, D.C. -- U.S. Representative Bob Barr (GA-7), a
senior Member of the House Judiciary Committee, today issued the
following statement after supporting House passage of a comprehensive
anti-terrorism bill, which contains a five-year sunset provision.
        "I supported the anti-terrorism legislation today, not because
I thought it to be a perfect bill or that it may have prevented the
attacks of September 11th.  Rather, I supported the legislation
because it is a necessary step to take at this time,and it is an
appropriate compromise reached between many competing interests.  I'm
not happy with every provision in the bill, nor will I relent in my
defense of our civil liberties in the coming days, but this represents
a meaningful step to prevent future terrorist attacks.  As America
sets-out to find those responsible for the acts of war perpetrated on
us, my determination to accomplish this goal will be matched only by
my continued determination to protect the Bill of Rights."
Barr, a former federal prosecutor, represents Georgia's Seventh
District.  He serves on the House Financial Services, Judiciary, and
Government Reform Committees.

Here's what's happening right now (turn on CSPAN):
1. The House Judiciary committee approved the "PATRIOT Act" 36-0, with a two-year expiration date for wiretapping:
2. The Senate voted last night 96-1 for the USA Act without Sen. Feingold's privacy amendments:
3. The House Rules committee met early this morning to set a rule that specified what bill would go to the floor:
4. According to the speaker's office, the bill is the "base Senate text" of the USA Act with five or six changes that Rep. Conyers had wanted. One of those is that the wiretap sections expire in December 2004 -- unless the president decides it is in the "national interest" to continue them, which would expire them in December 2006.
4. The House voted 211-205 midday today (along party lines) on a preliminary procedural step allowing the bill to be considered.
5. Now they're about to vote on the rule. The rule does not allow amendments, just provides for an up-or-down vote on the USA Act v2.0. CSPAN is carrying this debate.
5. When the House approves the USA Act v2.0 -- I say "when" because I think it's very likely -- it'll be sent back to the Senate for approval. Because the changes (besides the expiration date) are minor, the Senate may vote for it unchanged and send it to the president, something Rep. Senenbrenner predicts will happen.
6. That means no conference committee is necessary.
7. You can find the USA Act v2.0 here:

...
   Civil liberties groups have split over how to react to the impending
   vote on the most important wiretapping and eavesdropping bill in a
   generation.
   The American Civil Liberties Union has taken a hard-line approach,
   asking its members to reject the entire bill. An alert calls the USA
   Act "a bill that would significantly undermine many of the freedoms
   that Americans hold dear."
   The Electronic Frontier Foundation of San Francisco has taken a
   similar position, saying that "Sen. Feingold is expected to offer some
   amendments, but they will not address all of the concerns with this
   legislation."
   Feingold's amendments rewrite only a tiny portion of the vast bill.
   Even with them, the USA Act would still allow police to conduct
   Internet eavesdropping without a court order in some circumstances,
   allow federal prosecutors to imprison non-citizens indefinitely, and
   extend the duration of an electronic surveillance order issued by a
   secret court from 90 to 120 days.
   The Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology is taking a
   noticeably milder approach.
   CDT is not urging the activists who populate its e-mail alert lists to
   tell their senators to oppose the USA Act. Instead, in an alert dated
   late Wednesday, CDT says: "Call your senators in Washington right away
   and let them know that you think civil liberties should be part of the
   balance as we move forward to protect our country from terrorism. Urge
   them to support the Feingold privacy amendments."

Tim knows all about this, of course, but for the benefit of the folks who may not, here's an excerpt from an article I co-authored a few years ago.
With the end of the cold war, it would have made sense for the U.S. military to shrink. Retired Army chief of staff Edward Meyer told a Washington Post reporter in 1989 that "the end of the cold war makes it inevitable that the Army will shrink far below the 772,000 on duty today."
It didn't. Supporters of an expansive U.S. military have spent the last decade finding something for it to do. In the 1980s, Congress amended the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878  which restricts the use of troops to enforce civilian laws  to let the president enlist the military in the War on Drugs. President Reagan in 1986 signed a national security decision directive declaring drug trafficking a threat to the security of the United The framers of the Constitution opposed standing armies in general, and especially their use for any purpose other than defending the country against foreign enemies. It was the arrest of civilians by the British army, quartering of soldiers in private homes, and similarly incendiary tactics that provided the tinder that sparked the American Revolution.
Less than a century later, President Lincoln usurped constitutional authority in well-chronicled ways. His justification: The inherent power of the commander-in-chief and his duty to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully Executed." During the Civil War and Reconstruction, the arrest and trial of civilians by military and civilian courts  and the impotence of civilian courts when the military refused to respect orders of habeas corpus  led to the passage of the Posse Comitatus Act.
Since that time, understanding of the dangers of deploying the military in the domestic arena has diminished. Francis Mullen, administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency, once casually dismissed civil libertarians' concerns about potential abuses if the military joined law enforcement. "There is sufficient oversight on the part of Congress and others," he told a Newsweek reporter, "to deter infringement on individual liberties." A Democratic congressman characterized the Posse Comitatus Act as a "sinful, evil law." Military leaders appear more aware of the danger of deploying forces domestically. Marine Major General Stephen G. Olmstead, deputy assistant secretary of defense for drug policy, warned a Senate subcommittee in 1987 that calling out the military to fight the drug war within the U.S. would be unwise. "One of [America's] greatest strengths is that the military is responsive to civilian authority and that we do not allow the Army, Navy, and the Marines and the Air Force to be a police force. History is replete with countries that allowed that to happen. Disaster is the result."
Use of military procedure by FBI agents proved disastrous at Ruby Ridge. Vicky Weaver was murdered in part because the officers who shot her were governed by military rules of engagement. They allow troops to shoot an enemy on sight  a far cry from the rules controlling domestic law enforcement. At Ruby Ridge the rules of engagement let officers fire at any armed adult, rather than engage in usual threat assessment.
Even though using the military to perform civilian functions is extraordinarily dangerous, the Posse Comitatus Act has gradually been eroded. The Stafford Act of 1984 allows the military to help during natural disasters. After a natural disaster, a governor can ask the president to declare a state of emergency. Once it declares an emergency, FEMA can deploy soldiers on active duty. In August of 1992, the Army was deployed in South Florida to respond to Hurricane Andrew, and a month later on the island of Kauai after Hurricane Iniki.
Since the Posse Comitatus Act remained in effect during this time, soldiers could not enforce the law, arrest or detain civilians, or serve search warrants. In South Florida the soldiers doled out aid to citizens and illegal immigrants alike, no questions asked. Active-duty soldiers were not permitted to provide security at relief centers occupied by civilians.
When it comes to the use of troops to restore order during riots, however, the president can suspend the Posse Comitatus Act at the stroke of a pen. The act doesn't cover soldiers deployed as authorized by the Constitution or exempted from the act by statute. Defense Department regulations* outline one of the larger loopholes. It allows the use of soldiers "to prevent loss of life or wanton destruction of property and to restore governmental functioning and public order when sudden and unexpected civil disturbances, disaster, or calamities seriously endanger life and property and disrupt normal governmental functions."
The reality? The president can deploy troops whenever he feels like it. President Bush did just this in response to the the Los Angeles riots. On April 29, 1992, the jury released its verdict in the Rodney King trial. A wave of riots followed. On May 1, 1992, California asked the president for aid; Bush responded with an executive order allowing the secretary of defense to call out the Army.

should, declare war on an unidentified enemy.

As for ethanol, which you cite, if it's so splendid an alternative, one

       Thanks to federal        protection of the domestic sugar industry, ethanol subsidies,        subsidized grain exports, and various other programs, ADM has        cost the American economy billions of dollars since 1980 and        has indirectly cost Americans tens of billions of dollars in        higher prices and higher taxes over that same period.

    Eavesdrop Now, Reassess Later?
    By Declan McCullagh (declan
    5:00 p.m. Oct. 1, 2001 PDT
    WASHINGTON -- House negotiators have drafted anti-terrorism
    legislation to grant police unprecedented eavesdropping powers that
    would automatically expire in two years.
    Leaders of the House Judiciary committee have crafted a new
    anti-terrorism bill, called the Patriot Act, that includes nearly all
    the surveillance abilities requested by President Bush -- but with a
    sunset date of Dec. 31, 2003. A vote on the bill is expected this
    week.
    A 122-page draft (PDF) of the Patriot Act, obtained by Wired News,
    says that police could conduct Internet wiretaps in some situations
    without court orders, that judges' ability to reject surveillance
    requests would be sharply curtailed, and that the powers of a secret
    federal court would be expanded.

   on wiretapping and Internet monitoring.
   The big difference: The House attached an expiration date to the "USA
   Act" (PDF). The wiretap sections expire in December 2004 -- unless the
   president decides it is in the "national interest" to extend them
   until December 2006.
   During the five-hour debate, legislators complained that House leaders
   had forced a vote before anyone had a chance to review the 175-page
   bill. Early in the morning, top House Republicans met privately and
   abruptly agreed to use the Senate's anti-terrorism bill instead of a
   more moderate one that their colleagues had expected.
   Democrats were the most strident critics of that decision. Barney
   Frank (D-Massachusetts) said: "What we have today is an outrageous
   procedure: A bill, drafted by a handful of people in secret, comes to
   us without a committee review and immune to amendment."
   Frank was talking about a rule handed down from GOP leaders on Friday
   morning that banned any changes to the USA Act before the vote.

My own thoughts: If ZKS wants to display tailored ads, it makes sense that Freedom clients will communicate with the mother ship on a more-or-less regular basis. This is what Eudora and Opera do, and what Freedom 3.0 apparently does (I haven't used it). The question is whether users are aware of the potential privacy risks. --Declan]
Thought you'd be interested in this.
While playing with Zero Knowledge Systems' new
Freedom 3.0 privacy product, I noticed that it actually
notifies Zero Knowledge whenever you start
it up.  It sends a bunch of HTTP requests
(through the M$ IE subsystem, no less) to ZKS.
Here's a sample header:
GET  User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0
Plus all the standard HTTP stuff -- IP address, date/time, etc.
This would also include any cookies set from
zeroknowledge.com, (which ZKS sets every time you go there),
but I filter cookies through the MEconomy system, so
I had none from them.
What's "pid" (I checked -- unrelated to my Win 2K process ID)?
What's prn?
What's "event"?
Why is s it being sent back to zeroknowledge EVERY time I start up Freedom?
Guess even the privacy good guys want to track you.
Hey Declan,
I want to start by saying that Zero-Knowledge absolutely does not track or
profile the users of its Freedom Privacy & Security Tools 3.0 software.
Our software loads updates (e.g. Ad Manager files and e-wallet scripts) as
well as privacy-related content via HTTP. This was the case with previous
versions of the software and is still true today, although today it may
appear more prominent since we have designed Freedom 3.0 with a new user
interface and are carrying more privacy content.
This HTTP activity is covered by our privacy policies.
As for cookies, Zero-Knowledge has always used cookies on its websites, for
the purposes of store-, affiliate- and state-management. These practices are
also reflected in our privacy policies.
Declan, if you still think this is worth forwarding on, I'd appreciate your
at least changing the subject header you sent me. The implication that
delivering web content means tracking users, is mistaken.

Debate last evening:
   Mrs. ROUKEMA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.
Oxley) for yielding the time. I rise in strong support of this
legislation today.
   Many of us in this Chamber have worked for a number of years to
provide the law enforcement tools that we need to fight the drug trade,
money launderers, and terrorists; and in the wake of September 11, the
terrorist attacks, this has never been more important. And indeed, we
may soon learn that the anthrax attacks are financed by the same money
sources. We do not know that yet.
   The point is that, as has already been outlined, particularly by the
gentleman from New York (Mr. LaFalce), I want to commend him for
stating some of the specifics of this legislation. He has been a
leader, and we have [[Page H7203]] worked together on this, and whether we are talking about the bill
prohibiting correspondent banking privileges for offshore shell banks
and authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to take special measures
if a foreign country or bank is deemed to present a money laundering
threat, the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaFalce) went into great
detail on that, and I want to associate myself with his remarks.
   The bill is not perfect. I am sorry that, for example, we excluded
making it a crime to smuggle over $10,000 interstate. We included it
for overseas, but it was not included for interstate. Nevertheless,
this is an excellent bill.
   I would like to say to some of the nay sayers that complain about the
provisions, as to whether or not they deny due process or whatever, the
question has been asked are we endangering the rights and privacy of
innocent Americans. The answer is no, but it does give our law
enforcement officials the requirements that they need for their careful
investigation. It gives our regulators and law enforcement officials
what they need to get the job done.
   May I say that in this brave new world of terrorists, we must cripple
this demonic network. Let me just have a couple of additional seconds
to say that unless we have this strong provision in the bill, it would
make a mockery of the legislation; and it is an absolutely essential
core of anti-terrorist legislation.

Sensenbenner Urges Senate Action Today
WASHINGTON, D.C. - The House today passed anti-terrorism legislation by a 357-66 margin.  H.R. 3162, introduced by House Judiciary Committee Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr. (R-Wis.), is expected to be considered by the Senate today or tomorrow and then sent to President Bush for his signature.
"Today, the House came together in a bipartisan manner to pass landmark anti-terrorism legislation which provides federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies the tools they need to combat the scourges of international and domestic terrorism.  Our country remains vulnerable to terrorism and our President needs this bill to fight the clear and present danger posed by Al Queda and other terrorist organizations," said Chairman "I have heard that certain Senators have placed holds on this anti-terrorism bill to press their own parochial issues.  This is the time to dispense with business as usual.  It is time for leadership; I urge the Senate to pass this legislation today."

When I first heard that Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle Corp., had proposed
a national I.D. card to help fight terrorism, I thought it was a joke. Not
the I.D. card idea. But that Ellison was proposing it.
Dershowitz contends that the cards might actually increase freedoms. "Four
Arab-looking guys reading the Koran are much less suspicious if they have
the cards and can just slash them through card readers," he said.
It is the lack of an I.D. card, however, that makes the United States almost
unique among nations. "You do have a right to be left alone in the most
literal sense," says Nadine Strossen, president of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
"If you have an I.D. card," says former Rep. Tom Campbell (R-Calif.), now a
law professor at Stanford, "it is solely for the purpose of allowing the
government to compel you to produce it. This would essentially give the
government the power to demand that we show our papers. It is a very
dangerous thing."
Dangerous? Yes, there are dangers to a mandatory national I.D. card, but
there may be greater dangers without one. The fact is, to live in a society
as vulnerable as ours, we may have to give up something - but I disagree
that what's lost is freedom. Instead, it's privacy, and maybe not even that.
In an interview with SiliconValley.com, Ellison expressed this reality in
his typical over-the-top fashion, showing once again why he is the wrong guy
to be making the pitch. "This privacy you're concerned about is largely an
illusion. All you have to give up is your illusions, not your privacy."
The truth is that an I.D. card may force you to give up some of your
privacy - though probably no more than driver's licenses, Social Security
cards, credit cards and even electronic toll-readers like EasyPass force you
to give up now. But even if privacy is lost, the question is whether such an
exchange is worth the benefits? More and more, I believe that it is.

Attorney Calls on Justice Dept to Close Hate Site

(CNSNews.com) - A prominent First Amendment lawyer called on the U.S.
Justice Department to conduct an immediate investigation of an Internet
site that advocates "a horrible death by any means" for people who
oppose homosexual activism.
The web site, usqueers.com, is in violation of state and federal law for

It's important to be clear about what characteristics of a national ID
card are objectionable. Among those may be a requirement that it be
shown on demand, that it be tied to databases that track movements,
etc. What is disturbing about a national ID card is not the fact that
it's standardized, for instance, but an array of features that could
crop up elsewhere.
It is possible to imagine a scenario where a database-linked,
biometric-tied system using driver's licenses is worse -- that is,
more privacy-invasive -- than some forms of a "national ID card."

H.R. 3275 is legislation implementing two international treaties cracking down on terrorism that have been signed by the United States and are expected to be ratified by the Senate in the very near future.
The International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings requires parties to the treaty to criminalize the act of terrorist bombing aimed at public or governmental facilities, or public transportation or infrastructure facilities and to either prosecute or extradite any person within their jurisdiction who engages in these bombings.  Violators would be subject to up to life in prison, and if death results from the violation, up to life in prison or the death penalty.
The International Convention for the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism requires nations to criminalize the act of collecting or providing funds with the intention that they will be used to support acts of international terrorists.  The Convention imposes binding legal obligations upon nations either to prosecute or extradite any person within their jurisdiction who unlawfully and willfully provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used to carry out various terrorist activities.  H.R. 3275 subjects violators to up to twenty years in prison and fines of at least Witnesses: Mr. Michael Chertoff, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, U.S. Justice Department; others TBA.
H.R. 3209 would make it a felony for an individual who engages in a hoax with the intent to convey false or misleading information that there is or will be a chemical, biological, nuclear or weapon of mass destruction attack.  Violators would be subject to up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.

@_subject: Hush press release: Microsoft Outlook "secure solution" 
November 2001: Hush Communications are pleased to introduce HushMail
Professional(tm), for Outlook 2000, the latest addition to its suite of easy
to use secure solutions.
HushMail Professional is a secure desktop solution that offers maximum
strength security (2048 bit), easy-to-use functionality including digital
signature facility, and other exciting features without the user having to
change their existing email provider.
Whether communicating a private opinion, business critical data, or a
negotiating strategy, the HushMail Professional user is able to send
encrypted email to any Hush user in the world, as well as digitally signed
email to anyone with a valid email address. With HushMail Professional users
can communicate in confidence, knowing that our state-of-the-art encryption
engine is protecting and authenticating the data.
Furthermore, HushMail Professional is just one of the solutions Hush
Communications offer with OpenPGP compliancy.  Using HushMail Professional
in conjunction with HushTools ( users can now communicate
securely with PGP and other member company applications, creating a
universal interoperable platform for secure digital technologies. PGP is the
most widely used email security protocol and this new version opens up
HushMail Professional users to an estimated 8 million PGP users worldwide.
Support for OpenPGP marks a major breakthrough in widening the appeal and
usability of Hush solutions, as it has achieved interoperability for
personal privacy and business security.
The explosive growth in e-commerce has created a battleground for secure
digital communications solutions, offering a multitude of products and
services. PKI is the only technology that provides for all critical network
security needs. These are authentication, confidentiality, data integrity,
non-repudiation, flexibility, and scalability. However, to many users, PKI
solutions are difficult to use and complex to implement. In addition, most
PKI products are not interoperable and this problem needed to be addressed
before secure services can be widely accepted. Digital organizations need to
have a common PKI system, since the various systems cannot communicate with
each other.
Hush Communications, a leading provider of managed security services and
encryption technology, is committed to the development of the Internet as a
safe and trusted business channel by delivering security technologies that
overcome interoperability problems.
In addition to HushMail Professional for Outlook 2000, other offerings
include solutions for small businesses, large enterprises, data storage
security, a Web-based tool kit for communications and a software development
kit that enables companies and developers to integrate seamless encryption
into their own business applications. Hush Communications are inviting
interested parties to review HushMail Professional immediately.
Interviews by phone or by appointment are welcomed.
Phil Zimmermann, one of the world's leading encryption experts, joined Hush
as chief cryptographer. His appointment strengthened efforts to establish
Hush as the de facto global standard of encrypted email. Zimmermann is
regarded as one of the fathers of modern encryption having created PGP
(Pretty Good Privacy), a premier email encryption program and currently one
of the world's leading encryption standards.
Phil is available to discuss the new product, our solutions range and other
issues such as:
7	The Open PGP Alliance.
7	Interoperability - the issues.
7	PKI - how it works and how it is used.
7	Creating a de facto standard for secure messaging.
7	Securing the Internet - reality or pipe dream?
7	Digital Signatures and legislation.
7	Hush Communications products and services line.
7	Outsourcing PKI.
Hush is a founding member of the OpenPGP Alliance ( an
organization dedicated to promoting compatibility among private electronic
communications systems. The company's solutions are patented and are bought
by companies in the financial, medical, and legal markets, among others.
We welcome all inquiries and review requests and we look forward to hearing
from you.

To defray in part the costs of running the site, I use Burst Media
(burstmedia.com), an ad agency similar in principle to Doubleclick.  I
include a small chunk of HTML code at the top of the webpage -- Burst
salespeople sell the ads and they run on my and other sites (Burst's
commission varies from 30 to 50 percent).
I do not review the ads that appear on my site, and Burst adds and
deletes advertisers (generally about 50 are cycling through at any one
time) from the list without consulting me. News organizations would
call this an editorial firewall. Burst does give me the ability to
make broad choices, like reject gambling or alcohol ads (I allow them)
or pop-up ads (I reject them).
I'd do the same with the evil blinking ads that Tim hates, if there
was a category I could reject. Fortunately, it's trivial to use
ad-blocking software if this bothers you.
The online ad business is in the toilet, true, but if I can pay part
of the server hosting fee through the ads, I'm inclined to keep doing
it. In any case, it's a stretch to say I have "established a business
relationship" with an advertiser when I have no idea what ads are
appearing -- it's only correct to say I've established a business
relationship with Burst.

This Bangor Daily News article tells a different story about the incident involving Green Party activist Nancy Oden at a Maine airport last week:
The article, by Jeff Tuttle, says:
The Green Party has put out a press release, which contains no evidence to buttress Oden's claim that she was singled out before even arriving at the airport for her political views:
Previous Politech message and interview with Oden:
Seems she's got a background of association with ecoterrorism.
Glenn's above URL says:
    It is possible that this story happened exactly the way Nancy Oden wrote
it up, but I would be very surprised if there is not another side to this
story as well.  Most National Guard enlisted soldiers have barely heard of
the Green Party let alone would know who a Maine party leader was, what she
wrote in a local paper, or would care.
    The National Guard units of Maine, like National Guard units in every
other state, are on a very steep learning curve regarding how to manage
airport security.  It is not a duty that National Guard units routinely
trained for before Sept. 11 except for those Guard and reserve units involved
in Civil Administration.  The National Guard soldiers will make plenty of
mistakes, including big ones, along the way.  Members of Guard units come
from all civilian occupations and it is not impossible that a few might have
voted for Green Party candidates in 2000.  But to start a myth that every
local activist is being targeted by the National Guard for his or her
political views is just plain silly.
    As long as they are not carrying box cutters or pose a threat to other
passengers, no one cares if Green Party officers fly to their heart's content
from Bangor to Bute.  But one wonders if riding a bike would not be more
environmentally friendly than those polluting planes.

Military Bars Green Party Leader from Flying
   posted by declan on Saturday November 03,    from the airports-are-now-a-no-speech-zone dept.
        As one of the U.S. Green Party's top officials, Nancy Oden is
   used to controversy. But Oden never expected to be hassled by National
   Guard troops at her hometown airport of Bangor, Maine on Thursday and
   barred from flying out of it. She thinks it's because of a Green Party
   statement she co-authored that ran in the local newspaper. The
   statement calls for universal health care, limitations on free trade,
   and a stop to "U.S. military incursions" including the bombing of
   Afghanistan. (The Green Party has labeled the U.S. military action an
   act of "state terrorism.") Oden's unsuccessful attempt to fly to
   Chicago for a Green Party national meeting follows a Philadelphia man's
   unpleasant experience after reading the wrong book at an airport, a
   California journalist's headaches for daring to take photos inside an
   airport, and the arrest of another man in Germany for bringing
   politically-unacceptable reading material to an airport. Also see
   Indymedia coverage of Oden's experience; the transcript of our
   interview with her from her home in Jonesboro, Maine is below.

   "Just a few weeks ago I had a piece in the Bangor paper. It's on our
   website, greenparty.org... I submitted it under my name alone. It's a
   fairly radical piece; that's what I do. I'm a political and
   environmental activist.
   "I walked into the Bangor airport. What I saw was National Guard folks
   all over carrying machine guns... The atmosphere was very tense...
   This was Thursday... I went over to the American Airlines ticket
   counter way down at the end. Nobody else was there, except the clerk.
   I gave him my name. He didn't even ask for photo ID. It was almost
   like they were expecting me. He put it into the computer. He stayed on
   the computer a long time, like 10 minutes.
   "He put an S on the boarding pass, for search. He said, 'You've been
   picked for having your bag searched.' ... I said to him, 'This wasn't
   random, was it?' He said, 'No you were in there to be searched, no
   matter what.' I went over to baggage to put my bags through the X-ray
   and then went into the boarding area.
   "There was this National Guard guy there. He yells over at me, so
   everyone can hear, 'Bring your bags over here.' You know how they are
   when they're all puffed up with themselves. He said, 'Hurry up,' so I
   slowed down some more.
   "I put my bags on the table. The two women employees were standing
   there. [I tried to help them with a stuck zipper.] He grabbed my left
   arm, he started yelling in my face, 'Don't you know what happened?
   Sep. 11, don't you know thousands of people died?' I said, 'You can't
   do that.' He went to grab my arm, and I said, 'Don't touch me.' I saw
   an older airline guy shake his head, 'No,' and he backed off.
   "That insulted his little manhood. He could not force me to listen to
   his idiot ideas on Sep. 11, whatever it was he wanted to say. So he
   was angry. I hadn't done anything except pull away from him... I think
   he was trying to provoke me. They did the wand thing, they were done,
   and I heard him say real soft, 'Don't let her on the plane,' like he
   was talking to himself.
   "Then I go to get on the plane since we're all done and everything,
   and the American Airlines ticket guy says,' You can't get on the
   plane.' I say, 'Why not?' ... He says, 'Because this guy says you
   didn't cooperate with the search.' ... I said, 'Didn't you see him
   grab my arm?' He said, 'No, your back was to me.'
   "He said, 'Maybe we can get you on the 4:00 plane, it's the last one
   today.' I felt, okay, let's put up with this aggravation now and I'll
   go to Chicago and we'll see what we can do... Then this little guard
   guy, it wasn't enough to stop me, wasn't done with me. He said, 'Come
   with me.' I followed very slowly, I sat down for a while. I said I'm
   carrying these bags; I need a rest... It's called passive resistance.
   "He went and found the airport police to come and talk with me. He
   went and got six other National Guard guys and they all approached me.
   Here are these six untrained, ignorant,
   don't-know-how-to-deal-with-the-public, machine-gun-armed young guys
   in their camouflage suits with their military gear hanging off of it.
   "I looked up and started laughing, 'Is all this for me, guys? What is
   this about?' There was this big burly guy, he was in front. He said,
   'You didn't cooperate with the search.' ... I said what he did was
   grabbed my arm, and I backed away... He said he only hit your arm. I
   said even if that's all he did, he's not allowed to do that. He can't
   hit my arm and demand I listen to him.
   "They had the airport policeman tell me, 'You're not flying out of
   this airport today.' ... Of course I had cooperated; why do I care if
   they search my bags? ... What I didn't like was being singled out
   because of my political views. They couldn't arrest me because there
   was no reason for that. They had people who saw there was nothing to
   arrest me for. They wanted to get back at me somehow because I was not
   a subservient female, because I questioned their manhood.
   "I went to the American Airlines guy and said, 'Is this just today?'
   He said, 'I don't know.' One clerk said, 'You could drive to Boston
   [five hours away] and see if you can get out of there.'
   "I never made it out of Bangor. I had to turn around and drive 100
   miles back home... The fact that they gave the other airlines my
   name... They told me they did that... That's incredible."

procedural safeguards, and that it preserves the authority of civilian

The other interpretation is that Bush does not want to limit the power

The thing is, though, that if Bush intends to try the second approach,

Tim already offered some counterexamples to your claim.
But let's not get away from digital cash for the moment. The reasons
we don't have digital cash are different from the reasons we don't have
widely deployed crypto, say for email or hard drive security. Crypto's not-as-extensive-as-possible use is due mostly to deployment
problems, and to a lesser extent user interface problems (ever try to
teach your mom/grandmother to use PGP and manage keys, even with the
plugins?). While algorithms may have changed, the basic approach to
crypto hasn't. Politics isn't standing in the way: Even the US didn't
try to ban crypto after Sep. 11. To crypto-fy a communication, all you
need is two consenting users.
Not so with digital cash. It also suffers from deployment problems, of
course, but far more substantial regulatory ones. You need two
consenting users -- and a tie-in to the banking system (preferable) or
at least some exchange of value (like e-gold) that's sufficiently
trusted. Crypto may peeve the FBI, but widespread digital cash is far
more alarming to governments, which will not permit true digital cash
to be deployed in any popular way. One obvious way to limit its utility
is to restrict its tie-ins with the banking system, or prohibit businesses
within their borders from using it.
That's the crypto winter.

Thanks, Tim, for posting an interesting essay. You say:
To expand on this: It seems that using "reputation capital" to
describe a multifaceted information space such as even the most
wretched of cypherpunks posters does not do that person justice. Even
if someone is generally correct and truth-telling, he may also be
immoral or a fan of invasive police measures or immature in debate or
prone to violations of netiquette -- any of which might lower his
reputation capital.
Sure, one can say: let's just have a complicated reputation space
(think an array of arrays) for each one of these characteristics. To
use a silly example:
    * truthtelling [0-255]
    * maturity [0-255]
    * morality [0-255]
    * netiquette [0-255]
    * spelling [0-255]
    * etc.
But that quickly becomes burdensome to use as a shorthand.
It seems to me that reputation capital is a term that has limited
value when applied to something as subjective as the areas above:
having an article published in the editorial pages of the Wall Street
Journal (or the Journal of Socialist Doctrine) may lower your
reputation capital among some people and raise it among others. This
is the nature of subjectivity.
Reputation capital is more valuable a term when describing traits that
are less subjective. When dealing with an online ecash bank, you may
want truthfulness and reliability and good customer service (for

X-Mailer: QUALCOMM Windows Eudora Version 5.1
X-URL: Politech is at Thanks to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), one of our great champions of privacy, private property, and limited government, any American buying a gun from a dealer or other licensed seller may have their name permanently embedded in the FBI's NICS database.
Currently federal law ( orders the FBI to "destroy all records" of a gun purchase that is approved as lawful. Naturally those champions of individual liberty at the FBI and Justice Department have creatively interpreted this straightforward requirement -- to mean precisely the opposite of what the law says. Thus records have been kept for a period of 90 to 180 days.
Schumer's bill would "allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to access NICS audit log records for the purpose of responding to an inquiry from any federal, state, or local law enforcement agency in connection with a civil or criminal law enforcement investigation." Seems to me that would let the FBI access and store records of the vast bulk of firearm purchasers from this point on, if this bill were to become law. Here's the text of Schumer's proposal:
Naturally the section reducing the privacy of lawabiding Americans is titled "privacy protection." Glad to know that Schumer hasn't lost his touch.
(Note: Not all U.S. firearm purchases must go through a dealer who checks in with the NICS database. Private sales are still, for now, allowed without federal records kept.)
    Senators Propose 'Gun Owner Registration'
    By Jeff Johnson
    CNSNews.com Congressional Bureau Chief
    December 17, 2001
    Capitol Hill (CNSNews.com) - Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) wants the
    Department of Justice to keep personal data on law-abiding gun buyers
    from the National Instant Check System (NICS), and to offer the
    information for unlimited use by state and local agencies.
    National Rifle Association Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre
    called the move "gun owner registration, plain and simple."
    Making good on a promise he made during a Senate Judiciary Committee
    hearing December 6, Schumer introduced the "Use NICS in Terrorist
    Investigations Act" (S. 1788) after Attorney General John Ashcroft
    refused to allow the FBI access to NICS records of lawful gun
    purchases.

"Terrorism and Guns: Ashcroft's 'coddling' of gun owners,"
by Dave Kopel ( Independence Institute,
and Prof. Glenn Reynolds ( Univ. of Tennessee
from the National Review Online, Dec. 17, 2001,
Attorney General John Ashcroft has come under fire for what Boston Globe columnist Tom Oliphant calls "coddling" gun owners.  Oliphant's attack was the latest round in the concerted assault on Ashcroft's Second Amendment positions, which started this spring when Ashcroft announced his view (since supported by the recent U.S. Court of Appeals decision in United States v. Emerson,  that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to arms.
Ashcroft's stance was consistent with that of the attorneys general for Ronald Reagan, Franklin Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, and Andrew Jackson, among others (  It was also consistent with most Supreme Court statements citing the Second Amendment, including everything the Rehnquist Court has ever said Ashcroft's view mirrored repeated congressional declarations of the individual right to arms -- including in the Freedmen's Bureau Act of 1866, the Property Requisition Act of 1941, and the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986.  It's also compatible with a wide variety of gun controls, as demonstrated by the Court of Appeals decision in Emerson, which ruled that the particular federal gun law at issue did not violate the Second Amendment.
Ashcroft was, however, out of step with the antigun groups, who recognize that a meaningful Second Amendment makes it impossible to ban guns across the board.  For the same reason, the attorney general was out of step with the position of the Clinton/Gore/Reno administration.  Indeed, the difference between the Bush/Ashcroft view of the Second Amendment ( and the Clinton/Gore/Reno view was -- as President Clinton admitted -- the reason Gore lost five close states, and thus the election.
Still smarting from that humiliation, gun prohibition groups have decided to attack Ashcroft for obeying federal gun statutes and for complying with a regulation created by Attorney General Janet Reno.  Last week, on the morning Ashcroft was scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, New York Times reporter Fox Butterfield turned a press release from a gun-prohibition group, the Violence Policy Center ( into a Times article.  Ashcroft's opponents on the Senate Judiciary then used the article to excoriate Ashcroft for obeying the law.  Predictably, gun-prohibition sympathizers like Oliphant and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Cynthia Tucker have begun piling on.
At issue was Ashcroft's decision to tell the FBI that it couldn't start rummaging though the federal records of *legal* gun buyers as part of its terrorism investigation.  Indeed, the law forbids the keeping of such records in the first place.  It does, however, authorize the federal government to retain records of people -- such as illegal aliens, or people with temporary visas -- who illegally attempt to buy guns.  Those records are available to the FBI for any and every law enforcement purpose.
Mr.  Butterfield didn't bother to inform his Times readers about what federal law actually says.  So let's examine the laws directly.
Since 1998, all federally regulated gun purchases require that the buyer obtain approval from the FBI's "National Instant-Check System," which ensures that the buyer is not a "prohibited person."  NICS checks the buyer's name against a database of felons and other prohibited people.
The NRA had pushed the instant check as an alternative to the Brady Bill's waiting period.  As a compromise, Congress made the waiting period effective for five years (1994-98) for handguns only, to be replaced in 1998 by the instant check on all guns.  Determined to prevent NICS from being perverted into a gun registration system, Congress -- thanks to votes of many Brady Bill supporters -- specifically forbade the government to compile records of lawful purchasers.
As enacted, the national instant check law, 18 U.S. Code 922(t) ( provides that:
(2) If receipt of a firearm would not violate subsection (g) or (n) or State law, the [Instant-Check] system shall --
(A) assign a unique identification number to the transfer;
(B) provide the licensee with the number; and
(C) destroy all records of the system with respect to the call (other than the identifying number and the date the number was assigned) and all records of the system relating to the person or the transfer.
(Emphasis added.)
This means, of course, that if the feds were following the law, there wouldn't be any records to examine, since they're supposed to be destroyed once a sale is approved.
It also means that every congressman who voted for final passage of the Brady Act in 1993 (including Senators Kennedy, Biden, and Leahy, as well as then-Representative Schumer) voted for this explicit ban on keeping the federal records of legal gun buyers.
The 1993 prohibition was reinforcing a 1986 Congressional statute, the Firearms Owners' Protection Act (FOPA), which creates a blanket ban on a federal gun registry.  The relevant part of FOPA, 18 U.S. Code 926 ( (a) The Secretary may prescribe only such rules and regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter...  No such rule or regulation prescribed after the date of the enactment of the Firearms Owners' Protection Act may require that records required to be maintained under this chapter or any portion of the contents of such records, be recorded at or transferred to a facility owned, managed, or controlled by the United States or any State or any political subdivision thereof, nor that any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions be established.  Nothing in this section expands or restricts the Secretary's authority to inquire into the disposition of any firearm in the course of a criminal investigation.
Of the current members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who were in the Senate in 1986, only Kennedy voted against passage of FOPA.  Senators Biden, Leahy, Hatch, Thurmond, Grassely, and Specter all voted for it, and hence for the registration ban.
In addition, the annual appropriation for the Department of the Treasury (which controls the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) always contains a ban on spending any funds for creation of a federal gun registry.
Quite plainly, all this means that (1) records aren't supposed to be kept on legal purchases of firearms, and (2) it's illegal to establish a national gun registration system.  This was underscored in the recent case of RSM v. Buckles, 254 F.3d 61 (4th Cir. 2001) ( where the federal Court of Appeals pointed out that the government's power to scrutinize gun records was limited, and that a national gun-registration system -- even one established through "backdoor efforts" -- was illegal.
Even so, when preparing to implement the National Instant Check System, then-Attorney General Reno announced that the government would keep records on lawful gun purchasers for 180 days.  The stated purpose of these records was to audit NICS, to make sure it wasn't being misused (e.g., to ensure that gun dealers were not requesting instant checks on people who were not their customers -- for example, in case a gun-store owner started requesting background checks on his daughter's boyfriends).
The NRA sued, arguing that by saying the records had to be destroyed, Congress did not mean they should be destroyed "eventually, when the Attorney General gets around to it."  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in a 2-1 decision ( upheld the 180-day record retention.  The majority opinion, written by a Clinton appointee, claimed that federal law "does not prohibit all forms of registration."  The Clinton majority also asserted that because Congress did not say the records had to be destroyed "immediately," the records could be destroyed sooner -- or later.
Dissenting, Judge David B.  Sentelle, a Reagan appointee, retorted that Congress had been perfectly clear.  "The Attorney General's position," wrote Sentelle, "strikes me as reminiscent of a petulant child pulling her sister's hair.  Her mother tells her, 'Don't pull the baby's hair.'  The child says, 'All right, Mama,' but again pulls the infant's hair.  Her defense is, 'Mama, you didn't say I had to stop right now.'"
The Senate responded to Reno's machinations by restating its 1993 intent.  In 1998, Senator Bob Smith (R., N.H.)  proposed a rider to an appropriations bill to mandate immediate records destruction.  The Senate approved the Smith Amendment, 69 to 31, thanks in part to the support of Senators Daschle, Leahy, and Murray.  Later, a conference committee stripped the Smith Amendment, as well as some other non-appropriations riders, from the appropriation bill.
During the 2000 election, candidate Bush condemned the Clinton/Gore/Reno registry of legal gun buyers, and promised to terminate it.
Meanwhile, Reno promulgated a regulation cutting the retention time to 90 days.  The Reno regulation forbids the use of the NICS registry for general law enforcement purposes, while allowing registry use for auditing the performance of NICS, as well as for civil or criminal cases arising from the operation of NICS.
Thus, it is plainly illegal for the FBI to dig into the NICS registry for general investigations.  Had Attorney General Ashcroft allowed such access, he would have violated the law.  (This summer, Ashcroft proposed a revised regulation to cut the retention time to 24 hours, but even this shorter time period violates the congressional mandate that records be destroyed, not kept for "a short period of time.")
Fox Butterfield neglected to tell his readers about the 1986 law forbidding a federal gun registry.  He also didn't tell them about the 1993 law mandating destruction of records on legal buyers.  Of the Smith Amendment

Jim Bell photos:
Day-by-day articles on Jim Bell's trial:
   One of the Internet's most famous essayists is now in
   the same prison that once housed the most famous hacker.
   Jim Bell, the author of Assassination Politics, has been moved to the
   Lompoc ("lahm-poke"), California federal prison. It's the same place
   that convicted cracker Kevin Mitnick once called home.
   "I'm assigned out in the rec yard, the recreation yard, but there's
   really not much work to be done, occasionally picking up a cigarette
   butt or two," says Bell, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison this
   year for allegedly stalking federal agents. Bell says he was trying to
   investigate government wrongdoing.
   Bell describes Lompoc, located between Los Angeles and San Francisco,
   as "old and decrepit, and the place is corrupt and the guards are
   lazy."
   Previously, Bell was being held at the SeaTac prison near Tacoma,
   Washington, where his trial took place.
   Since he's got some time to kill, Bell has busied himself by filing
   civil lawsuits against people he alleges were involved in an
   orchestrated plot to deny him a fair trial and an unbiased,
   court-appointed defense counsel. So far he's targeted two judges, at
   least two prosecutors, and his former probation officers and defense
   attorneys.
   Bell says he hasn't had any response yet -- and is going to try to
   obtain a default judgment against the defendants. "I continue to
   remain astonished that I haven't received any answer out of my lawsuit
   yet. It doesn't bother me as long as I collect the money. I think I've
   hit a nerve."
   He's looking forward to "garnishment and putting liens on various
   people's property. If they wanted to write me a check, I'd take a
   check, I guess. But if they want me to go through the usual methods to
   collect it, I'll do that too."

Well, by your standards, any journalist who makes an innocent mistake would be a liar. I think the truth is that the reporters honestly believed they had a solid story -- but their editors should have stepped in and killed it or postponed it until they had unearthed more evidence. Reporters can get carried away on a story and lose focus; this is why you have multiple layers of editors at most news organizations. I don't remember how the videotape was edited -- you may be right; I just don't remember the details.

I always enjoy Jonathan's essays, and this one is no exception. He
properly points out the disturbing analogy that Attorney General
Ashcroft seems to make (
between criticism and treason. The craven broadcast media, as
Jonathan says, buckling to government "please-don't-air-this" pressure

But a few points:
* Is it appropriate to use the powerful word "censorship" to describe
what happened when the National Review dropped Ann Coulter? Coulter
has other outlets that will publish her work; she is not muzzled. Like
other news organizations with a certain perspective, the National
Review has an implicit contract with their writers that says something
stuff-far-outside-of-it. In the absence of evidence to the contrary,
it's reasonable to assume that she understood this implicit agreement
when she signed up. More to the point, she (I recall) took her initial
grievance over not running the column public and slammed the editors,
who then axed her. Using "censorship" to characterize the facts of
this dispute weakens the term for when it's really needed -- to
describe government action that puts people in prison cells.
* Of course it's disturbing when government officials tell Americans
to self-censor. But it is also important to note, lest this vital fact
be lost in the charges of "private censorship," that I can think of no
court action the government has taken to prevent people from speaking
or publishing information about the "war on terror." A quick review of

Obviously phone calls from White House aides can have a chilling
effect, but then again the news organization or ISP can stand firm and
call the government's bluff. (And yes, I'd say this lack of such cases

Seems to me like a straightforward economic analysis. Rates a remailer
operator will charge reflect his cost plus. If the rates become too
high, the remailer will go out of business. If customers perceive
their privacy is in danger because remailers are going bankrupt and
the cloud is shrinking, the remaining remailers will lose revenue and,
in extremis, again go out of business.
Assuming that all users are using the network roughly equally and
therefore paying roughly the same, this suggests there's a critical
number of users necessary to keep a for-profit network afloat.
But change the assumption about paying equally, and the critical number
may approach one. "A small number of high-paying remailer customers"
could bankroll the remailer network by providing direct subsidies to
the remailer operators or giving out free
can-be-used-for-remailing-only tokens to anyone who asks.

True, but it's a pretty extraordinary quote that seems to have allegedly taken place in a private meeting; extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof, no?

@_subject: Israel's control of the U.S. -- and debunking rumors 
I just did a lexis-nexis search on:
"Jewish people control America and the Americans know it" AND date aft 9/10/2001
Eric Cordian's claim is false. There is a discussion of that alleged
quote in what appears to be the editorial pages ofthe Omaha
World-Herald on October 1, 2001 -- two days before Cordian claims
Sharon said it. Did Cordian's source get the date wrong but the quote right? Well,
here's an excerpt from that discussion:
With reference to Bruce Malina's question (Oct. 27 Pulse) as to why
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's statement to Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres wasn't reported in the U.S. media: The answer is that it
is difficult to believe that any Israeli leader could be so stupid as
to say, "We, the Jewish people, control America, and the Americans
know it." Mr. Malina uses a very suspect source, the Washington Report
of Oct. 3. The Washington Report is a monthly magazine influenced by
Andy Kilgore, who had been U.S. ambassador to several Arab
countries. This magazine provides the most obsessive pro-Arab and
anti-Israeli reading in the United States. An example of its bias is
an article in its April-May 1992 issue that suggests that John F.
Kennedy was assassinated by the Mossad so that Lyndon Johnson, who was
considered to be pro-Israel, could become president.
The quote also appears in an Oct. 13 bylined article in The
Tallahassee Democrat:
So how does Israel, in turn, show its reliability as a friend to the
United States? To answer that question, we turn to an Oct. 3 report
from the Palestinian Information Center in occupied
Jerusalem. According to this report, an argument broke out during a
recent Israeli Cabinet session between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and
his foreign minister, Shimon Peres. Peres had warned Sharon that if
they didn't heed America's request for a cease-fire with the
Palestinians it would endanger Israeli interests and turn the United
States against them.  At which point, a furious Sharon reportedly told
Peres, "Every time we do something, you tell me that America will do
this or do that. I want to tell you something very clear. Don't worry
about American pressure on Israel. We, the Jewish people, control
America, and the Americans know it."
No other newspapers matched that search phrase.
Whatever Sharon's true feelings, the provenance of that quote
seems especially dubious. If you believe otherwise, I have some
1,000:1 compression software to sell you.

@_subject: Australian cops interrogate Jim-Bell quoting online anarchist 
X-URL: Politech is at There are those people who seek out trouble. Still others accidentally attract it. And then there are those who have devoted their lives to stalking trouble, running it to ground, sneaking up behind it, thwapping it on the nose, proclaiming that its mother wears combat boots, and daring it to an impromptu match of fisticuffs. Afterward they lie, nose-bloodied and battered, on the ground and grumble. (In a grudge match, trouble always wins.)
Matt Stephen Taylor (who goes by "proffr" and "mattd") is one of those people. If awards were given for Most Innovative Way to Taunt Police, this self-described anarchist would be a gold medalist in the category of performance art. For the last few months, as far as I can tell, he's done little but tempt trouble:
Trouble came and went when mattd/proffr, who lives in central Victoria, Australia, taunted the Cincinnati police. He allegedly posted threats against Steven Roach, the policeman whose shooting of an unarmed black man led to riots in Cincinnati. But the Australian cops nabbed proffr/mattd first, and proffr/mattd pled guilty to vandalizing a McDonald's restaurant.
While the legal process is going forward, mattd/proffr has amused himself by subscribing to the cypherpunks list, a place not known for people who are readily offended. Yet his unique combination of rants and inchoate posts (my filters have snared about 780 of them) has driven subscribers to invent custom procmail recipies to complain about off-topic messages. One message that went to his Internet provider was a little whiny by list standards, but captured the sentiment well:
mattd/proffr appears to have subscribed to the cypherpunks list to carry on the dubious mission of Jim Bell, the author of the long-winded anarcho screed Assassination Politics. Bell wrote how the next generation of Internet entrepreneurs will use digital cash, anonymous remailers, and such to off miscreant federal agents (Bell especially didn't care for tax Bell, of course, was convicted last year by a Washington state jury and is serving 10 years in the Lompoc federal prison. Bell was another dedicated trouble-hunter, as was Carl Johnson, a cypherpunk who was convicted of threats but is now out of gaol, at least temporarily (his probation officer apparently told him not to seek trouble by continuing to participate in list discussions):
Although Bell technically was convicted for allegedly stalking federal agents, his essay and political views became a big part of his trial:
Now mattd/proffr seems to want to follow the Bell-Johnson precedent by emailing semi-random rants and Assassination Politics-related references to the cypherpunks list, and, I presume, just about everywhere else. Here's a representative excerpt from one of his posts:
It's a lot longer, but you get the idea.
This style of posting seems to have raised some eyebrows inside the Australian constabulary, not to mention leading to a raid, a laptop seizure, and an interrogation or two. Read in mattd/proffr's own words below how he hasn't given up on tempting trouble.
Bomb bomb.I may be charged with making death threats in "e-mail's"(police description.) directed toward the victorian police and a State govt (victorian.)minister,Rob 'buckethead'Hulls.A policeman ,who killed a citizen and was found with KKK literature and extensive weaponry collection,norman scott cheasley's name was mentioned as was the Police commissioner,C.Nixon.The two post's looked more like warnings than threats.
One was posted at a board where "anyone can download"(police prosecutor under oath.) early last year.
The 2cnd mentioned was made just hours prior to the serving of a warrant.It was not mentioned in the warrant.(couldn't have been.)So on the basis of basically one post made to one (anarchist,according to police.) website,(that doesn't require registration or keep logs) The police have seized my laptop,kept it over 8 months and still have to bring actual charges.They may still not bring charges.The post's seem so incoherent as to be nonsensical.Assassination politics was not mentioned during the interview though it featured strongly at my bail hearing last year and was fairly widely reported in the tabloid and local papers.Indymedia,where the post's were left (not e-mailed) by person or persons unknown,has had a couple of legal problems,one of them allegedly by me at the (now defunct) Ohio valley site.I do remember making that post.(stephen Roach,dead man I made a "no comment' interview under legal advice.I deny making death threats, or any threats actually,I'm advocating assassination politics or APster strictly for its value as entertainment journalism.I will vigorously defend any charges bought arising from this gross abuse of State power.I hope to sue the police for malicious prosecution.I will certainly be complaining to the ombudsman.One attempt to retrieve the dell has already cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars.

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY

Alexandria, Virginia 22314
FAX  703/299-3981   Media Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FEBRUARY 27, 2002
ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA United States Attorney Paul J. McNulty and Michael Chertoff, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, announced today the first guilty plea in the Eastern District of Virginia in the largest international online copyright piracy investigation conducted by federal law enforcement.  John Sankus, Jr., age 28, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, co-leader of one of the oldest organized software piracy groups on the Internet, pled guilty this morning before U.S. District Court Judge Leonie M. Brinkema to one felony count of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement.  Sankus, who will be sentenced on May 17, 2002, at 9:00 am,  could receive a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.
Sankus was the co-leader of an international Internet software piracy group known as DrinkOrDie.  DrinkOrDie engaged in the illegal distribution of copyrighted software, games and movies over the Internet, specializing in being the first to release high-end software applications and utilities.  DrinkOrDie is one of many highly structured, security conscious organizations that illegally reproduce and distribute hundreds of thousands of copies of copyrighted works around the world worth billions of dollars in losses each year.  Members rarely meet in person and frequently only know each other through their screen nicknames.
U.S. Attorney Paul J. McNulty said, "This is a crime against the integrity of our electronic infrastructure.  It is imperative that we stop these "techno-gangs" from exploiting new technologies for criminal purposes.  This plea is another significant step in our effort to eliminate intellectual property crime on the Internet and to make it safe for individuals and businesses to develop and use new software and technologies".  As part of the plea agreement, the United States and Sankus agreed that the amount of damage attributable to the defendant's actions, during the period charged, exceeds $2.5 million but is less than $5 million.
As co-leader of DrinkOrDie, Sankus was principally responsible for the management and supervision of the day-to-day operations of the criminal enterprise.  Sankus supervised approximately 60 individuals who acquired, cracked, and distributed ("released")  the pirated software.  Company  insiders ("suppliers") often provided the group with new software, frequently days or weeks before the software would be released to the general public.  Group members known as "crackers" would defeat the software's embedded copyright protections, allowing the software to be illegally reproduced and used by anyone obtaining a copy.  The finished product was then quickly distributed to sites located throughout the world for further distribution to an ever-expanding web of sites.  Within hours, a new release could be found on hundreds of illegal sites throughout the world.
DrinkorDie concealed these sites and conducted business in closed invite-only Internet relay chat channels.  Sankus and other high ranking members of DrinkOrDie used encryption to conceal all e-mails discussing the group's illegal activities.  "John Sankus and his group knew what they were doing was illegal and they took every technological step possible to conceal their activity," said McNulty.
DrinkOrDie was the primary group targeted by "Operation Buccaneer," a 15-month undercover investigation by the United States Customs Service with assistance from the Department of Justice's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) and the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.
On December 11th, the primary investigative phase of Operation Buccaneer culminated in the simultaneous execution worldwide of over 70 search warrants against targets of the investigation.  To date, warrants and/or arrests have been executed in the United States, Australia, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Finland.  Numerous targets of the investigation were arrested and taken into custody in the United Kingdom and investigations are currently ongoing in each of these countries. "Operation Buccaneer brought to light the severity and scope of a multi-billion-dollar software swindle perpetrated over the Internet," said U.S. Customs Commissioner Robert C. Bonner.  "This investigation is the first of several cases by the U.S. Customs Service to dismantle the top groups engaged in this illegal Marty Stansell-Gamm, Chief of CCIPS, said, "The Internet makes it essential for law enforcement to cooperate across international borders in order to effectively target all members of these warez groups.  Operation Buccaneer is an excellent example of how international cooperation can result in effective criminal enforcement on a global scale. We are committed to protecting the intellectual property rights of this country and will continue to work diligently, both here and abroad, to investigate and prosecute those individuals and groups who traffic in pirated products."
In addition to the plea agreement entered this morning, the United States Attorney expects additional prosecutions in the Eastern District of Virginia as a result of the first phase of Operation Buccaneer.  Assistant United States Attorney Robert Wiechering, Michael DuBose, Senior Counsel, CCIPS, and Michael O'Leary, Trial Attorney, CCIPS, are prosecuting the case for the United States.
Further questions may be directed to the United States Attorney's Office.

I'm writing an article on government agencies (perhaps corporations too) that rewrite their web sites to remove embarassing references after some embarrassing news happens. It's history revisionism, writ small.
For example, a hypothetical bureaucrat may remove embarassing references from her online bio ("Intern for Rep. Gary Condit"). Government agencies may rewrite official transcripts to delete embarassing flubs by officials.

The Martin-Schulman paper:
PrivSec's free SafeWeb-licensed service: (username: demo, password: secure)
   SafeWeb's Holes Contradict Claims
   By Declan McCullagh (declan
   12:35 p.m. Feb. 12, 2002 PST
   WASHINGTON -- SafeWeb's anonymous-surfing technology turns out not to
   be very safe after all.
   A pair of researchers has unearthed flaws in the CIA-funded product
   that contradict the company's claims of "complete privacy" and reveal
   the supposedly confidential information of customers.
   Founded in April 2000, SafeWeb marketed an advertising-supported
   service said to allow users to browse the Web anonymously. In
   interviews, SafeWeb CEO Jon Chun boasted that the technology had been
   "through the rigors of the CIA's stringent review process, which far
   exceeds those of the ordinary enterprise client."
   Citing the economic downturn, SafeWeb abandoned the free service in
   November 2001. It has licensed its anonymizing technology to another
   company, PrivaSec, which currently offers the service for free and
   plans to charge for it soon.
   In a paper (PDF) released on Tuesday, David Martin, a Boston
   University computer scientist, and Andrew Schulman of the Privacy
   Foundation say that SafeWeb's assertions were more hopeful than true.
   They say, and SafeWeb has acknowledged, that flaws in the company's
   architecture allow a website to use JavaScript to obtain the concealed
   Internet address of the visitor. Because of SafeWeb's centralized
   technology, that page can also download a browser's cookies and obtain
   copies of subsequent Web pages visited during that session.

If you don't like it, switch to another mail service that does not filter. Last I checked, canada.com's mail service was free. If I ran it, I'd probably do the same thing.
About the only legitimate complaint you have, assuming canada.com discloses in the TOS, is that the filtering is overbroad. In a few years of experience with canada.com, I have found it to snare only spam.

     conference -- or didn't want to pay the $535 to $685 conference fee
     -- but happen to be in the area, join us!
     The current plan is to meet on Tuesday, April 16 at 7:30 pm inside
     the conference hotel, the Cathedral Hill Hotel, in the Hilltop
     Grill and Bar. That's immediately on the left as you walk into the
     hotel. Then we'll head out to -- tentatively, assuming we don't
     have too many people -- a Thai or Vietnamese restaurant about two
     blocks away. Check this page or the Politech mailing list for
     confirmation after there's a head count of RSVPs and a restaurant
     reservation.
     Since April 16 is the day of the pre-conference tutorials -- that
     is, the day before the conference officially begins -- it seems to
     be the best choice for a gathering. EFF and Privacy International
     have events planned Wednesday and Thursday evenings, followed soon
     after by Birds of a Feather sessions -- and Friday is out since
     non-locals tend to leave after the 5 pm scheduled end of the
     conference.
     This gathering follows Politech dinners in San Francisco in 1999
     and (with the help of John Gilmore) in 1998, and occasional
     gatherings in Washington, DC, such as a November 2001 informal talk
     by Ian Clarke. A brief mention of the possibility of a gathering at
     CFP 2002 drew a strong response; this is the result.
  Summary
     Where: Cathedral Hill Hotel, 1101 Van Ness Ave (corner of Geary
     Blvd) in San Francisco, at the Hilltop Grill and Bar in the main
     lobby.
     How to get there: The hotel's website gives directions and a map.
     Mapquest's directions are another option. If you get lost, the
     hotel phone number is (415) 776-8200.
     When: Tuesday, April 16 at 7:30 pm PT.
     If you're planning to come, please email me at declan
     with "CFP" in the Subject: line, so I can make reservations and
     make sure the restaurant is large enough to accomodate us. Check
     back for details, including the name of the restaurant, a week
     before the gathering. See you there!

But there seem to be a few practical problems:

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
THURSDAY, MARCH 28, 2002
(202) 514-2007
TDD (202) 514-1888
COURT APPROVES IRS SUMMONS FOR OFFSHORE CREDIT CARD  RECORDS Records from VISA International Will Identify People Who Use Offshore Credit Cards to Evade Federal Income Taxes WASHINGTON, D.C.  - A federal court in San Francisco, Calif. on Wednesday issued an order authorizing the IRS to serve a summons on VISA International for offshore credit card records.  The court acted just two days after the Justice Department filed a petition for approval of a "John Doe" summons, which permits the IRS to obtain information about possible tax fraud by people whose identities are unknown.
The information expected in response to the summons will help the IRS identify people who use offshore accounts to evade their United States income tax liabilities.  The IRS suspects people have been committing tax fraud by diverting income and assets overseas and spending the money in the United States by using credit, charge or debit cards issued by banks in more than 30 countries, including Switzerland, Isle of Mann, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Singapore, Panama, Bermuda and numerous Caribbean nations.  The summons approved by the court will seek information including names, addresses, social security numbers, and telephone numbers of the VISA cardholders.
"The IRS believes that people using offshore accounts are evading billions of dollars per year in United States taxes," said Eileen J. O'Connor, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Tax Division. "We are pleased with the court's order which enables us to find the taxpayers who maintain offshore accounts to evade taxes.  We will use this information to enforce the tax laws."
In response to a similar suit filed in Miami, MasterCard has already produced over 1.7 million records, involving over 230,000 accounts, in response to a John Doe summons. American Express earlier this week agreed to turn over records relating to people who may be subject to United States income taxes and who have credit card accounts with addresses in Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas or the Cayman Islands. According to the IRS, that information will be used in civil audits and criminal investigations. The IRS estimates that the U.S. Treasury loses billions of dollars in annual tax revenue as a result of tax fraud committed by people with offshore bank accounts. # # # 02-188

3. Public support for federal workers falls to pre-Sept. 11 level
By Brian Friel
Americans support federal workers and trust the government less today than they did immediately after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a new survey shows.
The survey, issued Thursday by the Brookings Institution's Center for Public Service, found that support for federal workers had fallen to its pre-Sept. 11 level. The percentage of Americans who said they had a favorable opinion of federal workers fell from 76 percent in October 2001 to 69 percent this month, the same percentage that reported a favorable opinion in July 2001.
The percentage of Americans who said they trust the federal government to do what is right just about always or most of the time fell from 57 percent in October 2001 to 40 percent this month. In July 2001, 29 percent of survey respondents said they had high levels of trust in the government.

I'm a bit late here, but let me rise to the defense of profiling of this
sort. The reason we have interest rates on credit cards which are not
far higher than they are now and have ready availability of credit in the
first place (not to mention credit cards being accepted nearly everywhere)
is anti-fraud measures like automated profiling. In other words, it's
something that benefits the consumer by keeping costs down.
Yes, it can go too far and be intrusive. This would seem to be a place
where the market could respond if people care sufficiently; perhaps my
credit union-issued card would not flag purchases unless they were over
$5,000 or so. Or perhaps someone who cares enough to avoid the hassles
would pay in cash or check.
This analysis, of course, ignores that some of the push toward record
keeping on the part of businesses comes not just from market pressure,
but political pressure. USA PATRIOT expands dramatically police access
to credit card databases. And if Visa/MC/AMEX don't comply, perhaps
the tax code might be adjusted in a certain harmful way, or perhaps
they'll be accused of harboring terrorists, or perhaps the feds will
stop using their cards for purchases...

In the name of protecting their business model, the MPAA
proposes that every analog/digital (A/D) converter - one of
the most basic of chips - be required to check for US
government mandated copyright flags. Quite aside from
increasing the cost and complexity of the devices many,
manyfold, it eliminates the ability of the US to compete
in the world electronics market.
If this level of ignorance, chuptza, and bloodymindedness
had been around a hundred years ago, cars would be
forbidden to have a range greater then 20 miles, to
protect the railway industry, and transoceanic airline
tickets would have a $1000/seat surcharge, to compensate
the owners of ocean liners for lost revenue.

Hollywood Wants to Plug the "Analog Hole"
*New MPAA report reveals chilling agenda*
=The Big Picture=
The people who tried to take away your VCR are at it again. Hollywood has always dreamed of a "well-mannered marketplace" where the only technologies that you can buy are those that do not disrupt its business. Acting through legislators who dance to Hollywood's tune, the movie studios are racing to lock away the flexible, general-purpose technology that has given us a century of unparalelled prosperity and innovation.
The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) filed the "Content Protection Status Report" with the Senate Judiciary Committee last month, laying out its plan to remake the technology world to suit its own ends. The report calls for regulation of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), generic computing components found in scientific, medical and entertainment devices. Under its proposal, every ADC will be controlled by a "cop-chip" that will shut it down if it is asked to assist in converting copyrighted material -- your cellphone would refuse to transmit your voice if you wandered too close to the copyrighted music coming from your stereo.
The report shows that this ADC regulation is part of a larger agenda. The first piece of that agenda, a mandate that would give Hollywood a veto over digital television technology, is weeks away from coming to fruition. Hollywood also proposes a radical redesign of the Internet to assist in controlling the distribution of copyrighted works.
This three-part agenda -- controlling digital media devices, controlling analog converters, controlling the Internet -- is a frightening peek at Hollywood's vision of the future.
=Hollywood Tips its Hand=
The "Content Protection Status Report" ( points to future where innovation and fair use rights are sacrificed on copyright's altar, where entertainment companies become *de facto* regulators of new technologies, deciding which mathematical instructions are mandatory and which are forbidden.
The first part of the document details the efforts of the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group (BPDG:  which will release its final standard for the regulation of digital media technology at the end of May. The BPDG's standard would ban the production of digital television devices that had not been approved by three Hollywood studios. Approved devices will only interoperate with other approved devices. The combination of legal restrictions on digital television devices and licensing restrictions on the computer technologies they can interface with gives Hollywood an absolute veto over all new digital media technology without the need for unpopular, sweeping legislation like Senator Hollings's Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act (CBDTPA).
=Plugging the Analog Hole=
But the most disturbing pieces of the Status Report comes later in the document. The second section, "Plugging the Analog Hole," reveals Hollywood's plan to turn a generic technology component, the humble analog-to-digital convertor, into a device that is subject to the kind of regulation heretofore reserved for Schedule A narcotics.
Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are the building blocks of modern digital technology. An ADC's job is to take samples of the strength (amplitude) of some analog signal (light, sound, motion, temperature) at some interval (frequency) and convert the results to a numerical value. ADCs are embedded in digital scanners, samplers, thermometers, seismographs, mice and other pointer devices, camcorders, cameras, microscopes, telescopes, modems, radios, televisions, cellular phones, walkie-talkies, light-meters and a multitude of other devices. In general, ADCs are generic and interchangeable -- that is, a high-frequency ADC from a sound-card is potentially the same ADC that you'll find in a sensitive graphics tablet.
Hollywood perceives ADCs as the lynchpin of unauthorized duplication. No matter how much copy-control technology is integrated into DVDs and satellite broadcasts, there is always the possibility that some Internet user will aim a camcorder at the screen, always the shadowy fan at the concert wielding a smuggled digital recorder, always the audiophile jacking a low-impedance cable into a high-end stereo. These bogeymen plague Hollywood, and each one uses an ADC to produce unauthorized copies.
Accordingly, the report calls for a regimen where "watermark detectors would be required in all devices that perform analog to digital conversions." The plan is to embed a "watermark" (a theoretical, invisible mark that can only be detected by special equipment and that can't be removed without damaging the media in which it was embedded) in all copyrighted works. Thereafter, every ADC would be accompanied by a "cop chip" that would sense this watermark's presence and disable certain features depending on the conditions.
This is meant to work like so: You point your camcorder at a movie screen. The magical, theoretical watermark embedded in the film is picked up by the cop-chip, which disables the camcorder's ADC. Your camcorder records nothing but dead air. The mic, sensing a watermark in the film's soundtrack, also shuts itself down.
The objective of a law like this is to make "unauthorized" synonymous with "illegal." In the world of copyright, there are many uses that are legal, even -- *especially* -- if they are unauthorized, for example, the fair-use right to quote a work for critical purposes. Any critic -- a professor, a reporter, even an individual with a personal website -- may be lawfully copy parts of copyrighted works in a critical discussion. Such a person may scan in part of a magazine article, record a snatch of music from a CD or a piece of a film or television show in the lawful course of making a critical work.
And you don't need to be a critic to make a lawful, unauthorized copy! You might be someone who wants to "format-shift" some personal property -- say, by scanning in a book or transferring an old LP to MP3 so that you might take it with you while travelling with your computer. This is absolutely lawful, but under the "analog hole" proposal, providing the tools to make such unauthorized uses would be illegal.
=Unintended Consequences=
It's outrageous that Hollywood would demand a law that intentionally breaks technology so that it can't be used in lawful ways, but the unintended consequences of this regime are even more bizarre.
Virtually everything in our world is copyrighted or trademarked by someone, from the facades of famous sky-scrapers to the background music local mall. If ADCs are constrained from performing analog-to-digital conversion of all watermarked copyrighted works, you might end up with a cellphone that switches itself off when you get within range of the copyrighted music on your stereo; a camcorder that refuses to store your child's first steps because he is taking them within eyeshot of a television playing a copyrighted cartoon; a camera that won't snap your holiday moments if they take place against the copyrighted backdrop of a chain store such as Starbucks, which forbids on-premises photography because its fixtures are proprietary works.
As was mentioned, ADCs are fundamental, generic computing components, found in medical and scientific equipment, computers, and a variety of consumer electronics. Surely Hollywood doesn't mean to suggest that geologists will have to equip their seismographs with cop-chips (lest they should accidentally record a copyrighted earthquake)?
It seems likely that they do. The primary difference between most ADCs is the frequency at which they run. Two ADCs of like frequency and bitrate can be interchanged. If any "free" ADCs are allowed into the marketplace, they will surely find themselves repurposed in camcorders, samplers, and scanners (oh my!).
=The Scourge of P2P=
Hollywood's report to Congress includes its third legislative goal: "Putting an end to the avalanche of movie theft on so-called 'file-sharing' services, such as Morpheus, Gnutella, and other peer-to-peer (p2p) networks."
Here, rather than making "unauthorized" and "illegal" synonymous, Hollywood is seeking to overturn the Betamax doctrine -- the principle that a technology is legal, provided that it can be used to accomplish legal ends. VCRs are legal, even though they can be used to make illegal copies of copyrighted works, because they can *also* be used to make legal copies of personal works and copyrighted works (in the case of time- and P2P networks -- such as the Internet -- are not infringing in and of themselves. "P2P" describes a technology where the system's control is largely or entirely decentralized. P2P application networks are turned to all manner of ends, from sharing classroom materials and independently produced media to distributing large scientific problems associated with the search for a cure for AIDS to providing a distributed proxy service that allows Chinese Internet users to circumvent China's national firewall and read uncensored news. True, they can also be used to make unauthorized

Jim Bell update: Way back in the 1980s, entrepreneur Jim Bell owned a
    company that sold computer storage devices.
    Now Bell works in a California prison, demolishing computers and their
    monitors at the handsome wage of 46 cents an hour. "I've taken a day
    job destroying computer monitors," Bell said in a phone call from
    prison this week. "I've gone through about 100 so far."
    Bell is the infamous author of Assassination Politics, an essay that
    discusses ways to eliminate bothersome IRS agents. That captured the
    attention of the feds, who charged him with stalking federal agents.
    Last year, a jury found Bell guilty and he's been sentenced (PDF) to
    10 years.
    Bell says that it's easy to destroy a monitor without making it
    implode. "That almost never is impressive, particularly if you do it
    right," he says. "There's a little nib at the end of the CRT that if
    you hit it just right with the hammer it creates a small hiss. There's
    an ooomph if someone drops the monitor, but other than that it's
    pretty innocuous."
    He gets paid by Unicorp, the Justice Department-affiliated business
    that markets prison labor to federal agencies. Eventually, Bell says,
    he'll be making $1.07 an hour. "Some day."

    RIAA talks tough on Web radio copying

    WASHINGTON--The Recording Industry Association of America said
    Wednesday that it has begun pressing for anti-copying technology in
    future digital radio standards.
    Mitch Glazier, the association's top lobbyist, said the RIAA is
    contacting IT and consumer electronics groups to ask them to consider
    a "broadcast flag" for digital music sent through the Internet,
    satellite or cable.

    The idea is straightforward: Future hardware and software would treat
    music differently if it were designated as broadcast-only, preventing
    users from saving it or uploading it. Currently programs like
    StreamRipper or StreamCatcher can record streaming music distributed
    through Webcasting.
    But because people might not use these new kinds of music receivers if
    given a choice, new federal laws likely would be necessary to compel
    software and hardware manufacturers to abide by the broadcast-only
    designation.

1. Government creates new Washington evacuation plan
By Jason Peckenpaugh
The federal government has created a new procedure for evacuating federal employees in Washington in the case of possible terrorist attacks on the nation's capital.
The protocol, which took effect in May, tells who can decide to evacuate federal employees from agencies and how the government will communicate the decision to employees and to city and state agencies that would be affected by a mass exodus of civil servants from Washington. It is an attempt to improve on the ad hoc process used on Sept. 11, when the Office of Personnel Management closed federal agencies without first notifying state and transit officials in the Washington area.
"Basically the only emergency plan that was available that this area had [on Sept. 11] was the snow emergency plan," said Scott Hatch, OPM's director of communications. The new protocol was designed to handle federal evacuations in Washington, but could be used to make evacuation decisions for civil servants in other cities, he said.

   White House preps cybersecurity plan
   By Declan McCullagh    September 16, 2002, 6:58 PM PT
   WASHINGTON--The White House's cyberspace security plan, scheduled to
   be released Wednesday, envisions a broad new role for the federal
   government in maintaining Internet security.    While couching many concepts as mere suggestions, a draft of the plan
   seen by CNET News.com says the government should improve the security
   of key Internet protocols and spend tens of millions of dollars on
   centers to recognize and respond to "cyber attacks."
   [...]
   It says the executive branch should consult with privacy groups and
   attempt to preserve civil liberties, but concludes that in some cases,
   privacy could be limited. "Allowing completely anonymous
   communications on a wide-scale basis, with no possibility of
   determining the source, could shelter criminal, or even terrorist
   communications," the draft says.

See also:
Privacy Villain of the Week:
DARPA's HumanID at a Distance
The Defense Advance Research Projects Agency  has been one of the more fruitful government agenies in the past, its DARPAnet computer network being the foundation for what would become the Internet some years later. That is why reading about what this outfit is up to now can at times be disheartening. One such project is the HumanID at a Distance program, which aims to move beyond face-recognition technology and purportedly identify people by the way the walk.
The idea here is that by measuring with video or (clothes-penetrating) radar the distance between, say, 17 different points on the body  and measuring how these points move in relation to one another, a person can be positively and uniquely identified.
This "gait technology" by itself is neutral of course, just as technologies such as a gun or a needle or or the banging of flint against stone. The problem here arises in that by funding such research, the government is pushing a technology on society that it has not freely accepted through the voluntary choices made in the market. A patina of legitimacy is unfortunately added to such technologies when they have the imprimatur of the state behind them.
Even when the lead researchers on the project issue a press release  with conflictuing estimations of accuracy ranging from .0001% to 95%.
These selfsame researchers go on to tout the tech for use "around federal buildings" and in airports (which have now had their security systems completely taken over by the federal government). The airport situation is particularly troubling, in that it would be installed after the new Transportation Security Agency has complete control of all US airports. Adding the full-body radar scans that are part of a gait-biometric system to their CAPPS database incorporating name, Social Security number, credit history, travel history, etc., is a small step. This would be another peice of information in a federal database left wide open to abuse by not only those with official and unofficial clearance but anyone who bribes or hacks their way in.
In addition, the potential for false positives seems to be overwhelming. Even if the number is closer to 95% than .001%, what happens when a heavy piece of luggage and lack of sleep slumps the shoulders enough to peg a weary traveler as a dangerous terrorist? Is he or she strip-searched and detained by armed federal employees while the plane to his mother's funeral leaves for the other coast? This kind of technological forcing, especially in situations controlled by the state, puts individuals in a position where, due to lack of adequate societal knowledge, individuals are unable to control the kind of information being disseminated about themselves.
Identification technology has its uses. But when government forces it on everyone, from a Social Security number onward, the long-term effects are net negative -- oversurveillance , undersecurity, identity theft, etc. DARPA scientists and their colleagues at places like Carnegie Mellon  and Georgia Tech may be taking great strides forward -- but do they recignize where to, or why this may earn them the title of Privacy Villain of the Week?

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                      January 21, 2003
             New White House Office Coordinates Global Communications
The President understands the importance of conveying America
's message to the
world. Better coordination of our international communications will help convey
the truth about America and the goals we share with people everywhere. He knows
we need to communicate our policies and values to the world ? with greater
clarity and through dialogue with emerging voices around the globe. Created by
Executive Order of the President, this new office within the White House
coordinates strategic communications with global audiences, integrating the
President's themes into new and ongoing programs.
The New Office of Global Communications
The Office of Global Communications (OGC) advises on the strategic direction and
themes that United States government agencies use to reach foreign audiences.
The Office assists in the development of communications programs that
disseminate truthful, accurate, and effective messages about the American and their government. With State Department Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs
remaining at the frontlines of international communications, Global
Communications coordinates the work of many agencies and Americans to convey a
few simple but powerful messages. These will be aimed to prevent
misunderstanding and conflict, build support for and among United States
coalition partners, and better inform international audiences.
Lessons learned from the temporary Coalition Information Centers (CIC) have applied to the new Office. Created to react to our adversaries' misinformation,
CIC quickly proved that White House-led efforts could facilitate strategic,
proactive communications in the war on terror. Last year's focus on the
liberation of women in Afghanistan is a prime example. Working closely with the
communications office of the Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs, Global Communications recently coordinated communications about the
Administration's Ramadan activity and the President's views on Islam.
Recognizing the value of remotely deployed coalition information centers, the
President has authorized the new Office to coordinate with the appropriate
agencies the creation of teams of communicators to work in areas of intense
global media interest. No such team is currently operating, but OGC is to move swiftly in cooperation with other US government agencies and coalition

More than that, in fact, they'll argue that it's necessary. I suspect
much of this comes from the reward structure of grad programs in CS (and
I presume other disciplines), where you win if you get DARPA etc. grants.

The limitation to international terrorism in existing law is an impediment to the effective use of national security letters because it may not be apparent in the early stages of a terrorism investigation-or even after it has continued for some time-whether domestic or international terrorism is involved. The Oklahoma City bombing and the anthrax letter incidents illustrate this point. Moreover, in the current circumstances, domestic terrorists who attempt to ally with or are inspired to emulate international terrorists are an increasing concern. The dangers posed to the national security by such persons may be comparable to those posed by international terrorists, and national security letters should likewise be an available tool in the investigation of their criminal activities.

While we're on this topic, some Supreme Court cases...
This is an indictment under the Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, c. 30,
tit. 1, 3, 40 Stat. 219, as amended by the Act of May 16, 1918, c. 75,
1, 40 Stat. 553 (Comp. St. 1918, 10212c). It has been cut down to two
counts, originally the third and fourth. The former of these alleges
that on or about June 16, 1918, at Canton, Ohio, the defendant caused
and incited and attempted to cause and incite insubordination,
disloyalty, mutiny and refusal of duty in the military and naval
forces of the United States and with intent so to do delivered, to an
assembly of people, a public speech, set forth. The fourth count
alleges that he obstructed and attempted to obstruct the recruiting
and enlistment service of the United States and to that end and with
that intent delivered the same speech, again set forth. [conviction upheld]
Petitioner's remark during political debate at small public gathering
that if inducted into Army (which he vowed would never occur) and made
to carry a rifle "the first man I want to get in my sights is
L. B. J.," held to be crude political hyperbole which in light of its
context and conditional nature did not constitute a knowing and
willful threat against the President within the coverage of 18 U.S.C. 871 (a).
Appellant, a Ku Klux Klan leader, was convicted under the Ohio
Criminal Syndicalism statute for "advocat[ing] . . . the duty,
necessity, or propriety of crime, sabotage, violence, or unlawful
methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or
political reform" and for "voluntarily assembl[ing] with any society,
group or assemblage of persons formed to teach or advocate the
doctrines of criminal syndicalism." Neither the indictment nor the
trial judge's instructions refined the statute's definition of the
crime in terms of mere advocacy not distinguished from incitement to
imminent lawless action. Held: Since the statute, by its words and as
applied, purports to punish mere advocacy and to forbid, on pain of
criminal punishment, assembly with others merely to advocate the
described type of action, it falls within the condemnation of the
First and Fourteenth Amendments. Freedoms of speech and press do not
permit a State to forbid advocacy of the use of force or of law
violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or
producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce
such action. Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357 , overruled.
Appellant was convicted of violating that part of Cal. Penal Code 415
which prohibits "maliciously and willfully disturb[ing] the peace or
quiet of any neighborhood or person . . . by . . . offensive conduct,"

"offensive conduct" means "behavior which has a tendency to provoke
others to acts of violence or to in turn disturb the peace," and
affirmed the conviction. Held: Absent a more particularized and

display of this single four-letter expletive a criminal

I received a phone call today from a newspaper reporter who's writing an article on mattd/proffr and wanted background on the cypherpunks group or movement, as he put it. The reporter -- who covers crime, law enforcement, and the courts -- wanted to know whether mattd/proffr was representative of the group or an outlier, and stressed that two other cypherpunks have been imprisoned for their actions in this area.
Apparently mattd/proffr has been saying on cypherpunks that some federal prosecutors need killing. Then that post was indexed by Google, and now it is a prominent hit for the name of said prosecutor. (I say apparently because, thanks to the good graces of procmail, I haven't read any mattd/proffr posts in ages. This is what I gathered solely from the phone Anyway, the Feds apparently are neither confirming nor denying that an investigation is in progress, except to say that they are "aware" of mattd/proffr's post.
This is what I learned from the phone call. I have no firsthand knowledge.

COMMERCE UNDER SECRETARY ROGAN TO OPEN USPTO/WIPO CONFERENCE EXPLORING
              USE OF GEOGRAPHIC NAMES TO DESCRIBE FOOD AND WINE
        Use of Terms Bologna, Parmesan, Chablis, and Burgundy Could Be
         Prohibited, Adversely Affecting U.S. Food and Wine Industry
   Wednesday, July 9, 2003
9:30 a.m.
   The Palace Hotel
   2 New Montgomery Street
   San Francisco, CA.
Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property James E. Rogan will
make opening remarks at a three-day symposium (July 9-11) on the use of
geographical indications (GIs) to describe food and wine.  The symposium,
which is being co-hosted by the Department of Commercebs U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) and the World Intellectual Property Organization
(WIPO), will feature an international array of experts in the field from
WIPO member states and the food and wine industries.  The symposium is
being held in anticipation of a World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting on
GIs scheduled for Cancun, Mexico in September.  It is expected that at the
Cancun meeting, the European Union will call for terminating the use of
certain generic terms to describe food and wine unless those products come
from a specific geographic region.  If the EU is successful, use of terms
such as feta and gorgonzola for cheese, and port and sherry for wine - now
considered generic in many WTO member nations - could be prohibited in the
United States, resulting in consumer confusion and potentially injuring
U.S. domestic and international commerce in food and wine.

The development of digital money, and encryption software restricting government's ability to monitor Internet activity, are common goals among the online anarchists and libertarians known as "cypherpunks."
The ultimate purpose of Assassination Politics is to deter people from working for government agencies, corporate media outlets or institutions "beholden to the violence of the state," Taylor said.
Professor Rat also has threatened a University of Ottawa law professor, a columnist for The Boston Globe and a Cincinnati police officer.
The Post is withholding the names of the subjects of posts by Professor Rat to avoid promoting any specific threats.
Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California-Los Angeles and a First Amendment specialist, said the threats were probably criminal, given Taylor's description of the purpose of Assassination Politics.

Previous Politech messages:
"John Gilmore's suit over secret FAA regs in SF court on 1/17"
"John Gilmore sues Feds over secret your-papers-please rule"
And here's an article I wrote seven years ago about John:
Your readers already know about my opposition to useless airport
security crap.  I'm suing John Ashcroft, two airlines, and various
other agencies over making people show IDs to fly -- an intrusive
measure that provides no security.  (See But I would be hard pressed to come up with a security measure more
useless and intrusive than turning a plane around because of a
political button on someone's lapel.
My sweetheart Annie and I tried to fly to London today (Friday) on
British Airways.  We started at SFO, showed our passports and got
through all the rigamarole, and were seated on the plane while it
taxied out toward takeoff.  Suddenly a flight steward, Cabin Service
Director Khaleel Miyan, loomed in front of me and demanded that I
remove a small 1" button pinned to my left lapel.  I declined, saying
that it was a political statement and that he had no right to censor
passengers' political speech.  The button, which was created by
political activist Emi Koyama, says "Suspected Terrorist".  Large
images of the button and I appear in the cover story of Reason
Magazine this month, and the story is entitled "Suspected Terrorist".
You can see the button at:
   (Reason hasn't put the current issue online yet, for some reason.)
The steward returned with Capt. Peter Hughes.  The captain requested,
and then demanded, that I remove the button (they called it a
"badge").  He said that I would endanger the aircraft and commit a
federal crime if I did not take it off.  I told him that it was a
political statement and declined to remove it.
They turned the plane around and brought it back to the gate, delaying
300 passengers on a full flight.
We were met at the jetway by Carol Spear, Station Manager for BA at
SFO.  She stated that since the captain had told her he was refusing
to transport me as a passenger, she had no other course but to take me
off the plane.  I offered no resistance.  I reminded her of the court
case that United lost when their captain removed a Middle Eastern man
who had done nothing wrong, merely because "he made me uncomfortable".
She said that she had no choice but to uphold the captain and that we
could sort it out in court later, if necessary.  She said that my
button was in "poor taste".
Later, after consulting with (unspecified) security people, Carol said
that if we wanted to fly on the second and last flight of the day, we
would be required to remove the button and put it into our checked
luggage (or give it to her).  And also, our hand-carried baggage would
have to be searched to make sure that we didn't carry any more of
these terrorist buttons onto the flight and put them on, endangering
the mental states of the passengers and crew.
I said that I understood that she had refused me passage on the first
flight because the captain had refused to carry me, but I didn't
understand why I was being refused passage on the second one.  I
suggested that BA might have captains with different opinions about
free speech, and that I'd be happy to talk with the second captain to
see if he would carry me.  She said that the captain was too busy to
talk with me, and that speaking broadly, she didn't think BA had any
captains who would allow someone on a flight wearing a button that
said "Suspected Terrorist".  She said that BA has discretion to
decline to fly anyone.  (And here I had thought they were a common
carrier, obliged to carry anyone who'll pay the fare, without
discrimination.)  She said that passengers and crew are nervous about
terrorism and that mentioning it bothers them, and that is grounds to
exclude me.  I suggested that if they wanted to exclude mentions of
terrorists from the airplane, then they should remove all the
newspapers from it too.
I asked whether I would be permitted to fly if I wore other buttons,
perhaps one saying "Hooray for Tony Blair".  She said she thought that
would be OK.  I said, how about "Terrorism is Evil".  She said that I
probably wouldn't get on.  I started to discuss other possible
buttons, like "Oppose Terrorism", trying to figure out what kinds of
political speech I would be permitted to express in a BA plane, but
she said that we could stand there making hypotheticals all night and
she wasn't interested.  Ultimately, I was refused passage because
I would not censor myself at her command.
After the whole interaction was over, I offered to tell her, just for
her own information, what the button means and why I wear it.  She was
curious.  I told her that it refers to all of us, everyone, being
suspected of being terrorists, being searched without cause, being
queued in lines and pens, forced to take our shoes off, to identify
ourselves, to drink our own breast milk, to submit to indignities.
Everyone is a suspected terrorist in today's America, including all
the innocent people, and that's wrong.  That's what it means.  The
terrorists have won if we turn our country into an authoritarian
theocracy "to defeat terrorism".  I suggested that British Airways had
demonstrated that trend brilliantly today.  She understood but wasn't
sympathetic -- like most of the people whose individual actions are
turning the country into a police state.
Annie asked why she, Annie, was not allowed to fly.  She wasn't
wearing or carrying any objectionable buttons.  Carol said it's
because of her association with me.  I couldn't have put it better
myself -- guilt by association.  I asked whether Annie would have been
able to fly if she had checked in separately, and got no answer.
(Indeed it was I who pointed out to the crew that Annie and I were
traveling together, since we were seated about ten rows apart due to
the full flight.  I was afraid that they'd take me off the plane
without her even knowing.)
Annie later told me that the stewardess who had gone to fetch her said
that she thought the button was something that the security people had
made me wear to warn the flight crew that I was a suspected
terrorist(!).  Now that would be really secure.
I spoke with the passengers around me before being removed from the
plane, and none of them seemed to have any problem with sitting next
to me for 10 hours going to London.  None of them had even noticed the
button before the crew pointed it out, and none of them objected to it
after seeing it.  It was just the crew that had problems, as far as I
could tell.
PS: For those who know I don't fly in the US because of the ID demand:
I'm willing to show a passport to travel to another country.  I'm not
willing to show ID -- an "internal passport" -- to fly within my own

                           INTERVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT

                          TREVOR KAVANAGH OF "THE SUN"

                               November 14, 2003
9:31 A.M. EST
     THE PRESIDENT:  Have you ever been in the Oval Office before?
     Q    Once, just once --
     THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  The rug was designed by my wife.  Every President
gets to design his own rug.  You probably didn't know that.
     Q    Fabulous.
     THE PRESIDENT:  I wanted mine -- mine was designed by my wife, Laura.  And
I wanted people to have a sense of optimism  when they came in here, that this
is a guy who kind of sees a better world, not a worse world.  Sometimes the Oval
can be foreboding, and I wanted it to be cheery.  So I hope you felt that.
     This is called, "A Charge To Keep," it's based upon a Methodist hymn.  One
of America's great imports from England was John Wesley.  And it talks about
serving something greater than yourself, which speaks to my own personal faith;
as a President, it speaks to my need to capture the spirit of America and call
on people to serve.  You've probably followed some of my domestic policy, but
one of the things that's important is to call on people to serve their
communities by helping neighbors who hurt.   The de Tocquevillean view of
America at that point was just, kind of, a civic fabric of loving organizations;
part of my vision, as well, is to energize them.
     The paintings of Texas.  That's kind of what my ranch looks like, by a guy
named Onderdonk, he's a Texas landscape artist.  The blue bonnets are not quite
that big.  Blair and I -- well, he's been there, and he would recognize kind of
the look, if he were here.  This is West Texas, where my wife's family was
raised.  We were both raised in West Texas, but this is farther west than where
I was raised.  It's called El Paso.  But it's a famous Texas artist and
historian who painted that.
     More Texas.  The reason I have Texas up there is it's where I'm from.  And
in this job if you can't figure out who you are -- you better know who you are
because of the pressures and the decision making process and all the noise of
politics and all that (inaudible).
     Really quickly, this is a desk given to us by Queen Victoria.  A famous
desk called the HMS Resolute, and it's wood from the Resolute.  The door was put
on by Roosevelt to cover his infirmities.  Out of the door poked John Kennedy's
son --
     Q    Oh, yes, I remember.
     THE PRESIDENT:  I chose to use this -- Ronald Reagan put the bottom on to
make the desk high so it won't bump your knees.  I love the desk.  I love its
history.  It does speak to the great relationship between America and Great
Britain, I'm sitting at a desk given to our country by Queen Victoria.
     And, finally, the Churchill bust is on loan from the Brits.  Tony Blair
knew I was a great admirer of Churchill, so here he sits, along with Lincoln and
     That's it, welcome.
     Q    Fantastic.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Where would you like
     THE PRESIDENT:  Sit right here, take Vice President Cheney's seat.
     Q    I'm more than a little impressed by being here and by sitting in this
     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, this is a shrine to democracy and we treat
it as such.  And it's an honor to serve here.
     Q    Well, I would like to thank you on behalf of our readers for giving
them and me the time to talk to you.
     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'm glad you're here, thanks.
     Q    We're a very pro-American newspaper, and our readers were shocked and
deeply moved by September the 11th.  And they supported what happened
subsequently in Afghanistan, and a little more reluctantly in Iraq, but, in
fact, the majority of our readers were behind the action.
     I think what they would like to know -- we've talked with them in a way
which is quite interesting, we actually spent a weekend with about 2,000 of our
     THE PRESIDENT:  Really?  (Laughter.)  Good marketing tool.  (Laughter.)
That's interesting.
     Q    Yes.  And the one question they wanted to ask you is, is the world a
safer place after the conflict than it was before?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, much safer.  It's safer for a couple of reasons.  One,
the free world has recognized the threat.  In order to make the world safe
you've got to actually see reality.  And the reality is that there are
cold-blooded killers who were trying to intimidate, create fear, create
hostility and to shape the will of the civilized world.
     And a lot of countries have seen the threat for what it is.  So, therefore,
step one is recognizing the problem.  Tony Blair recognizes the problem, Jose
Maria Aznar recognizes the problem, Silvio Berlusconi recognizes the problem --
clearly, the United States recognizes the problem, after all, the clearest
indication that we were at war and that the stakes had changed dramatically was
September the 11th.  After all, we were a country which was able to sit back in
our -- kind of in our geographical posture and pick and choose where a threat
might emerge and say, we may have to deal with that or we may not deal with it;
we were pretty confident that we were protected ourselves by oceans.  That
     And one of my vows to the American people is I won't forget the lessons of
September the 11th, 2001.
     Secondly, the world is safer because the actions we have taken will
ultimately strengthen multi-national institutions.  Take the theater in Iraq.
The United Nations had recognized that Saddam Hussein was a threat, they
recognized it in not one resolution, but multiple resolutions -- and, yet,
didn't do anything about it.  And, therefore, the resolutions became weak,
became just words.
     And as a result of enforcing 1441, which said that you disarm or there will
be serious consequences, now when multi-national institutions speak, hopefully,
people will take them seriously.  And in order to win the war on terror, there
needs to be alliance and cooperation.  Because these are killers that are
capable of hiding in societies, they're patient, they're lethal, they pop up and
will destroy.  And, by the way, they don't care who they destroy.  There are no
rules for these people, they will kill children just as soon as they'll kill
somebody in a military uniform.
     Thirdly, the world is safer because there is a -- and, by the way,
multi-national forum doesn't necessarily mean U.N.  It can also mean
collaborations, like the collaboration that's now taking place with North Korea
in dealing with Kim Jong-il, who is a threat to peace.  And now it's not just
the United States dealing with Kim Jong-il, it's the United States, China, South
Korea, Japan and Russia in a collaborative effort.  Or the fine work -- the
initial fine work done by the foreign ministers of Great Britain, France and
Germany in telling Iran to get rid of its nuclear ambitions.  I say "initial
fine work" because the Iranians, in the past, have had clandestine operations.
And, therefore, in order to make sure that the words that have been issued to
them are true, there must be transparency.
     Fourthly, we dealt al Qaeda.  We are tough on al Qaeda.  Now, you know,
there are key figures still looming in caves and remote regions of the world,
but we're dismantling them.  If you were to look at al Qaeda as a business
organization, middle management is no longer.  That's not to say that they're
not grooming junior executives to take over certain roles.  But we're tough and
we're on their trail and we're still hunting them down.  Make no mistake about
it.  And as a result of dismantling al Qaeda, the world is safer.
     We've also dealt with the tyrants in Afghanistan, which is an incredibly
dangerous regime -- dangerous not only to the free world because they provided
housing, training, money, safe haven -- but also they were just tortuous and
barbaric to their own people.  And in Iraq, Saddam Hussein was clearly a threat
to peace.  And we can argue about the definition of "serious consequence," and I
respect the debate, but no one can justify this man's behavior to his people.
We've discovered mass graves with over 300,000 people there, rape rooms and
torture rooms.  He is paying suiciders to go kill innocent Israelis.  He had a
weapons program as discovered -- I promise you this is going to be a short
answer, eventually; I saw you looking at the clock, your glance can't escape me.
     This is an important question.  It is the question.
     Q    Of course, absolutely.
     THE PRESIDENT:  David Kay discovered a weapons program that was in material
breach of 1441.  In other words, it was in violation of precisely what the
United Nations had asked him not to do.  Saddam Hussein, in 1991, it was assumed
that he -- his nuclear weapons program would be active in the out years and, in
fact, the inspectors discovered he's got nuclear ambitions, not only real and
active, but his program was a lot farther along than we thought.  And had he
ever developed a nuclear weapon, had he been allowed to have a nuclear weapon,
he would have been the ultimate source of international blackmail.
     And so the removal of Saddam Hussein makes the world safer.  And, as
importantly, the removal of Saddam Hussein gives the Iraqis a chance to live in
freedom, which is the ultimate -- freedom is the ultimate route to security.  I
strongly believe that free nations are peaceful nations.  Free nations are not
terrorist havens, do not become terrorist havens.  Free nations won't create
conditions of strife and resentment that breeds anxiety and terror.
     And, therefore, the world is becoming safer, is safer and will be even more
safe when Iraq becomes free.  And Iraq will be free, and it'll be peaceful.  And
we need peace and freedom in that part of the world.
     Now, there's an interesting debate going on as to whether or not people,
like the Iraqis, will ever adapt the habits of freedom.  There's kind of an
elitism that takes place -- in our country, in your country and elsewhere,
feels, well, certain people can't be free, they can't adapt the habits of
democracy.  I strongly disagree.  I strongly disagree.
     And so, yes, the world is safer and the world is more peaceful.
     Q    Okay.  That answer will resonate with our readers.  Nonetheless, there
is concern about the events, particularly in the last week or so, when things
have escalated.  I think this causes concern everywhere.  Are we going to
increase military presence there?  Are we going to pull out?  There's a fear
that --
     THE PRESIDENT:  You don't have to worry about us pulling out.
     Q    There's a famous t-shirt, slogan, which shows the American flag and
the words, "these colors don't run."  Do you stand by that?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Our will is being tested.
See, the tactics of the terrorists is to kill as many innocent people as
possible and, therefore, try to shape the will of the Iraqis.  As progress is
made -- and we're making interesting progress, and I'll cite some examples in a
minute that I think are fascinating.  But as the Iraqis begin to say, wait a
minute, life can be better, and their instincts kick in about what it means to
live in a free society, the terrorists want to shake that.  They want to scare
them.  They want the police not to become police.  And we've got over 118,000
people now, Iraqi citizens in uniform beginning to conduct operations for their
own security.
     They, of course, want to kill our own soldiers, and, therefore, try to
shake the will of the American people and the President and the command
structure.  They killed those Italians.  And they were hoping that Berlusconi
would say, oh, my goodness, this is too big a fight, we'll leave.  We're not
leaving.  We're staying there to get the job done.  Of course we mourn the death
of any citizen.  But I recognize that it is -- I still remember the death, what
happened to us on September the 11th, as well.  I was there at Ground Zero right
after the attacks and I remember this kind of haze and the smells and the death
and destruction.  I'll always remember that, of course.
     And, as I've told you, I vowed not to forget the lessons.
     Q    That changed everything?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Absolutely.  Look, what changed for me was sitting on Air
Force One and getting the reports that we were under attack.  And I made up my
mind then, right then, that we didn't need a bunch of legal briefs, I didn't
need a bunch of -- you know, let's kind of hold hands and hope to get the right
answer -- we were at war and we were going to win the war.  And I still feel
that same exact determination today that I did then.
     Q    So you'll stay in Iraq even --
     THE PRESIDENT:  We will do our job.
     Q    -- after there's an interim council, a government which is --
     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  There's a lot of talk right now about the political
process, as there should be.  And we are interested in the Iraqis assuming more
responsibility on the political side and on the security side.  And a political
process in which the Iraqis assume more responsibility will make the security
side come together quicker, as well, in our judgment.
     And, therefore, Bremer came here, he took instructions back from me to talk
to the Governing Council to find out what is feasible when it comes to the
passing of more power to the Governing Council.  That's where we are right
     On the security side, absolutely we're there.  The goal is for Iraq to be
peaceful and free.  I understand the consequences of a free and peaceful Iraq in
the midst of the Middle East.  We can have the debate all day long as to whether
the Middle East will ever adapt the habits of democracy and freedom.  I think
they will, obviously; and I'm confident they will.  I like to tell people in
this country, freedom is not America's gift to the world, freedom is not Great
Britain's gift to the world, Freedom is the Almighty's gift to everybody in the
     Q    And this is what you'll tell the demonstrators?  Or this is what you
would tell the demonstrators if you had five minutes with them?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Of course I would, absolutely.  I will say, you may
disagree with our tactics -- nobody likes war, war is my last choice -- if the
demonstrators are there as anti-war protestors; they may be there for other
reasons, as well, global trade, and I'd be glad to talk to them about that, as
well.  But in terms of war, I can understand why people are anxious about war.
I can understand why citizens in Great Britain, protestor or not, wonders about
why a President would commit to war.  Because nobody likes war.
     On the other hand, I would tell them, the skeptics and the critics, that I
have a job to protect the security of the United States of America, and that
Saddam Hussein was a security risk, as witnessed by the international community
speaking loudly on that subject 12 different times.  But I would tell those who
doubt our policy that we share a common goal, which is peace, and that free
societies are peaceful societies.  They may say, well, you can't possibly expect
a country like Iraq to be free -- and then we'd have an interesting,
philosophical debate, because I believe freedom exists in the heart of every
single human being.  It may take longer for people to accept freedom, if they've
been tortured and brutalized like Saddam Hussein did.
     Secondly, I would tell the skeptics that not only is the world more secure
as a result of the decisions we made, the Iraqi people now have a chance to live
in a society which is hopeful and optimistic, a society in which you're able to
speak your mind, a society in which you don't have to pay homage to a brutal
tyrant and his two brutal sons -- which is precisely how they had to live in the
     Q    So how do you respond to those people who were polled by the Europe
commission and found that America was alongside Iran, North Korea is the second
most powerful threat to world peace?
     THE PRESIDENT:  You just have to tell them watch what happens.  The world
is going to be more peaceful and the free world will be more secure as a result
of the decisions we've taken.
     Q    Can I ask you about the special relationship, the role the British
soldiers play in Iraq and are still playing?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.
     Q    Would you like to tell me about you feel about our contribution?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I'll tell you about your troops.  They are well
trained, they are well motivated and they're really good at what they do.  And
our soldiers and our generals and our commanders really appreciate being
side-by-side with the Brits.  They trust them, and that's important.
     Secondly, in Basra, the Brits have brought an interesting strategy in
dealing in Basra because you have dealt in Northern Ireland.  In other words, it
was kind of a transfer of experience that has been incredibly useful and
important.  I am really proud of our -- not only our alliance, because it's
close now and I intend to keep it that way.  I've got a great personal
relationship with Tony Blair.
     Let me tell you something about him just real quick, because it relates
also to the trust of the troops.  He's a man who comes in here and he says he's
going to do something, and as I said -- as they say in Texas, you can book him
when he says he's going to do something, you can take it to the bank.  Because
every time he has said something, he has done it, and I appreciate that a lot.
It's not always the way it is in politics -- whether it be domestic or
international politics.  Sometimes they'll come and look you in the eye and say,
"Oh, don't worry, Mr. President, we're with you and behind you," and it turns
out they're way behind you, you can't find them when the heat gets on.  But
that's not the way Tony Blair is, and that's not the way the Brits' command
structure is, and that's not the way the soldiers in the field have been.
They've been tough and capable.
     And decent people.  That's the other thing about militaries, both our
militaries are full of compassionate people.  Because not only are we chasing
down people and bringing them to justice, as we say, but there are schools being
built, orphanages being opened, hospitals being supplied, thanks to
compassionate British troops, and American troops, as well, and other troops.
It speaks to the honor of our respective militaries, these are honorable people.
     Q    You're going to speak to some of the families of those who have
already died in Iraq, and also September the 11th.
     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.
     Q    You're going to see them, I guess, on Downing Street.
     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'm not sure exactly where, but, you bet, I am going
to see them.
     Q    What are you going to say to them?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'm going to first of all ask for God's blessings,
because I understand how bad they hurt.  I can't imagine what it would be like
if I were a mother or a dad to have lost a child.  I'm a proud dad, it's got to
shatter a person's heart to lose a loved one.  And I will do the best I can to
provide some comfort.  I have done this here in America, as well.  It's part of
my duty as the leader of this country to comfort those who have sacrificed.
     I'll also explain to them as best as I can that the sacrifices that their
loved one has made is for a noble cause, and that's peace and freedom.  I
strongly believe that what we're doing today will make it easier for this
person's grandchild to grow up in a free world and a peaceful world.
     I'll tell you an interesting story, kind of dawned on me a while ago.  I
was talking to Prime Minister Koizumi of Japan in Tokyo -- we were having
dinner, actually.  And I kind of reflected on what it would be like -- during
our dinner, I reflected on what it would be like if America and the allies
hadn't done a good job in post-World War II, would I be sitting with a Prime
Minister of Japan, with whom I've got great relations, talking about how to deal
with Kim Jong-il and North Korea?  It's an interesting thought.
     Q    Very interesting.
     THE PRESIDENT:  Beyond that is whether or not somebody 50 years from now is
going to be sitting with a leader from Iraq, or any other country in that
region, saying, "Thank goodness George W. and Tony Blair held the line, because
I'm now able to deal with terrorist threats or potential terrorist threats with
an ally; I'm able to help bring more peace to the world."
     Presidents and Prime Ministers should never worry about their short-term
history, how they're viewed in short-term history.  There's no such thing as
short-term history, except for the musings of somebody who's not very objective
to begin with.  Because if you set big goals and work on big items, the
President or the Prime Minister won't be around to see the effects of those
policies.  And, therefore, I don't worry about the short-term history.  I think
in terms of long-term history I know what we're doing now is going to have an
effect, a positive effect on this world.
     Q    Can I just backtrack a little?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.
     Q    You were talking earlier about the contributions countries like
Britain and Italy have made and others.
     THE PRESIDENT:  Spain, Poland, a lot of people.
     Q    You didn't mention France and Germany in that -- you seem very
critical of France.
     THE PRESIDENT:  Look, my attitude is the past is there, it's past, and now
let's go on.  I'll tell you one example of why that attitude is important, and
that is Germany's contribution in Afghanistan.  And it's a positive contribution

JUDGES: ROBIE, J.; Blease, Acting P.J., and Davis, J., concurred.
OPINIONBY: ROBIE
OPINION: Defendant Jean Michel Rabaduex was charged with 199 offenses arising out of his sexual acts with and electronic surveillance of his live-in girlfriend's daughter. Defendant moved to suppress evidence obtained from a search of his house because "the police did not comply with knock and announce principles, particularly by failing to wait a sufficient period of time after 'knock-notice' to infer a constructive refusal to enter." The court denied defendant's motion. He subsequently pled guilty to all counts and was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. [*2]  Defendant argues that because police had reason to know the only person at home was asleep, it was unreasonable for them to enter the house only 30 seconds after first announcing their presence.
Because the only person home at the time of the entry was defendant's girlfriend, we conclude defendant failed to show the violation of his Fourth Amendment rights necessary to require suppression of the evidence against him. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress, and we will affirm the judgment.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
In September 2001, Deborah S. was living at a house in Tracy with her 14-year-old daughter C.S. and defendant. Defendant had lived with Deborah S. for about eight years but was not married to her and was not C.S.'s father.
In late September 2001, defendant's nephew Richard moved into the house. During his stay, Richard saw defendant touching C.S. inappropriately. Richard also discovered that hidden cameras had been installed in C.S.'s bedroom and bathroom. Richard found videotapes in defendant's bedroom depicting defendant and C.S. engaging in sexual intercourse. Richard then contacted [*3]  the Tracy Police Department.
A search warrant was issued for the house, and the resulting search, which was conducted on September 20, 2001, led to the seizure of numerous items, including two computers and various videotapes. The two computers contained over 1,000 images depicting child pornography. Police also determined that the video surveillance cameras set up in C.S.'s bedroom and bathroom were connected to a monitor in defendant's room.
Several days after the search, officers interviewed C.S. C.S. initially told officers that she began having sex with defendant when she was about 12 years old. At the preliminary hearing, C.S. testified that she began having sex with defendant when she was 14. She stated that she loved defendant and that he was the only father she had ever known.
Suppression Hearing
Deborah S. is employed as a nurse and had worked the night shift before the morning of the search. On the morning of the search, Deborah S. arrived home at 8:30 a.m. and went to bed about 10:30 a.m. Before going to bed, she spoke with defendant three or four times by telephone. The last call she received from defendant that morning was at 9:43 a.m.
Deborah [*4]  S. testified that she sleeps in the master bedroom at the top of the stairs with the door closed and that her dog sleeps in the room with her and barks whenever someone knocks on the door. There is a sign taped over the doorbell which reads, "Day sleeper. Do not ring doorbell."
Deborah S. claimed that on the day police executed the search warrant, she neither heard the police knocking nor her dog barking. She awoke from the sound of her home alarm system and opened the bedroom door to find police officers on the landing outside her bedroom.
A defense investigator testified that she went to the house with Deborah S. and waited inside the bedroom with the dog while defendant's lawyer rang the doorbell and knocked on the door. The investigator testified that the dog barked in response to both the knock and the doorbell.
The parties stipulated that C.S. had given officers the key to the house on the morning the warrant was executed. The parties also stipulated that the police asked C.S. if anyone was home, and C.S. said, "'My mom, she's sleeping.'" The prosecutor did not argue that C.S. gave the police consent to enter the house.
Detective Daniel Schnepple of the Tracy Police Department [*5]  testified that on September 20, 2001, at approximately 11:30 a.m., he and more than one-half dozen other officers approached defendant's two-story house. Detective Schnepple recalled noticing a sign about a day sleeper. Detective Shawn Steinkamp knocked on the door very loudly with his bare hand and yelled, "Tracy Police Department. Search warrant. Demand entry." Detective Steinkamp waited approximately five to eight seconds and then knocked again and repeated the announcement. The officers waited approximately 20 more seconds before entering the house with the key C.S. had given them. Detective Schnepple testified that the total time from the first knock to entry was roughly 30 to 35 seconds.
After entering the house, the officers looked around downstairs for approximately 35 to 45 seconds, maybe longer, then continued upstairs to find Deborah S. coming out of the master bedroom wearing a T-shirt and removing a sleep mask from her face. Detective Schnepple testified that Deborah S. appeared to be fumbling with earplugs; however, he never actually saw any earplugs. Deborah S. testified that she never wears earplugs because she needs to hear the phone ring in case of emergency.  [*6]
The trial court found that officers waited approximately 30 to 35 seconds after knocking and announcing their presence before entering the house and concluded this was a sufficient wait during the middle of the day. The court observed, "it may be that the officers constructively at least should have known that there was a sleeping person there," but the court concluded the officers did not have to wait longer based on that fact. The court stated: "Should the police have . . . waited five minutes because that's how much time it takes a sleeping person who happens to sleep in a certain clothing configuration to get downstairs? No. You know, it's the reasonableness of the police conduct to meet the policy generally of noticing people that police are about to come into their house. Not of this person specifically."
The trial court expressed reservation about allowing more time for people with "do not disturb" or "day sleeper" signs to respond to police seeking to execute search warrants, noting that drug dealers might place such signs on their doors to buy themselves more time to destroy the evidence of their crimes. The court concluded that the police "have to wait the appropriate [*7]  time" and that "the cases have fixed that somewhere around 30 seconds," which the court found was the amount of time the police waited in this case. Accordingly, the court denied defendant's motion to suppress.
Defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the court improperly concluded officers waited a reasonable time after knocking and giving notice of their presence and purpose before entering the house to execute the search warrant. Defendant contends that waiting only 30 to 35 seconds was unreasonable because officers knew the occupant of the house was likely to be asleep and they had no reason to make a quick entry. We conclude, however, that because the person who was at home at the time of the entry was defendant's girlfriend, and not defendant himself, the alleged knock-notice violation did not provide any basis for suppressing evidence against defendant. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress.
Standard of Review
In reviewing a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress, we defer to the trial court's findings of fact, both express and implied, if supported by [*8]  substantial evidence. However, we independently apply the pertinent legal principles to those facts to determine as a matter of law whether there has been an unreasonable search or seizure. (People v. Miranda (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 917, 922.)
The Knock-Notice Rule
Penal Code section 1531, which applies to the execution of search warrants, provides: "The officer may break open any outer or inner door or window of a house, or any part of a house, or anything therein, to execute the warrant, if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance." "[A]n entry effected in violation of the provisions of this statute renders any following search and seizure unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment." (Garcia v. Superior Court (1973) 29 Cal. App. 3d 977, 980, 106 Cal. Rptr. 98.) As the United States Supreme Court has declared, "the common-law knock and announce principle forms a part of the Fourth Amendment reasonableness inquiry." (Wilson v. Arkansas (1995) 514 U.S. 927, 930 [131 L. Ed. 2d 976, 980, 115 S. Ct. 1914].) There is no dispute in this case that the officers [*9]  seeking to search defendant's house gave notice of their authority and purpose, or that they "broke" into defendant's house within the meaning of Penal Code section 1531 when they used the key C.S. gave them to open the door. (See People v. Flores (1968) 68 Cal.2d 563, 567, 68 Cal. Rptr. 161, 440 P.2d 233 [entry by means of a key constitutes a "breaking" within the meaning of Penal Code section 1531], overruled on other grounds in People v. De Santiago (1969) 71 Cal.2d 18, 28, fn. 7, 76 Cal. Rptr. 809, 453 P.2d 353.) The issue here is whether, when the police entered the house, they had been "refused admittance."
"Section 1531 permits an officer executing a search warrant to break into the premises only if he is refused admission after announcing 'his authority and purpose.' Even where the police duly announce their identity and purpose, forcible entry is not permitted under the statute if the occupants of the premises are not first given an opportunity to surrender the premises voluntarily." (Jeter v. Superior Court (1983) 138 Cal. App. 3d 934, 937, 188 Cal. Rptr. 351, italics added.  [*10]  )
There need not be an explicit refusal of admittance before officers are entitled to enter a house to execute a search warrant. "The failure to respond within a reasonable time under the circumstances may constitute a refusal within the meaning of the statute." (People v. Gallo (1981) 127 Cal. App. 3d 828, 838, 179 Cal. Rptr. 662.) "There is no convenient test for measuring the length of time necessary to support an implied refusal." (People v. Neer (1986) 177 Cal. App. 3d 991, 996, 223 Cal. Rptr. 555.) "[T]he test is whether 'the circumstances were such as would convince a reasonable man that permission to enter had been refused.'" (United States v. Bustamante-Gamez (9th Cir. 1973) 488 F.2d 4, 11, quoting McClure v. United States (9th Cir. 1964) 332 F.2d 19, 22; see also People v. Neer, supra, 177 Cal. App. 3d at p. 996 [question is whether there are "specific facts, such as shouting or running, to support an objectively reasonable belief the occupants had refused entry"].)
Defendant's Right to Raise the Alleged Knock-Notice Violation
Because it was Deborah S., not [*11]  defendant, who was at home when the police allegedly entered the house without waiting to be refused admittance, we asked the parties to brief the issue of whether defendant had "standing" to challenge the alleged failure of the police to comply with knock-notice requirements. Defendant contends the "standing" issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal and, in any event, "a temporarily absent resident [has] 'standing' to object to an unannounced entry into the premises." The People contend that phrasing the issue in terms of "standing" "only confuses the analysis." According to the People, "the pertinent inquiry is whether this particular search . . . was reasonable as to defendant, an absent resident with no ownership interest in the property." n1

n1 The record of the suppression hearing is actually silent as to whether defendant had an ownership interest in the house. Deborah S. testified the mortgage on the house was in her name, and she qualified for the mortgage based on her income alone. While this evidence supports the inference that Deborah S. alone owned the house, it does not compel that conclusion. In any event, for reasons set forth below, the ownership issue is irrelevant.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - [*12]
For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that because the alleged knock-notice violation in this case was not a violation of defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, his motion to suppress was properly denied.
"'Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights which . . . may not be vicariously asserted.'" (Rakas v. Illinois (1978) 439 U.S. 128, 133-134 [58 L. Ed. 2d 387, 394, 99 S. Ct. 421], quoting Alderman v. United States (1969) 394 U.S. 165, 174 [22 L. Ed. 2d 176, 187, 89 S. Ct. 961].) "[S]ince the exclusionary rule is an attempt to effectuate the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment [citation], it is proper to permit only defendants whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated to benefit from the rule's protections." (Rakas, at p. 134 [58 L. Ed. 2d. at p. 395].) Thus, the question in a case such as this is "whether the challenged search . . . violated the Fourth Amendment rights of [the] criminal defendant who seeks to exclude the evidence obtained during [the search]. That inquiry in turn requires a determination of whether the disputed search and seizure has infringed an interest of the defendant which the [*13]  Fourth Amendment was designed to protect." (Id. at p. 140 [58 L. Ed. 2d. at p. 399].)
With the question before us properly framed, we reject defendant's assertion that the issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. The issue we confront -- whether the challenged search violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights -- is not new; it is the fundamental issue presented by defendant's motion to suppress. Subdivision (a)(1)(B)(iv) of Penal Code section 1538.5 authorizes a defendant to "move . . . to suppress as evidence any tangible or intangible thing obtained as a result of a search or seizure" when "[t]he search or seizure with a warrant was unreasonable because . . . [P] [t]he method of execution of the warrant violated federal or state constitutional standards." As the moving party, it was defendant's burden to prove the police entry violated his constitutional rights. (See People v. Moreno (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 577, 582.) If he failed to carry this burden, then the motion to suppress was properly denied, regardless of the reason for the trial court's ruling. "'"No rule of decision is better or more firmly [*14]  established by authority, nor one resting upon a sounder basis of reason and propriety, than that a ruling or decision, itself correct in law, will not be disturbed on appeal merely because given for a wrong reason. If right upon any theory of the law applicable to the case, it must be sustained regardless of the considerations which may have moved the trial court to its conclusion." [Citation.]'" (People v. Zapien (1993) 4 Cal.4th 929, 976, 846 P.2d 704, quoting D'Amico v. Board of Medical Examiners (1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 19, 112 Cal. Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10.)
Under the foregoing rule, "a respondent [on appeal] may assert a new theory to establish that an order was correct on that theory 'unless doing so would unfairly prejudice appellant by depriving him or her of the opportunity to litigate an issue of fact.'" (Bailon v. Appellate Division (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1339.) Relying on this exception, defendant contends "this court does not have all the facts necessary to make a determination as to whether [he] lacked 'standing' to object to the failure of the police to comply with knock-and-announce rules" [*15]  because "trial counsel was not put on notice of the 'standing' issue so as to be able to develop whether [defendant] was within earshot or 'eyeshot' of the We disagree. In his written motion to suppress, defendant vaguely asserted that the police entry into the house violated knock-notice requirements because police entered "without giving adequate notice to the resident therein." In its written opposition to the motion, the prosecution asserted the search occurred "while the defendant was at work" and while Deborah S. was at home. At the subsequent hearing, defendant offered no evidence to dispute the assertion that he was at work. Instead, defendant's motion was premised on the ground that police did not give Deborah S., the "sleeping occupant [who] they knew or should have known was present in that home and asleep time to get down and answer the door." Furthermore, the evidence showed that from the time she arrived home from work at about 8:30 a.m. until 9:43. a.m., when she started to get ready for bed, Deborah S. received several telephone calls from defendant -- suggesting he was nowhere near the house. Under these circumstances, defendant's belated suggestion [*16]  that he might have been able to prove he was "within earshot or 'eyeshot' of the home" when the police arrived about 11:30 that morning does not persuade us that defendant was denied a fair opportunity "to develop the pertinent facts" before the trial court.
Having concluded the issue is properly before us, we turn to the question of whether defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the police conduct in this case.
Four primary reasons underlie the knock-notice rule in California: "'"(1) The protection of the privacy of the individual in his home [citations]; (2) the protection of innocent persons who may also be present on the premises . . . [citation]; (3) the prevention of situations which are conducive to violent confrontations between the occupant and individuals who enter his home without proper notice [citations]; and (4) the protection of police who might be injured by a startled and fearful householder."'" (People v. Hoag (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1198, 1203.) Additionally, the privacy interest underlying the knock-notice rule has several aspects. "First, [the knock-notice rule] protects the homeowner from the outrage of having his ' [*17]  castle' suddenly and violently broken into. [Citations.] . . . [P] Second, the rule may prevent embarrassing circumstances resulting from the unexpected exposure of private activities. [Citations.]" (United States v. Bustamante-Gamez, supra, 488 F.2d at pp. 11-12.) Third, because officers must wait to be refused admittance even under circumstances where immediate entry will not require the destruction of property, the "refused admittance" aspect of the knock-notice rule gives the homeowner an opportunity to consent to the entry of his or her home, rather than suffering the indignity of having law enforcement officers both enter and search without his or her permission. n2
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - Footnotes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
n2 By referring to the homeowner's consent, we do not mean to suggest that the search pursuant to the warrant is transformed into a search pursuant to the homeowner's consent. The consent to which we refer is the homeowner's consent -- or rather, his opportunity to consent -- to the officers' entry to the property not to the search of it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - [*18]
As we have explained, the alleged knock-notice violation here was the failure of police to wait a reasonable time before entering the house. Assuming for the sake of argument the police did not wait a sufficient amount of time, and their premature entry into the house infringed on the privacy interests protected by the knock-notice rule, those interests were not those of defendant, because he was not home at the time and therefore was in no position either to be embarrassed by a premature entry or to let the police into the house in response to their demand. The only occupant of the house at the time of the search was Deborah S. The infringement on Deborah's rights to avoid embarrassing circumstances and to have a reasonable opportunity to let the police in, however, provides no basis for the suppression of evidence to be used against defendant. To successfully suppress evidence against him, defendant had to show that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the actions of the police. He failed to do so.
We note that our conclusion is at odds with the conclusion in People v. Hoag on the same point. In Hoag, the court noted the rule that a defendant moving [*19]  to suppress evidence "may not vicariously challenge the alleged violation of another's interests." (People v. Hoag, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 1203.) Nonetheless, under circumstances similar to those in this case, n3 the court concluded that the defendant, who was not home at the time of the police entry, had the right to challenge the alleged knock-notice violation that occurred in his absence. (Id. at pp. 1203-1207.) The court based its conclusion on the defendant's "personal interest in the safety of the mother of his child, who was present when the officers entered his residence," and on the defendant's "right to be protected from the unnecessary destruction of his property." (Id. at p. 1205.)

N3 In Hoag, sheriff's deputies served a search warrant on the defendant's home one evening while he was away. (People v. Hoag, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 1202.) A deputy knocked and announced, "'Sheriff's Department, search warrant, we demand entry.'" (Ibid.) After hearing no response following a second knock and announcement, a second deputy turned the door handle and the deputies entered. (Ibid.) The entry occurred approximately 15 to 20 seconds after the deputies' first knock. (Ibid.) Deputies found the defendant's fiance inside studying. (Id. at pp. 1201-1202.) They searched the residence and found marijuana in the garage. (Id. at p. 1202.)

We disagree with the Hoag court that the right to be protected from the unnecessary destruction of property provides a basis for a suppression motion based on a knock-notice violation where no such destruction occurs. To the extent knock-notice requirements protect a homeowner's right to avoid the unnecessary destruction of his property, that right is not even implicated -- let alone infringed -- when police entry occurs through an unlocked door (as in Hoag) or, as here, through a locked door opened with a key. Of course, such an entry may infringe the homeowner's right to privacy, or some other interest protected by knock-notice requirements. If that is the case, however, then the analysis properly focuses on whether the infringement of those other interests justifies the suppression of evidence. We can perceive no valid basis for holding that a person whose property is not damaged in the slightest by a premature entry in violation of knock-notice requirements is nonetheless entitled to the suppression of evidence seized following the entry because one of the purposes of knock-notice requirements in the abstract is the protection against the unnecessary destruction of property. [*21]
We find the decision of the Arizona Court of Appeals in State v. Papineau (1985) 146 Ariz. 272 [705 P.2d 949] persuasive on this point. In Papineau, "officers waited five to ten seconds after knocking and announcing before entering, and . . . they entered [through an unlocked door] only after hearing 'rustling' movements within," while the defendant was not home. (Id. at p. 950.) In concluding the defendant had no "standing" to assert  "Only one whose own rights have been violated may seek the remedy of exclusion. [Citation.] 'The right which knock and announce rules provide occupants is the right to be warned that their privacy is about to be legally invaded.' [Citation.] Also important are avoidance of violent confrontations attendant to unannounced entries, prevention of destruction of property, and preventing unexpected exposure of private activities. [Citations.] Entry through an unlocked door involves no destruction of property. While those present may have felt their privacy unjustifiably invaded and while the entry may have heightened the risk of violent confrontation, only [*22]  those present would have rights that would be violated. One not present at the entry would lose nothing. No rights of the defendant having been invaded, he has no standing to assert the illegality of the entry." (Id. at pp. 950-951, italics omitted.)
As we have noted, the question in a case such as this is "whether the disputed search and seizure has infringed on an interest of the defendant which the Fourth Amendment was designed to protect." (Rakas v. Illinois, supra, 439 U.S. at p. 140 [58 L. Ed. 2d. at p. 399].) An entry that does not destroy any property does not infringe on the defendant's right to avoid the unnecessary destruction of his property. Therefore, if such an entry is to provide a basis for the suppression of evidence, suppression can be justified only because the entry infringed on some other interest protected by knock-notice requirements.
We also disagree with the Hoag court's conclusion that an absent defendant's "personal interest in the safety of [another] who was present when the officers entered his residence" provides a valid basis for a suppression motion based on a knock-notice violation. (People v. Hoag, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 1205.) [*23]  In reaching that conclusion, the Hoag court relied on the decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court in Mazepink v. State (1999) 336 Ark. 171 [987 S.W.2d 648]. In Mazepink, the court concluded that because "at least one person was present to comply with the officers' request for entry so that they could execute their search warrant," "[i]t seems irrelevant . . . that Mazepink was not actually present at the time of entry; his standing to seek exclusion of the evidence obtained after the search is grounded in his right to exclude others and to be free from illegal police invasion of his privacy in his residence. Furthermore, Mazepink's legitimate expectation of privacy in his residence encompasses the right to expect not only privacy for himself, but for his family and invitees, including his live-in girlfriend . . . and her daughter." (Id. at p. 652.) Thus, the Mazepink court concluded that the defendant's legitimate expectation of privacy for himself and for his family and invitees in his home gave him the right to assert that a knock-notice violation that occurred in his absence violated his Fourth Amendment rights.
In support of its conclusion,  [*24]  the Mazepink court cited the United States Supreme Court's decision in Alderman v. United States, supra, 394 U.S. 165, 179, fn. 11 [22 L. Ed. 2d at p. 190]. (Mazepink v. State, supra, 987 S.W.2d at p. 652.) Alderman, however, did not involve a knock-notice violation, but instead involved illegal electronic surveillance. In Alderman, the court reiterated that "Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights which, like some other constitutional rights, may not be vicariously asserted," and went on to conclude that a defendant "would be entitled to the suppression of government evidence originating in electronic surveillance violative of his own Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures . . . if the United States unlawfully overheard conversations of [the defendant] himself or conversations occurring on his premises, whether or not he was present or participated in those conversations." (Alderman v. United States, supra, 394 U.S. at pp. 174, 176 [22 L. Ed. 2d at pp. 187-188].) The court explained that the defendant's presence was not necessary to render the electronic surveillance [*25]  a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights because "[t]he rights of the owner of the premises are as clearly invaded when the police [illegally] enter and install a listening device in his house as they are when the entry is made to undertake a warrantless search for tangible property; and the prosecution as surely employs the fruits of an illegal search of the home when it offers overheard third-party conversations as it does when it introduces tangible evidence belonging not to the homeowner, but to others." (Id. at pp. 179-180 [22 L. Ed. 2d at p. That the Fourth Amendment protects a person against the unlawful electronic surveillance of his house, even when he is absent, does not mean, as the Mazepink court concluded, that the person has "the right to expect . . . privacy . . . for his family and invitees," (Mazepink v. State, supra, 987 S.W.2d at p. 652) such that a knock-notice violation that occurs in the person's absence necessarily constitutes a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. Again, we point out that the pertinent question in a case such as this is "whether the disputed search and seizure has infringed [*26]  an interest of the defendant which the Fourth Amendment was designed to protect." (Rakas v. Illinois, supra, 439 U.S. at p. 140 [58 L. Ed. 2d at p. 399], italics added.) The court in Alderman did not hold that a defendant has a legitimate interest in the privacy of others present in his house. Rather, the court held that unlawful electronic surveillance of a house violates the homeowner's legitimate right to privacy in his own house, even when the "fruit" of the unlawful search is a conversation that occurs between two other people when the homeowner is not even home.
Furthermore, the legitimate expectation of privacy a person has for himself in his own house -- which was the interest at issue in Alderman -- is not implicated by a knock-notice violation that occurs when the person is absent. The Alaska Court of Appeals offered a cogent explanation of this point in State v. Johnson (Alaska.Ct.App. 1986) 716 P.2d 1006. In Johnson, the appellate court concluded the trial court had erred in suppressing evidence against two defendants (Robert Johnson and Michael Davey) who were not present when the knock-notice violation occurred.  [*27]  (Id. at p. 1010.) In explaining its conclusion, the court noted "the purposes of knock and announce requirements [are] as follows: [P] '(1) to protect the occupant's right to privacy . . .; (2) to safeguard the police who might be mistaken for prowlers and be shot . . .; and (3) to protect other persons who might be injured by violent resistance to unannounced entries. . . .'" (Id. at p. 1009, quoting Davis v. State (Alaska 1974) 525 P.2d 541, 544-545.) The court then explained: "Since Johnson and Michael Davey were not present, they were not vulnerable to injury as a result of any violent resistance [the occupant] might have interposed to the officers' entry. Johnson and Michael Davey had the same interest as any other citizen in preventing injury to the police officers. Thus, if the knock and announce rules were intended to protect them, it must be because of the first purpose announced in Davis, protection of the occupant's right to privacy. We assume, for purposes of this case, that Robert Johnson and Michael Davey had privacy interests protected by the fourth amendment in materials stored on the premises. Johnson argues [*28]  that this privacy interest is identical to the privacy interest protected by the knock and announce rules. We disagree. As the Oregon Supreme Court pointed out in State v. Valentine, 264 Or. 54, 504 P.2d 84 (1972), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 948, 93 S. Ct. 3001, 37 L. Ed. 2d 1000 (1973), 'The only right of privacy protected by the announcement requirement is the right to know who is entering, why he is entering, and a few seconds to prepare for his entry.' Id. at 87. The knock and announce rules are not intended to protect an absent co-tenant's possessory and privacy interests in items stored on the premises. The requirement that the police obtain a warrant and limit their search to the scope of the warrant protects these interests. Consequently, since the knock and announce rules were not enacted to protect the rights of those who are not present when a warrant is executed, it necessarily follows that they cannot complain of a violation of those rules." (State v. Johnson, supra, 716 P.2d at pp. 1009-1010.)
Johnson illustrates the proposition that the privacy interests infringed by a knock-notice violation are not [*29]  the same as the privacy interest infringed by an invalid search that should not have occurred at all. In determining whether a knock-notice violation warrants the suppression of evidence, it is critical to focus on the interests protected by knock-notice requirements and whether any of those interests belong to the defendant seeking suppression. The Mazepink court failed to do this, and the Hoag court adopted the Mazepink court's faulty reasoning. Thus, we cannot follow Hoag on this point.
In summary, we conclude the search of the house did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights because defendant was not present when the police made their allegedly premature, but nondestructive, entry into the house, and therefore no interest of defendant was infringed by the entry. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to The judgment is affirmed.
Blease, Acting P.J., and Davis, J., concurred.

This is sound advice of course, as is the point about not inviting

When I was served with the Carl Johnson subpoena, I had had a party
the night before and one fellow (a 20something sysadmin from
Baltimore) was asleep on the couch in the front room. At the sound of

Even if you don't have a lawyer on retainer, and I suspect few folks

No. 11-02-00323-CR
COURT OF APPEALS OF TEXAS, ELEVENTH DISTRICT, EASTLAND
November 5, 2003, Filed
PRIOR HISTORY: Appeal from the 266th District of Erath County.
DISPOSITION: Affirmed.
COUNSEL: For Plaintiff or Petitioner: Andrew Ottaway, Attorney At Law, Granbury, TX.
For Defendant or Respondent: John Terrill, District Attorney, Stephenville, TX.
JUDGES: Panel consists of: Arnot, C.J., and Wright, J., and McCall, J.
OPINIONBY: TERRY McCALL
OPINION: Appellant pleaded guilty to the first degree felony offense of the manufacture of methamphetamine. The jury assessed punishment at 20 years confinement and found that appellant used or exhibited a deadly weapon during the commission of the offense. The trial court entered a deadly weapon finding in its judgment. See TEX. CODE CRIM. PRO. ANN. art. 42.12, ' 3g(a)(2) (Vernon Supp. 2003). We affirm.
In his sole point of error, appellant complains that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's finding that he used or exhibited a deadly weapon in the commission of the offense. HN1To determine if the evidence is legally sufficient, we must review all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict [*2]  and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560, 99 S. Ct. 2781 (1979); Jackson v. State, 17 S.W.3d 664 (Tex.Cr.App.2000). To determine if the evidence is factually sufficient, we must review all of the evidence in a neutral light and determine whether the evidence supporting guilt is so weak as to render the conviction clearly wrong and manifestly unjust or whether the evidence supporting guilt, although adequate when taken alone, is so greatly outweighed by the overwhelming weight of contrary evidence as to render the conviction clearly wrong and manifestly unjust. Vasquez v. State, 67 S.W.3d 229, 236 (Tex.Cr.App.2002); Goodman v. State, 66 S.W.3d 283 (Tex.Cr.App.2001); Johnson v. State, 23 S.W.3d 1, 11 (Tex.Cr.App.2000); Cain v. State, 958 S.W.2d 404 (Tex.Cr.App.1997); Clewis v. State, 922 S.W.2d 126 (Tex.Cr.App. HN2The Court of Criminal Appeals has defined the terms "use" and "exhibit" as they are used in Article 42.12, section 3g(a)(2).  [*3]  Gale v. State, 998 S.W.2d 221, 225 (Tex.Cr.App. 1999); Patterson v. State, 769 S.W.2d 938, 941 (Tex.Cr.App.1989). The "use" of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony offense extends to any employment of a deadly weapon, even its simple possession, if such possession facilitated the associated felony. Patterson v. State, supra. A defendant's use of a deadly weapon in the sense of protecting and facilitating his possession of a controlled substance constitutes "use" of a deadly weapon under Article 42.12, section 3g(a)(2). Gale v. State, supra; Patterson v. State, supra.
In this case, the evidence showed that law enforcement officers searched appellant's residence, pursuant to a search warrant, on December 12, 2001. Investigator Gerald Wayne Rogers of the S.T.O.P. Narcotics Task Force participated in the search. Investigator Rogers testified that, other than the officers, appellant was the only person present at the residence during the search. The officers discovered methamphetamine during the search. They also discovered a working methamphetamine laboratory in the residence and ingredients [*4]  necessary to manufacture methamphetamine.
Investigator Rogers said that appellant's residence was equipped with surveillance equipment. The officers saw their vehicles on the surveillance television in the living room to the left of the front door. The officers found a loaded sawed-off double-barreled shotgun on a couch that was near the television. Investigator Rogers said that a person sitting on the couch could watch the surveillance on the television and be ready to shoot the shotgun if anybody came in the front door. Investigator Rogers testified that, in his experience, individuals who are involved in manufacturing methamphetamine are generally well armed. Investigator Rogers said that the shotgun was a deadly weapon that was used in the commission of the offense of manufacturing the methamphetamine.
Appellant does not deny that the shotgun was a deadly weapon or that he was in possession of it. Rather; he argues that there was no evidence to support the jury's finding that his possession of the shotgun facilitated the associated felony of manufacturing methamphetamine. We disagree. Based on the evidence, a rational trier of fact could find that the shotgun facilitated appellant's [*5]  offense of manufacturing. The officers found the loaded shotgun on the couch near the surveillance television. The evidence was legally and factually sufficient to establish that appellant "used" the shotgun in the sense that it protected and facilitated his manufacturing of the methamphetamine. Gale v. State, supra; Patterson v. State, supra. Appellant's sole point of error is overruled.
The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

                           INTERVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT

                          TREVOR KAVANAGH OF "THE SUN"
                                The Oval Office
                               November 14, 2003
9:31 A.M. EST
     THE PRESIDENT:  Have you ever been in the Oval Office before?
     Q    Once, just once --
     THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  The rug was designed by my wife.  Every President
gets to design his own rug.  You probably didn't know that.
     Q    Fabulous.
     THE PRESIDENT:  I wanted mine -- mine was designed by my wife, Laura.  And
I wanted people to have a sense of optimism  when they came in here, that this
is a guy who kind of sees a better world, not a worse world.  Sometimes the Oval
can be foreboding, and I wanted it to be cheery.  So I hope you felt that.
     This is called, "A Charge To Keep," it's based upon a Methodist hymn.  One
of America's great imports from England was John Wesley.  And it talks about
serving something greater than yourself, which speaks to my own personal faith;
as a President, it speaks to my need to capture the spirit of America and call
on people to serve.  You've probably followed some of my domestic policy, but
one of the things that's important is to call on people to serve their
communities by helping neighbors who hurt.   The de Tocquevillean view of
America at that point was just, kind of, a civic fabric of loving organizations;
part of my vision, as well, is to energize them.
     The paintings of Texas.  That's kind of what my ranch looks like, by a guy
named Onderdonk, he's a Texas landscape artist.  The blue bonnets are not quite
that big.  Blair and I -- well, he's been there, and he would recognize kind of
the look, if he were here.  This is West Texas, where my wife's family was
raised.  We were both raised in West Texas, but this is farther west than where
I was raised.  It's called El Paso.  But it's a famous Texas artist and
historian who painted that.
     More Texas.  The reason I have Texas up there is it's where I'm from.  And
in this job if you can't figure out who you are -- you better know who you are
because of the pressures and the decision making process and all the noise of
politics and all that (inaudible).
     Really quickly, this is a desk given to us by Queen Victoria.  A famous
desk called the HMS Resolute, and it's wood from the Resolute.  The door was put
on by Roosevelt to cover his infirmities.  Out of the door poked John Kennedy's
son --
     Q    Oh, yes, I remember.
     THE PRESIDENT:  I chose to use this -- Ronald Reagan put the bottom on to
make the desk high so it won't bump your knees.  I love the desk.  I love its
history.  It does speak to the great relationship between America and Great
Britain, I'm sitting at a desk given to our country by Queen Victoria.
     And, finally, the Churchill bust is on loan from the Brits.  Tony Blair
knew I was a great admirer of Churchill, so here he sits, along with Lincoln and
     That's it, welcome.
     Q    Fantastic.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Where would you like
     THE PRESIDENT:  Sit right here, take Vice President Cheney's seat.
     Q    I'm more than a little impressed by being here and by sitting in this
     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you know, this is a shrine to democracy and we treat
it as such.  And it's an honor to serve here.
     Q    Well, I would like to thank you on behalf of our readers for giving
them and me the time to talk to you.
     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'm glad you're here, thanks.
     Q    We're a very pro-American newspaper, and our readers were shocked and
deeply moved by September the 11th.  And they supported what happened
subsequently in Afghanistan, and a little more reluctantly in Iraq, but, in
fact, the majority of our readers were behind the action.
     I think what they would like to know -- we've talked with them in a way
which is quite interesting, we actually spent a weekend with about 2,000 of our
     THE PRESIDENT:  Really?  (Laughter.)  Good marketing tool.  (Laughter.)
That's interesting.
     Q    Yes.  And the one question they wanted to ask you is, is the world a
safer place after the conflict than it was before?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, much safer.  It's safer for a couple of reasons.  One,
the free world has recognized the threat.  In order to make the world safe
you've got to actually see reality.  And the reality is that there are
cold-blooded killers who were trying to intimidate, create fear, create
hostility and to shape the will of the civilized world.
     And a lot of countries have seen the threat for what it is.  So, therefore,
step one is recognizing the problem.  Tony Blair recognizes the problem, Jose
Maria Aznar recognizes the problem, Silvio Berlusconi recognizes the problem --
clearly, the United States recognizes the problem, after all, the clearest
indication that we were at war and that the stakes had changed dramatically was
September the 11th.  After all, we were a country which was able to sit back in
our -- kind of in our geographical posture and pick and choose where a threat
might emerge and say, we may have to deal with that or we may not deal with it;
we were pretty confident that we were protected ourselves by oceans.  That
     And one of my vows to the American people is I won't forget the lessons of
September the 11th, 2001.
     Secondly, the world is safer because the actions we have taken will
ultimately strengthen multi-national institutions.  Take the theater in Iraq.
The United Nations had recognized that Saddam Hussein was a threat, they
recognized it in not one resolution, but multiple resolutions -- and, yet,
didn't do anything about it.  And, therefore, the resolutions became weak,
became just words.
     And as a result of enforcing 1441, which said that you disarm or there will
be serious consequences, now when multi-national institutions speak, hopefully,
people will take them seriously.  And in order to win the war on terror, there
needs to be alliance and cooperation.  Because these are killers that are
capable of hiding in societies, they're patient, they're lethal, they pop up and
will destroy.  And, by the way, they don't care who they destroy.  There are no
rules for these people, they will kill children just as soon as they'll kill
somebody in a military uniform.
     Thirdly, the world is safer because there is a -- and, by the way,
multi-national forum doesn't necessarily mean U.N.  It can also mean
collaborations, like the collaboration that's now taking place with North Korea
in dealing with Kim Jong-il, who is a threat to peace.  And now it's not just
the United States dealing with Kim Jong-il, it's the United States, China, South
Korea, Japan and Russia in a collaborative effort.  Or the fine work -- the
initial fine work done by the foreign ministers of Great Britain, France and
Germany in telling Iran to get rid of its nuclear ambitions.  I say "initial
fine work" because the Iranians, in the past, have had clandestine operations.
And, therefore, in order to make sure that the words that have been issued to
them are true, there must be transparency.
     Fourthly, we dealt al Qaeda.  We are tough on al Qaeda.  Now, you know,
there are key figures still looming in caves and remote regions of the world,
but we're dismantling them.  If you were to look at al Qaeda as a business
organization, middle management is no longer.  That's not to say that they're
not grooming junior executives to take over certain roles.  But we're tough and
we're on their trail and we're still hunting them down.  Make no mistake about
it.  And as a result of dismantling al Qaeda, the world is safer.
     We've also dealt with the tyrants in Afghanistan, which is an incredibly
dangerous regime -- dangerous not only to the free world because they provided
housing, training, money, safe haven -- but also they were just tortuous and
barbaric to their own people.  And in Iraq, Saddam Hussein was clearly a threat
to peace.  And we can argue about the definition of "serious consequence," and I
respect the debate, but no one can justify this man's behavior to his people.
We've discovered mass graves with over 300,000 people there, rape rooms and
torture rooms.  He is paying suiciders to go kill innocent Israelis.  He had a
weapons program as discovered -- I promise you this is going to be a short
answer, eventually; I saw you looking at the clock, your glance can't escape me.
     This is an important question.  It is the question.
     Q    Of course, absolutely.
     THE PRESIDENT:  David Kay discovered a weapons program that was in material
breach of 1441.  In other words, it was in violation of precisely what the
United Nations had asked him not to do.  Saddam Hussein, in 1991, it was assumed
that he -- his nuclear weapons program would be active in the out years and, in
fact, the inspectors discovered he's got nuclear ambitions, not only real and
active, but his program was a lot farther along than we thought.  And had he
ever developed a nuclear weapon, had he been allowed to have a nuclear weapon,
he would have been the ultimate source of international blackmail.
     And so the removal of Saddam Hussein makes the world safer.  And, as
importantly, the removal of Saddam Hussein gives the Iraqis a chance to live in
freedom, which is the ultimate -- freedom is the ultimate route to security.  I
strongly believe that free nations are peaceful nations.  Free nations are not
terrorist havens, do not become terrorist havens.  Free nations won't create
conditions of strife and resentment that breeds anxiety and terror.
     And, therefore, the world is becoming safer, is safer and will be even more
safe when Iraq becomes free.  And Iraq will be free, and it'll be peaceful.  And
we need peace and freedom in that part of the world.
     Now, there's an interesting debate going on as to whether or not people,
like the Iraqis, will ever adapt the habits of freedom.  There's kind of an
elitism that takes place -- in our country, in your country and elsewhere,
feels, well, certain people can't be free, they can't adapt the habits of
democracy.  I strongly disagree.  I strongly disagree.
     And so, yes, the world is safer and the world is more peaceful.
     Q    Okay.  That answer will resonate with our readers.  Nonetheless, there
is concern about the events, particularly in the last week or so, when things
have escalated.  I think this causes concern everywhere.  Are we going to
increase military presence there?  Are we going to pull out?  There's a fear
that --
     THE PRESIDENT:  You don't have to worry about us pulling out.
     Q    There's a famous t-shirt, slogan, which shows the American flag and
the words, "these colors don't run."  Do you stand by that?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Our will is being tested.
See, the tactics of the terrorists is to kill as many innocent people as
possible and, therefore, try to shape the will of the Iraqis.  As progress is
made -- and we're making interesting progress, and I'll cite some examples in a
minute that I think are fascinating.  But as the Iraqis begin to say, wait a
minute, life can be better, and their instincts kick in about what it means to
live in a free society, the terrorists want to shake that.  They want to scare
them.  They want the police not to become police.  And we've got over 118,000
people now, Iraqi citizens in uniform beginning to conduct operations for their
own security.
     They, of course, want to kill our own soldiers, and, therefore, try to
shake the will of the American people and the President and the command
structure.  They killed those Italians.  And they were hoping that Berlusconi
would say, oh, my goodness, this is too big a fight, we'll leave.  We're not
leaving.  We're staying there to get the job done.  Of course we mourn the death
of any citizen.  But I recognize that it is -- I still remember the death, what
happened to us on September the 11th, as well.  I was there at Ground Zero right
after the attacks and I remember this kind of haze and the smells and the death
and destruction.  I'll always remember that, of course.
     And, as I've told you, I vowed not to forget the lessons.
     Q    That changed everything?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Absolutely.  Look, what changed for me was sitting on Air
Force One and getting the reports that we were under attack.  And I made up my
mind then, right then, that we didn't need a bunch of legal briefs, I didn't
need a bunch of -- you know, let's kind of hold hands and hope to get the right
answer -- we were at war and we were going to win the war.  And I still feel
that same exact determination today that I did then.
     Q    So you'll stay in Iraq even --
     THE PRESIDENT:  We will do our job.
     Q    -- after there's an interim council, a government which is --
     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  There's a lot of talk right now about the political
process, as there should be.  And we are interested in the Iraqis assuming more
responsibility on the political side and on the security side.  And a political
process in which the Iraqis assume more responsibility will make the security
side come together quicker, as well, in our judgment.
     And, therefore, Bremer came here, he took instructions back from me to talk
to the Governing Council to find out what is feasible when it comes to the
passing of more power to the Governing Council.  That's where we are right
     On the security side, absolutely we're there.  The goal is for Iraq to be
peaceful and free.  I understand the consequences of a free and peaceful Iraq in
the midst of the Middle East.  We can have the debate all day long as to whether
the Middle East will ever adapt the habits of democracy and freedom.  I think
they will, obviously; and I'm confident they will.  I like to tell people in
this country, freedom is not America's gift to the world, freedom is not Great
Britain's gift to the world, Freedom is the Almighty's gift to everybody in the
     Q    And this is what you'll tell the demonstrators?  Or this is what you
would tell the demonstrators if you had five minutes with them?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Of course I would, absolutely.  I will say, you may
disagree with our tactics -- nobody likes war, war is my last choice -- if the
demonstrators are there as anti-war protestors; they may be there for other
reasons, as well, global trade, and I'd be glad to talk to them about that, as
well.  But in terms of war, I can understand why people are anxious about war.
I can understand why citizens in Great Britain, protestor or not, wonders about
why a President would commit to war.  Because nobody likes war.
     On the other hand, I would tell them, the skeptics and the critics, that I
have a job to protect the security of the United States of America, and that
Saddam Hussein was a security risk, as witnessed by the international community
speaking loudly on that subject 12 different times.  But I would tell those who
doubt our policy that we share a common goal, which is peace, and that free
societies are peaceful societies.  They may say, well, you can't possibly expect
a country like Iraq to be free -- and then we'd have an interesting,
philosophical debate, because I believe freedom exists in the heart of every
single human being.  It may take longer for people to accept freedom, if they've
been tortured and brutalized like Saddam Hussein did.
     Secondly, I would tell the skeptics that not only is the world more secure
as a result of the decisions we made, the Iraqi people now have a chance to live
in a society which is hopeful and optimistic, a society in which you're able to
speak your mind, a society in which you don't have to pay homage to a brutal
tyrant and his two brutal sons -- which is precisely how they had to live in the
     Q    So how do you respond to those people who were polled by the Europe
commission and found that America was alongside Iran, North Korea is the second
most powerful threat to world peace?
     THE PRESIDENT:  You just have to tell them watch what happens.  The world
is going to be more peaceful and the free world will be more secure as a result
of the decisions we've taken.
     Q    Can I ask you about the special relationship, the role the British
soldiers play in Iraq and are still playing?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.
     Q    Would you like to tell me about you feel about our contribution?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, I'll tell you about your troops.  They are well
trained, they are well motivated and they're really good at what they do.  And
our soldiers and our generals and our commanders really appreciate being
side-by-side with the Brits.  They trust them, and that's important.
     Secondly, in Basra, the Brits have brought an interesting strategy in
dealing in Basra because you have dealt in Northern Ireland.  In other words, it
was kind of a transfer of experience that has been incredibly useful and
important.  I am really proud of our -- not only our alliance, because it's
close now and I intend to keep it that way.  I've got a great personal
relationship with Tony Blair.
     Let me tell you something about him just real quick, because it relates
also to the trust of the troops.  He's a man who comes in here and he says he's
going to do something, and as I said -- as they say in Texas, you can book him
when he says he's going to do something, you can take it to the bank.  Because
every time he has said something, he has done it, and I appreciate that a lot.
It's not always the way it is in politics -- whether it be domestic or
international politics.  Sometimes they'll come and look you in the eye and say,
"Oh, don't worry, Mr. President, we're with you and behind you," and it turns
out they're way behind you, you can't find them when the heat gets on.  But
that's not the way Tony Blair is, and that's not the way the Brits' command
structure is, and that's not the way the soldiers in the field have been.
They've been tough and capable.
     And decent people.  That's the other thing about militaries, both our
militaries are full of compassionate people.  Because not only are we chasing
down people and bringing them to justice, as we say, but there are schools being
built, orphanages being opened, hospitals being supplied, thanks to
compassionate British troops, and American troops, as well, and other troops.
It speaks to the honor of our respective militaries, these are honorable people.
     Q    You're going to speak to some of the families of those who have
already died in Iraq, and also September the 11th.
     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.
     Q    You're going to see them, I guess, on Downing Street.
     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'm not sure exactly where, but, you bet, I am going
to see them.
     Q    What are you going to say to them?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'm going to first of all ask for God's blessings,
because I understand how bad they hurt.  I can't imagine what it would be like
if I were a mother or a dad to have lost a child.  I'm a proud dad, it's got to
shatter a person's heart to lose a loved one.  And I will do the best I can to
provide some comfort.  I have done this here in America, as well.  It's part of
my duty as the leader of this country to comfort those who have sacrificed.
     I'll also explain to them as best as I can that the sacrifices that their
loved one has made is for a noble cause, and that's peace and freedom.  I
strongly believe that what we're doing today will make it easier for this
person's grandchild to grow up in a free world and a peaceful world.
     I'll tell you an interesting story, kind of dawned on me a while ago.  I
was talking to Prime Minister Koizumi of Japan in Tokyo -- we were having
dinner, actually.  And I kind of reflected on what it would be like -- during
our dinner, I reflected on what it would be like if America and the allies
hadn't done a good job in post-World War II, would I be sitting with a Prime
Minister of Japan, with whom I've got great relations, talking about how to deal
with Kim Jong-il and North Korea?  It's an interesting thought.
     Q    Very interesting.
     THE PRESIDENT:  Beyond that is whether or not somebody 50 years from now is
going to be sitting with a leader from Iraq, or any other country in that
region, saying, "Thank goodness George W. and Tony Blair held the line, because
I'm now able to deal with terrorist threats or potential terrorist threats with
an ally; I'm able to help bring more peace to the world."
     Presidents and Prime Ministers should never worry about their short-term
history, how they're viewed in short-term history.  There's no such thing as
short-term history, except for the musings of somebody who's not very objective
to begin with.  Because if you set big goals and work on big items, the
President or the Prime Minister won't be around to see the effects of those
policies.  And, therefore, I don't worry about the short-term history.  I think
in terms of long-term history I know what we're doing now is going to have an
effect, a positive effect on this world.
     Q    Can I just backtrack a little?
     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.
     Q    You were talking earlier about the contributions countries like
Britain and Italy have made and others.
     THE PRESIDENT:  Spain, Poland, a lot of people.
     Q    You didn't mention France and Germany in that -- you seem very
critical of France.
     THE PRESIDENT:  Look, my attitude is the past is there, it's past, and now
let's go on.  I'll tell you one example of why that attitude is important, and
that is Germany's contribution in Afghanistan.  And it's a positive contribution

No. 02-17077
UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
October 7, 2003, Argued and Submitted, San Francisco, California
November 18, 2003, Filed
PRIOR HISTORY:  [*1]  Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. D.C. No. CV 97-1109 CW. Claudia Wilken, District Judge, Presiding.
TASHIMA, Circuit Judge:
Defendants-Appellants, the California Department of Corrections and various prison officials (collectively, "CDC"), appeal an order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee, Todd Lewis Ashker, and issuing a permanent injunction against CDC. Ashker, a state prisoner housed in the Security Housing Unit ("SHU") at Pelican Bay State Prison ("PBSP"), challenged a prison policy requiring books and magazines mailed to the prison to have an approved vendor label affixed to [*2]  the package. In a published opinion, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Ashker because the policy unreasonably burdened Ashker's First Amendment rights and was not rationally related to a legitimate penological objective. Ashker v. Cal. Dep't of Corr., 224 F. Supp. 2d 1253, 1262 (N.D. Cal. 2002). The court further held that Ashker was entitled to injunctive relief and issued a permanent injunction enjoining PBSP from enforcing the book label requirement. Id. at 1263-64. Our jurisdiction is pursuant to 28 U.S.C. '' 1291 and 1292(a). n1 We affirm.
Glen Rodman, a sergeant at PBSP in Receiving and Release ("R&R"), explained that the majority of SHU inmates are involved in gang activity and are therefore likely to receive contraband in the mail, such as books containing drugs or encrypted with gang messages. All items received by PBSP are inspected for contraband and may further be inspected by a fluoroscope machine. Because such machines cannot detect encrypted material, the book label requirement is an additional security measure designed "to help ensure that reading material comes directly from the vendor, as opposed to passing through an unknown third party." According to Rodman, "an additional purpose served by the book label requirement is to reduce the amount of material that is required to be individually screened by" the three R&R staff members who are responsible for tracking the mail, searching it for contraband, and delivering approved materials to inmates.
We agree with the district court that the evidence submitted by both Ashker and CDC "refutes any common-sense connection between the book label policy and PBSP's legitimate goals of ensuring against contraband and providing prison safety." Ashker, 224 F. Supp. 2d at 1260. When the inmate presents such evidence, the state is required to "'present enough counter-evidence to show that the connection is not so remote as to render the policy arbitrary or irrational.'" Prison Legal News, 238 F.3d at 1150 (quoting Frost, 197 F.3d at 357). CDC has failed to do so.
First, CDC already [*12]  requires that books be sent directly from approved vendors. As the district court reasoned, prison staff can easily determine whether packages have been sent directly by vendors or have been sent to a third party first by checking address labels and invoices. See Ashker, 224 F. Supp. 2d at 1261. If the package had been sent to a third party, who then sent the package to the prisoner, the vendor's address label and invoice would indicate that fact. Requiring R&R staff to check the address label seems no more burdensome than requiring them to check for the vendor label and the vendor stamp in the appropriate box on the label. CDC has presented no evidence or argument to refute this reasoning.
Second, all personal property received by inmates in the mail is searched prior to delivery. CDC contends that these searches are not always effective, pointing out that contraband has been missed due to human error. However, "CDC [has] articulated no scenario in which the book label policy provides a measure of security not afforded by these routine and mandatory searches." Id. CDC further argues that the fluoroscope machine does not detect weapons or encrypted messages.  [*13]  That the lack of a book label can act as a sort of "red flag," alerting prison staff to books sent by non-vendors when their routine search may have missed this fact may be a legitimate concern, but it is a concern that is quite lacking in substantial evidentiary support. The district court pointed out that Sergeant Rodman "provided absolutely no specific facts regarding the alleged incident" in which drugs escaped the detection of the fluoroscope machine, id., and, on appeal, CDC has pointed to no evidence in the record regarding the efficacy of the book label policy.
Finally, at least with respect to contraband, there is no rational basis for CDC to impose an approved vendor label requirement on books, but not on tennis shoes, thermal clothing, or appliances. CDC has made no effort to explain why books are more susceptible to being used to deliver contraband than other items. "Common sense would dictate that PBSP's concern would extend to such items." Id. at 1262. Because the book label policy fails the first Turner factor, we do not address the other factors. n4 Morrison, 261 F.3d at 901.

We have recognized that, HN6[]under appropriate exigent circumstances, strict compliance with the knock and announce requirement may be excused. United States v. Grogins, 163 F.3d 795, 797 (4th Cir. 1998) (holding no-knock entry justified where officers had reasonable suspicion that entering drug "stash house" would be dangerous and drug dealer frequenting house could not be found elsewhere). When the authorities "have a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence ...would be dangerous or futile, or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of []crime by, for example, allowing the destruction of the evidence," an entry without knocking [*13]  is justified. Richards, 520 U.S. at 394; see also United States v. Ramirez, 523 U.S. 65, 140 L. Ed. 2d 191, 118 S. Ct. 992 (1998) (upholding no-knock entry where suspect had violent past, access to weapons, and vowed not to do "federal time").
In this situation, the state court judge made a specific determination that the circumstances explained in the Overfield Affidavit justified the issuance of a no-knock search warrant. As the Overfield Affidavit recounts, Wardrick had a violent criminal history, including a battery conviction stemming from resisting arrest. Moreover, the affidavit suggested that Wardrick, a convicted felon, illegally possessed firearms. Indeed, Wardrick had threatened, in the presence of Det. Overfield, that he always carried a loaded gun and that he "never missed." Lastly, Det. Overfield reasonably believed that Wardrick would be present when the warrant was executed. As the Overfield Affidavit reflects, several records indicated that 1808 Division Street was Wardrick's primary residence, and two automobiles registered in his name had been parked outside the residence only days before the search warrant was secured.
Based on [*14]  our review of the Overfield Affidavit, we agree with the district court that it was reasonable for Det. Overfield and the state court to believe that execution of the search warrant would be dangerous. See Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23, 40-41 n. 12, 10 L. Ed. 2d 726, 83 S. Ct. 1623 (1963) HN7[](determining lawfulness of entry depends on "what the officers had reason to believe at the time of their entry") (emphasis in original). In such circumstances, the issuance of the no-knock search warrant was justified, and the district court did not err in declining to suppress the evidence on this basis.

Query: What, nowadays, is *not* a "threat to homeland security?"
1. Airport drug bust heightens debate over non-federal forces
By Chris Strohm
A recent drug bust at Kennedy International Airport shows that the use
of workers from private companies in sensitive security jobs poses a
substantial risk, federal airport screeners argued Monday.
Government agents arrested 20 baggage and cargo handlers at Kennedy last
Tuesday and charged them with slipping tens of millions of dollars worth
of cocaine and marijuana past security checkpoints during the last
decade. Authorities said the workers were employed by American Airlines,
Delta Airlines, United Airlines and five smaller companies: Globe Ground
North American, Evergreen Eagle, Hudson General, Swissport USA and
Flying Foods.
The operation represented "a potential threat to homeland security,"
said Michael Garcia, acting head of the Bureau of Immigration and
Customs Enforcement.

@_subject: Larry Lessig on ending anonymity through "identity escrow" 
In response to:
To preserve freedom further, suggests Mr Lessig, anonymity could be
replaced by pseudonymity. It might become legal, for instance, to have
credit cards for online transactions under different names, as long as
these could still be traced to the individual owner. The challenge is to
set the legal hurdles for online search warrants high enough so that
governments cannot abuse their power. But at the same time to keep them low
enough so that criminals can be found and stopped. In this respect, the
online world should be no different from the real one.
It's not an inaccurate quote, but it is taken out of context.
What I said was that the trend in our laws was to destroy any privacy at all -- that the idiocy of Patriot Acts, etc., was effectively eliminating any form of privacy. There are two kinds of responses to this -- one to try to defend and build a system protecting absolute anonymity; the second is to build effective protections for pseudonymous life, which is shorthand for traceable transactions, but where the permission to trace is protected by something like a warrant requirement. I'm not saying the government should build these systems, but that they should be permitted and indeed In my view, we will make no progress following path one, but that we would strongly advance privacy if we could advance path two. A strong ethic and architecture of pseudonymous identity, properly protected, would give us more privacy than we have today.
Of course, it is possible (and probably likely) that such an architecture would not properly protect the link between a transaction and the privacy of a person. Government officials, for example, upon mere suspicion would be able to break the link, etc. That of course is not what I am promoting. I would promote a regime where the gov't required a very strong warrant-like reason before it could break the code that makes the link. But I will not that the baseline from which we're starting is a world where no real showing is necessary for this sort of surveillance.

     [Why do I get the feeling that Larry Lessig doesn't like "absolute" anonymity much at all? Systems for building and defending "absolute" anonymity already exist in the form of anonymous remailers and Freenet, among others. It would be foolish to follow Larry's advice and concede too quickly that such technologies have so few legitimate uses that they cannot be reasonably defended. Even the oft-benighted Eurocrats have recognized this: a 1997 EC directive encourages anonymity, as does a German federal law ( In the U.S., since the Federalist Papers were published with effectively "absolute" pseudonymity, surely the framers of the U.S. Constitution had them in mind when crafting the Bill of Rights. Justice Thomas lists more contemporaneous examples in his McIntyre concurrence ( Saying anonymous technologies are indefensible concedes a crucial point: that the government's power is so sweeping that police have the right to learn our identity in all cases. So much for whistleblowing and anonymous reports of public brutality.
Perhaps more to the point, the twin privacy-encroaching technologies of automated electronic surveillance and efficient large-scale databases did not exist decades or centuries ago. "Absolute" anonymity lets us reclaim some of that lost zone of privacy. Lastly, trying to remove "absolute" anonymity from the Internet (banning strong encryption and computers that can be programmed not to keep logs) would be far more disruptive, destructive, and harmful than proposals like Hollings' CBDTPA that Larry has rightly opposed. --Declan]

@_subject: [Politech] John Gilmore on the homeless, RFID tags, 
Last year I found it almost impossible to adopt a kitten or cat that
didn't have an RFID tag implanted under its skin.  The city animal
shelter and the SPCA both "chip" all their animals -- and pet
hospitals who offer adoption get all their pets from these shelters.
The people we spoke with in the shelters were confused by our
opposition to their "safe, sane, and humane" policy of RFID-tracking
every animal that came within chip-gun range of them.  When a cat is
lost, they scan 'em like a bag of potato chips, pull 'em up in the
database, and call their owner.
Eventually by reading the bulletin boards in pet stores, we found a
local Mexican family who had two litters of kittens.  They had been
born at home and never subjected to "chipping".  Our kittens are now
grown and healthy (and untracked).
I would not be a bit surprised to see bureaucrats at any level
advocating RFID tracking of the homeless.  They're already taking
blood samples of every newborn, storing them away "just in case we
ever need to check their DNA".  And giving every infant their own
Social Security Number, just to make sure they get tracked from birth
to death.  A kitten or an infant who comes to the attention of the
authorities can't tell you who they are or where they belong.  So why
not chip the homeless, who frequently can't or won't answer the same
question?  It's a fair question.  What's YOUR answer?
PS:  If Larry Hiibel had had a chip implanted in him, Deputy Dove wouldn't
have had to arrest him.  This would have saved the Supreme Court some work.

Just did a Lexis-Nexis search. One early reference is a Washington Times
article on July 27, 1989:
"I don't know that atheists should be considered citizens, nor should
they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God," said
Mr. Bush, as reported in the November issue of American Atheist
A LA Times letter to the editor in July 1990:
And what the head of his party, then-Vice President George Bush, told
a Chicago airport press conference in August, 1987: "I don't know that
atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be
considered as patriots. This is one nation under God."
A letter to the editor to the Post-Standard (Syracuse) in March 1989:
To President Bush:I understand that you are on tape saying, "I don't
know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they
be considered as patriots. This is one nation under God."
UPI April 1990:
While campaigning in 1987, President Bush was quoted by a reporter for
an Atheist publication as saying, '''I guess I'm pretty weak in the
Atheist community. My belief in God is important to me,''' O'Hair
said. ''He said, and again this is verbatim, 'I don't know if atheists
should be considered citizens. ... This is one nation under God.'''
So there's no definitive reference in the database.

FYI here's something I wrote in April... --Declan
If Google wanted to veer in a more privacy-protective direction, it
could look to the intriguing model of Vancouver, Canada-based Hush
Communications, which runs the Hushmail Web mail system. Unlike
rivals, Hush encrypts mail sent between Hush users. It uses a
Java-based technique that allows for only its intended recipient--and
not Hush employees--to decrypt a scrambled e-mail message. If a
subpoena arrives, or if a security breach ever happens, disclosure
would be limited.
Hush offers 2-megabyte-limit free accounts and pay accounts, and it
said 900,000 accounts have been created since its May 1999 launch. The
company also lets users store files in an encrypted volume and this
week plans to announce a feature that permits encrypted volumes to be
shared among multiple users.
Hush's patent No. 6,154,543 covers some aspects of encrypted
e-mail. The company said it'd happy to license it to
Google. Originally, Hush Chief Technology Officer Brian Smith said,
the patent was quite broad, but "we have narrowed the patent to apply
only to e-mail and messaging systems. The modifications were accepted
but don't yet appear" on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Web
True, if the archived e-mail is encrypted, Gmail won't be able to
search message bodies very efficiently, but users might be willing to
give up that feature and even pay a monthly charge in exchange for
additional security.
"We'll think about it," said Google's Rosing. "We don't have any
explicit plans right now...If someone really needs to encrypt a lot of
e-mail, maybe they should be putting that on their laptop. We're
trying to provide a service that offers some utility to our users. If
you change the service to take away all the value of the service,
you're back where you started."
Maybe. But until that happens, would-be users of Gmail or any similar
service should recognize that their so-called free e-mail comes at a

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 2, 2004

  Turner: The Terrorists Are Among Us
Congressman Jim Turner, Ranking Member of the Select Committee on Homeland Security, issued the following statement regarding continued terror warnings in the Northeast and the President's announcements today:
The threats on New York, New Jersey and Washington DC serve as a reminder that the terrorists are among us here at home.  We have no idea how many more are still in this country surveying our ports, chemical plants and public transportation. We must assume there are other targets beyond the 5 buildings being protected today.
The President's announcement endorsing the creation of a Director of National Intelligence is a step in the right direction, but long overdue.  The recommendation was made over 18 months ago by the Congressional Joint Inquiry.  The 9/11 Commission report makes it clear that we have not moved fast enough to protect this country and have not closed the security gaps that threaten us today.
It is critical that we move forward to provide stronger homeland security and that we do it with great haste. Our terrorist enemies will not wait, and neither can we.

An MIT student named Star Simpson was apparently picking up a friend at Boston Logan airport and wore a sweatshirt with a breadboard and some LEDs and a 9V battery. She had created it for a student career day.
Big mistake. She was nearly killed by police (armed with semiautomatic weapons that some jurisdictions prevent law-abiding Americans from owning) who surrounded her. State Police Maj. Scott Pare actually told the press that she was "extremely lucky she followed the instructions or deadly force would have been used... She's lucky to be in a cell as opposed to the morgue."
Star was charged with violating the state's hoax device/infernal machine law, which shows you just how officious -- and perhaps even crazed -- police and prosecutors are nowadays. That law provides up to five years in prison.
As I wrote back in February after the Aqua Teen Hunger Force incident, for prosecutors to win their case, they must prove that (1) Star transported the LED-sweatshirt (2) "with the intent to cause anxiety, unrest, fear or personal discomfort." (3) Also, a person must "reasonably" believe that the LED-sweatshirt was (4) a "device for endangering life or doing unusual damage to property, or both, by fire or explosion." See:
Obviously the state will lose this case, but filing charges is more politically convenient than admitting the cops made an error, or at the very least admitting that the student was just wearing a harmless sweatshirt. Here are the "infernal machine" cases in which the state *did* win -- when the devices actually were dangerous:
