@_subject: HELLO 
(CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL)
DEAR PARTNER,
IN ORDER TO TRANSFER OUT ( FIFTEEN-MILLION POUNDS
STERLINGS) FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. I HAVE THE
COURAGE TO LOOK FOR A RELIABLE AND HONEST PERSON WHO
WILL BE CAPABLE FOR THIS IMPORTANT TRANSACTION,
BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NEVER LET ME DOWN EITHER NOW
OR IN FUTURE.
I AM MR LARRY BODRICKS THE AUDITOR AND COMPUTING STAFF
OF A BANK HERE IN SCOTLAND UNITED KINGDOM. THERE IS AN
ACCOUNT OPENED IN THIS BANK IN 1995 AND SINCE 2001
NOBODY HAS OPERATED ON THIS ACCOUNT AGAIN,
AFTER GOING THROUGH SOME OLD FILES INTHE RECORDS,
I DISCOVERED THAT IF I DO NOT REMITT THIS MONEY
OUT URGENTELY, IT WILL BE FORFEITED FOR NOTHING.
HOW THE MONEY CAME ABOUT:
THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS MR JOHN HUGHES FOREIGNER
FROM AND THE MANAGER OF PETROL CHEMICAL SERVICE HERE IN
LONDON,A CHEMICAL ENGINEER BY PROFFESSION AND HE DIED
SINCE 1995.AND THEN,SINCE 2001, NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT THIS
ACCOUNT OR ANYTHING CONCERNING IT, THE ACCOUNT HAS NO
OTHER BENEFICIARY AND MY INVESTIGATION PROVED TO ME AS
WELL THAT HIS COMPANY DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THIS ACCOUNT AND THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS (15,000,000.00)
POUNDS STERLINGS.
I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN
ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER, I AM
ONLY CONTACTING YOU AS A FOREIGNER BECAUSE THIS
MONEY CAN NOT BE APPROVED TO ANY LOCAL BANK HERE IN
SCOTLAND,BUT CAN ONLY BE APPROVED TO ANY FOREIGN
ACCOUNT BECAUSE THE MONEY IS POUNDS STERLINGS AND
THE FORMER OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT IS JOHN HUGHES
AND HE WAS A FOREIGNER TOO.
I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A
SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW OUR SELF BEFORE,
BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS.I
BELIEVE IN GOD THAT YOU WILL NEVER LET ME DOWN IN
THIS INVESTMENT.
WHEN THE TRANSFER IS APPROVED AND PAYMENT SCHEDULE IS
ALOCATED OVERSEAS,THROUGH THE OFFSHORE
PAYING DELEGATE FOR FINAL CLEARANCE AND SIGNING OF
THE PAYMENT REALEASE FORM BY THE BENEFICIARY, I
WANT US TO SEE AT THE OVERSEA PAYING CLEARANCE OFFICE
FACE TO FACE OR SIGNING OF THE ORIGINAL BINDDING
AGREEMENT TO BIND US TOGETHER SO THAT,WE CAN RECEIVE
THIS MONEY INTO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT OR ANY ACCOUNT OF
YOUR CHOICE WHERE THE FUND WILL BE REMITTED.
I AM CONTACTING YOU BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO INVOLVE A
FOREIGNER WITH A FOREIGN ACCOUNT AS THE
REAL BENEFICIARY. I NEED YOUR CO-OPERATION TO MAKE
THIS WORK FINE, BECAUSE THE MANAGEMENT IS READY
TO APPROVE THIS PAYMENT TO ANY FOREIGNER WHO HAS THE
CORRECT INFORMATION TO THIS ACCOUNT,WHICH I WILL
GIVE TO YOU WHEN SURE OF YOUR CAPABILITY TO HANDLE
SUCH AMOUNT IN STRICT CONFIDENCE AND TRUST.
ACCORDING TO MY INSTRUCTIONS AND MY ADVICE FOR OUR
MUTUAL BENEFIT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
ANY MISTAKE,I NEED YOUR STRONG ASSURANCE AND TRUST.I
SHALL DESTROY ALL DOCUMENTS CONCERNING THIS
TRANSACTIONS IMMEDIATELY WE RECEIVED THIS MONEY
LEAVING NO TRACE TO ANY PLACE.
I WILL USE MY POSITION AND INFLUENCE ON OTHER STAFFS
TO EFFECT THE LEGAL APPROVALS AND ONWARD TRANSFER OF
THIS MONEY TO YOUR ACCOUNT WITH APPROPRIATE CLEARANCE
FROM FOREIGN PAYMENT DEPARTMENT. WITH ASSURANCE THAT
THIS MONEY WILL BE INTACT PENDING MY PHYSICAL ARRIVAL
TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR THE SHARING AND OTHER INVESTMENT.
HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU IMMEDIATELY.
