As others suggested, it's likely that your image is corrupt.  Before
burning it, you should have checked if the md5 sum is correct.  Also, I
suspect that you burned the iso file as a normal file to a cd, rather
than burning it as an _image_ to the cd.
P.S.: If you like, email me in person or stop by in the lab at some point and
I'll give you a good cd.  Or you can drop off your machine here and I'll
install it (though this would deprive you off the fun and the
learning-process of installing the system yourself).
