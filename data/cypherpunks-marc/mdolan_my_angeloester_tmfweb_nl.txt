***This is a Keep On Truckin’ Company Alert***
According to a study by the Argonne National Laboratory’s Transportation   Technology R&D Center, long haul trucks idling overnight consume more than   1.2 billion gallons of fuel annually. Additionally, over 11 million tons of   CO2 and 150,000 tons of NOX are emitted into the atmosphere each year from idling   trucks. The study goes on to say that the implementation of auxiliary power   units may have the ability to reduce this fuel consumption, but also harmful   emissions by more than 80% per year as well as significantly reducing long term   equipment truck maintenance costs. New Federal Regulations now prohibit idling   and as many as 20 individual states have direct anti-idling laws on the books.
  The Government is sending a message to the trucking industry:   Spare the Environment from harmful emissions!   $$$ Stop Engine Idling $$$   It’s the Law!
WHY EENT SHOULD BE ON YOUR RADAR: 1. EENT has developed a great product with an established need that has recently   been mandated by the Federal Government! (When the Government’s supports   your products solution in the marketplace, you have a huge advantage! < That's   our opinion.)
  2. The Company’s product, the AXP-1000, is smaller, lighter, quieter,   more powerful, more reliable, less expensive and easier to install than any   competitive offering in its product category. (In our opinion these are the   kinds of characteristics that win the hearts and minds of customers!)
3. The Trucking industry is huge and is estimated at 676 Billion dollars! EENT   is in a fantastic position to get their piece of the trucking pie! The market   segment EENT is a part of is showing remarkable growth of approximately $40   million per year! (Growth! Even a small % of the overall market is big money!)
4. The U.S. Dept. of Energy has estimated yearly savings per truck utilizing   an auxiliary generator solution (like the AXP 1000) would produce approximately   $7,700 per year (including fuel savings, preventative truck maintenance and   overhauls) in savings. Additionally, engine idling non-compliance fines from   the DOT & EPA can be as high as $250 to $5,000 per citation. Trucking companies   are looking to save money and EENT has a solution! (How do you make money? Solve   a problem and sell the solution!) 5. The Company has invested over two million dollars invested in the past two   years into this technology. Now the product is ready to go! (No more waiting,   the time is now. EENT is a serious player in this market.)
  6. EENT has filed four provisional United States Patent Applications for their   proprietary technology within the AXP 1000, which are currently pending. (Intellectual   Property protection is critical to protecting the Company’s position and   thwarting potential competitors from entering the market!)
  7. There are over 500,000+ Class 8 trucks on the roads. Approximately 80,000   new Class 8 trucks hit the roads every year. Trucking operators that use these   trucks need EENT’s technology if they want to save money! (Huge market,   largely untapped! Until now!)
8. EENT management is continuing to move forward more aggressively with its   marketing activities. The Company and their product have been featured at several   large trucking expositions and in dominant industry publications, with measurable   success! (There is a buzz in the air and people in the trucking industry are   taking notice!)
  9. The company is already in negotiation and consideration for product testing   with several major national trucking fleets.
  10. EENT has a forward looking, tenacious and tactical CEO and President. (He   has delivered so far and only sees things getting better!)
11. EENT management is working with Wall Street and other financial and marketing   experts to help grow the company and has set an ambitious but reachable goal   of being an American Stock Exchange Company in a year. (Management wants to   reward the Company and its shareholders by improving its position in the public   markets!)
12. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Wind Dancer Aviation Services,   is an example of the company’s diversification plan. The Company just   announced that it has acquired STC assets from another company in the Aviation   Services space that will dramatically improve their position. (Management is   making progress in all aspects of the Company’s growth!)
13. In our opinion this company has so many things going for it we don’t   have room to list them all! There is much more information on their website   which you can find by reading any of their press releases.
COMPANY OVERVIEW;
Energy and Engine Technologies, Inc (OTCBB: EENT) is a Plano, Texas-based concern   which, among other things, develops and markets auxiliary power generators for   the long haul trucking industry. The company is pursuing an integrated strategy   to establish a significant technological presence in the domestic U.S. transportation   industry.   ABOUT THEIR FLAGSHIP PRODUCT THE AXP 1000:
The AXP 1000 is an auxiliary power generator. Most long haul trucks run their   engine in idle even while parked for rest periods. The AXP 1000 is an answer   to this expensive practice.
The AXP 1000 is a device designed for new installation and retrofit to semi   truck tractors, which provides power generation without running the truck engine.   AXP 1000 maintains the battery power and powers the cab thereby reducing fuel   consumption, pollution and long term truck maintenance costs. It also powers   the “creature comforts” for the truck cab without depleting the   vehicle battery or running the engine.
The Company is currently mobilizing its resources to concentrate on small fleets   and independent truck owner operators, typically customers with 1-300 trucks   each. Currently, EENT has initiated sales efforts with over 50 customers in   this small to mid-size market.
SOME THINGS TO CONSIDER:
The AXP 1000 has been well received by the trucking press and has had a great   deal of interest shown in it.
  The Company successfully launched the AXP 1000 at the Mid America Truck Show   in Louisville, KY in March 2003. Recently EENT was featured in the America Trucking   On the Road Magazine booth, EENT experienced high customer exposure for the   AXP 1000 and made contact with several new potential distributors and installation   facilities. EENT will again team up with On the Road at the Mid America Truck   Show in March 2004 in Louisville, KY. EENT was also featured in Fleet Owner Magazine's September 2003 special industry   report on anti-idling called "Turn Idle Time into Cash". This bi-   annual report should reach Fleet Owner's estimated 103,000 circulation.
  The AXP 1000 solves not only economic problems, but also environmental ones.   Trucks burn a considerable amount of diesel fuel when idling and release harmful   emissions into the atmosphere. The AXP 1000 also cuts down on noise pollution. It is significantly quieter   than an idling diesel engine.
For each 1,000 AXP 1000 units sold, EENT generates gross revenue of approximately   $5,000,000 and net revenue of approximately $1,000,000. There are over 500,000   Class 8 sleeper trucks in the U.S. today. Each represents a potential customer   for the AXP 1000.
Each AXP 1000 cost approximately $5,500.00, considerably less than competing   solutions that sell for $6,000 - $10,000 per unit.
  According to the Kelly Blue Book for trucks, the resale value for a truck which   has an auxiliary power device installed is increased by approximately $4500.
President and CEO, Will McAndrew said about their focus becoming known in Wall   Street circles:
"In order to meet our business goals and to take maximum advantage of   the capital markets, it is essential that Wall Street be introduced to EENT   and learn about our exciting opportunities. I can think of no better introduction   than to meet in person with various firms in the New York area and am excited   about the potential opportunities in this area.”
