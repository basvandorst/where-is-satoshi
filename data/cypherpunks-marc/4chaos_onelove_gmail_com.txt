All "speech" should be legal--printed, electronic, or otherwise--even guides to making bombs like the Anarchist Cookbook, of which I have a copy. Anyone who doesn't support that doesn't deserve freedom of speech. I understand limits to speech being necessary to prevent imminent harm (when there is evidence of clear and present danger) like yelling fire in a crowded theater. However, this logic has been overextended and abused to the point where less-than-clear danger and just potential risk are enough to justify censorship of unpopular political speech. One more reason to nix the Terrorism Act.

Can someone please give me your appraisal of Signal. I'm not noticing the red flags that we see all too often in such sales pitches.

Media I saw reported that the personnel info published was all publicly
available. Thus the intent was to create the impression that networks were
compromised. Govt line however is that the info was not confidential. I
haven't done any research however to confirm even the face validity of that.

Anyone else checked out the footage that surfaced of the Apollo 11
astronauts pretending to be far away when they are really in low Earth
The effect they are going for can be seen at 53:14 to make it seem
like the camera is up against the window and Earth is small. How they
did it is revealed much earlier in the film. You see someone between
the camera and the Earth and realize what you thought was the
blackness of space is really the inside of the craft and what you
though was the entire Earth is just a small window showing part of a
huge Earth right outside the window. (This is covered in a doc you can
also find on youtube called A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the
Moon.) There is other funny business in the rest of this "behind the
scenes footage." Not sure what to make of it if the moon landing
wasn't faked.
