Hello Jamie, thanks for the reply and sorry to hear the situation is not an isolated case. Actually, I have not had a bounce from (or through) the webmin ml (yet). I am subscribed to 5 sourceforge mls and now it appears I will have to unsubscribe from those too (which is of course what the SPAMMER wants). The SPAM contains a virus (or the remotely affected SMTPd anti-virus software thinks so) and as such the SPAM email is bouncing back to the list subscribers. I was not able to message the gphoto list admin so I had no choice but to unsubscribe. I hope the SPAMMER does not get to the webmin list. I can only hope this situation gets escalated to the attention of sourceforge. Thanks, David.
