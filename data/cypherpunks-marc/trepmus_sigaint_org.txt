I think you misinterpreted me, I am not defending planned economy, The
cooperation that I was referring to is between market agents to form
cartels and extract the most value from their product. The mathematical
fact comes from game theory. There is a strong incentive for market agents
to collude and control the price. Once one small group of cartels controls
the market, it is impossible to other agents to enter.
It is an honest question. I am an anarchist myself but cannot think of a
solution to this problem without regulation.

How do you cope with the mathematical fact that, in general, cooperative
strategies are more efficient than competitive ones?
I know of a place that for the past three decades have had one of the most
unregulated markets in the world (if not the most). The tendency has been
that over time the market becomes concentrated in fewer and fewer people
that form cartels and use the concentrated power to prevent new actors
from entering the market. Currently, and thanks to a few whistleblowers,
it is known that the economic cartels have even bought the government and
the parliament, having government officials and members of the parliament
in its payroll.
