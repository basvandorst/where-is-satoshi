How did you get the mic to work?
I still have Fedora 10 on my laptop
$ yum list skype*
Installed Packages
skype.i586                         2.1.0.81-fc10                          $ yum list libv4l*
Installed Packages
libv4l.i386                           0.6.2-1.fc10                      in .bashrc:
alias skype='LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libv4l/v4l1compat.so /usr/bin/skype'
I have not gotten mic to work.
Thank you
