News in a country where newspapers full of the following headlines are published are not to be taken by face value:
- The eiffel tower was buit by a chinese
- Edison stole the electric light from a chinese
blah, blah, blah...
A friend of mine (who is married to a singapurean and speaks fluent mandarin and cantonese) when in her first trip to china, found these newspapers with this prepostorous claims. She bought several of them to shown to her In the chinese customs she had them confiscated...
Cultural propaganda against western values and achievements.

(Actualy, in the dark ages, it wasn't only one plague.. it was several plagues (mutants and new pathogens) that spread wavelike through europe... the populations died mainly because of sistematically reduced imunity)
