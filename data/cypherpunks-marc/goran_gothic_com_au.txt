I don't mind calling existing social systems as "alleged" - democracy or corporatrocracy or kleptocracy.
I don't agree with distorted descriptions of theoretical societies;
"oppressive government in communism" - oxymoron; it is a stateless society
"corrupted-money grabbing state in communism" - oxymoron; it is moneyless society
After all, an offer of "all natural cake made with unbleached flour and nothing but organic ingredients, baked in traditional way" would look less appealing if next to the label a statement says "may contain poisonous shit"...

Kleptocracy, alternatively cleptocracy or kleptarchy, (from Greek: ÎºÎ»Î­ÏÏÎ·Ï - kleptÄs, "thief"[1] and ÎºÏÎ¬ÏÎ¿Ï - kratos, "power, rule",[2] hence "rule by thieves") is a form of political and government corruption where the government exists to increase the personal wealth and political power of its officials and the ruling class at the expense of the wider population, often with pretense of honest service.
Communism (from Latin communis â common, universal)[1][2] is a socioeconomic system structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and characterized by the absence of social classes, money,[3][4] and the state; as well as a social, political and economic ideology and movement that aims to establish this social order.
Communism has not been ever put to practice.

I would say no;
What's left of what we call civilisation would decay much faster then
the airborne stuff.

And you reckon that there'll be an island to retire to in such case?
