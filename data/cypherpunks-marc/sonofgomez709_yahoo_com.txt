"After shrinks found Elledge competent, [William]
Jaquette [Elledge's Court Appointed Attorney] represented his
client's death wishes, which was difficult because of his
opposition to the death penalty.
  "Everybody in a free society, Jaquette says, has the
right to choose and direct his own defense."
~'Witness To An Execution,' Michael Hood
Seattle Weekly, September 6, 2001
  What a CrockOfShit!!!
  During my trial, Judge Robert Bryan forced Court
Counsel (Gene Grantham) upon me, against my wishes,
and the
"right to choose and direct [my] own defense,"
faster than Jalapenos screaming through a Rat's
  Contrary to all legal precedent, Judge Bryan decided
I was FitToBeTried, but not fit to represent myself,
the way for Court Appointed Counsel to refuse to mount
viable defense, and thus ThrowingMeToTheDogs.
  Three judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
declared a defendant's "right to choose and direct his
own defense" to be a LaughAbleJoke easily circumvented
the smallest of pretexes in the Ninth Circuit.
  Thus, Mr. Jaquette's lame excuse to having
his client as his professional ethics require" is
more than an obvious attempt to deny his own willing
complicity in the MURDER of his client.
  Would Mr. Jaquette have us believe that his ethics
of a higher than those of Judge Bryan and the members
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals?  That the Judges
the Ninth Circuit Court can ethically refuse a
charged with merely threating someone the "right to
choose and direct his own defense," but Mr. Jaquette
cannot ethically refuse to participate in the MURDER
of a client charged with murder?
  When Mr. Jaquette stated "the death penalty makes
killers of us all," he was obviously not speaking for
the Judges of the Ninth Circuit Court, but merely for
  I find it ironic that Mr. Elledge could be
MURDERED by his Court Appointed Attorney, but not by
the Ninth Circuit Judges who participated in my case,
since their view is that the 'right' Mr. Jaqauette
cites to excuse his complicity in the MURDER of his
client does not exist.
  I can't help but wonder if, had Elledge chosen
instead of injection, Mr. Jaquette would not have been
one of the 'witnesses' hollering, "Jump! Jump!"

  Precedent Bush, like all his FourFlushers in

a. Declared War on Ameri$a
b. Said they were going to Destroy Ameri%a
c. Attacked and killed Americans

  The Pentagon, the CIA, the FBI, and every

Defen$e of the %itizenry (e.g. gNuClear Missles On The Moon To Deter National Park

the "Attack On Ameri%a" that is Fueling the

been prevented merely by *using* a few dozen

@_subject: The True Story Of The Attack On America 
************ A SPECIAL REPORT BY ************
"The World's Lamest Conspiracy Theorist" [TM]
  My early Report that the gNu World Order Trade
Center Attack was Planned&OR&Perpetrated by "the
same guys who 'done' the Kennedy's" *did* turn out
to be Total BullShit, but RecentRevelations have
brought PositiveProof that ThisHalfWit [TM] was on
the right HalfTrack, all along.
  It turns out that the TwinTowerTragedy was the
end result of a new Promotional Campaign for the
reemergence of 'George' magazine, in which the
Pilots of the HiJacked AirPlanes were supposed
to 'Buzz' the WTC, creating a BigStir, with an
accompanying Malestrom of Publicity.
  Unfortunately, the MasterMinds of 'George'
magazine's Promotional Campaign had no better
sense than to use Pilots that were trained by
John F. Kennedy Jr. They were quite simply just
Lousy Pilots, Eh?
  Thus the "Attack On Ameri%a" is shown to be
nothing more than yet another effort by the MainStreamDream NotReallyNews Media to CoverUp
yet another Grandoise FuckUp by the Kennedys,
as has been going on ever since Jackie 'offed' Jack in Dallas and was Prevented from Escaping
out the back of the Presidential Limosine by the
Secret Service Agent who wrestled her back into
the vehicle and placed her under Arrest, only
to later be Accused of Groping the First Lady,
in order to ShutHimTheFuckUp! [See the "Lone
GunWoman Theory" Conspiracy Paper of Nov. 23,
  Meanwhile, Osama Been Bomb'in has been quoted
as speculating that the RealReason Ameri%ans
keep Observing A Minute Of Silence is that
they know that Allah doesn't listen to the
Prayers of InFidels, anyway.
  And, speaking of Moments Of Silence, I have
learned from a SemiReputable Lame Conspiracy
Source that George 'WhiteLine' Bush's suggestion
during a Security Council meeting that those
present could show Ameri%an %itizens their
Resolve to Respond Quickly&OR&Strongly to the
"Attack On Ameri%a" by "going out and beating
up some A-RAB CabDrivers" was met by an
mBareAssIng Silence, with 'DubyaEl' being
deterred from this plan only by Dick Chaney
reminding him, "We did that *last* week..."

Old-Subject: NPR Story Yesterday
A writer for the Voice ( if I heard it correctly ) talked about a
computer captured in Manila that was supposedly used by Ramzi Yousef. He
said that there were documents that described hijacking planes and
flying them into prominent buildings.
This information was turned over to the FBI in 1995 or 1996.
I hope with expanded powers for surveillance and searches that they can
gather better information and shorten the analysis period.
Let's see...
THEY [TM] use ECHELON to listen to every electronic message in
the history of the world...
THEY [TM] have apparently already had advance information about
all of the UnForSeen Tragedies that have occurred lately...
THEY [TM] have failed to protect US&OR&U.S. from known threats,
known enemies, known terrorist plans, yet they are using Their
failure to do so as an excuse for needing to exercise even more
intrusion into our privacy and constitutional rights...
Next thing you know, THEY [TM] will be telling us they need to
raise taxes, because they wasted the money we already gave
them...or has this already happened? (I've been...uuhhh..away...)
