I can't speak to the others, but for this one:
There could be at least four reasons:
1) they don't believe it.
They're just throwing ideas at the wall, to see who will do free work
for them.  They wouldn't spend a dime of their own money to do it.
2) lack of capital
They think it's a good idea, but don't have the funds to
allocate/acquire the manpower to get it done.  If only they were better
at raising money they'd get it done.
Summer of Code, perhaps other outlets for these folks?
3) ideological inefficiency
They think it's a tor feature, Tor Project alone should do it, even if
they have the capital and believe the business case.  I trust in
individual self-interest too much to believe this is real.
4) Confusion
They'd do it themselves but it's not obvious what they need to do.
Being opaque, they work on other things first.
I suspect this is possible, so I started a wiki page that could, in a
future form, be useful to this class:
  It would be great if those with experience could add info/links here,
especially architectural elements with broad commonality among potential

The Fonera 2 might be a candidate platform.  Half the price, 32MB RAM,
built-in wifi, support for 3g modems.  IIRC, somebody already did a tor
mod for the first version.
A camouflaged case could be produced that would incorporate localized
power connectors.  Maybe even pass-through.
