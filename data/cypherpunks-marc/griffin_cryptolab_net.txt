  Blutmagie runs a quite in-depth listing of tor nodes (exit and
otherwise):   There are CSVs that can be polled to output just the IP addresses,
which should cut down on any programming time significantly.  Is it
possible to just consider all nodes "potential exits"?  There are only a
few thousand IPs in the entire network at any given moment, so it
shouldn't be a large undertaking.

  If it's possible to include a Tor Project certificate, perhaps it
would be better to do that and push updates to users.  That would allow
for shorter lag time between software updates and users receiving them. On the other hand, if Tor weren't used to update the browser bundle,

For me, no, because I enjoy using flash to play games and look at art

choose not to.  The trade-offs for me are performance, hassle, and the
fact that virtualbox won't run on my machine.   It's probably a bit off-topic, but in the next couple of months I plan
to get a dedicated Windows machine that is used only for testing and
gaming.  Lots of games have questionable components (flash-based and
otherwise).  Getting another machine the ultimate sandbox.  But you've
got to weigh cost, necessity, and (frankly) relative interest.  If I

  In addition to the other great recommendations, I'd highly recommend
blocking Flash if you're concerned about privacy.  Not only do flash
cookies persist longer / are hard to block / are harder to remove, but
it's easy to fingerprint someone via a tiny bit of flash.  Flash is also
enabled by default on Google Chrome, so check out FlashBlock [2]. It
also offers more granularity in case you like gaming :D

   Not exactly.  There are more moving parts to Apple signing certificates and keys than most people realize.
   The process for signing an app is: 1) generate a private key, 2) use that to generate a Certificate Signing Request (which you send to Apple), 3) Apple sends you the approved certificate (automated process), 4) convert that file to (.pem/.cer), 5) generate p12 file using that cert and your private key (and its password) together, 6) generate the provisioning file to actually build the signed app in xcode.
   While that seems like an arduous and in-depth process, getting signed malware only requires a $99 payment to Apple and a super basic "application process" to become an Apple developer.  One could probably get more mileage by distributing malware that disables signature check.

To be fair, literally no one who works on Tor or Tor-related projects is surprised.  This is addressed at nearly every talk, nearly every workshop, and people are pretty open about it as a feature of the landscape.  That most of these are low-speed exits is pretty telling.  Most bad exits are designed to inject/replace ads, which is pretty stupid.  If you catch someone doing this, share their ad code so they can be reported to ad networks and lose the money they were trying to make.
   However, the balance of probability has it that any given user is likely to be fine.  Enforce https and don't accept random certificate errors.  If you're getting a certificate error, click New Identity and you'll find that most magically disappear (and those that don't are typically issues with the website itself - don't patronize poorly-secured websites).
   What do I mean by "balance of probability"?  Well, if you use Tor, there's about a 90% chance you'll pass through an exit run by someone I know, and a quite good chance that you'll specifically exit through a Torservers node.
   My point being that the only real answer to this problem is network diversity.  If you're concerned about "spoiled onions," run a node!  Don't have the time/money/interest? Donate to Torservers or Nos Oignons or Noisetor so that they can run more exit nodes.

Bullshit or not?
  It has some interesting elements to it, and would be a step in the
right direction for more-secure app content storage.  Though at its
base, it has some conceptual flaws.  If you root the device, you can get
the private key.  By design, there's no way to put the key on external
media (there's only one external microSD slot, and that contains your
encrypted files).  Files could be cached once decrypted.  And of course
it doesn't prevent a Finfisher-style screenshot-taking backdoor from
just viewing what's displayed on the screen.
  That's not going into the quality of encryption (which remains to be
seen).  Conceal uses a stripped-down version of OpenSSL for its
encryption algorithms.  Still, could be fun. =)
"Caching and storage are tricky problems for mobile developers because
they directly impact performance and data usage on a mobile device.
Caching helps developers speed up their apps and reduce network costs
for the device owner by storing information directly on the phone for
later access. However, internal storage capacity on Android phones is
often limited, especially with lower to mid range phone models. A
common solution for Android is to store some data on an expandable SD
card to mitigate the storage cost. What many people don't realize is
that Android's privacy model treats the SD card storage as a publicly
accessible directory. This allows data to be read by any app (with the
right permissions). Thus, external storage is normally not a good
place to store private information.
We saw an opportunity to do things better and decided to encrypt the
private data that we stored on the SD card so that it would not be
accessible to other apps. To do this efficiently, we built Conceal, a
set of Java APIs to perform cryptography on Android and make storage
more secure and lightweight. We created Conceal to be small and faster
than existing Java crypto libraries on Android while using memory

Also keep in mind that it's possible to spy on who downloads these
just by seeding the torrent and monitoring connections to your box.  So
it's certainly not anonymous.  I'd say hidden service first, a website
second, and torrent third.

This is very useful, thanks for sharing.  I'd also add MATLAB to the list of tools used -- keep in mind that "intelligence analyst" is extremely broad as a descriptor.  Some of these people are low-level ex-military 35F types, some have a classical statistics research background, some are social scientists, some are dataviz experts, some are linguists.  So try to distinguish between these and offer sources when you can.

So, I ran a couple of quick tests, and checked for RC4... and got 1903 results for the Alexa Top 500.  Your theory about websites not switching back seems to hold water.
   It's a github repo, since apparently Github doesn't want me to create a 17000-line gist. (Fascists!)  Included are the list of supported cipher suites for 494/500 websites along with instructions on verifying/recreating the results:    The nmap command I used was: sudo nmap -sT -PN -p 443 -iL=alexa.csv --script=ssl-enum-ciphers.nse -oN=alexa_ciphers.txt
   Which only checks port 443. So if there's some magic port number you want to check (say, 9050 or 5222), be sure to swap that out first. If you want XML output, use -oX instead of -oN (and it's easy to convert xml to json if you're interested in data visualization).  The nmap script used was created by Bojan Zdrnja, praised be his name.

It's fairly straightforward to uncover someone's financial and public ties to various organizations by looking through public records.  But mentioning this possibility among peers is a bit of a conversation killer.  No one wants to risk invading the privacy of someone who doesn't deserve it (which is virtually everyone with NIST or IETF).
   Incidentally, when I mentioned this to a researcher who grew up in a horribly oppressive society, his response was "Why would you not do this kind of research?"  So then I was in the awkward position of explaining that A) most people care about their careers, B) people don't want to invade others' privacy, C) the risk of false-positives is non-zero.
   Do I think that people with suspicious financial ties should be outed?   Sure.  But no one wants to do that.  No one wants to be the messenger.
TL;DR: people love handrwringing, hate even mild risk.

Hey all,
   There's been a lot of discussion around warrant canaries lately, and I just want to pipe in with my experience.
   Back in 2012, I talked to my attorney about setting up a warrant canary or a dead man's switch -- which he pointed out would have the same legal repercussions as just releasing the gagged warrant/NSL.  Why?   Because they are frequently phrased in such a way that if you do or fail to do a thing to somehow make it known, then you've violated the order.  You're in just as much trouble if you take out a billboard or tweet a scan of the order or use pantomime or comment out a warrant    The only difference is that there *might* be plausible deniability if you tell your partner "something happened at work today and I can't tell you what it is" [1], whereas you have *no* ability to deny anything if you remove a publicized warrant canary from a website.  I'm not saying don't do it, but maybe talk to a lawyer first.

If gamergaters spent half as much time trying to fix systemic problems that they claim to care about as they do correcting "misconceptions" about gamergate, I *might* start to take them seriously.
   Want to fix games journalism?  Why not start with the large corporations that bribe their way into getting good reviews at large publications that lead to millions of dollars in sales.  Target EA, who just this week went to court to defend against a class-action lawsuit filed by gamers.  While the court found in their favor, they *also* determined that the statements put out by EA were "puffery" and did not reflect reality.  How will this impact the industry going forward?  Does  bother having an opinion on this?
   Targeting female indie developers is complete weaksauce.  And the fact that this comprises the vast majority of  "activism" proves the allegation that it's filled with whiny man-babies.
   You know what I *don't* care about?  People I don't know who supposedly shagged other people I don't know.  No one whose opinion matters cares about this hypothetical scandal.  It's all a pseudo-intellectual circlejerk.
   You either care about journalistic ethics enough to target large corporations and key players, or you're just fucking around.  Seriously.   This is as true for you (yes, you personally) as it is for the   crowd.

First of all, it is never *ever* someone's fault when random internet creeps stalk and harass them.  If continuing to have an opinion and be in an industry is "feeding the trolls" then you should seriously consider changing your views on the subject.
As for the rest, I'd like to quote Meredith Patterson:
"A person was cruelly emotionally abused. That person called out their abuser, and in overwhelming majority, a community which claims as one of its defining characteristics an opposition to gaslighting, siloing and all other forms of abuse rallied around the *perpetrator*.  Why did that    By Newsweek's count, Brianna Wu and Anita Sarkeesian got nearly 80'000 twitter comments in response to their views on GamerGate itself.  Eighty thousand -- that's more than all journalists and news outlets combined (including Kotaku).  Tell me this isn't about the ongoing harassment of women who have an opinion.  I don't watch AS's videos and find her conclusions to be quite thin at times.  Doesn't matter -- she has the fundamental right to voice an opinion.
   My favorite part of this whole gamergate shitstorm was when Marcia Hofmann pointed out inconsistencies and someone immediately said that it was the game devs' faults for having opinions.  They said it non-jokingly and completely without irony.  The underlying message is: "Censor yourself or be prepared to go into hiding."  That's no way to live and I won't support it.
   If you're serious about journalistic ethics, then you should be prepared to send letters and form protest around large companies.  If 0.5% of EA's customers sent emails asking them to change policies or correct errors in their sales materials, their policies would change very quickly.
   Well I mentioned EA's case, and that doesn't seem particularly thrilling to you.  There was the huge fiasco a few years ago around Kane and Lynch, and I would hazard a guess that GameSpot's editorial practices haven't changed.
   And if you don't want to be associated with abject harassment, then don't hitch your wagon to a cause that harasses people.  Form a group of sane people and pick a different hashtag.  I have literally *no* sympathy for sane people who aren't willing to use a different hashtag.  They're sacrificing integrity in order to ride a wave of abjectly shitty [1] [2] [3]

One should also be aware of the implications of giving a child a very common name.  I've known several "Chris Brown"s and an unreasonable number of "John Smith"s.  Though one should be aware also of what German sociologists call 'Kevinismus' [1] -- the recognition that all names come with cultural attachments, and not all of them positive.  I get asked fairly regularly if I'm Welsh (nope) since that's the association people make between heraldry and anglicized last names.
   Being anonymous or easily confused with another person is not all positive.  In fact, I would say that it's mostly a negative.  My name is uncommon, but I went by a nickname for years because it was more interesting.  It also offered some amount of protection in the days before anyone could just buy my LexisNexis profile and know my weird middle name and past lovers' names and how many freckles I have.  Now?  Not so much.  Any name plus one or two additional data points is enough to clearly identify someone in a dataset.
   In my case, the benefits of having a relatively uncommon name outweigh the downsides.  I still have the freedom to do things anonymously or under a pseudonym, and use that freedom on a regular basis.  And if my name were so unique as to cause me problems, changing it is about $250.

Aloha from Baltimore,
   The protests have been peaceful of late, and actually fairly peaceful overall.  The police, however, have not been.  Despite claiming to be basically terrified of black people congregating in large groups, Baltimore cops killed another unarmed man two days ago.  Earlier this week, I got trapped in DC overnight due to the curfew, and last night my boyfriend got trapped at my place despite living a block away.  I've got video of a hundred or so soldiers marching through the streets near the train station as the curfew takes effect (out of hundreds that did so).
   Last night, my kid sister had to come home at 10:10 and it was the first time that I've been worried about her safety since she's lived with me.  Because she's a minor, the curfew means that she's not even legally allowed outside for any reason without me present [0].  Not to go to a friend's house, or to grab a cup of coffee, or to volunteer.  Because I'm her guardian, I of course have given her permission to do all of those things because Fuck That Noise [1].  But we're also about to make our exit because living under helicopter noise with cops driving around in vehicles that have gun turrets on them is not great for the psyche, and no kid should have to live in that environment.

You'd be surprised how many of these people are open about having a TS/SCI +poly clearance.  While the people who wrote the backend for Pinwale might not be open about it on LinkedIn, people who use Pinwale in their jobs might be.  A good (unanswered) question might be just how many people who've worked for Booz Allen Hamilton (as listed on LI) *don't* use classified keywords compared to the number that do.
   People tend to think that LinkedIn is a safe environment to be open about their past work.  Which is obviously bullshit, and I'd posit that it's actually worse than Facebook because your information is shared with the general public.  Even with higher privacy settings enabled, anyone with a paid Recruiter account can see everything.
