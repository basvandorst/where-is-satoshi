suggested scanning the email itself for the PGP identifier might be more
useful and less prone to being fooled by someone who just puts the
header in there without actually encrypting. Also, headers don't have to
be in a specific order, it's possible that "From:" or "Subject:"
accidentally get moved ahead of "X-PGP-Encrypted:" by mistake and that

The thing that really irks me the most about TrueCrypt being withdrawn

available under a free software license. Every other full disk
encryption solution out there is either proprietary, only available for
one operating system, or both.
To me, any true successor to TrueCrypt will be available under GPLv3
(not sure I like the idea of someone forking a BSD/MIT licensed clone
and then not sharing the source, aka the "BSD/MIT Tuck And Run"), and
for at least GNU/Linux and Windows (ideally Mac OS X as well). While I
never really needed something like TrueCrypt while it was maintained,
that doesn't mean I won't in the future, and I know there are others who
need TrueCrypt (including multi-platform support).

This is correct.
It could be any number of things. Some ISPs even sell access packages
with "family-friendly" filtering built in. Spyware or logging of sites
accessed wouldn't be too far of a leap from this.
By their nature, I would expect most garden variety anti-spyware
packages to not consider "parental control" type tools as spyware and
not detect them. They certainly aren't viruses. I think most
anti-spyware tools on Windows require administrator access to run.
There's no easy way to detect screenshots being taken. You would need to
check the local hard disk for copies of the screenshots, and outbound
network traffic for something that could be a screenshot being uploaded.
This is difficult at best without administrator access.
It would be best, but it may not be possible if the computer is secured
correctly. The parent threat model (as a minor child) is a particularly
tough nut to crack. Even if you subvert the technical spying measures,
there could be consequences for doing so. At least where I live in the
US, minors can't own property legally, so parents can spy on a computer
that  "belongs to" their kids.
If your friend's parents feel the need to spy on his/her Internet
access, there are issues beyond the technological ones. There is a basic
lack of trust on the part of the parents, possibly caused by their poor
parenting of your friend when he/she was younger, that needs to be
addressed. In other words, find out why they feel spying is necessary.
In the meantime, your friend may want to do the majority of his/her
Internet access from the local library; it may not be completely
uncensored but there is a much lower chance of being individually spied
on there.

I am all for freedom of speech, but a list started for a specific

off-topic. The tor-talk list (which I do not subscribe to) was started
for a specific purpose, and allowing the continued posting of off-topic

I don't work for the US military or US government, but I support the TOr
Project's and Graham Boyce's efforts to restore order to the list in
principle. Those who have threatened to rejoin the list under other
identities have committed a despicable and reprehensible act and deserve
the ban from the forum they have received. I will admit that sometimes our governments in the US sometimes get it
wrong when passing laws. We as a nation have learned from our mistakes
and the history of the laws reflect this. To infiltrate an e-mail list
originated from private computer systems with off-topic posts, and then
to threaten to continue doing so despite being banned from that list is
against the law in most states and I believe violates Federal law as
well. It is the right of the Tor Project and the people behind it to
refuse to re-publish off-topic messages. To that effect, I support the
Tor Project taking legal action against any such offenders if that
becomes necessary.
Before anyone even asks, my beliefs are the same regardless of whether

Probably because quite a few people consider it neater, and also because
it allows one to make a sparse file of a disk image. Of course the flip
side of this is that if you are using, say, ~100MiB of a ~1TiB
filesystem, the other ~924MiB is going to have zeroes and thus any
forensic analysis can be concentrated on the ~100MiB that doesn't. But,
you're free to dd from /dev/urandom to a new file afterwards if you
really want (this is how BleachBit wipes free space, BTW: writing to a
file which is immediately deleted).

Pretty sure it's a DoD standard you are referring to, and I think the
original spec was a 35 pass wipe based on the differing magnetic storage
patterns of old hard drives (RLL, MFM, etc). While anything particularly
sensitive I would probably wipe a good 3 times (plus a final pass with
zeroes) to be sure, I remember reading or hearing one pass with zeroes
is enough to make it effectively impossible without an electron
microscope on modern drives, and that more than four passes is likely
overkill on modern drives.
All this of course goes out the window if you are using solid state
drives, which if set up properly will actually wipe your free space for
you and severely frustrate any attempts at forensic analysis, and for
which overwriting prior to deletion may actually reduce the lifespan of
your drive for dubious if any gain.
Of course, if you really need to get rid of the info and you don't want
to use the drive again, there's always the shredder.
Anyway, back to the nominal topic: I have looked through BleachBit's
source code and it appears to do a one-pass wipe with zeros, if the
overwrite data option is turned on. This appears to be the only option
offered, at least in my version (1.12).

Exactly. Sure, technically you can write in anybody and vote for anybody

Let me explain to you how presidential voting works (in every state but
Maine and Nebraska, anyway):
1. The candidate with the most votes takes all the electoral votes in
that state.
2. As a result of  a vote for any candidate who finishes below second
place is effectively the same as voting for the eventual winner. Put
another way, it robs the second place candidate of the votes needed to
So... in Texas, Trump won. That means voting for Gary Johnson was the
same as voting for Trump. Voting for Jill Stein was the same as voting
for Trump. Voting for Evan McMullin was the same as voting for Trump.
If everyone in Texas who had voted just for Gary Johnson had voted for
Hillary instead, we'd be having an entirely different discussion because
Trump would not have won.
I will say this: at least Jill Stein or Evan McMullin couldn't have been
any worse than Trump. But the system as it stands now doesn't even give
them, or others who run outside of the two major parties, a realistic
chance to win the presidency. This sucks, but it is what it is.

There is no obligation that they advertise with Breitbart. Or, for that

time I've been alive and is still out there. It's actually pretty good
sunscreen too. I guess you'd boycott them too, as they don't advertise
on Breitbart either?)
Kellogg's wanted to retain their customers. Their customers didn't want
the company supporting Breitbart with advertising. So, they quit
advertising on Breitbart. I don't blame them; their shareholders would
throw a shitfit if they lost customers by continuing to run their ads in
spite of known customer dissatisfaction with what is being paid for by
those ads, and the lost profit that would result from lost customers had

And those four brands are the start of an undoubtedly long list,
combined with many other companies, some of which have yet to be

Profit. The same reason Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Procter & Gamble, and...

news sites do the same thing, but usually there's some justification to
it (i.e. Nestlé and this urge of theirs to bottle up water, especially
in places like Michigan not too far outside of Flint).
Breitbart is calling for the boycott themselves, just because Kellogg's
pulled their ads. They are making it sound like Kellogg's is attacking
the company, even though their PR guy clearly said the move is not

What is your alternative proposal for cleaning up the list and ensuring

If you have a way to rid of all the e-turds being sent to this list
without moderation, I'm all ears. However, at the current rate, in a
couple of months "moderator(s)" wouldn't be an accurate description of
those with the responsibility--it would be more like "zookeeper(s)."

Again, this time with definitions:
moderation â(countable and uncountable, plural moderations)
    The process of moderating a discussion
moderate â(third-person singular simple present moderates, present
participle moderating, simple past and past participle moderated)
    (intransitive) To become less excessive
    (intransitive) To act as a moderator; to assist in bringing to
Contrast this with:
censorship â(countable and uncountable, plural censorships)
    The use of state or group power to control freedom of expression or
press, such as passing laws to prevent media from being published or
One is still free to post one's own thoughts elsewhere when presented
with a moderated forum whose members do not allow them or otherwise
declare them to be off topic. By all means, please start
neonaziandkkkpunks if that's what you want.
But please recognize moderating the list we are on now would still leave
you free to express whatever you want. The rest of us that actually want
to discuss cypherpunk values could do without all this garbage, filth,

I despise censorship (just read the archives of the first blog in my

various large groups of friends. I'm the first one to add PDF versions
of banned books to my BitTorrent client to further any attempt to

than outright censorship, and it is important to learn the huge difference.

First, why the hell are you running an anonymous FTP server in 2016?!
FTP needs to die... it was designed in an era where it was acceptable to
send passwords across the internet in plain text. That era is long gone.
HTTP (really HTTPS now) for downloads, and SFTP/SCP for the use cases
where HTTP(S) won't really fit.
Second, if I remember right, .scr *is* a type of Windows executable
(originally used for screensavers). Thank Microsoft for that one... most
people wouldn't recognize .scr the way they would, say, .exe, .dll, and
the like. This is why I like the Unix method a lot better: if you want
to run something, you either have to feed it to something like bash or
python on the command line, or give it execute permissions. Of course,
the flip side of this is that mounting stuff over SMB has the executable
bit set on everything, even stuff for which an execute action would not
make any sense... which kind of shoots down this rudimentary security
mechanism. (Again, blame Microsoft, who clearly thinks the existence of
an execute permission bit is redundant.)
Not much I haven't said before, though:

And now that I look again, LoC is probably a better system for this

licensed by libraries using it.
Yes, it's weird to group geography, anthropology, and recreation under
one main category, but I'm not sure there's a better place for it under
the other broad categories. It's much the same problem as the
shortcomings of the original Encyclopedia of Chess Openings scheme of
classifying chess openings has started to show its limitations, with a
lot of codes being devoted to openings no longer played and a lot of
lines of common openings being stuck under the exact same code. Thus the
reason for the unofficial "Scid extensions" etc.
If neither LoC nor (a bootleg use of) Dewey fit your needs, there's
always the option of rolling your own.

So strictly speaking, I was a bit off the mark. However, I think neither
the OTF nor the NSF are able to exert the kind of pressure that was asserting to be the reason that there is no chaff-filled network
feature in Tor.
And it still means  was probably wrong on this statement:
but of course the conspiracy theorists and the people like  who
insist I work for the US government (a huge laugh given my past, BTW)
are going to say that NSF money and CIA/DIA/DOD/NSA money are the same,
yada yada yada, bullshit bullshit bullshit (to the tune of The Battle

Right. In other words, it's not laundered NSA money to put a subtle
backdoor in despite what  is going to try to tell us. Glad we're
clear on that.
This is the one that worries me a bit. Now I'd rather the State
Department not fund Tor, but the timing of the drop-off says a lot.

I saw something mentioned about 1.3 million IP addresses involved. Well,
as I replied to a posting of this story on Facebook, they can have 1.3
million copies of my middle finger. It's so obvious to me this is
partisan crap from DJT. Say what you will about Hillary, she would have
handled this with far more grace and wouldn't be resorting to such
tactics to silence her critics.
I hope we get Bernie in 2020. To be fair though, we can't possibly elect
anyone much worse than DJT, so voting Democrat will almost certainly be
an improvement over the status quo (assuming we still have DJT then,
hopefully at least DJT will be impeached and Pence will be in).

Honestly, I think we're overdue for SCOTUS to make some new rulings on
the First Amendment, though I am not sure I want the current SCOTUS to
be the one making those rulings. (We all know Merrick Garland should be
on the bench in place of Gorsuch, or at least should have gotten a
proper "nay" vote.)
How much of what is or was on The Daily Stormer could be qualified in
some form as "fighting words" (i.e. in the words of Justice Frank Murphy
"those [words] which by their very utterances inflict injury or tend to
incite an immediate breach of the peace")? How much of what has been

I'm not Jewish and nowhere near black, yet I find what happened in
Charlottesville horrifying. This is 2017, not 1957 or 1877.

Because Tor requires a properly set clock, especially for hidden
services. HTTPS also requires a properly set clock to validate certificates.
If you start Tails and tell it not to connect to the network at all, I
don't think it tries to set the clock. Almost everything Tails does with
networking goes over Tor, so if Tor is broken on Tails, networking is
broken. (If it sets the clock over NTP, that doesn't, but it's no more
incriminating than anyone else's use of NTP.)
Okay, why does everything use HTTP/HTTPS if it possibly can?
Because there are so many birdbrained administrators that block just
about every other protocol. You'd think they think the Internet is only
ports 80 and 443.
Not that long ago, I was on a hospital's public wifi and I could not
even connect to my PC back home on SSH port 22, much less over OpenVPN
or even Iodine (IP tunneling over DNS requests). Now, OpenVPN and SSH
work from the Starbucks locations around me... for now. In the future I
may have to tunnel those over HTTPS as well. I shouldn't have to; you're
right. But blame the birdbrained network admins that block everything else.

I'm not a fascist. I do think the length of copyright restrictions have
gotten out of hand (thanks to Disney for lobbying to extend copyright
every damned time the original Mickey Mouse is about to enter public
domain). From Wikipedia:
However, I don't have a problem the general concept of copyright; my
problems are with the obscenely long terms that Hollywood has bought and
paid for, that have effectively killed the public domain.
Copyright pre-dates WWII and Nazi Germany by centuries, and the US by at
least decades, originating in 1709 with the Statute of Anne in England.
It is not, by any means, an American invention. Given that it predates
Hitler by centuries, calling it a "Nazi" law is at best unintentionally
misleading, and at worst outright wrong.

Personally, I would rather read flagrant personal attacks and outright
pornography from Cecilia than even one-tenth of the flagrant racist
(including white supremacist), anti-semitic, homophobic, and dishonest
spam that eminates from the like of those who I now call  and %& Her posts are probably more on-topic than that sort of filth
and fraudulent garbage. (Arguably the worst example of said filth and
fraudulent garbage is changing the name of Lauren Weinstein's PFIR or
People for Internet Responsibility to a misleading, fraudulent, and
racist name, such that it makes it more difficult to fact-check the
original postings.)
Unmoderated lists like these work best only when the participants agree
on a topic and to behave as decent people. While I understand the
objections to moderating this list (note: NOT censoring, moderating),
there's almost no point to having the list if it's not going to stay on
a defined topic and if we as a community have no power to deal with
those who habitually behave as anthropomorphic uncaged animals.
If the "cypherpunks" banner is to mean anything, then we need to take it
back from those who are using it as an excuse to be racists, homophobes,
thieves, and liars. As someone who is today a citizen of good character,
I feel I should be able to call myself a cypherpunk and maintain my
membership here without risk of associating myself with those who engage
in such putrid and/or criminal conduct as I have enumerated above. I
believe a true cypherpunk is of good character (including honesty and a
respect for basic standards of decency) and disown those who use the
"cypherpunks" banner and mailing list to partake of and further conduct
to the contrary.
I'm no fan of personal attacks, and I can see how overt sexual content
would be at least nominally off-topic, but those two things rank among
the very least of our problems.

delete BÃ³rrese The character is irrelevant. The article seems to seek to
promote it. None of the sources is reliable, or are blogs or promotional
pages or are not independent sources of the biography, for example,
links to YouTube videos created by him or related people to promote
their ideas. References to the Indymedia forum, Webzine blog or social
networks have no value for Wikipedia. The only sources that could be
independent lead us to links that do not exist or can not be accessed
(for example, I wanted to enter the link to Infobae, which is a known
medium and which is accessed without payment and I am told that can
access because they ask me to pay and "it is possible that the attackers
are trying to steal your information (for example, passwords, messages
or credit cards)" which I suspect are links to malicious sites. I did
not even name the biographer, that is, they are misleading, other
sources refer to unreliable sites, such as this Kontrainfo reference
(and since we are, we should add Wikipedia to that list of sinister
sites "supported by the Open Society Foundation" and that it is a great
donor of those who sustain our work.) This source is reliable but the
only thing about it is that it appears on the list of signatories, this
reference could be used to an article about the group "Libertad &
Equidad" but not for his biography since he does not tell us anything
about its relevance. I want to say that anyone can sign something. I
also tried to enter the references that put to HispanTV but it appeared
to me that Â«It was not possible to find the IP address of the serverÂ».
In short, many references but most misleading, not found, unreliable or
not named. Unknown character in my country that probably seeks to
promote. Career without encyclopedic relevance. Does not comply with the
established in Wikipedia: Encyclopedic relevance. --Jalu (discussion)

        Care Attention! I do not want to fall into sensationalism, but
why the remark that the Open Society Foundation is a "great donor" of
Wikipedia? I think it has no relevance in this debate if the article in
question speaks well or badly of Open Society, nor should it be
understood that it is better not to speak badly of said foundation just
because it provides donations to the page. It's the only thing that
stands out from your comment, the rest seems to me to be in line with

    Comment Comment for the librarian who is going to close the query.
LefontQ (disc. Â· Contr.) Is a CPP created to exclusively edit articles
related to NicolÃ¡s MorÃ¡s. From 2016 until the start date of this
consultation. He had bleached his diff discussion so he would not see
the different ads he received for promotional since he created the
article. All his interventions in the TAB were to defend this article,
and avoid its deletion, for example diff. Godivaciones (disc. Â· Contr.),
On the other hand, is an account created after starting this query, CPP
whose sole purpose seems to be that this article is not deleted. He has
dedicated himself to proselytizing, de-legitimizing this consultation,
inviting him to support:

    Chamarasca
    Vitor
    Waka Waka
    Marcomogollon
    Arkangel414
    Verent
    Muago

    Sowairan
It is very striking that, in all these invitations, he has forgotten to
tell Hades7 (disc. Â· Contr.), Who had been opining about the lack of
relevance of this biography, diff and who is the one who placed the
template without relevance , diff. --Jalu (discussion) 17:43 6 Jun 2019

    Keep yourself Stay really I do not see that the article has any
self-promotion dyes, at any time I appreciate it. Regarding relevance,
which is apparently the main problem here, I see that most of the
sources used belong to media without any affiliation with the subject.
When searching the web I find a lot of information about MorÃ¡s, so I
assume that media notoriety has. Likewise, its association with media
such as Hispan TV and Telesur confirm my idea of ââits relevance.
Therefore, I think that the article should be maintained, also
appreciating the improvements that have been made in recent
days.Darthvader2 (discussion) 05:03 11 Jun 2019 (UTC)
    Keep yourself Stay - As other users said, I do not see
self-promotion in the article (although certain paragraphs should be
rewritten). There are sources and references in different parts of the
article and I do not think that it seeks to generate controversy; in
fact, it has a section where the "controversies" are mentioned.
I do not see the difference between this article and that of, for
example, Baby Etchecopar or Javier Milei, who also have controversies.
Now, if we go with respect to relevance, I do not see why they consider
that it does not have; the fact of being a journalist from the Argentine
south does not make it less important than those of the Federal Capital.
In fact, if we follow the line of relevance, in Wikipedia there are
articles by less relevant people such as Charlotte Caniggia
 or Barbara VÃ©lez
 B% C3% A1rbara_V% C3% A9lez that are not
just very relevant people, but "children of" other celebrities.
In short, none of the arguments that are used to delete the article
seems valid: 1. the article does not seem self-promoting because it also
talks about disputes. 2. I do not think it is very relevant, since
Wikipedia has articles from less relevant people (like the ones I
mentioned above), added to the fact that I believe that the person is
discredited a little because it is not Capital. 3. I DO NOT see that it
breaks rules, since it contains sources and references. For all this, I
vow to keep the article. DMAC89 (discussion) 18:08 June 11 2019 (UTC)

you entered directly to this opinion to give your opinion? You do not
even know how to make an internal link to Charlotte Caniggia or Baby
Etchecopar or Javier Milei. Also, what do the articles by Baby
Etchecopar or Javier Milei have to do with it? How is the person being
discredited because he or she is not a Capital? Who said that being a
journalist from the Argentine south is less important than the ones from
the Federal Capital? and, fundamentally, how do you know that it is from
the south if the article does not say it? --Jalu (discussion) 18:23 11

    I was observing the debate about maintaining or not maintaining this
article, although some find errors in the links area for example, I will
also deny link 10 because it is found to be in a private browsing.
Perform a research on NicolÃ¡s MorÃ¡s and showed results of interviews
conducted on his personal opinion on the political situation of the
country, and publication in independent newspapers and regional scope.
Also watch a total of 37 videos of him offering interviews and debates
on television and universities. Being an audiovisual source, it bases
the validity of this article.
    Some users have commented on the topic of what is a more
self-referential article perhaps it would be good if the article is
re-edited and detected those links that will really have to be deleted
because they do not have direct access.
    He is an independent journalist who is venturing into activities of
his profession, every young journalist begins working with independent
journalism and is something that should not be underestimated. That is
why I share with DMAC89 his perspective of point two where he explains
that anyone has an article in a wikipedia and that these characters are
not very relevant. I observed that it is part of the "Civic Freedom and
Equity Movement" this is proven in the work with respectable characters
in the area of ââculture and thinkers. - The previous unsigned comment

Keep greetings, I do not intend to argue, but I want to reason my vote:
I find it reasonable that the publication of the article may lead to the
conclusion that it is self-promotional because of the way it was
initially published and the way in which some users have intervened.
However on the other hand the way in which it is judged so that it is
discarded, so fervently in some cases, could also lead to think that
there is this type of motivations but in the other sense. Even more
after seeing the surprising argumentation in relation to the OSF of Mr.
Soros that although it was noticed as irrelevant by another user
immediately, but I think it has enough relevance that without any blush
it is said that the donations of the OSF have some impact in the
publication, discarding or deletion of an article in the Wikipedia
according to the interests of this foundation according to the donations
made to Wikipedia "because it is a great donor of those who support our
work." Let's put the case upside down. Let's say that Mr. MorÃ¡s makes a
significant contribution to the Wikipedia cause. Would this be a
determining factor to be considered relevant and articles related to it
would be relevant? Skinny favor to our "free" encyclopedia. This calls
me a lot of attention, because those who argued that the article was
rejected rejected not only refute (which I applaud) but they went
directly to suspect (which I do not applaud) the opinion of the other
participants because of its recent incorporation or lack of activity,
when it was enough to counteract them (as some have done) and when
Wikipedia has as a principle the presumption of good faith and it would
not be desirable for some editor or librarian to begin to point out the
detractors of this page due to suspicions of act pro NGO, without some
evidence. So we find an ad hominem argument that can come back as a
boomerang on anyone. In this query the vehemence of the accusations,
some argument lazy, etc. Everything can be used as a pretext to erase or
incorporate the article, if we start pointing at each other. Undoubtedly
throughout Latin America there are less relevant characters and
situations that have overcome deletion queries or that have not even
gone through this filter. And the only doubt that this article sends to
consultation, tells me that it was not subject to quick deletion for
something. In my opinion Mr. MorÃ¡s has some relevance, not the greatest,
nor the best, but some notoriety has reached with his journalistic work
revealing financing schemes to politicians of various tendencies,
reading about this was that I found about him. I invite you to leave
arguments ad hominem aside and polish Wikipedia, including this article.

About the sources, I agree that they are quite, however, mostly medium
and large media and the links I reviewed work well. I think MorÃ¡s's
journalistic activity is a relevant article in Wikipedia terms and
therefore it should be kept on the platform. This without rejecting the

    stay Stay Stay I can not comment on the relevance of an article
referring to a political activist. We can not ignore that questioning
the relevance of these social actors is not innocent. It is a dialelo
that we should write "relevant" articles based only on what the mass
media reports. The shortage of articles and that these are neutral are
anathema to this free encyclopedia. Our task is to offer users
information about people that even in our opinion may seem irrelevant.
We all know that correcting political articles is a difficult, sensitive
task in which the quality of information is especially tested. This
information may be relevant for some users who are in favor or even
against this alleged character. If the alleged character is irrelevant,
no one will enter this article or anyone will read it. For this reason I
am opposed to deletion. In my opinion, article should be totally
restructured and summarized. The format should not suggest political
propaganda as it is currently. The article should provide sufficient and
neutral information to understand who this activist is and what he
thinks. HANNAN Orange color.jpg23: 47 12 Jun 2019 (UTC)

Comment Comment I have my doubts. On the one hand, the character, in
itself, seems relevant to me (even if he is a controversialist rather
than an intellectual); However, I am worried about this wave of users
who came to defend this article, because more than a spontaneous
reaction, it seems to be a recruitment other than Wikipedia. I do not
have much evidence, but in places like Workana and Freelancer (I see
that it was mentioned before) they have been calling people to answer in
erasure queries. Therefore, I am inclined to think that the article is
self-promotional. --Luis Alvaz (discussion) 23:55 Jun 12 2019 (UTC)
     The previous discussion is kept as a record of the debate. Please,
do not modify it. This page should not be edited anymore.
What I gather from this discussion (given the half-assed and partially
mangled English typical of automatic translation in the late 2010s), is
that the article appears to have been deleted because it appeared to be
more self-promotional than encyclopedic. I don't think feminism or other
political ideology entered into it (what Jalu appears to be saying in
what was translated as "the character is irrelevant"). That someone
would assume radical feminism is behind such a decision is something I
find rather sad.
As nominally off-topic as this may be, I wouldn't mind discussing this
further here. However, I would ask that in this thread, we have no
personal attacks and use neutral terms to refer to the parties involved,
in particular avoiding the use of slurs such as one perpetuated by a
certain conservative US talk show host. Let's keep the debate in this
thread rubbish-free and focus on the facts and the issues, not personal

Not really. The cryptography list is more of a technical list and

with such things as the race and nationality of certain government
officials somehow being qualified as related to that topic... or maybe not.
I wouldn't even call the cypherpunks list an example of what

And before anyone even asks me these questions: No, Tor is not perfect;
it certainly beats nothing, but shouldn't be considered a complete

No, the laws in the US, as they exist now are not perfect, far from it

prohibition). Yes, governments have committed some first-class fuckups,

As far as "destroy[ing] the usability of a list and clog[ging] its
servers with [off-topic or irrelevant posts]", that's orthogonal to
whether or not subscribers can post though it does raise the bar ever so
slightly. I'm still trying to figure out why generic posts about
politics, particularly those that highlight race, religion/national
origin, or beliefs of certain people more so than the actual issue, have
to do with the nominal topic of what I'd expect a cypherpunks list to be.

It is important to know how to do basic math using only pencil and
paper, but beyond addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and
square roots (which can be done on paper, just nobody teaches them
anymore), a lot of the calculations start to get really tedious when you
have to work out each step by hand (trigonometry functions, logarithms,
etc) and the chances for errors go way up.
Yes, if you need a calculator to do 2+2, you deserve to fail math. But
that's not why calculators are allowed on modern math tests.

If you can spare the extra overhead to run a crypto filesystem, yes, do
that. (On systems as old as my current laptop, it's barely a workable
option, and I did notice better performance when I went back to an
unencrypted filesystem. Then again, my threat model was strictly
protecting against my laptop getting stolen when out and about, less of
a concern now especially with the COVID-19 pandemic limiting the need to
take it out of the hose.) However it still can't hurt to wipe deleted
files and free space as a matter of routine privacy protection.
However, do be aware of things like encrypted filesystems complicating
data recovery in the event of software/hardware failure. Sure, maybe the
cops can't get your data, but it can bite you in the ass when Shit
Happens(tm) and as a result *you* can't get your data either.

Okay, that's a horse of an entirely different color. That could very

be able to diagnose it further, though the fact that Telegram lets you
delete messages and have them disappear *from the history of the account
you sent them to* should be noted (and that this is actually intended as
a feature, though I consider it much closer to a bug).

Per the Telegram FAQ:
Q: How does account self-destruction work?
Telegram is not a commercial organization, and we value our disk space
greatly. If you stop using Telegram and don't come online for at least
six months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media,
contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.
You can change the exact period after which your inactive account will
self-destruct in Settings.
This is one reason I don't usually use Telegram except when there's no
other choice, that and it's difficult to keep a permanent record of what
was said (designed in on purpose).

Bleachbit, shred (from GNU coreutils), and zerofree (if you have a way
to easily remount as read-only before and remount read-write after) are
your friends. On a mechanical drive, overwriting once with zeroes beats
not overwriting at all, though I would definitely do more than that if
there's data you really can't risk falling into the wrong hands. On an
SSD, TRIM early and TRIM often, and the drive takes care of this for you
(even on Windows, which will helpfully TRIM for you up to once per day).

I'm still scratching my head wondering what  flagrant racism,
antisemitism, etc have to do with the cypherpunk movement and/or
securing technology through encryption. Just kidding... they don't,  but
apparently since a certain other list is moderated (or if you'd believe
some people, "censored"), all that stuff just gets posted here. I've
even seen this list cc'd or even threads outright redirected here when
it wouldn't pass muster on the other list. Yes, that list is a
"technical" list, and I'm not saying this list should become a carbon
copy of it, but this is what I'm talking about regarding topic drift.
I support the original mission of the cypherpunks movement. As stated in
the Wikipedia article:
There are times and places where one must protect themselves from
security risks wearing blue and carrying badges and guns as much as the
ones wearing black and balaclavas, or whatever disguise garb criminals
wear these days. In a perfect world the cops could be trusted to obey
the same laws they are supposed to be enforcing and living up to the
standard of "'s finest" as they are often called. We,
unfortunately, do not live in anything close to a perfect world.
The way it's looking though, regularly slinging antisemitic, racist, and
other slurs, and sticking up for the right to spew outright bullshit
where it's not wanted, appear to be someone's idea of de facto
qualifications to be a "true cypherpunk". I refuse to do either; I see
the ideal form of the cypherpunk movement as egalitarian, where those of
all ethnicities and backgrounds are treated equally and given the same
chance to participate in beneficial social and political change. Yes,
this specifically includes Jews and people of color, as well as LGBTQ+
populations and other marginalized groups.
Honestly, if you're going to shut out some people, or use exclusionary
language such as well-recognized slurs that are avoided by people who
use the word "fuck" like they would use salt and pepper on bland food,
then you're no better than the authorities you pretend to hate. United
we stand, divided we fall.

Some of us out here are stuck on older systems with a maximum of 8GiB of
RAM. Others may be using systems like the Raspberry Pi that can't be
upgraded (that I am aware) and that typically max out at 4GiB or 8GiB.
Sure, it will be a bit faster having 16GiB of RAM and no swap than 8GiB
RAM + 8GiB swap if that is an option. However, modern operating systems
are designed to swap out out certain things to make the best use of all
available RAM and so you will technically not get the full benefit of a
RAM upgrade going this route. It may be, however, that your usage
patterns only max out 16GiB of virtual memory usage either way, in which
case it may not matter as much.

taken out and replaced with neutral terms.
Granted, I'm not sure I'd trust Google with something like this (I
actually disable Google Chrome on my Android phones and use Firefox
instead), but at least I can say this without needless anti-Semitic
slurs and incorrect implications of connections with a political party
from WWII-era Germany.

The link via banned.video works if you access it via infowars.com, and
of course there's always setting sail for The Pirate Bay (*cough*

enough people seed a given torrent. I've tried to seed it, but no takers
so far. It's just under a gigabyte, admittedly not that much space in an
era in which 32GB thumb drives can be had for under US$5 if you know
where to look, so something I'll keep around for a while in case anyone
wants it, and to laugh at in 10 years when it's patently obvious it's
the load of bovine excrement it's been made out to be.
