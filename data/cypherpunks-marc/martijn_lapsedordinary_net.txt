Ouch. I stand corrected. I had missed that bit - I had only skimmed
through the paper last week - and it does explicitly say that the Tor
Project website should be blocked. It even suggests "disciplinary
action" should be taken if people try to access the site. Wow.

Isn't the fact that mobile phones exist - and thus employees don't
depend on their employer's Internet connection during working hours - a
reason why companies blocking Tor isn't too big a deal?
I know companies that have a separate WiFi network in the building, not
connected to the corporate network, that employees can use to get a good
connection on their mobile devices (or personal laptops). They could use
Tor or VPNs too.
A company that blocks Tor because it's worried its employees are up to
no good should change the way it views its employees. A company overly
worried about employees using Tor to exfiltrate sensitive data should
consider blocking the whole of the Internet, or - more realisticly -
store sensitive data in a way that access is restricted to those that
really need it.
But a company that blocks Tor because, as IBM puts it, a lot of
malicious actors use Tor is making a sensible security decision.
