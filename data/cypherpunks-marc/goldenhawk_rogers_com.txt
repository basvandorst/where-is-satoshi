I don't see what you're all so paranoid about.  I doubt there's a law against obtaining this source and learning its secrets.
Distributing it may be in violation of copyrights, but it'd be chilling if everyone who viewed an illegal copy was somehow an acomplice to copyright That said I've seen paranoia above and beyond on this mailing list!  Reading someone else's source doesn't automatically taint yours.  It's called 'copy'right because you actually have to copy it to be in violation.  Now if you were to say, "Well it may not be illegal, but Microsoft will trump it up and try to squash us with litegation!"  News flash, they have so many lawyers they can trump up anything on anyone any time.  We're all already under the sword of damecles we might as well wiggle a little.
Although on the other hand it would be natural good sense not to give the enemy ammunition by admitting that you actually looked at the source.  I suggest that each and every ReactOS developer quietly examine the Windows source, discover all its secrets (documenting the secrets thouroughly without referencing the source), and then delete all the source with 'shred'.
