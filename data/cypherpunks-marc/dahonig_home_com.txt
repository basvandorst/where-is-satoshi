Excellent ideas but: You have to make sure that both sender and receiver have the
same opsec motivations and unseverable responsibilities ---else legitimate sender or receiver could screenshot the plaintext to "cover their asses" when the "bit hits the fan".  Similarly with
externally-secure multimedia exchanges.  Employees of consultant
accounting firms tend to turncoat when things get warm.
The Paperless Office has succeeded ever so well :-), so one also needs to deploy much better shredders --so you don't have to worry about low-level insiders taking a box of documents home to
pack their things with (see Enron).  [Fire works well and you can

Here you're talking about "reputation of nyms", which doesn't require
third parties or certs, just well-kept secret keys of a PK pair.  If the remote entity keeps using the same PK keys, you can reasonably
update reputation
based on that alone.   (They're essentially signing their behaviors.)
[Moderator's note: I fully agree. I was disputing only the notion that
unauthenticated connections were sufficient. Authentication does not
require certificates or third parties -- see the way SSH handles keys
for example. --Perry]
Since a signed cert is useful for recovering ZERO dollars from the signer,
if you've been defrauded by some entity, the end result is the same if a MIM defrauds you.  A *trusted* signer would solve the confidentiality loss problem but not the
liability problem.  But given that signers will sign *anything* (and why
not, they have no
financial liability and little useful reputation to lose) this is a small

No, its more.  SSL sans certs is like using envelopes to write to
Dear Abby.  You have no authentication on who Dear Abby "really is" but your communications are private.
Since the entity who claims to be Dear Abby also gives
a communications address, writing to Dear Abby at that address is sufficient. (Modulo MIM attacks)
[Moderator's note: Except that's precisely the point: "Modulo MIM
attacks" is like saying "we're all immortal, modulo death". The
question isn't some sort of mystification of identity -- it is being
able to know that you're talking to the same "Dear Abby" your friends
have talked to and that you talked to last week. Now that MIM attacks
have been automated they don't even need sophistication to conduct. --Perry]
When you call a phone number listed with an advert, and give them your credit card number, you have less
confidentiality (you're speaking plaintext), but its the same model.

More demos: You can create your own cert with TinySSL, a lightweight ( <

the info there.  Using trademarks (RSA, Verisign, etc.) in the fields
would escape most.  Or, as the TinySSL docs advise, you can get a free
cert from Thawte --which *in fact* certifies only that you can receive
email at the address you gave them.
As others have written, great for enabling SSL's confidentiality, nothing

Recommended: The Dream Machine: JCR Licklider and the Revolution That

Pg 276 describes the origin of the "internet was designed for nuke
robustness" 'myth' though the 'myth' itself is not mentioned.  The story is not completely baseless but its more complex.
Ca. 1965 three groups discovered they were all
working on packet switching independently.  One of them was Paul Baran of RAND
who was interested in them as nuke-survivable, though according to a
footnote, more for deterrance than actual use.  One of the two other
groups was run by the British Postal Service which rejected it, and
Barans idea not adopted by various parties for various reasons, and Larry Roberts' (of ARPA) group became the net.
The book goes from Bush, Weiner, Shannon, Turing to Berners-Lee
and assumes the reader got net.

(Since the original spheres' volume depends on drill radius and height, but the volume of the ring depends only on height)
Generally in a 'word problem/riddle' you suspect 1. a clever solution not
variables you might think you need (the case here) 2. a 'trick' question that has no solution (with my misremembered question,
what I thought I had, when I checked the question later and found no drill
size).  Additionally one is suspect of extraneous distracting variables.

And who have driven selection for social skepticism in the rest.
You don't even need a 'subspecies' or even a genetic basis for
psychopathy (though there may some).  Given that cheating is possible,
even accidentally discoverable, any heritable trait which
helps *others* detect cheating will be selected for.  Those traits may
be as general as better memories or as specific as anything you could
hardwire for that specific task.
Run an evolution sim with a 'game theory' component and you'll convince
A recent article in _Science_ traced the ancestry of human dopamine receptors
and claimed that it radiated 40,000 years ago.  There was an implication
that traits that show up as e.g., (maladaptive) ADD in a classroom were
adaptive once.  (DA is involved in many aspects of function including
ADD, schizophrenia, etc; there are over a dozen different receptors for it).
Its quite possible that having two copies of something which gives a benefit
if you have one copy, is too much.  And that different environments develop
evaluate traits differently.  Long fur is good in the arctic, not in the

Someone (Eric *) posted recently that there are problems

PGP plugins interoperate *fine* with Eudora (e.g., 3.05)
and require very few extra mouseclicks, even with folks
still using 2.6.2.  In addition,
the GUI is intuitive.  *Kudos*  If there are interop problems
with GPG I have to blame them on GPG.  I work with
legacy and other keys transparently with PGP plugins under

@_subject: solution to Tim's riddle 
Given a sphere of radius R which has been drilled down its center.
Center the sphere at the origin.  The drilled-out ring is height h.
What is the volume of the ringlike remainder? Since this reeks of an undergrad calc problem, we take that approach.
Answer: Vsphere - Vcylinder - 2 * Vendcap          (1) Vsphere = 4/3 pi R^3
Vcylinder = 2 h pi r^2
For Vendcap, we do basic integration.  We sum the disks making up the endcap.
Vendcap = Integral from h (at the bottom of the endcap) to R (at the top) of ie	          R
                h
Now, this yields pi * ( y R^2  -  y^3/3 ) and we evaluate this at y=R and y=h and take their difference.
This yields pi * ( R^3 - R^3/3 - h R^2 + h^3/3 ) .
Now, remembering to subtract twice this value when plugging into (1),
we find that all terms except 4/3 pi h^3 fall out.  Ie, the volume
depends only on the height; and we note that the dependancy is exactly
that of a sphere's volume on its radius.  (Cymbal flourish)
(Thus the surprise typical of a good pedantic calc problem if you get the
right answer.)
