It is possible to build a simple PGP client with the source you have --
the file pgptest.c offers that, but it's really only for debugging
purposes. Run "make mpgp" in the Src directory to try it.
A better interface to the standalone PGP functions shouldn't be hard to
write. We can look into that if there is demand for it. Note that
Mixmaster has no concept of the web of trust, and doesn't do keychain
management. It assumes that if you are placing a key on your keyring,
you've determined it is valid.
That said, Mixmaster does offer all the basic OpenPGP messaging
capabilities, except for verification of clear-signed messages. (This
wasn't needed for any of the features Mixmaster provides, so it wasn't
added.) We'll be adding this capability soon, however. (The author of
the QuickSilver Windows remailer client app has requested it. QuickSilver
provides PGP capabilities through the Mixmaster .dll, sans clearsig
Mixmaster does support RSA v4 keys, though it doesn't have Twofish support
since it links against OpenSSL for its crypto, and OpenSSL doesn't have
Twofish support. If you have OpenSSL 0.9.7, Mixmaster will support AES.
(Also, Mixmaster now supports use of the Modification Code Detection
packet in OpenPGP messages, which is used to prevent the attack Schneier,
et al. recently wrote about.)
As far as DOS goes -- I honestly haven't tried compiling for DOS. It
"should" work. Please let me know if you run into any problems.
(And, as always, we're in need of developers and testers. If you're
interested in working on this project, please join the development mailing
list. See mixmaster.sf.net for more info.)

A number of cypherpunks have asked me about the current JAP situation.
Here's the scoop, as I know it. (I've sent mail to some of the Dresden
folks, but haven't heard back yet.)
This thread on Usenet contains the pertinent information:
The Java Anonymous Proxy is a real-time web mix system, (originally)
designed to provide web browsing anonymity that couldn't be undermined by
any one proxy operator. Well, no more. The JAP authors silently introduced
a back-channel intended to compromise anonymity of users accessing certain
sites, under the guise of an "obligatory update".
They claim 30,000 total users. That's a large amount of people who are
being lied to about their anonymity. (The JAP website, as of this morning,
was still stating:
"Since many users use these intermediaries at the same time, the internet
connection of any one single user is hidden among the connections of all
the other users.  No one, not anyone from outside, not any of the other
users, not even the provider of the intermediary service can determine
which connection belongs to which user."
Which would be true if not for the backchannel.)
JAP's webpage: The JAP operators justify their actions (which were taken to comply with
German law) by stating that their alternative was to shut the system down.
There are a number of problems with this, the first being that anonymity
systems which are contingent upon selective government approval for
anonymity are ill-suited to a global Internet environment: What makes a
court order from Germany, or England, or the US any more valid than a
court order from another net-connected UN member, like China, or France?
If we believe privacy and anonymity to be human rights, then we cannot
build these sort of backdoors into the system and expect them not to be
Compare the JAP operator's actions with those of Julf Helsingius, operator
of anon.penet.fi (the famous anonymous remailer/pseudonym server):
Julf closed down his system, which was inherently vulnerable to subpoena
attacks since it stored nym to user mapping information, when he realized
he could be forced to reveal any user's identity by almost any entity
willing to abuse the global legal systems.
Time has shown that was the right choice. Cypherpunk and Mixmaster
remailers, already developed and deployed by this time, rose up in penet's
place, and at this point it would be impossible for anyone to effectively
compromise a user's identity via court order. (There are Mixmaster nodes
operating in almost a dozen countries, and the system is truly designed to
defeat rogue operators.) With the next-generation of remailers on the
horizon (Mixminion and Mixmaster 4.0), ease of use should near that of
Penet. Unfortunately, these are email solutions, and don't address the web
browsing issue that JAP attempted to solve.
Bad anonymity systems are worse than no anonymity systems. JAP has become
a bad anonymity system -- mainly because it represents itself as being far
stronger and more secure than it is.
I am unclear on the JAP source code license. Perhaps it is possible to
restore the code to the uncompromised version, and erect a parallel,
trusted JAP network -- though the damage to its reputation is certainly
severe. This goes to demonstrate again that crypto isn't the only
consideration in an anonymity system: Anonymizer, for instance, is still a
better choice for web anonymity than JAP, even though JAP offered mixing
and independent operators. An anonymity provider should never represent
itself as offering a greater level of protection than is actually offered

For what it is worth, there has been a lot of good theory research in the
field of strong anonymity to come out of Dresden.
Operators of anonymity services, of course, are free to do what they wish
with their services: log, not log, restrict users, etc., as long as their
policies are clearly presented to their users. To lie to their users and
to misrepresent the level of anonymity provided by the system is
It's this point of Tim's I have been meaning to address, since it isn't
quite as simple as this.
First of all, JAP was presented as something other than the above. It was
not a "trust us" system -- it used mixes, with independent operators. JAP
was intended to be a "trust the laws of mathematics" system, and was
undermined by the software authors.
I won't go into a lot of detail about why low-latency mixes are more
likely to be breakable, even when deployed correctly, as this is covered
pretty well in the literature. But I would like to suggest that, in some
cases, a "trust us not to narc you out" system may, in fact, be superior
to the alternatives.
The Cypherpunk adage "trust in the laws of mathematics, not of men"
excludes a third evaluation classification: the laws of reputation and
Let's look at JAP vs. Anonymizer, prior to the JAP backdoor issue:
o JAP was a low-latency mix cascade system with independent operators.
o JAP had ~ 30K users.
o JAP was run primarily by educational/research institutions with
  government influence.
o Anonymizer is a low-latency single-hop proxy system with one operator.
o Anonymizer has ~ 100K paid users, and an undetermined amount of free
  users. (Estimates are as high as 2 mil, though that may be a stretch).
o Anonymizer is a for-profit company that makes its money by not narc'ing
  out its users.
From the laws of math vs. men standpoint, JAP looks like it was the better
However, even when setting aside the issue that our understanding of the
math involved may be flawed, JAP quickly becomes less appealing choice
once the other factors are considered.
University / government funded research relies on grants for its
existence. This makes the operators beholden to the source of grant funds.
It also eliminates an economic incentive to put users first.
Private companies offering privacy/anonymity services are faced with a
direct correlation between revenue and delivery of such services. Should a
company like Anonymizer violate its stated privacy policy and misrepresent
its level of security, as JAP did, the results would be devastating to the
viability of the company. The JAP group, on the other hand, is facing
nothing more than a little bad PR and the loss of some users. (Many of
those 30,000 probably are unaware of the silent compromise of JAP
Then there is the anonymity-set issue. With almost 4 times the number of
users as JAP, Anonymizer is much stronger against many adversaries who
lack sophisticated attack capabilities.
Anonymity is difficult to achieve. If the number of users of a system is
too small to provide sufficient cover traffic for the individual users, it
does not matter how "secure" the system is -- it can be treated as a black
box, and its users' actions analyzed.
Honestly, as much as it pains me to say this as maintainer of Mixmaster,
one is probably a lot safer using Anonymizer and Hotmail to send anonymous
email than Mixmaster (against most realistic adversaries at this point)
simply based on the respective size of the user bases. Hopefully that will
improve greatly as the Mixmaster network continues to mature, and remailer
software gets easier to use.
[Yes, as a "trust-us" system, Anonymizer isn't appropriate for some uses
that a correctly implemented and deployed verifiably strong anonymity
system would be. However, those uses aren't likely to be common. But one
must evaluate his own threat models and take whatever precautions are

Also it's important to note that Type II does not support reply blocks,
while "Type I" remailers do. (Perhaps the first cut of Cypherpunk
remailers, i.e. those running Hal's scripts did not, but the Cypherpunk
nym servers that use reply blocks are built on top of Type I.)
For most TLS adversaries that may be correct. However, there are a number
of subtle attacks on Chaum systems that Type I is susceptible to --
tagging and timing attacks in particular, as well as replay attacks, and
various other attacks which all strive to narrow the anonymity set.
Ideally. There are ways to flip bits in PGP encrypted messages which will
not result in a failed decryption, however. (The property you describe is
essential for protecting against tagging attacks. Type II does better than
PGP-based systems, but is still not as good at this as Type III. The
Mixminion design paper covers these concerns in detail:
Right. The claim that "there only needs to be one trustworthy remailer in
a chain" fails to recognize the power of statistical analysis of a
network's traffic. Certainly, having k number of remailers in a network
under your control makes such analysis easier.
Yes. And as you look at this problem more closely (as I have been doing
ever since our conversation about this problem at the Cypherpunks meeting
in Santa Cruz a while back), the solutions become more elusive.
The big problems arise when the adversary has the ability to observe
messages in the network over time. Partitioning attacks and long-term
intersection attacks likely mean that the original Cypherpunk remailer
system is transparent to any entity which is able to view the traffic on
the entire network. (The attacks are passive, though they can be optimized
with some active interference.)
Big weak spots: client version information, statistics distribution, and
key rotation. In a system like Type I which relies on an external program
for the layered crypto, information about the user's software
distinguishes him from other users. Likewise, a user's choice of remailer
nodes in a selected chain may vary based on which "pinger" service he is
using, and whether he has updated his remailer keys after the remailer has
gone through a key rotation also gives away valuable information. These
and other distinguishing factors allow an attacker to partition the
main anonymity set into smaller sets. Over time, the attacker may be able
to plot the intersection of these sets such that he is able to identify a
given user based on his usage patterns and the information he is leaking.
Type III goes a long way to address many of these, but still falls short
of perfect. The particularly troubling issue at the moment is how to
distribute information about the reliability (as well as key information)
of remailers in the network such that every client is using the same set
of data in the same way. (If pingers, or reputation servers, could be
assumed to never disagree, this would be much easier. Unfortunately
experience and common sense tells us they cannot.)
There are some detailed discussions of this on the Mixminion list.
Right. The simplistic demonstration of this problem is the "n-1" attack,
discussed in detail on this list many times over the last decade.
George Danezis and I recently published a paper on an optimized method of
detecting and thwarting these attacks.
(Note that this does presume that there exists a good userbase, and the
n-1 attack conditions are a result of the attack, and not simply present
because of a significant shortage of users.)
I never assume that the location of nodes in multiple jurisdictions
protects a network against a global observer. I view it as an important
way of deterring forced collusion, but simple espionage passive is still
very possible irrespective of borders.
Indeed. The greatest point of attack on the Type II or stronger remailer
systems is the end points -- sender or receiver. If an attacker can
correlate one user's act of sending a message with another person's
receipt of an anonymous message (and can confirm this over time), the
remailer network can be treated as a black box, and needs no further
analysis of its internals in order to compromise its anonymity. This is
probably the greatest of the intersection attacks, and is made
significantly harder to conduct if a user is able to inject messages into
the remailer network unobserved. The best way to do this is to send your
remailer mail from the same server that runs an active remailer.
This is very true. And yet, users demand reply functionality. When Lance
Cottrell originally wrote Mixmaster, he designed it in a way which made
reply blocks impossible (as a side effect of protecting against replay
attacks.) Unfortunately, because of this there are still many users of the
Cypherpunk remailer system, and many remailers still operating that
protocol. (Even worse, one of the dominant implementations of Type I
remailers eschews the pool mix method in favor of a variation on
Kesdogan's S-G Mixes, and then uses the Windows Rand() function for
determining the time delay at each node. Ugh!)
Type III has a very clever way of doing replies, which I think is sound
from a security standpoint. I have come to believe that reply blocks are
not the best way of doing anonymous message receipt for a number of other
reasons, however, and am pursuing different methods based on PIR schemes.
Anonymizer is an entirely different beast, and suitable for a different
set of threats. If you have an adversary who is able to watch and analyze
the Internet in real time, a single trusted proxy is not your solution.
They do; there has been much work done by the academic researchers in this
area in the past few years. I've spent the last couple of years making
them aware of the Cypherpunks -- perhaps I should be doing the opposite as
Roger Dingledine keeps a nice bibliography of anonymity papers on his
site: I believe this is the right approach for replies. However, message pools
don't scale. (In order to protect against many attacks, each user would
have to download all messages. In order to work well, they must be a "send
everything everywhere" system.) Private Information Retrieval is
effectively an optimization on this approach that allows it to scale while
preserving the anonymity and reliability properties.
I have a draft of a paper that I am writing (with Bram Cohen) about such a
system. I will post a link to it here after I spend the next few days
correcting some minor mistakes.
As for sender anonymity systems, it would be great if you and other
Cypherpunks were to read the recent papers on the subject. We'd all
benefit from your input.
It is also worth noting that high-latency systems, like Mixmaster, face a
different set of threats than low-latency systems, like Freedom or Onion
Routing. There is overlap, but it is important to discuss these systems in
the context of their latency requirements, to make it known which set of
attacks are present.

@_subject: Re: For those who missed it: Hushmail is pwnd 
I wouldn't be so certain -- getting subpoenas is no big deal for
companies. At Anonymizer, I answered lots of them. Most of the time, I
couldn't comply. (If you pay for your Anonymizer account with your credit
card, and the Feds want to know if you bought an Anonymizer account, well,
you screwed up. Otherwise, I told the guy on the phone the truth -- I had
nothing in my logs about that IP address, sir. And they went away,
quickly and without fuss, unlike when I've had to deal with the same
thing as a private remop.)
Of course, that was in 2003 and times have changed all around -- I don't
think Hushmail was handing out info to TLAs back then either.
Possibly, the problem here is Hushmail's move away from using its Java
applet as default. (It has two modes now -- securish and securisher, from
what I can tell, and the more secure "everything happens in the browser,
including all key operations" part is the optional step now. In the less
secure case, while I haven't analyzed it yet, I believe the keys in those
cases are being stored decryptable on the server. The passphrase is
almost certainly passed to the server.)
But, also, bear in mind that Hushmail has *always* allowed people to send
non-PGP messages, especially to non-Hushmail users. If one party was a
Hushmail user, and one party was not a PGP user, then PGP's not going to
be involved.
Regardless, boo for Hushmail for not disclosing that they were answering
subpoenas like this.
There *are* bigger forces at play, though. The "mutual assistance"
provisions of the Council of Europe cybercrime treaty are horrible, as are
these data retention laws. These are going to affect companies based in
any country signed to that treaty, including the US.
Hushmail, in the end, is relatively weak compared to other Cypherpunk
tools, and other ways of using them. The big They are trying to make those
other tools and uses illegal. Already we have people in the academic
privacy field scampering to appease their new masters, and trying to find
ways to do backdoored anonymity safely (are you kidding me? We haven't
even worked out the kinks with regular anonymity systems.) But in the end,
those are academics scared that their field is going to be made illegal,
and so their actions are understandable, if deplorable.
Likewise for whatever Hushmail may be doing.
A statement from the folks over there would be nice.

@_subject: RE: Storm, Nugache lead dangerous new botnet barrage 
[Snip discussion about user cluelessness -- sure, I agree, though I
maintain hope that there is at least *some* attrition on that scale.]
Ah! There's a reason stronger than "because they can." Yes, I recognize
that the overhead is minimal, etc., etc. But without some compelling
reason (making it partitionable for resale, making it harder to disrupt,
etc.) I would not expect the botnet controllers to introduce another area
of possible failure -- one that not only increases CPU time, but
bandwidth, and makes maintaining and upgrading the code and compatibility
between instances more difficult.
I'm not sure that this *does* make it harder to disrupt the botnet,
though, does it? Does anyone have example traffic dumps of these encrypted
payloads? It should be possible to identify and block this traffic; it's
going to follow some unique pattern.

@_subject: RE: Storm, Nugache lead dangerous new botnet barrage 
I don't agree -- they *are* paying for the overhead. Not in dollars, but
in CPU cycles (and a minor programming overhead.) If you increase the
performance degradation on the hosts in the botnet, you're going to lose
some of those hosts due to the owners cleaning up the system so that they
can use it -- botnets survive because they steal CPU and bandwidth that is
"acceptable" to the users, or unnoticed by them.
Adding in additional computational overhead to the operation of the botnet
diminishes its overall capacity, either in the number of nodes, or in the
amount of work you can steal from the nodes without losing hosts, or both.
Your "DRM" answer, and coderman's comments, seem to be more on the mark.

@_subject: Re: How long can you go with an expired key? 
I think most of us use OTR now for communication we really care about
being private.
What you're seeing is more likely the impending death of email.
(Though, for the lack of concern for PGP key lifetimes/validity/use/etc.,
you might have a look at my LISA 2003 talk -- it's got some great quotes
in there from the cypherpunks and even one of the RFC 2440 authors about
the usability of PGP. That's not to say usability hasn't improved in the
last five years -- but it's more focused on enterprise systems -- so I'm
not surprised your "winner" was a commercial vendor.)
And the cypherpunks? That community has been dead for years. Y'all just
didn't get the memo. ;)

@_subject: Mixmaster 3.0 released 
Dear all,
[Apologies if you get multiple copies of this email.]
Mixmaster 3.0 has been released this week. This is the first major version
release since 2.9, and a continuation of that code, though it incorporates
numerous improvements, feature enhancements, and bug-fixes. It is
recommended that you upgrade your remailers to this version.
For those of you running 3.0rc1 or one of the 3.0 beta releases, the
changes are minor, though upgrading is still recommended.
Please report any problems you experience to the Mixmaster maintainers
through the bug tracker at SourceForge. (
The code can be found there as well, and is signed by the Mixmaster 3.x
release key, found on  and signed by myself and
numerous other cypherpunks. Any questions regarding tampering with the
source code should be reported as soon as noticed.
There are some user-facing improvements as well, though most of the
planned client improvements have been pushed off to 3.1. For stability
reasons, users of the client are encouraged to upgrade as well. (Users of
third-party GUIs for Mixmaster are encouraged to report their success or
problems with detailed bug reports if applicable.)
We're looking forward to your feedback!
Best regards, on behalf of the Mixmaster Development Team:

    * security products - mail encryption, intrusion detection, firewalls
    * malware analysis - detection, compensation, and mitigation of
      emerging threats
As a new feature this year, CodeCon will be presenting a Biohack! track.
While we will continue our tradition of presenting only one talk at a
time, a portion of one of the days' talks will be reserved for interesting
biotechnology hacking projects. A key requirement for these presentations
is ease of reproduction with minimal access to expensive laboratory
Example topics include:
    * Purifying DNA using common household items
    * Developing genetically-modified bacteria in a kitchen laboratory
    * Using specially-designed software to assist in bioengineering
    * The use of simple bioengineering techniques to solve real-world
      problems.
Ideal Biohack! Track submissions will have a strong emphasis on the
"hack" portion of the talk -- in the last few years, there has been a
strong growth in the community of biology hackers; we aim to bring these
hackers together to discuss their techniques for inexpensive, at home
experimentation in biological engineering research.
Presentations will be 30 minutes long, with an additional 15 minutes
allocated for Q&A. Overruns will be truncated.
Submission details:
Submissions are being accepted immediately. Acceptance dates are
