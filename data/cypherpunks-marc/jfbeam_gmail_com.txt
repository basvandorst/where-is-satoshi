And that's where their safe harbour evaporated.  Upon receiving notice a  file is infinging, they know that *file* is illegal, and must now remove  all the links to it, not just the one that was reported.  Mega is in a  possition to know all the links, where as the copyright holder is not.
They thought they had a gaping loophole.  Well, the DOJ is about to teach  them how wrong they are.

That's actually a standard practice.  It allows the uploader to file a  counterclaim and have the content restored.  One cannot "restore" what has  already been deleted.
However, never going back and cleaning up the undisputed content is a  whole other mess of dead monkeys.
