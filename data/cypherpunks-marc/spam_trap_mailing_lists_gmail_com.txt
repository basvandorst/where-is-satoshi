You're welcome!
Thanks for the info, will try out tomorrow.

Thanks for your feedback, much appreciated!
I am aware of the well known pgp-wordlist, however like you state when
using audio channels the pgp-wordlist may not be the best option for
non-native (US) English speakers, because it contains many words which
probably a lot of non-native speakers are not familiar with and have
then difficulties to write the words down. Then there is mnemonicodes
available, but the list in there
contains to many words, while it is more efficient when encoding.
Hence my humble approach.

Hi all,
I recently finished the English word list for my encoder/decoder and thought
I would share the program with you.
The software allows users with an offline computer and pencil and paper only
to use their favorite encryption software and then encode /decode small binary
blobs error free*, compared to other solutions IMHO.
I must admit that this procedure is a bit time consuming but it should give
users at least one more option in their tool set.
*I received today an encrypted postcard in QR-code but was not able to
decode the message, even with high dpi scan settings.
