That's the other question I had ... I keep hearing
about alt.cypherpunks, but there is nothing there -
regardless of whether I look through google groups or
other news2web or news2mail translations,
alt.cypherpunks is totally dead - maybe 1-2 posts per
month, and most of them test posts or garbage, and
this goes back at least for the last year...
Is there some secret or alternate news feed that has
the real list, or is alt.cyperpunks just dead ?

I wasn't paying attention when the lne node went away,
and was a bit lost in my CP mailing list subscription
for a few months...
I subscribed to minder, but it was a _joke_ in terms
of spam and bounces and all sorts of lameness in my
cypherpunks folder _and_ my inbox.  Further, I noticed
I was no longer seeing any posts by Tim May - I might
have been missing others as well, but he was
conspicuously absent.
So, I have unsubbed from minder and subbed to
al-qeada.net - hopefully they will be closer to LNEs
level of anti-spam excellence ... questions:
1. any comments on this level of spam and bounces,
etc., I saw from minder - does al-qeada use a more
LNE-like processor ?
2. Was tim may being filtered from minder, or is he
just gone now ?

@_subject: other mailing list recommendations ? 
Can anyone recommend any other mailing lists besides
cypherpunks to lurk on / read ?
The aspects of cypherpunks that I value are the strong
and opinionated stances on civil liberty issues, the
pro gun and preparedness stances, and the general tech
slant ... any suggestions ?
