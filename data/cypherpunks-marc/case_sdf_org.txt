This is silly - it assumes that there are only two intepretations of her - a true "collision" (something arbitrary computes to her digital signature, which she did not actually invoke) which is indeed as astronomically unlikely as you propose.
- another unlikely event whose probability happens to be higher than the But of course there is a much simpler, far more likely explanation, and that is that she is lying.
However ... this did get me to thinking ...
Can't this problem be solved by forcing Alice to tie her signing key to some other function(s)[1] that she would have a vested interest in protecting AND an attacker would have a vested interest in exploiting ?
I'm thinking along the lines of:
"I know Alice didn't get hacked because I see her bank account didn't get emptied, or I see that her ecommerce site did not disappear".
"I know Alice didn't get hacked because the bitcoin wallet that we protected with her signing key still has X bitcoins in it, where X is the value I perceived our comms/transactions to be worth."
Or whatever.
[1] I have no implementation details for this.  Especially the part about how Bob can determine that this tie has been made, and that the tie has sufficient value to assure him, etc.

Hello Gozu,
I disagree.  Once you move past the big "cloud" players, you get into a morass of small, cutthroat VPS providers who are all barely surviving on thin margins.  Without question you can find one that will respond very nicely to an "official" RFQ and a money order.  If you buy the MO from an actual bank, it will look very much like a cashiers check, etc. Alternatively, a pre-paid visa from somewhere like Simon malls, etc., works well.  The real hook is a single, annual payment, which will be impossible for them to resist.
That's one end of the spectrum...
The other end of the spectrum is a corporate front with an appointed agent, etc. - you can do this for less than $500, and then you can run everything under that.
Either way your name is not attached to it, and your home address, etc., isn't either.
The list may not appreciate my criticism, but the reality is we get about one post every six months from someone who literally has their door kicked in and their property stolen by the state.

It's *possible* that rich, white citizens of global north countries will not be called to account for these actions in the future.
Not everyone will be so lucky.  So, while we autistically fixate on minute details of traffic analysis theory for Tor users, we should once in a while focus on rubber hoses.
Don't run Tor from an IP with your name attached to it.  This has nothing to do with technical feasibility, charitable intentions or terms of tor-talk mailing list

Ahhh, finally.
This is the Godwins law of tor-talk - all threads eventually lead to some moron running a relay from their home Internet connection.
To be fair, if we let the thread run long enough, I'll bet Mr. Do-Gooder-Port-Scanner is running from home, too.  Comedy from all tor-talk mailing list

Imagine biting your nails for the entire statute of limitation period.
You are one coding/implementation/vuln/exploit away from being brought right back in again.
Of course they will keep the raw data, and won't uppity district attorneys periodically check bugtraq for truecrypt related items ?
