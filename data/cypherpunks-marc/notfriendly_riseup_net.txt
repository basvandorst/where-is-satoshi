Meh politicians have the option to be good except they never are.

I agree. There isn't proof (yet at least) that he did anything wrong. I agree that like everyone else he should have the right to a fair trial. Your correct the tor project shouldn't and I also believe wouldn't attempt to censor speech (considering that they develop an online anonymity and anti-censorship tool). I also agree that due to many (not all) people's lack of ability to read everything before making up their mind it makes it all the more easier to harm someone's reputation. There might be people who were actually hurt but we don't know if it's true

I couldn't agree more with your statement. Someone quickly makes an accusation by the way the domain and hosting was done anonymously. It's hosted by  with Privacy Protected Whois Contact Information by "Privacy Protection Service INC d/b/a PrivacyProtect.org". If they are going to make such a statement they could at least state who they are. The site has several resource links to a GitHub Repository and even links to Jacob's Github Account (or what appears to be). I'm not sure if they are trying to make it look like Jacob made the site himself (if so it was done from a private repository). It might be worth mentioning that  is offline at the moment. I'm not sure if it's been like that or not. Any thoughts.

I hope that he is reading the messages as well. As to the checking if he is at his apartment thing that might be seen as invasive to his privacy. He is isn't responding to messages he might want to be left alone for a little while.

I would just let people have a break for a little while.

Oh ok. I wasn't sure. Well that removes worries/concerns on that end

I find it concerning we haven't heard from him. His website is also offline (the one listed on his twitter) which is also worrying.

He might need time to himself for now. He has a lot of people talking about him right now. He probably needs a break.
