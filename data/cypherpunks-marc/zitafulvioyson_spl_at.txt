B K A very beautiful girl walked up to a department store's fabric counter  and
said, "How much is this?""Only a kiss a meter," replied the smirking man
assistant."That's fine." replied the girl. "I'll take for meters." The
assistant quickly measured the material, wrapped it and then gave it to the
girl. Taking it, the girl turned and pointed to an old man standing beside her. "MY grandpa will pay the bill." she said.

his friend's house, a big dog ran out and began to bark at him. The
Frenchman was frightened and stopped. At that moment the Englishman came out

proverb, and you know the proverb, but, does the dog know the proverb?"
