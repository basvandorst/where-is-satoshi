I am Chinese and I have something to say..
actually, the Real-ID Internet already built in China in 6 years ago.
The Police in China can type your email/username or something else
information into a system called "Cyber identity analysis system" that can
analysis your realname and your home address even you didn't provide your
real identity. The data comes from ISP and websites, local police can use
some executive order to force ISP to record all of the data (maybe Port
Mirroring) then send the records to the police(yes, include your
password)..The executive order is also applied to websites that based on
China, they will force Chinese Company to send all of the userdata include
password ( to police.
The only way to avoid China's police is use Tor and use a different
username/email/password for each site..
