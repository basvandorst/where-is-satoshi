Not keen at all.  In some countries in Europe it's already almost
impossible for ISPs to provide Secure Shell to their customers, as they
are required by law to be able to hand over all data in unencrypted form
if possible.  Given that the decryption is done at some point they'd
have to backdoor their sshd's to log all session keys or even all
sessions in plaintext in order to comply...
Remember that the feds can bend reality (or, put less wildly, adapt new
laws) to suit their needs.

False: "On our production frontend machines, SSL/TLS accounts for less than 1% of the CPU load, less than 10KB of memory per connection and less than 2% of network overhead. Many people believe that SSL takes a lot of CPU time and we hope the above numbers (public for the first time) will help to dispel that."
