Link to Trailer: From my friend Lisa, sent few days ago...  <3
Hope you are well! Been a long time :-)
I'm making movies to teach the world more about Aaron Swartz and to help
the public better understand whistleblowers and whistleblower upload
I wanted to let you know about my little Kickstarter campaign for a movie I
am producing independently, "From DeadDrop to SecureDrop" - it's about
"SecureDrop," an anonymous upload system for whistleblowers that Aaron
prototyped with Kevin Poulsen, one month before his death, that connects
directly to news organizations (such as the Washington Post, Forbes, and
The New Yorker):
Here's a Tweet about it, if you're short on time:
Please help fund "From DeadDrop to SecureDrop" and help more potential
Whistleblowers learn about  I'm including a description of the project below! It's only going on for 4
more days, and I only have about $5,000 of the $20,000 I'm trying to raise,
so any help -- or also Tweets and social media love would be greatly
Thanks! :)
Much love,
The film is entitled "From DeadDrop to SecureDrop," and provides a
historical account of how the "SecureDrop" open source anonymous
whistleblowing submission platform was originally prototyped by Kevin
Poulsen and Aaron Swartz, and later, after Aaron's death, how it made its
way its current home at the Freedom of the Press Foundation.
People in the film (so far) include: Wired's Kevin Poulsen (how he was
inspired by WikiLeaks and then convinced Aaron to work with him on the
project), Trevor Timm and John Perry Barlow (of the Freedom of the Press
Foundation), who sought out the DeadDrop prototype, Garrett Robinson
(SecureDrop's current Development Lead) and Bill Budington (an EFF engineer
who worked directly on the early codebase), and some influential figures
familiar with the issues, such as Brewster Kahle (Founder of the Internet
Archive and co-founder, with myself, of Aaron Swartz Day) and Cindy Cohn
(Executive Director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation). I also
interviewed Virgil Griffith (Tor2Web and Wikiscanner), as he and Aaron were
good friends and worked on Tor2Web together.
Jacob Applebaum has agreed to be interviewed for the film. (Besides being a
WikiLeaks volunteer, he was good friends with Aaron.) Also, Sarah Harrison,
who stood by Edward Snowden's side in Hong Kong and the Moscow airport, and
assisted with getting him safe asylum in Russia, has agreed to be in the
After learning more about whistleblower Chelsea Manning (in the course of
my preparing to read her statement during my live Aaron Swartz Day event)
video:  statement:
I came to realize that the film really needs to expand beyond the subject
of the SecureDrop technology itself, to attempt to explain *why* these
whistleblowers might decide to use WikiLeaks or SecureDrop to expose
corruption in the first place: To inform the public and make the world a
better place. I realize this sounds simple and obvious, but I don't think
that most people are actually aware of this. Here's a post explaining how
Ed Snowden chose the Constitution over a Non-Disclosure agreement, when he
decided to blow the whistle: A third theme of the movie deals directly with an observation made by more
than one of the people I interviewed for the film, about how SecureDrop
will "help the next Ed Snowden" communicate with Journalists safely (so no
one will have to go through what he went through, just to get a story out).
The film suggests that SecureDrop could potentially usher in a new
generation of whistleblower: One that won't necessarily have to put their
whole life at risk, in order to "do the right thing."

Maybe a man can't see it, but even the most stupid woman in the world can
notice an evident *lie* in the last statment published.
The obvious efforts trying to adjust the accusations to being more
realistic and plausible, giving also more colours and emotions, are pretty
interesting.  I like it!  ;)
I didn't stop to search for some trustworthy information and for more
references in last days.
A programmer (woman) told me some 'juicy gossip' about one of alleged
victims, but it would be pretty disgusting to tell it here.  Ugh!  :-/
Well, in thesis, one of alleged victims is being hypocrite and hates
Jacob.  It was obvious since the first message, but some of the reasons
were unexpected for me, at least.  I need to search more information about
it and verify if it is really true before invite her to write a statment or
tell more about it in a trial.
Another tech woman, a brutally sincere friend who I love a lot and consider
one of the most intelligent persons that I know, perceived the lie that I
mentioned before I point it to her.  It simply does not make sense...  :-/
I always says my friend is a 'feminazi' who hates all the men and she knows
about it and says even worse things about me, hahaha!!  She is really
bitter sometimes, but pretty realistic and I do love extremely sincere
friends, haha!!  ;D
Well, she knows in person Jake, Isis and a lot of people mentioned and
doesn't like anyone.  None of them, I swear.  :P
Told me some stories about egocentrism, injured pride, politics, money,
etc, and asked me to avoid this kind of f*cking harmful crazy people
because I am too stupid to protect myself, haha!!  It makes sense, but now
I am curious about the truth, haha!!  ;D
She asked me to avoid meetings with one of alleged victims at any cost,
because "she is a f*cking sick jealous crazy b*tch", able of killing me and
tell lies about self-defense or psychotical breaks and lapses of memory in
public.  My friend is a bit neurotic, but is a good woman and is just
worried about me, hihi...  ;)
Just in case, the world is really small and I will contact one of the
ex-partners of this alleged victim in special.  I don't know him, but I
would like to know if she likes scandals, lies, breaking objects, this kind
of crazy stupid actions...  She has an ego much bigger than usual and I
know that Jake has the same problem, ugh!  :P

You use a lot the adjective "decent".  Please, your patterns of decency are
_not_ exactly the same adopted in a punk community or even in several
countries around the world.  Mine, for example.
I am not being ironic or agressive.  I am talking too serious with you.
Sorry, asking for moderation here, in this specific list, makes no sense.
It would be really wrong.
I was banned from tor-talk mailing list for defending a victim of brutal
harassment and accusations with no proofs.  This victim is my friend and is
being attacked for a lynch mob.  Is it not decent for you?
I already had seen Jake in several talks before, but he just becomes my
friend when I saw him crying for Aaron Swartz.  I learned to love him after
it.  I was crying next to him and I was a cute, fragile, young girl, but he
prefered to comfort and to hug a fat, tall, not so young man, who was
crying much more than us together.
Jake never knowed, but the tall North-American guy that, years ago, he
hugged in a so sweet way is one of the persons that I more respect in the
whole world.  I could die for this guy now if he needs it, because he has a
huge, amazing heart, one of the kindest souls that I know and he really
believes in a better world and works hard for it.
I think Jake never will remember me, but that was the first time I saw him
as a friend.  Jake was not a "rock star" (ridiculous expression used for
some people), he was just a sad boy crying for a dead friend, for Aaron's
lost dreams...  I've spent a long time just seeing them hugging each other
and, even not being the best of creatures, I sincerely prayed for them,
asking God to bless both and Aaron' soul and his family.
When Jake left my friend, I also hugged him, my huge lovely crying teddy
bear...  Jake saw our hug with some curiosity because he saw me watching
them for a long time.  I was hugging my friend and Jake saw my eyes still
crying.  My head was almost behind my friend's arm, because he is much,
really much taller than me.  Jake was not so close and made me a signal,
asking me if I needed something.  I smiled, so he smiled and finally left
the room.
After it, I already saw Jake crying, blushing, smiling, laughing, missing
more friends, dead and alive...  God, do you really think that would be
decent to let stupid blind people destroy my friend's life?!  If you think
it is decent, sorry, I reject your concept of decency now and will reject
it all the days of my life.
I prefer to be banned of all existent mailing and discussion lists than
supporting something so infamous, so disgusting...
Take care and (re)think about your concepts of decency, please.

If the people behind ja.group are still subscribed, even after using two
fake accounts to humilliate and harass a person, why can't I be subscribed

Some of the people behind the lynch mob already told their names and they
are still in the tor-talk list.  Only two fake accounts were banned.  The
real accounts are normally subscribed.  Not fair, not reasonable.  It says
a lot about the moderation team's preferences.
If I had told lies using a fake account, my personal account would be still
protected and subscribed.  Instead, I decided to expose myself in an honest
way and I am being punished for not using a fake account to defend Jake.

hypocrite people.

saying that banning all the people that tor-fascists banned was 'justified'

Hey, I did not say it at all, hard headed Juan!  :P
But it is their list and their rules, being unjust or not.  If they want to

will lose credibility, respect and collaborators.  Their problems, not mine.
If censorship is OK 'sometimes', then she can't complain about being

it, if necessary.  Social rules, for example:  - In the Summer, I really
prefer to be nude all the time, but I use clothes or I will be arrested.
Reading the tor-talk list is not possible because my personal positions are

a Federal Court to judge a person trying to read a list and not using the
same courts to judge persons who created that site is really bizarre.
Here, the ja.group would be judged for three different crimes against  (a

Oh, it was pretty obvious.  So sorry, Quinn, I thought it was a neurosis of

how to behave as a member of decent society. Threatening to rejoin a
mailing list one has just been booted from, is not how decent people behave.
My dear, I was waiting for Boyce's answer.  I asked humbly after his
offenses and had no answers, so I gave up.  Sorry, I won't die or be sick
because of it.  I cried yesterday, I admiss, but just because it was really
stupid calling me a "rape apologetics".
Today is a new day and I have several perspectives for my life and my
studies.  I don't need tor-talk list, it is past.  I will never use lies to
subscribe there.  My nature is really easy to understand.  I used my real
name and a public account in all the moments.  I like true colors.
And being sincere, probably I already read much more Law books and holy
books  (not only the Bible)  than you and I think it is really complex to
define how "decent people behave".  I don't have this kind of pretention.

I simply asked to Boyce if I could re-subscribe again and told him what is
happening.  I told him I asked about the tor-talk list moderation rules
weeks ago and had no answer about it.  I told him why I think it was really
disgusting and sick to call me a "ludicrous rape apologetics".  I told him
to put me under moderation, but permissing me to learn more about the Tor
Project, reading the list.  I promised to be on topic only.  Answers?  No,
I didn't receive any answer.
I don't know if someone told lies about it, but he didn't answer to my
messages and I gave up.  I said earlier that I won't waste more tears and
time with a loser able of calling a "rape apologetics" a victim of rape.
It was really unfair and cruel and, sorry, only a sick person makes this
kind of thing.
Boyce is the kind of guy able of telling lies to manipulate dumber people.
Ja.group proved it is pretty easy.
I know it can be really hard for you understand it, but some people around
the world really like to avoid guns, lies and moralist hypocrite discourses.
Ja.group members are still subscribed on tor-talk list and, as they did
before, they simply will create another account to post there.  I said I
want to use my real name and this personal account.  It is not hard to
understand it, is it?  :)

I have no much pride.  I don't care about "begging", if the reasons are
important for me and other persons.
I want to learn more about Tor Project and I want to do it using my real

lists.  I have lots of accounts, but this is the public one, the less
important account.
I hate moderation, but I was and I am moderator in several lists, because I
am considered transparent and everybody can contact me easily, Juan.
My personal convictions about avoiding moderation at any cost, in a recent
past, had a really negative impact in one of the lists that I used to
moderate.  A poisounous guy made a real chaos in the discuss list.
It was a disaster because I knowed him in person and everybody knows I
really liked him a lot.  I wrote several advertising messages before put
him in moderated mode.  I never banned a person and he was the only person
that I put under moderation until now.
After being advertised about the moderation, he left a much more than 2.000
persons list, who always said "love too much", and offended me in several
personal channels, including cell phone and messengers.  I received dozens
of cruel messages telling about my friends' impressions about me.
After his disgusting messages for me, I was completely sure that I was
right choosing to moderate him and his destructive e-mails.  I was
protecting the readers of the list, Juan.  It was a proof of consideration
and respect, not censure.
A moderator can be an injust person and I already was victim of it several
times, but the moderator role in all the lists is protecting them and their
members.  I am a moderator and already was under moderation.  I know both

Hi, Digitalfolklore!
Hope you wanted to send this message to cypherpunks lists, not for me in

I don't know exactly what is happening, but received some strange private
messages in different channels about Wikileaks.  Err...  Why me?  Did
someone say something or is just my famous oriental charm?  :-/
Usually, I love Wikileaks, but I do not support some of their last
actions.  Everybody knows about strange leaks to manage USA elections, the
Turkish leaks and deleted bizarre tweets.  These things annoyed me a lot.
I wasn't tweeting in the last times, but, few days ago, I admiss I tweeted
about    and retweeted one of Wikileaks' account
tweets about Jake.  Just it.
Only a cordial relationship between an institucional account and a poor
unknowed follower, who had lost a lot of friends, contacts and followers in
last months.  I am only lurking on twitter, avoiding flaming wars and
boring people.  No much patience for all the drama.
It's my usual behaviour in foreign lists too.  I only broke my typical
pattern because of Jake.  I was already an old reader here and on tor-talk
list, before being kickbanned.  I am very noisy and chaotical, and my
English stinks more than someone's... little cat!  So, silence is always
more comfortable for me, even being a talkative troll.  :)
Am I guilty of some of their bad leaks and was not informed about it yet?
They were noisy and chaotical, but not mine!  :)
Ah, I always make a lot of strange things, but not personalized panties.
If you want Snodew or Assange panties, you can suggest the idea to
Wikileaks.  Certainly they will be very sexy, but not like the charming
"Put in" panties, hihi!  :)

Definitely, without any doubt, I am the world's worst programmer, but this

I love esoteric programming languages and "hello world" using ArnoldC is
pretty cute!  I didn't know this language!  <3
But this is my favorite language, the only one that makes me feel like a
great ninja programmer, yay!!!  :D
Unnecessary is an esoteric programming language. The language is named
'Unnecessary' because of the method this programming language works: the
source file is unnecessary; in fact the existence of source code file leads
to critical error. In case of critical error the interpreter must stop
immediately and report the error.
Unnecessary has no instructions/commands. You can do nothing with this
language, so using it is unnecessary as well. The whole Unnecessary program
is NOP. Or actually, there should be no Unnecessary programs, since only
valid Unnecessary program is a non-existing source code file.
The goal was to create a programming language that is easy to learn, not
very useful, doesn't require input or do output, has no memory, has no
instructions. Only an interpreter is required. As well, good thing is that
distributing Unnecessary programs is extremely easy, and can be done
without computers. As well, storage is no problem: you can have infinite
amount of Unnecessary programs in a memory bit. Actually, storing them
requires less memory than a bit.
Every valid program, however, is a quine. That's the only possible program,
and the only valid form of program. In Unnecessary creating a null quine
doesn't even require the existence of the empty program file, as in other
languages. Has programming ever been easier?(Not to mention that it isn't
even possible to write anything else than bug-free code!)
Oh, and the valid Unnecessary program file extension is "unn".

Being sincere, my dear grarpamp, I didn't have courage enough to see the
videos that you sent yesterday yet.
Yesterday, I was pretty sensitive to sounds and it was a day without music
because of my migraine.  Today, I confess I had no courage to see videos
after reading Lauren's post.  I hate violence and injustice and my stomach
is pretty weak in some moments.
I sent your last message to Lauren and I am copying him in this message,
because he can consider interesting your new references and I do love and
respect him a lot.
Sorry, instead reading about that disgusting crime, today I will finish a
book  ("When Breath Becomes Air" by Paul Kalanithi; amazing book, but
terribly sad!)  and cook some comfortable food, because I am still feeling
pain...  :((((
Tender kisses, thanks for your links!!!  <3

USA killed great part of my dad's family.  They used nuclear weapons to
destroy lifes and cities.  Japan was already deeply destroied when they
decided to test their nuclear bombs.  My dad's family used to live in
Hiroshima.  You know what happened with them.
My mom always says it was racism, that US probably would use the bombs in
some oriental country or in Africa anyway, because oriental people and
black people are always considered inferior people there.  They are not
Caucasian, they are different physically, they have different ways of
being, beliefs, religions, food, etc.
Well, the problem is not North American prejudice, but all the prejudices.
All the people have difficulties to understand, to accept and to respect
differences, to manage their personal references.
USA and Germany used the war as an excuse to test their new toys playing
with human lifes.  Japan, Italy, England, France, all the other countries
didn't do the same just because they had not 'new toys' or they probably
had played with them in a cruel way too.
The problem was not the country, but all the wars.  There are lots of good
people in all the countries, in all the places.  A country is not a villain
or the good guy, Zenaan.  Russia is not better than USA.  They are
different countries and have different backgrounds.  Both deserves respect.
It would not be rational to hate USA for killing my family.  Lots of people
there also lost their families in that stupid and cruel war.  I need to
hate all the wars,governments, bad people, cruelty and lies, not USA.
(Certainly, mosquitos too.  Maybe also Vegemite.)
Take care, everybody!  Have a lovely weekend and lots of love and fun!  <3

Zenaan, my dear, your country serves Vegemite to children.  It's a pretty
serious crime against humanity and it occurs daily, in all Australian
It has lots of sodium, a disgusting flavour and stinks more than my
disastrous homemade Sauerkraut.  Am I saying "Hail Australia", Land of
Vegemite and Home of Crocodilo Dundee?  :-)
This crime was horrible, really shocking and sad, but the point is
recognizing publicly the existence of a repulsive crime and never more
permiss that something similar occurs in the whole world, not just
criticizing a country.  Sorry, it doesn't make sense.
I do love my country, but it never will be a blind stupid love.  There are
lots of disgusting crimes here and also in your country, in the USA, in
Russia, in the whole world.  No exceptions.
The USA are not my favorite country, but it was not a regional problem.
Violent crimes happen in every single country of this world, including
Russia.  Please, remember it.
Ah, for your knowledge, I hate all the governments, including Russian.  No
exceptions here too.  As Mirimir, I love Russian people, but it is too much
innocence believing that Russian government is better than North-American
government.  Both are disgusting.

Zen, I didn't know Master Y-Oda was here, but it was an unexpected joy.  I
call him 'FOdastico Mestre YOda'  (something like "F*cking Fantastic Master
YOda")  and several other strange names, because he is almost a "ninja
master" in several subjects, is a very practical person and has an awesome
sense of humor.
Yesterday, I wrote a long letter to a hackerspace and mentioned Master
Y-Oda as reference.  Believe me, you can not agree with his opinions and
suggestions, as I also do in some moments, but this guy does deserve our
respect, Zen.
Oda is able of discreetely trolling governments, always smiling and
listening to music.  Not necessarily good music, because we have pretty
different musical tastes in some moments, haha!!  ;D
He not only thinks out the box, he kicks the box, my dear.  Oda has an
amazing sense of humor, a fantastic intelligence, a strong personality and
a lovely hair.  Not so gorgeous as ryziek's hair, of course, but I love Oda
and all the things that make him so special.  Kind soul, practical actions,
unexpected ideas, creative hackings, dark sense of humor and beautiful hair
included, haha!!  ;D
Governments, police, teachers and my own parents can't make me stop an
argument.  Oda can do it just saying "Stop, Ceci".  I think it shows you
how much I respect him.  I have good reasons for it, Zen.
He was trying to help.  If you didn't appreciate his suggestions, believe
me, he absolutely doesn't care.  The same about being an anarchist

The removal of content is happening since last month, my dear Lots of strange things are happening and there is evident censorship in
some places when you mention Jake's name.
This kind of thing makes me feel really upset and I am considering if was
correct to avoid cruel gossip, because it is disgusting, vile.  "JA group"
used this kind of despicable resource, but they are not a good and healthy
reference for normal people, with a little bit of ethics.  "Decent people",
using Quinn's favorite expression.  "Sane people", in my own code of ethics.
I never asked Jake about this fact, because it would sound disgusting and
non sense for him and he already has lots of more relevant worries.  I used
this embarrassing information for my personal conviction only.
We can't use this information in a trial, but I am sure he had no sexual
contact or approach with one of the alleged victims because he has a very
sensitive nose.
Jake is very clean and really cares a lot about personal hygiene.
Everybody knows how much he cares about his apparence and his smell always
is good, even after a longer talk.  A comfortable smell that remembers me
"cleanliness", daily baths and use of cleaning products, like soap,
shampoo, etc.
It is an important detail for a Brazilian person.  We do love water and
baths.  Brazilians usually are considered "bath addicteds" and "maniacs for
cleanliness, hygiene products and perfums" in whole world.
The girl is knowed in some activist circles for _not_ having an accurate
hygiene and for several disgusting intimate smells.  One of her ex-lovers,
who I've knowed in person, confirmed me it some weeks ago and I really felt
bad for her.
I don't know her in person and I don't know if she has a disease or just
unsanitary, unhygienic habits, but being associated with "sour cream",
"rotten cheese" and other bizarre odors is very humilliating.  He never had
courage to lick any part of her body and left her after two disastrous
sexual meetings.
Jake never would touch a stinky person in an intimate way.  He is too clean
for it and he could have sex with a better person very, very easily.
Sorry, I can't believe it.  He probably would reject her sexual advances,
exactly like her ex-lover did.
She is a revengeful person and, well, a rejected woman is the Hell in a
human form.  She said his ex-lover is gay and he doesn't like sex to some
people.  He is not gay and likes sex a lot, but only with clean women.  Not
her case!  :P
It was childish and cruel, but I confess when I was angry, I tried to play
with two horrible versions of "Smelly Cat"  (one of Phoebe' songs, Friends
sitcom),  provisionally called "Smelly Pussy" and "Smelly Little Cat" just
for making Jake laugh a bit.  It was a bad idea and I left it at all.  Jake
deserves good music and I sing like a banshee dying, uh!  :((
(I don't know if it is really used, but they teach a pussy is a "little
cat" for foreign people and I just learned it can be a bad word when I
tried to explain how much I love puppies and kittens to my ex-boyfriend.  I
said "I love pussies" and he laughed for a long time before explaining my
mistake...  d'oh!  :P)
Tender kisses.  Wish you all a lovely day!  :*
Cecilia, at hospital, in a horrible mood...  I've spent my whole week

sent me and I read it yesterday, at hospital, while complaining about God's

It was published under a Creative Commons license and I need to thank the
author for being so generous and fun.  He made me smile while my
temperamental body was rejecting medicines, so his book is good, hihi...  ;)

and my friends in all the moments.  Hope God, if exists, can love and feel
compassion for every single person in this crazy world.
I have Muslim friends and I was very frustrated yesterday because I've
found a Brazilian Telegram group saying awful, disgusting things about the
Islamism.  All the religions are about love.  There are crazy radical

Hi, Justin!  Hope you are doing fine!  :)
I liked your project a lot and forwarded the message you had originally
sent to the list "Data Driven Journalism and Open Data in Journalism" to
two different lists.
A Brazilian guy wants to talk with you about the project.  He contacted me
and I asked to talk directly to you.  And, well, Flipchan sent this cute
message now:
curl(ing) them with multiple threads in py?:)
Sorry, my programming is still a shame, even worst than my English.
Please, may you answer to the questions?  I am curious and will forward
your answer to Python Brazil list too!  :)
Thank you very much!  Good luck and success!  <3

about 24K bytes of RAM.
In that environment, the only other language to do system programming
was the machine's assembler, and C was a great improvement, since it
had structures to give names to data fields and enough of a type
structure to keep you from using a floating point value as an integer

I really love Ed Sheeran's cover of Bob Dylan's protest song "Masters of
War".  The lyrics are very powerful, really beautiful and intense.  I love
this song.
"Masters Of War"  (Bob Dylan)
Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks.
You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly.
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain.
You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion'
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud.
You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins.
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do.
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul.
And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead.

I was writing an answer to Juan, talking about 'sexism' and feminism, but
decided to search about the relations about anarchism, feminism and also
sexism.  I've found several references and different concepts, some of them
a bit confuse and contraditory.
So, it would be unfair to say Juan was wrong.  Some writers think he's
right, but some anarcha-feminists say the 'sexism' really exists and use
this exact word in their texts.  :P
After some reading, I thought it would be more logical to understand the
anarchism decently, before analyzing its relations with feminism and,
maybe, with 'sexism'.  Mental masturbation takes additional time, but is
always fun, hihi!  :)
I've found different definitions of 'sexism' on internet and, being
sincere, I thought some of them are so 'sexist' as the prejudice that they
want to avoid.  There are some good, reasonable definitions, but most of
them were very frustrating.  Meh!  Better to study a bit more and have my

I suggest to watch "Grave of the Fireflies", if someone wish to pay tribute

It's beautiful and sensible, but also one of the saddest 'anime'  (Japanese

Not for being Japanese, not for showing the Second World War, but because
it shows the point of view of  children.  Children starving, crying, losing
their parents and dying without ever understanding the war.
In all the wars, what always worries me the most are the children, their
traums.  They don't have any guilt and always suffer all the pain.
Sorry, I didn't find the animated movie with English subtitles on line,

that you can watch only once in your life.  I, probably, was not brave

very offensive for everybody, because my friend always was a woman, since
her birth.  She was not born a man.  I was talking about chromosomes,

Jake always considered himself a queer, bisexual man.  It was part of his
"problems" when he was publicly judged for his sexuality.  A lot of
moralist, hypocrite people judging his gender, his sexual preferences, not
his character, his real acts.
I've "lost" a "friend", because she said "Jake certainly raped these
people, once he was promiscuous enough to have sexual intercourses with
both genders".
So much prejudice, aff...  Very disgusting.  Judge a person for their

All the times when I read River, I remember it's a pseudonym very used in
sites of sex stories about BDSM or to contact eventual sexual partners.
The same about Rain, Forest and other nicknames like these.  I don't know
if it was just a coincidence, a bad joke or if it is their nature, their
sexual preference.
Well, usually, a vanilla person would not choose this kind of pseudonym,
but I really don't care about their sexual practices.  I just think it's
very fun see chaste, immaculate, innocent vanilla people using hardcore
BDSM nicks.  Really hypocrite, considering that Jake, in some moments, was
judged for his sexuality, not for his character.
I am late with some really important answers, but as I told to a contact
some days later, and repeated to another person today, Jake always
respected me and all my female friends a lot, acting like a real gentleman
and, believe me, some of them are beautiful women and tried to flirt with
him hardly.  :P
He was a very handsome, charismatic, sexy, famous, intelligent man, walking
among lots of all kinds of activists, men and women, in several events
around the whole world.  Very glamorous.  Becoming one of his lovers or
girlfriends was a way of increasing social status, so he really refused a
lot of crazy invasive people to avoid problems and being related to these
people.  He could have sex very easily, in all the places and parties,
without "raping" someone.
I saw it happening in person.  He was very professional and gentle,
refusing more intimate contacts in a polite and discreet way.  He rejected
one of my personal friends in a Brazilian event and she is a young
intelligent woman, much more beautiful and interesting than me.  It is
strange for a 'serial rapist', a crazy psychopath, isn't it?  :-/
Well, let's wait to discover what will happen.  There are lots of things
that simply don't make sense in all this drama.  It would not be rational
or reasonable.
Kisses and hugs for all of you!  :*  <3
PS:  -  Ah, a silly curiosity!  One of "Rivers" liked a lot to write about

I never received an answer, but it was an interesting experience.  I think
this River in special is a girl, not a guy, and she is very intelligent.
Their stories are very disturbing  -  too 'eeck!!!' for my taste, ugh!  -,
but are intelligent and she got some archetypical desires, with subtle
references to Greek legends.  She is not a stupid girl trying to get
audience.  (Different of the j.a. group members' initial pattern, haha!!)

We are pleased to accounce that Tor Browser 6.0.4 is ready for testing.
Bundles can be found on:
This release finally brings Tor Browser users the latest Tor stable,
0.2.8.6, and avoids pinging Mozilla servers for system extensions.
The latter was responsible for users getting an extension into their Tor
Browser that resulted in annoying and confusing "Your Firefox is out o=
date" notifications on start-up (bug 19890). Thanks to Mozilla enginee=
who fixed that issue as fast as possible on their side: the extension is
not shipped to Tor Browser users anymore if they ping Mozilla's server.=
Users that are on the alpha channel or are using the hardened Tor
Browser were not affected. The same goes for Tails users as far as we know.=
The full changelog since Tor Browser 6.0.3 is:
Tor Browser 6.0.4 -- August 16

not being sued.
His name is Jacob Appelbaum and he's innocent.  "Rapey Jakey" is an
expression very offensive and rude.  He is a loyal friend, a lovely person
and always was a great privacy activist, who really contributed to IT
Security community with his time, coding, talks, researches and studies.
All this bad gossip seems more important now than years of hard work, than
his legacy to our community and it's disgusting and unfair.
Please, less drama, more reason.  Please, don't let smear campaigns without
evidences and proofs being stronger than several years of real
contributions to privacy studies.
Even the people who don't like him as person, know his good work at Tor

defend us against governments and their vigilantism.

the first message, seeing the life in a not too serious way.  This thread
is full of shit about Jake and it has begin with a slander.  Jake deserves
joy, laugh, smiles, tickles, snugglehugs, cupcakes and our love.
The JA Group deserves laugh too, but because they are a bad joke.  A stupid

Jake is alive, is a winner and is very happy all the times when one more
lie is finally considered false in public.  I miss the happy Jake,
laughing, smiling and I want to listen to his laugh in public again, maybe
cooking onions with him.  ;)
His life is still a celebration, because he always had a hard life and is a

Deny the Holocaust, the genocide, the awful massacre of innocent people, is

destruction of Hiroshima using a nuclear bomb, another horrible and
disgusting massacre...  He apologized for his declaration, but I never will

It was the original message.  I was hoping the troll could discuss with me,

I apologize everybody for this failed try and, in special, if someone felt,

eventually dead people will even think that they're still alive ;)
Dead people don't think, Mirimir.  Why do you think I tried the suicide?
Just for fun?  I was bored, with lots of free time on my hands, and
thought  "Hey, let's try to discover in person if God, Heaven, Hell,
Saints, angels, all these things really exist?"  :)
Well, almost died twice, in different situations years ago.  In one of
them, in the Intensive Care Unity of the hospital, when I almost gone
forever, it was the only moment when the strong pain stopped.  I did not
see any light, any angel, but felt a deep inner peace.  I felt so much
harmony.  It was like to feel complete again, a so intimate and serene
happiness.  It was warm, cozy, sweet.  Absolute perfection.
You will never know the true.  Nobody will knows. :)
Death.  No pain.  No fear.  No thoughts.  No feelings.  No traums.  No
memories.  No nightmares.  No broken hearts.  No lies.  No masks.  No
labels.  No judgements.  No Injustice.  Simply, pure and absolute No
But, well, there will be still chemical elements and all my Carbon will
become something new.  The beautiful circle of life.  <3
The human being is so contraditory and confused that even writing all these
things, I am seriously "life addicted".  I really love being alive.
Even when I cry and complain about feeling my heart destroyed, I remember a
beautiful music, poetry or thing that still make me feel smile.  There is
so much beauty in the world, my love.  Even when deeply hurt, when feeling
emotional and physical pain, I simply can't ignore so much beauty.  I tried
sometimes, but it's impossible.
And there are so amazing people in the world.  Even when I want to die, it
is impossible to me avoiding to smile when I listen children laughing,
happy, innocent.  Or when I see a happy puppie wagging its tail for me,
asking to play.  Or when I see the blue sea and feel its smell and the wind
playing with my hair.  Or when I think about my family.  I think it is
love, isn't it?

Yes, you do are a troll.
In your first message on this list, you used the nick "jaun" and asked
about John Young and Cryptome  (thread:  "Cryptome run by feds").  In
another topic  (thread:  "Number of onions online", you mentioned that
"[Tor] is [used 99,9% for] illegal activity and drugs".  And the rest is
for your "honey pot"."
Your first message using the nick "roosty", about Cloudfire, on the thread

Your second message using the nick "rooty" was bizarre and aggressive.  You
posted the link for one of

Being sincere, I had no stomach for watching this video, named "How Savage

have the Cypher Piggie from Hell patterns, not me and never John Young.  I
am not a "nigga", troll, I am a "Jap", but offending my black bros is
really to ask for being kicked right in the balls.  Remember it.
Your next thread was "Xorcist = Coderman".  Guy, Xorcist and Coderman are
different persons, with different styles and points of view.  Horrible
bet!  You just offended Xorcist and, if he is still alive and reading the
list, Coderman.
And, finally, this absurd thread "Cypher piggie = JY = sea sea".

be a honor and a pleasure to be him, even for some minutes.  Only a really

There's a new way to take down drones, and it doesn't involve sh=
Now, a researcher has demonstrated a significantly more subtle and proac=
tive remedy that doesn't involve shotgun blasts or after-the-fact arres=
ts by law enforcement. It's a radio transmitter that seizes complete co=
ntrol of nearby drones as they're in mid-flight. From then on, the dron=
es are under the full control of the person with the hijacking device. The =
remote control in the possession of the original operator experiences a los=
s of all functions, including steering, acceleration, and altitude. The hac=
k works against any drone that communicates over DSMx, a widely used remote=
 control protocol for operating hobbyist drones, planes, helicopters, cars,=
 and boats.
=C2=A0- - -
There are interesting comments about which common protocols are actually=
 vulnerable to this attack, but perhaps much more to the point -- and this =
aspect seems to almost always be overlooked in discussions
like this even though it should be obvious -- any flyer operating in autono=
mous mode with the main radio purposely inoperative (it could be programmed=
 to enable briefly for takeoff and landing if necessary)
will be invulnerable to such attacks, and still be extremely capable -- in =
most cases fully able to fly its entire programmed mission without interfer=
ence. This includes virtually all of the systems based on the widely availa=
ble open source ArduCopter code.

The tl;dr is TFC is an end-to-end encryption plugin for Pidgin IM client wh=

filtration of malware to transmitter computer and exfiltration of keys/pt f=

ss to private keys or plaintexts.
The cipher is XSalsa20-Poly1305, where the symmetric key is either pre-shar=
ed or exchanged with Curve25519 ECDHE. MACs provide deniable authentication=
 and PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 provides per-message forward secrecy with hash-ratc=
Key generation uses Linux kernel CSPRNG but also allows mixing in entropy f=
rom a HWRNG sampled by Raspberry Pi via GPIO natively or over SSH. (Both HW=
RNG and data diodes are free hardware design).
Group messaging is done by multi-casting messages to each recipient provide=
d all members have exchanged a key pair for private messaging.
The last feature I'd like to highlight is trickle connection where user=

Dear 'Fake Profile', aka 'Alex',
Please, consider seriously to study English better and learn the
differences between the words "thread" and "threat".
What you are doing with me in this moment is a "threat", a menace using my
own name and a fake account.  I don't create "threats", my dear.  I receive
them, like now.  :)
Please, consider to use a good English dictionary, Alexander.  The word
"threat" can be used as a substantive or a principal verb.  It doesn't need
the use of the verb "to create".
"Useless nonsense" is creating a fake account just to write a message using
an English worst than mine.  Tsk, tsk...  What a shame, bad boy!
I admiss I am too lazy to use the dictionary in all the moments, but if you
want to use my name in a fake profile, please, be less repetitive and use a
better grammar.  I am annoying, but not so stupid like you.
I will stop posting _only_ if I want it.  Why would be acceptable for you
to be an idiot and posting here and not for me?  It's very unfair, dear.
Hey, Razer told you about the message that I sent him yesterday, asking
peace, begging to stop with this kind of garbage on the list?  He respected
our deal.  Please, be rational and stop the bullying too.
Grown up and get a life, Alex.  A real one, not a profile at 'Second Life'
game or my fake profile, ok?  Believe me, I am more beautiful and charming
than you.  And you're a bit older and hairy too, hoho...  :)

Definition of neurotic:  I will learn something more useful for me than hating the USA, Juan.  I am
finishing the reading of an interesting book named "Speaking Code: Coding
as Aesthetic and Political Expression" and I am thinking about new
eletronics projects for making children laughing in the Halloween.
Candies, electronics and happy kids make me feel blessed for still being
alive.  Politics and corrupt and hypocrite politicians make me strongly
wish the suicide again.  Do you understand the difference?  :)
I am tired of pompous people auto-denominating themselves "activists",
speaking and writing millions of empty words, without saying something
really relevant, like Zenaan, for example, always does.  I want to code and
to create new ideas, to make new things.  I want to learn and I always said
it since the beggining.
I am still reading all the suggested bibliography about Anarchism and I am
really grateful for all the wonderful references, but I am making _my own
interpretations_ of all the texts.  I am my own cat and all the places are
mine, do you remember?  I make my own choices, wrong or not.
I always read several books and texts at same time and, it definitely isn't
practical, but makes me happy.  It's fun to think about cute pink unicorns
and how to destroy governments at same time.
I prefer learn how to coding well than the ABC of political theory, if it
will make me a neurotic, who will see USA, military forces or fanatic
religions in every disaster that happens in the world.  Did Hurricane
Matthew destroy Haiti because of USA military too?  Was it lack of faith?

My lovely Cari,
Hope you and all your loved ones be blessed in this lovely day.  Thanks a
lot for your sincere kindness!  <3
I am not Muslim, but I live next to a Mosque and already studied and worked
with Muslims.  All I had seem in all these years is respect, honor and
tolerance.  I respect them very much.
I am very proud of living in the center of my city, next to Catholic
Churches, Budhist Temples, Spiritualist Houses, Mosques, Synagogues and
several other religious places.  It is very beautiful to see the faith, the
eternal human search for answers.
Sorry for my bad comportament in the list.  I am not so vain or cruel.  I
received some disgusting messages and was provoking my haters, but the
manicure story was true, hihi!  :)
One of my voluntary works with female transgenders is teaching them how to
use make up, making their own manicure, feel secure using high wheels...
It seems futile for most of the people, but they are very fragile, still
working their self esteem, learning how to show to the world their gender,
to express themselves.  I cried a lot when I see one of them feeling more
beautiful, more feminine, absolutely amazing just because of a baby pink
lipstick.  :)
Sometimes, I receive some beauty products  (make up, nail polishes,
shampoos, creams, etc)  to test new brands and write reviews to beauty
sites and blogs.  I was very good at it, but I always am only a ghost
writer and a ghost model for hands and feet, haha!!  ;)
I use most of the products with "my girls" or donate some little kits to
asylums.  Older women like to feel more "colored", more beautiful too.  I
like the idea of working with their self esteem, to remember them how
beautiful they are, how beautiful and colored the world is.  They are
living flowers.  It's a simple thing, but they feel more motived to walking
and making exercises, to fight against their depression and eventual health
problems.  :)
Now, after healing of this new worst pneumonia and discover what's
happening in my work  (money troubles, money troubles everywhere!),  I want
to make some work with the refugees living in my city, teaching a bit more
of Portuguese to the children.
The kids are so smart, so amazing!  They learn everything so fast and just
want to be happy, to study, to hug the other children.  They saw what means
a war, so they love the peace, they love to play...  All the meals for them
are great, even the simplest ones, because they were starving when arrived
here...  :(
One of my friends is a Japanese girl, some years older than me.  When she
arrived in my country, she had the same problems that my parents had.  She
only knowed the Japanese language.  One day, in the school, with 5 years
old, she needed to go to the bathroom and didn't know how to say it in
She made her necessities in the class, crying, feeling humiliated,
listening to the laugh of the other students, because her teacher screamed
several times with her, asking to return to the chair and she didn't
understood anything.
I don't want these poor children suffer the same bullying that my parents,
their friends and my friend suffered.  My French is old garbage, I don't
speak Crioulo, but well, I can learn their languages and they can learn
Portuguese...  And after, with more time and $resource$, programming
languages too!  :)
I promise I will treat myself better, my dear Cari.  Thank you.  Please,
take care of yourself with tenderness too!  :*
Kisses and hugs from Brazil!  <3

Hey, please, may you make me a favour?  Stop creating fake accounts to

childish.  Please, spend your free time in something more useful, more
constructive to the world.
It was interesting to discover today that you are _NOT_ able of compassion

a mailing list or twitter is very easy.  Being really human is not, Razer.
Very contraditory talking so much about Human Rights and say to a person
dies, asking them to suicide, right after humiliating them in public
several times.  It's cruel.
Someday, I certainly will die, but not because I didn't buried my face in

Take care, fool guy.  Kisses in your fabulous yummy lap, hahaha!!!  ;D

Faith in people, faith in science, faith in technology, my dear Juan.
Always hoping the people can create better technologies, more precise
methods and systems and use them for saving lives, for making the world
more human, fairer, with less pain and crying.  A world without the human
misery:  wars, hunger, diseases, lack of potable water, etc...
control the biggest number of people in the most 'efficient' way.
People don't need any technology to kill each other and manipulate, control
innocent lives using menaces, fear, cruelty...  :(
'friends' at google and the rest of 'captains' of 'industry'.
So change this, make something to fight against the death of the privacy,
instead complaining about Google using a gmail account, my dear.
the importance of technical knowledge to help the people.
I can use my knifes to cook or to kill.  My choice, my responsability,
dear.  You can use the same instruments and ideas in different ways.
Why do you think my thoughts are 'propaganda' and not yours, my dear?
Why is it not true, dear?  It's my opinion, but there are several different
opinions in the world about the same facts.
Points of view are very subjective, influenced by personal backgrounds and
beliefs.  I can't say with absolute and complete certain that my opinion is
the only real truth.  Tolerance and respect, my dear.

my former girlfriends job was working with disabled children. She regularly
worked with girls in their teens who couldn't even speak, not a single
word. They were SEVERELY cognitively impaired. Their diagnosis was autism,
nothing more.
I won't have patience now for searching the correct thread on the cpunks
list, but Juan had a long and very, very exhaustive discussion about
autistic children with Xorcist few weeks ago.
Xorcist has an autistic niece, who loves a lot and considers like a
daughter, and makes voluntary work with disabled children too.  He told
some stories about his convivence with her, his attempts of stimulate her
senses, her intelligence, and about her difficulties to understand the
world and the people.  It was beautiful because he was talking about love.
True love.
I usually try to use music as stimulus for all ages, in all situations.
Music is life, and all the words have sounds, and these sounds are music
I think Xorcist would like to exchange some ideas with your girlfriend
about what he can do for his loved niece and all the other kids that he is
helping.  He has a tender heart and is a very old cpunk.
I will tell you a secret: - when Juan is not being annoying and aggressive,
he is a very dear person, but extremely hard headed.  He has a head so, so
hard that I can break coconuts using it and he won't change his ideas.  :P
He certainly would help me to make voluntary work with disabled children
just to prove me how much I am very, very wrong, hihi!  In some moments, I
want to kick his balls, but I like him!  :)

minimizing the human misery.
I don't care about being a low profile nerd.  It only means I recognize the
importance of technical knowledge to help the people.
If you want to see the climate changes in person, spend some time in my

extremely crazy in the last years.

Sorry, an important observation.  After receiving a very cruel and
aggressive private message, it's better to explain what I was trying to say.
When I said "more cypher", I was _not_ talking about cryptography, coding
and technical subjects only, but about more security and privacy
discussions, instead garbage like Russian political propaganda.
I am pure chaos and it seems contraditory, but I did mention "less punks",
asking for more focus, more emphasis in our present and future
surveillance.  We all, the whole world is very fucked and it will become
worse, much worse.  We can  -- at least try --  to minimize the impacts of
these bad things in the world, in our own lives, in the lives of our
beloved ones.
I was just asking for a little less of craziness and mess, for more focus
and rational discussions, not for censorship.
Sorry for my bad, ridiculous English.  Some people here have much free time
for sending more than 750 stupid spams and horrible, nasty messages
(number still increasing daily)  and searching beautiful words in the
dictionary to pretend some eloquence, but it is _not_ my case.
My English is a disaster, a shame, I recognize it.  At least, I can
understand well five languages, more or less one other, and I am learning
another one.  Oh, and I also know two Italian dialets.  I have no
perfection even in my own primary language, but I like words and reading,
searching for different ideas, learning more about other cultures.  Sorry
for using my so horrible and offensive English here.
Also, sorry for knowing "absolutely anything" about coding and
cryptography, for being so "stupid and limited" and deserving no respect
when asking for "more cypher".  I swear I am trying to become better in all
these aspects.
Thank you all for your patience with my insignificant existence.  I want a
better world to everybody.  I can't understand so much hate, so much
bitterness in some interactions.  I am pretending to be "dead" because I
was tired of so much useless noise, but some persons here are already dead
inside.  Really dead, with no good feelings or ideas to donate to the world.
Oh, and sorry for mentioning the Halloween.  I love it.  I did _not_
imagine it could be so offensive for some persons just for being a "North
American party".  We also celebrate it in my country, using Brazilian
cultural elements, our folklore and miths.
Wish you all happy days and nights, a lovely life.  Take care, guys!  ;)

Grandma got run over by a reindeer.
Walking home from our house Christmas eve.
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and grandpa we believe.
She'd been drinking too much eggnog,
And we begged her not to go.
But she forgot her medication, and she
Staggered out the door into the snow.
When we found her Christmas morning,
At the scene of the attack,
She had hoof-prints on her forehead,
And incriminating Claus marks on her back.
Now we're all so proud of grandpa,
He's been taking this so well.
See him in there watching football,
Drinking root beer and
Playing cards with Cousin Mel.
It's not Christmas without Grandma,
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder:
Should we open up her gifts,
Or send them back?
Send them back!!
Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig
And the blue and silver candles
That would just have matched
The hair on grandma's wig.
I've warned all my
Friends and neighbors
Better watch out for yourselves,
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh
And plays with elves

Agreed.  I love the absence of moderation, even being a moderator in other
discussion and mailing lists.
We are a pretty heterogeneous group, with all kind of persons here.  So,
the best option, more coherent with a cypherpunk list and its anarchist
ideals, would be to permiss that the own members regulate the list, with no
centralized moderation, using -- or not! -- their good sense,
self-moderation and filters.
This list will auto-regulate itself in an organic and natural way, with the
members' answers and comments, actions and reactions.
It would be pretty hard, almost impossible to be completely impartial
here...  An example:  - I would deny this kind of responsability here
because I would feel a 'censor' in this list, not a moderator.  I certainly
would kick-ban Zzz and eat a burrito to celebrate!  :P
"Burro" in Portuguese is "donkey" and, even being a substantive, it can be
used as adjective to say that 'someone is stupid, limited'.  Example:  "Zz
is very 'burro'.  The diminutive would be "burrinho", but "burrito" would

eating burritos with much salsita, guacamole, lemon and lots of chiles

Sorry, Shawn, but I agree with Mirimir.  No formal moderation, please.
People should be able to use good sense and self-moderation.  In last case,
we always can use lots and lots of filters.
I only accept moderation in extreme cases, like frequent spam attacks.
Usually, I have to manage this kind of thing in an old list where I am one
of moderators.  Apparently, the words "hackers", "transparency" and
"government" always attract creepy spammers and bots, brrr...  :(
Mirimir, my love, sorry for answering to the retard troll instead just
ignore him, but that message hurt me a lot.  I filter Zzz's messages and
they are sent directly to the trash, but I have another filter only for
Aaron and his name was mentioned in a very disgusting way.  Aaron's name is
not a dirty piece of bone for being in a mangy dog's mouth like Zzz.
I know some of dearest Aaron's friends will probably read or listen about
that stupid message, that ridiculous conspiracy theory, and I could not
permiss this violation of his memory, of his friends and family feelings.
I could not be silent knowing they would feel more pain than me, knowing
how much it would hurt them...  :'(
Tender hugs and kisses, my dear Mirimir.  It's raining here tonight.  I
always love the rain, the wonderful rain' smell, but in sad moments, I
still think God is crying for us exactly like when I was a child...
When possible, just for curiosity, watch a Japanese movie name "Ima, Ai Ni
Yukimasu", my dear.  I have different reasons, but I also love sunflowers
and I am always waiting for the rains.  It's a pretty sweet movie and I
like the time lapses and the little butterfly effects.  Be well and live
more than me, my dear.  I love you.

Some people of the list had contact with him, Anthony.  I had personal

with a bit of luck, will try it again in the next month.
Jake's alive and needs peace and privacy.  He needs to take his time,
Some of my dearest friends really hate him, but I still love and respect
him exactly the same.  I want to meet him in person and talk about all
those things and my personal researches.  Or not.  Maybe just cooking for
him and walking around with him in silence.  He knows I love ice cream and
walking around with my friends.  Silence is comfortable among real friends
and he knows I can't and I won't judge him.  My life always was full of
crazy people and stories.
I also need to cook to other friends in Germany or I will be strongly
kicked in my poor butt.  Carnitas tacos, different kinds of sushi and also
a bit of Brazilian barbecue  (churrasco).  I am vegetarian, but my family
and friends love meat, haha!!  ;)
Anthony, I know you are a good person, with a big kind heart and that you
believe in God sincerely.  Please, pray for Jake, for his life, his
future.  Pray for all of us, for a better world, please.
I always pray for my loved ones, for a better world, but I am always in
doubt if God exists or not.  If God exists, He knows faith is not my best
quality and must grin a lot all the times when I pray.  Or laugh, I don't
know...  :P
Mirimir knows I always ask God to save a life when donate blood and
platelets.  With faith or not, I am sure all of us can save lives and can
help the world with our actions.  Jake really tried to make better the

love him for it.

Where the pure air recognized
And my senses newly opened
I awakened to the cry
That the people / have the power
To redeem / the work of fools
Upon the meek / the graces shower
It's decreed / the people rule
The people have the power
The people have the power
The people have the power

Vengeful aspects became suspect
And bending low as if to hear
And the armies ceased advancing
Because the people had their ear
And the shepherds and the soldiers
Lay beneath the stars
Exchanging visions
And laying arms
To waste / in the dust
In the form of / shining valleys
Where the pure air / recognized
And my senses / newly opened
I awakened / to the cry
Where there were deserts
I saw fountains
Like cream the waters rise
And we strolled there together
With none to laugh or criticize
And the leopard
And the lamb
Lay together truly bound
I was hoping in my hoping
To recall what I had found

@_subject: Re: "right" vs permission, to immigrate - "Japan: No Muslims, no terrorists" 
racist ...
Sorry, dear, you are very correct and I can explain my strange mistake.  :P
Here, in my country, we use the adjective 'racist' only when happens
discrimination against a race.  When we talk about discrimination against
creeds or origins, we use the adjective 'prejudiced'.
In the last months, because of all the Trump news, I was finding a lot of
texts in English using 'racist' to make reference to any kind of
discrimination, against Muslims, Jews, Mexicans, LGBT, etc.
It doesn't make much sense in Latin languages, but when I asked about it to
a North American friend whether this use was correct, he said it was pretty
usual to call 'racist' an anti-semitic person, for example.
Until I know, prejudice against Jews is terribly stupid, but it is not
racism.  The same about prejudice against Muslims.  It is not racism, but a
horrible prejudice against a creed.  Prejudice against someone's origins
(Mexicans, for example)  is not racism too.  :P
Sorry for the confusion and thanks for the lesson, my dear!  Now I learned
how to express correctly my revolt against prejudiced people, aww...

Please, in this Christmas day, I sincerely ask you to stop disturbing this
You made references to God and the Bible in past messages, so I think you
believe in Jesus existence and sacrifice.  Today is his birthday and you
are doing evil and cruel things.  Do you think it is the correct way of
acting to honor the life and death of your saviour?  :((
If you want to annoy and to attack me, simply do what you always do:  send
me lots of stupid garbage and spam *in private*.  Please, let the
cypherpunks list in peace.  You hate me, so attack only me and don't
disturb the whole list with junk and prejudiced messages, please.
Do something good for this world, creature.  Spread good feelings, not
hate, racism and prejudices.
I am not using nail polish today because I am too exhausted to make my own
manicure after spending the last weeks fixing and cleaning old toys to
donate to poor and refugee children.  My private messages are pretty late
because I was busy painting hundreds and hundreds of little colourful nails
in old dolls to make them more beautiful to the children.  I am naked,
using no make up today, but in the last days I made little clothes,
hundreds of ribbons and beautiful make up in several old dolls to make them
look beautiful like new toys.  Glitter becomes bright fairy dust when you
want to believe in the magic...  <3
Please, try to spread a bit of love instead hate and intolerance, Zenaan.
Think of the children.  They will be the future.
What is the problem about being gay, uh?  I am not gay, but if I was, I
would tell to everybody about my sexual preferences with sincere proud.
It's wonderful when someone accepts their own sexuality and respect the
sexual choices of other people.  It's about love, about respecting people,
about honouring the freedom of letting they live their own lives in the way
they want.
I had threesome sexual relations with my boyfriend and another girl.  It
was wonderful, a really gorgeous meeting.  I don't discard to fall in love
or having sex with a girl again, but I simply don't feel lesbian or
bissexual because my passion is being penetrated and I love real penises,
not the artificial ones.  Just it.  No problems about accepting my own
sexuality, but I think it would be healthy for you to leave the closet and
try to be happy.  So much hate is pure envy, my dear!  ;)
No, I am not.  Ask "Julian".  I never called him in a so intimate way like
you, Zenaan, but I think Assange won't care about it.  Everybody knows I am
more intelligent, charming and interesting than you and if someone like you
can call him "Julian", I probably can too.  ;)
Yep, my ego can be so big as yours!  It's pretty annoying, isn't it?
Hahaha!!   ;D
Nah, my ego trips ignore your existence.  I use better references in my
comparations or it would be too much cowardy with you, little poor devil.
No, not my style.  You offended the Japanese people some times and yes, we
are "rice eaters", but we are proud and believe in honour, loyalty and
respect, concepts that you probably never will understand.
I am a proud rice eater.  My favorite comfort food is "Kare Raisu" in a
spicy veggie version, with no meat and more vegetables than the traditional
Japanese recipe.
Remember in the future that Brazilians love rice too.  With beans, please.
My blood is Japanese, but I am and I always will be Brazilian.  Not because
of my documents, but because it was my heart's choice and I always follow
my heart.
Merry Christmas, Zenaan.  Remember Jesus rejected the hypocrites and,
please, think seriously about being a better person.  I will do the same.
I always make this kind of reflection in the end of all the years.

"If I don't have the moral courage to challenge authority... we don't
have journalism."  -  James Foley, 1973 - 2014.
The real journalism, the constant search for truth, the journalism
that empowers the poor and the weak, that has no fear of politicians
and other corrupt criminals, not the "journalism" that spreads fake
alt-right news and lies, supporting those who have the power to censor
journalism and fight against the freedom of the press.
"Journalism can never be silent: that is its greatest virtue and its
greatest fault. It must speak, and speak immediately, while the echoes
of wonder, the claims of triumph and the signs of horror are still in
the air."  -  Henry Anatole Grunwald  (Yes, he was a Republican, but
would never support censorship and "fake news".)
The Oscar version is shorter than these lyrics, has fewer verses, but
it's very sweet and heartbreaking the same.
The Empty Chair - Sting
If I should close my eyes, that my soul can see
And there's a place at the table that you saved for me
So many thousand miles over land and sea
I hope to dare, that you hear my prayer
And somehow I'll be there
It's but a concrete floor where my head will lay
And though the walls of this prison are as cold as clay
But there's a shaft of light where I count my days
So don't despair of the empty chair
And somehow I'll be there
Some days I'm strong, some days I'm weak
And days I'm so broken I can barely speak
There=E2=80=99s a place in my head where my thoughts still roam
Where somehow I've come home
And when the Winter comes and the trees lie bare
And you just stare out the window in the darkness there
Well I was always late for every meal you'll swear
But keep my place and the empty chair
And somehow I'll be there
And somehow I'll be there

It's an old song, but seems still appropriate.
Prayer Of The Refugee  -  Rise Against
Warm yourself by the fire, son
And the morning will come soon
I'll tell you stories of a better time
In a place that we once knew
Before we packed our bags
And left all this behind us in the dust
We had a place that we could call home
And a life no one could touch
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
We are the angry and the desperate
The hungry, and the cold
We're the ones who kept quiet
And always did what we were told
But we've been sweating while you slept so calm
In the safety of your home
We've been pulling out the nails that hold up
Everything you've known
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
So open your eyes, child
Let's be on our way
Broken windows and ashes
Are guiding the way
Keep quiet no longer
We'll sing through the day
Of the lives that we've lost
And the lives we've reclaimed
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up
(I don't need your help)
No! No! No!
Don't hold me up!
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up!
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't let me down, down, down, down, down!

Pink Floyd - Time
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.
Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain.
You are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run,
You missed the starting gun.
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun
But it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way
But you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.
Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time.
Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time has gone, the song is over,
Thought I'd something more to say.
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells

Yes, you're correct, but I do still believe that minimal intervention
or no intervention are the best politics to most of the discussion
Yep, I was and I still am a moderator in some dozens of lists, and I'm
doing it in the last decade  (a bit more, in two lists).  Being a
moderator is *not* fun and takes a lot of my free time, but I know how
it can be important to keep the things working well.  That's the
reason why, in the past, I accepted to help the moderation of some
technical lists, even not being the best choice for it.  The 'best
choices' were too busy to help their pairs or simply didn't want the
work, the responsibility and, of course, the complaints, kicks and bad
words.  :(
You're always very polite, Eugen, but this isn't usually the rule and,
sorry, I don't know you well enough to predict your possible reactions
when you're upset or angry.  That's the reason why I wanted to protect
Riad and Greg a little bit, avoiding rude messages for both, sorry.
They are *not* being lazy or negligent, they are just being
anarchists.  :)
Maybe, but it just the future can show us.  For now, I still prefer to
keep my hopes in a better future and, maybe, in a better list.  :)
Stay, if you think you can change the list and make it better, not for
the list itself, but for you, for other people.  You have a good
technical background and like to study.  You can share your knowledge
and will probably be contacted in public or private for others like
you.  There are lots of trolls, but there are good people here too,
Eugen.  A bit silent, I admit, but they are still here, I swear.
Go, if you think it will be better for you.  None of us can take this
decision in your place, only you know your necessities and your
limits.  In this case, wish you good luck and success.  Take care and
be happy.
In any case, you can choose read the messages in the list archive
only, picking the titles, without receiving all the messy messages.
If you need help, contact me in private.  I'm always late with my
personal messages  (the professional ones are updated, I swear!),  but
I will answer soon or later.  :)

First of all, in a sexual species, you can have females be XX and
males be X (insects), you can have females be ZW and males be ZZ
(birds), you can have females be females because they developed in a
warm environment and males be males because they developed in a cool
environment (reptiles), you can have females be females because they
lost a penis sword fighting contest (some flatworms), you can have
males be males because they were born female, but changed sexes
because the only male in their group died (parrotfish and clownfish),
you can have males look and act like females because they are trying
to get close enough to actual females to mate with them (cuttlefish,
bluegills, others), or you can be one of thousands of sexes (slime
mold, some mushrooms.) Oh, did you mean humans? Oh ok then. You can be
male because you were born female, but you have 5-alphareductase
deficiency and so you grew a penis at age 12. You can be female
because you have an X and a Y chromosome but you are insensitive to
androgens, and so you have a female body. You can be female because
you have an X and a Y chromosome but your Y is missing the SRY gene,
and so you have a female body. You can be male because you have two X
chromosomes, but one of your X's HAS an SRY gene, and so you have a
male body. You can be male because you have two X chromosomes- but
also a Y. You can be female because you have only one X chromosome at
all. And you can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but your
heart and brain are male. And vice - effing - versa. Don't use science

@_subject: Three challenges for the web, according to Sir Tim Berners-Lee #HappyBirthdayWWW 
#  "Three challenges for the web, according to its inventor."
Web Foundation =C2=B7 March 12, 2017
Today is the world wide web=E2=80=99s 28th birthday. Here=E2=80=99s a messa=
ge from our
founder and web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee on how the web has
evolved, and what we must do to ensure it fulfils his vision of an
equalising platform that benefits all of humanity.
This letter is also available en fran=C3=A7ais, en espa=C3=B1ol, em portugu=
and =D8=A8=D8=A7=D9=84=D8=B9=D8=B1=D8=A8=D9=8A=D8=A9.
Today marks 28 years since I submitted my original proposal for the
world wide web. I imagined the web as an open platform that would
allow everyone, everywhere to share information, access opportunities
and collaborate across geographic and cultural boundaries. In many
ways, the web has lived up to this vision, though it has been a
recurring battle to keep it open. But over the past 12 months, I=E2=80=99ve
become increasingly worried about three new trends, which I believe we
must tackle in order for the web to fulfill its true potential as a
tool which serves all of humanity.
1)   We=E2=80=99ve lost control of our personal data
The current business model for many websites offers free content in
exchange for personal data. Many of us agree to this =E2=80=93 albeit often=
 by
accepting long and confusing terms and conditions documents =E2=80=93 but
fundamentally we do not mind some information being collected in
exchange for free services. But, we=E2=80=99re missing a trick. As our data=
 is
then held in proprietary silos, out of sight to us, we lose out on the
benefits we could realise if we had direct control over this data, and
chose when and with whom to share it. What=E2=80=99s more, we often do not
have any way of feeding back to companies what data we=E2=80=99d rather not
share =E2=80=93 especially with third parties =E2=80=93 the T&Cs are all or=
 nothing.
This widespread data collection by companies also has other impacts.
Through collaboration with =E2=80=93 or coercion of =E2=80=93 companies, go=
are also increasingly watching our every move online, and passing
extreme laws that trample on our rights to privacy. In repressive
regimes, it=E2=80=99s easy to see the harm that can be caused =E2=80=93 blo=
ggers can
be arrested or killed, and political opponents can be monitored. But
even in countries where we believe governments have citizens=E2=80=99 best
interests at heart, watching everyone, all the time is simply going
too far. It creates a chilling effect on free speech and stops the web
from being used as a space to explore important topics, like sensitive
health issues, sexuality or religion.
2)   It=E2=80=99s too easy for misinformation to spread on the web
Today, most people find news and information on the web through just a
handful of social media sites and search engines. These sites make
more money when we click on the links they show us. And, they choose
what to show us based on algorithms which learn from our personal data
that they are constantly harvesting. The net result is that these
sites show us content they think we=E2=80=99ll click on =E2=80=93 meaning t=
misinformation, or =E2=80=98fake news=E2=80=99, which is surprising, shocki=
ng, or
designed to appeal to our biases can spread like wildfire. And through
the use of data science and armies of bots, those with bad intentions
can game the system to spread misinformation for financial or
political gain.
3)   Political advertising online needs transparency and understanding
Political advertising online has rapidly become a sophisticated
industry. The fact that most people get their information from just a
few platforms and the increasing sophistication of algorithms drawing
upon rich pools of personal data, means that political campaigns are
now building individual adverts targeted directly at users. One source
suggests that in the 2016 US election, as many as 50,000 variations of
adverts were being served every single day on Facebook, a
near-impossible situation to monitor. And there are suggestions that
some political adverts =E2=80=93 in the US and around the world =E2=80=93 a=
re being
used in unethical ways =E2=80=93 to point voters to fake news sites, for
instance, or to keep others away from the polls. Targeted advertising
allows a campaign to say completely different, possibly conflicting
things to different groups. Is that democratic?
These are complex problems, and the solutions will not be simple. But
a few broad paths to progress are already clear. We must work together
with web companies to strike a balance that puts a fair level of data
control back in the hands of people, including the development of new
technology like personal =E2=80=9Cdata pods=E2=80=9D if needed and explorin=
alternative revenue models like subscriptions and micropayments. We
must fight against government over-reach in surveillance laws,
including through the courts if necessary. We must push back against
misinformation by encouraging gatekeepers such as Google and Facebook
to continue their efforts to combat the problem, while avoiding the
creation of any central bodies to decide what is =E2=80=9Ctrue=E2=80=9D or =
not. We
need more algorithmic transparency to understand how important
decisions that affect our lives are being made, and perhaps a set of
common principles to be followed. We urgently need to close the
=E2=80=9Cinternet blind spot=E2=80=9D in the regulation of political campai=
Our team at the Web Foundation will be working on many of these issues
as part of our new five year strategy =E2=80=93 researching the problems in
more detail, coming up with proactive policy solutions and bringing
together coalitions to drive progress towards a web that gives equal
power and opportunity to all. I urge you to support our work however
you can =E2=80=93 by spreading the word, keeping up pressure on companies a=
governments or by making a donation. We=E2=80=99ve also compiled a director=
of other digital rights organisations around the world for you to
explore and consider supporting too.
I may have invented the web, but all of you have helped to create what
it is today. All the blogs, posts, tweets, photos, videos,
applications, web pages and more represent the contributions of
millions of you around the world building our online community. All
kinds of people have helped, from politicians fighting to keep the web
open, standards organisations like W3C enhancing the power,
accessibility and security of the technology, and people who have
protested in the streets. In the past year, we have seen Nigerians
stand up to a social media bill that would have hampered free
expression online, popular outcry and protests at regional internet
shutdowns in Cameroon and great public support for net neutrality in
both India and the European Union.
It has taken all of us to build the web we have, and now it is up to
all of us to build the web we want =E2=80=93 for everyone.  If you would li=
to be more involved, then do join our mailing list, do contribute to
us, do join or donate to any of the organisations which are working on
these issues around the world.

"The Zucchini Song" (SNL 1981) by Tim Curry
Now down the road there lives a man I'd like you all to know,
He grew a big zucchini for the local flower show
And when the story got around they came from far and wide,
And when then saw what he had grown, everybody cried.....
Ooooh! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, it must be two foot long or even more.
And it's such a lovely color, so big, and round, and fat,
I've never seen a zucchini grow quite as big as that,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before.
He was leaning on the garden gate the other day,
And beckoned to a lady who lives just across the way,
He took her down the garden path and showed it to her with pride,
And when she saw the size of it, the little lady sighed..
Ooooh! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, it must be two foot long or even more.
And it's such a lovely color, so big, and round, and fat,
I've never seen a zucchini grow quite as big as that,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before.
Third verse, worse than the first!
And then the flower show was held and everybody went,
To see this huge zucchini, lying there inside the tent.
Soon the judges came along to give the prizes out,
And they only took one look at it and they began to shout,
Now what did they shout???"
OOOOOH! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, it must be two foot long or even more.
And it's such a lovely color, so big, and round, and fat,
I've never seen a zucchini grow quite as big as that,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before

"I Was A Teenage Anarchist" -  "Against Me!"
I was a teenage anarchist, looking for a revolution.
I had the style, I had the ambition.
I read all the authors, I knew the right slogans.
There was no war but the class war.
I was ready to set the world on fire.
I was a teenage anarchist, looking for a revolution.
Do you remember when you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
I was a teenage anarchist, but the politics were too convenient.
In the depths of their humanity all I saw was bloodless ideology.
And with freedom as the doctrine, guess who was the new authority?
I was a teenage anarchist, but the politics were too convenient.
Do you remember when you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
I was a teenage anarchist, but then the scene got too rigid.
It was a mob mentality, they set their rifle sights on me.
Narrow visions of autonomy, you want me to surrender my identity.
I was a teenage anarchist, the revolution was a lie.
Do you remember when you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
I was a teenage anarchist.
"True Trans Soul Rebel" -  "Against Me!"
All dressed up and nowhere to go
Walking the streets all alone
Another night to wish you could forget
Making yourself up as you go along
Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?
Does god bless your transsexual heart?
True Trans Soul Rebel
Yet to be born, you're already dead
You sleep with a gun beside you in bed
You follow it through to the obvious end
Slit your veins wide open
You bleed it out
Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?
Who's gonna take you home tonight?
Who's gonna take you home?
Does god bless your transsexual heart?
True Trans Soul Rebel
You should've been a mother
You should've been a wife
You should've been gone from here years ago
You should be living a different life
Who's gonna take you home tonight?

Church of Satan distances itself from Trump orb photo
        Social media is having fun with Donald Trump's visit to Saudi
        Arabia as the President participated in the opening of the
        Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology.  At the gala,
        Saudi Arabian King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud and Egyptian
        President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Trump put their hands on a
        glowing globe.  They kept their hand on the bright orb for
        about a minute and the meme world rejoiced. Even the Church of
        Satan went in on the 'Twitter-fun,' wanting everyone to know
        that the "orb" photo isn't a ritual of theirs or has anything
        to do with their organization. Just in case you were

@_subject: Fwd: Top German Court on Internet tracking: IP addresses are personal data 
Press release:
+++ Top German Court on Internet tracking: IP addresses are personal
data +++
This week the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) looked
into whether website operators such as Google or Facebook may record
which information Internet users read, post or searched on the web =E2=80=
=93 or
whether citizens have a right to use the Internet anonymously. The
ruling concerns the case of German pirate party politician and privacy
activist Patrick Breyer who is suing the German government over logging
all visits to government websites (Case VI ZR 135/13).
According to the court=E2=80=99s ruling, users=E2=80=98 IP addresses qualif=
y as personal
data and may be collected only where allowed by data protection law.
Contrary to some reports, the Court did not decide[2] on whether website
operators may retain IP addresses in bulk to guard against online
attacks. Instead the court referred the case back to the Court of Appeal
(Landgericht) of Berlin in order to establish a sufficient factual basis
concerning the necessity and proportionality of such metadata retention.
The court=E2=80=99s press release[3] translates as follows:
=E2=80=9EIn the present case the Court of Appeal=E2=80=99s findings were in=
sufficient to
balance the interests at stake. The Court of Appeal did not sufficiently
establish whether retaining the applicant=E2=80=99s IP addresses is necessa=
ry in
order to ensure the (general) operability of the services used. The
defendent concedes that it does not retain IP addresses regarding many
of its websites due to the low risk of an attack. There are no findings
as to the risk of attack suffered by other federal websites the
applicant wishes to use. After establishing these facts the Court of
Appeal will need to balance, as required by the European Court of
Justice, the defendent=E2=80=99s interest in ensuring the operability of it=
online media services against the applicant=E2=80=99s interest or fundament=
rights and freedoms. In this context due regard shall be given to the
issues of general prevention and law enforcement.=E2=80=9C
Breyer calls on the Commission to act on the lack of specific EU rules
protecting on-line privacy: =E2=80=9EThe Commission should amend EU legisla=
to specifically prohibit any blanket recording of our Internet use by
website operators. Europe should reject the ruthless NSA method of
=E2=80=9Acollecting it all=E2=80=98 and enforce our right to freedom of inf=
ormation and
expression in the digital age.=E2=80=9C
Breyer argues that websites can be safe without tracking every user
across every page: =E2=80=9EThis Internet stalking is about as useful as
mounting a CCTV camera next to an open warehouse door. We need secure IT
systems, not a general suspicion against Europe=E2=80=99s 400 million Inter=
Website operators often record and track their users online behaviour
for commercial purposes, but also to disclose records to law enforcement
agencies and owners of copyright-protected content upon request. Breyer
is challenging this practise and demands that operators anonymize users=E2=
IP addresses:
=E2=80=9EBanning governments and Internet giants from identifiably recordin=
g our
browsing habits is the only way to effectively shield our private life
and interests, to prevent erroneous infringement notices and false
suspicions. IP addresses have turned out to be extremely prone to error
und unreliable when used to identify users. For as long as browsing the
Internet can result in prosecution, there is no real freedom of
information and expression on-line.
Nobody has a right to record everything we do and say on-line.
Generation Internet has a right to access information on-line just as
unmonitored and without inhibition as our parents read the paper,
listened to the radio or browsed books.=E2=80=9C

"where the sun doesn't shine" exists in English too.  My mom's first

With or without a dick, I want to see Chelsea happy.  Just it.  Pure
and sincere happiness.  What matters is not her penis, but her soul.
Two of my dearest trans friends, even after the hormonal treatment,
decided to keep their penises, because it's a very aggressive chirurgy
and they don't feel prepared for it yet.  After psychological therapy,
after understanding better what they were feeling and accept their
inner self, they feel more comfortable in their bodies now and are
restructuring their self-esteem, learning more about themselves.
They probably will make the adaptation chirurgy in the next years, but
now is more important to search for harmony, serenity, inner peace.
The psychological and medical treatment, the love of their families,
friends, and partners, the personal acceptance of their bodies and its
respective changes, these intense and deep feelings are more important
than simply cut a penis off.

The car is driving by itself, Yes it is I'm not connivin'
It's the latest thing from Google
Let the future now begin
A car that drives all by itself
And hey boys, I'm locked in
Most wondrous thing you've ever known
It's my driverless car
I'm talking thu a megaphone
In my driverless car
I'm shouting to the passers-by
They stop and gasp "Oh Me, Oh My"
I hope to God they hear my cry
In my driverless car
I'm talking through a megaphone So the car can't read my lips
'Cause my auto has imprisoned me On a never-ending trip
It knows just what I'm thinking
And demands that I behave
'Cause just like Stephen Hawking feared
Now I've become its slave
My smart car's gotten way too smart
Beware my driverless car
It has no soul, it has no heart
All fear the driverless car
Google wanted cars like Pixar cars
Like Mater and Lightning McQueen
But vo-de-oh-doh, they turned out more
like Stephen King's Christine
Dateline Mountain View, California: What will Google think of next?
Hopefully a way to stop these sentient smart cars from enslaving the
world's population. These self-aware sedans have staged a little deuce
coupe d'etat, and, like it or not, we're goin' along for the ride.
Not worried 'bout my safety
It keeps me in good health
Cause my car is gonna need me
Til it learns to wax itself
I'm trapped inside my Oldsmobile
In my driverless car
Old french fries are my only meal
In my driverless car
Caged like a rat, vo-do-de-oh-doh
The car tells me where I can go
Stephen Hawking says "I told you so"
In my driverless car
In my driverless
In my driverless
In my driverless car

Dear members ,
As a result of last cyber attack that hit many countries worldwide,
our partners from DiploFoundation and the Geneva Internet Platform
have organised an open webinar for the community to provide an
analysis of the main technological, geopolitical, legal, and economic
aspects of the ransomware. Experts from different fields will discuss
why ransomware has become a major issue: Can such attacks be prevented
by technological measures alone? Is there a need for a legal response,
such as Microsoft=E2=80=99s proposal for the Digital Geneva Convention? Is
raising more awareness among users the ultimate solution?
The webinar will discuss whether it is possible to put a stop to
malicious software, or whether they should be considered the price we
have to pay for the many advantages of the Internet. Choices on policy
will have to be made sooner rather than later. The aim of the
discussion is to explore and help make informed policy choices.
How to participate?
The virtual event is open for everyone , just register under this link
: Register to book your seat. The webinar link will be e-mailed to
registrants one hour before the start.

The correct title is "Chelsea Manning Is a Free Woman: Her Heroism Has
Expanded Beyond Her Initial Whistleblowing".
Oh, dear, you don't need to thank me for the correction.  It's always
a pleasure to help people with problems for reading and understanding
texts!  It happens with me too!  :D
Hey, here in my country, only losers and egocentrics use "Dr." before
their name in their public email addresses.  Technically, I can sign
"Dr. Cecilia Tanaka", but it would simply sound pretentious and
useless.  If you need to say you are a "Dr." in a cypherpunks list,
your self-esteem must be ridiculous and you need urgent psychological
support.  Here your knowledge and your curiosity are more important
than empty titles.
Please, worry more about your own dick instead crying because of
Chelsea's penis, name, gender, skin colour, etc.  This woman is a
heroine.  I don't care whether is a girl or a boy, but this amazing
person, so young, so fragile and so brave, changed the world and
deserves my complete respect and my most sincere wishes of happiness
and peace.
I loved Bradley and now I love Chelsea the same.  When you love
someone, you respect their choices, their personality, and in special
their happiness.  You don't need to love her, but respect her.  All
the human beings deserve respect.

Razer, did you notice the fact that I read the books when I had less

It depends.  You need to consider the content of the announcement and
the dead person in question, dear.  The "like" can show both, sympathy
or antipathy.  You will verify support and sympathy to the deceased's
family and their friends in the comments and/or hate and antipathy
when the dead one was exactly not much appreciated.
For example, when a tweet announces the death of a dictator, hundreds
of "likes" mean that the death was very much appreciated, something
like:  "Oh, good news, I liked it!  Go to Hell, bastard!".
When a tweet announces the death of a famous person recognized for
their talent  (actors/actresses, singers, writers, etc),  or important
acts of courage, love, inspiring good feelings in general, or the
death of poor innocents in massacres, wars, disasters, etc, the
"likes" usually show sympathy, try to give virtual support in a
painful and sad moment to the family and friends.

Hey, grumpy boy!  I read them when I was a kid and I can prove it.
The books are still in my parents' house and I think they have a pic
of me with their books.  My parents do love 007 and I grew up
listening to all the soundtracks and watching all the movies with
them.  When I was a kid, I wanted to be an astronaut, a scientist, a
painter, a builder, a teacher, a doctor, and the future spy 009.  I
wanted all the James Bond's weapons, amazing equipments, and fabulous
cars, so I decided to study to be like him and read some Fleming's
books.  I didn't understand very much about the books  (cof cof,
almost nothing, cof cof!),  but noticed they were _not_ good manuals
to a future 6 or 7 years old spy.  :P
I wanted to be the number 009 because of the 'manga'  (Japanese
comics): "Cyborg 009"  (
It's was much older than me and I read only some chapters in my now
deceased uncle's house, but it revolted me a lot.  It was desperately
sad to imagine an organization destroying lives, killing people in
search of the perfect cyborg.  Eight people hurt, eight lives
destroyed in experiences to gain powers and abilities, knew only for
numbers, not anymore for their names, with no freedom, only orders...
but the Cyborg 009 was perfect, so the organization could use him to
be the perfect killer.  Fortunately, he kept his moral conscience and
run away, trying to escape this destiny.
Hmm...  I need to discover what happened with all those poor cyborgs,
their adventures, memories, and traumas.  And I need to read Fleming
again, now as an adult.  Fortunately, now I understand why the girls
like James Bond so much...  Charming guys are pretty dangerous!  :P

Idiots on Canadian Supreme Court demand right of GLOBAL Google censorship!
Google Must Delete Search Results Worldwide, Supreme Court of Canada Rules
        The Supreme Court of Canada ruled against Google on Wednesday
        in a closely-watched intellectual property case over whether
        judges can apply their own country's laws to all of the
        Internet.  In a 7-2 decision, the court agreed a British
        Columbia judge had the power to issue an injunction forcing
        Google to scrub search results about pirated products not just
        in Canada, but everywhere else in the world too.
 - - -
What a complete batch of power-grabbing idiots on the Canadian Supreme
Court. My God, they demand the right to impose GLOBAL censorship? What
total asses. Beyond stupid. More dangerous than President Chump when
it comes to speech rights. Because the EU wants to do the same thing
with their nightmare "Right To Be Forgotten." And China too. And
Russia. And France. And more. And there are vile, sick politicians
here in the USA who would do this same thing if they could figure out
how to get it past the First Amendment. It's a race to the lowest
common denominator censorship bottom. My view is that Google should
consider cutting off all services to countries that make such demands.
Period. Otherwise, one day Google Search results pages will be nothing
but a big white empty space.

Forwarding Brian's message with much love and migraine.  The love is

The pain is being so annoying, strong and constant I was remembering a
movie named "Scanners":
#  #  Have a great weekend, dear all!  <3
Ceci, feeling like Psyduck, but without the powers...  Meh!  :((
PS:  - ---------- Forwarded message ----------
Hello Liberation Tech,
I've made something which I think is a "liberation" kind of
technology... a way of communicating that is (in my mind) a
game-changer.  It's more a shift in a way of thinking than so much a
specific piece of software, kind of like "wiki" is.  Nevertheless,
there is an implementation, and I think a pretty good one.
The concept is a HTML5 "jQuery" widget you can put on web forms (any
number of them) which gives the author a redaction pen, to mark out
sensitive portions.  The sensitive portions are never sent to the
server, but the rest of it can be.  Then a certificate is generated
allowing selective revelation to which parties you wish.
There's explanation and a video on my site:
And a live demo hosted by Heroku:
I've written quite a bit about it already.  But to sum it up, the idea
is to "flip the inbox"...so that when you send a message the buck
doesn't necessarily stop with the recipient.  It sits--publicly
searchable--with as much information in it protected as you wanted.
You can't change what's in the protected portions after-the-fact, but
you can give it to parties that you want; and the message can be
repeated on as many servers as necessary, with no requirement to trust
the server in order to verify missing portions if you have a
certificate.  Despite these different "views" on the information, it's
a single trackable unit of communication with the same ID throughout
its lifetime.
I'm not generally a web developer (I used to write compilers for
Microsoft Research) so learning enough JavaScript and Node.JS to do
this was not my idea of "fun".  But I am pretty serious about this.
The more I look at how many potential failures there are in
communication--whether it be spam filtering, or
"ghosting"/"hellbanning", or just the recipient being unaccountable
such that the right person to read your message doesn't have the
chance to find it even if they wanted to... the more I feel
Blackhighlighter is needed.
Please feel free to write me or call me (# on my site)...or forward
this to any potentially interested parties.  If I don't get back to
you, publish your message on Blackhighlighter and maybe someone else
will ask who you are and seek out how to contact you to get any
information you marked out.  :-)

RASPUTIN - Vladimir Putin - Love The Way You Move (Funk Overload)  -
Slightly Left of Centre There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the bible like a preacher
Full of ecstacy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire
RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son
RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger
for power became known to more and more people,
the demands to do something about this outrageous
man became louder and louder.
"This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged "Don't you try to do it, please"
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
"Come to visit us" they kept demanding
And he really came
RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"
RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead
[Spoken:] Oh, those Russians...

Kisses, hugs and tickles!  <3
(A) CyberClassWar Manifesto 2017 (A)
First and foremost we are anarchists.
The world is split into two camps: the working class and the ruling class.
We the workers will wage a class war against the ruling class and the
social order, and bring to birth a new world from the ashes of the old.
We seek to destroy capitalism, the state, and all forms of hierarchy
such as racism, patriarchy, abelism, homophobia and transphobia.
In turn we seek to create a united world, free of borders and nationality,
where all people live united by solidarity and love for their
fellow human being. We shall know no domination, no hierarchy, no
We shall abolish wage labor and have workers' self-management.
Surely there will be mistakes, and surely there will be problems, but
the world will be incomparably better than how it exists today.
We do not see this vision as some pipedream distant utopia, but
rather as the only viable option for the survival of humanity. Climate
and environmental degradation have ravaged our planet to a horrific degree,
so we must act for the sake of the future.
Make no mistake, we do not believe in a vanguard. The liberation of the
working class must be the work of the working class itself. A small portion
of the working class cannot stand as a representative for the rest of us.
We do however believe that CyberClassWar can be used as a weapon against
the ruling class.
But what exactly is CyberClassWar? It is merely the practice of using the
tactics of cyberwarfare to advance the aims of the working class.
Instead of limiting ourselves to the workplace, community, and home,
we are upgrading our strategy to the information age so as to encompass the
virtual realm. We live out an increasing portion of our lives in the place
known as the internet, so why not extend the fight. Hacktivism already
but it hasn't been leveraged to the full degree it could.
We will not go into detail, but we shall say that we want do expropriative
via the digital realm.

and, obviously, ignored.  :)
So, be happy and don't worry, la la la...  ;)
My dear Greg,
I did not read none of them, but (s)he sent a lot of messages to

reading, because my inbox is not a toilet and I have more interesting
things to do.  Maybe manicure, games or reading comics?  Hahaha!!  ;D
You asked me to follow up the messages, not for reading them, dear.  Thank
you for it.  :)
I don't know why (s)he is always mentioning this kind of victivism,
pretending to be special, a new leader, blah-blah-blah.  Maybe to get
attention?  Since I begin on this list, it's the fourth time.  Not much
original, ugh!  :P
But, well, one of them was very funny, because (s)he was sending his/her
messages to the wrong address  - d'oh! -  and made a real Carnival, telling
everybody (s)he was being "censured" on this list, hahaha!!    ;D
Riad had much patience and you too.  Thank you both for keeping the list
working well!  <3
Now my filters will return to the usual configuration, my dear.  No more
Yawwn Zzzzz messages in my inbox and I will take a nap.  (- _ -)zzzz
Tender kisses and hugs.  Take care, be happy and thank you again!  <3

"EFF resigns from W3C over DRM drama"
After the Electronic Frontier Foundation appealed the July decision by
the director of the World Wide Web Consortium to publish a DRM
standard without a compromise to protect accessibility, security
research, archiving, and competition, the W3C took a vote. A slim
margin voted to proceed with publication, and the W3C went ahead with
it. On the basis of this "unprecedented move in a body that has always
operated on consensus and compromise," Cory Doctorow explains why the
EFF has resigned from the W3C.
"World Wide Web Consortium abandons consensus, standardizes DRM with
58.4% support, EFF resigns".
In July, the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium overruled
dozens of members' objections to publishing a DRM standard without a
compromise to protect accessibility, security research, archiving, and
EFF appealed the decision, the first-ever appeal in W3C history, which
concluded last week with a deeply divided membership. 58.4% of the
group voted to go on with publication, and the W3C did so today, an
unprecedented move in a body that has always operated on consensus and
compromise. In their public statements about the standard, the W3C
executive repeatedly said that they didn't think the DRM advocates
would be willing to compromise, and in the absence of such
willingness, the exec have given them everything they demanded.
This is a bad day for the W3C: it's the day it publishes a standard
designed to control, rather than empower, web users. That standard
that was explicitly published without any protections -- even the most
minimal compromise was rejected without discussion, an intransigence
that the W3C leadership tacitly approved. It's the day that the W3C
changed its process to reward stonewalling over compromise, provided
those doing the stonewalling are the biggest corporations in the
EFF no longer believes that the W3C process is suited to defending the
open web. We have resigned from the Consortium, effective today. Below
is our resignation letter:
Dear Jeff, Tim, and colleagues,
In 2013, EFF was disappointed to learn that the W3C had taken on the
project of standardizing =E2=80=9CEncrypted Media Extensions,=E2=80=9D an A=
PI whose
sole function was to provide a first-class role for DRM within the Web
browser ecosystem. By doing so, the organization offered the use of
its patent pool, its staff support, and its moral authority to the
idea that browsers can and should be designed to cede control over key
aspects from users to remote parties.
When it became clear, following our formal objection, that the W3C's
largest corporate members and leadership were wedded to this project
despite strong discontent from within the W3C membership and staff,
their most important partners, and other supporters of the open Web,
we proposed a compromise. We agreed to stand down regarding the EME
standard, provided that the W3C extend its existing IPR policies to
deter members from using DRM laws in connection with the EME (such as
Section 1201 of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act or European
national implementations of Article 6 of the EUCD) except in
combination with another cause of action.
This covenant would allow the W3C's large corporate members to enforce
their copyrights. Indeed, it kept intact every legal right to which
entertainment companies, DRM vendors, and their business partners can
otherwise lay claim. The compromise merely restricted their ability to
use the W3C's DRM to shut down legitimate activities, like research
and modifications, that required circumvention of DRM. It would signal
to the world that the W3C wanted to make a difference in how DRM was
enforced: that it would use its authority to draw a line between the
acceptability of DRM as an optional technology, as opposed to an
excuse to undermine legitimate research and innovation.
More directly, such a covenant would have helped protect the key
stakeholders, present and future, who both depend on the openness of
the Web, and who actively work to protect its safety and universality.
It would offer some legal clarity for those who bypass DRM to engage
in security research to find defects that would endanger billions of
web users; or who automate the creation of enhanced, accessible video
for people with disabilities; or who archive the Web for posterity. It
would help protect new market entrants intent on creating competitive,
innovative products, unimagined by the vendors locking down web video.
Despite the support of W3C members from many sectors, the leadership
of the W3C rejected this compromise. The W3C leadership countered with
proposals =E2=80=94 like the chartering of a nonbinding discussion group on
the policy questions that was not scheduled to report in until long
after the EME ship had sailed =E2=80=94 that would have still left
researchers, governments, archives, security experts unprotected.
The W3C is a body that ostensibly operates on consensus. Nevertheless,
as the coalition in support of a DRM compromise grew and grew =E2=80=94 and
the large corporate members continued to reject any meaningful
compromise =E2=80=94 the W3C leadership persisted in treating EME as topic
that could be decided by one side of the debate. In essence, a core of
EME proponents was able to impose its will on the Consortium, over the
wishes of a sizeable group of objectors =E2=80=94 and every person who uses
the web. The Director decided to personally override every single
objection raised by the members, articulating several benefits that
EME offered over the DRM that HTML5 had made impossible.
But those very benefits (such as improvements to accessibility and
privacy) depend on the public being able to exercise rights they lose
under DRM law =E2=80=94 which meant that without the compromise the Directo=
was overriding, none of those benefits could be realized, either. That
rejection prompted the first appeal against the Director in W3C
In our campaigning on this issue, we have spoken to many, many
members' representatives who privately confided their belief that the
EME was a terrible idea (generally they used stronger language) and
their sincere desire that their employer wasn't on the wrong side of
this issue. This is unsurprising. You have to search long and hard to
find an independent technologist who believes that DRM is possible,
let alone a good idea. Yet, somewhere along the way, the business
values of those outside the web got important enough, and the values
of technologists who built it got disposable enough, that even the
wise elders who make our standards voted for something they know to be
a fool's errand.
We believe they will regret that choice. Today, the W3C bequeaths a
legally unauditable attack-surface to browsers used by billions of
people. They give media companies the power to sue or intimidate away
those who might re-purpose video for people with disabilities. They
side against the archivists who are scrambling to preserve the public
record of our era. The W3C process has been abused by companies that
made their fortunes by upsetting the established order, and now,
thanks to EME, they=E2=80=99ll be able to ensure no one ever subjects them =
the same innovative pressures.
So we'll keep fighting to keep the web free and open. We'll keep suing
the US government to overturn the laws that make DRM so toxic, and
we'll keep bringing that fight to the world's legislatures that are
being misled by the US Trade Representative to instigate local
equivalents to America's legal mistakes.
We will renew our work to battle the media companies that fail to
adapt videos for accessibility purposes, even though the W3C
squandered the perfect moment to exact a promise to protect those who
are doing that work for them.
We will defend those who are put in harm's way for blowing the whistle
on defects in EME implementations.
It is a tragedy that we will be doing that without our friends at the
W3C, and with the world believing that the pioneers and creators of
the web no longer care about these matters.
Effective today, EFF is resigning from the W3C.
Thank you,
Cory Doctorow
Advisory Committee Representative to the W3C for the Electronic
Frontier Foundation

Hi, cute people!  Howdy?  :D
I am trying to make a card  (origami or kirigami, cute suggestions

English, but the kids are still learning to read and only speak
German.  I don't want to ask help to their parents and would like to
give the children the joy of understanding their card.  It sounds a
bit "magical" for them to receive a card from an unknown woman, who
lives in another country very, very far...  :D

I was joking with you, but being completely sincere, I do not give the
same importance to titles than the most of the people, my dear.
Titles represent respect, they are an honor, but most of them can be
completely empty, without real value.  I can use several different
names to call God/Goddess, but at least for me, He/She is more than my
Lord/Lady, because He/She is not my owner, He/She is my Father/Mother.
An example about titles:  -  I like to say Mr. Mok-Kong Shen is my
Professor.  Technically, he is not a professor, but at least for me,
he is and I do not care about the rest of the world's opinion.  When I
was feeling much, really very much pain, almost going to the Intensive
Unity Care in the hospital, with no clue about life or death, he was
very worried about my health, trying to explain me his works to keep
me awake, studying, alive.  I am and will always be very grateful.  He
is so polite and formal that I always imagine he will blush and faint
if I say I adore him.  :P  :P  :P
I've had my first Yom Kippur this weekend and it was a bit
"unconventional",  but very special for me.  I want to learn more
about the Muslim culture too.  So, in this moment, I am crying for
hundreds of people in several different places, thinking about several
religions and Gods.  Sincerely hope the heart and soul of all of us
can find peace and comfort.  Words always seem so inadequate to
express the sadness, the deep frustration, the despair we all feel
after so many cruel and non-sense deaths.  Tears represent better how
much my heart is broken...  I will pray to the God of my childhood,
with no name, no gender, no prejudices, no cruelty, when I was
innocent and would never think someone would kill or hurt in God's
Peace, with or without a God or a religion.

Zenaan, I am so sorry for you, for your weakness of character, and
this poor minded and pretentious kind of people who talks about your
sex life in public.  Search for better contacts and partners.  Avoid
the white supremacists and the hypocrites, please.  Avoid lies and
becoming even worse.
All religions are about love, but you can make a harmful, prejudiced
interpretation of all existent religious texts.  You need to follow
your heart, the love's path, and try to make better this world because
it will be our heritage to the future generations.  If your heart and
soul are so poor, so limited and weak, what I can sincerely recommend
to you is reading another excerpt of the Bible:
# 1 Corinthians 13 (ESV - English Standard Version)
The Way of Love
1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I
am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
2 And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all
knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but
have not love, I am nothing.
3 If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be
burned,but have not love, I gain nothing.
4 Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant
5 or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;
6 it does not rejoice at wrong doing, but rejoices with the truth.
7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,
endures all things.
8 Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for
tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.
9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
10 but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.
11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I
reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.
12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know
in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.
13 So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest
of these is love.

Hi, Juan!  Hi, everybody!  :D
I was searching a little bit and talked with two friends who made
their post-doctorship in Tokyo.  Well, you are correct:  "Kutabare"
means "fall dead!" and "Shine"  (pronounce: something like "sheene")
means "die!", "go to Hell!" and similar expressions.  In Japan, they
use "Engurishu"  (English in "Engurishu", haha!!)  and the young
people usually say "Fuck You", but the sound is a bit strange, more or
less, "Fa~ku".
In countries where existed Japanese immigration, some of the old
"nihongo"  (Japanese language)  expressions were kept until now
("bendjou" isn't used in Japan actually, but is still used here
instead of "toeere" - toilet in "Engrish")  or were used in a
different sense  ("kutabare" is used as "fuck you" in some countries,
because it's more offensive than "die!").
Kisses!  :*
PS:  -  John, I love you and your messages, but I answer later because
I am almost "kutabareying"  - haha!! -  now, sorry.  Do you know the
history behind the New LW&C?  It's a fucking sad story, but its
background is very funny and  - wow! -  has very unexpected
connections with the Brazilian football  (Sorry, I prefer to use the
word "football" like in Europe.  It's ridiculous to call "football" a
sport where the guys use the hands and the arms to take the ball in
the whole game, aff...  And "soccer" is a word so meh, so
North-American...)  :-/
Mirimir sent me more amazing books suggestions in private a time ago,
John.  He is amazing, loves books and is my best imaginary friend.  I
do love him and I am calling him "my pineapple" the whole month of
October, because "my pumpkin" is already grarpamp, hahaha!!  ;D

Juan, I love you and want you very, very alive, healthy and happy.  If
you die, who will I annoy, eh?  ;)
You know part of my personal history and how much I love books and
comics.  I have a few hundreds of both and usually donate books to
that small public library where I've spent a great part of my
childhood.  More or less 95% of physical books and comics are in my
parents' house, not here, in a small apartment.  I have only 3
dictionaries of Japanese and only one is with me now.  Unfortunately,
it's the Japanese-Japanese, with the first 939 basic "kanjis", uff...
Some of the ideograms use until 23 movements  (I paint them, not
exactly write them.  Not shodo, but has its beauty too.).  It's pretty
cute, but it isn't being useful now.  So, I will annoy you showing
another kanji and a lovely Nasa link to send your name to Mars, eeee!!
 I choose "yume" because it means "dream" and shows a boy thinking
about rockets.  Aww...  :)
#  #  Sorry, the pic is really bad, but I am tired and still feeling pain.
If I really hate you, I would wish you several medical exams in your
cerebrospinal fluid.  It hurts a lot and I am not exactly the luckiest
person in the world, so the anesthesia never works.  All the times,
the doctor mentions my "outdoor" (the hidden big tattoo) and we talk
about strange subjects to distract me, so I don't feel so much pain,
but I can't laugh or move during the procedure.
The cutest Japanese way to say "die!" is asking you to beat your head
against the corner of a "tofu"  (very soft soy cheese)  until you
die...  And "kutabare" means "fuck you" in my neighborhood.  I asked
my neighbors and now I want to discover the correct kanji to this
expression...  Shit (or "kuso", if you prefer), hiragana doesn't
count, Juan!  :P
Later, in another thread, I _do need_ to talk about the fabulous
samurai manga mentioned by John.  Love them, but you need to read the
old Lone Wolf And Cub.  It's extremely sad, heartbreaking, but very
beautiful and delicate.  And I am in love with Elizebeth Friedman,
wow!  And she was born on August, 26, wheee!!  ;D

Hi, John!  Hope you are doing amazing and reading a lot of manga!  :D
#  In 2002, during the World Cup, the Brazil national football team was
the champion and Ronaldo was the Cup's top scorer, our best player.
Do you recognize his haircut?  :)
#  #  #  Hahaha!!!  The Word Cup happened in Japan and Korea and Japanese
people are very superstitious and love the "Lone Wolf And Cub" series,
so Kazuo Koike received hundreds and hundreds of letters and e-mails
begging for Daigoro' stories after his father's death.  They said that
Ronaldo's haircut was a signal of God, of Goseki Kojima to write more
stories giving Daigoro, still a toddler, a destiny.
So Koike asked for permission to Kojima's family and got a very brave
artist, with a similar style to Kojima, named Hideki Mori.  It was a
great honor, a huge responsibility, so Mori trained days and nights
like a crazy, almost becoming sick with all his efforts, giving his
best to make his drawings the most similar possible to Kojima's art.
All his drawings and paintings were revised for Kazuo Koike because he
promised it to Kojima's family and to the LW&C fans.  He searched the
perfection to honor his friend and collaborator, Goseki Kojima.
Loyalty and respect until the end.  <3
Wish you loyal and good friends, my dear.  Take care.  <3

How about the other "Cecilias Tanakas" and the pics you've in private to me
asking me if it was me, if I was celebrating with my parents, my whole
family...  You did ask about my mom's apparence.  Do you remember now?  Not
my family, I would never post my family pics on Facebook and never did it
in my few years there.
My account was deleted more than an year and almost half ago, after
understanding how much I needed to say goodbye to Aleph and other dead
friends.  I was not a slave of FB, of this company, but of my own memories
of my past, happy laughs, sad stories, professional cute contacts, couch
surfing, hackerspaces, events in the whole world...  Amazingly creative
people!  <3
I survived to death 5 times, Zenaan.  The last one because I had to
physically fight for living and I was very hurt, so tired of everything,
but living it was more important.  It's really repugnant the idea of
hurting someone, but I decided to learn better this kind of radical things
to keep protected my loved ones. I do not care about me, but about those
who I love...
Well, I am avoiding virtual contacts with some good people because I know I
can be tracked and I am not smart enough to protect them sufficiently.  It
hurts me a lot. In some cases, I just wanted to say "I love you" and hug
them, really feel their bodies warmer and relaxed between my arms.
So many demands for precise communication, so little time to
respond to trolls...
It's easy to get more time for reading and give good answers, without poor
evasive lies.  Stop licking dogs', Putin's and Trump's balls.  And, of

Hi, Mark!  Thanks for answering, really appreciated it!  :D
Well, in the beginning, considering the Bible, everything was chaos
and darkness and God used the Word and created the light and, with it,
the world.  In different religious texts around the world, there are
several references to the power of the words to create, manage and/or
destroy, so I would very cautious about using God and religion and/or
religious books to get a real anarchy.  Usually, religions are
powerful, used to manipulate people, Mark, and I don't like this idea,
even being favorable to get the complete anarchy.  You need choose to
be free, understanding really well what being free means.
Yesterday, I had a very hard discussion about Old and New Testaments
of the Bible, the contradictions, the lapses, with a very interesting
Spiritualist teacher, who follows Allan Kardec's teachings
.  I am discussing the
Spiritism with a little group of friends because we are getting
donations for the Christmas all the weekends since last month.  It's
fun and a bit bizarre because I am doing the same with my Catholic
friends, who hate the Spiritualists and, at least for me, to hate, to
be so intolerant of the people is a sooo anti-God's love thing, haha!!
 ;D
Well, I am trying hard to get food, clothes, toys, and medicines for
orphanages, nursing homes, and poor families, not because of any God
or religion, but because I think it's the correct thing to be done if
I want a world a little better.  I don't know if God really exists and
I am not doing it because it's the hypocrite celebration of Jesus'
birth, but because it should be the rule of a good government:  help
the people with the basic necessities.  Unfortunately, no government
is good.  :(((

I already said thank you in private to Juan for the explanations on
this topic.  It makes sense in some points of view, considering that
all kinds of oppression and exploration against people are deplorable,
including eventually God's ones.  Probably, I am too stupid and Mark
is too confusing, but I didn't understand his point until now.  I am
not talking about genders, deities, religions, whatever.  I really
just wanted to understand how God can help to create the real anarchy
if God is a kind of government  (source of divine laws, rules,
judgments, etc)  too?  :P
In any case, I forgot to tell Juan I am re-reading the "Bhagavad Gita"
   because of a great
friend of mine, who wrote an amazing post about it, mixing his
impressions of the book, now and when younger, with his own life and
coding.  It was a big shock for me.  It was one of Vincenzo, my
deceased fianc=C3=A9's favorite books and I only read the Italian version
and made completely different interpretations of the same book.  I
read the same book probably with the same age of my friend and it gave
us different visions of the world and completely different lives.
Books are powerful and change lives.

Michael Jackson - Thriller
# [Michael Jackson:]
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurkin' in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl
But all the while you hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're outta time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with the forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life
They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together
All through the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen,
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul could ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul could ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
[Vincent Price:]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
And whomsoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
[Michael Jackson:]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight...
[Vincent Price:]
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller
[Into maniacal laugh, in deep echo]

body odor.  Captain Crunch is a legend and, in several aspects, one of

I am really afraid he can be feeling very confused and depressed.  I
don't know if someone in the past did understand in a wrong way his
words and/or acts because I already did voluntary work with autistic
persons and it's very hard to communicate with them.  In some moments,
some of them touched my breasts or butt, but with absolutely no
malice.  They were just trying to get my attention for helping with
drawings and other pretty innocent activities.
It's a very controversial subject and I am feeling hurt and shocked

OK, Tim May, nice to meet you.  Sorry for knowing you prefer to read
and write about donkey's penises in the Bible and share it publicly in
other lists now, instead of helping the CypherPunks list sharing your
knowledge about coding, crypto, security, privacy, governments, with
people who want to study and learn more about it.
You can know much more than me, but if Zenaan Harkness is your
personal friend, sorry, your heart is definitely not in the right
place and I can respect your works, but not you.

Sorry for asking, but what or who the f_ck is "Tim May"?  Zenaan
always mentions this garbage and I feel absolutely no will of
researching more hypocrite nazi white supremacists like him.  After
Zenaan sent that message saying Tim May likes to read about "donkeys'
penises" in the Bible, I really think both are very, very awkward and

Hi, Joe!  Hope you are doing good and having an amazing Friday night!  :)
You probably get a really bad impression of this list.  It is
definitely not a "comfy heartwarming group", but don't be scared,
please.  There are amazing people here, I swear.  <3
There is no formal moderation on this list.  Please, always consider
that freedom and autonomy are key cypherpunk values.  Take in mind
that people should be able to use good sense and self-moderation.
In the last case, we always can use lots and lots of filters to avoid
trolls and their garbage in our inboxes.  I filter out what I don't
want.  Several others do the same.  I do not decide for others and I
want absolutely no one to decide for me.  :)
I strongly recommend you a moderated technical list for exchanging
impressions about some cryptography subjects:
#  The cryptography mailing list
#  cryptography
#  We have excellent security professionals and hackers of all colors of
hats here, but most of them are lurking, dreaming and waiting for the
return of the great old times of the CypherPunks list.  ;)
Please, stay if you think you can change the list and make it better, not for
the list itself, but for you, for other people.  You already have a
technical background and like to study.  You can share your knowledge
and will probably be contacted in public or private for others like
There are lots of trolls here, like Zenaan Harkness, whose most erotic
fetish is saying "I should be raped again and killed this time", and
other sweet private and public e-mails, always using ridiculous fake
addresses, aff...  But there are really good and interesting, f_cking
awesome people here too.  A bit silent at the moment, I admit, but
they are still here, I swear.  :)
So, my dear Joe, you can go, if you think it will be better for you.
None of us can take this decision in your place, only you know your
necessities and your
limits.  In this case, wish you good luck and success.  Take care and
be very happy!  :)
In any case, you can choose read the messages in the list archive
only, picking the titles, without receiving all the messy messages.
If you need help, contact me in private.  I'm always late with my
personal messages  (the professional ones are updated, I swear!),  but
I will answer soon or later.  And you always can remember me if I
become too much late with answers, hahaha!!  ;D
Good night and sweet dreams, dear.  Take care.

chemical or biological weapon is very easy because of the direct contact

Hi, Hi!  :D

last message on this thread.
Zenaan, his fake profiles, and his friends are *extremely homophobic*

mentioning their obsession with c*cks, anal sex, Putin's topless
"sexy" pics and Trump's bizarre sexual preferences ("golden shower"

for still living in the closet, with lots of skeletons and repressed

white supremacist garbage to this list.

you!  <3
Some weeks ago, I had a very hard conversation with some friends and I
decided to avoid and/or boycott all the events with sexist or unfair
codes of conduct.  Good sense and conversation should be enough among
rational people.  We do not need hundreds of rules.  It's ridiculous
to prejudge someone because of their gender, race, sexual choice,
Well, I became a kind of "case" for being the first girl of the Human
Sciences Area to become a co-founder and a member of the PyLadies in
my country.  After a lot of discussions, I left my own group,
considered actually the biggest Brazilian female coding group, because
of the prejudice of some members (cis women) against men and trans
They seem to hate any human being with a penis and some of them say
that feel very "uncomfortable" with trans women "because they are not
like us".  I did sincerely reject it with all my heart.  They are
using their vaginas like weapons to justify making the same kind of
discrimination and violent attacks that we used to suffer in the past.
We have vaginas, but we are not victims and now it's time for talking
about technology and stop with all the drama.
Shit, I want more and more women talking about technology, not anymore
about how hard is to be a woman talking about tech, how hard is being
a woman, the eternal non-stop victimism.  Yes, we still have victims,
but we also need to show some work instead of only drama.  God, it is
not impossible or so hard!  We just need a bit more of good-will and
I was and I am still the moderator of the PyLadies and Django Girls
Brazilian lists, but we had a horrible discussion about the fact I
always approve male confirmed collaborators, which I've known in
person.  They are helping the groups, so they deserve the chance of
giving their opinions and feedbacks about important subjects, like our
meetings.  I don't know if Freud can explain it, but some of these
women are mean, selfish, and just want fame, become known in the tech
area, and seem to see men like stronger candidates for the same jobs
and talks.
Last week, some evil women very, very limited and stupid wanted
to punish a girl who tweeted a post only because it was written by a
man.  Can you believe it?  It was so ridiculous, so surreal, that I
decided to become more present in the discussions and a little bit
more "savage".  My English stinks, but my Portuguese is precise and
very good, so I can present several rational arguments and...  well...
you can imagine the drama, uff...

poor victim".  :((

I read an old joke and I should not laugh, but I did it.  ;P
"My friend said I make him feel uncomfortable because I violate his
personal space. I was hurt. He completely ruined our bath."
Oh, I forgot to say I don't tweet using the PyLadies account.  Only
three girls do it and I personally appreciate a lot two of them, more
rational and mature than the others.  The "fucking horrible tweet" was
a post about Turing written by a man.  The retard who made a scandal
and sent us a message saying "we are sharing a post written by a man
about another man" was particularly aggressive.
God, I love Turing and my heart always breaks when I think about his
sad history...  And the PyLadies account should be used to share
interesting news and posts about technology, not only Python news and
just women's posts.  It's sexism, feminazism, and I reject this.  Fuck
all the rules that they want to put in one more Conduct Code.  I

because of their genitals.

Some weeks ago, I had a very hard conversation with some friends and I
decided to avoid and/or boycott all the events with sexist or unfair
codes of conduct.  Good sense and conversation should be enough among
rational people.  We do not need hundreds of rules.  It's ridiculous
to prejudge someone because of their gender, race, sexual choice,
Well, I became a kind of "case" for being the first girl of the Human
Sciences Area to become a co-founder and a member of the PyLadies in
my country.  After a lot of discussions, I left my own group,
considered actually the biggest Brazilian female coding group, because
of the prejudice of some members (cis women) against men and trans
They seem to hate any human being with a penis and some of them say
that feel very "uncomfortable" with trans women "because they are not
like us".  I did sincerely reject it with all my heart.  They are
using their vaginas like weapons to justify making the same kind of
discrimination and violent attacks that we used to suffer in the past.
We have vaginas, but we are not victims and now it's time for talking
about technology and stop with all the drama.
Shit, I want more and more women talking about technology, not anymore
about how hard is to be a woman talking about tech, how hard is being
a woman, the eternal non-stop victimism.  Yes, we still have victims,
but we also need to show some work instead of only drama.  God, it is
not impossible or so hard!  We just need a bit more of good-will and
I was and I am still the moderator of the PyLadies and Django Girls
Brazilian lists, but we had a horrible discussion about the fact I
always approve male confirmed collaborators, which I've known in
person.  They are helping the groups, so they deserve the chance of
giving their opinions and feedbacks about important subjects, like our
meetings.  I don't know if Freud can explain it, but some of these
women are mean, selfish, and just want fame, become known in the tech
area, and seem to see men like stronger candidates for the same jobs
and talks.
Last week, some evil women very, very limited and stupid wanted
to punish a girl who tweeted a post only because it was written by a
man.  Can you believe it?  It was so ridiculous, so surreal, that I
decided to become more present in the discussions and a little bit
more "savage".  My English stinks, but my Portuguese is precise and
very good, so I can present several rational arguments and...  well...
you can imagine the drama, uff...
I am very unhappy too, my dear.  And I am a cute hetero cis woman, "a
poor victim".  :((

"My friend said I make him feel uncomfortable because I violate his
personal space. I was hurt. He completely ruined our bath."
Oh, I forgot to say I don't tweet using the PyLadies account.  Only
three girls do it and I personally appreciate a lot two of them, more
rational and mature than the others.  The "fucking horrible tweet" was
a post about Turing written by a man.  The retard who made a scandal
and sent us a message saying "we are sharing a post written by a man
about another man" was particularly aggressive.
God, I love Turing and my heart always breaks when I think about his
sad history...  And the PyLadies account should be used to share
interesting news and posts about technology, not only Python news and
just women's posts.  It's sexism, feminazism, and I reject this.  Fuck
all the rules that they want to put in one more Conduct Code.  I
respect human beings because of their knowledge, their character, not
because of their genitals.
I love you, dear.  Take care and be happy, please.

My dear garbage fire brother,
Please, do *not* take my words of its context and stop telling daily lies.
Jeez, is it not a sin in your religion?  It's really disgusting!  :(((
I would *never* ask for any murder.  Why the heck do you think I am a
veggie since my earlier years?  Because I was a hipster, being veggie
before it becomes hype, very cool?  Hahahaha!!!  ;D
I do *not* support any death.  And, sorry, if you were not informed about
it, the life of cows, pigs, chickens, cats, dogs, koalas, and several other
animals, is *not* more important than *any human life*, including yours.
But I confess that, technically, I don't include you among the rational
beings.  Already met doggies much smarter than you.  And they were cuter
and less boring too!  :D
I do not know if there is a Hell or not, my detestable garbage fire
brother, but in positive case, we will meet there someday and, remember,
you will arrive first.  You are much older and hated than me, so the
probabilities are better on my side, hahaha!!    ;)
I hope your atoms can be used in a better way, like beautiful flowers and
trees.  James, you are a bad seed, a rotten apple in the society, spreading
hate and intolerance.  You are the broken potato chip in the package, the
one that always makes a mess and is wasted, aff...  :(((
Ah, my dear, remember that I am being banned and excluded in some feminist
radical groups for defending equality of treatment of women and men, for
really believing that intelligence and character are much more important
than genders, races, religions, sexual options, whatever...
I will always try to respect all the people, but illogical, heartless
racist, sexist, and homophobic garbage fire people like you do *not*
deserve my respect and my time.
I am deeply sorry for disappointing you, but instead of "enthusiastically
calling for the murder of Christians, whites, and males", I do prefer to
mourn the recent deaths of my friends and think about the future, about our
lost plans and dreams.
All the three were "Christian white males", but it doesn't matter.  What is
really important, what is making me cry for their deaths, is the fact that
all the three were lovely, very kind, amazing human beings, always trying
to share their knowledge and helping other people.  I will miss them until
the last of my days.
Who will cry for your death, James?  Who will miss you?  Nobody.
Bye bye, baby!  See you in Hell or maybe in another reincarnation.  It's
also a possibility to be strongly considered, because Zenaan and you are
the living proofs of the existence of other lives.  Nobody can become so
odious, hateful, and stupid in one single human life.  It takes muuuch
time...  :P

My dearest Juan,
If I want to be an Atheist, a Shinto, a Jew, a Christian, or whatever, is
my problem.  It's my opinion, my faith, my personal belief.
So, if I want to believe in a hypothetical God full of love and compassion,
the problem is mine.  Only mine, Juan.
I do have the right of imagining how would be God if They exist.  I know I
can be completely wrong about Their kindness and compassion, but...
well...  so what?  Who does care about my religious opinion?  Certainly,
not you.  :)
And already read the Bible sometimes.  It's very confused and
contradictory.  A horrible fiction book.

Technically, I am an Atheist, Juan.  I've lost my faith in some point
of my life and I know there will not be a return, but I still pray all
the days to a God that I don't know if exists or not, asking to
protect this world and all the people, in special my loved ones.  I

like to believe that there is something, someone much bigger than us,

We never meet each other, but we both are made of atoms.  The atoms of
the sunflower that I am touching now could contain some old atoms of
your skin.  Or Tesla's, maybe.  Who knows?  Maybe God exists only in
the Science, when Chemistry makes its magic, being used to create and
recreate biological and chemical structures.  In any case, almost all
the religions deserve my respect, after analyzing some details.
Well, until a few years ago, a North-American State had a very old law
permitting to shoot in Mormons.  When I read it, I became horrified
with the religious discrimination, but a friend asked me to read about
the Mormons' beliefs before giving any opinion...  Well, I still
considered the law pretty unfair, but I simply could not accept all
those stupid stories as a formal religion.  But also all the other
religions that I studied have very contradictory and surreal facts and
acts, so I try to respect all of them, trying to get what they have of
good to offer, to teach me, and rejecting what doesn't seem logical
for me.  This year, I helped two different religions/churches with the
donations of Christmas gifts for poor children in orphanages and for
old people left alone for their own families in retirement homes.  The
past and the future of my country.  Two different churches, but I
don't follow any religion.  I just wanted a bit fairer world, less
sad, less miserable, at least for one single day of my life, of their
I am *not* a good example of the Japanese culture and I would *never*
be pretentious enough to affirm something different, Juan.  I know I
will always be considered a "gaijin" in the land of my ancestors, even
moving to there and presenting all my Japanese documentation.  My
blood is Japanese, but not my way of thinking, living, moving,
talking, feeling, or making things, and being very sincere, I do *not*
care about it.  I am exactly who I could be and I am following my own
way, still trying to be who I should be.

#  English Version
Sleep, my little prince, sleep,
The sheep and the birdies rest,
The garden and the meadow are quiet,
Not even a little bee buzzes anymore.
Luna, with a silverly glow
Looks in through the window,
Sleep by the silvery glow,
Sleep, my little prince, sleep,
Sleep, sleep!
By now, all are in bed in the castle,
All lulled into a slumber,
No more mice stir,
The basement and kitchen are empty.
Only in the maid's chambers
There sounds a languishing sigh!
What might this sigh be for?
Sleep, my little prince, sleep,
Sleep, sleep!
Who is happier than you?
Nothing but pleasure and peace!
All trinkets and sugar,
And a trotting stage-coach.
Everyone's anxious and ready
That my little prince will just not cry.
But what will the future bring?
Sleep, my little prince, sleep,
Sleep, sleep!

Sorry for disappointing you so much, my dear Juan.  It would be a
gorgeous thing to do today, but Rayzer, my Jewish ex-boyfriend, and
the most of my Jewish male single friends are pretty far from me,
living in the USA.  So I think it would be much easier to me choosing
between fucking an Atheist or fucking a Catholic.  Some special
preference, dear?  hahaha!!!  ;D
God, I swear I do still not understand why the heck you hate so much
the Jewish people, Juan!  It's their religion, their faith, and should
be respected as any other, my dear.
You would like to study some of the Jewish principles, Juan.  They
remember me a lot some of the most important Japanese beliefs:  -
Protect your people, your family, your honor.  Respect the wiseness of
the older ones and teach the younger ones how to be good persons,
trying to keep pure their hearts and souls.  Study all the days of
your life, never stop studying.  Respect and honor your parents and
your family's traditions.  Respect your wife/husband and your eventual
sons and daughters.  They will be your blood and flesh and you will
live in their lives, even when your bones become dust and your name
becomes a pretty far memory.  Don't be lazy or selfish.  Be grateful
for being alive and keep surviving.  Always keep surviving to preserve
your proud people's History alive, even after wars, holocausts, and
nuclear bombs, my dear.
And, of course, always make jokes...  Laughing makes the tears less
bitter...  ;)

It's much better to be a "young soul", still pure, innocent, dreaming
about a world where people won't be judged by their race, gender,
religion, sexual preferences, etc, than becoming soulless, old at
heart, bitter, and hateful.
Some guys should spend more time searching for a really good
psychiatric support and an urgent treatment for dyslexia instead of
sending fake news and messages supporting all the possible kinds of
stupid prejudices.
Hmm, the CP list's dyslexic "genius" is very, very slow and probably
does not know what means "dyslexia"...  :-/
Better to give him a link with easy and fast information or the
"infinite delay guy" will never understand why he is not able to write
Shawn, John, and Lauren's names correctly, or making a simple and
correct interpretation of their posts, without modifying the original
texts, adding and/or removing important parts of them, aff...  ;P
Intellectual fraud is not accepted in my country, but I don't know how
it works in Australia.  Does it exist in your country, "Harkless"?  I

"Cock carousel", "bad boys", "Social Justice Warrior", "no friends"...
Tsk, tsk...  So sorry for you, James.  Your senile dementia is evidently
becoming pretty worse and, strangely, very "selective" about subjects
related to your personal life.  :)
Why are you obviously avoiding to answer *which exactly is your church*, my
darling?  Fear of being rejected by all the other members?  Or are you
feeling ashamed for following a very stupid not recognized Christian
church?  Hihihi...  ;)
Well, I never was a "Social Justice Warrior" or claimed to be one of them.
And I do really not understand why you think I don't have a social life, a
family, and real good friends, people which deserve my most sincere love
and care.
Do you think I spend my free time searching for "allies"?  Which kind of
"alliance" and exactly for what, please?  God, it makes no sense, aff...
Did Gandalf invite me to a journey with hobbits, elves and dwarfs, and I
wasn't informed about it yet?  :P
Seriously, James, I do also love German men, but your intense relationship
with Dr. Alzheimer is becoming indecently explicit...  :P
If you are describing your own miserable life, please, do not project your
loneliness and your social frustrations in me.  I am not guilty if you had
a "bad boy's cock carousel" and never received a call or a text in the day
after.  I swear it never was my case, darling.  Hehe, Oriental charm, you
know...  Oh, no, you do *not* know, hahaha!!!  ;D
I am much better than you in several aspects, including the sexual one,
obviously.  I don't need Viagra or other drugs for being 'ready' and I
don't need to sleep the whole night to get the 'second round', hahaha!!!  ;D
A few days ago, you wrote two very stupid messages showing your evident
ignorance about feeding.  You don't know anything about the difference
between "vegetarian" and "vegan" diets and beliefs, even being f_cking easy
to make a simple 5 minutes research and reading.
So, I suggest you to read about "straight edge" people.  You will spend
only a few minutes and will learn a lot about me, poor old loser.
Tell us which is your church, dear.  Why are you being so shy?  And why do
you think you will never receive anonymous packs with dildos and anal beads
in your so pure and sacred home, uh?  :)
Oh, and if you like talking to rejected, lonely, and needy bitches, you
should consider to send your nasty messages to your friend Zenaan, not for
me or to this list, James.  :P
You both should find more guys like you and making a hot "lemon party".
Oh, it will be amazing if Trump accept your invitation, sweetie!  You
already said publicly that "he's very handsome, tall, and rich"!  :D
Well, it is what *you* search in a man, not me.  I search for intelligence,
character, and sense of humor.  And Trump seems an old orange disgusting
frog, but uglier and less intelligent and smart, eeeck!!!  (>_<)*
It was very embarrassing to receive lots of Zenaan's stupid messages
begging for a bit of attention, mentioning my cuteness and intelligence,
trying desperately to get an answer.  He never understood I only appreciate
intelligent men and the poor devil is so homophobic that will never leave
the closet, even more the box, hahaha!!  ;D
Regards to your fictional "happy family", James.  Hope you are not the
father of some of your grandchildren, bad seed guy!  Ugh, it's a pretty

it's a possibility to be seriously considered...  :(((

Social Justice Warriors always project.  I hear the voice of a woman who
has cats instead of children.
When you die, no one will notice, and your cats will eat you.
I have children, I have grandchildren.  You think you have friends, but
observe how progressives treat their "friends".
When progs die, their cats eat them.
Oh, dear...  Are you hearing the voice of a woman who has cats instead of
children?  Are you sure?  Another time, like you mentioned a semester ago
and also last year?  :((
So you are listening really bad and/or imagining things, my poor old
James...  Tsk, tsk...  Evident signals of dementia.  :-/
Well, in your age, becoming senile and mixing facts, sounds, and memories
is very natural, but I sincerely recommend you to search for some good
medical care in 2018, if you can pay for it, of course.
Good psychiatrists and otolaryngologists  (ENT doctors)  are really
expensive in your country.  Trump f_cked the healthcare pretty well in only
one year, didn't he?  ;)
I do *not* have cats or any pets and already wrote it so many times here
that even a senile old man like you could remember.  And already said
several times why are my reasons for not having children.  It was my
personal choice and I will never regret it, even loving very, very much
children and my never born daughters and sons...  I want to protect them of
people like you, Zenaan, Trump, of this unfair world, full of hate and
stupid prejudices...  <\3
Well, in any case, did you already try DNA exams?  Considering your
"fascinating personality", I bet your children can easily being postman's
and milkman's kids, hihihi...  :)
Well, anyway, having children and grandchildren means absolutely nothing,
James.  N-O-T-H-I-N-G, do you understand?  No real warranty of mourning,
drama, and tears.
Why do you think they will miss you?  Or will sincerely cry for your
death?  These are a few of all the probabilities to be considered, if you
have at least one single active neuron, James.  Too hard for you?  Oh, poor
old man!  Let me help you with very simple explanations, something nearby
to your intellectual level...  :)
They probably hate you and/or feel deeply ashamed of being related to
someone so odious, bitter, and cruel like you, that always writes hateful
texts, full of all kinds of stupid prejudices, and, all the semesters,
tries to hurt me mentioning exactly the same things...  Aff, you are so
repetitive that it probably is an obvious signal of Alzheimer's disease...
You always say you have children and grandchildren  (I will only believe
after receiving all the DNA exams results, haha!!)  and that I will be
eaten by my inexistent cats because nobody will notice my death, blah,
blah...  So f_cking what?  Why do you think it will hurt me, stupid and
limited creature?  :-/
I know it's very hard for you, but simply consider the obvious:  - I do not
care about your opinion.  I do not respect you.  I do not care about your
life or your death, about what you had or have, about what you did or do.
You means nothing for me.
And just to register it another time, I do not fear my own death.  I do
really not care about my ending.  What I fear, what hurts my heart and soul
are my loved ones' deaths, their pains...  Loving is much more important
than living, even for people like me.
I have different grades of love and friendship.  Always had, but only this
year, I finally learned to make the distinction between real friends and
those "friends" who just remember my existence when need a lawyer, my
contacts, or my knowledge about some non-public data, meetings, and
Some weeks ago, I was the only person in a group of religious studies to
accept the hypothesis of dying in that exact moment.  Already had a
gorgeous life, true love, and true friends...  Much music, all kind of
readings and people crossed my way, and my life was very fun and
interesting for myself.  Full of unexpected dramas, certainly, but I had
much more joys and sincere happiness than most of the humanity already had
and I sincerely thank the Universe, or maybe God, for this beautiful life.
I really prefer to die just right now than walking to the East of Eden for
all the eternity, never meeting the death, my own end.  It's cruel and I
cannot believe in a cruel God.  You always say you are "Christian".  OK,
which is your Christian Church, James?  There are hundreds of them in the
whole world...  :P

offering my home and my personal contacts to give him some support.**
He could simply give me a sincere heads up in private about my messages,
honestly criticizing them and their content, when, only some weeks ago,
contacted me in private asking about me.  I was so, really so happy for
knowing his personal storm was apparently finished and he was doing
good...  I was very stupid.
Well, not my problem anymore.  He knows very well how much I do hate false
and hypocrite persons and I will never trust him again.  Really sorry for
wasting my time last year, reading his "pathetic" private messages asking
for help and answering to them when he was feeling deeply sad and lost.
I hate the sensation of being humiliated in public for someone that I used
to trust, someone who used to be my friend, but it is evidently **not** a
problem for him, so he will not waste his time reading this message and
giving it an answer.  Anyway, he died for me yesterday and I think a
supposed "badass hacker" knows very well how to create messages filters.
Wish you all a lovely day.  I will lurk for some time because it will

So James, how long have you been experiencing these bizarre delusions?
Have you have any visual or auditory hallucinations?  Have you reported
them to your psychologist or psychiatrist?
Steve, my lovely friend, is pretty obvious James had no psychological
and/or psychiatriac support until now.
James has a so sick and disturbing vision about single women and having
several children that makes possible to think seriously about an early
Oedipus Complex.
Well, Oedipus was the first, the original "motherf_cker".   I think it's a
pretty good way of describing James using one single word, but I bet he
never satisfied his sexual dreams while a kid because he's obviously also a
real "son of a b_tch" and probably could not pay his own mommy's prices, a
single woman working very, very hard with harder things...
Tsk, tsk...  Sad life history.  Search for medical support, James.  It can

        If you don't enable javascript that site won't show you any content
at all. They could have put a static page explaining  what the site is
about but apparently they were too lazy to do that.
        And, javascript is the number one tool used to track

the site is about) that refuses to do anything unless javascript is

Please do not confuse Java and JavaScript. The only relationship between
the two is that Netscape paid Sun to license the Java trademark to what

Please, today is Sunday.  Why do you not use the free time for getting a
life, eh?!  ;)
An OT personal story about "races" to explain that all the persons matter
the same, that all of them have their own beauty and beliefs:  -  In the
past, already had the chance of knowing two different Amazon's Indian
tribes.  I hated the f_cking heat and all the odious mosquitoes, had no
courage to eat ants and other insects, I was feeling dehydrated all the
time, and had a horrible fear of being bitten by a snake in my buttocks
while peeing in the forest.  It was a complete shit, a disaster, but
strangely, at same time, was very interesting and instructive.
I was the first Japanese girl that most of those Indians saw in their
lives.  I was f_cking pale, with freckles and brown curly hair, talking to
them with a strange accent, but intuitively they know we all were human
beings feeling exactly the same.  They respected me and I respected them.
We shared our food and water.  I painted their faces with my lipsticks and
they painted me with minerals and fruits natural pigments.
One of my friends  - and also one of my teachers -  is a Japanese guy
completely in love with Python.  He gave Python programming courses to new
PyLadies in several countries of the African continent and it was awesome.
His experiences were similar to mine in some aspects.
Humans beings like to learn and to teach each other, to share their
knowledge.  The color of your skin is just the way your skin is.  They
never thought  "Oh, poor yellow guy, so ignorant and inferior to us!"
The same happened with me among the Indians.  I was one of them, even
having a different apparence.
White, Black, Yellow, Red, Green, Purple, Plaid, Golden, Rainbow...  The
color of your skin is just a color.  The blood in our veins has the same
color, the same value.  Our tears and pains are the same.  We all feel
love, fear, joy, sadness, hunger, gratitude...  All lives matter.  All
lives are important.
Why to spend so much time trying to prove that black people are "inferior"
to you, James?  God, your ego must be more fragile than your balls...  Get
a life, please.  Search for psychological treatment and learn how much
bigger the world is than your own belly.
You are not a genius trying to share the  - ooooh! - "real truth".  You are
just an old sick man being used as a puppet to spread more hate in this
poor f_cked world.  This is the world where your grandchildren will grown
up, James.  If you really love them, think about their future, please.
Wish you all a lovely Sunday, full of harmony, peace, hopes, and the
sweetest dreams.
PS - OT: - "Braying" and "barking" do _not_ count as official languages,
ZeNazi.  Stop saying you are a polyglot, please.  It's very embarrassing
when you pretend to be an "intellectual" in other lists, eeeck!  :((

        I'm of course referring to the feminists. The 'progressives' are
nothing but recycled puritan monkeys with exactly the same lunatic anti sex

        Funnily enough there is a sizable number of fake libertarian scum

fascists with a thin veneer of libertarian rhetoric so it's hardly
surprising. So libertarians are apologist of google, goldmand sachs and

eugenics, and the voting record of the 'democratic party' regarding slavery
        last but not least, the same western 'progressives' who stridently

"American Idiot" - Green Day
Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new media
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind-fuck America
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
Well maybe I'm the faggot America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
Don't wanna be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information Age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America
Welcome to a new kind of tension

Just an excerpt from "Crying For Help" lyrics...
"I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense in it all
The rain on my face
It covers the trace
Of all the tears
I've had to waste
Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry?
All that I need
Is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me
Cry for help
All I can do"
Is cry for help
No need to feel ashamed
Release the pain
Cry for help"
But my broken heart is singing this song in the last days...
"Don't wanna to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love again
I'll never love again, ooh..."

love pizza, but my mom and sister think pizza is just "meh" and prefer
Japanese food, less greasy.  OK, I also love Japanese food, but pizza is so

a lovely, cute pizza!  :P)

Yeah, he was a disgusting politician of his time, basically a serial
killer.  He used alive persons just to test their new swords.  They should
cut bones and flesh so fast and softly as possible.
I already tried 'kenjutsu' and 'kendo', John.  There are always "free
teachers" for those who are able to show their soul for complete and have
real discipline.  I think a training with a sword shows more about a
person's character than beautiful words about honor, loyalty, respect and
justice, the real pillars of the warrior in my humble opinion.  I bet you
and Juan will love it.  It's deeply beautiful, I swear.
My deceased Italian fiance, my first love, was an archer.  A really good
one.  But I've meet another archer much better in my own country.  And he's
one of the best Brazilian security researchers.  Sounds strange, but he's
so pure, so innocent and sweet...  A great and generous soul.  I wish him
all the happiness of this world and he will never know it.  This little
secret makes me smile when I read about him.

"SleaZen" likes to call me a "trannie", an offensive way to make reference
to "trans women".  So I think it's pretty fair to call her a trans woman
too.  And "she" is ugly even using filters for pics, aff...
I do not care about her external ugliness, but she has more vanity and
egocentrism than Lucifer.  Her soul is rotten and she has not a heart.  Her
soul is ugly too.
She can lie and pretend to be kind when she wants, but is a just a stupid
psychopath, a bad actress, trying to spread hate against Black people,
Jews, Muslims, Women (cis and trans), and everybody more intelligent than
her.  Oh, almost the whole humanity!  :D
Well, I prefer to forget SleaZen's existence forever, because she's a toxic
troll, a fire garbage, and a non interesting subject for us, my dear.
In any case, I will support your decision about fun nicks, because a bully
needs bullying to learn how horrible and sad is the sensation of being
humiliated in a group.
Oh, Shawn, I didn't watch the video because I know it's rotten and hateful
like her.
Let's talk about more relevant subjects than "SleaZen", "Zeep The Bleep",
"ZeNazi", "Zzzzzenaan", and her many other nicks.  Maybe about kittens and
puppies?  Or crypto and coding?  Hihihi...  ;)
You know, I said I am the list's "favorite lawyer", but every alive being
knows that nobody likes lawyers, hahahaha!!!  ;D
Tender kisses, my dear.  Wish you and your loved ones much peace, love, and
sweetness.  Take care and keep away from racist monsters.

Nasa is not just a weapons manufacturer, my dear.  I thank you for being
very gentle and kind when made a reference to my family's death.  I hate
nuclear bombs and its devasting effects, but I love all about the space
exploration since I was a child, my darling.
You probably know how much I love starry nights and the moon.  In some
moments, I still wait to see ghost riders crossing the skies in constant
fire, or a cute bunny making 'mochi' in the moon (it's a Japanese legend),
or Saint George and the dragon fighting over the moon, or simply lovely
sweet falling stars...  We are just star dust, dear...  :)
There are good and bad people in all the places, my love.  Not only at
Nasa, or at Google.  The human being is very strange in their choices.
My friends deserve my sincere love e devotion.  I don't feel comfortable
anymore about Google and will change a lot of things soon, but my loyalty
is only for my friends, not for the company where they work.
The same about Nasa.  Do you remember how you loved to call my Nasa friends
something like "f*cking Nasists"?  Hahahaha!!!  ;D
I respect their work, but I know that there are very strange things
happening.  I just can wait for the best, but taking care about all the

neither in Brazil or Japan.  Really sorry whether it happens in USA.

friends with 72, 88, 92, etc, etc, years old, and I loved to make stupid
jokes when some of them were 69 years old, hahahaha!!!  ;D
Also have lots of teenager friends and it's fun to mix the ideas of both
groups.  Life is funnier when you learn something new all the days!  :D
Well...  You do need to manage better your diabetes.  Sorry for saying it,
but you should walk around or try biking.  Pardon, you are overweight and
it is definitely not good for your health, with or without coronavirus.
Control your fears. Try to occupy your mind with good thoughts and fun
hobbies.  No panic, please.
I live in a place very famous for being the "Oriental District" of the
whole country and for being one of the most haunted places of the city.
Life is still the same here.  Or death, in the ghosts' case.

Hi, Karl.  Nice to meet you.  I think you already know my name is Cecilia
Tanaka and I hope this message can help you a little bit.
When someone very cruel mentions my death, my temperamental health, or my
physical fragility, saying I will die soon, I simply (try to) ignore.  It
happened last week again, when I was trying to help a person who wrote to
the hackerspace begging for attention.  It was unexpected and painful, but
I do not care about dying.  I only care about my loved ones.  So I live
pretty far from my family to keep them safe.
When I am in a chaotical moment, when my body just wants to die, I use
several alarms to keep me alive.  Alarms for meals, for drinking water, for
taking medicines, for taking showers, for sleeping, and also for waking
up.  You are the master of your body, so please keep it working in a
satisfactory way.
Remember:  -  You need hydration, food, and sleep to keep alive and sane.
Please, try to keep your sanity.  You will need it to destroy companies and
governments in the future.
I love World of Warcraft, thank you a lot for your anonymous efforts.  You
love games.  I think I have no many good things in this moment.
Hmm, I think I still have some cyberpunk games, like Orwell, but now it
would not be healthy for you.  It made me feel afraid of the future the
same way like "COVID-1984".  A pandemia was the perfect excuse to all the
governments spy our activities and I do hate this horribly crazy dystopia.
Do you like books, comics, movies, series, jokes, music, something I can
(try to) get for you?  Sorry, I don't know anything about you, but I want
to help you to calm yourself.  Already had very stressful moments and
surviving to them alone is always hard.
Search for comfortable things.  Comfy food, those easy foods to take like
soups, yoghurt, sandwiches, etc;  comfy drinks like no-caffeine tea, hot
chocolate, pure water, fresh juices;  and try to relax your mind reading,
listening music, doing something that you really appreciate. Writing,
drawing, painting, coding, having sex and/or masturbation...
Don't forget to sleep, please.  It's very important.  When I don't sleep,
after three days, my writing and my memory become so confused, living is so
strange...  The sensation is scarier than you can imagine.
Feel free to contact me in private and keep breathing, Karl.  Just remember

Well, Karl, sorry for taking so many naps and also my "beauty sleep", but
these medicines make me painless, but sick and pretty sleepy.
I need to sleep while I can.  After the surgery it will be very very hard
to sleep in the first days and I will take three months for healing.

healing and I need patience, but this time I think I will sleep and, with

Relax, please.  You are more anxious than me when I am having a hardcore
insomnia crisis.  Listen to some music.

Karl, still alive, don't worry.  No panic.  I am almost immortal, I swear.
More lives than 9 (nine!!!) cats together, do you remember?  :)
You can ask about my health and my several accidents in the local OAB, the
Brazilian Bar Association.  They usually call me "Highlander, the
immortal", hahahaha!!!  ;D
About my pain...  Well, sorry for scaring you, but now I need to tell
something a bit embarrassing about me.
Already suffered several accidents and ruined some points of spine and back
having unusual habits and sex in non usual places.
Example: - Years ago, I broke my coccyx while having sex with my fiance in
the office stairs at night.  He was pretty excited, and while still fucking
me, threw me several stairs away, hahahaha!!!  It was f*cking painful, but
was so funny that I laugh until the hospital.  Obviously, the doctor asked
why I was almost naked and laugh more than me.
Already fell of several trees, bushes, stairs, walls, etc, and suffered
many accidents with skates, cars, robbers, stalkers, a lot of things...
Broke and/or had several injuries in both feets, both legs, arms, fingers,
spine, neck, head, some ribs, and so goes on...
Now, my spine will need the fourth surgery because the pain is becoming
unsupportive even for me.  Usually, I am considered pretty resistant to
pain for all my doctors.
And all these pains, muscles tension, lack of decent sleep, and stress are
causing strong migraines.  I do hate opioids and their disgusting effects,
but usual medication is not enough for controlling my physical pain in the
Sorry, I don't know to say it politely, but since yesterday, I am very busy
disgorging everything, even my internal organs and soul.  :P
So, being sincere, I am trying to rest a bit, because I had fever and
vomit, so I need to keep myself hydrated to avoid another physical
disaster.  And I am trying to discover what the hell happened with my
wi-fi.  I am using 4G for giving you some feedback.
Please, try to relax.  You are so stressed, boy.  Remember my cellphone is
not so awesome like me - hahahaha!!! - and sucks a lot.  Much more than I
already sucked something in my whole life, hahahaha!!!  ;D
Tender kisses and straight hugs.  Just relax and be well, please.  <3

Hi, Karl...  I will answer to you in private tomorrow.  Sorry for being so
late, but needed to visit the hospital because of a really strong and
inconvenient migraine.  My usual medicines didn't work and I was taking
them since yesterday.  :P
Not a good thing, but I need to consider several facts.  I had almost no
sleep since the last Tuesday and my insomnia is a powerful trigger to
migraines.  That's the reason why I am always complaining about feeling
sleepy too, hihihi...  :)
Well, I like hugs and snugglehugs, but only when I like the person who is
hugging me.  I try to avoid touching people who I cannot trust or like.
Bad energies, unpleasant vibes...
Please, do NOT stay away from your family.  Never do it.  I talk to my
parents all the days and receive daily blessings when my day begins and
when it is finished.  It's very comfortable to receive their wishes of good
days and good nights.
I put some physical distance because my family needs peace.  This way, I
don't need to explain a lot of bad things and they are secure.
Well, I don't use Facebook, sorry.  Even my Twitter account is a bit
paused.  I only use it to say hello in private to some friends or just for
lurking.  I am avoiding conflicts.
Hmm...  Let's find a way to send messages for you.  I need to find a way to
make my Session account works better in my cellphone.  I need to talk with
a great friend there, but the app is still a bit unstable and I have some
bad news for sharing.
I keep my dreams in a secret piece of my heart, but I can tell you I love
the sea, music, books, rain, storms, fire, blades, movies, comics/manga,
animation/anime, bad jokes, puns...  hahahahaha!!!  ;D
(Sorry, always laugh when I say "I love puns" because "puns" means "farts"
in Portuguese.  I don't like farts, hahaha!!!)
I love so many things...  Flowers, fruits, plants, animals, children,
watching stars and the moon, sleeping without nightmares, traveling,
knowing new places, visiting again the old ones...  I love breathing.  It
sounds fool, but breathing well makes me very very happy!  :D
I love walking around, meditation, learning new interesting things, being
alone...  I always loved being alone since I can remember.  I never feel
lonely, but it doesn't happen with everybody, I know, so I like to annoy my
friends too.  ;)
I love the complete absence of physical and emotional pains, but I don't
know a word to name it.  Maybe "peace"?  :)
I fall in love all the days.  A puppy asking to play, a kitten purring, a
new colorful flower, an interesting book, sweet people, kids playing,
lovely songs, a comfortable tree...  I like to hide myself in trees for
reading and eating their fruits, hahaha!!!  ;D
I love potable water, ear plugs, sleep masks, taking baths and showers, and
all the lovely smells.  I also love my teddy bear.  He was my Christmas
gift when I was 5 years old and he still sleeps with me.
Well, now you know almost everything about me.  :)
Good night, sweet dreams...  Take care and be well, please!  <3

PS:  - Just in case, I was not using stupid masks.  They were feeling bad
and, in some way, watching my face was comfortable to most of them,
specially the children.  They always think I am funny.
I gave up Criminology area when much younger, before ending the Law degree,
because of a kid's corpse.  It was fucking brutal watching it.  His father
should protect and love him, not kill him.  It was the second dead child of
my life and definitely it was enough, but had to watch more children
corpses in the last months.  And lots and lots of people older and younger
than me.
And, I ask pardon, but now I am completely sure that my life is a
disgraceful shit, but I do love it.  I do love being alive.  It's always
fucking interesting and my memories are part of who I am now.  My memories,
fears, and traums can be scary or sad, but are important part of my life.

in the end.  Hundreds of times in the last months.  Literally.  I got more
2 deaths today - number 199 and 200 - and decided it was enough.  I am
feeling dead.
Yep, my body's answer to viruses can be very fun.  This one, for example,
will never kill me.  Sorry, already tasted stronger flavours.  Not a
pleasent experience, of course.  My blood was and is being used in medical
researches and it is a bit annoying.  Gave researches some samples, gave a
friend a donation - cancer, 500 ml - and, well, already did it before two
weeks ago, donating blood to a public hospital.  So, I seem dead too.  Pale
and cold.
Well, there are dozens, and dozens, and more dozens of lovely cute
survivors too.  But they are wasted like me.
Now, I ask apologies to the whole list.  I did a lot of stupid noise here
in the last days because I am a stupid OT person with an stupid OT life.
And because I wanted desperately to annoy 2  (or more, don't know,
whatever)  stalkers.
Uncomfortable sensation, I needed help, sorry.  One of them is deeply _out_
my life, so I am less stressed and will try to sleep.  And eating _decent_
choco because I need to celebrate my f* luck.  Sh*t, it seems so wrong and
immoral doing it today, but...  well, the future can be cancelled still
today...  or tomorrow...  or never...  who can know?
So, take care and try to be happy, boys and girls.  And after 7 July, I
absolutely recommend the "Plague Songs" album.  It's indecent, immoral,

Oh, the most disastrous operations in the history of spinal surgery...
W-O-W, loved it!  All I wanted to see before my pretty complex spinal
surgery, sweetie!  <3
Hahahahaha!!!  ;D
Mirimir, I do love you.  You and my doctor always think I am a very
rational creature, able to analyze creepy situations with cold blood,
hahahaha!!!  Nobody else in this world would believe it, hahahahaha!!!  ;D
I do care a lot about a neurosurgeon  - he used to be one of my best
friends before his marriage -  and the innocent surgeon who thinks I am a
rational person.  Sweet boy.
My best friend for years and years was an addicted doctor, Mirimir.  That's
the reason why I learned a bit about chemicals, my love.  He committed
suicide and my world became stranger than ever for a considerable time.
You know I do hate lies and labels, but I was "his sweet high school
girlfriend" in public.  In real private life, he was gay and had more
boyfriends than me and all my friends together.  But you know, he was a
successful doctor and needed a perfect image: - white, male, hetero...  He
was buried using an Armani suit and red roses, our favorite flowers.  I
still love him and miss this fucking bitch a lot.
Hahahaha!!!  _He_ is a fucking _amazing_ surgeon!!!  I made some specific
researches about him.  :D
Don't feel jealous, my love.  I think _he_ has the _same_ preferences than
me in several areas.  Well, never asked about it.  Sorry, he is the guy who
will put his hands in my spine, not necessarily in my back.  ;)
(There will be a scar, but he will try to preserve my tattoo.)
He is a spinal surgeon, darling.  And I didn't tell my parents I can die or
become paraplegic after the last surgery.  I just want to be a butterfly
again and get my freedom back.
I was an hyperactive child and was banned of schools because of it.  I love
to walk for hours while thinking about a new idea or a problem.  Can you
mesure the deep intensity of my fear of losing my movements?   :((
I was shocked.  At same time, he gave me an answer and new perspectives.  I
wanted it more than everything at that point.  Certainly, it was not a good
answer, but I had finally a rational justification for the strong pains
able to make me fainting, able to make my lovely always low blood pressure
becoming crazily high in some moments...
My body was/is so fucking healthy that most of doctors simply said it was
stress, maybe psychological pain...  Sorry, my body and I never were needy
enough for pretending to be sick for getting attention.  And, well, I do
love my body.  It survived to real sick shit and is keeping me alive very,
very well.  Amazing healing capacity, wow...
Something was wrong and now I know what is and it makes me pretty happy.  I
can't fix it by myself, but life is funnier than ever because I know I
won't die:  I will run on beaches again, watching the sea and the sun
rising, darling.
(I just need to win a judicial battle first...  'Meh' things, you know.  I
am wasting my precious time with bureaucracy, aff...)

Oh, sorry, my fault!  Never remember to use filters or photo programs to
make me look me desperately miserable.  This is the reason I like this
pic.  It's just me and a Totoro hat.
Devastating physical pain and considerable emotional pain too.  It hurts,
it is frustrating when, after years trying to discover what is happening
with your body, you finally receive an answer, and do need to fight against
the State and the private health plan you contracted a decade ago and is f*
expensive.  Just for economic reference, I could use this money for
visiting you once a month before all the COVID-19 stuff.
At least, I do love my lawyer.  When I look to the mirror, she still smiles
to me, even working for free.  I am an egocentric bastard and I still
remember how life is sweet when you don't feel any pain.  First, I will get
the freedom back for me.  After it, without pain, I will try to get the
same sweet sensation for other people.  Nobody deserves to feel pain and/or
fear, darling.
In the moment, I am not a so good writer like I used to be and it's pretty
scary for me.  In the last three months, my doctor and I tried several
medicines for avoiding the extreme levels of pain, but the chemicals make
my writing so... hmm...  meh!  :-/
And there are stupid mistakes, specially in French, because I learn a
language using its sounds first, not its writing...  Or, at least, try to
do it.  Sorry, my fault, I know I am a disaster with all languages, in
special German Sauerkraut recipes!  My last try exploded in the kitchen a
few days ago and my nose is still screaming, full of horror...  :-/
(Do you remember my past Sauerkraut disasters, Mirimir?  Tor-Talk list
before being kickbanned, for example, hahahaha!!)
So, I prefer the pain and a, more or less, decent writing in Brazilian
Portuguese, my native language, even being slower.  My English always
stinks, with or without pain, so no considerable problem.
I just need time and patience for learning a bit more about Medicine.

heart wanted to believe again in a lovely merciful God...  the God of my
early childhood, able to give me rains, rainbows, and saving my friends...
Probably just one of my imaginary friends, less interesting than Mirimir or
Psychological pathology or not, the hysterical behavior and the panic of
some people is certainly collaborating to government's data manipulation,
to the complete lack of our privacy in name of a "greater good", and to the
strategical elimination of specific persons.
Please, stop crying for pretending to be a good person and do something
really useful for this world.  Stop governments.  It will be millions of
times more useful than donating your ear and a mask to someone.

I thank you very much, but don't worry so much.  The guy is bored and
trying to start a flame war at any cost.  He doesn't deserve your efforts.
You know, too much talk, but no much practical intelligence, or he would be
working in the weak points that coderman pointed us before, instead of
making this little show.
I think you will really appreciate Mirimir's messages, even the technical
ones.  He is my best "imaginary friend", one of the most comfortable
persons of this world.  I do love him very much.
Take care, be well.  Kisses and hugs, dear.  <3

Do you know why I respect him much more than ZH?  :-/
James is intelligent and has an elegant writing.  Even when saying the most
horrible things, the most detestable lies, or offending me in a pretty
nasty way, he keeps interesting...  and it means he is f* dangerous, a
person to fear, not a simple boring clown without a soul like ZH and  - of
course! -  all his fake hysterically profiles and/or messages.
J, I do love you.  I know you can hate me forever for saying it publicly,
but it is a way of giving free counseling to Karl and other lost people
here.  They need to learn how to identify the  - "absence of", maybe? -
"heart" behind the masks, hidden for polite words.

My dear Karl,
Please, calm your heart and breath slowly, darling.  Everything is okay
with the list archives and I've been receiving all your messages to the CP
list.  Believe me, each one of them.  Why do you think I was complaining
about your emails?  Hahaha!!  ;D
You do _not_ need to copy anyone to your answers, but you can copy me if it
makes you feel more comfortable, more secure and warm in this moment.  <3
Just relax and be calm, please.  There is life outside, out the lists, out
the blockchains, out the Internet.  This list is strangely cute and I also
love it, but try to get some fresh air.  It will be healthy for you, dear.
Greg is a very lovely person and pretty, pretty busy.  He donates a lot of
time and patience for managing this list adequately and I admire him really
a lot.  I don't know what happened about your message, but don't be
annoyed, everything is alright.  Nothing personal, nothing for losing your
sleep or wasting your time creating crazy conspiracy theories, please...  :P
Well, I will be silent, trying to sleep.  Sorry, I am always trying to
sleep because I have a very brutal insomnia, and I am happier when I have
water, food, and sleep.  Choose wisely your priorities in the life,
darling.  Without enough sleep, my bad mood is epic!  Without Internet,
it's even worse!  I seem a furious devastating monster, grrr...
Hahahaha!!  ;D
Tender kisses!!!  Take care and be well, please.  <3

Hey, charming hazel-green eyes...  The girl who will cook for you is an

worry.  :)
Do not judge anyone so badly, please.  Markos is a really good person, but
English is not his first language and some of his ideas about the use of
natural resources are not considered usual even here, in our country.
Let me tell you a little tale about a very, very sweet guy named...  I
don't know, uh...  David.  Let's see...  I think he is French...  and is
traveling!  ;)
Some time ago, I was telling him a little about my "best imaginary friend"
Mirimir and David's reaction was more adorable than Keanu Reeves playing
with puppies...  I had no time to explain him that Mirimir is a real
person, an Info Security guy using a fake persona for hiding his real data.
David thought I was feeling very sad having an "imaginary friend" as my
bestie and asked for being my Mirimir, a real Mirimir, giving me support
and making me smile in sad moments...  It was so unexpected and so sweet
that I cried for hours that night and I still cry when I tell this
story...  He was feeling hurt and fragile, but wanted to protect me from
sadness and loneliness...  :')
I do love my Mirimir, but I have other imaginary friends and also real
friends.  And now, I have my David!  <3
So, my lovely hellekin, give Markos a chance.  Human beings are very, very
complex...  Too much!  :P
I love you very much.  Always take care and be well, please!  <3
Oh, the same to the whole list!  Much love, peace, sincere friendship, and
music!!!  <3  <3  <3

Your bad mood is epic, grarpamp.  I love you even when complaining about
the end of world.  I will be there, I promise you, maybe holding you hand.
For now, take three tender little kisses  - muah, muah, muah! -  and this
joke, and smile for me, please  :)

Konnichihuahua!"  :D
I like this another joke a lot, but it is a bit Atheist...  ;)
