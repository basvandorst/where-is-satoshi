So this is big. This doesn't just break collision resistance, it
breaks second preimage resistance. Is that right?

Absolutely. I'd add that while it's *currently* hard to
read at a distance, passports typically have a lifetime
of 10 years and I'd be very surprised if the technology
wasn't significantly better five years out.

I haven't read the original paper, and I have a great deal of
respect for Markus Jakobsson. However, techniques that establish
that the parties share a weak secret without leaking that secret
have been around for years -- Bellovin and Merritt's DH-EKE,
David Jablon's SPEKE. And they don't require either party to
send the password itself at the end.
