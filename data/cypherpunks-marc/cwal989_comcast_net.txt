You can believe what you will, but much of the GNU/Linux and *BSD community has known about this vulnerability for 2 years.

Read the site:
They said it - and so did the OpenSSL community.

It seems no one wants to talk or hear about this issue.  It is not being reported on media sites or anywhere else, other than the Heartbleed site, and the OpenSSL lists.
This bug has been a known issue for about 2 years, and we are only now learning about it.  Not from banking, credit card, or shopping sites, nor from most news sites (the reports I've seen on news sites tend to downplay the scope and severity of the problem altogether, or simply say, "It's fixed").  Saying "it's fixed", is far from true.
It makes me wonder if the NSA was involved in inserting this bug into OpenSSL clients and servers.
