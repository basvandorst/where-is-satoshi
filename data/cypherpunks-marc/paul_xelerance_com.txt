So you can do HWRNG -> SWRNG -> Fips ?
Which is what you should do anyway, in case of a hardware failure. I
know the Linux intel-rng and amd-rng used to produce nice series of
zeros. The padlock rng has never produced warnings piping it through
With every phone doing crypto these days, I'd think you are wrong. Also,
the VIA PadLock already ships with an HWRNG on die. It's been shipping
for years.

I love how they pretend to be the first ones with this, totally ignoring others
who have had this for years, such as the VIA PadLock.
The article lists NIST having done tests, but does not mention any CPU model where
this is on. Anyone knows?
