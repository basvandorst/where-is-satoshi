Another fairly important point to it - a US company also has every right
to limit what you can say with their service (by AUPs, etc) in the contract
you sign to obtain service. Censorship beyond this is a matter of breach,
rather than First Amendment rights. Just as you are not guaranteed any sort
of audience, you also aren't guaranteed a podium from which to speak, in
most cases (there are certain specific exceptions to this, of course).
IANAL, of course. File complaints with the relevant RFC-specified addresses
at the carrier, if you believe it to be in violation of their AUP, or in
criminal violation of libel laws (please note that slander is only spoken,
not written, and libel has a fairly specific definition; if you don't know,
you shouldn't be claiming this without retaining legal counsel, yadda yadda
