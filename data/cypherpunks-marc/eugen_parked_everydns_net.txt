That's how Opportunistic Encryption (OE) is supposed to work. It's just it's
much too high-threshold for Joe Schmoe systems. Software firewalls are not
NATed, and increasingly cheap NAT allows IPsec tunnelling; at least
What is wrong which just exchanging the keys for ad hoc mode? You could cache
them and log whenever a key has changed (at least allowing to detect a MITM
post facto). We're really looking for blanket rollout of a low-security
service which wouldn't stand a dedicated attacker yet would effectively
prevent large-scale screening of cleartext traffic as currently practised by
diverse TLAs.
You can always upgrade to higher paranoia layers (like web of trust, or
direct exchange of secrets), but right now the entire
traffic is open to sniffing and filtering at will. It's a disgrace.
