@_subject: For Your Attn. 
Dear Sir,
This letter might come as a surprise to you, especially since you might not have had any business dealings in this part of the world. I am aware that I should have communicated the proposed matter through a more confidential means, kindly pardon me. My name is Joseph M. Tailor. I am the Terminal Supervisor for Securecorp Limited here in London  England. I have a very confidential business proposition that I seek your assistance in concluding. On January 6, 2002, a Liberian government official with the Ministry of Energy and Mines in the Republic of Liberia contacted our security company for the safekeepings of some family valuable and confidential documents.  On March 18th, 2002 he shipped through a diplomatic courier company, two Amarsafe Trunk boxes to us at Securecorp Limited. The consignment was valued at over $9,798,500.00. When the collection date approached as scheduled for March 2004, we tried to contact the depositor but we received no respond.
Last month, I was sent to Liberia to seek the official through the Ministry and that was when I discovered that he had been killed on September 15, 2002 in a car accident. Since my return, I have been able to convince the Directors of my company not to return the boxes to the new Liberian Government, as it had appeared that they knew nothing about the consignments or its contents. We then decided to open both boxes and to our utmost shock, there were Diamonds, which we believe is worth over US$100 million and an estimated cash of over US$98 million. Our intention then is to claim these boxes and have the funds transferred out of Britain. To achieve this goal, we will prepare all relevant documents in your name and have the consignment shipped to you or any corporation you may nominate. You will stand as the beneficiary of the consignment. You will be paid US$8 million for your role. A reputable British law office will prepare all necessary documents.
If this is something that interest you, please kindly contact me via my personal and private email address : josephmtailor4 with your telephone, facsimile and contact address. This transaction will be executed with total transparency securing the safety of all parties involved. Yours Sincerely,                                                                Joseph M. Tailor.                                                         Terminal Supervisor        Securecorp (U.K) Limited
