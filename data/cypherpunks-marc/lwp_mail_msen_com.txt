What ever happened to that previous Tim May, who used to extol the virtues
of regular ASCII email and would twit those who sent messages in various
wierd whiz-bang formats ?  This new Tim May is obviously an imposter,
sending 2 copies of the same message within one email, encrufted in ways
that look like crap on my studiously obsolete MUA:
[ Snip body of message, first copy ]
[ Snip Tim's introductory comment ]
[  Snip 2nd copy of article ]
