I think (but could be wrong) that you can look at a bitcoin's history
and see who's given to whom and use that data to trace who the person
is, if they weren't careful. (Eg: if they bought from a bitcoin
exchange in the US which could have it's logs subpoenaed)
Anyways, those drugs have to get delivered somehow. I could see them
tracing it that way - old fashioned detective work.
Also there's the comedy option that Silk Road is a giant sting
operation. The FBI has infiltrated other illicit markets (mostly
carding forums).
I saw a talk by the FBI agent who was profiled in Poulsen's book. He's
not the most technical guy in the world, but he's _damn_ good at
undercover work. As in, he convinced a carder forum to change their
hosting to an FBI controlled server, where they then siphoned up IPs
and then went to Eastern Europe and worked with the local authorities
to have the main carders prosecuted.
