I do agree. The same here. I don't believe all German major Telcos are
NSA affiliated.

hi there,
 that's the point of view how German police and German Ministry of the
Interior would like to see the new data retention law interpreted. It might not
be the smarted idea for us to blindly take this for real. Don't panic and let's
wait how German jurisdiction decides in 2009.
Even I strongly support the idea of having the entry and exit node in different
countries, I've got no idea how to enforce it in real world. Information
collected from registries used for example by GeoIP don't mean anything.

would it be noticed if an adversary modifies Tor's source code in order
to report a fake observed bandwidth (a few KB), fake uptime data, and
Windows as OS to the directories? Probably nobody will notice even if
those relays carry a significant amount of traffic.

hi there,
would you mind to broaden your research covering blutmagie1-4? Its last
24h sustained bandwidth is higher than the cumulated bandwidth of all
torserversNet and PPrivCom relays.
Currently about 25% of all traffic reported by relays flagged as exit is
routed thru blutmagie (50090 KBytes/s of 191341 KBytes/s Tor network's
total). This doesn't trouble you?

yep, all four blutmagie nodes are running on a single quad core cpu. The
Tor application doesn't scale very well with the number of cores. Thus
starting multiple instances on a single piece of hardware is the
cheapest option to make use of a gigabit uplink.
