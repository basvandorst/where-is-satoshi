The focus on platform here is ridiculous; can someone explain how
platform of attacker or target is extremely relevant? Since when did
It implies their skillset.  Here's something I just saw that
says it better than I can...

The activity.
I'm not upset.  I'm pointing out what Steven Bellovin said in just a few words: "This strongly suggests that it's not their A-team..."  This is a technical mailing list where cutting edge stuff is discussed.  The compromise was not using cutting edge stuff and, so, is a big  for this list.
The report was mainly for reporters.  That's why they had
the omg sound byte bullet points at the top.  It's also
why they had to explain several low level things in detail.
That is a definite possibility.

The scary part is that so many things got hacked by a bunch of people
who made the totally noob mistake of launching all their attacks from
the same place....
This all seems to be noobie stuff.  There's nothing technically cool to see here.  All they do is spear phishing and, once the link is clicked, put in a backdoor that uses commonly available tools.  As I suspected earlier it's M$ against M$ only.  The downside is nontechnical folks in positions of power often have sensitive data on their computers, only know M$ and don't have the knowledge to don't click on that "bank" email.
Technically, it was 74 pages of yawn.  Don't waste your time unless you're interested in how they found out where the attack was originating from and how they tied it to the .cn gov't.

It was just an example :-) to point out the scale of developers vs operators.
It would be interesting, I suppose, to see what can massively parallel better.  brains or brawn :)  That's what I'm saying.
If this is done by m$ toolage only, as the report seems to say, on page 4, for example:
"817 of the 832 (98%) IP addresses logging into APT1 controlled systems using Remote Desktop resolved back to China."
Then they have missed the more interesting part of the puzzle,
I believe.
ps.  If you gottem both, well that's a whole other thingie.

You'd be surprised at how much better brains are than brawn on these things...  ;-)

IMO, if we stick to the document and they are organized in military style, then a person who collect information, should focus only on that particular phase. That person is an operator, he or she should not be keep busy remembering long CLI commands. The scope is to deliver ASAP.
bzzzzzt.  Wrong answer.  Please study more.  Next!

Please elaborate.  I didn't follow that.

They're not all available for m$.

Be sure to read the source:
I'm only part way through, but I find it hard to believe that only micro$loth computers are used as the attack OS.  Maybe I haven't gotten far enough through report to find the part where they use the *nix boxes?

There only options are to:
Disobey the law, unacceptable in my opinion
Close down services, noble but I need to eat and you probably want to keep getting email
Compromise your principles and obey the law, the path often choosen.
So, there's no choice except to get a 5-gallon bucket of gov't-ky
jelly and take it?  So many things come to mind on your flag-waving
emails, I can't think of what to say first.  And believe me, that's
not usual...  ;-)  After a while, you'll become raw and probably
change your mind.

Google is speeding up its initiative to encrypt all DC to DC traffic, as
this was suspected a short time ago.
This goes back to our conversation last June:
now $189K may not seem as 'big'!  ;-)
