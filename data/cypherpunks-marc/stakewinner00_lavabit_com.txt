@_subject: Getting started 
Hi, I'm 16 years old and I was searching in duckduckgo and Google for some material about cypherpunks but I not find nothing more than this mailing list and some deserted website.
If someone can give me some more information, I would be very grateful.
Sorry for my bad English and for the spam.
