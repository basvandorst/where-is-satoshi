him into doing an hour long InternetSeminar On Saturday Morning, December 8th.
Here is what some have had to say about David:
'I made $3,500 using David Skidmore's techniques after listening in on the TeleSeminar on November 8th.  Thank You TeleSeminarsrus.com' - John S., Part-
Time Trader, NC.

Here are some Challenges With Covered Calls:
*	You may have tried this strategy and failed. It is not your fault.  You were taught Covered Calls incorrectly.  You do not know the finer points of Covered Calls that can mean the difference between a 15% gain and a 12% loss per month!
*	You may have tried this strategy and lost a lot of money. By learning a couple of David's key money management techniques you will trim losses easily and naturally.
*	You may have been told lies about this strategy. Most of the traders that do Covered Calls lose big time, because they don't know what they don't *	You may have paid big money to a seminar company to teach it to you incorrectly. There are seminar guys that are out there teaching you the wrong way to do Covered Calls.  If you try to do Covered Calls their way you are almost 100% guaranteed to lose!  These guys shouldn't be allowed to teach you unless they have made the kind of money David has made with Covered Calls.
*	You may have been sucked in by this strategy because it doesn't involve any work and it can pay you big. Once you really learn how to do Covered Calls Davids way, you can make money and still have a life or job.
Here is what David Is Going To Be Covering:
1.  Stock Picking
2.  Stock Analysis  3.  Call and Premium Analysis

I caught up with Toni just after she broke her foot, so she couldn't run far.  I talked to Toni for 30 minutes and I knew immediately that this lady is genuinely interested in sharing her trading knowledge, experience, tips, techniques and tactics with serious individuals that want major results in their trading accounts, in a short amount of time.  Her commitment is even on her website it reads:  "My goal is to teach active traders and short term investors how to participate in the stock market safely and profitably, without losing their shirts, or blouses"..
