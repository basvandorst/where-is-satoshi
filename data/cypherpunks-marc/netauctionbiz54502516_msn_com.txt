What if.... you knew that a company like internet auction
 pioneer E-Bay was going MLM this week and for LESS THAN $40  you could be placed at the top of the program.
What if.... Over 4.5 million current customers were going to be  emailed about this ground breaking internet MLM and by taking  action now, you would be earning a monthly residual income on tens of thousands of current customers.
What if.... the company planned on making the transaction fees  for the AUCTION BIDS commissionable and that millions of  transactions would take place on a daily basis, and......
What if.... you had the opportunity to participate in the global  expansion of the company, and What if...there was NO large  financial risk (unless you consider $39.95 to get started and  $25 a month to be in bonus a large financial risk).
 WHAT WOULD YOU DO?  YOU CAN GET IN NOW OR GET IN LATER..........
      Our group is working together as a team so everyone gets       people on their team.  It is important to act quickly!
