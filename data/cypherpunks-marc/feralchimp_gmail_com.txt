New to the list, so I'm sorry if I missed it, but what was the evidence presented that RSA took a $10M payoff to make Dual EC DRBG the default in Crypto-C?

[snipped quoted text]
First, thanks for providing more insight into the decision here.
I guess my point was that it's a confluence of trust issues: user trust, business stakeholder trust, and technical/cryptographic trust.  And in part because it does matter what you think, relatively informed people have drawn strong and variable conclusions from the news that "Silent Circle ditched AES and SHA-2 in favor of Twofish and Skein."
[snipped interesting doctor analogy; Jeffrey's response to it was solid.]
I didn't mean marketing as a pejorative or as 'non-technical', but as a blend of brand signaling and (highly technical, in this case) product management in response to user demand.
To that, and on positioning Twofish/Skein as an "alternative":
- Did users of Silent Circle threaten to leave if you stuck with AES and SHA-2?
- Can users of Silent Circle choose to continue using AES and SHA-2?
While it may be easy to roll back this software change in the future, wouldn't switching back be even more problematic (signaling-wise) than switching away?
One of the biggest issues we're wrestling with, I think, is that the crypto community already decided that AES and SHA-2 are just fine.  From where implementors are sitting, it decided good and hard.  So what now?
a) Maybe some new process will re-validate AES and SHA-2.  The peer review will somehow get peer-ier or review-ier, and the "NSA has magic math" meme will suffer. - AND/OR -
b) Celebrity cryptographers will make pronouncements that will enjoy uptake among implementors and their trusted advisors.
The Silent Circle decision encourages "NSA has magic" thinking, and unintentionally promotes [b].
And maybe NSA does have anti-AES magic.  But if they do, we've seen zero evidence that they're using it.  Are they just rooting boxes, forcing people to give up private keys, and sabotaging RNGs as a smoke screen or performance optimization?  Interesting times.  Thanks again-

Aside from the curve change (and even there), this strikes me as a marketing message rather than an important technical choice. The message is "we react to a deeper class of threat than our users understand."
Fair enough, but I'd hardly stop using AES or the larger SHA-2 variants on the back of recent news. cryptography mailing list

Well said.  In perhaps-related ethics news:
RSA Conference is a separate entity from RSA, and (I believe) not a subsidiary or profit center for either RSA or EMC.  At this point, they're just unlucky enough to have hitched their branding to the most recognized name in the industry.
If it's wrong for RSA to take $10M to set a bad default in BSAFE, is it not MORE wrong to sell the federal government a 0day for a fraction of that price?  On that score, black/gray hats boycotting RSA are like H dealers who cry foul because their neighbors let their kids run with scissors.
By boycotting the show, one is essentially depriving others the opportunity to hear one's nuanced, well-informed ranting about crypto ethics in its preferred venue i.e. the various bars and seafood restaurants of SF.
As always, focusing inward is indicated all around.
