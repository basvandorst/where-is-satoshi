Keep questions on list for the benefit of others.
the immediate error is that you can't have a '-' in a module name. Just out of curiosity why aren't you just using the mozilla/firefox policies in refpolicy? you should be able to build the module (make mozilla.pp) and then insert it with semodule -i mozilla.pp

you probably meant to require xdm, proc, home_root and bin, like this
require {
    type xdm_t, proc_t, home_root_t, bin_t;
otherwise you are trying to declare them and they've already been declared in base.
However, in refpolicy you should never have to declare types since the interface calls you make will bring them in, requiring xdm_t manually is breaking the encapsulation around the xdm policy, you'll want to find an xdm interface call that does what you want.
