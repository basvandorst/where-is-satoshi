To answer your question: No, flood has no session cache and will
renegotiate SSL sessions for each new connection. However, multiple HTTP
requests can be pipelined over one connection (aka "keepalive").
Having a client-side session cache may be something we will want to
optionally include for flood, but it doesn't seem like something that is
totally legitimate for what flood is trying to do. If one were trying
to load test the capabilities of an SSL server to handle a number of
simulated users, then reusing the same SSL session would inaccuratly
skew those results.
Consider this particular user profile:
1. open keepalive session to fetch foo.html
2. optionally open up to 3 other keepalive connections and service all
   subrequests (images, etc) from foo.html over those pipelines.
3. pause some random amount of time (representative of real user interactions
   on the particular website).
4. Repeat at step 1. with a new URL linked from foo.html
Now run this in parllel 100 times with random staring times and maybe
shuffle the URLs around a little bit, and you've got essentially 100
simulated users concurrently accessing the site. (One might point out
that at one time only a few users may be simultanously transfering data,
but from the user's standpoint they are all fully interacting with
the website.)
It would make sense, from the standpoint of properly emulating a real
user, to cache the session used in one thread (aka "farmer") as it
iterates through the above loop. I'd like to see something like this
added to flood, but I can't volunteer to do it right now. Of course,
you or anyone else are welcome to submit patches. :)
