@_subject: ADV: I saw your ad 
Dear Fellow Marketer,
I happened across your (site -ad) on the web, and I thought you may be interested in this.
I received an email from a fellow named Tim M. telling me about a program with a new system of stacking free members in a group, and I would have a chance to upgrade ahead of the others. When one of those people upgraded, they would be in my residually paying downline!
I have had several negative experiences with network marketing in the past and had pretty much given up on them. I was intrigued by this new concept for getting people off to a quick start, and he said it was free to join with no obligation, so I signed up.
Just as he had said, it was totally free to sign up and so I started to check out the opportunity, kick the tires a little, you might say. I checked it out and I must tell you that I was impressed!
One of the hardest things about network marketing is getting that initial downline started so you can start to leverage their efforts. I found that this system of being able to jump ahead of a group of other free members by being the first to upgrade, was a great opportunity to get a fast start in my new home based business! I learned quickly that the help didnt stop there! This system is designed so that when I showed that I really wanted to build a solid residual income, I was helped more than ever! As I said earlier, I have been in programs before and for the first time I found one that works. A chance to make REAL MONEY on the net!
Remember Tim? He has achieved a $1500 residual check in four months time, and by following his examples I will be following him in his success!
So check it out for yourself! It really is totally freekick the tires a little for yourself, and see what we are all so excited about!
