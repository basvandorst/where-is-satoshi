G P Quit: A professor was giving a big test one day to his students. He handed out
all of the tests and went back to his desk to wait. Once the test was over
the students all handed the tests back in. The professor noticed that one of
the students had attached a $100 bill to his test with a note saying "A
dollar per  point." The next class the professor handed the tests back out.
This student got back his test and $64 change.
A guy walks into a post office one day to see a very well-dressed,
middle-aged, balding man standing at the counter methodically placing "Love"
stamps on a huge stack of bright pink envelopes. Each envelope has hearts
all over it. The man then takes out a perfume bottle and starts spraying
scent all over them. His curiosity getting the better of him, he goes up to
the balding man and asks him what he is doing. The man says "I'm sending out
1,000 Valentines cards signed, 'Guess who?'" "But why?" asks the man. "I'm a
divorce lawyer," the man replies.
