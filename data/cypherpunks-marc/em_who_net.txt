On the other hand it must be said that, if reputation really worked as we
would like, some sloppy and deservingly accident-prone Certification
Authorities would be out of business by now.

Not only in future. Here is one example of questionable traffic filtering
initiative that is already being taken: listening to zealots like Steve
Gibson(  ) some providers have started to
block IP packets with unexpected source IP addresses, in the assumption that
they might be spoofed for evil purposes. Apart from creating difficulties to
dual-homed systems (unless policy-based routing is used to send reply
packets to the appropriate feed, avoiding asymmetric routing), this also
blocks the operations of privacy enhancement services such as the late
"Triangle boy" (now discontinued by Safeweb, but that's another story).
[Moderator's note: I must strongly disagree. Egress filtering
throughout the internet is of critical importance in stopping many
classes of attacks, and generally hurts no one legitimate. If you are
multi-homed in the sense of having multiple IP blocks, send out the
packets via the same path they came in -- setting that up is
straightforward. (I in fact do that, so any claims that it isn't
straightforward are unlikely to be believed, at least by me.) --Perry]

Hmmm... I see that the new 4096-bit super-duper key, besides its own (which
doesn't prove much), only bears the signatures of the now revoked -as
potentially compromised- old keys 0x375AD924 and 0xEEE8CFF3, plus 0x06757D2D
(which turns out to be a 1024-bit DSA key) and 0x50C0FEA7 (a lowly 2048-bit
RSA legacy key)...
Are you really our Lucky, or the NSA proving our worst fears founded? ;-)

Further to Lucky's comments: in the last few days I have discussed keysize
issues with a few people on a couple of mailing lists, and I have
encountered a hostility to large keysizes of which, frankly, I don't
understand the reasons. On the client side at least, performance is not an
issue: PGP 7.0.3 with my new 4096-bit PGP key appears to be as snappy as it
was with 1024-bit keys, and the table at
 looks quite reassuring.
In particular, none of the naysayers explained me clearly why it should be
reasonable to use 256-bit ciphers like AES with 1024-bit PK keypairs. Even
before Bernstein's papers it was widely accepted that bruteforcing a 256-bit
cipher requires computing power equivalent to ~16Kbit RSA or DH keys (and
~~512-bit ECC keys). Given that a cipher protects only one session, but PK
protection extends to a large number of sessions, one would expect the PK
part to be engineered to be the _stronger_ link of a cryptosystem, not the
weaker. And if the reason for the 256 bits is the possible deployment,
sometimes in the future, of quantum computers, well in that case we should
stop using PK cryptography altogether.
What am I missing?

This raises an interesting legal issue. Should any loss from a mis-issued
cert arise to a party who trusted the "Equifax" brand name shown in the cert
chain, but doesn't know (or want to know) anything about Geotrust, who would
be liable?
(Yeah, I know, any liability is usually disclaimed away, but I mean: which
one of the two is supposed to represent the "trusted" thirt party?)
