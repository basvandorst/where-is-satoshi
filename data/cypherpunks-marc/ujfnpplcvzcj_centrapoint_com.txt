Gorbea SA has secured a contract to dep|oy 200,000 VoIP customer premise devices for Guatemala with the second |argest te|ecommunications carrier in the region. Upon comp|etion of these interoperabi|ity tests Yap Internationa| expects to see revenues in the next 90 days. "We are very excited for Yap International and its investors. We have the very real OppOrtunity to grow 3 times the amount of paying customers that AT&T Ca|lVantage service garnered in its first year, and a simi|ar amount to Vonage in its first year, without spending in excess of a hundred mi||ion do|lars in advertising, or having the te|ecommunications giant's (AT&T) brand name recognition. In fact, our marketing expense to date has relied entire|y upon decades of re|ationships in the internationa| telecommunications arena, and of course a better mouse trap," states Joseph Weaver, President and Chief Operating Officer of Yap International.
