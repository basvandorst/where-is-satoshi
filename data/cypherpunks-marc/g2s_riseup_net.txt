Meanwhile, Trump's multiple security faux-pas triggers call for House Representative Ted Lieu, a congressman from Los Angeles County, California, led fourteen other House Democrats on Friday in urging the House Government Oversight Committee to investigate "troubling reports" of President Donald Trump's apparently poor security practices and the potential danger to national security posed by themâincluding his continued use of an unsecured Android device to post to Twitter, discussion of sensitive information (including nuclear strategy) in the restaurant at his Mar-A-Lago resort, and leaving classified material unlocked while visitors were in the Oval Office.
In a letter to Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz and ranking  > Referring to the complex problem of cybersecurity, President Trump recently said in an interview, "Iâm not sure you have the kind of security that you need." We fully agreeâwhich is why we are writing to request that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hold a hearing into troubling reports that the President is jeopardizing national security by egregiously failing to implement commonsense security measures across the board, from using an insecure, consumer-grade Android smartphone to discussing nuclear strategy openly in a dining room at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. Cybersecurity experts universally agree that an ordinary Android smartphone, which the President is reportedly using despite repeated warnings from the Secret Service, can be easily hacked.
Lieu and the other signatories of the letter expressed concern that Trump's Android device, "most likely the Samsung Galaxy S3," is particularly vulnerable to attack, and that someone could alter the information the President viewed on itâwhich could "have a huge impact on his beliefs and actions."
They also feared that someone could gain control of his Twitter account, "causing disastrous consequences for global stability," or use it as a listening device to pick up sensitive conversations.
Also cited by the letter were photos from a recent White House visit by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich that showed a key still in the lock of a bag for classified material on Trump's desk. The photo was called out by Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico in this Twitter post:
Additionally, Lieu and the other representatives expressed concern over the continued use of outside e-mail accounts hosted by the Republican National Committee, and compliance with federal records law. "Reports indicate that a political e-mail system used by senior White House staff was hacked in December by a Russian intelligence agency, yet again raising the prospect of the White House being monitored or influenced by unfriendly powers," Lieu and the others wrote. Federal law requires that all e-mails for official business on an outside e-mail system be forwarded or copied into a government e-mail system within 20 days.
The letter calls for the Oversight Committee to look into whether the President is using an unsecured device, whether Trump and the White House staff have been properly briefed and trained on both information security and operational security, and if "the President and the Office of the President [can] ensure that there are no missing e-mails, communications, and technological exchangesâin other words, can they confirm they are not actively being monitored?"

@_subject: Swedish police featured in Fox News segment tell their story, and there IS NO "Crime Wave" 
AAMOF they were never even asked about Muslims at all:
âWeâve got to keep our country safe. You look at whatâs happening in Germany. You look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible.â
Trumps comments about Sweden during his rally in Melbourne, Florida, raised many questions, especially among Swedes who were quick to point out that nothing terror-related had happened in the country. The president later took to Twitter to clarify his statements, saying that he was referring to a segment on âTucker Carlson Tonightâ on Fox News. The segment featured the xenophobic filmmaker Ami Horowitz, maker of an alarmistic movie about Sweden. The movie, titled âStockholm Syndromeâ, blames immigration as a direct cause of violence and rioting.
Two Swedish police officers were interviewed in the film. Anders GÃ¶ranzon and Jacob EkstrÃ¶m answered questions about how weapons are becoming more accessible. Horowitz also asked the officers about how crime has spread through cities. But the police officers now say that their answers were taken out of context, and are very critical of how their comments were portrayed on Fox News âTucker Carlson Tonightâ. âI donât understand why we are a part of the segment. The interview was about something completely different to what Fox News and Horowitz were talking aboutâ, says Anders GÃ¶ranzon.
Why were you interviewed?
âIt was supposed to be about crime in high risk areas. Areas with high crime rates. There wasnât any focus on migration or immigrationâ.
How did you react to the news segment?
âWe donât stand behind it. It shocked us. He has edited the answers. We were answering completely different questions in the interview. This is bad journalism.â
Anders GÃ¶ranzon continues: âIt feels like hell. The real questions should be shown along with our answers. We donât own the rights to the film, but the end result is that we donât want to talk to journalists after this. We canât trust each other.â
Have you done anything to stop the news segment?
âWe just saw it. What can we do? One thing is talking to you. The excerpt they showed doesnât say anything, we answered a different question. We donât stand behind what he says. He is a madman.â
DN has tried to reach Mr. Ami Horowitz for a comment. On Sunday he published a statement on Facebook in regard to the reception of his report from Sweden: âI think every media outlet across the globe covering my interview with Tucker Carlson and attacking the President is missing the point. Sweden is under assault because of the open door policy to Islamic immigrationâ.

I can't believe I'm saying this, but it looks like Trump is actually making America great again.
Just look at the progress made since the election:
1. Unprecedented levels of ongoing civic engagement.
2. Millions of Americans now know who their state and federal representatives are without having to google.
3. Millions of Americans are exercising more. They're holding signs and marching every week.
4. Alec Baldwin is great again. Everyone's forgotten he's kind of a jerk.
5. The Postal Service is enjoying the influx cash due to stamps purchased by millions of people for letter and postcard campaigns.
6. Likewise, the pharmaceutical industry is enjoying record growth in sales of anti-depressants.
7. Millions of Americans now know how to call their elected officials and know exactly what to say to be effective.
8. Footage of town hall meetings is now entertaining.
9. Tens of millions of people are now correctly spelling words like emoluments, narcissist, fascist, misogynist, holocaust and cognitive 10. Everyone knows more about the rise of Hitler than they did last year.
11. Everyone knows more about legislation, branches of power and how checks and balances work.
12. Marginalized groups are experiencing a surge in white allies.
13. White people in record numbers have just learned that racism is not dead. (See 14. White people in record numbers also finally understand that Obamacare IS the Affordable Care Act.
15. Stephen Colbert's "Late Night" finally gained the elusive  spot in late night talk shows, and Seth Meyers is finding his footing as today's Jon Stewart.
16. "Mike Pence" has donated millions of dollars to Planned Parenthood since Nov. 9th.
17. Trump has succeeded where thousands of history teachers failed - now everybody knows who Frederick Douglass was.
18. Melissa FREAKING McCarthy.
19. Travel ban protesters put $24 million into ACLU coffers in just 48 hours, enabling them to hire 200 more attorneys. Lawyers are now heroes.
20. As people seek veracity in their news sources, respected news outlets are happily reporting a substantial increase in subscriptions, a boon to a struggling industry vital to our democracy.
21. Live streaming court cases and congressional sessions are now as popular as the Kardashians.
22. Massive cleanup of facebook friend lists.
23. People are reading classic literature again. Sales of George Orwell's "1984" increased by 10,000% after the inauguration. (Yes, that is true. 10,000%. 9th grade Lit teachers all over the country are now rock stars.)
24. More than ever before, Americans are aware that education is important. Like, super important.
25. Now, more than anytime in history, everyone believes that anyone can be President. Seriously, anyone.

Show me an MSM headline, with link to the article, or any copy from an MSM article and link, that claims Trump was specifically referring to terrorism. They knew very well he was discussing a non-existent crime wave and EVERYONE is still wondering what incident recently 'in Sweden' he was referring to, as is the Swedish government.
Maybe it's this one: Attack in Sweden by neo-Nazis on a refugee centre
The use of vague speech (allowing for plausible deniability) as a propaganda tool is well known and all the bs bloggers created with the 'terrorism' claim THEY created is diverting attention away from the fact that Trump was really making up a 'Swedish Refugee Crime Wave' claim that's just as much bullshit, and allows creeps like you to point away from the LIE he told, and idiots, alot like you, believe it.,.

H/t: Emptywheel:  and  New CIA guidelines set restrictions for incidentally collected intelligence on U.S. persons after 5 years
(Technology Advances Prompt Changes in CIA Collection Procedures)
Robert J. Eatinger, Jr., Former Senior Deputy General Counsel, CIA
In the final few days of the Obama Administration, CIA Director John Brennan, after consulting with the Director of National Intelligence, brought years of CIA and interagency efforts to a close by updating the CIAâs decades-old procedures for collecting, retaining, or disseminating information concerning United States (U.S.) persons.  These updated procedures are promulgated in a document entitled, Central Intelligence Agency Intelligence Activities: Procedures Approved by the Attorney General Pursuant to Executive Order 12333.  In a departure from the past, Director Brennan made these procedures available to the public on the CIAâs Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties webpage.
Before discussing those changes, it may be helpful to start with a basic understanding of the requirement for these procedures.
A few commentators have portrayed Executive Order 12333 as a sort of mysterious, open-ended authorization for U.S. intelligence agencies to engage in secret, questionable activities outside of any judicial or congressional oversight regime.  In other words, some have intimated that it is intended to facilitate and hide intelligence abuses.  It is, in fact, the opposite.  Its purpose is to avoid abuses.
Executive Order 12333 is the latest in a string of executive orders that began in 1976 when President Gerald Ford issued Executive Order 11905 in response to the findings and recommendations of congressional investigations into alleged abuses of Americansâ rights by U.S. intelligence agencies (frequently identified as the Church and Pike Committees).  Among the findings was that a fundamental flaw in the governance of the U.S. intelligence community permitted intelligence abuses. Executive Order 11905 defines the powers of each intelligence community entity, thereby limiting them.  It then imposes some limits on how those powers may be exercised.
Every President since has either promulgated his own executive order, or adopted or amended the existing order. Executive Order 12333, was issued in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan and significantly amended in 2008 by President George W. Bush.  None of these executive orders were classified and all were published in The Federal Register.
Executive Order 12333 sets the basic mission statement of the intelligence community, which includes following the law and respecting rights.  It requires the elements to collect reliable intelligence that provides the President and national leadership âwith the necessary information on which to base decisions concerning the development and conduct of foreign, defense, and economic policies, and the protection of United States national interests from foreign security threats.â Executive Order 12333 further directs the intelligence community to collect that intelligence using â[a]ll means, consistent with applicable Federal law and this order, and with full consideration of the rights of United States persons,â and reminds the community of its âsolemn obligation . . . to protect fully the legal rights of all United States persons, including freedoms, civil liberties, and privacy rights guaranteed by Federal law.â
Executive Order 12333 limits the types of and methods by which information concerning U.S. persons may be collected, retained, or disseminated.  It then authorizes elements to engage in such collection, retention, and dissemination only as permitted by procedures approved by the Attorney General. The Attorney General formally approved CIAâs 12333 Procedures on January 17, 2017.
The CIAâs 12333 Procedures supersede procedures that had been written in 1982 and sparingly updated since.  The changes made in the updated procedures reflect not only developments in U.S. law and policy, but also advances in collection methods due to changes in technology and privacy interests unforeseen in 1982, which did not contemplate the ubiquitous use of mobile phones, computers, and other digital media devices or evolving views of privacy and thus did not seek to address âbig dataâ or âbulkâ collection. Sections 5 and 6 in CIAâs 12333 Procedures contain procedures specifically addressed to these developments.  These sections also satisfy the requirements to create procedures that limit to five years the retention of any nonpublic telephone or electronic communication acquired without the consent of a person who is a party to the communication except in defined circumstances (Section 309).
Section 5 and 6 also contain new procedures to address privacy interests implicated by foreign intelligence collection methods required in a globally interconnected digital world that did not exist in 1982.  As the CIA Statement notes, in 1982, âa clandestine operation may have resulted in the CIA collecting a limited number of hard copy documents.  Today, in addition to traditional intelligence scenarios, a single storage device may contain the equivalent of millions of pages of information, hours of video, thousands of photos, or more.â  The dominance of the digital environment has resulted in circumstances in which foreign intelligence on terrorists, proliferators, and other foreign intelligence targets reside within data streams and digital repositories that also contain substantial volumes of information concerning U.S. persons.
In order to find the foreign intelligence information, however, intelligence agencies at times must capture the entire data stream or digital repository (âbulk collectionâ) because technical, practical, or operational realities do not permit targeted collection.  Such collection captures not only the information of intelligence value that the intelligence agency wants, but also the information concerning U.S. persons that the intelligence agency does not want.  In such cases, the U.S. person information in the bulk collection is considered to be âincidental collection,â because its acquisition was not the purpose of the collection operation.  While such incidentally acquired U.S. person information is presumed not to be of foreign intelligence interest or value, its residence on an intelligence agency server raises privacy concerns.  The Sections 5 and 6 procedures seek to address these concerns.
Section 5 protects privacy interests by establishing procedures to minimize the use of bulk collection to circumstances in which it is necessary and ensure proper audit, thereby seeking to prevent CIA from acquiring unwanted U.S. person information in the first place, except when necessary.  Section 5 requires the preparation of specific documentation prior to or as soon as practicable after any intelligence activity that results in bulk collection or acquires more information than the CIAâs can evaluate promptly, or qualifies for retention without individualized review.  The documentation must contain certain information necessary for identified senior officials to determine whether to approve the collection.
Assuming the collection has been determined to be permissible, Section 6 addresses privacy concerns by establishing handling requirements and retention limits for the portion of the bulk collection containing U.S. person information of no intelligence value or interest:  the unevaluated information.
Section 6 creates two different types of handling requirements for unevaluated information; one for âroutineâ handling and one for âexceptionalâ handling.  Exceptional handling requirements apply to intelligence collections either of nonpublic communications that were acquired without the consent of a party to the communication, or that are anticipated to contain U.S. person identifying information that is significant in volume, proportion, or sensitivity.  The exceptional requirements include segregating the unevaluated information, limiting access to CIA employees who receive special training, creating an auditable record of activity, and importantly, requiring such information to be destroyed no later than five years after collection, permitting extensions in limited circumstances.
The five-year limit in Section 6 is but one example of how specifics in the new procedures attempt to find the right balance of intelligence and privacy interests.  Each procedure involves an effort to find the right tradeoffs to allow lawful intelligence collection and protect privacy and civil liberty rights and interests. The tradeoff was between the risk to a loss in intelligence capabilities by destroying information at five years against the risk to compromising privacy interests by keeping the information longer.
Deleting all unevaluated information specifically concerning U.S. persons has little to no intelligence downside because intelligence agencies will never want or have reason to search their intelligence holdings.  The five-year period to destroy all unevaluated information, however, will remove not only information concerning U.S. persons but also any information potentially concerning valid intelligence targets, such as international terrorists, from the intelligence agencies holdings.  In this latter case, however, intelligence agencies will want and may have a reason to search its holdings for information on these targets. The deletion of that information could thus have an adverse intelligence impact, particularly on counterterrorism and counterproliferation intelligence reporting, as well as on the conduct of human intelligence operations, all of which are important activities of the CIA.
The CIA could be expected to search all of its holdings upon receiving intelligence identifying a previous unknown person as a suspected terrorist or proliferator.  Under the five-year retention period, when the CIA conducts the search, any unevaluated information on that person that may have been acquired during a bulk collection activity over five years ago will have been deleted; CIAâs search will not retrieve that information. Thus, CIA might gain an incomplete or misleading understanding of the individual, his place in a terrorist network, and his contacts.  Or, CIA may send intelligence officers to conduct dangerous human intelligence operations to collect information it once had.  The loss of five-year old information could also adversely impact the spotting, assessing, recruiting, and running of human sources.  Safe and effective source operations are enhanced by the amount of information available to CIA and the handling officer(s).  How often the five-year retention limit might result in a loss of important information is unknowable.
The five-year retention period in Section 6 was not set by the CIA, DNI, or Attorney General, however, it was set by Congress through Section 309.  Certainly, differing mission requirements among the individual intelligence community elements translate into differing retention needs.  Some intelligence entities likely could accomplish their mission and destroy unevaluated information in less than five years.  Others may need to retain information longer than five years.  Without question, the congressional intelligence committees sought and considered the input of the intelligence community entities before setting a retention limit. Congress has provided that intelligence agency heads may retain information longer than five years if the head determines a longer retention âis necessary to protect the national security of the United Statesâ and certifies in writing to the intelligence committees the reasons for that determination, the new retention period, the particular information to be retained; and the measures that will be taken to protect the privacy interests of U.S. persons and persons located inside the United States.
Given the uncertainties of adequately assessing the relative risks to intelligence operations and privacy, and the diversity of considerations among intelligence agencies, if a single retention period was to be imposed on the entire intelligence community, the right body to do so was the one comprised of the Peopleâs representatives: the Congress.

@_subject: Alex Jones apologizes for his role in promoting "Pizzagate" 
McClatchy passes on WaPo
Alex Jones, the conspiracy-loving media personality, apologized Friday
for his role in promoting "Pizzagate," the baseless viral story that a
Washington pizza restaurant was the locale of a child sex-abuse ring run
by Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta.
In a surprising and rare bit of backtracking, Jones posted a six-minute
video on his website, "InfoWars," in which he read a prepared statement
formally distancing himself and his site from what became a textbook
story of fake news run amok. He addressed his apology to James
Alefantis, the owner of Comet Ping Pong, the restaurant that was the
supposed locale of the alleged conspiracy last year.
"I made comments about Mr. Alefantis that in hindsight I regret, and for
which I apologize to him," Jones said. "We relied on third-party
accounts of alleged activities and conduct at the restaurant. We also
relied on accounts of [two] reporters who are no longer with us."
He added, "To my knowledge today, neither Mr. Alefantis nor his
restaurant Comet Ping Pong, were involved in any human trafficking as
was part of the theories about Pizzagate." The story, he said, "was
based upon what we now believe was an incorrect narrative."
Jones, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump during the presidential
campaign, offered no comment or apology to Clinton or Podesta for
outlandish statements about their alleged involvement in the abuse of
hundreds of children.
Jones didn't say what prompted his apology but it may have been
motivated by a letter Alefantis wrote to him in February. The letter
demands an apology and retraction for InfoWars' postings about
Pizzagate; it does not threaten legal action, but refers to what
Alefantis describes as "defaming" comments by InfoWars.
But the timing of Jones' apology suggests he was concerned about a
potential lawsuit. Under Texas law, the Austin-based Jones had to
retract or apologize for the stories by Friday - one full month after
receiving Alefantis' letter - to avoid exposing InfoWars to punitive
damages in a libel suit.
In a statement, Alefantis said, "I am pleased that Mr. Jones has
apologized and admitted that he and his employees repeatedly spread
falsehoods about me and my restaurant. I wish that he would have made
this admission and apology months ago. And his apology, while welcome,
does nothing to address the harm he and his company have done to me, my
business, and my community."
Alefantis' spokeswoman, Molly Levinson, said Friday that Alefantis and
his attorney "continue to evaluate our legal claims."
As the story spread, Alefantis and his employees received multiple death
threats. The rumors culminated in December when a North Carolina man,
Edgar Madisson Welch, came to the restaurant with a loaded assault rifle
and handgun in what he called an attempt to investigate the claims. He
fired the rifle several times while inside the restaurant, according to
court documents.
Welch coincidentally pleaded guilty on Friday to weapons and assault
charges in an agreement with federal prosecutors in the District.
InfoWars wasn't the principal progenitor of the false story. The story
spread primarily through such user-generated sites as Reddit and 4chan,
as well as through fake-news websites and social media.
But InfoWars played a role, publishing numerous articles and
commentaries that speculated about the alleged involvement of Clinton
and Podesta. Pizzagate was sparked by cryptic comments made by Podesta
in emails that were stolen and later released by WikiLeaks during the
Among the more damaging elements cited by Alefantis in his Feb. 22
letter was InfoWars' role in encouraging its followers "to go out and
investigate the 'Pizzagate' conspiracy theory, to come to my restaurant
and investigate lies."
In his statement, Alefantis noted, "We can all hope that Mr. Jones'
retreat is the beginning of a process to hold accountable the people who
motivated an armed gunman to travel across state lines and fire his
weapon in a family-friendly restaurant."

Sharing Rides, Hoarding Profits
by Darwin Bond-Graham
 =E2=80=9CDisruption=E2=80=9D is the zeitgeist of Silicon Valley=E2=80=99=
s tech industry,
especially in the realm of startups. The mythos goes like this: small
scrappy hackers with very little capital and a few computers can create
new business models that will topple older fossilized companies, even
whole industries. In the process the economy will become more efficient
and everyone will have more choices. We all win thanks to the new
Internet-enabled economy. That=E2=80=99s not at all what is happening in
reality, however.
The ideology of disruption goes back a long way in the annals theorizing
capitalism, but the current ideology really owes more to Clayton
Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor and devout Mormon who
has built his academic career on case studies of disruptors.
Christensen=E2=80=99s seminal 1998 article in the Harvard Business Review=
 on
disruption tells a story about dominant companies atop their industries
=E2=80=94Firestone, Xerox, IBM=E2=80=94 that were caught flat footed, and=
 in several
cases destroyed, by their smaller creative competitors. They failed to
innovate and grow beyond their core markets. They failed to recognize
the potential of a new technology that would make their existing
products and services obsolete. This has fidelity with the actual
history of American business.
Christensen, along with his son Matthew, manages a hedge fund that
purports to bet on disruptors and short the stock of bumbling giants.
Christensen also sponsors a think tank he named after himself, the
Christensen Institute, which, according to its web site is, =E2=80=9Cdedi=
to improving the world through disruptive innovation.=E2=80=9D
California=E2=80=99s tech entrepreneurs have embraced Christensenian disr=
The big case studies in tech that seem to confirm Christensen=E2=80=99s t=
are well known. Digital cameras destroyed film. Personal computers
displaced mainframes as the core hardware business, and laptops have
since eaten into a huge share of the personal computer market. Now
mobile devices are eroding PC sales. None was ever seen as a threat to
the existing dominant product and producer, but displacement happened
nonetheless. Tapes replaced vinyl, CDs replaced tapes, but MP3s and
iTunes-like services have replaced CDs. Cloud is displacing both the
idea of storing your data on physical drives you own. Software as a
service is chipping away at the idea of buying and owning software. And
so on=E2=80=A6
In a lot of cases disruption ends up being a battle of big corporations
for market share. Consumers and employees within the industry aren=E2=80=99=
necessarily better or worse off when the smoke clears and a winner
emerges with a new technology and business model.
But the tech boom today is characterized by a another kind of
disruption. It=E2=80=99s social disruption. New technologies and business=
 models
don=E2=80=99t just attack the existing dominant corporations; they attack=
 social
relations and transform non-business spheres of life into methodical
instances of economic exchange from which the new tech innovators
extract revenue. The tech boom is also characterized by disruption of
smaller competitive markets by emergent tech monopolists backed
ultimately by huge pools of private equity and giant, monopoly-seeking
The winners and losers in many cases of disruption are split along
existing racial and class lines of inequality. Those with little
economic or political power to defend themselves from the disruptors are
seeing their livelihoods and communities turned upside down. Their small
businesses are being destroyed. Their communities are becoming
unaffordable. Those with cultural capital, and access to economic
capital have a shot at being disruptive, at skimming some wealth off of
deregulated industry and precarious labor. And the wealthy individuals
and companies that should be disrupted by a clever tech startup =E2=80=94=
the tax
dodging banks, the Fortune 500, the health care companies and insurance
giants=E2=80=94 have the resources to defend themselves, fend off the gee=
deploy an equally clever response to retain market share, or to just
buyout the scrappy competitor and fold it into their existing empire.
The ridesharing phenomenon reflects all of this and more.
Ridesharing companies like Lyft, Uber, and Sidecar use the ubiquitous
ownership of smartphones to connect casual drivers and passenger clients
through their proprietary applications. Like any broker they take their
cut of the revenue in these transactions, (Lyft, for example, skims 20
percent off each payment made by a passenger through their smartphone.)
Ridesharing companies encourage unregulated, hyper-privatized
transactions among precarious laborers. Their business model relies on
marketizing formerly non-economic spheres of life, like giving a friend
a ride in your car, and they have aggressively externalized costs like
gas, insurance, payroll, etc. so that profits are maximized and expenses
are as close as possible to nonexistent. In doing so they undermine the
very existence of the taxi industry, but they also undermine public
infrastructure in toto.
Taxis are not just some private sector dinosaur that should be hit from
an innovation meteor. Taxis are an integral part of every major city=E2=80=
transportation infrastructure. Taxis have been strictly regulated to
ensure that the industry=E2=80=99s companies and contractor-drivers pay r=
into the city for the infrastructure they use: roads, signals, bridges,
signs, sidewalks, etc. In San Francisco taxis generate over ten million
dollars each year in revenue for the city to spend on maintaining
transport infrastructure. The funds also pay for the costs of regulating
the industry through the Taxi Commission. Regulators attempt to shape
the industry in important ways to make it more accessible and equitable
and therefore democratic. For example, San Francisco=E2=80=99s taxi fleet=
 is 85
percent hybrid or CNG fueled, reducing the fleet=E2=80=99s carbon emissio=
ns and
improving the health of city residents. This environmental standard is
only possible because the industry is regulated, and ridesharing
companies like Uber and Lyft undermine this effort. Taxis are also
required not to discriminate among passengers, and to serve all parts of
the city, among other things that might not be maximally profitable.
It=E2=80=99s this public transportation infrastructure, a big part of whi=
ch is
comprised of taxis, that is being disrupted by the ridesharing companies
who have inserted themselves as for-profit brokers in the transportation
The people who will lose the most from the unbridled rise of ridesharing
are those employed by the taxi industry which is seeing profits
disappear. San Francisco=E2=80=99s taxi industry is very decentralized an=
highly competitive. There are about 31 cab companies today served by 10
dispatch companies, some quite big and some very small. No single firm
is dominant. There are about 1,500 cabs authorized to drive within the
city. The taxi industry employees several thousand workers. Taxi drivers
are predominantly immigrants and people of color, and the average cabbie
earns a very low yearly income. In 2000 upwards of 57 percent of San
Francisco cab drivers were immigrants, with the largest groups having
arrived from South Asia, East Asia, Russia and Africa. Of the 1,540 taxi
drivers in the San Francisco, San Mateo, Redwood City metro region the
hourly mean wage last year was $14.17, and the annual mean income was a
mere $22,440.
When people say the taxi industry is =E2=80=9Cripe for disruption,=E2=80=9D=
 what they=E2=80=99re
saying, besides the real inefficiencies and problems affecting most big
city taxi operations, is that it is a decentralized, highly competitive
industry, most of whose owners and operators are low-income people of
color, many of who are immigrants. They are susceptible because they are
marginalized, and because they lack political and economic clout. In San
Francisco the cabbies are definitely a noisy political lobby, but up
against the tech and venture capital bosses and entrepreneurs, who are
most influential in the Mayor=E2=80=99s office, the cab drivers are impot=
That=E2=80=99s who is being disrupted, a competitive industry that is own=
ed by,
and which employes, working class people of color.
So who=E2=80=99s doing the disrupting? Who benefits from this attack on t=
he taxi
industry, and more generally on the principle of a regulated
transportation sector?
The two biggest ridesharing companies in San Francisco are Uber and
Lyft. Although they virtually didn=E2=80=99t exist until two years ago, b=
them they have raised about $390 million over the past 2 years according
to securities filings with the state and SEC. Uber and Lyft are quickly
expanding their ridesharing enterprises to New York, LA, Chicago, and
other cities far beyond the laboratory of San Francisco.
Where is this money coming from?
Uber=E2=80=99s financial backers include Goldman Sachs, Google Ventures, =
four other private equity groups. Perhaps Uber=E2=80=99s biggest financia=
backer is TPG Capital. Co-founder of TPG, David Bonderman, one of the
wealthiest men on earth, is now on Uber=E2=80=99s board of directors.
Bonderman=E2=80=99s personal net worth is somewhere in the ballpark of $2=
billion. TPG reportedly has $55 billion in funds under management making
it one of the largest private equity firms in the world.
Uber=E2=80=99s other investors like Menlo Ventures, Benchmark Capital, an=
d First
Round Capital are pretty typical of Silicon Valley=E2=80=99s private equi=
network. The firms are owned and run by mostly white men with Ivy League
college pedigrees, places like Stanford, Cornell, Harvard, Yale and
other bastions of privilege. The partners at these firms are
millionaires, and billionaires are not uncommon. They leverage pension
fund, university endowment, and sovereign wealth dollars to invest in
speculative ventures as well as established companies (and from their
limited partners they extract hefty management fees). To call them
members of the 1% would be inaccurate. Many of Silicon Valley=E2=80=99s p=
equity investors quality as bona fide members of the 0.1% due to the
enormous sums of wealth and income at their command. While most are
socially liberal, many of them make political investments with
influential Democratic and Republican members of Congress to ensure the
country=E2=80=99s tax code and business laws allow them maximally build t=
Lyft=E2=80=99s financial beneficiaries are similarly elite members of the=
economic hierarchy. Earlier this year Zimride, the ridesharing company
that developed Lyft, sold its Zimride ride-sharing application to
Enterprise Holdings for an undisclosed sum. (Zimride was the equivalent
of a combined craigslist ride-sharing bulletin board and Facebook.)
Enterprise Holdings is a giant global corporation that booked $15.4
billion in revenue last year. As a private corporation, Enterprise is
owned and controlled by the Taylor family of St. Louis. Jack Taylor, the
family=E2=80=99s patriarch, is reportedly worth $11 billion. The Enterpri=
acquisition of Zimride is an example of how powerful corporate interest
often respond to potential disruptors who might undermine their existing
product; they purchase them and integrate them into their larger
operations. In this case Enterprise, which peddles rental cars it owns,
saw Zimride as something that could disrupt their profit stream, so
Enterprise gobbled up the disruptor. The way Enterprise does business is
changing as a result, but the distribution of economic power isn=E2=80=99=
t shifting.
Zimride=E2=80=99s Lyft ridesharing product which directly competes with t=
companies and bigger competitors like Uber received $80 million this
year, mostly from the Andreessen Horowitz private equity firm. Again,
Andreessen Horowitz is about as wealthy and establishment as you can
imagine in American business. Marc Adreesseen, who half the firm is
named for, got rich from developing one of the first web browsers. From
the fortune he obtained doing that he invested in other big tech
companies and became wealthy. Today Andreessen is a director of HP and
Ebay, two Fortune 500 companies, as well as a director of Facebook.
Ben Horowitz (son of the arch-conservative David Horowitz) was a founder
of Opsware, a company Hewlett Packard bought for over a billion dollars
back in 2007. Andreessen was a funder of that company. Opsware was
possibly a disruptor to established tech companies like HP, so HP
devoured it.
Andreessen Horowitz manages probably upwards of $3 billion, and they
have dozens of investments. They=E2=80=99re major backers of other disrup=
tech startups like Airbnb and Udacity, two companies that are similar to
ridesharing in that they are threatening the welfare and livelihoods of
low-income communities.
Look across the other smaller ridesharing startups that are competing
for market share in this gold rush sector and you=E2=80=99ll see similar
stories, fast growing companies with very disruptive business plans
backed by very powerful investors. The people who=E2=80=99s lives will be=
 most
disrupted are going to be the less powerful working class who toil in
the competitive and disorganized taxi and other transit industries. The
public sector will be disrupted as it is partially privatized and as
regulations are undermined in favor of new rules that allow tech
companies to externalize costs as much as possible onto precarious
workers. More and more parts of our lives will be transformed into
relationships of market exchange. As San Francisco=E2=80=99s recent battl=
es over
ridesharing show, this is by no means a =E2=80=9Cnatural=E2=80=9D process=
=2E It=E2=80=99s
politically determined as to what kind of economy we want, and how the
rules of the economy will distribute wealth and income and provision for
public goods.

also demanded that travelers provide their passwords or log in their
social media accounts. Travelers who don=E2=80=99t comply face the threat=
 of
being denied entry.
Yesterday, Wikileaks publish a trove of leaked CIA documents including
knowledge of security vulnerabilities and exploits that the CIA paid for
and kept secret from the general public. Now that this information has
leaked, it=E2=80=99s no longer just the CIA that knows these
vulnerabilities=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s everyone. The New York Times and oth=
ers misreported
that the CIA had broken the encryption in apps like Signal and WhatsApp,
when in fact what the CIA did was target specific people=E2=80=99s Androi=
devices and compromise them.
In short, this revelation confirms the importance of using end-to-end
encrypted communications, which hinder state-level actors from
performing broad spectrum dragnet surveillance. E2EE is still important.
Limitations: Plaintext Endpoints
First, it=E2=80=99s important to understand that if you can read a messag=
e, it
is plaintext=E2=80=94that is, no longer encrypted. With end-to-end encryp=
the weak links in the security chain become you and your device, and
your recipient and their device. If your recipient can read your
message, anyone with access to their device can also read it. An
undercover cop could read your message over your recipient=E2=80=99s shou=
or the police could confiscate your recipient=E2=80=99s device and crack =
open. If there is any risk of either of these unfortunate events taking
place, you should think twice before sending anything you wouldn=E2=80=99=
t want
to share with the authorities.
This particular limitation is also relevant to the recent =E2=80=9CVault =
reveals, which demonstrate how apps like Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram
may not be useful if an adversary (like the CIA) gains physical access
to your device or your contact=E2=80=99s device and is able to unlock it.=
 Many
reports around Vault 7 have been somewhat misleading, giving the
impression that the apps themselves have been compromised. In this case,
the compromise is at the device level=E2=80=94at the endpoint. The encryp=
itself is still good.
Limitations: Targeted Surveillance
Considering that you can=E2=80=99t control the level of security of your
message=E2=80=99s recipient, you should consider the risk that any messag=
e you
send them might be read. While rare, there are cases of state powers
targeting people with direct surveillance. In these cases, targets may
be working with malware-infected devices intended to log all of their
incoming and outgoing communications. This compromise functions at the
endpoint level, rendering E2EE useless against these specific
adversaries. Because it is difficult to know whether you (or your
message recipient) are the target of this type of attack, it is always
best to default to not sending overly-sensitive information via digital
communications. Currently, such attacks appear to be rare, but one
should never take risks needlessly.
Limitations: Metadata
The third thing you should know about E2EE is that it doesn=E2=80=99t
necessarily protect your metadata. Depending on how communications are
transmitted, logs may still show the time and size of communication, as
well as the sender and recipient. Logs may also show the location of
both sender and recipient at the time of communication. While this is
not typically enough to land someone in jail on its own, it can be
useful in proving associations between people, establishing proximity to
crime scenes, and tracking communication patterns. All these pieces of
information are useful in establishing larger behavioral patterns in
cases of direct surveillance.
So=E2=80=A6 Why?
So, if end-to-end encryption doesn=E2=80=99t necessarily protect the cont=
ent of
your communications, and still gives up useful metadata, what=E2=80=99s t=
point of using it?
One of the most important things E2EE does is ensure that your data
never hits someone else=E2=80=99s servers in a readable form. Since end-t=
encryption starts from the moment you hit =E2=80=9Csend=E2=80=9D and pers=
ists until it
hits your recipient=E2=80=99s device, when a company=E2=80=94like Faceboo=
k=E2=80=94is subpoenaed
for your logged communications, they do not have any plaintext content
to give up. This puts the authorities in a position in which if they
wish to acquire the content of your communications, they are forced to
spend a significant amount of time and resources attempting to break the
encryption. In the United States, your right to a speedy trial may
render this evidence useless to prosecutors, who may not be able to
decrypt it quickly enough to please a judge.
Mass Surveillance
Another use of E2EE serves is to make dragnet surveillance by the
National Security Agency and other law enforcement agencies much more
difficult. Since there is no point in the middle at which your
unencrypted communications can be grabbed, what is grabbed instead is
the same encrypted blocks of text available by subpoena. Dragnet
surveillance is generally conducted by collecting any available data and
subjecting it to automated sorting rather than individual analysis. The
use of encryption prevents algorithmic sifting for content, thus making
this process much more difficult and generally not worthwhile.
In addition to NSA=E2=80=99s data collection, federal and state law enfor=
agencies around the country have, and frequently use, cell site
simulators known as =E2=80=9CIMSI catchers=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CStingrays=
=2E=E2=80=9D IMSI catchers
pretend to be cell towers in order to trick your phone into giving up
identifying information, including your location. Cell site simulators
also grab and log your communications. As with other methods of
interception, encryption means that what is retrieved is largely
useless, unless the law enforcement agency is willing to go to the
trouble to decrypt it.
Encryption At Rest
In addition to using end-to-end encryption to protect the content of
your messages while they=E2=80=99re being sent, you can use full-disk enc=
to protect your information while it=E2=80=99s stored on your device. Pro=
full-disk encryption means that all of the information on your device is
indecipherable without your encryption key (usually a passphrase),
creating a hardened endpoint which is much more difficult to compromise.
Although encrypting your endpoints is not necessarily protection against
some of the more insidious methods of surveillance, such as malware, it
can prevent adversaries who gain possession of your devices from pulling
any useful data off of them.
End-to-end encryption is by no means a magical shield against
surveillance by nation states or malicious individuals, but Vault 7
highlights how using it can help force a procedural shift from dragnet
surveillance to resource-intensive targeted attacks. When paired with
good sense, encrypted devices, and other security practices, E2EE can be
a powerful tool for significantly reducing your attack surface.
Consistent, habitual use of end-to-end encryption can nullify many
lower-tier threats and may even cause some higher-level adversaries to
decide that attacking you is simply not worth the effort.

@_subject: A new meaning to "Intertubz" (sub [snigger] head, The Internet of [ahem] 'Thangs') 
A "smart condom" that "tracks thrust speed and velocity and lets you
share the data."=20
"It's basically a Fitbit for your man bits..."
 The i.Con Smart Condom, which markets itself as the "world's first
smart condom," is actually a ring that fits over a boring, dumb condom
and claims to track the exercise of your man bits, as well as detect
chlamydia and syphilis.
The ring, first announced last July, is currently available for preorder
on British Condoms for =C2=A359.99 (about $74, AU$97) with an unknown rel=
date. But you can't actually put a ring on it yet -- the company says it
won't take your money until the product has a firm release.
In short, the i.Con ring promises to answer every burning question
you've ever had about your sex session. Don't worry, it will pair with
an app for all your data visualization needs.
According to the preorder page, the ring will answer questions such as:
    What's my thrust velocity?
    How fast are my thrusts?
    How many calories did that sesh just burn?
    How many times did I just have sex?
    What's the average skin temperature of my... eggplant?
    What's my girth?
    How many different positions did I just conquer?
Plus, it aims to answer that age-old question: How do I stack up at sex
to everyone else around the world? Because sure, let's gamify sex. What
could go wrong?
The ring, which will come with a one-year warranty, will have a
Micro-USB charging port to provide six to eight hours of "live" usage
(not clear if this means thrust usage or something else). It will work
with a combination of "nano-chip and sensors," and pair with your device
via Bluetooth. (I thought it would charge kinetically, but maybe that's
just a pipe dream.)
With zero pictures of the self-styled "future of wearable technology in
the bedroom" on the site, it's hard to say just how all this technology
will fit into a tiny ring. The company did not immediately respond to a
request for comment. British Condoms does say the i.Con will be
available in one size with a "band adjustment feature."
Worried about privacy, the data kind? British Condoms says "all data
will be kept anonymous, but users will have the option to share their
recent data with friends, or, indeed the world."
Forget dick pics. Now we have to worry about dick status updates.

@_subject: eBook (pdf) Cities Under Siege: The New Military Urbanism - Libcom 
A "Psychogeographical look at the ever increasing encroachment of
militarism and high tech surveillance into urban areas."
"Cities Under Siege comprises three broad, thematic chapters, followed
 by seven extended case studies.
 The first of the thematic chapters looks at how warfare, political
 violence and military and security imaginaries are now re-entering
 cities. This development follows a long period when Western military
 thought was preoccupied with planning globe-straddling nuclear
 exchanges between superpowers or massed tank engagements across rural
 plains. It examines, too, the ways in which the latest military and
 security doctrine is working to colonize the everyday environments of
 modern conurbations.
 Chapter 2 moves on to look at how the various bastions of the
 political right increasingly work to demonize cities as intrinsically
 threatening or problematic places necessitating political violence,
 militarized control, or radical securitization.
 In Chapter 3, I detail the particular characteristics of the new
 military urbanism, and use some of the latest research in the social
 sciences to highlight key features of the deep ening crossover between
 urbanism and militarism.
 The next six case studies address the circuits through which the new
 military urbanism connects urban life in the West to existence on
 colonial frontiers. The first three look at, respectively, the
 proliferation of borders and surveillance systems within the fabric of
 urban life; the US military's ambitions for urban and
 counterinsurgency warfare based on the deployment of armed robots; and
 the connections between entertainment, simulation and US military and
 imperial violence.
 The final three explore the diffusion of Israeli technology and
 doctrine in urban warfare and securitization; the links between urban
 infrastructure and contemporary political violence; and the ways in
 which Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) culture is embedded within a
 geopolitical and political- economic setting that links domestic and
 colonial cities and spaces.

Because anything worth saying to me offlist is worth putting on the
list, ESPECIALLY when it's trollbait.
YOU live in an altered reality far beyond anyone who pokes smot.
    Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg is the founder, CEO, and owner of
Bloomberg L.P., the financial software, data, and media giant. As
three-term mayor of New York City, he presided over tens of thousands of
small-time pot busts, despite having famously answered a question about
smoking pot with: "You bet I did, and I enjoyed it." NORML used those
remarks as the basis for a full-page ad in the New York Times and ads on
city buses, prompting Bloomberg to say he regretted those remarks, and
that he was "a believer that we should enforce the laws, and I do not
think that decriminalizing marijuana is a good idea."
    Richard Branson. The afore-mentioned Branson not only wants to
invest in marijuana, he says he smokes it with his adult son. In a 2007
interview with GQ, he told Piers Morgan as much, saying father and son
had lit up during an Australian beach vacation. In that same interview,
Branson revealed that he had learned the art of joint-rolling from none
other than Rolling Stone Keith Richards, who should know how it's done.
    Hugh Hefner. The Playboy magazine founder and octogenarian serial
monogamist deserves kudos for being the first businessman to get behind
pot legalization, donating $5,000 to help found NORML in 1970. Hef is
still sticking to that position: =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t think there=E2=80=
=99s any question
that marijuana should be legalized because to not legalize it, we=E2=80=99=

But it
wasn't just politics; Hefner liked what pot did for him:  =E2=80=9CSmokin=

Anderson, author of High in America. =E2=80=9CI discovered a whole other
dimension to sex.=E2=80=9D
    Mark Johnson. Johnson may not be as well-known as some other names
on this list, but he is the CEO and founder of Descartes Labs, a New
Mexico-based tech company, and before that, he was CEO of Zite, a
Silicon Valley personalized news streaming company. Back in his Zite
days, he told Bloomberg News he was a full-on stoner, toking up day in
and day out, and that so many other tech workers were, too, that it was
not an issue. =E2=80=9CPeople just don=E2=80=99t care,=E2=80=9D Johnson s=

    Peter Lewis. Lewis was CEO of Progressive Insurance from the 1960s
to his retirement in 2000, and served as chairman until his death in
2013. He was also "a functioning pot head" who used weed for both fun
and relief from chronic pain from a leg amputation in 1998.
    John Sperling. The University of Phoenix CEO died last year at age
93, but not before publicly acknowledging that he smoked marijuana
manage the side effects of the treatment he received for prostate
cancer. He, Lewis, and George Soros were the original troika of
deep-pocketed marijuana reform businessmen; now only Soros is left,
although Lewis's estate continues to invest in legalization efforts.
    Oprah Winfrey. The iconic Oprah isn't on TV anymore, but she' worth
$3 billion and she's still the chairwoman and CEO of both Harpo
Productions and the Oprah Winfrey Network, where she's also CCO. She has
never staked out a position on marijuana legalization, but she has twice
said she smoked it, although not for a long time. She told "Watch What
Happens: Live" in 2013 that she had last smoked in 1982, and she told
"The Late Show With David Letterman" earlier this year that she hadn't
"smoked weed in 30 years."
    George Zimmer. The founder and recently ousted CEO of Men's
Wearhouse is an unabashed pot smoker, as well as a financial backer of
legalization efforts. Just a couple of weeks ago he told CNBC that he=E2=80=
=E2=80=9Cbeen smoking marijuana on a regular basis for about 50 years.=E2=

not take it easy after his 2013 firing, either: He has since gone on to

Often straddling a line between journalist and participant, Brown's rise
to prominence tracks that of the hacker collective Anonymous, perhaps
best remembered for its campaigns against Scientology. Media outlets
characterized Brown, not always entirely to his liking, as the spokesman
for Anonymous, and it would be his association with hackers that would
later put Brown on the FBI's radar.
For his part, Brown believes that it was his investigation into several
private intelligence contractors following the hack of a firm called HB
Gary. Brown and his team discovered in the emails that several of the
firms had joined together into a conglomerate called Team Themis, and
that one of Team Themis' projects was to develop potential lines of
attack against critical organizations like Wikileaks and journalists
such as Glenn Greenwald.
Brown sat down with Reason TV in the Dallas headquarters of D Magazine,
where he now works covering city council meetings, to talk about life in
federal prison, the state of the private intelligence industry, what an
ever-leakier world means for the future of U.S. politics and culture,
and his plans to create a decentralized activism network based on
lessons learned from Anonymous meant to shake up media and governmental

This article

Snowden papers fell in his lap, so it would seem he just doesn't need
the money that much to swing in his hammock down in Brasil, and he was
the founding partner of a law firm, not a cheap proposition, so his

After all, that's so much simpler than refusing to be Airstrip One for
the US Empire.
UK: Attacker used WhatsApp, firm must help police get access
Mar. 26, 2017 | 05:28 PM
Associated Press via Lebanon Daily Star
LONDON: Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood sent a WhatsApp
message that cannot be accessed because it was encrypted by the popular
messaging service, a top British security official said Sunday.
British press reports suggest Masood used the easily available messaging
service just minutes before starting a rampage Wednesday that left three
pedestrians and one police officer dead and dozens more wounded,
including some with catastrophic injuries.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd used appearances on BBC and Sky News to urge
WhatsApp and other encrypted services to make their platforms accessible
to intelligence services and police trying to carrying out lawful
"We need to make sure that organizations like WhatsApp - and there are
plenty of others like that - don't provide a secret place for terrorists
to communicate with each other," she said.
Rudd did not provide any details about Masood's use of WhatsApp, saying
only "this terrorist sent a WhatsApp message and it can't be accessed."
But her call for a "back door" system to allow authorities to access
information is likely to be met with resistance throughout the industry.
In the United States, Apple fought the FBI's request for the passcodes
needed to unlock an iPhone that had been used by one of the perpetrators
in the 2015 extremist attack on San Bernardino, California.
Masood drove a rented SUV into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before
smashing it into Parliament's gates and rushing onto the grounds, where
he stabbed a policeman to death before he was shot dead. A detailed
police reconstruction has found the entire attack lasted 82 seconds.
Police say he acted alone but they are trying to pinpoint his motive and
identify any possible accomplices, making the WhatsApp message a
potential clue to his state of mind and his social media contacts.
Rudd said attacks like Masood's would be easier to prevent if
authorities could penetrate encrypted services after obtaining a warrant
similar to the ones used to listen in on telephone calls or - in snail
mail days - steam open letters and read their contents.
Without a change in the system, she said terrorists would be able to
communicate with each other without fear of being overheard even in
cases where a legal warrant has been obtained.
Rudd also urged technology companies to do a better job at preventing
the publication of material that promotes extremism. She plans to meet
with firms Thursday in a bid to set up an industry board that would take
steps to make the web less useful to extremists.
British police investigating the attack say they still believe Masood, a
52-year-old Briton, acted alone and say they have no indications that
further attacks are planned.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said it may never be possible to
fully determine Masood's motives.
"That understanding may have died with him," Basu said Saturday night as
police appealed for people who knew Masood or saw him to contact
investigators. "Even if he acted alone in the preparation, we need to
establish with absolute clarity why he did these unspeakable acts, to
bring reassurance to Londoners."
ISIS, which is losing territory in Iraq and Syria but still has radical
followers in other parts of the world, has claimed Masood was a
"soldier" carrying out its wishes to attack Western countries.
Masood had convictions for violent crimes in the U.K. and spent time in
prison. He also worked in Saudi Arabia teaching English for two years
and traveled there again in 2015 on a visa designed for religious
One 58-year-old man remains in custody in the case after being arrested
in Birmingham, where Masood had been living. He has not been charged or
named. Nine others arrested after the assault have been freed without
charges and one has been freed on bail.
The family of slain police officer Keith Palmer, meanwhile, released a
statement thanking those who tried to save his life.
"There was nothing more you could have done. You did your best and we
are just grateful he was not alone," the statement said.

I did. and there's no 'if' about it. That's how Cloudflare 'protects'
sites from dDos attacks afaik, by keeping a dynamic real-time copy of
the site and there's some sort of 'sensoring' that detects that the site
protected is under attack and Cloudflare's servers, hosting a dupe of
the site under attack, take over page delivery and interactions.
That's my understanding of how it works. I you know better I'd love to

Fed's Honeypot needs. Which is why those ISIS chatrooms don't vanish.
Because if the feds said to cloudflare 'vanish them' and cloudflare
didn't, cloudflare would 'vanish'

aren't in jeopardy the second the feds tap them for a 'tap' or logged

First trillionaire: In 25 yrs Bill Gatesâ wealth to be half of Indian GDP
Updated: Jan 25, 2017 10:33 IST
Microsoft founder Bill Gates, of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
gestures during a session of the World Economic Forum(AFP)
Bill Gates, the co-founder of technology behemoth Microsoft, is on track
to become the worldâs first trillionaire, according to a report by
Oxfam, the England-headquartered confederation of charitable
organizations focused on the alleviation of global poverty.
To put things in perspective, the total gross domestic product of
Indonesia is less than a trillion dollar. That means Gates as a
trillionaire would have more wealth than what Indonesia produces in
goods and services in one year.
India, too, has a skewed proportion of wealthy people. The report quoted
that Swiss global financial services company, UBS estimates that in the
next 20 years, 500 people will hand over $2.1 trillion to their heirs, a
tad less than the GDP of India, a country where 1.3 billion people live.
Gatesâ fortunes has risen by 50%, or $25 billion since he left Microsoft
in 2006, âdespite his efforts to donate much of its in charity,â the
report said.
Gates runs the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which works to improve
education, world health and population, and around community giving.
In the 10 years after Gates took up social work, his net worth has grown
to $75 billion. The Forbes magazine calculates his net worth at $84 billion.
âIf billionaires continue to secure these returns, we could see the
worldâs first trillionaire in 25 years. In such an environment, if you
are already rich you have to try hard not to keep getting a lot richer,â
the report elaborated.
The flipside: the huge fortunes in the hand of few is a âclear evidence
of inequality crisisâ, and is hindering the âfight to end extreme povertyâ.
India, too, has a skewed proportion of wealthy people. The report quoted
that Swiss global financial services company, UBS estimates that in the
next 20 years, 500 people will hand over $2.1 trillion to their heirs, a
tad less than the GDP of India, a country where 1.3 billion people live...

Russians would give the SAF the proper mounts to do so, even if
available. I'm also VERY SKEPTICAL that the CW agent was Sarin. There's
loads of pics of USAID's "White Helmets" handing the victims without
even gloves on yet no reports of sick or dead 'helmets', and initial
reports coming out of Idlib passed on by regional twitter accounts at
the time claimed it was probably Chlorine.
Nevertheless, this was NOT a "Chemical Attack", it was a "Chemical
Release" from a building under control of the so-called 'rebels' who
were apparently manufacturing CWDs in the vicinity of civilian
populations and the US is using it as a post-facto excuse, by distorting

given selector (such as an email address or phone number) in the stream
of internet data flowing through particular network gateways (known as
the =E2=80=9Cinternet backbone=E2=80=9D). If the stream of internet packe=
ts contains the
selector, the Upstream program will acquire the entire =E2=80=9Cinternet
transaction=E2=80=9D containing that selector. Some transactions only inc=
one communication (Single Communications Transactions =E2=80=93 SCT=E2=80=
=99s), while
others contain multiple discreet communications (Multiple Communications
Transactions =E2=80=93 MCT=E2=80=99s). Because of the way the NSA conduct=
s Upstream
collection, if any communication within an SCT or MCT is =E2=80=9Cto,=E2=80=
=9D =E2=80=9Cfrom,=E2=80=9D
or even =E2=80=9Cabout=E2=80=9D a tasked selector, the entire transaction=
 is collected.
The collection of MCT=E2=80=99s further removes the nexus between the
communicants and the intended target because any communication that is
embedded within a transaction that happens to include a communication
that so much as mentions the targeted selector can get swept up.
Despite the fact that this type of surveillance has been taking place
since 2001, and that it was supposed to be regulated and overseen by the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) since 2008, it was only
in 2011 that the NSA acknowledged =E2=80=9Cabout=E2=80=9D collection and =
the MCT problem
to the FISC. (The public learned about it after revelations based on
documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden.) The FISC judge, John
Bates, allowed the collection to go forward despite his initial finding
that the collection violated the Fourth Amendment. Judge Bates accepted
NSA proposed post-collection usage rules, called minimization
procedures. The NSA adopted rules for Upstream surveillance that require
it to treat MCTs as a special category. The NSA was supposed to put
special procedures in place designed to identify when a communication
within an MCT is between American citizens.
MCTs were to be screened for irrelevant information, which must be
deleted. No agency but the NSA is supposed to have access to MCTs, not
the CIA or the FBI.
Judge Bates likely accepted this band aid despite the constitutional
problems because the NSA claimed it was not capable of breaking MCTs
down into individual messages, not capable of stopping =E2=80=9Cabout=E2=80=
collection, and insisted that this surveillance capability was
protecting the nation from terrorists.
ODNI reports that NSA will no longer collect certain internet
communications that merely mention a foreign intelligence target. The
NSA will delete the vast majority of its upstream internet data to
further protect the privacy of U.S. person communications. Further, the
changes in policy followed an in-house review of Section 702 activities
in which NSA discovered =E2=80=9Cseveral inadvertent compliance lapses.=E2=
=80=9D The
public is now waiting for a declassified FISC opinion explaining these
issues in more detail.
In other words, today we learned that those 2011 safeguards did not
work, the NSA can stop about collection, and that our counterterrorism
efforts can live without this massive invasion of privacy.
In other words=E2=80=A6Wow.
Here are some questions that the courts and Congress will need to
answer, especially since section 702 is due to expire at the end of this
year, and Americans must decide whether to renew the program, and if so,
with what safeguards in place.
The ODNI press release is unclear about whether or not NSA is ceasing
all =E2=80=9Cabout=E2=80=9D collection, or just that where one of the com=
municants is an
American. The press release says =E2=80=9Cthe Agency will stop the practi=
ce to
reduce the chance that it would acquire communications of U.S. persons
or others who are not in direct contact with a foreign intelligence
target.=E2=80=9D So, you could read that as both one end foreign and
international communication. Or, it could mean stopping collection of
only one end foreign, and the word =E2=80=9Cothers=E2=80=9D refers to tho=
se non-citizens
communicating with USPs but not with other foreigners. The statement
says =E2=80=9Csurveillance will now be limited to only those communicatio=
ns that
are directly =E2=80=9Cto=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cfrom=E2=80=9D a foreign int=
elligence target.=E2=80=9D That sounds
more comprehensive. However, if ODNI is using =E2=80=9Csurveillance=E2=80=
=9D to mean
electronic surveillance as defined in the FISA then they may still be
doing =E2=80=9Cabout=E2=80=9D collection on foreign to foreign communicat=
ions. Word
games can make it very hard to understand exactly what official
statements mean.
It appears that the NSA now has and maybe has always had a way to filter
out Americans=E2=80=99 international communications from Upstream, despit=
multiple statements to the contrary.
If they can filter statements out, that suggests ODNI can count how many
communications in the take are to or from Americans.
You should read =E2=80=9Cseveral inadvertent compliance lapses=E2=80=9D a=
s =E2=80=9Csystematic
violations of the Fourth Amendment=E2=80=9D. Remember that these minimiza=
procedures were required by Judge Bates to ameliorate constitutional
violations. Failure to follow those rules is a failure to comply with
the Fourth Amendment.
Given the problems that came to light in 2011 and then again now, has
section 702 ever been used lawfully?
ODNI admits today that they are using section 702 for =E2=80=9Ccybersecur=
That is a topic that the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board did
not study. We do not know anything about how selectors are chosen for
cybersecurity, or what the resulting database of information looks like.
While figuring out this problem, the FISC did not let section 702
collection lapse, but extended existing certifications beyond the year
expiration period. Under what authority could a FISC judge do this?
NSA is deleting the about collection data they have. That means that
they cannot find a way to use it in accordance with the 2011 Bates opinio=
I think this statement marks a change for the better in the way that the
ODNI talks about counterterrorism:
    NSA previously reported that, because of the limits of its current
technology, it is unable to completely eliminate =E2=80=9Cabout=E2=80=9D =
from its upstream 702 collection without also excluding some of the
relevant communications directly =E2=80=9Cto or from=E2=80=9D its foreign=
 intelligence
targets. That limitation remains even today. Nonetheless, NSA has
determined that in light of the factors noted, this change is a
responsible and careful approach at this time.
Today, the NSA agrees that blindly Collecting It All is not necessarily
the right thing to do. Responsible surveillance takes into account civil
liberties as well. That is big news indeed.

sure they were heavily discounted when the farmer bought the Combine....
Mine was originally a 3 speed with overdrive (horse trailer towing
vehicle) but it chucked a gear (1965-1985... 30 years) and I stuffed a 4
speed from a similar year Dodge pickup in it... which gave it a 'stump
puller' 1st gear because of the differential gear ratio mismatch. So low
I didn't need the clutch. I could rev the engine and just push the
shifter up by the 1st gear gate, and it would drop in. The truck would
lift on it's suspension about a foot, and it would start rolling. After
that it was 'gravy' to shift without the clutch. Try doing that with any
mdern transmission that uses shitty little needle bearing capped into an
aluminum housing and you'll be replacing the transmission before long.
The only problem was once you bought one... Unless something
particularly tragic happened, you never had to buy one again. That's
what killed it, and the pickup truck sales too. But in 1983 when I
needed a new rear axle for one that "Mushroomed" on brake drum removal,
the factory  still had one ... undoubtedly overmanufactured for warranty
purposes and then written off, but they had one. There's no such thing
as 'overmanufacturing for warranty purposes anymore, and if it's done
the parts are ditched as soon as written off.
That's one reason why maintaining a 'New Millennium" car like it's a
'classic', will fail. To expect an aftermarket that will still have an
"axleshaft" for a 30 year old vehicle is laughable.

You can't "Wrench" them when they're 30 years old. They've fallen apart.
By design.
I mean... I MEAN... If you really love that hole in the pavement you
pour money into, you can pour EVEN MORE MONEY into it trying to replace
parts that never fail in the designed life of the 'hole'. For instance,
my Travelall, which had ONE smog device, an OG PCV valve that wasn't
even listed as an available part because you took it apart and cleaned
it, and was, like the rest of the vehicle, intended to literally last
forever (which eventually put IH out of the small truck biz), at 30
years it had wheel rim failures (split circumferentially on the inside
of the rim mimicking a blowout), the power steering idler arm snapped
(fortunately I was parking at the time and not going 60mph), and the
door latches? Door bolts ... due to sagging hinges making the latches
unreliable at first, then non-functional. And any door/hinge assembly
you're liable to find at a junkyard or recycler is just as worn.
You CAN have the hinges rebuilt of course (Until their attachment point
on the 'hole' fails). And the brake calipers bored out by specialty
machine shops with matching Stainless Steel pucks installed like is
common with old Corvettes and Jaguars.
Just sayin'.... Spend all your money so you can scoot around in a little
metal box that isolates you from the society around you, and by
extension, those bombs falling (enter name of 3rd world nation here),

In the US, after 10 years you can no longer get many parts for you car
from the dealer. They intentionally obsolete them, ostensibly to get
allegedly 'cleaner ones' on the road, but really, force-obsoleting cars
after 10 years instead of having ones that could run indefinitely (My IH
Travelall had 40 years on it when I passed it on) is the ONLY THING that
keeps the auto industry from 'vanishing from the pages of time'.

The USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT) aims to present a
broad picture of offense and its contributions, bringing together
researchers and practitioners in all areas of computer security.
Offensive security has changed from a hobby to an industry. No longer an
exercise for isolated enthusiasts, offensive security is today a
large-scale operation managed by organized, capitalized actors.
Meanwhile, the landscape has shifted: software used by millions is built
by startups less than a year old, delivered on mobile phones and
surveilled by national signals intelligence agencies.
In the field's infancy, offensive security research was conducted
separately by industry, independent hackers, or in academia.
Collaboration between these groups could be difficult. Since 2007, the
USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT) has aimed to bring
those communities together.
WOOT '17 will feature a Best Paper Award and a Best Student Paper Award.
Computer security exposes the differences between the actual mechanisms
of everyday trusted technologies and their models used by developers,
architects, academic researchers, owners, operators, and end users.
While being inherently focused on practice, security also poses
questions such as "what kind of computations trusted systems are and
aren't capable of?," which harken back to fundamentals of computability.
State-of-the-art offense explores these questions pragmatically,
gathering material for generalizations that lead to better models and
more trustworthy systems.
WOOT provides a forum for high-quality, peer-reviewed work discussing
tools and techniques for attack. Submissions should reflect the state of
the art in offensive computer security technology, exposing poorly
understood mechanisms, presenting novel attacks, or surveying the state
of offensive operations at scale.
WOOT '17 accepts papers in both an academic security context and more
applied work that informs the field about the state of security practice
in offensive techniques. The goal for these submissions is to produce
published works that will guide future work in the field. Submissions
will be peer reviewed and shepherded as appropriate.
Submission topics include but are not limited to:

In a recently published piece for the Hoover Institution's Aegis Paper
Series, I argue that the âgoing darkâ debate ought to be considered in
the context of the larger debate over government access to data.
Encryption is not the only game in town: just as law enforcement can
pursue a number of different alternatives to mandating encryption
backdoors, so too can privacy advocates take steps beyond encrypting
their data to ensure their privacy. Acknowledging these substitutesâboth
for law enforcement and for privacy seekersâgenerates a number of
insights. For example, comprehensive reform may make more sense than
serial reforms, since it would allow for issue linkage and deal-making.

Me: That is not even a tiny bit remotely close to proof.

proof before I believe anything the US power establishment says about

hacking, not for collusion with the Russian government to hack the
Democratic party, not for treason, not for any of it. Not one single
part of your narrative is backed by hard, verifiable evidence.

entirely of unsubstantiated claims spoken in authoritative tones by the

Russiagater: Robert Mueller!

Russiagater: Its an ongoing investigation though! These things take
time. You dont know they wont find anything!
Me: See? See how that happened? You entered this conversation making
bold, confident-sounding claims that the White House has been taken over
by the Kremlin, and after a brief back-and-forth youre mumbling
something about an ongoing investigation that might maybe lead to
something someday. Why did you do that? You guys do that every single
time. You start out loud, confident and assertive, and after a few
exchanges youre telling me the investigation is ongoing and I dont
know what they will or will not find. Why not just begin the
conversation with the posture youre ending it in? Why not wait until
they do find something? Wouldnt that be infinitely more honest than
beginning the conversation with claims you know you cant substantiate?
Why are you helping to advance a completely unproven narrative?
Russiagater: So are you an idiot, or a Kremlin bot?

@_subject: DefCon attendees will have the opportunity to Hackathon 30 US Digital Voting Machines 
LAS VEGAS â Think of it as a stress test for democracy. Hackers plan to
spend this weekend trying to break into more than 30 voting machines
used in recent elections to see just how far they can get.
U.S. election officials have consistently said that despite Russian
attempts to affect the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, no
votes were tampered with.
Prove it, say organizers of DefCon, an annual hacker convention held in
Las Vegas each July.
The idea is to âstart hacking on (the machines) to raise awareness and
find out for ourselves what the deal is. I'm tired of reading
misinformation about voting system security,â Jeff Moss, DefCon founder,
wrote on the conference blog.
One of the event organizers is Matt Blaze, a professor at the University
of Pennsylvania who's been working on making election software more
secure since the mid-2000s. The the best of his knowledge, this will be
the first time a technical crowd will have the ability to look at the
machines âon a large scale.â
Thatâs in part because until 2015, it was illegal under the terms of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act to try to hack into voting machines.
âThe Library of Congress granted an exemption that explicitly allowed
this type of research, to enable good faith research of security flaws,â
said Stephanie Singer a project lead with Free & Fair, a Portland,
Ore.-based election technology company.
The event comes as  attempted election meddling has become a major
geo-political issue both in the United States and worldwide.
This week the Senate grilled the presidentâs son-in-law and adviser,
Jared Kushner, on possible collusion in Russian attempts to influence
the U.S. presidential election via hacking. (He denied collusion.)
Prior to the 2016 presidential election, hackers probed election works
in at least 39 states, according to a report by Bloomberg last month.
Cyberattacks over the past year in Ukraine, Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany,
France and Austria have attributes that linked them to suspected Russian
hackers, according to former National Intelligence director James
Clapper. They appeared to be aimed at influencing election results,
sowing discord and undermining faith in public institutions that
included government agencies, the media and elected officials.
In all of this, there has been no indication that actual votes were
changed, the FBI has said.  Election officials have cited the
decentralized nature of the U.S. election system, which is state, county
and sometimes even municipality-based.
However, experts in election voting software say no states routinely
perform post-election vote audits to ensure that the reported vote count
tallies with ballots, Singer said.
Moreover, there were no forensic examinations of any of the voting
machines used in the 2016 presidential election, in part because many
election-machine vendor contracts prohibit it, Singer said.
Thatâs a red flag for hackers at DefCon.
To see just how safe the voting machines that underpin democracy are,
they're bringing more than 30 voting machines purchased on eBay and at
government surplus sales to Las Vegas where they're setting up a âVoting
Machine Hacking Villageâ at the conference at Caesar's Palace.
There they'll spend the weekend probing the network connecting the
machines, physically attempting to alter the machines and hacking into
their hardware.
The effort is being overseen by two well-known researchers in the field
of election security, Blaze and Harri Hursti, a Finnish computer
programer who in 2005 showed it was possible to hack into a Diebold
voting machine and change vote tallies, a technique now known as âthe
Hursti Hack.â
"You never know what that kind of a spark will ignite. My hope is that
weâll see a broadening of the community of people interesting in
improving the security of our election system,â Blaze said.
The program is just one of a week's worth of computer security
conference events happening in Las Vegas. The first is Black Hat,
followed by DefCon.
Other workshop topics include how to hack a wind farm, defenses against
drones (the French military is training eagles to pluck them out of the
sky), the latest in car hacking and an in-depth look at just how hard it
is to knock out the power grid (hint: not as hard as it should be.)

@_subject: HBO hacked 
HBO has joined the ranks of Hollywood entertainment companies to suffer
a major cyber attack.
EW has learned that upcoming episodes of a couple series and at least
one alleged script or treatment have been put online by hackers who
breached the companyâs systems â with more threatened to be coming soon.
âHBO recently experienced a cyber incident, which resulted in the
compromise of proprietary information,â the network confirmed in a
statement. âWe immediately began investigating the incident and are
working with law enforcement and outside cybersecurity firms. Data
protection is a top priority at HBO, and we take seriously our
responsibility to protect the data we hold.â
Hackers claimed to have obtained 1.5 terabytes of data from the company.
So far, an upcoming episode of Ballers and Room 104 have apparently been
put online. There is also written material thatâs allegedly from next
weekâs fourth episode of Game of Thrones. More is promised to be âcoming
HBO is not commenting on what content might have been stolen, confirming
specific titles or the amount of data accessed. This morning, HBO
chairman and CEO Richard Plepler sent an email to HBO employees alerting
them of the breach.
âAs most of you have probably heard by now, there has been a cyber
incident directed at the company which has resulted in some stolen
proprietary information, including some of our programming,â he wrote.
âAny intrusion of this nature is obviously disruptive, unsettling, and
disturbing for all of us. I can assure you that senior leadership and
our extraordinary technology team, along with outside experts, are
working round the clock to protect our collective interests. The efforts
across multiple departments have been nothing short of herculean. It is
a textbook example of quintessential HBO teamwork. The problem before us
is unfortunately all too familiar in the world we now find ourselves a
part of. As has been the case with any challenge we have ever faced, I
have absolutely no doubt that we will navigate our way through this
On Sunday, an anonymous email was sent to many reporters announcing the
hack: âHi to all mankind. The greatest leak of cyber space era is
happening. Whatâs its name? Oh I forget to tell. Its HBO and Game of
Thronesâ¦â¦!!!!!! You are lucky to be the first pioneers to witness and
download the leak. Enjoy it & spread the words. Whoever spreads well, we
will have an interview with him. HBO is falling.â
Itâs not clear if the hackers actually have what would be the crown
jewel target for an HBO cyber breach â upcoming episodes of the
companyâs biggest hit, Game of Thrones. So far, no GoT episodes have leaked.
In April, a hacker penetrated Netflix to release episodes from season 5
of Orange Is the New Black ahead of its summer return. And in May, a
hacker claimed to have stolen Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No
Tales, but Disney chief Bob Iger later said the threat was a hoax. The
biggest Hollywood hack victim was Sony in 2014, where approximately 100
terabytes of data was uploaded online (versus the 1.5 TB claimed in the
HBO attack).
For years, HBO has fought a cyber-battle to keep Game of Thrones
storylines secret and the showâs content from being illegally
distributed â particularly before episodes air. In season 5, the first
four episodes leaked online before the showâs season premiere after
review DVDs that were sent to the press and industry insiders. HBO has
since halted the practice of sending any episodes in advance. That same
year, some clips leaked ahead of time from overseas HBO distributors,
and even images of Jon Snowâs death found their way online before the
finale aired. Just a couple weeks ago, a Thrones trailer to be screened
at Comic-Con leaked onto YouTube in advance of its release.

to describe in public what America would look like if they were in

people should want.
Ask lots of questions and really press him to explain his vision; make
him describe his entire utopia. Who would have to leave? Where would
they go? Who would get to stay? How would you make that happen? Would
there be DNA tests? Has he taken a DNA test? What precisely is so great
about a white ethnostate? What would happen to food, live music and
entertainment? Once you drag their whole vision out into the light,
there are very few people who would ever find such a vision appealing
enough to try and manifest. It does not sell itself. Thereâs not much to
say there beyond âUhhâ¦ no thanks.â

Radiohead hides ZX Spectrum proggie in OK Computer re-release
Unclear if code was first mistaken for avant garde instrumental
By Simon Sharwood, APAC Editor
17 Jul 2017 at 07:27
Rock deities Radiohead have snuck a program for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum
into a re-release of their seminal 1997 album âOK Computerâ.
Dubbed âOKNOTOKâ, the re-release can be had as Â£100/US$130/â¬120 boxed
edition that includes three vinyl records, books galore and âa C90
cassette mix tape compiled by us, taken from OK COMPUTER session
archives and demo tapes.â
The Spectrum app resides â natch â on the C90 cassette, as that medium
was the dominant way of storing Speccy programs and data. Accounts of
the cassette's track list suggest it opens with a track named âZx
sprectrum symphonyâ but that the application is listed as âOk Computer
Programâ and is the last track on side B.
Buyers quickly identified the track as sounding just like a Spectrum
program's distinctive series of beeps and clicks. Before long clever
folk had ripped the audio and fed it to Spectrum Emulators, producing
the results below.
See site for image:
Radiohead are far from the first band to pull off this trick: The
Stranglers added a game called âAural Questâ to their 1984 Album Aural
Sculpture. Buzzcock-turned-Homosapien Pete Shelley's second album XL1
included a program that displayed its lyrics on-screen in synch with the
music (With limited success, if your correspondent's 35-year-old
recollections are accurate).
Those efforts appeared at a time the Spectrum was prevalent and popular.
Radiohead's release has proven an education to many, but no surprise to
fans who know well that track five on OK Computer, âLet Downâ, featured
sounds produced using a Spectrum. Radiohead guitarist/keyboardist Jonny
Greenwood made those sounds as he is known to have learned to program
the machine.

Dude! There's so many more features that make a person a Nazi rather

For instance. Nazis, by definition, have a really perverse christian
(snigger) Identity, that excludes all other organized or non-organized
religions. and allows for the extermination (Vernichtung) of humans.
What WOULD the Zombie Jesus do?
Nazis are by definition fascists, and there's ... oh lets say 14,
defining traits
. Racism is only
corollary to those 14 in that Nazis believes White Christians are the
"Master Race", and black folks, like Jews and everyone else, are
untermenschen... Subhuman.
That's exactly why they aren't a viable form of human life. They
essentially self-exterminate by ticking EVERYONE off. Slaughtering them

Yeah yeah. That's what they say, usually correctly (albeit the Ukraine

historical events, but Fascism IS ETERNAL, The definition is right here:
All 14 traits.
14. You don't like it? start delineating more and get back to me:
The Nazi ideology is a christian identity ideology that believes, in a
very un-christian way, that anyone not of their ETHNIC BACKGROUND is
literally sub-human. Zionist share that trait when they say moronic shit
like "A Palestinian life isn't worth a Jewish fingernail".
Ukraine IS a fascist nation whose leaders have roots in their family's
historical siding with the NAZIS during WWII. You might note they're
slightly stoopid because the Nazis threw their guiding light Bandera in
prison. It would have saved his modern day believers a lot of trouble if
the Nazis had offed him, making the Nazi Fascist belief system a little
less palatable. They would simply be virulent, murderous, nationalists.
Actually, they're NEVER going to own it. Their forebearers allegedly
did, and it seems they REALLY fucked up. So this time the big mythical
banana said they could LIVE IN IT, if certain condition were met.
I do not believe they've ever met, or intend to ever meet those conditions.
But you see, they may have "Jewish blood" by birth, or conversion, but
The Zionists in Israel aren't "Jews". They're christian ethic-d and
moral-d Europeans and North American invaders (europeans) re-settled. It
has to do with Worldview. Like all indigenous people everywhere,
bloodlines are not the only thing that qualifies one.

The House Judiciary Committee has a unique role to play in times of
great national crisis in the functioning of the presidency. As the
congressional body with jurisdiction over the initial stages of the
impeachment process, itâs the committeeâs responsibility to weigh
whether the presidentâs misconduct is sufficiently severe so as to merit
what Charles Black refers to as âthis most drastic of measures.â
Fortunately, Chairman Bob Goodlatte and the Republican members of his
committee are up to the task. Last week, with Russia matters heating up
and the White House in full meltdown, they stayed focused on the real
danger at hand: Huma Abedin.
The committee voted to adopt an amended resolution introduced by
Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL) calling for a special counsel
investigation into, variously, former Attorney General Loretta Lynchâs
instructions to former FBI Director James Comey to refer to the Clinton
email probe as a âmatterâ rather than an âinvestigationâ; Comeyâs leaks
to Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman; Comeyâs leaks to
New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt as far back as 1993 (when
Schmidt, who graduated college in 2005, would have been around ten years
old); âcollusionâ between Comey and Robert Mueller; any knowledge by
Comey of the Steele dossier and of efforts by the intelligence community
to surveill Trump or unmask his associates in a quest to damage Trumpâs
campaign or his presidency; immunity deals provided by the FBI to
various Clinton aides over the course of the email investigation;
whether Clinton secretly approved a deal to transfer U.S. uranium
deposits to Russian control in return for donations to the Clinton
Foundation; and yes, the specific circumstances of Huma Abedinâs
employment at the State Department.
If this sounds like the work of conspiracy theorists, thatâs because
thatâs exactly what it is. Wired reported on Friday that a Gaetz staffer
appears to have crowdsourced the amended resolution with the help of
r/The_Donald, a pro-Trump subreddit notorious for both its embrace of
conspiracy theories and its gleeful offensiveness. The Reddit user,
âDevinm666,â regularly posted on the forum praising Gaetz, referencing
his work in Congress, and at one point publishing a picture of his
congressional ID badge with his name and face blacked out. According to
Wired, Gaetz confirmed that âDevinm666â is Devin Murphy, a legislative
aide in his office.
âI work for Congress and have been asked to come up with a list of
Clinton/Obama/election scandals for my boss ASAP,â Murphy apparently
posted on Reddit, asking for suggestions. âThis is not a shitpost. This
is real. Congressional investigation. Do it for America!â
So r/The_Donald rose to the occasion and did it for America.
The text in question is not a bill, but rather a resolution of inquiry.
If passed by the House, it wouldnât require the Attorney General to
begin a special counsel investigation running in parallel with Robert
Muellerâs investigation (and possibly branching into it in order to
investigate Mueller himself), but would merely âexpress the sense of the
House of Representatives that a special counsel should be appointed.â
That may be for the best, as there is already an investigation into a
number of the issues listed in the resolution by the Department of
Justice Inspector General. Additionally, most of the offenses fail to
measure up to the standards for a special counsel appointment set out in
either the Department of Justice regulations or the now-defunct
independent counsel statute, which both anticipate possible violations
of criminal law.
This procedural note on Gaetzâs call for a special counselâits technical
status as a resolution of inquiry, rather than a billâis key to
understanding how it came to exist in the first place. On July 14th,
Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and David Cicilline (D-RI) of the
House Judiciary Committee introduced a resolution requesting that the
Department of Justice provide Congress with various documents relevant
to the firing of James Comey. After the committee took up the
resolution, Rep. Gaetz introduced an amendment to scoop out the content
and replace it with Gaetzâs request for a special counsel, while keeping
Jayapal and Cicillineâs names on top. Gaetzâs proposal was adopted with
the full support of the committeeâs majority.
Though Gaetzâs amendment and the majorityâs vote were within the letter
of House procedures, Democrats on the committee areâto put it
mildlyâsomewhat put out by what they view as a âhijackingâ of the normal
But who can blame the majority? With the Mueller investigation
continuing apace and the presidency spiraling ever further into chaos,
you wouldnât want a responsible body of congressional oversight to get
distracted from whatâs really important. Good thing the majority can
boot up Reddit.

Yes. Absolutely. They were also the people tasked with things like
"packing gold into the Burmese Golden Triangle and trading it to drug
lords, then packing out opium in a US drug suppression program"
That's a near-verbatim quote from a Scholastic Book Services Weekly
Reader given me at a NY public skool in 1965 or so, complete with a pic
of pack wearing grunts in a single file column on a trail (may have been
a stock shot) and it was my very first WTF moment regarding the Vietnam
war. That US GREEN BERETS were transporting OPIUM, for WHATEVER reason!
I did not know until later that opium was going to become the French
Connection herowhine from Marseilles.
It was also news around NYU in the 60s, where the CIA was recruiting
foreign language readers as analysts to peruse piles of, lets say
Russian newspapers, to clip all things pertinent to, oh lets say
Ukraine's grain harvests, to send up the chain for further analysis,
that those hires and their managers were quitting in droves saying they
couldn't discern between the CIA's ops and the Mafia herowhine peeps.
As an aside, after I read Mike Ruppert's "Crossing The Rubicon", where
he recounted in the forward how his Ex had been observing Navy hardhat
divers near the oil platforms off the Gulf Coast Lousyanna, and later
mafia controlled work boats would come around and pick up packages
attached to the legs of the rigs, Heroin, I mentioned that to my ADL
intelligence officer dad and he piped right up and spilled the name of
the Lousyanna docks mafia boss at the time and basically validated
everything Ruppert mentioned.

Oldest white supremacist site shut down after complaint
By JAY REEVES Associated Press
August 28, 2017 12:03 PM
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - The founder of the internet's oldest white
supremacist site said he was trying to get back online Monday after a
company revoked its domain name following complaints that it promotes
hatred and is linked to dozens of murders.
Don Black, a former Ku Klux Klan leader who has operated stormfront.org
since 1995, said he didn't receive any warning before Network Solutions
blocked the use of the stormfront.org name on Friday.
Stormfront.org had more than 300,000 registered users, Black said, with
traffic increasing since a violent white nationalist rally in
Charlottesville, Virginia.
Popular with the KKK and neo-Nazi groups, the site included forums where
users sometimes promoted white power events.
"I'm talking to my lawyers, and that's about all I can do right now,"
Black, of West Palm Beach, Florida, said in a telephone interview. "I
can switch to another domain, but it might wind up the same way."
Another major white supremacist website, The Daily Stormer, was
previously shut down by the web-hosting company Go Daddy and then Google
after the violence in Charlottesville.
The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law said the
stormfront.org shutdown followed complaints it filed with Network
Solutions alleging the site promotes not only hate speech, but deadly
A spokesman for Network Solutions didn't immediately return an email
seeking comment.
Users of Black's website have been implicated in more than 100 killings,
according to the complaint, including 77 people slain by neo-Nazi Anders
Breivik at a camp in Norway in 2011.
"Especially in the wake of tragic events in Charlottesville and the
spike in hate crimes across the country, Stormfront crossed the line of
permissible speech and incited and promoted violence," said a statement
by Kristen Clarke, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for
Civil Rights Under Law.
Black, speaking about the shutdown during an online radio show Monday,
said his site had rules against promoting violence or any crime.
Black was a state KKK leader under former Klan Imperial Wizard David
Duke, who appeared on the radio show following Black and expressed his
"full support" for Black and the website.
"He was the first major site defending the rights of white people," said
Black has been involved in the white supremacy movement since the 1970s
and was convicted in 1981 for his role in a right-wing plot to overthrow
the government of Caribbean island nation of Dominica.

The Alt-Right and Antifa Are Waging a New Kind of Internet Warfare
Jacob Siegel, Vice
Aug 30 2017, 8:25am
Intelligence and surveillance powers that once belonged only to
militaries and state spooks are now available to anyone with a
high-speed internet connection.
Live long enough and you may hear future historians recall the war
between 4chan and an art collective called LaBeouf, RÃ¶nkkÃ¶ & Turner.
They'll tell the story of how anonymous, interconnected imageboard users
gathered clues from public video footage, like passing aircraft and the
position of stars, to geolocate the roving, anti-Trump art project He
Will Not Divide Us, put on by actor Shia LaBeouf and his collaborators.
Records will show that the people on the group's trailâpro-Trump
activists, impish saboteurs, and budding neo-Nazisâdidn't need high-end
spy gear. Instead, they found their mark by collecting and processing
public information through decentralized and supposedly leaderless
networks. It might one day look, in retrospect, like a form of social
automation: continuously updating intelligence assessments converted
into real-world effect by volunteer foot "soldiers" acting without orders.
Or maybe the saga will be remembered as a trial run of sorts, when
tactics later used in domestic guerilla warfare first appeared as
sinister pranks. Whatever happens next, the genie is out of the bottle,
and intelligence and surveillance capabilities that once belonged only
to militaries and state spooks are now available to anyone with a
high-speed internet connection.
Military theorist and futurist John Robb, who wrote the influential 2008
book Brave New War: The Next Stage of Terrorism and the End of
Globalization, developed the concept of "open-source insurgency" to
describe emerging forms of conflict. You can see a version of it at work
in the current season of political upheaval and clashes in American cities.
Of course, it's violence in the streets that captures most of the
attention, especially after a car plowed into a crowd amid the neo-Nazi
spectacle in Charlottesville, killing counter-protester Heather Heyer
and injuring many more. But in the background, much of the fighting is
being done online. Memes, trolls, bans, doxes, sock puppets, and
targeted disruption campaigns like the one used against LaBeouf, RÃ¶nkkÃ¶
& Turner are being deployed in a cycle of attacks and counterattacks
that, much like traditional military intelligence and information
operations, set conditions for the next round of physical confrontation.
The foundation of open-source insurgency is what Robb calls
"superempowerment": "an increase in the ability of individuals and small
groups to accomplish tasks/work through the combination of rapid
improvements in technological tools and access to global networks." That
increase, Robb argues, "has enabled small groups to radically increase
their productivity in conflict."
It's a concept that helps make sense of the seemingly outsized cultural
clout of the alt-right, a movement built on beliefs that fail to attract
more than fringe support in national surveys...

CCleaner Malware Targeted Tech Giants Cisco, Google, Microsoft
Kelly Sheridan
The backdoor discovered in Avast's CCleaner targeted top tech companies
including Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Sony, VMware, and Cisco.
When Cisco Talos and Morphisec discovered a version of Avast CCleaner
had been compromised to deliver malware, it was bad enough to learn
millions of endpoints were threatened. Now, security experts say the
attackers had espionage in mind.
Earlier this week, both firms published research detailing the
compromise of CCleaner version 5.33, which was available for download
from August 15, 2017 until the release of v5.34 on September 12. The
binary included in v5.33 contained a multi-stage malware payload to
collect information including a list of running processes and all
software installed on the machine.
Further analysis on the attack, published by Talos on Sept. 20,
unearthed some concerning details.
Researchers acquired an archive of files stored on the attackers'
command and control (C2) server, which contained code listing major
organizations targeted with a second-stage loader. If a machine from one
of those networks connected, it would be hit with a secondary payload.
"What happened is the attacker was using this giant net," says Craig
Williams, senior technical lead at Cisco Talos. "In the four days the
command and control server had data for, 700,000 victims connected with
it â¦ but [the attackers] only wanted a tiny fraction of them."
Analysis of the C2 tracking database, which spanned four days in
September, revealed at least 20 victim machines hit with specialized
secondary payloads. Targeted organizations included Microsoft, Google,
HTC, Sony, Samsung, D-Link, Akamai, VMware, Linksys, and Cisco itself.
During that timeframe, the malware regularly contacted the C2 server to
send information about infected systems. This included IP addresses,
online time, hostname, domain name, process listings, and other data.
Researchers believe attackers likely used this to determine which
machines they should target during the campaign's final stages.
"This is pretty much exactly what we expected," says Williams. "It quite
literally fits the definition of an APT."
Because Cisco Talos was only able to analyze four days of activity
during the time CCleaner v5.33 was available for download, he continues,
they have no idea how often this list of corporations was altered. They
believe the target list was changed during the period the C2 server was
active in order to compromise different businesses.
"When you hear two million machines were infected, it implies a
commodity criminal," says John Bambenek, manager of threat systems at
Fidelis Cybersecurity. "Now we're talking corporate environments, and
it's hard to see that as anything other than an espionage attack."
Williams says the recommendations stay the same for affected businesses:
systems should be wiped, restored from backup, or reinstalled. This is
an example of why users need to have reliable backups amid the rise of
supply-chain attacks.
"From the advent of this discovery, we had been warning users to recover
from backups," he emphasizes. "We had been telling people, nobody knows
what happened so you have to recover from backups."
Who did it?
Both Bambenek and Williams say the attack is well-made and likely the
work of a sophisticated actor, though it's still unclear who it might be.
The contents of the Web directory taken from the C2 server included PHP
files responsible for controlling communications with infected machines.
One of these files, which contains core variables and operations used,
specifies the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the time zone.
Williams says this does not mean Chinese actors are responsible. In
fact, he believes the opposite. This is especially well-crafted malware,
made with a significant amount of development time and complex database.
If it really was China, why leave the timestamp?
"I suspect it's a false flag," he proposes, though it's hard to say for
Interestingly, Bambenek points out, CCleaner was a curious choice for
this victim pool.
"My first thought was, I'm not entirely sure how many of these
enterprises would have used CCleaner," says Fidelis' Bambenek. "This is
casting a broad net for an app you probably wouldn't find in enterprise
While he says this may not be a particularly successful attack in terms
of the hackers' true objectives, it shows threat actors are willing to
think outside the box to achieve their goals.
"Two million infected computers is nothing to shake a fist at," he
notes. "It shows they're willing to try new things and experiment. The
adversary doesn't have complete visibility into what's typically used in
enterprises. They need to make guesses."

Ben Buchanan
Thursday, September 7, 2017
"Traditionally, signals intelligence is neatly bifurcated into offense
and defense: intercept adversariesâ communication technology and protect
oneâs own. In the modern era, however, there is great convergence in the
technologies used by friendly nations and by hostile ones. Iâve tried to
tackle some of this in a new paper, âNobody But Us: The Rise and Fall of
the Golden Age of Signals Intelligence.â Itâs published as part of the
Hoover Institution's Aegis Paper Series.
My animating idea is that signals intelligence agencies find themselves
in a dilemma: they must penetrate the very same technologies that they
also at times must protect. The United States perhaps feels this tension
most acutely, for a variety of reasons. To resolve it, the United States
and its partners have relied on an approach sometimes called Nobody But
Us, or NOBUS: target communications mechanisms using unique methods
accessible only to the United States. This approach, which calls for
advanced methods, aims to protect communications from American
adversaries, yet also ensure American access when needed.
But the NOBUS approach depends as well on a number of American
advantages that are under serious threat. These advantages for a time
enabled what many have called âthe golden age of signals intelligence.â
The decline of these advantages renews the tension between offense and
defense once more. My paper examines how the NOBUS approach works, its
limits, and the challenging matter of what comes next."

I forget what Hoffman's dose was estimated as being, but he was a
tripper once a year till the day he died
10 micrograms wouldn't do a whole lot, unless you eat a lot of paper or

Sandoz standard dosage was 350mics
I knew a guy who ate a whole sheet of Blue Dot blotter in 1971. One of
the last remaining OG STP family (pre-roadie alcoholic street gang)

was/is George, a straight, slightly effeminate puerto rican kid who had
been working a a grocery delivery boy... He showed up one morning at me
and my GF's safe house sponsored by Jewish Family Services (until the
certified folks could contact the kid's parents or investigate abuse
claims as reason not to contact). George ended up with a new persona.
Sgt Pepper! He literally affected a brit accent (Ringo). Wore a brass
button blazer. Talked in Be-At-Els type rhyme. I lost track of him when
I moved to Vt in '73, but ran into him again at Earth People's Park
Shattuck Ave house when I first got to California in 1976. He was 'back
to earth'; the George I met when he first showed up at my E4th and B
Lower East Side slum apartment, but 5 years older (20 or so).

STP was a whole 'nother thing. The 'trip' was described somewhere (I
think Abbie Hoffman in Revolution for the Hell of It) as 'long and
juiceless' ...
It's METHAMPHETAMINE, which also has clinical uses. Raving till you chew
thru your pacifier and drop from dehydration isn't 'clinical'. Just sayin'.
I knew the people who distrubuted MDA on the East Coast in the 60s and
MDA had the same deleterious effects from long term usage. AFAICT LSD
had no effects that would be noted by psychologists or behavioral
therapists as 'deleterious'.
By 1969 or 1970, or 71, or so, most of what was passed off as LSD was
either ALD-52 or MDA, or some other designer drug. When LSD became
illegal in the US not only did the feds immediately clamp down on all
the organic resources such as Ergotamine Tartrate, indole, and other
items necessary for LSD production (A special # Sylvania blue bulb was
necessary at one point in it's manufacture. IMAGINE what would happen if
a lighting house received an oddball order for a few), as was noted at
the time in the underground newspapers, many of the supply houses WERE
THE FEDS, and they used the mailing lists quite effectively to shut down
You might want to listen to this... From one of Owsley's close personal
friends, on his passing.
March 15 2011 Travus T. Hipp Morning News & Commentary: Owsley, The Man
Who 'Changed The Minds' Of An Entire Generation... Literally... Passes
Owsley wasn't a chemist you know... He was a speedfreak. His GF was an
organic chemist, and as is so succinctly pointed out here, what made
Owsley the 'name you could trust' in LSD, was he actually tried the shit
before he sold it. Most of what was passed off as L was made by scumbags
not far removed from the Mafia (Brotherhood of Eternal Light at their
former missile silo in was it Nebraska?). The Mafia LUVS chemicals. Easy
to transport unlike bulky stinky weed, and the one thing I noted in my
experience in NY, when ever you got around L dealers, you started seeing
guns, and people who looked A LOT like feds.
As you described it, "empathogen,", it has certain SPECIFIC effects,
just like every other ordinary pharmaceutical, and just because you feel
all lovey dovey DOES NOT NOR HAS IT EVER MEANT, you 'explored your inner
space'. The phrase "Adjunct to Psychotherapy" come to mind. Tripping
with a bunch of people who are just like wow I love you groovy then they
go back to my day job slicing throats at some corporate hack job or
another, doesn't, and WHERE IS THE "GUIDANCE"? It's the hedonists
leading the hedonists down the rosy path to... I dunno. Running into a
fire at "burning man" or some stupid thing like that.
Torture (in 1st case), and Social engineering/subterfuge (2nd) is
cheaper and just as "reliable".
Gil Scott-Heron on Street Corner Chemistry. A short poem precedes:
I figure, even in 1968, only about half of what I ever consumed was
actually LSD, and my bottom line is I don't know why anyone would bother
with chemicals today when you can purchase 'mushrooom kits' and the seed
houses no longer give a fuck if you're buying Hawaiian Wood Rose pods or
Salvia in bulk, etc.
The West Coast "Thing", which I never could understand, was Wine by the
gallon jug and L. No one ever suffered respiratory arrest.

... says someone who never took STP. A 3 day peak and a total burn out.
BZ was intended to be an INCAPACITATING AGENT, not a psychotropic.
Everyone knew that by 1968 and very few people actually ever used it.
Ps. I have problems with MDMA as an 'analogue' to LSD. MDMA is
methamphetamine based and although it exhibits certain
psychedeic-experience-like properties, it's still Meth, and the long
term effect of it's use, if not as dramatic (usually), IS similar.

I didn't say, nor do I have any way of knowing what percentage of China's citizens are 100% happy with the government. I did imply if their government crossed them, a billion... Even 10% of a billion, is a lot of people to try to stop.
As I understand it there are bad cops and complicit silent ones.
My bad... Should have used the term primary-suspect-in-murder cop (as opposed to accomplice), but too wordy.
If you read the piece you'll note they also tore his accomplice limb from limb and stuffed hi in their squad car too, before torching it.

It doesn't appear that she ever actually paid into the retirement system as a wage earner or by voluntary contribution.
SSI is paid to impoverished people who never worked a day in their lives once they turn 65 for instance, or to people who drug/alcohol damage themselves, can't work, and never got enough quarters of work in to qualify for retirement benefits. My meager retirement check will be supplemented with SSI when I turn 65.
According to FACT she took the money at the insistence of close acquaintances to keep her from going broke due to her medical bills. That's SSDI, again, NOT money derived for an individual's payment into the system.
She was a welfare slut more than any Teenage Immigrant Welfare Mother On Drugs, who never had a chance to have best-seller books that must have made her millions. She was a hypocritical luzer, just like all Libertarians. Deluded, hypocritical, lying to themselves and others, luzers.

There's absolutely nothing there that six eyes isn't doing, including direct censorship. The only difference is the Chinese leadership is honest about it, which gives their citizens the option of fucking them back. I give the Chinese government credit for that. Meanwhile the average Westerner would categorically deny their governments does any of that and their government denies they do it.
About that "Fucking them back" thing.
Compare what happens in China when a rogue cop kills a community member to what the typical American community does, then apply that to what COULD happen to their government if it didn't have the support of it's billion citizens regarding almost anything... Including internet surveillance. Meanwhile Americans don't support that sort of surveillance of themselves... But prefer to remain ignorant of it.

@_subject: Razer gets a call from the fedz about a ZuckerBook 'post you made in April' 
============================== START ==============================
I just got a voicemail from one special agent Delligan (sp? And why are they almost always Irish?) in DC about a 'post you made in April', and he wanted a callback. On calling I got a voicemail box that sounded legit but I still suspected a FB phishing expedition. So I dialed the same number but instead of the last 2 digits I dialed 00... Fast busy. So I dial 01, and get a senator's office. Not a Phishing trip... I left a rather rude voicemail at the phone number and got a callback about 10 minutes later.
The post in question, from April was in regard to the Congressional Baseball game, which had a shooter drop in if you'll recall. My post was just before they tried have their ballgame again and RollCall was commenting on the security. In the post I basically suggested that there's no foolproof way to protect a congressman on an open air ballfield from a sniper at 300 yard with a bolt action rifle. Apparently the Capitol Police ARE worried about such a possibility and were 'assessing' all possible threat scenarios made on social media. After a five minute chat he assumed I wasn't intending to be a 'shooter' nor instructing anyone how to be one, or even suggesting anyone should be one, and here is the post:
"I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth, banks are going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it.
We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit watching our TV's while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be. We know things are bad - worse than bad. They're crazy.
It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, 'Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.'
Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get mad! I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to riot - I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
All I know is that first you've got to get mad!"

I'll take a Persian scholar's word for it over a fucking google search.
So I did a quickie.
Leads to Who resided in East Arabia... Right next door to Iran.
Eastern Arabia was historically known as Bahrain (Arabic: Ø§ÙØ¨Ø­Ø±ÙÙâ)
until the 18th century. This region stretched from the south of Basra
along the Persian Gulf coast and included the regions of Bahrain,
Kuwait, Al-Hasa, Qatif, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Southern Iraq, and
Northern Oman. The entire coastal strip of Eastern Arabia was known as
âBahrainâ for ten centuries.[1]
Until very recently, the whole of Eastern Arabia, from southern Iraq to
the mountains of Oman, was a place where people moved around, settled
and married unconcerned by national borders.[1]
I'll take that as proof of Cole's statement, stupid.

Good morning, Mister Blue
We've got our eyes on you
The evidence is clear, that you've been scheming
You like to steal away
And while away the day
You=E2=80=99d like to spend an hour dreaming
What will it take, to whip you into line?
A broken heart
A broken head
It can be arranged
It can be arranged
Step softly, Mister Blue
We know what's best for you
We know where your precious dreams will take you
You've got a slot to fill
And fill that slot you will
You'll learn to love it, or we'll break you
What will it take, to whip you into line?
A broken heart
A broken head
It can be arranged
It can be arranged
Be careful, Mister Blue
This phase you're going through
Can lead you nowhere else but to disaster
Excuse us while we grin
You've worn our patience thin
It's time to show you who's your master
Don't worry, Mister Blue
We'll take good care of you
Just think of it as sense and not surrender
But never think again
That you can think again
Or you'll get something you'll remember
What will it take, to whip you into line?
A broken heart
A broken head
It can be arranged
It can be arranged=20

SOMEHOW I really don't feel sorry for anyone involved in scamming money
propagating state propaganda and historical disinformation, which IS
what TV and all Hollyweird movies are.
"Two programmers pleaded guilty to copyright charges in association with
two illegal streaming services, including one site that had more content
than Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime, according to the Department of Justice.
Darryl Julius Polo, 36, pleaded guilty last week to running Las
Vegasâbased streaming site iStreamItAll as well as working on the
illegal streaming website Jetflicks, the Justice Department announced
He also pleaded guilty to money laundering, according to federal
Luis Angel Villarino, 40, pleaded guilty in a separate trial on Friday
to working as a computer programmer on Jetflicks.
Polo said he reproduced tens of thousands of copyrighted television
episodes and movies without authorization and streamed and distributed
the programs to thousands of paid subscribers throughout the U.S.,
prosecutors said.
Polo would send out emails to iStreamItAll subscribers urging them to
cancel subscriptions to licensed sites, highlighting the catalog of
118,479 TV episodes and 10,980 movies, according to the Justice Department.
The illegal website had more content than licensed streaming services
Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Amazon Prime, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors said Polo would use âsophisticated computer programmingâ to
search global pirate sites for new illegal content.
Polo and Villarino both pleaded guilty to also working separately as
computer programmers at Jetflicks, another subscription-based illegal
streaming site based out of Las Vegas.
Poloâs sentencing will be held on March 13, and Villarinoâs will be held
on March 20."

ð Love you Chelsea! See you at the Barricades ð´ââ ï¸
"WhenÂ  Judge Anthony Trenga ordered Chelsea Manning back to jail for
refusingÂ  to testify before the grand jury investigating WikiLeaks, he
urged herÂ  to âreflect on the principles she says sheâs embracingâ as
well asÂ  âwhether those views are worth the price sheâs paying for
them.â TrengaÂ  maintained there was âno dishonorâ in cooperating with a
grand juryÂ  because the United States Constitution codified the grand jury.
ManningÂ  took Trengaâs admonishment seriously and responded with a
letterÂ  containing research she did with the help of her attorneys. It
presentedÂ  her position on the grand jury in a very clear and compelling
InÂ  doing so, Manning further demonstrated her resistance is about muchÂ 
more than defying an investigation into a dissident media organization.Â 
It is about publicly discrediting the institution and all its
corruptionÂ  once and for all.
Manning,Â  who is in jail at the William G. Truesdale Adult Detention
Center inÂ  Alexandria, Virginia, was held in civil contempt of court on
May 16. TheÂ  federal court not only sent her back to jail but also
imposed a fine ofÂ  $500 per day after 30 days and a fine of $1000 per
day after 60 days ifÂ  she continues her resistance.
IfÂ  Manning âpersists in her refusalâ for the next 16 months, according
toÂ  her legal team, she will face a total amount of fines that is overÂ 
$440,000. Both jail and fines may violate her Eighth Amendment rightsÂ 
under the Constitution, especially since these sanctions are supposed
toÂ  be coercive, not punitive.
In her letter [PDF],Â  Manning contended the modern grand jury barely
resemble the grand jury,Â  which the framers enshrined in the
Constitution. She acknowledges muchÂ  of her opposition comes from their
use against activists but also makesÂ  it clear she believes the
institution generally undermines due processÂ  for all citizens."

HAHAHHA! SCO! The Silicon Beach pirates ... Linux thieves!
Coherent.. I used it on a 386 after playing with Microware's OS9v2 for
Color Computers.
I stuck with that COCO3 until the early 90s. I refused to use XT 8088s
or MS-Dos because they simply couldn't multitask. I put jNos on one,
text-file driven tcpip with tools, for ham radio, then put a bunk IP at
the end of the nameserver list and pointed the connection that way. It
was a ham radio tcp/ip node list. MAYBE a few hundred kilobytes. A
half-hour later the XT was STILL chugging it'a way through the
nameserver list, and I pulled the plug.

I think John's posting of Tim's email pretty much resolved it. Anyone
who expects a US public (or private) server owner not to obey a US court
order's instructions is too stupid to be using a computer on the
internet. Tim wasn't stupid. He wasn't riseup and neither are the pglaf
people who operate this one as what appears to be, overall, a spam
catching machine. I wonder sometimes if the relevant people who analyze
spam email for a living use these archives for research data. It's not
much different than the tattered, abused, remnants of the former
almighty USNet newsgroups.

HAHAHAHA! The constitution give you no rights. It delineates trade relations between the states and foreign relations, tariffs, etc.
The BILL OF RIGHTS allegedly does, but it, unlike the RICH WHITE PROPERTY OWNING CHRISTIAN MEN'S constitution, is continually weakened, since the day the constitution was signed, and the RICH WHITE PROPERTY OWNING CHRISTIAN MEN'S constitution is continually strengthened.
You have no rights you aren't willing to die for Libertard. Get over it.
"Fuck the constitution
Are we part of the solution or are we part of the pollution?
Sittin' by and wonderin' why,
Things ain't the way we like to find them to be, to be
For you and for me the people over there and the ones in between
You can pass the buck or pass the baton
But you can't pass the police or the pentagon
The I.R.S. or the upper echelon
I think it's time to make a move on the contradiction
Bomb-Bomb, rock the nation
Take over television and radio station
Bomb-Bomb the truth shall come
Give the corporation some complication!"
