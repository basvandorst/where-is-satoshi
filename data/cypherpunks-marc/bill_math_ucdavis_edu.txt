Are the update RPM's available directly without using Up2date so we can work around the various conflicts (glibc and ncurses today)?

Same here:
[root root]# up2date-nox -u glibc
Fetching package list for channel: rhel3-beta1-ws-x86_64...

There was a package dependency problem. The message was:
Unresolvable chain of dependencies:
glibc-2.3.2-69                           requires glibc-common = 2.3.2-69
I've also had similar problems with ncurses.
