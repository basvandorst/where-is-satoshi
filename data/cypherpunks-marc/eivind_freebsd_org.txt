@_subject: Re: ALSA merged into Linux kernel and voice encryption 
Support enough to do this has been in FreeBSD for years, and you also get a
more free license.  You'd also generally want to patch the kernel for an app
like that (I would, at least), so integration or non-integration of ALSA isn't
much of an issue.  Not that it isn't good for the Linuxers (the ones that
haven't tried FreeBSD yet ;) that they get decent sound support, it is just
that this is not particularly enabling for the apps you mention.
