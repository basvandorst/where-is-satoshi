Once properly seeded, /dev/urandom is good enough. The main issue with it
is initial seeding and not using up entropy.
CJDNS doesn't use RSA. It uses elliptic curve crypto, specifically
where a private key is just a random number. No need for being a prime.

One could require the user to specify/confirm a certificate fingerprint on
gmail in such a case. That way you're MitM proof, even with a self signed

abysmal performance unless there are high performance entropy sources
available. After the initial seeding this gains very little security in
it's not guaranteed to be secure and sometimes fails in practice.
What you normally want is a source that blocks after boot until it has
accumulated enough initial entropy (say 256 bits), and then never blocks
It's not like a good PRNG gets weaker as more data is read from it when
your adversaries are computationally bounded.

My argument concerning performance is that for long messages SipHash
isn't actually significantly faster than (possibly round reduced) MD5,
Skein, Blake2 etc.
The main selling point of SipHash is that it's faster than normal
crypto hashes for short messages. Since ZFS almost always hashes long
the advantage of SipHash doesn't matter.

Is SipHash really that fast in this context? AFAIK it's only much
faster for short strings, since its block size is so small.
The downsides of SipHash are:
* lack of collision resistance when the key is known
* small 64 bit output, which means that collisions will happen
frequently and need to be handled
SipHash is great for use in hash tables, where it's fine if a bucket
contains two or three items, but I don't think it's a good match for ZFS.

We need to catch a CA which does this, for example using Certificate
Then handing over the CA private key is equivalent to committing company
This means that
1. CAs will fight with all they've got
2. If corruption is successful, eliminates US CAs one by one until there
are none left to compel.
I don't think disabling auto-update is a good idea. What we need is secure
auto update.
This involves:
1) requiring multiple signatures on the update by people in different
2) Reproducible builds
3) A Certificate Transparency like log of all updates.
I believe TOR is doing some work on points 1) and 2).

No this idea isn't about proof of work. The idea is delaying the
computation result, preventing a miner from picking a value.
If the computation takes an hour on the fastest available computer and
isn't parallelizable, then a miner can't influence
the unpredictable value (unless they have 51%).
With slightly weaker security requirements iterating only a few
million times would be decent as well, since attempting to
influence the value would result in a performance hit a competitive
miner can't afford.

This can be avoided by running a sequential computation based on that
hash. For example
by hashing it 2^40 times. Obvious downside is that verifying that the
computation was performed
correctly is just as expensive (but parallelizable).
Perhaps there is a function that's sequential and slow in one
direction and fast in the reverse direction.

Have you considered a patent licence that applies to all open source
software, similar to Rogaway's OCB License 1?
It has a clause that the whole software needs to be open source, not
just the library, so it's similar to GPL in that regard.
But it enables use in a wider range of open source software which
doesn't use GPL.

Why would you use scrypt for anything except strengthening low entropy
secrets (like passwords)?
For high entropy secrets there are much simpler and cleaner
alternatives, such as HKDF.

The copyright holder can always dual-license it. In the case of text
secure it's a bit more complicated, but still the CLA allows OWS to
dual-license the code. So I wouldn't expect anything.

That'd only be the case for a naive collision finding attack. But
there are attacks that require little memory. Search for
"distinguished points".
