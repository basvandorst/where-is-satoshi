it's part of a valid mitigation strategy. shifting the target out from
underneath the blackholed address is also part of the activity. that's
easier in some cases than others. the bots will move and you play whack
a rat with your upstreams.

or you outsource it and it's still costlier.
Paying for DOS mitigation you rarely if ever use is quite expensive. If
you use it a lot it's even more expensive, but can at least be
rationalized on the basis of known costs e.g. npv calculation on the
number and duration of outages...

It may also be the case that your cloud service may be uncoupled from
the fate of your geography which may will allow it to survive a regional
failure that might otherwise render you inoperable.
All eggs in one basket is to my mind a bigger problem than who's basket
they're in.
If your network is wiped out it may not matter where the data is from an
availability perspective unless alternatives are in place.

The seriousness of crimes that can be committed using anonymization
services should not be diminished. That said the motive I had for
running a tor exit when I did was that speech, and in particular
political organization (dare we call it sedition) are in fact very
serious crimes in many places. R.g. they can result in indefinite
imprisonment, torture, judicial or extra-legal execution and so forth, I
don't consider that unserious..
The internet is potentially quite a useful tool for getting your message
out so long as using it isn't  holding a gun to your own head. While we
site here with the convenient idea of some legal arbitrage which allows
me to do something which isn't illegal  in my own domain to facilitate
something that is quite illegal elsewhere, the fact of the matter is if
you run a service like this you don't get to pick and choose.
