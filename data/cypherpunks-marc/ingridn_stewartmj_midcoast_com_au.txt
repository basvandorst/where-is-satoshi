Nathaniel Energy has a 51% ownership interest in a helium and gas processing
facility in Keyes, Oklahoma. This facility produces 2,000,000 mcf (thousand
cubic feet) of natural gas annually, 5,500 mcf of natural gas daily and
3,600 gallons of natural gas liquids daily.  Nathaniel Energy also acquired
a 130-mile pipeline that collects natural gas for the plant from over 50 gas
wells. The acquisition included a take-and-pay contract with Air Products
and Chemicals, Inc. for the helium production and an operating agreement
with Colorado Interstate Gas Company for the sale of processed natural gas.
The natural gas liquids recovered by the plant are sold to various parties.

AB0UT THE C0MPANY: Turning carbon based materials into inexpensive
electrical and thermal energy: Here is the sizzle.......
Nathaniel Energy provides industry with an alternative energy comparable to
that of fossil fuels. Its proprietary patented technology, the Thermal
Combustor(TM), is a 2-stage gasification system designed to combust waste,
biomass, tires and any other solid, carbon-based materials into inexpensive
electrical and thermal energy, while exceeding the most stringent EPA and
European Union regulations.

Str0ngly C0nsider The F0llowing P0ints:
*Many of these St0cks are all about Beaucoup Bucks in your wal-let. That's
pretty good in my book. You may not know a lot about inv'esting, but I'm sure
you can count.
**Many of these undiscovered st0cks are like "coiled springs", wound tighter
than a sling shot under the surface- And ready to Expl0de! This c0mpany is
unc0vered by wall street!
*As you can see from the examples given above, many of these small st0cks
perform very, very well for invest0rs who time them right. People who got in
on the examples above early Banked Many Times Their Inv'estment While Others
Were Trying to Figure Out Their Mutual Fund Sta'tements!
*Please Do Your H9mework on this C9mpany. You may agree that it has a shot
to make you some serious c'ash.....
Inf0rmation within this em-ail contains "f0rward l00king sta-tements" within
the meaning of Secti0n 27A of the Se-curities Act of 1933 and Secti0n 21B of
the Se-curities Exc-hange Act of 1934. Any st-atements that express or
inv0lve discussi0ns with respect to predicti0ns, expectati0ns, be.liefs, plans,
projecti0ns, 0bjectives, g0als, assumpti0ns or fu'ture events or perf0rmance
are not stat-ements of hist0rical fact and may be "f0rward l00king
sta-tements."F0rward l00king sta-tements are based on expectati0ns,
est-imates  and projecti0ns at the time the sta-tements are made that inv0lve
a number of ri'sks and uncer'tainties which could cause actual re-sults or
events to differ mat-erially from those presently ant-icipated. F0rward l00king
sta-tements in this acti0n may be iden-tified through the use of words such as
"pr0jects", "f0resee", "ex-pects", "will," "an-ticipates," "est'imates,"
"bel-ieves,"  "un-derstands" or that by st-atements indi-cating certain acti0ns
"may," "c0uld," or "might" 0ccur. As with many micr0cap st0cks, t0day's c0mpany
has additi0nal ri-sk fact0rs w0rth n0ting.The c0mpany has a g0ing c0ncern
0pinion from its audit0r, has relied on l0ans from 0fficers and an af'filiate
shareh0lder to pay exp-enses, has a large acc-umulated def'icit since its
incepti0n and is inv0lved in li-tigation in the n0rmal c0urse of its
bus'iness, none of which is ant-icipated to have a ma-terial adve-rse
ef-fect on its fi-nancial c0nditi0n, 0perati0ns or pr0spects. The C0mpany will
need to  0btain fin'ancing. There can be no assu-rance of that happening.
On July 2nd, the c0mpany announced it had terminated the Gasifier Supply and
Start-Up Ag'reement with L & R Energy, LLC ("L & R"), relating to the supply of
two 1800 BHP Thermal Combustors(TM) for a Refuse Derived Fuel pr0ject in
Cologna Veneta, Italy. Nathaniel Energy be'lieves it has 0pportunities to place
the two Thermal Combustors(TM),which were to be delivered under the ag'reement,
with other cust0mers, although it cannot a'ssure that it will be able to
reach any ag'reement to place these Thermal Combustors(TM). On June 7,2004,
Nathaniel Energy  issued a press rele'ase that its helium and gas pr0cessing
facility in Keyes, Oklahoma exp-erienced a fire, that there were no
injuries, and that repairs are underway. The Gr0wth St0ck Rep0rt does not
