Studio A: One of SIRIUS' 41 state-of-the-art studios where artists jam, perform live and get candid while being interviewed by our program hosts. At SIRIUS, we make satellite radio. And we do it right. That means 65 channels of music. And no commercials. None. Zilch. Zip. Zero. Plus we give you more than 50 channels of great sports, news and entertainment programming, much of it exclusive to SIRIUS.
It all starts at our studios in NYC's Rockefeller Center. On any given day as musicians stop by for live interviews and performances, our on-air hosts are hard at work taking satellite radio to the next level. The passion, the dedication, and the love of music contained in these walls are enough to change the way the world listens to music. Which is pretty much what we've set out to do. And we're doing it with satellites. Every second of the day, SIRIUS is shooting over 120 channels of amazing radio straight into the heavens to our three state-of-the-art satellites that rotate in figure eight, geo-synchronous orbits around the earth.
So every SIRIUS channel of satellite radio, over 120 of them, is available throughout the continental US with crisp digital-quality sound all down the line. You just can't find radio like this on any other dial.
You'll get exclusive access to 65 channels of the best 100% commercial-free music, plus 55 channels of sports, news and talk.. Get geared up for the future of music with SIRIUS. Our products keep you connected to the music and enter-tainment you love, no matter where you are. Your email address is cypherpunks
