That quote sounds like a FAUX news rather than ATF blunder.  FAUX news is
far down the Tim May Memorial Furnace Invitation list, and that faux pas
doesn't improve their ranking very much.
ATF is already near the top of the list.  Field agents are targets of
opportunity.  Their failure to be caught saying something stupid will not
save them from my wrath or Allah's.

What hath suddenly attracted our AUK creep?
