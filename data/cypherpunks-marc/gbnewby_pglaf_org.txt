Magazine.  For three days, hackers from around the world will convene
in New York City to share knowledge, debate, and seek ways to better
understand each other and the world we live in.  The Fifth Hope
organizers are seeking session topic proposals and speakers to be part
of the conference.
Topics related to all aspects of hackers and hacking are welcome.  In
past years, sessions have included these themes:
   * Social engineering
   * Lockpicking
   * Programming techniques
   * Hacker Ethics
   * Stories from K-12
   * Systems administration

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Hackers Track Visitors to New York City
New York, NY - May 15, 2008 - This summer, hackers from around the world will track the movements of thousands of visitors to New York City.
As part of a social experiment, attendees at a hacker conference in July will be issued badges with electronic tracking devices.  Large displays will show in real-time where people go, with whom they associate, for how long and how often.
The tracking technology, known as RFID, is fast becoming an unseen part of everyday life.  This July, for the very first time, the general public will be able to participate in the transparent operation of a major RFID tracking program.
Conference attendees will participate in games built around the tracking system.  Players will seek ways to protect their privacy, find vulnerabilities in the tracking system, employ data mining techniques to learn more about other participants, and choose how much personal information they will disclose in order to play.
This demonstration will be open to the public at The Last HOPE conference from July 18-20 Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. The first 1500 preregistrants will be guaranteed an RFID badge enabling them to participate in the game.  More information and preregistration is available at Contact: press

Mailman inserts all of these nice headers in the message envelope:
List-Id: The Cypherpunks Mailing List List-Unsubscribe: ,
List-Archive: List-Post: List-Help: List-Subscribe: ,
So, I don't think a separate footer is needed.
If your friend still has trouble subscribing, they can email me, or owner-cypherpunks which goes to me.
Also, the old domain redirects (email & Web) to the new domain.  So, it should not be possible any more to submit stuff to the old location.
Mailman is set to require a confirmation email, before subscribing.  Perhaps that confirmation message wasn't received?  If you want, I can grep the mail logs in for the friend's address, if troubles persist.
One difference from the old domain is that greylisting is turned on.  I haven't heard of that creating problems, but it is a difference.

According to a new report by Reuters citing anonymous intelligence officials, in 2015, Yahoo covertly built a secret âcustom software program to search all of its customers' incoming emails for specific information.â
Reuters noted that Yahoo âcomplied with a classified US government directive, scanning hundreds of millions of Yahoo Mail accounts at the behest of the National Security Agency or FBI, said two former employees and a third person apprised of the events.â It is not clear what data, if any, was handed over.

I will try to find a way to add these older items to the archives at  so it's findable there.  (I'm the guy who currently runs Mailman and the server there.) The .tar.bz2 file has 92,195 individual files.  I appended them all to a single file, which email clients can open as an mbox file.  But mailx reported 84519 messages, and mutt reported 84531.
I have temporarily put this combined file here, until I can add them to lists.cpunks.org somewhere under /var/lib/mailman:
All files concatenated as-is:
md5sum:  2a4ed20b98411cfd18c69765b21c30d2  cypherpunks-1999-2015.mbox
Presumably the other ~7664 files have something that gives the email clients I tried indigestion.  So I appended a blank line to each file, and then ran "formail -ds" on each file.  Now mailx reports and mutt(neomutt) reports 96969 messages.
All files concatenated after being "fixed" as described:
a08b619f3bcc92253dbd9140956c79ef  cypherpunks-1999-2015-fixed.mbox
There are four messages from pre-1999.  Then, lots from 1999 starting with:
  Date: Tue, 16 Mar 1999 02:32:36 -0800
  From: profrv (Matthew X)
  To: cypherpunks
  Cc: declan
  Subject: War on terra
There are messages going through 2016, and lots of messages with broken headers from formail.  It would take more work to "fix" whatever might be broken for all the files in the .bz2 work.  The 'nmh' email client might be helpful for this, since it uses individual files, rather than mbox files.
If anyone has ideas about how to create an improved mbox file (or simply provides one) I can add that to the lists.cpunks.org archive instead.  I will also add the .bz2 which provides individual files.  I'm glad that Riad had this older set!

For message below, mailman held the message because cypherpunks was bcc'd among a number of other To and Cc addresses.  If you just send it to the list, it is unlikely to be held up by mailman.

A follow-on to their launch of Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 resolver network, and coming to Firefox nightly builds.  ESNI makes sure the site component of HTTPS requests are encrypted, not just the payload.
The blog post says they were motivated by the April 2017 repeal of restrictions of ISPs gathering customer browsing.  When you visit an https site, the server needs to know the name of the site before SSL/TLS negotiation can start (at least, on a server that has multiple hostnames on the same IP address), because that is how the server knows which certificate to utilize.  ESNI goes beyond SNI (Server Name Indication), a 2003 IETF RFC.  The blog post talks about browser support.  It's not so clear what is required for Web servers and SSL certificates to make this work end-to-end for sites that are not hosted on Cloudflare.

Yeah, it looks like the list was unmoderated (i.e., open to any posting from any address) way back when.  I don't know when it became limited to subscribers only, but this is not a recent change.  If there is clamor for letting anyone from anywhere post without subscribing (perhaps with a few anti-spam provisions, like greylisting), we could consider it.  But hopefully the "fix" to getting a proper bounce message when a message doesn't go through will be sufficient.
We do have lots of people who change their email address frequently.  Also people who subscribe multiple addresses (setting some to "no mail") so they can post from different addresses.  This is completely unrestricted and automated, so it's quite easy for anyone who wants to to subscribe and then start posting immediately. The big archive of pre-2016 postings that was shared last month from was dominated by spam, it seems.

I figured this out easily: The problem is that Ric's address, wayward4now is not subscribed to the list.    Ric, subscribe here: The mystery, though, was why Ric didn't get a bounce.  It turns out the list was set to silently discard messages from non-subscribers, rather than reject (i.e., bounce) them.  So, from non-subscribers, this would look like the message was accepted, but it wasn't, and never got posted.
I have now found and changed the setting in Mailman ("generic_nonmember_action" under "Privacy options ... Sender filters").  Such messages will now instead be rejected.  So, people who post from an address that is not subscribed will get a message that the list is for subscribers only.  Certainly this is the expected behavior, rather than messages being accepted and then silently dropped.
It's not immediately clear to me whether I twiddled this setting myself, when we moved the lists, or this was already the setting from the old site when Riad managed the list.  Mea culpa, if I'm the guilty party.  I hope this config change addresses the anomalies that people have spotted recently, with some messages that appeared to be accepted for posting, but never got posted or archived.
Thanks for sending the full headers and other details shortly after the mishap.  That made it very easy to verify that Postfix/postgrey/etc. received the message properly and provided it to Mailman, but then Mailman didn't post it.  Best regards to all,

It looks like the DNS changeover worked ok. Please let me know of any anomalies...
The idea below of blocking the big ISPs is an interesting one. Back in the olden days, the Cypherpunks list was actually a meta list, with several different email servers that each had their own subscribers and handled message delivery for those subscribers. There could again be such a constellation of list servers, and some of those could opt to reject communications from some providers.

@_subject: Cypherpunks nameserver changes will happen Wednesday 
Dearest colleagues,
Riad and I are planning on coordinating some changes to the DNS entries for the cpunks.org domain, sometime during US business hours on May 1. Basically, we will be splitting out lists.cpunks.org (the PGLAF.org server, which I run and is where this list lives) as a subdomain in the DNS, separately from the rest of cpunks.org (which Riad runs, and mostly redirects to lists.cpunks.org anyway).
If the change goes well, nothing noticeable will happen and emails to the list will continue to flow.
If the change goes poorly, there might be some email messages that bounce or are delayed. I will send an email update to the list when the change is done, to test that things are working.
Once things have been working for a few days, I will then make some updates to the DNS records to improve adherence to modern email anti-spam "standards" (DKIM, SPF and DMARC). This should cut down on messages that are quarantined or rejected by many large email providers. Those anti-spam measures are a good topic for discussion. They have some merit in identifying the validity of the servers that messages come from. But they don't help with validating the sender, or non-repudiation, or other features that have existed at least as long as PGP. It's not easy to run your own mail transport agent these days. Here is a little article from some other victims of the behemoth ISPs: Best wishes for a Happy May Day, to all.    - Greg

Thanks for the discussion and input on the DNS hosting. I appreciate the knowledge and speculation of the group.
Another newsflash! I turned off CDN in Cloudflare. All traffic (web, email, and any other IP traffic) will go straight to the (only) server at 65.50.255.19, 2604:3200:0:3:21e:67ff:fe86:ff9c/64.
For the curious, this is a server that is owned by the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (a 501(c)3 charity that operates Project Gutenberg). I'm the long-time director & CEO. The server is a real physical server, not a VM or cloud-hosted. It hosts a few other domains, including companies of my wife & mother-in-law. Also our hobby site for dog mushing,  .. The server lives in a Castle Access facility in San Diego, but my hosting provider is johncompanies.com (it's their rack, and they provide excellent front-line support. Recommended).
The upstream connection is provided by Cogentco. All of the above could be discovered with a little sleuthing, and I thought the list subscribers might be interested.
Concerning Cloudflare: If there are recommendations for other free or cheap DNS providers, I'd like to hear them. I had used editdns and Zonedit for years, then the first was bought by DynDNS then by Oracle, and the second ceased operations. I prefer to have my domain WHOIS on one provider, my DNS with another provider, and then to run the server myself.
I still have other domains with Oracle's DNS service, which used to be DynDNS. They grandfathered "Lifetime" free service, and that lifetime is now ending: Oracle announced end-of-life for their free service as of May 2020. So, I need to move those other domains somewhere. Cloudflare offers a lot of capability at their free level, so that's what I tried with lists.cpunks.org Also, one other administrativia: The  is on a different server, different IP, and different nameserver. It just redirects to lists.cpunks.org right now, but Riad and I like having some division of services.
More on archives etc.:
My bad for not mentioning it. There are tons of features in Cloudflare, even at the free service level, and this one was on by default. I spent a little time twiddling it, and then left it on. This should have been disclosed to the list.
Anyway, it's now off, and I intend to leave it off. Other related features, like Javascript-based captchas, are options on top of the CDN, so none of that stuff will happen to our list.
The only reason I might consider turning it on temporarily in the future is if there is a DDoS against the server. Cloudflare has some great capabilities for intercepting attack traffic.
Yeah, I will try to look into this. I haven't set it up before, but instructions are out there. I agree this is a perfectly reasonable thing to do for the list.
Yes. I am overdue for doing this, and don't mind being periodically reminded.
If someone else wants to work on this type of thing, I can provide easy access to everything. Basically, we have a complete archive from 2013-present, and nearly complete from before that back to the earliest days. Though the older stuff is in mbox files that don't parse quite correctly, and have tons of spam.

Newsflash! This happened in April, and was announced here:
  We have been on Cloudflare's DNS since then for the email lists. I have shut their CDN on and off, and it's currently on. This means that their content distribution network does some caching of visits to  (i.e., the Mailman interface to list archives etc.).
But the CDN doesn't handle emails. Those go through the (only) server for the list, which is also known as PGLAF.org.
In olden days of cypherpunks, there was a distributed list delivery via multiple servers. These days, it's on the single server, managed by the Mailman software. The server has the usual array of anti-spam measures like graylisting, SPF, DKIM and DMARC. But it's not that hard to spoof another user... if there are problems, I can dig into them a bit via the server logs.
And, if people think we should turn off the Cloudflare CDN, I can do that easily enough. It is not very relevant for us, other than perhaps making it a bit faster for people who are harvesting the list archives from somewhere that the CDN is faster than the (GigE) network that PGLAF.org sits on.

Sorry about that! I screwed up the DNS for the PGLAF server, and basically had IPv6 partially configured.
I think it's now fixed. The good news is dual stack (IPv6 and IPv4) is now enabled. Why was I making changes? Because the afore-mentioned lifetime free service from Oracle emailed me on July 16, saying that I was using too many DNS queries. It wasn't clear whether they would bill me, or just refuse to handle requests beyond the number allowed. So, I moved pglaf.org to Cloudflare, but neglected to move all of the entries. Plus I created a nice new IPv6 entry for Mail Exchange (MX record) but didn't configure Postfix to actually utilize IPv6.
So, my fault. Let me know of any other anomalies... I hope that there were proper bounce messages, for anything that didn't get through.

Sorry for my slow response. I purposely waited an extra day+ in case there are any other complaints or signs of trouble. Also, maybe you got a response back form cock.li already?
This is mostly just my response to Juan, but what's below might be of general interest for anyone who has had trouble getting messages to or from the list:
The man page says it is 35 days.
In your experience, this means that if a message is posted (same triplet of IP, sender, recipient) it should not be greylisted unless 35 days have passed since the prior message was sent.
One thing that happens a lot with big companies is that they use a bunch of different IP addresses. That creates problems for greylisting, since the triplet is not duplicated, so keeps getting greylisted. I did not see evidence that cock.li is doing this, though: they just have two MX servers, and the addresses seem static.
Yes, it's the exact same system, with the exact same software, configuration, etc.
I can provide you a GMail-type address to contact me, if your messages aren't getting through.
Actually, your address is: punks (I just confirmed that is what appears in the subscriber list, and that is the address you used).
The list configuration is that emails from unknown/unsubscribed addresses are rejected (i.e., bounced: you will get a copy back).
So, if you ever send from a different address, it will not be posted. And it will be bounced back. It's possible your email client or the cock.li MTA is not getting a bounce to you... to test this, try sending to cypherpunks from a non-subscribed address, and then chase down the bounce.
(Of course, it will get greylisted first! Even before Mailman sees + bounces it.)
I can check the logs for the non-subscribed address, if you experiment with this and don't get a bounce.
Either works. The DNS MX sends it to the same server.
Maybe. You can check the archives to confirm.
Or maybe it's only addresses that are not actually deliverable. There are dozens of throwaway addresses that were created & subscribed, and now just bounce, in the subscriber list. Those are stuck in their own twilight zone, until Mailman eventually auto-unsubscribes them. This always takes at least a week (that is the Mailman list setting), and since cpunks@ is a busy list, that can result in many dozens of retries by the MTA.
Yes - my note just above.
My pleasure.

@_subject: Re: Postgrey (Re: impersonating Juan, a quick test) 
More below. I bet some other people have run into this type of problem, but might not have realized it is a pattern. I'm sure it is more evident to you, due to your prolific correspondence with cypherpunks
That exactly explains the symptoms of greylisting.
I found lots of log entries where your messages were accepted:
Jul 12 13:13:31 mail postgrey[2135]: action=pass, reason=triplet found, client_name=mx1.cock.li, client_address=185.10.68.5, sender=punks recipient=cypherpunks
(185.10.68.5 is mx1.cock.li)
The first time a message arrives, the triplet "CLIENT_IP" / "SENDER" / "RECIPIENT" had not been seen before within postgrey's memory. So, it sends a message back to try again later.
And then, a few minutes later, the MTA tries again and the message is delivered.
IF one of the triplet elements is changed, it does not immediately get delivered since it gets greylisted again.
BTW, there are subscribers to cypherpunks@ who like to change their email addresses, or add alternate subscription addresses. No problem, but postgrey will not deliver on the first attempt.
And I didn't get the copy you sent me directly:
mail.log:Jul 15 12:19:38 mail postgrey[2135]: action=greylist, reason=new, client_name=unknown, client_address=xxxx, sender=punks recipient=gbnewby
the MTA didn't try again! (I.e., there was not a second entry for this triplet, as of 40+ minutes later).
 *** ALSO, and this is important: I see at least three different email address you are using. punk@ punks@ and another. All those from punks@ went through to cypherpunks none were delayed in the past few days of logs.
Meanwhile, cock.li's nameserver shows two MX (mail exchange) servers. One of them, mx2.cock.li isn't responding, and there are some pending bounces to other addresses (not yours) that cannot be delivered. mx1 is the primary, though, and that is what your messages seem to be using.
Bottom line: There is some evidence that the cock.li mail transport agents are not working correctly for greylisting, at least not all of the time. If you are in communication with those folks, perhaps you could raise some concerns. You can feel free to put me in touch, if that might help.
Other Bottom Line: Make sure you use your subscribed address, punks to send to cypherpunks
And finally, I do see messages of this form in the logs:
Jul  8 08:28:14 mail postfix/smtp[29664]: 38E7411C603C: host mx1.cock.li[185.10.68.5] refused to talk to me: 421 4.7.0 cock.li Error: too many connections from 65.50.255.19
This seems to be from when a message to cypherpunks@ is delivered to various addresses hosted there. They have many different domains, and postfix is not smart enough to bundle them all into a single delivery. Result can be a dozen or more connections within just a second or so, which could legitimately trigger some anti-abuse response. Although, again, these should either generate a bounce, or be retried.
Sorry for the trouble. It seems there might be some configuration problems (and it's certainly possible that my PGLAF server is not configured quite right!), and also that both cock.li and pglaf.org servers have some relatively unforgiving configurations.

@_subject: Postgrey (Re: impersonating Juan, a quick test) 
In case this helps: Just yesterday I sent a longish message about the server setup for the system that is hosting this cypherpunks@ list.
One of the components is postgrey (which I misspelled postgray). When a message arrives from an unknown host, Postfix rejects it with a message to try again later. This is extremely effective against hit-and-run spam and similar annoyances.
I've found that there are lots of organizations that do not follow the RFCs for email properly, and do not try again. Lots of banks and ecommerce sites seem to write their own mail transport agent (MTA), and do not try again after getting the postgrey message.
It seems possible this is what's happening to your messages. If your service is using an MTA that doesn't try again - or if it tries again, but from a different IP address - the message might not get through. You should get a bounce saying it couldn't be delivered (anywhere from 30 minutes to 7 days later), but organizations that write their own MTAs might not handle error delivery that well, either.
If you have a message that doesn't seem to get posted, please forward me the message and I'll mine the logs to see what happened. There are plenty of other possibilities that might cause this, but postgrey is one that we can investigate easily enough.

I'm still intending to get the archives from 1992-2015 up on the site, and will need to set up a new list to test integration.
It's possible we will need a second list just for those archives. This is because there are thousands of messages with bad headers, and I'm concerned that Mailman might (a) get direly confused, (b) intersperse old messages with new messages, or otherwise break the more recent archives. If this is happening, it might be better to have a separate list, just for the older archives.
What I'm talking about is a nice browsable archive (by date, thread...), in addition to by-month mbox files as well as the multi-year mbox files.
But if it can all be integrated, I will do as you suggest below and have the main site to go the (only) list, rather than to a listing of one list.
Stay tuned... I've been plugging away at processing the archives, and hope to get something ready for review in the next couple of weeks. It's around 92,000 messages in a little over 500MB. (My personal first posting to the list in the archive was from September 2000: 19 years ago!)

It seemed like a well-researched article. I was expecting it to be an audio story, but it's written.
It includes a 3-page FBI report on the HOPE conference, which was fun to read. (Disclaimer: I was the one who shepherded Adrian for the panel the article mentions; Also, I introduced him for another session, where he screened the "Hackers Wanted" film.)
The HOPE security people gave him very good support, making sure he was not physically threatened. But people were very, very vocal about their negative views on him as a snitch. As described in the article.
I always thought he was a sad character: lonely, and marching to the beat of a different drummer. The "Hackers Wanted" film supports this view.
The article has a hand-written note from Chelsea saying she holds no ill will towards Adrian - this was from just the past few days. Given the deception by Adrian from their chat session, way back pre-arrest, I'm surprised by this. Adrian clearly believed, in that instance and others, that the ends justified the means.
The timing of this NPR article is due to Adrian's extradition hearing, scheduled for February 2020. With Chelsea refusing to witness for the feds (and spending time in jail as a penalty for this contempt of court), Adrian might have been a key witness for events around the disclosure of secure documents, and their eventual ingestion to Wikileaks.
But that's another story. Is there a US judge who will believe that trying to brute force a Windows password is espionage? Stay tuned...

I'll make some obvious statements that I haven't seen in this thread yet (apologies if I missed them):
Verifiable functionality means that the software, wherever it's deployed, can be trusted (to whatever extent is needed). This is challenging for any software, and more challenging when you need to worry about the entire stack including the hardware.
Trustable deployment means that we can validate the nodes in the mesh, to whatever extent is needed. This is a perpetual issue with TOR, because players can do things antithetical to the design (such as collusion or surveillance).

@_subject: Assange "fails in bid to delay extradition battle with US" 
Spotted in Fox news online, but it looks like this is also on the AP wire
Meanwhile, it appears Chelsea Manning is still in jail in Alexandria, for refusing to cooperate with the grand jury investigation against Assange: The Fox article:
WikiLeaksâ Julian Assange fails in bid to delay extradition battle with US
Greg Norman
By Greg Norman | Fox News
Will Julian Assange be extradited to the US?
The Department of Justice charges WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in 18-count superseding indictment; Catherine Herridge reports.
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange came up short Monday in a bid to delay his extradition to the United States to face espionage charges.
Assange, who appeared with his legal team at the Westminster Magistrates Court in London, failed to convince District Judge Vanessa Baraitser that a delay in the already slow-moving case was justified, The Associated Press reported.
Assange, who hasnât been seen in public for several months since his dramatic arrest inside Britain's Ecuadorian embassy, appeared with his silvery-gray hair slicked back and wore a blue sweater and blue sport coat for the hearing. At one point, he defiantly raised a fist to acknowledge supporters who jammed the public gallery in the courtroom.
The U.S. is seeking to bring Assange overseas to face espionage charges. The full hearing to decide his extradition is still set for a five-day period in late February, with brief interim hearings in November and December.

After the judge turned down the bid for a three-month delay, Assange said he didn't understand the events in court.
He said the case is not "equitable" because the U.S. government has "unlimited resources" while he doesn't have easy access to his lawyers or to documents needed to prepare for his battle against extradition due to his confinement in Belmarsh Prison, on the outskirts of London.
"They have all the advantages," the 48-year-old Assange said.
U.S. authorities accuse Assange of scheming with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to crack a password that provided access to classified material on a government computer.
Assange's lawyer, Mark Summers, told the judge more time was needed to prepare his client's defense because the case has many facets -- including the very rare use of espionage charges against a journalist, as Assange defines himself -- and requires a "mammoth" amount of planning and preparation.
"Our case will be that this is a political attempt to signal to journalists the consequences of publishing information," he said. "It is legally unprecedented."

BRITISH COURT SETS 2020 DATE FOR ASSANGE EXTRADITION HEARING
Summers also accused the U.S. of illegal actions during its investigation, including illegally spying on Assange while he was inside the Ecuadorian Embassy seeking refuge.
"The American state has been actively engaged in intruding into privileged discussions between Mr. Assange and his lawyers in the embassy, also unlawful copying of their telephones and computers [and] hooded men breaking into offices," he said.
Summers did not provide evidence of these claims, which likely would be part of Assange's defense against extradition when the full hearing is held next year.
Summers said the initial case against Assange was prepared during the administration of former President Barack Obama in 2010 but wasn't acted on until Donald Trump assumed the presidency. He said it represents the administration's aggressive attitude toward whistleblowers.
Attorney James Lewis, representing the U.S., opposed any delay to the proceeding.
The public gallery was jammed with Assange supporters, including former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, and outside the courthouse, some chanted demanding Assange be freed while others carried placards calling for his release.
The judge said the full hearing will be heard at Belmarsh Court, which is adjacent to the prison where Assange is being held. She said this would be easier for Assange to attend and contains more room for the media.
Former Home Secretary Sajid Javid had signed an order in June allowing Assange to be extradited.

Jim, others:
Archives were discussed in the list awhile ago, a few times. Riad had some, and so did another source.
I have a copy here:
  (a few different versions)
The "to do" item is to slurp the archives so they are all findable among the other archives at  .. I will eventually do this. I looked at the Yahoo! Groups archives mentioned in this list a couple of weeks ago, and they seemed to be the same thing: just a long-time "subscriber" to the list.

@_subject: List administrivia (Re: Whom, specifically, is our greatest ally? - (spoiler: Australia)) - [PEACE] 
1. MISSING MESSAGES THIS WEEK
Jim: I set your list options to select "ACK" and unselected "nodupes." The impact is that you should get an email acknowledgment whenever a message is accepted and (presumably) distributed and archived. The "nodupes" might have no impact, but it is supposed to quash multiple copies of messages when selected.
Because you sent multiple emails to the list today, I don't have an easy way to check whether there was some sort of problem (like a spam-type rejection) from one of them. If you are ever suspicious that something got blocked or didn't make it, AND can tell me the specific time, I can check the logs. As I have mentioned here before, the PGLAF.org server that runs lists.cpunks.org has graylisting and a few other anti-spam measures. But clearly most of your messages are being handled correctly.
Anyone else who wants to twiddle their list settings can visit  (and Jim can email me to revert what's above, if desired).
2. MISSING MESSAGES FROM 1995
As has already been written, the PGLAF server has only hosted the list since around August of 2016. Previously, Riad Wahby hosted the list. I first subscribed in the early 2000s. The archive copies I have at    came from a couple of other people.
For anyone looking at those copies, note that the mbox files have some problems (spam, and some messages with bad headers that can confuse or even crash email clients).
It is clear in these archives that the messages that Jim says do not exist, do not exist. There is no obvious evidence of redaction. For example, I wondered whether there would be responses to messages that Jim posted, but not the original messages. I didn't find any. Ditto for the messages from Bill Frezza.
  ** IF YOU FIND OTHER (different) COPIES of the archive, please get them to me and I'll add them to what's above.
In the early 2000s, the list existed via a series of "cypherpunks distributed remailers" (CDRs). It is absolutely true that the content from each CDR was different: different headers, different time stamps, and different spam. I do not know the provenance of the copies above. I can tell you that I didn't edit/redact them (a README tells what I did to eventually ingest alongside lists.cpunks.org archives). I agree with Jim's suggestion that we seek other copies of archives, or individuals who might have a complete personal archive from them. Some of the long-departed CDR admins like Jim Chote and John Gilmore might have such records. If anyone knows who was running CDRs in the 1992-1997 period, I will be happy to reach out to them.

Those are the same as what I have at  (other than line endings: they are not identical files, but the contents seems to be the same).
The Cryptome files are dated 2009, and the ones I have were dated 2003.
The other archive referenced below is:  .. I did a quick perusal of 1995/11 and the contents seem to match the two sources above.
You probably already looked here:  (the first hit in Google for "archive of cypherpunks email list"). Seems the same. Notably, 1995 has no archives for April or June 1995 in any of these three copies of the archive. So, they seem to match at a coarse grain, at least.

@_subject: Re: Facebook is deleting the name of the potential whistleblower 
Empirical confirmation confirming the deletion in Facebook: I'm part of a public group where the group admin posted an image of the transcript where the name appears, "without comment." So, the name was in the image, but not written. That was Saturday night, US eastern time.
Sunday morning, the posting is gone. I had commented on the posting, and now the links in my FB notification feed that go to the comments are also gone (i.e., Facebook "comment_id" and "notif_id" strings in the posting URLs simply redirect to the group's main page).
Sunday morning, the same person started a new thread that talks about the deletion. Depending on the interest in the group of experimenting, perhaps we will also talk about the topic of the post that was deleted, or other details. That could help to determine whether the deletion was automated, based on obvious trigger terms (via automated optical character recognition), or manual by the FB watchdog corps. It seems possible that automated deletion would then lead to ongoing manual oversight. MEANWHILE, this also got me thinking about archives deletion. You can find this thread in the monthly archives at  and more specifically starting with Jim's posting, here: Jim has identified gaps in the available copies of the Cypherpunks list archives from 2003, and so far we haven't found earlier archives that contain the redacted materials. Deletions would have occurred sometime after postings in 1995 or so.
How easy would it be for a state actor to remove archives from the current server? Very easy: they simply need to show up at the data center with a national security letter, login via console, and take care to erase their tracks. It's possible the intrusion would be detected by the server admin or someone else, but also possible it would not be noticed until any evidence trail has long gone cold.
My understanding (I wasn't there) was that this type of scenario was part of the inspiration for cypherpunks distributed remailers. We no longer have a distributed architecture. More importantly, the CP community isn't maintaining resilient no-delete archives. I'll give some thought to how I might contribute to such an architecture, perhaps starting simply by an additional offsite backup. The current list server could add a few controls, like checksums and even encrypted copies of the archive. But without distributing copies elsewhere, and publicizing information about the controls for data integrity and availability, the risk would persist.

@_subject: Re: cypherpunks-legacy archives 1992-2013 
My pleasure. Those gnarly mbox files were more of a challenge than I had anticipated at first.
Yes, that was easy enough: Done. Note also that the Apache server should be offering capable clients to compress on-the-fly as part of the HTTP negotiation (gzip).
The 1992-1998 archives were already part of a bzip2: cypherpunks-199209-199812.tar.bz2 (John has shared essentially the same files as a .zip), so I didn't make a .xz of it.
I made an .xz of the cypherpunks-legacy.mbox (i.e., the exact input to the 'arch' command). Also cypherpunks-1999-2015.mbox (the archive from before Mailman, and the first ~2 years of Mailman), and also the processed/ directory (i.e., post-processed stuff that was input to the first file in this paragraph).
I also made sha512sum output in sha512sum.txt (I could also make md5sum, but that is no longer considered cryptographically secure, according to its man page).
Direct links:
  (this is what you asked for, I think).
Let me know if other variations would be useful.
It's no problem to point wget or whatever at the server, if you want to copy some or all of these files (including the browse-by-thread etc.).
For completeness and so everyone gets a copy, here are the sha512sums:

@_subject: cypherpunks-legacy archives 1992-2013 
Back in July there was discussion about preserving the available archives. I have now made the available archives from 1992-2013 available via Mailman, and placed copies of the available mbox files within.
Visit them here:
 The main info page, which links to the sources and a description of what was involved in getting them into Mailman, is here:
 Finally, here is the README-processing file that describes what I did, and why I decided to not try to incorporate those older archives with the current list archives at   Suggestions welcome. Processing of Cypherpunks Archives
Available archives of the Cypherpunks email list are incomplete, and
in fact there is evidence they have been tampered with and/or redacted
over the years. This project was to do some basic clean-up of available archives,
which are in mbox format, so that they could be ingested and be viewed
within Mailman.
The archives contain many poorly formed messages, and Mailman defaults
to the current date (December 2019, at the time of this writing) when
it encounters a problem with the date. So, a separate
'cypherpunks-legacy' list was deployed to make the archives available
without overlapping with the current active 'cypherpunks' list, which
goes back to July 20 2013. Otherwise, the legacy archive messages
would have been peppered into the current archives, in ways that would
be difficult to predict or undo.
There were especially many anomalies from the larger source, spanning
1999-2015. In addition to many poorly formed messages (i.e., messages
that, in one way or another, could not be cleanly ingested with the
Mailman 'arch') comment, there were invalid dates, and lines that had
an errant "From " at the start.
To ready the sources for ingestion to Mailman two automated tools were
utilized, followed by some ad hoc edits and changes:
1. 'sortmbox.py' uses a Python library to put messages in by-date
order. This proved to be less confusing to Mailman (i.e., fewer messages
were inserted to the current month).
2. 'cleanarch' (/var/lib/mailman/bin/cleanarch) is part of the Mailman
package. It fixes errant "From " entries at the start of lines.
3. I also used 'sed' to replace invalid dates with valid ones that
were in the same ballpark day+time as the message. I found these either
when 'arch' complained (such as for dates before the Unix epoch), or
when Mailman was showing messages in the future:
's/ 0101 / 1999 /' | sed 's/ 0102 / 1999 /'
's/Thu Dec 31 22:40:39 1903/Thu Jul  5 22:40:39 2018/g'
's/Jan 1904/Jul 2018/'
's/Date: Sun, 1 Apr 2029 03:07:16 +0200/Date: Sat, 31 Mar 2001 15:59:46 -0800/'

There might have been a few other small edits made within the files,
which I didn't record, simply to help Mailman to do a better job of
creating browsable archives.
4. I then concatenated all the mbox files (one each for 1992-1998, plus
one larger file for 1999-2015), and reran sortmbox.py and cleanarch.
5. I edited the resulting file to remove everything after the new list
archives were set up, on July 20 2013.
To do the work above, I created a temporary Mailman list, and repeatedly
used the 'arch' command to ingest the archives and fix problems. This
was an iterative process.
Once 'arch' was giving sane output, I created a new Mailman list,
'cypherpunks-legacy.' I put the single unified + fixed mbox file where
Mailman tools would find it:
  /var/lib/mailman/archives/public/cypherpunks-legacy.mbox/cypherpunks-legacy.mbox
At this point, I could use the Mailman to slurp the mbox files in, and
create the browsable structure.
The 'arch' command:
  /var/lib/mailman/bin/arch --wipe cypherpunks-legacy
This served to populate the list archives, which are browsable here:
  The single large mbox file resulting from the steps above is linked at
the top of the Archives page. Here is a direct link:
   (615MB, containing approximately 180149 messages)
Please be aware that Mailman's placement of messages by author, date,
subject and thread - including the correct by-month folder - is not
perfect. Messages sometimes end up in the wrong place, and sometimes
threads are split across different years.
Also note that these mbox files did not include attachments. The
current Mailman archive does include attachments, but this legacy
archive does not. It seems they were not included with the archive
input sources (though it's possible some messages have MIME-encoded
attachments within them).
Anyone interested in doing a serious dig into the archive should also
consult the original mbox files. These can be ingested into any
capable email client program, and viewed as separate messages. They
may be sorted and searched, just like any other email folder.
The same sorts of issues as those described above will likely be
evident in any email client, and clients will even show a different
total number of messages. The types of sorting, editing, and displaying
described above would have somewhat different results, if a different
toolset is used.
These archives are freely available, and the effort to make them
available via Mailman is freely given.  - gbn

Yes, exactly. There are some notes about sources, linked in via the listinfo page.
Correct. The venona .zip contents I used are dated 2003. Cryptome has a copy dated 2010 that is only different by a few bytes.
We have not heard of other archives covering 1992-1998. All the other online archives seem to trace back to the same source.
Something that is unfortunate about this is that, at the time, there were a bunch of different remailers (the number varied over time, but seems to have typically been around a half-dozen). Each CDR's archive would have been different: different spam, different headers and slight variations in time stamps. It seems that none of the other CDR archives are available, at least publicly. Only the venona one. This is part of why Jim has been reaching out to some of those CDR operators, and also long-time list subscribers. Any other archive would be expected to have material differences, at least with headers & spam.
BTW, I joined the list in 2001, at the tail of the period above (and was on a couple of different CDRs over time). In the quest for archives from the 1990s I am an interested party, but not a source of any original materials.

Dear Tom,
You might be interested to see that I recently merged the archives. (I am the current list operator.) You can find it browsable and a few other formats. This spans September 1992-July 2013 in the cypherpunks-legacy collection. The current (ongoing) list is in the main cypherpunks collection, from 2013-present. They are both here:

Yes, exactly. Check your spam filters etc. in case messages to you are eaten by your own mail system. Mail deliver to & from the PGLAF server that hosts lists.cpunks.org seems to be robust (i.e., I get notifications about various bounces etc., and there are surprisingly few problems).
Note especially that GMail and probably a few other web-based interfaces *refuse* to show you a copy of your own posting, even if it arrives in your inbox.
At  you can use your personal subscriber password (or ask for it to be set/sent), to turn on an automated acknowledgment for every message you send. There are a few other settings you can tweak there, too.
But the bottom line is: check the archive, above (no login/password required), to confirm whether your message was posted to the list.
There used to be a few situations where messages were silently rejected (such as when having too many cc: or to: recipients). I think we have now set things so that anything that is received, but not posted, will generate some sort of message back to the posting address. In other words, rejection or moderation or other failures to post SHOULD result in an email back to you explaining what happened.

The cypherpunks list has only allowed subscribers to post since it moved to Mailman (i.e., years ago). When non-subscribers try to post, they get an automated response.
At least some of the Cypherpunks Distributed Remailers (CDRs) and predecessor lists allowed anyone to post, as evidenced by the massive quantities of spam in the cypherpunks-legacy archive (now at My recollection (from later years of CDRs, when I joined) was that some CDRs restricted to subscribers. But some did not. And all CDRs would allow all traffic from all other CDRs (more or less...).   - Greg

I just watched an informative talk from 36C3 by Julian Oliver:
 At around minute 28 he begins talking about the specific server software, datacenter hosting, and other aspects of their operational security implementation. This description goes to around minute 44, and then there is some Q&A that is also quite informative.
Nobody asked him why they didn't use TOR -- presumably it wasn't even a contender. For sysadmin activity they use VPNs to countries with strict data protection laws (Switzerland and Iceland are mentioned). Data partitions are encrypted, and they have various contingency plans in the event a server is seized. At around minute 34, there is a list of the different software choices they made to support Extinction Rebellion. They chose alternatives to Slack, Google, Mailchimp, Zoom, etc. Some were found to be better than the better-known alternatives, and some were worse, for performance, scalability and usability. He mentioned that modern users are looking for something like a Google-based single sign-on, which is anathema to the anti-surveillance infrastructure they are focusing on.
The software and configuration choices are today's best-of-breed for making surveillance and seizure more difficult. This naturally includes not utilizing commercial solutions, and also naturally includes self-hosting the infrastructure.
ER is a global movement that is highly decentralized and, according to the first 28 minutes of the talk, is having an impact. This is primarily through non-violent actions. They mainly seek progress on combating climate change.  or  for more info.

I will be upgrading the main pglaf.org server starting the morning of Saturday, April 11 (by around 10am Eastern Daylight Time).
During this time, the Cypherpunks list and archives will be unavailable:
  No email will be sent out. Incoming email will be queued or deferred. Let me know if you have any questions about what will be unavailable. This upgrade should not impact any of the behaviors of the services, once they are restored.

Content-Disposition: inline
Hi, Doug. Just last week, the ACM came out with a thorough and interesting guide on how to run a virtual conference:
  They link to an open Google Doc that lists lots of different resources and their characteristics:
  There are also a number of other useful links and appendices. There is no easy answer to the choice, since all the tools have limitations. They don't dig much into security and privacy aspects, but do have focus on how to restrict access only to registered persons.
Another resource is something I posted to cpunks about earlier. I'm attaching the email I sent. It was a CCC talk that described the different software they used. Mastadon & Jitsi were highlighted, among others.
Jitsi has a key limitation in how the video streams are sent, which makes larger meetings a problem due to bandwidth management - I experienced this myself, where a meeting with 10-12 people fell apart because attendees were getting dropped, or couldn't receive all the participant streams.
Another personal experience I have is with Slack. Slack is actually pretty good for live audio/video meetings of 10 or so people. The nice thing is that if you're already having an ongoing Slack chat, you can launch a "call" any time in the same channel.
It's nice to hear from you. Enjoy!
 Greg

@_subject: List broken; now fixed 
Apologies that the list was bouncing all day today (after around 9am US Eastern Daylight Time).
I botched a setting in Postfix, and didn't realize it until 13 hours later!
It looks like anyone who submitted to the list would have received a bounce message (complaining about spamc), and the message was not received or processed. You'll need to resend if you want the message to go to the cypherpunks list.
The good news is I had a pleasant day outdoors, out and about (alone!) on the trails where I live. Rather than sitting in front of my computer all day. The bad news is it was evident in about 2 seconds that something was wrong, when I checked my mail, because I had not received any messages since this morning. Not even spam!
Mea culpa. Things now seem to be fixed. Let the conversation continue!

Possibly useful advice for  users below, also some list diagnostics:
That was a temporary 13-hour problem caused by a specific misconfiguration I applied. There is no indication that mail delivery problems before that are related.
There were a ton of bounces from  (there are several subscribers, not only you).
I suspect that this WAS due to the misconfiguration I did, but I didn't save the 450+ bounce notifications.
You should be able to reenable your subscription as directed... let me know if you run into trouble.
Here's the important part (saved for the end):
For  users, I experimented by subscribing a gmail address to the list.
I found that MOST (not quite all) messages were flagged as spam and therefore did not arrive in my inbox.
I flagged as "not spam" to extract them from the spam folder, which might train gmail.
But the approach I suggest is to create a filter in gmail. This is easy in the Web interface, but I don't know about other clients. Simply make a filter so that messages with "list:(cypherpunks.lists.cpunks.org)" or to/cc cypherpunks are never flagged as spam.

Yes, that's what it does. Or is supposed to do.
Do you mean, AFTER I sent my note above? Or before? The fix I applied was supposed to reset everyone, so nobody needs to manually reset.
Perhaps I didn't do what I thought, but it looked like all subscribers were set to again receive mail, and any previous bounces were forgotten.

Accidental indeed! You are right, Karl, that many had mail messages disabled.

I've now reset ALL the mailman "bounce scores," so hopefully people are getting this message even if they were temporarily held. Sorry I didn't see this problem earlier - I don't have mailman set to send notifications when a bouncing address' email is temporarily disabled.
