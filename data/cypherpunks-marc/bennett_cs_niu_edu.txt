     No, but throughput surely slows down because it has to compete with the
directory mirror outflow.
     I have no idea.
     It is usually less than one day, thanks to the crappy ISP I signed up
     If we all did that, then where would we get directory service?

to believe that the Chinese government is allowing the NSA to control IP
addresses allocated to, and served inside, China.  It makes no sense at all,

     Well, you seem to be getting ahead of things here, which would have
been more apparent if you hadn't deleted all the context.  I would like
to know first before worrying about automating a remedy whether anyone
else is experiencing the same problem.  If my tor server is the only one
being attacked, then the problem may not rise to the necessity of an
automated solution.  If anyone else is seeing this problem, please let
us know.
     Also, you didn't identify the scripts to which you refer clearly
enough that I have any idea what they might be.  What do they do?  Where
can they be found?
     Up till now, I've only added two filter rules on the router to block
anything from the two offending /24 nets from getting into my LAN.  Keeps
the LAN traffic down, as well as the outbound link traffic.  Very simple,
no checking of protocol, port, or destination IP address required, etc.
But it does require my presence to notice something fishy going on, check
it out more carefully, and then add a filter rule.

A little while ago, I added another filter rule to the router here to
stop an apparently endless, rapid-fire series of directory requests hitting
my tor server's DirPort from 125.35.9.66, which appears to be in China.  The
last time I reported this type of thing, you may recall, it came from a site
in Italy.  The symptom, like the last time, was that output rate on my
machine's main Ethernet interface was running steadily around the transmit
rate limit imposed by my ADSL line.  dig(1) shows:

finding their tor servers being hit like this, then perhaps we need to think

is that running a server helps to hide your client's traffic by mixing it
in with all the traffic relayed for others.  Another is that each server's

circuits for your own to be concealed among.
     The problem of corrupted exit servers is indeed one that we should all
ponder until a solution may be found.  However, setting up, say, 1,000 hidden,
slaved, correctly configured tor servers via a bot net may be rather more
difficult to accomplish than you have fully considered.  Entry guards and
middlemen probably wouldn't be useful to an attack coordinator.
     Again, I think you may well be underestimating the manpower required to

@_subject: Re: (micro)payments for anonymous routing in Tor? 
On Wed, 24 Sep 2008 03:44:39 -0400 "Josh Albrecht"      Relay operators already get an advantage that client-only users
don't have:  their own traffic is mingled into relay traffic at the
outset, often making it difficult for an observer to know that the relay
operator is even conducting any client operations him/herself.
     I have to comment here that all of the foregoing discussion gives me
the impression that implementing such a system would add considerable
overhead to the tor network.  If people are complaining about slowness
now, then why would anyone want to add to the overhead?  The total
throughput of the tor network would not be increased by a priority system,
and it's conceivable that it might be decreased a bit due to the extra
overhead, especially where that overhead incurs extra network traffic.
     Well, I don't know about any actual method of attack, but using such
a system would seem to reduce anonymity by partitioning traffic into traffic
belonging to those who can "pay" (relay operators) and traffic belonging to
those who cannot (non-relay (i.e., client-only) operators).  The two groups
are likely to be unequal in size, probably with the client-only group being
the larger of the two.  Thus the anonymity set is reduced in each group from
that of the original, overall population, with that reduced set size modified
in the relay operator group by a trade-off between relative anonymity and
performance based upon the data relay rates of their servers.
     Let's examine that last statement a bit closer.  Relay operators are
probably a small subset of the overall user population, so distinguishing
one's traffic as being that of a relay operator by getting a higher priority
for the traffic probably vastly decreases one's anonymity from the current
level.  However, the data rates among servers vary widely and are not
uniformly distributed.  Servers with published peak data rates
greater than, for example, 4,000 KB/s are very few in number.  Such a "paid"
system would essentially guarantee that the traffic of operators of those
servers would have a high priority all the time because they would be unlikely
ever to use much of their accumulated credit.  That means those folks could
download huge files, always at a high priority, which might make their traffic
more identifiable as being possibly/probablytheir traffic.  (This kind of
traffic analysis problem is really way out of my area, though, so I feel quite
in the dark as to how useful such distinctions might actually be to an
attacker with great resources at its disposal.)  Would the cost in anonymity
of running a high-data-rate relay encourage some operators to reduce their
servers' data rates artificially to keep their client-side traffic from
originating from such a shrunken anonymity set?  E.g., would blutmagie get
a RelayBandwidthRate of, say, 500 KB/s (i.e., < 10% of its typically published
peak rates) in order to improve the operator's anonymity?
     Meanwhile, the client-only users would get reduced anonymity and poorer
performance, but their anonymity, at least, is not reduced anywhere nearly as
much as that of the relay operators.  So the introduction of such a system
certainly makes the situation much more interesting, but not necessarily in a
way that makes tor's behavior any easier for users, naive or advanced, to
     As I hope I've shown above, that anonymity benefit would be partly lost.
I don't know offhand whether there would be some remaining incentive to
carry the "unpaid" traffic.  Perhaps the authorities would have to add a
test for that and apply some sort of penalty (e.g., another flag or perhaps
a refusal to distribute the descriptor).
     Frankly, at this point I don't think such a system of "payment" for
relay priority is worth the cost in either development time and effort or
anonymity and prospective user discouragement.  Many of the people in this
world who have the greatest need for the benefits of a system like tor are
also the people least likely to be able to run a relay without fear of
harassment or worse from the states that rule them.
     I started running a relay because I believe it's a good thing for all of
us.  It helps me, IMHO at least, and it helps others at the same time, so
what's to lose?  It's too bad that the Internet wasn't designed with such a
system built into it so that *all* traffic could have been handled in a
fashion similar to what tor does.  But back then, who knew?  We had to crawl
before walking.  So today we have to build on what we have, and maybe we'll
someday get there or somewhere near enough not to matter.
     The tor developers have, I believe, far more urgent matters to deal
with than creating a priority system, and I don't think any priority system
design has yet been shown not to have potential negative effects on the tor
community.  I'm not trying to discourage anyone (except possibly the tor
developers) from trying to dream up such a design, but the development team
should focus first on the things it knows need to be done.  Thus far, it
seems to me that they have been doing an admirable job of that and shouldn't
be diverted from continuing to do that.  They have already found and corrected
quite a few performance problems, and using tor now is usually a much better
experience that it was when I first started using it in 2005.  They have
already identified more such problems to be fixed, so let's see whether the
better performance from those changes will help to reduce the impatience that
drives the requests for a priority system before we worry about adding one to

     If you don't have administrative control over the other relays, then no,

doubt that you'll find much reason to worry except for the fact that they could

     This points up an other issue that is indeed a potential security risk.
Those who manage tor nodes at hosting companies need to have ways to protect
the security of their nodes' log files and, most especially, their nodes'
secret keys.  Nodes at commercial hosting facilities need to keep *all* of
that kind of information in well encrypted file systems with no access to
anyone but the system administrator of the hosted system.

On Mon, 10 Aug 2009 20:48:10 -0400 Ted Smith Ted, please stop doing that.  Only one copy of each message need be
posted to the list.
     Time for you to do some research off the list.  Start by looking up
the definitions of the terms "positive rights" and "negative rights".
They are not interchangeable.  You will see that the former is actually
a misnomer referring to a power, not a right, of someone to violate the
latter of someone else.

Jon, Martin, et al.:  please stop double-posting.  There is only
one or-talk mailing list, even though it has two addresses.
     Thanks.  I would indeed like to switch to Verizon, which gets good
reviews around here for its Internet services.  The hangups for me are
the money involved and the fixed-term contracts.

On Mon, 10 Aug 2009 15:33:10 -0400 Ted Smith      I believe you are.  Martin is correct in that the surest way to kill
freedom on the Internet is to apply socialist economics to it.  It is
probably also the best way to ensure governmental abuses of users of the
Internet (see, for example, communist China or Cuba and, in the most extreme,
North Korea, where the Internet doesn't really exist, for all practical
     What Martin misunderstood is what I object to, which is fraudulent
or otherwise deceptive marketing practices, as exemplified by Comcast.
Time-Warner may also soon join Comcast in this regard, if it hasn't already.

On Mon, 10 Aug 2009 15:09:23 -0400 Praedor Atrebates      That is a good attitude to take when you run a tor relay in a vicinity
where there is an adequate number of competing ISPs with diverse policies,
so that if one gives you trouble, you can quickly jump to another.  But I'm
afraid that where I live it will just get you disconnected from the Internet.

@_subject: Comcast throws down gauntlet to residential accounts 
I'm not spitting nails now, so I guess I've calmed down enough to post
this message.  Friday, while waiting for Comcast to get its act together to
deal with registration problems involving the replacement cablemodem they
brought here (still not resolved), I received the monthly call from their
insecurity division, claiming that my computer was "infected with malicious
software".  Yeah, right.  I informed the person that their monthly harassment
calls about something they obviously knew nothing about were not appreciated.
To date, they have never provided so much as an IP address or a port number
that supposedly had been attacked in any way from my system.  The person then
claimed that my system had been "connecting to botnets", but was unable or
unwilling to support that claim with any evidence and unable or unwilling
to provide even a port number via which the alleged connections had been
made.  (All of the port numbers allowed in my exit policy are reserved port
numbers by IANA or are tor-related ports or are other special purpose ports
limited to particular IP addresses, so they are all legitimate.)  That leaves
only DoS attacks, and it is difficult for me to imagine conducting any
effective DoS attacks via tor because of slowness of doing anything over tor.
I repeatedly offered to close any exit ports that had been affected, but that
they would have to tell me which ones those were.  The person refused.  I was
also told that IP addresses of the supposedly attacked systems or of the
supposedly contacted botnets could not be provided to me either.  (It was not
clear whether the alleged complaints came from the alleged botnet operator(s)
or from the supposed targets of the alleged botnets, but it struck me as
bizarre that a botnet operator would file a complaint with an ISP alleging
interference with the botnet.  I'm quite suspicious that Comcast has made the
whole thing up out of thin air.)
     Next, the conversation took a turn in a different direction.  I was told
that port 443 (my relay's DirPort) was "open facing the Internet", i.e., that
a program was actually listening on that port via the interface that connects
to the cablemodem.  I was told that having *any* ports "open facing the
Internet" was a violation of Comcast's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for
residential accounts.  During this part of the conversation I told the person
to look at   This turned out to be a mistake, probably
because the web pages there have never been updated to replace the client-
server terminology with router terminology, so the person was immediately
convinced that I was running a "server", which the person claimed was a
violation of the AUP.  This means, of course, that one cannot even run sshd
on one's system to allow secure logins from other locations to one's own
computer.  I was told that I would need to upgrade to a Comcast business-class
account if I were going to run a "server", by which they meant having any
program(s) listening on ports accessable from the Internet.
     Please note that Comcast is now running port scanners against their
customers' IP addresses to determine whether anything is listening on any
ports at those addresses.  The person I spoke with did so while talking with
me, but had already seen port scan results before calling me.  I do not know
whether they scan the full range of possible port numbers or only a subset.
The person kept mentioning that 443 was "open", but never mentioned 995,
which was the ORPort and was getting the vast majority of the traffic.
     The net result of that conversation was that I had the choice of shutting
down my relay, MYCROFTsOtherChild, or having my account terminated for a
minimum of 12 months.  I chose the former, at least while I investigate other
options, of which there are only two or three at my location.  A minimal
Comcast business account will cost $60/mo. and require either a 12-month
contract with an installation fee of over $200 or a 24-month contract with
no installation fee.  However, the Comcast business service does not *yet*
have a monthly cap, whereas I've had to throttle my relay quite severely the
past several months due to Comcast's bait-and-switch of last year when the
service sold as being "unlimited" suddenly got a 250 GB/mo. cap imposed last
October.  (Currently, I pay $40/mo. + $3/mo. for cablemodem rental and have
no contract.)
     Verizon residential service is only available at my location if I also
buy their telephone service, the combination of which would cost ~$80/mo. and
also require a 12-month contract.  I have yet to get the details on Verizon
business-class service, but it seems unlikely to be any cheaper.  Verizon's
residential service does not currently have a cap, but I don't know whether
they prohibit listening on ports accessable from the Internet.
     I exist on a shoestring, and even an increase of $17/mo. will come out
of my food intake each month, which already averages about 1.5 meals/day.
If I can manage to revive MYCROFTsOtherChild in the near future, I will do
so, but I don't yet know whether that will be feasible, and it may take a
while to make it happen even it can be done.
     Meanwhile, I see my Comcast addresses of relays on the tor status page,
and I suspect that not all of them are on Comcast business accounts.  If you
are a tor operator on a Comcast residential account, be advised that your
relay's days on that account are probably numbered, so you ought to begin
looking for a different arrangement before they call to threaten you, too.
Now that Comcast has become one of the 800 lb. gorillas among ISPs in the
U.S., it has apparently become an enemy of Internet growth, probably to
preserve its market share without having to invest competitively to keep up
with growth.  They apparently do not run Quality of Service software on
their routers, which is part of the reason they think they need to have a
250 GB/mo. cap on residential accounts, the other part being their presumed
need to inhibit Internet growth.

On Wed, 16 Sep 2009 17:26:31 -0400 Gregory Maxwell      I wondered why my system sent so many RSTs that it sometimes self-limited
them.  I dealt with the problem by setting net.inet.tcp.blackhole=2 to stop
sending RSTs for ports that had no listener.  I later discovered that Comcast
runs port scanners against its own customers' IP addresses, so most likely
Comcast itself was responsible for the output RST overloads my system had
been getting.  I did not know, however, that Comcast was also sending bogus
RSTs, which I think would simply be dropped by most TCP/IP stacks.
