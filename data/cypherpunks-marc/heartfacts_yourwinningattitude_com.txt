Cholesterol is a waxy, fatlike substance (lipid) that your body needs for many important functions, such as producing new cells. If you eat too many high-cholesterol foods and/or too much saturated fat or you have an inherited condition, your cholesterol levels may be too high. This increases your risk for hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, and can lead to life-threatening illnesses, such as coronary artery disease (CAD), heart attack, or stroke. Your body gets cholesterol from two sources: from the foods you eat and from your liver. Although many foods contain cholesterol, your liver actually produces up to 80% of what you need.
