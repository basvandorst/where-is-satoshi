And with your self-issued snake oil certs, make sure you check and
confirm the cert on each device you want to use to access your
webmail server, from your home network, so that if you eventually
tunnel in or otherwise access it 'on the road', you have already
verified your own snake oil cert and a MITM should stand out like
unicorn balls.
Good luck,
