Sports Pouch Beverage Co Inc (SPBV.PK) - BIG PROFITS EXPECTED IN THIS ONE!!!
The stock is expected to explode on Monday and with breaking news of RFP
from the US ARMY momentum is certain for this MONDAY!!
Significant short term trading profits in SPBV are being predicted, great
news expected by the company and big PR campaign on the way in the next few
The Company
Though the product tastes good, Sports Pouch's true advantage lies in its
packaging. Where the consumer is frustrated with opening a pouch beverage
(i.e., Capri sun), Sports Pouch comes with a pull-push spout that reseals
its container.
With pull-push spout pouch technology, consumer use problems with pouch
beverage packaging are eliminated; i.e., difficulty and spillage when
opening, loss of straw resulting in an inability to use the pouch and
inability to reseal the beverage pouch.
Customer surveys taken in Southern California have indicated strong consumer
demand for a new aseptic beverage fortified with vitamins and minerals. With
automated beverage filling equipment and spout technology controlled by
Sports Pouch Beverage Company, Inc., the company is in position to provide
the marketplace both as a manufacturer and a co-packer, a consumer friendly
beverage pouch package at a competitive price with attractive profitability.
With the combination of next generation pouch packaging technology,
co-packing manufacturing, new brand beverage line and established beverage
distribution contacts, Sports Pouch Company, Inc. is positioned to provide
the marketplace with advance beverage pouch packaging and a new brand
beverage at competitive pricing while allowing for attractive profit margins
and strong growth potential.
Competitive Advantage
Though Sports Pouch has a terrific product and important industry contacts
selling into a $1.0 Billion segment of the beverage market, its unique
packaging gives it a truly overwhelming competitive advantage.
The most important competitors, Capri Sun, Minute Maid, Kool Aid, Hi c,
Disney, Libby's, and Tree Top, all place their drinks into a "straw and
pouch" packages. As parents know, this form of packaging ha several
    * Oftentimes, it is difficult to insert the straw into the package
without spillage.
    * Straws for each drink are not always attached to each individual
package. It's frustrating and wasteful when only 6 or 7 straws are attached
on an 8 pack of drinks.
    * If the straw is lost while drinking, you are unable to finish the
    * You can't reseal the package and leave it for several hours to finish
it later.
Using Sports Pouch's patented "pull-push" spout system, these problems
disappear. These spouts look much like the spouts used to reseal bottled
water. Water typically is enclosed in plastic, hard framed bottles and comes
in larger sizes (typically 16 ozs). Sports Pouch's juices come in the
traditional juice sized 6.75 oz package, the correct size for a child's
drink. The resealing technology creates a much more user-friendly package.
The consumer can easily close and re-open the pouch container while also not
requiring an external device, the straw, to drink the beverage.
Sales Projections
The following sales projections are based upon sales of a new brand
beverage. These projections do not include incremental sales, i.e.,
co-packing, military, schools, hospitals, state and local government, etc.
The sales projections are based upon an industry standard of 2.5 cases sold
per day of operation. The 2.5 case sales ratio is calculated using 3% of the
overall aseptic single serve juice category volume sales in the state of
California for the twelve month period ending July 2003.
The following 2004-2006 sales projection are listed by the retailer
    * Cash and Carry: Smart and Final, Jetro
    * Major Chain Retailers: Stater Brothers, Food 4 Less, Albertsons
(southern and northern California), Ralphs, Vons, Safeway, Raley's
    * Major Independents: Super A, Superior Warehouse, Cardineres, KV Mart,
Big A, Sav-U-Foods, Jons, 32nd Street, North Gate, Save Mart, Food 4 Less
(independents), etc.
    * Unified Grocers (formerly known as Certified Grocers): All single
operated supermarkets/food stores with membership in excess of 3,000 stores
    * Distributors: Beverage and general
The sales projections for 2004 are very conservative due to the start-up
nature of the beverage brand. The sales projections for 2005 and 2006 are
based upon the beverage brand having achieved brand awareness. Therefore,
the pattern of volume sales projections increases during the second half of
2005 and during 2006. A retailer's initial order is listed in bold numbers.
These orders qualify for a 10% introduction allowance. Subsequent orders do
not have this price discount.
