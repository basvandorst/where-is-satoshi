In the case of access to e-mail from untrusted computer is convenient and reliable to use one-time password authentication using e-codebook -  mobile Java applet for your phone. A one-time password is generated in response to RAND, generated by the mail server. QR-code can be used. For example see WebMoney enum authorization.
