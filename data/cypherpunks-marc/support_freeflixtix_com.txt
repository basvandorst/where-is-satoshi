FreeFlixTix FAQ
Hello, =20
Thanks for contacting FreeFlixTix.com. We know how important it is to
receive a quick response so we've compiled a list of our frequently
asked questions. Most likely your question will be answered below!
** If this doesn't answer your question, we are ready to help you
   personally, just read to the bottom.** 
Can I really get Free Movie Tickets?
Yes, yes you can. Plain and simple. Plenty of tickets have been earned
What's the catch? How can you afford to give away free tickets?
We facilitate advertising and direct marketing for our partners. Our
deals with them enable us to offer you free movie tickets (admission
certificates). Plus, remember that we only give away free tickets when
5 referrals sign up. If you get less than 5 referrals to sign up -
sorry, no free ticket. Household limitations in effect - maximum of 4
tickets per household. After you have 5 referrals sign up, you will be
required to send in a Redemption Form that confirms the validity of
your referrals. In some cases, we may provide users with an additional
way to earn tickets by completing advertising offers from our
partners. You earn one ticket for every advertising offer you
complete. You may complete as many offers as you like to earn
tickets. When you complete an offer to earn a ticket, you are not
required to send in a redemption form for that ticket. Even if you see
this as an option, you are always able to earn free tickets by getting
five friends to sign up.
How do I earn free movie tickets?
You can earn movie tickets (admission certificates), up to a maximum
of four (4) certificates per household, by registering for a
FreeFlixTix.com account, answering a brief survey about yourself, and
referring five (5) eligible friends who must then join
FreeFlixTix.com. After your five (5) friends have signed up as new
first-time members of FreeFlixTix.com, you will be asked to submit a
Redemption Form (within two (2) weeks of earning the free ticket),
confirming that you and your friends have met our eligibility
requirements - primarily that all of your referrals are real people,
that you didn't just make them up or use other email addresses that
actually belong to you. Provided you meet these requirements, you will
receive a free movie admission certificate (a "Free Ticket") from
Hollywood Movie Magic, good for any movie at thousands of eligible
movie theaters across the country.
To be eligible, you and your friends must be over thirteen (13) years
of age, must be United States residents (with United States postal
mailing addresses), and each person must be new to
FreeFlixTix.com. All referrals must be real people, with real email
and postal mailing addresses. Providing referrals of people with email
or postal mailing addresses that are fictitious, fake, or that belong
to you, will disqualify you from earning Free Tickets. Please see the
FreeFlixTix.com Terms of Service for all applicable eligibility rules
and member requirements.
Additionally, in some cases we may provide a separate way to earn even
more movie tickets by completing an advertising offer from one of our
partners. If you complete any advertising offer, you will not be
required to send in a redemption form for your tickets.
How do I know if and when my friends sign up?
You can log in and check your "Status" page - which lists every email
address you have referred, and which of them have signed up so
far. (And how many free movie tickets you have earned so far). Plus,
every time you earn a free movie ticket, we'll send you an email
telling you so, and telling you when to expect it in the mail. (Please
allow 6-8 weeks for delivery).
How do I use the Free Tickets you send me?
When you earn a free movie ticket, we send you a movie ticket
admission certificate from our partner Hollywood Movie
Magic. Hollywood Movie Magic guarantees acceptance at a theater near
you. You can use the ticket voucher for any movie, any show time, for
as long as the voucher is valid. This includes opening nights and
premieres! The ticket vouchers are valid for one month from the time
when you receive them.
Are the Free Tickets good forever?
The ticket admission certificates are valid for one month from the
time you receive them.
What theaters will accept these tickets?
Hollywood Movie Magic guarantees acceptance of valid movie admission
certificates at a theater near you. Click here to find participating
theaters near you:=20
Who is Hollywood Movie Magic?
Hollywood Movie Magic is the leading provider of movie ticket
admission certificates in the country. They pioneered this market in
1988, and have built relationships with movie chains and theaters in
every single part of the country. Acceptance is guaranteed at a
theater near you. Click here to find participating theaters nearest
How long will it take to get my free tickets
Please allow up to 6-8 weeks delivery of your free movie ticket(s)
from the date we receive your Redemption form, or from the date we
receive confirmation that you have completed an advertising offer. You
can check on your "Status" page when you are logged in to see exactly
the date that any given ticket was earned, and print the Redemption
form you need to send to us. If you have earned a ticket by completing
an advertising offer, it may take from one to several days for us to
receive confirmation from that advertising partner.
Why do I need to send in a Redemption Form when I earn a free ticket?<=
The Redemption Form is required so that we may confirm your identity
and confirm that all of the referrals who signed up and gave you
credit for the ticket are in fact valid referrals, of real people,
with real addresses. Making up fake email or postal addresses, or
referring email addresses that belong to you is strictly prohibited
and will disqualify you from earning free movie tickets.
What is the "Instant Ticket Shortcut"?
In some cases, we provide users with an additional way to earn tickets
by completing advertising offers from our partners. You earn one
ticket for every advertising offer you complete. You may complete as
many offers as you like to earn tickets. When you complete an offer to
earn a ticket, you are not required to send in a redemption form for
that ticket. Even if you see this as an option, you are always able to
earn free tickets by getting five friends to sign up.
What if only 4 of my friends sign up?
Sorry, you need to get 5 referrals to sign up to earn a ticket. The
good news, is that you can earn up to 4 free movie tickets (per
household). So, if you can get 20 friends to sign up, that's 4 free
What if two or more users all refer the same person?
The first person to enter an email address into their referral list
will get credit when that person signs up. To make this easy and
clear, if any user tries to enter an email address of a friend that
has already been referred by someone else, we'll give you feedback
that says "this person has already been invited." In other words, you
can't refer an email address that has already been referred.
How can I cancel my account?
To cancel your account, first log in and go to the "Your Account"
page. Then click the button at the bottom of the page that says
"Cancel Account." If you don't have an account, but want to block
your email address so no one can invite you, click here.
What if my mailing address changes after I earn a free movie ticket?
It is important for you to keep your postal mailing address on the
"Your Account" page current, because that is where we will send your
free movie tickets. We take responsibility for sending your tickets to
the address that is listed in your account at the time you earn your
ticket(s). It is your responsibility to keep that address current, or,
if you change your address *after* earning a ticket, then it is your
responsibility to retrieve the mail from the postal address in your
account at the time of earning the free movie ticket.
When a user cancels their account, what happens to their referrals?
Any referrals who had not signed up yet become available to be
referred by someone new.
If I refer someone who has already signed up, but no one else had
referred them, do I get credit?
No. In order to get credit, you need to refer someone who is not
already signed up.
What if I don't live in the United States?
Sorry, we can only send you tickets to a postal mailing address that
is in the United States. Further, your free movie tickets can only be
used at theaters that are in the United States.

FreeFlixTix FAQ
Hello,  Thanks for contacting FreeFlixTix.com. We know how important it is to
receive a quick response so we've compiled a list of our frequently
asked questions. Most likely your question will be answered below!
** If this doesn't answer your question, we are ready to help you
   personally, just read to the bottom.** 
Can I really get Free Movie Tickets?
Yes, yes you can. Plain and simple. Plenty of tickets have been earned
What if I forget my password?
You can retrieve your password by going to  and entering the email address that you used to register with our service. Your password will then be emailed to that same address.
What's the catch? How can you afford to give away free tickets?
We facilitate advertising and direct marketing for our partners. Our deals with them enable us to offer you free movie tickets (admission certificates). You are required to complete an offer from one of our partners to receive your free ticket(s) that you earned from referrals. When you complete any offer from one of our partners, you earn an additional ticket. We then send you all the free tickets you have earned. Household limitations in effect - maximum of 4 free tickets from referrals per household. You are also able to earn free tickets directly by completing advertising offers from our partners, without any referrals. You earn one ticket for every advertising offer you complete. You may complete as many offers as you like to earn tickets. Even if you see this as an option, you are always able to earn additional free tickets by getting five friends to sign up.
How do I earn free movie tickets?
You can earn movie tickets (admission certificates), up to a maximum
of four (4) certificates per household, by registering for a
FreeFlixTix.com account, answering a brief survey about yourself, and
referring five (5) eligible friends who must then join
FreeFlixTix.com.  After your five (5) friends have signed up as new first-time members of FreeFlixTix.com, you will be asked to complete an offer from one of our partners which will confirm your information for us. Doing so earns you an additional free ticket. When we receive confirmation from that partner that you indeed completed their offer, you will receive your free movie admission certificates ("Free Tickets") from Hollywood Movie Magic, good for any movie at thousands of eligible movie theaters across the country. To be eligible, you and your friends must be over thirteen (13) years
of age, must be United States residents (with United States postal
mailing addresses), and each person must be new to
FreeFlixTix.com. All referrals must be real people, with real email
and postal mailing addresses. Providing referrals of people with email
or postal mailing addresses that are fictitious, fake, or that belong
to you, will disqualify you from earning Free Tickets. Please see the
FreeFlixTix.com Terms of Service for all applicable eligibility rules
and member requirements.
The second way you can earn movie tickets is by completing an advertising offer from one of our partners without having gotten any referrals to sign up. This is available only to registered FreeFlixTix members who are over eighteen (18) years of age. There is no limit to how many movie tickets you can earn in this manner. You earn one movie ticket for each advertising offer that you complete. What happened to the Redemption Form?
In response to the overwhelming feedback from our members, we changed the way we verify your information.  Instead of the hassle of printing and mailing us the Redemption form along with a copy of your I.D., now, with the help of our partners, we're able to verify your information (identity and age) online through our partners' secure servers.   You are asked to complete an offer from one of our partners, and many of them are free or at minimal cost.  Why are my friends getting email from me about this?
When you register for FreeFlixTix, our Terms of Service lets you know that your friends (referrals) will receive reminders from FreeFlixTix on your behalf.   We know how important it is for you to earn your free tickets, so we want to remind your friends to sign up so that you'll get credit, and also so that they may earn their own free tickets.  How do I know if and when my friends sign up?
You can log in and check your "Status" page - which lists every email
address you have referred, and which of them have signed up so
far. (And how many free movie tickets you have earned so far). Plus,
every time you earn a free movie ticket, we'll send you an email
telling you so, and telling you when to expect it in the mail. (Please
allow 12-14 weeks for delivery).
How do I use the Free Tickets you send me?
When you earn a free movie ticket, we send you a movie ticket
admission certificate from our partner Hollywood Movie
Magic. Hollywood Movie Magic guarantees acceptance at a theater near
you. You can use the ticket voucher for any movie, any show time, for
as long as the voucher is valid. This includes opening nights and
premieres! The ticket vouchers are valid for one month from the time
when you receive them.
Are the Free Tickets good forever?
The ticket admission certificates are valid for one month from the
time you receive them.

you: How long will it take to get my free tickets
Please allow up to 12-14 weeks delivery of your free movie ticket(s) from the date we receive confirmation that you have completed an advertising offer. You can check on your "Status" page when you are logged in to see exactly the date that any given ticket was earned, and when to expect confirmation and receive the ticket(s). It may take from one to several days for us to receive confirmation from our advertising partners. What is the "Instant Ticket Shortcut"?
In some cases, we provide users with an additional way to earn tickets
by completing advertising offers from our partners. You earn one
ticket for every advertising offer you complete. You may complete as
many offers as you like to earn tickets. When you complete an offer to
earn a ticket, you are not required to send in a redemption form for
that ticket. Even if you see this as an option, you are always able to
earn free tickets by getting five friends to sign up.
What if only 4 of my friends sign up?
Sorry, you need to get 5 referrals to sign up to earn a ticket. The
good news, is that you can earn up to 4 free movie tickets (per
household). So, if you can get 20 friends to sign up, that's 4 free
What if two or more users all refer the same person?
The first person to enter an email address into their referral list
will get credit when that person signs up. To make this easy and
clear, if any user tries to enter an email address of a friend that
has already been referred by someone else, we'll give you feedback
that says "this person has already been invited." In other words, you
can't refer an email address that has already been referred.
How can I cancel my account?
To cancel your account, first log in and go to the "Your Account"
page. Then click the button at the bottom of the page that says
"Cancel Account." If you don't have an account, but want to block
your email address so no one can invite you, click here.
What if my mailing address changes after I earn a free movie ticket?
It is important for you to keep your postal mailing address on the
"Your Account" page current, because that is where we will send your
free movie tickets. We take responsibility for sending your tickets to
the address that is listed in your account at the time you earn your
ticket(s). It is your responsibility to keep that address current, or,
if you change your address *after* earning a ticket, then it is your
responsibility to retrieve the mail from the postal address in your
account at the time of earning the free movie ticket.
If I refer someone who has already signed up, but no one else had
referred them, do I get credit?
No. In order to get credit, you need to refer someone who is not
already signed up.
What if my referrals don't sign up?
We will be sending them at least one and perhaps several reminders on your behalf, to encourage them to sign up, so that they can start earning their own free movie tickets, and so that you will get credit towards your free movie tickets.
What if I don't live in the United States?
Sorry, we can only send you tickets to a postal mailing address that
is in the United States. Further, your free movie tickets can only be
used at theaters that are in the United States.

FreeFlixTix FAQ
Hello,  Thanks for contacting FreeFlixTix.com. We know how important it is to
receive a quick response so we've compiled a list of our frequently
asked questions. Most likely your question will be answered below!
** If this doesn't answer your question, we are ready to help you
   personally, just read to the bottom.** 
Can I really get Free Movie Tickets?
Yes, yes you can. Plain and simple. Plenty of tickets have been earned
What if I forget my password?
You can retrieve your password by going to  and entering the email address that you used to register with our service. Your password will then be emailed to that same address.
What's the catch? How can you afford to give away free tickets?
We facilitate advertising and direct marketing for our partners. Our deals with them enable us to offer you free movie tickets (admission certificates). You are required to complete an offer from one of our partners to receive your free ticket(s) that you earned from referrals. When you complete any offer from one of our partners, you earn an additional ticket. We then send you all the free tickets you have earned. Household limitations in effect - maximum of 4 free tickets from referrals per household. You are also able to earn free tickets directly by completing advertising offers from our partners, without any referrals. You earn one ticket for every advertising offer you complete. You may complete as many offers as you like to earn tickets. Even if you see this as an option, you are always able to earn additional free tickets by getting five friends to sign up.
How do I earn free movie tickets?
You can earn movie tickets (admission certificates), up to a maximum
of four (4) certificates per household, by registering for a
FreeFlixTix.com account, answering a brief survey about yourself, and
referring five (5) eligible friends who must then join
FreeFlixTix.com.  After your five (5) friends have signed up as new first-time members of FreeFlixTix.com, you will be asked to complete an offer from one of our partners which will confirm your information for us. Doing so earns you an additional free ticket. When we receive confirmation from that partner that you indeed completed their offer, you will receive your free movie admission certificates ("Free Tickets") from Hollywood Movie Magic, good for any movie at thousands of eligible movie theaters across the country. To be eligible, you and your friends must be over thirteen (13) years
of age, must be United States residents (with United States postal
mailing addresses), and each person must be new to
FreeFlixTix.com. All referrals must be real people, with real email
and postal mailing addresses. Providing referrals of people with email
or postal mailing addresses that are fictitious, fake, or that belong
to you, will disqualify you from earning Free Tickets. Please see the
FreeFlixTix.com Terms of Service for all applicable eligibility rules
and member requirements.
The second way you can earn movie tickets is by completing an advertising offer from one of our partners without having gotten any referrals to sign up. This is available only to registered FreeFlixTix members who are over eighteen (18) years of age. There is no limit to how many movie tickets you can earn in this manner. You earn one movie ticket for each advertising offer that you complete. What happened to the Redemption Form?
In response to the overwhelming feedback from our members, we changed the way we verify your information.  Instead of the hassle of printing and mailing us the Redemption form along with a copy of your I.D., now, with the help of our partners, we're able to verify your information (identity and age) online through our partners' secure servers.   You are asked to complete an offer from one of our partners, and many of them are free or at minimal cost.  Why are my friends getting email from me about this?
When you register for FreeFlixTix, our Terms of Service lets you know that your friends (referrals) will receive reminders from FreeFlixTix on your behalf.   We know how important it is for you to earn your free tickets, so we want to remind your friends to sign up so that you'll get credit, and also so that they may earn their own free tickets.  How do I know if and when my friends sign up?
You can log in and check your "Status" page - which lists every email
address you have referred, and which of them have signed up so
far. (And how many free movie tickets you have earned so far). Plus,
every time you earn a free movie ticket, we'll send you an email
telling you so, and telling you when to expect it in the mail. (Please
allow 12-14 weeks for delivery).
How do I use the Free Tickets you send me?
When you earn a free movie ticket, we send you a movie ticket
admission certificate from our partner Hollywood Movie
Magic. Hollywood Movie Magic guarantees acceptance at a theater near
you. You can use the ticket voucher for any movie, any show time, for
as long as the voucher is valid. This includes opening nights and
premieres! The ticket vouchers are valid for one month from the time
when you receive them.
Are the Free Tickets good forever?
The ticket admission certificates are valid for one month from the
time you receive them.
