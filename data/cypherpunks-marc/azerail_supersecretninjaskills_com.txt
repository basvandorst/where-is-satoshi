True, tho they've never made any guarentee of annomity.  Still, I am
just wary of the "slippery slope" inherent to this.
It's just that child pornography is starting to be used as a blanket
crime which is used to justify increased goverment and police
survelllience, much like terrorism.  Of course, I don't want anyone
who is guilty of a crime against children to get away with it, but I
also don't want my natural feelings regarding the well-being of
children to be used to monitor otherwise legal activies.  Citizens
possessing the means to communicate or gather information privately
is, of course, of great interest to most authories, IMO.
True, it's just how they tried that concerns me.  At any rate, this
should be a leason to everyone, don't trust things outside of your
total control.

And what's next?  Kazaa? IRC? (lord knows IRC can be used to
facilitate crime) A "bad" crime is simply a way to introduce the idea
to the general populance with a crime that elicts support, and then
gradually, it's used to encompass other crimes.  Personally, I don't
like the idea of a anon proxy service rolling over and not informing
users, regardless of the crime "some" users may have been committing.
