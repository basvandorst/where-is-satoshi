GSM and GPRS are vulnerable to MitM due to lack of two factor authentication etc. WCDMA (3G) and LTE (4G) should be safe as they have much better security. Not sure about 3GPP2 (CDMA) or WiMAX systems, perhaps early version of CDMA has similar problems as GSM. But saying that '4G' is vulnerable is a pretty broad statement as it consists of at least LTE and WiMAX, and some US operators also refer to their WCDMA HSPA as 4G. There is also a difference between 'the standard has security flaws' and 'the operator has deployed an insecure network' as operators might run their network with security features turned off.
Anyway, the paranoid should turn of GSM and run WCDMA instead.

xit node, or an open access point, or anything else. In sensible countries =

It could also be the case that they think the person running the Tor exit n=

Hopefully he will get it all back but it will most liklely cost both time a=

runs an operating system taken away. Phones. Tablet. Laptop. Servers. All p=

Fully agree.

Lets assume that some child pr0n dealer used this Tor exit node, is it not reasonable if the police wants to see if there are logs that make it possible to catch the sleazebag? Should LE ignore crime if it originates from a network which operates a Tor exit node? I am all for being anonymous on the net but I seriously believe that we still need to enforce the law when it comes to serious felonies like child pr0n, organized crime etc, we can't give them a free pass just by using Tor. I dont think it should be illegal to operate a Tor exit node but what just happened could be a consequence of doing it.
Of course they might not know abot Tor and believes that it is Mr Williams that is the bad guy.

I agree. I was about to set up a tor node a few years ago but never got around to it. I send cash to orgs working for human rights in countries with oppressive regimes. I am all for providing anonymized access to help free speech. Perhaps its better with anon access to specific applications like twitter, fb etc and not general internet access. I suspect that the 'free speech' part of the total tor traffic volume is pretty small(?).
