What do you mean you see the guys you're talking to? You mean skype can do video streaming? Or you just see their names in your buddy list?
Open volume control and check the microphone levels. Can you use the microphone for anything else? Like audacity? I somehow doubt it's F7, because I was able to use my microphone without a problem. Haven't tried skype under F7 though.
