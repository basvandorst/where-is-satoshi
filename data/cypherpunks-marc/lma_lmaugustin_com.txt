I think that it would be a big mistake to do anything that might be viewed
as even the slightest bit disruptive in this venue.  Further, I think you're
jumping to conclusions to assume that the DMCA is relevant to these
Dennis Allison and John Wharton, both of whom I have known for years, are
sympathetic to free software and sympathetic to the problems with the DMCA.
Dennis regularly brings in Bruce, Eric, and Richard as speakers.  I've
spoken at this seminar on 2 or 3 occasions.  Bruce was just there a few
weeks ago talking about the RAND vs. RF patent policy issues.
Cops have a tough job.  They deserve our thanks for doing a tough job.  I
have a number of close friends who are cops.  I think they deserve more
benefit of doubt than "Target the _speakers_ and _philosophy_".  It doesn't
sound like these are people that write the laws or make policy.  Maybe they
spend their time fighting real computer crime like identity theft and
crackers.  They deserve our support in that job.
Has anyone talked to Dennis?  Before jumping to any conclusions, or
organizing any kind of protest or demonstration, talk to Dennis.
