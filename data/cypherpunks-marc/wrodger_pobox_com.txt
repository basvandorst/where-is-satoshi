If it's your copyright, it's still yours. The law recognizes that.
The journalist received the information from a source gratis. That's different from paying for stolen goods, hiring someone to eavesdrop, or breaking the law yourself. The First Amendment covers a lot, in this case.
There's language governing that in the statute. Trafficking in tools specifically designed to break a given form of copy protection is one thing. The continued availability of legal tools for cryptanalysis and legitimate password cracking is another. As bad as the DMCA is, it's not _that_ bad.

That, I think, is an unintended consequence of the law, but I bet there's a lawyer somewhere who'd take a crack at it. More important is the origin of the info. itself: were it peacetime you'd have a pretty clear case of receiving stolen property. Add to that certain trade-secret laws in various of the 50 United States, and you could do a long time in the slammer over Will Rodger
