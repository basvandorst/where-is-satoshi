Hi all,
Some very interesting points so far. To avoid making this email too
long, I'm going to reply without quoting - I hope this doesn't
inconvenience anyone.
Regarding the memorability issue, all I can say is that end-to-end
encryption really does require sharing 100+ bit keys - it's essential!
You may be able to memorise your email address at the moment, but
that's only half the story, since you can't memorise your public key!
I can't solve every problem with PGP, but I still think this proposal
solves a fair few of them. In some cases it improves on PGP, and in
the other case it's at least no worse: you can still use online
institutional directories etc if you want.
Don't forget all the advantages this scheme could bring! Simplicity
and transparency for the end user is really important! They're more
likely to understand the significance of a public key if it forms part
of the address (despite not understanding why it has to be this way).
Perhaps it doesn't help Derek's mum - nor my mum, for that matter -
but there are plenty of people for whom PGP is to complex whereas this
scheme would be manageable. If you wish, you can send some emails
encrypted and others unencrypted, just like you can with PGP - in this
case, you'd just need two addresses (which is surely no worse than
PGP, where you have an address and a key).
Regarding telephone conversations: if it's with a mobile phone,
perhaps a text message would work; if it's a landline, you probably
have internet access, so an initial unencrypted email would work if
you're not worried about man-in-the-middle attacks. (If you are
worried about such attacks, then a bit of effort might be required,
beyond just rattling off a short email address over the phone.)
By the way, I'm suggesting printable characters to encode the key, not
arbitrary bytes. An alphanumeric character stores nearly 6 bits (or 5
if it isn't case-sensitive), so 256-bit keys would require around 50
characters. Email standards allow 64 characters for the local part of
the address, so there's room for error-correction too.
Regarding the point about forged email addresses: for cryptography to
work, you need to identify people using their keys, not their
addresses. With PGP, you could send an email to my mum, using my email
address but the wrong signature; if my mum is just relying on the
email address, then that defeats the purpose of PGP. Of course, most
PGP systems compare the key with that stored in the address book; a
similar system can be used for my proposal, but with the advantage
that forged emails don't give rise to the situation where the address
is known but the key is unknown, which might lead a naive user to
assume something's broken with the crypto software.
Regarding webmail... I still haven't solved that one. Maybe there's an
inherent contradiction in trying to include webmail in an end-to-end
encryption system.
I like the idea of using the "address+key technique,
although it does contradict the idea of "identify people using the
key, not the address". Also, in my original proposal, I suggested
using the private key (instead of a password) to login to the email
server. I reckon Gmail is unlikely to allow that in the near future :)
Best wishes,

I think the metadata issue is really interesting, and I'm interested
in what various schemes (P2P, Dark mail alliance, etc) are doing about
it. But I think you and I are talking about different problems: your
main concern (which is a valid one!) is that encrypted emails still
expose metadata, whereas my concern is the fact that hardly anybody is
currently able to use email encryption at all! I think both concerns
are fair, and both are worth trying to solve.

I haven't invented any new cryptography - functionally, it's similar
to what already exists.
But I think the reason that encryption still isn't widely used (after
more than 2 decades!) is the usability. Even if encryption/decryption
are automated, you still need to understand concepts like public keys
and digital signatures in case something goes wrong.
By combining the address and the public key, I think everything makes
much more sense to the end user: when they send emails to some
address, they know it can't be intercepted, and when they receive an
email from some address, they know that it definitely came from there.
The encryption/decryption can be handled automatically by something
like Enigmail, but now the user can easily understand the problem if
something goes wrong: errors will say things like "this email didn't
really come from that address", rather than "this digital signature
doesn't match the key".

Well, each email is digitally signed using the sender's key (as well
as being encrypted using the recipient's key) so it's impossible to
spoof the address.
As for trust, I think the whole point of cryptography is that you
should trust the digital signature rather than just checking the
sender's address. With my scheme, the address and the public key are
the same thing, so if an email is forged then the software can say
"This email isn't really from that address" rather than "Error!
Invalid key".
I haven't changed anything in terms of the cryptography - I'm just
trying to make things more usable.

I think maybe I didn't make the bit about private keys very clear:
we're talking about proper randomly-generated private keys, just in
PGP. I was just suggesting that since you have to walk around with a
private key file, at least it gives you an excuse to get rid of
passwords, and just authenticate with the server using the private

Hash: SHA117/09/2014Hello.I think I might have a way to make email =
encryption easily accessible to the general public, and would be very grate=
ful if you could share any comments you might have.I think the exis=
ting algorithms (RSA, Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve equivalents) are perfe=
ctly sound, as are the software programs (GPG and email client plug-ins), b=
ut the user is still required to understand concepts like public/private ke=
ys and digital signatures. I think these conceptual difficulties are what a=
re holding back a more widespread adoption of email encryption, and this is=
 what I wish to solve. (See "Why Johnny Can't Encrypt".)<=
br>I propose that we use the local part of the email address to store the p=
ublic key, so instead of HenryAugustusChamberlain my email address would be (64 r=
andom letters) (This is by no m=
eans a new principle - Bitcoin does something similar, although it uses a h=
ash of the public key rather than the key itself.) RSA keys are too long, b=
ut elliptic curve keys would work fine.I think combining addresses =
and keys actually makes intuitive sense. When you send an email to a partic=
ular address, you expect it to be read by that person and no-one else. Like=
wise, when you receive an email from some particular address, you expect to=
 have originated from that address and nowhere else. This is precisely what=
 public-key encryption guarantees, by means of encryption in the former cas=
e and digital signatures in the latter case. Using keys as addresses would =
remove the need for the user to understand public keys, encryption and digi=
tal signatures: everything would "just work" automatically - with=
out compromising security in any way.Having long (and unmemorable) =
email addresses would certainly create some problems, although perhaps fewe=
r than one might initially imagine. "Mailto" links on web pages w=
ould continue to work as they always have done, as would institutions' =
email directories and private individuals' address books. Exchanging em=
ail addresses in person might be problematic, but QR codes might be of use =
here: they can be displayed on a smartphone screen or printed on business c=
ards. Passing email addresses over the telephone remains a problem (althoug=
h in the case of mobile phones, a text message could be used instead).<=
br>Somebody not using encrypted emails could still click on your "mail=
to" link and send you an email, although it will be unencrypted (and t=
hey would probably ask you why your email address is such a strange one!). =
Perhaps some people might choose to add a footer to unencrypted emails - li=
ke Hotmail used to do - explaining that they use encryption, and encouragin=
g others to do likewise.The issue of private keys still remains, bu=
t perhaps they could take the place of passwords: when configuring a deskto=
p (or mobile) email client, one would provide a private key file (or a QR c=
ode) instead of a password. SSH already allows users to login using public =
key certificates rather than passwords. Configuring a phone (or new PC) is =
only ever done once, so hopefully this small hurdle would not impose an und=
ue burden on the user. Webmail would be tricky to use, since a user could h=
ardly be expected to memorise a 64 character password, but one might questi=
on whether webmail can have any place at all in an end-to-end encryption sy=
stem.In summary, I believe my proposal would allow encrypted emails=
 to very closely resemble the existing unencrypted system that users are ac=
customed to. As far as the user is concerned, encrypted emails work just li=
ke normal emails, except that the email addresses are longer, and their pas=
sword is replaced with a QR code that needs to be printed off and stored so=
mewhere safe. In return for this, their messages are guaranteed to be encry=
pted end-to-end and digitally signed, or from the user's point of view,=
 emails would "just work" the way they should: "To Mr X"=
; means that only Mr X can receive it, and "From Mr Y" means that=
 only Mr Y could have sent it.-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version:=
