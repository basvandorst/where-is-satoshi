It doesn't matter what contract an auto maker makes with someone who purchases the car, if the brakes fail and the car hits ME, I can sue the auto maker due to the defective brakes.  If they design the car in a way that a 3rd party can easily tamper with the brakes, and then the car hits me, I can also sue the auto maker.  They are legally required to take due care in how they design the car to ensure that innocent bystanders aren't injured or killed by a design defect.  IMHO, there's no difference in the core responsibility that software makers should be held to, to ensure that their software isn't easily compromised and used to attack and injure 3rd parties.  The EULA is a red herring, as it only applies to the purchaser (who agrees to the EULA when they purchase the computer or software), not to 3rd parties who are injured.
If the software doesn't work as designed and the purchaser is unhappy, that's between them and the company they bought the software from.  But when it injures a 3rd party, that's a whole different ball game.  I truly don't understand why ISP's (who bear the brunt of the burden of the fall-out from the compromised software, as they fight spam and have to provide customer support to users who complain that the "internet is slow" etc.) haven't said ENOUGH.

ISPs are not the source.  The source is Microsoft.  The source is their buggy OS that is easily compromised to enable the computers to be taken over as part of the botnet.
Why isn't ANYONE going after Microsoft over this?  If Microsoft were held accountable for the spam and DDOSs that spew from their crappy software, they would find a way to stop the problem.  I've raised this issue before, IMHO Windows OSs are "attractive nuisances" and that legal argument can be used to hold Microsoft responsible for not putting an adequate "fence" around their "attractive nuisance".
If all the big ISPs banded together to file suit against Microsoft, they could share the cost (and pain) of the lawsuit.  Instead, you each individually keep trying to implement in-house solutions to filter/block spam and DDOSs.  How's that working for ya?

In the US, by accident (surely not by design) we are lucky that our network of networks does not have the convenient 4 chokepoints that the Egyptian network had, making it easy for the government to shut off the entier internet by putting pressure on just 4 companies.
Where we *really* need to be fighting this battle is in the laws and policies that are producing a duopoly in much of the US where consumers have 2 choices, the ILEC for DSL or their local cableco for Cable Internet.  As theses companies push smaller competing ISPs out of business, and as they consolidate (e.g. Cablecos buying each other up, resulting in fewer and fewer cablecos over time), we head down the direction of Egypt, where pressure on just a few companies CAN shut down the entire internet.  Otherwise we end up with a few companies that will play Visa and PayPal and roll over and play dead when a government official says "Wikileaks is bad" - and equally easily will shut down their entire networks for "national security".
If you *really* believe that the TSA is effective, you would be in favor of an Internet Kill Switch.  If you understand that this is really security theater, and despite all the inconvenience we aren't really any safer, then you should equally be very concerned that someone ever has the power to order that the internet be "shut down" for our safety.

I personally know Lynn Brown, OES (Office of Emergency Services) Coordinator for the City of Mountain View, CA[1]. I asked Lynn about the status of the maps the MV EOC (Emergency Operations Center) uses.  Here is the reply:
If you believe that this is not the norm for EOCs across the country, I suggest you personally ask the OES Coordinator for whatever city you think is putting everything in the computer and no longer keeping any paper copies.  You may be surprised to learn how well they have indeed thought this thru, and that they do maintain paper maps in the EOC, just as Mountain View does.
[1]  Given that Google has wired MV with free public WiFi, if there were ever a city that would be in a good position to use and rely on Google's cloud services for data storage, Mountain View would be it.

This is what disaster simulations are for, to suss out these problems before a disaster and put in systems to avoid the mess.
In the real world, while a city might keep the digital documents "in the cloud" they would also (always) have paper copies, because in a big emergency their computers (local mail/file servers or internet access to the cloud) are likely to be unavailable, power or internet access is likely to be disrupted.  In a true emergency such as Loma Prieta, they are going to reach for the paper maps that were printed and saved for just this eventuality, and part of the emergency preparedness is to have a regular process to print and save updated maps (every year or 6 months or month or whenever there's a major change - each department will undoubtedly have their own metrics depending on how critical their maps are).  If you haven't participated in your city/county CERT training and disaster simulation exercises, I highly suggest you get involved.  CERT is a great program and will really help open your eyes to many types of emergency planning you probably haven't thought about.  Plus, the more involved you are with CERT the more you are "known" to your local disaster management teams, and the better access you will have to them in the event of a major disaster.

I've run into this problem with setting up accounts on aps on my smartphone.  A secure password that is relatively easy to type on a regular keyboard becomes a PITA to type on a smartphone.  There are a number of sites I simply don't use on my phone because the hassle of setting up each site's ap is greater than the benefit I get from accessing it via the phone.
