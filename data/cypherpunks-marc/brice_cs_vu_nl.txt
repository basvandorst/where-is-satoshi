What   is it?OEM stands for "Original Equipment Manufacturer." It primarily   refers to name-brand software   that comes WITHOUT the box or Owner's Manual. Why do you care? You can purchase OEM (even Microsoft and Adobe) and other name-brand software, for unbelievably low prices -- often much lower than from the original manufacturer. Check out OEM today at following the linkremove
