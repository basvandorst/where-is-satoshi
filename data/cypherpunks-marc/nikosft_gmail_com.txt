A naive comment.
In his first email Zooko states:
"S4 offers =93*verifiable* end-to-end security=94 because all of the source
code that makes up the Simple Secure Storage Service is published for
everyone to see"
A suspicious user may wonder, how can he be sure that the service
indeed uses the provided source code. IMHO, end-to-end security can be
really verifiable--from the user perspective--if it can be attested by
examining only the source code of the applications running on the user
