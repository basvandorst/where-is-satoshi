There's an older book "Making Use of Ruby" by Suresh Mahadevan (Wiley
Publishing, 2002).  It takes a very introductory approach to Ruby, and
is an introductory book on programming in general.  You may find it to
be too introductory, but I think it does a good job presenting Ruby
concepts using a slow, step-by-step approach, with lots of small
examples - an easy read for an experienced programmer such as yourself.
 Several students in a programming languages class I teach read the
book and found it useful.  One problem is that it's a bid dated, covers
Ruby 1.6.  Good luck!
