There are a lot of postings like this one.  The poetry is very excellent perhaps?  Dylan Thomas meets Peter Wayner at Starbucks in Palo Alto.

Yes, thanks.  I completely neglected to enumerate the possibility
that the reporter got it all wrong, the most probable explanation for the conundri of Baker's purported utterings.
Reporters are, after all, lamers.   :)

The test of intelligence is the ability to reconcile contradictory stimulus and make the better decision, dickhead muthafuckah.
Like I said, there's good and bad on both sides of the line.  Most cops will behave a fuck of a lot more responsibly than most people like you.
It doesn't mean I suck up to cops, it just means I deal with them more intelligently than you.

not if you ever lived in new york, ate lunch innumerable times in the courtyard below the towers, watched the pink and blue sunrise reflect off them as you took a dawn ferry with your lover, watched the city glisten from a quarter-mile up in the sky, felt your stomach flutter in vertigo at the sheer size of the towers against the clouds standing at the base looking up ...
We are in tears looking at the cracked city.
You were never there, or you have no soul.

It's nice that there's a forum available to you where you are free to assert and assume whatever you wish, without the inconvenience of any They were allowed to speak
How do you know what information was discussed?
You are free to believe whatever you wish.  But that's not a
standard of proof that means anything.
Personal belief, supposition, unsubstantiated assertion.  I'm glad we're not talking about anything like you'd
see in a star chamber or brutal prison regime.  Glad
you exhibit a pristine standard of evidence in
contrast to those you revile.  Hypocrite.

How about we play "let's hypothesize the conditions that make our argument true."  That saves having to ground your reasoning in reality.
The Washington Post article says "and limited access to their lawyers"....
and "The Justice Department has also refused to reveal the names of the lawyers representing them."
At least they have lawyers, don't you get the point?
The dead had no lawyers to argue for thier lives.
"That process is supervised by a court."
The dead had no judge supervising their execution.
Then you don't know what you're arguing, do you?
Pick your battles.
Wiretapping expansion, big problem, Lack of luxury accomodations for material witnesses
who are at the least crucial information resources and
may be co-conspirators, little problem.

You all, including Mr. May, missed the subtlety of the point that due process has NOT been suspended in the case of these detainees.
They HAVE representation, and I don't THINK the Bill
of Rights says anywhere that you get to see Mommy
if you're arrested, but that you can obtain
representation, you are not required to incriminate
yourself, and so forth.  In theory.
I just can't bring myself to whine about the detained under the circumstances, when I know
of second-graders who are buried under a literal megaton of rubble.
Should "civil liberties be suspended?"  No.  Should suspects be treated like kindergardners?
Fuck no.

         The ghost of Due Process hovers above the funeral pyre where her entire sisterhood burned, drifting between the wafting billows of rancid smoke, and I ask myself: What is to be done?

wl p An Metet raged on:
If this is an example of your communication style it's no wonder you've had the shit beat out of you by the cops and I wish them well doing it.  I have been arrested, jailed, lunched with ex State Attorneys, chatted with FBI, bickered with the NSA, watched homicide detectives get a statement from the person who butchered and dismembered my best friend, have an ex-cop relative, had a guy beat almost to death with baseball bats on my front step while the 'pigs' responded code 3 to save his fucking life, lived in warzone ghettos.  Don't tell me about not having any experience with cops.
Your incoherent ranting fails to account for there being good and bad on both sides of the blue line, and frankly I'll take a confrontation with a "pig" over a confrontation with a maniac like you any day.  At least they sort of screen out as many psychopaths as possible.

Reading the article it looks more like the kind of news that's playing a lot these days: the story of 'something is not yet being done', nobody is claiming to be doing it, but it could be done and the majority of people would support it.  A kind of "no news is news" story.
At the same time, if Baker, attorney with Steptoe (god what a perfect name!), were aware of this and leaked it to the press based on work he is doing with the FBI, wouldn't he be subject to imprisonment or at least civil and professional penalties for violation of attorney-client confidentiality?  Unless the FBI wants it leaked.  And why?  To gauge reaction perhaps.  To tell the frogs the heat's going to be turned up a notch?
But it also could be Baker trying to keep warm in the sunshine of publicity by having something to say.  At the same time spouting this information would be a most egregious violation of at least SOMEthing.
"Curiouser and curiouser," said Alice!
