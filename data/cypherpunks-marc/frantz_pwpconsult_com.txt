Note that if the user can modify the wallet, a "fat, dumb, and happy"

Attack 1:
(1) Withdraw $0.01 from the bank.
(2) Change a random bit in the encrypted wallet.  (Picking the bit to
change will be easier if the storage format in known.)
(3) Fire up the application as see how much money you have.
Attack 2:
(1) Withdraw many $$$ from the bank.
(2) Copy the wallet.
(3) Deposit the $$$ back in the bank.
(4) Restore the wallet using the copy.
While there are certainly ways to notice modifications to the wallet, and
prevent the replay attack, they result in considerable additional

There is a common example of this corner case where the memory is paged.
The page containing the key is swapped out, then it is read back in and the
key is overwritten, and then the page is deallocated.  Many OSs will not
zero the disk copy of the key.
Crypto coders have discussed many kludges to ensure that keys are not
swapped out, but they are all quite system specific.  Since the problem we
were trying to solve is different environments producing different results,
I don't feel we are any closer to safe, portable code.

Java is certainly an improvement for buffer overruns.  (The last estimate I

is still semi-intrepreted, so it is probably too slow for some
applications.  However Java is being used for server-side scripting with

@_subject: Responding to orders which include a secrecy requirement 
The Java Anonymous Proxy (JAP) service, your local library, and you, among
others need to develop a response should you be served with an order (court
or otherwise) to produce information which includes the requirement that
you keep the order secret.
There are a large number of responses one could use.  Some of them might be:
* Cooperate.
* Take the service down.
* Publicly refuse to cooperate.
* Publicly announce that you are being monitored.
* Stop saying that the service is not monitored.
* Appear to cooperate, but provide false information.
* etc.
Please keep in mind when reading the following analysis that I am not a lawyer.
Cooperation seems to be the safest from a short term legal standpoint.
However, to the extent it encourages the police state, it is dangerous in
the long term.
Taking the service down is an obvious response.  It is a difficult response
for your public library to implement.  In addition, a strict enough secrecy
order could require you to keep the service up.
Publicly refusing to cooperate is the most honorable response, and will
probably end you up in jail for an indefinite term on contempt charges.
This is the path of civil disobedience, followed by a number of heros in
past encounters with totalitarianism.
Publicly announcing that you are being monitored will probably end up with
the same contempt charges as a public refusal to cooperate, coupled with
the possibility of the dishonorable act of breaking your word (depending on
your terms of service).
Stopping your notification that the service is not monitored can be
forbidden by a strict enough secrecy order.  It may be the least legally
risky of the options.  The fact that you will stop notification should be
included in your terms of service.
Providing false information is an interesting option, but I think you are
legal toast if you are caught doing it.  One can get a lot of amusement
from considering who to implicate in place of the real anonymous user.

The images of these pieces of paper are also posted on a web page, so the

being counted.  These votes are passed through a number of mixes, which may
be run by different organizations before they are completely decrypted and
counted.  (The mixes prevent a decrypted ballot from being associated with
an input, encrypted ballot.)  The encryption of the ballots is performed by
over-printing the plain-text ballots, so the voter can verify the ballot's
correctness before it is encrypted.  The mixes are verified by random
inspection.  This system seems to meet the above requirements.
Now, I can think of some ways to cheat with this system, but they are all a
lot more likely to be found than cheats with the current systems.
The big knock on all-electronic voting machines is that they are a step
backwards in independent verification and audit from paper ballots, or even
punch cards.  (Yes, you can argue about hanging chad, pregnant chad,
dimpled chad etc., but at least you have something tangible that represents
each ballot.)
The saving grace of the old mechanical voting machines is that they are
mechanical, and hard to modify for cheating.  Most anyone on this list can
imagine the program in an electronic voting machine being different from
the one that was audited and approved.  That's hard to do with a mechanical
system.  We have seen failures where the mechanical systems lost all the
votes made on them however, a failure that seems possible with the
electronic systems as well.
IMHO, the problem with Chaum's systems is that it is complex.  I think that
saving a printed paper ballot, along with the electronic totals, gives much
the same level of security and assurance, with a system that the average
voter can understand.

On 9/21/13 at 5:07 PM, code (Patrick I think that this comment is a serious misinterpretation of the discussion on the TLS list.
The RFC under discussion is a Best Current Practices (BCP) RFC. Some people, including me, think that changes to the protocol or current implementations of the protocol are out of scope for a BCP document.
There are several implementations of TLS which will only do 1024 bit Diffie-Hellman ephemeral (DHE)[1]. The question as I see it is: Are we better off recommending forward security with 1024 bit DHE, with the possibility that large organizations can brute force it; or using the technique of having the client encrypt the keying material with the server's RSA key with the probability that the same large organizations have acquired the server's secret key.
Now there are good arguments on both sides.
The nearly complete database of who talks to who allows "interesting" communications [2] to be singled out for attacks on the 1024 bit DHE. Cracking all the DHE exchanges is probably more work than these large organizations can do with current technology. However, it is almost certain that these sessions will be readable in the not too distant future.
It is widely believed that most large sites have had their RSA secret keys compromised, which makes all these sessions are trivially readable.
I think that the vast majority of TLS list commenters want to have TLS 1.3 include fixes for the problems that have been identified. However, getting TLS 1.3 approved is at least a year, and getting it through the FIPS process will add at least another year. We already know that these large organizations work to delay better crypto, sometimes using the argument that we should wait for the perfect solution rather than incrementally adopt better solutions in the mean time.
Cheers - Bill
[1] Implementations which will only do 1024 bit DHE are said to include: Apache with OpenSSL, Java, and Windows crypt libraries (used by Internet Explorer). If longer keys are used by the other side, they abort the connection attempt.

@_subject: [Cryptography] Embedded device key generation problems due to bad PRNGs 
describes net scans for bad RSA keys on the web performed by Zakir Durumeric, Eric Wustrow, Alex Halderman, and Nadia Heninger. Among their conclusions:
We manually verified that 59,000 duplicate keys were repeated due to entropy problems, representing 1% of all certificates, or 2.6% of self-signed certificates. We also found that 585,000 certificates, or 4.6% of all devices used the default certificates pre-installed on embedded devices.
More surprisingly, we discovered that entropy problems can allow a remote attacker with no special access to factor a significant fraction of the RSA keys in use on the Internet. We were able to factor 0.4% of the RSA keys in our SSL scan. We did this by computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all pairs of moduli from RSA public keys on the Internet.
However, thereâs no need to panic as this problem mainly affects various kinds of embedded devices such as routers and VPN devices, not full-blown web servers.
The list of vulnerable devices that we have already identified includes more than thirty different manufacturers, including almost all of the biggest names in the computer hardware industry. The kinds of products that we identified include firewalls, routers, VPN devices, remote server administration devices, printers, projectors, and VOIP phones.
This is a problem, but itâs not something that average users need to worry about just yet. However, embedded device manufacturers have a lot of work to do, and some system administrators should be concerned. This is a wake-up call to the security community, and a reminder to all of how security vulnerabilities can sometimes be hiding in plain sight.

In this case there is an active UI with an attached keyboard and mouse. It is probably a really major change to Linux boot, but use any excuse to get user to move the mouse and you have plenty of "randomness" to seed the RNG.

I think about how my car keys work. I have two cars, one with a RF dongle, and one without. The one with the RF dongle is clearly less secure than the one without. The RF dongle + the key are two ways to get into the car. If you find a lost key with the dongle, just walk thru the parking lot and push the buttons -- the car will announce itself.
OTOH, the only way into the one without a dongle is to find the car and open the lock. Either car is at risk from a MIT/Cal Tech student who knows lock picking.
I think this analysis makes a good metaphor for the design of a USB dongle.

OK, I'm not "most people". I pay cash for a lot of things. I shop in farmer's and flea markets where cash is king. What I don't pay cash for is mostly:
   Times when I don't have that much cash.
   Vendor's who will take a personal check (mostly friends).
   Gasoline (credit cards are just too easy).
   Online buys (ditto).
Most everything else is cash. I think I mostly use cash for the faster transactions, but privacy paranoia may also play a role.

I fully agree, which is why I contribute to this list.
But the flaws in our computer systems, protocols, and procedures, coupled with our failure to use what we have makes the assumption of complete openness the only safe assumption.
I personally don't worry about NSA too much. Revealing what they can gather from my electronic world isn't worth the cost revealing the extent of their spying. As a US person, I worry much more about foreign intelligence agencies. They are attempting to undermine US companies which I depend on economically. Helping these companies keep secrets from them is in my best interests.
I think there are examples on record of these signals being intercepted.
I agree, it probably wouldn't be played at all.
Fortunately, information transfer, particularly the results of R&D, is much more complex than just reading correspondence between developers. In real world cases, it frequently takes hours/days/weeks of one-on-one teaching to transfer the ideas.
Trade secrets are in trouble in a completely open world, although there is still some legal protection if a trade secret is stolen. Patents, copyrights, and trademarks can continue unscathed. Those are the four kinds of legal IP I know of.

I assume that all my email is as private as messages to this list.
I assume that the government can listen to my phone calls and IMs.
The one time I actually thought I was having a private conversation was in a cave. We were in a passage that had never been entered before. Hidden recording devices were a possibility, but since we were in on a week-long trip, unlikely without collusion from one of the participants. Too bad we didn't have anything to say that required that level of security.

This is a bit of a misinterpretation the point I was trying to make.
The crypto is, in theory, effective. But in practice, there is a large body of things around it which render its effectiveness irrelevant in important cases:
   The OS it runs on
   The hardware it runs on
   Mistakes by the people using it
   The RNGs it depends on
If you need absolute assurance that your secrets are being kept, don't give them to a computer, because doing so involves some level of risk.
It would be interesting to compare the computer risks with the risks of sending the secret through the US mail. If the threat model is massive, non-targeted snooping, then clearly the mail is safer. If it is targeted snooping, envelopes are easy to steam open.

While the identity of humans and their programs is important for audit trails, what is really needed for security is the authority of humans and programs. If you know who is making a request, you really don't know much. You still must make a decision to grant access or not, and you run a significant risk of confused deputies. On the other hand, if you know the request is authorized, you can just honor it.
Many operating systems, KeyKOS among them, have demonstrated the ability to provide "reference monitor" functionality with out special hardware support. KeyKOS used supervisor/problem modes and standard virtual memory protection. Cheers - Bill

Well, to finish, FOSS isn't a security protocol, its a development method, in particularly good repute with the readers of this list (including me).
Since I hadn't heard of Pond, I think I can clearly argue that it hasn't achieved the necessary market penetration to have "achieved wide adoption."
I agree Ben. PGP is perhaps the best counter example. It was clearly developed for political reasons, and the requirement for payment for commercial uses was really and after thought.
Perhaps restating the claim as, "No security protocol without a revenue model can win in the marketplace against one that has one."
Note that in retrospect, I'm not sure that Diffie Hellman is a security protocol. It can be part of one such as TLS (nee SSL), but by itself is not a protocol.
It is clear to me that the TLS CA model won because people could build a business as a CA. Lynn Wheeler makes this point explicit when he talks of strong arm methods used to suppress alternatives.

In the case of AES, many companies agreed they needed a common, trusted encryption algorithm to replace DES. NIST ran a competition to select one and AES was the result. Many companies have build products that incorporate AES. QED
In the case of OpenPGP, PGP was built by Phil Zimmermann for political reasons to protect activist's data. Commercial use required a fee. I agree that PGP was not primarily motivated by the profit motive. Its success was due to being the only choice available, and the fact that it worked. Note that PGP Corporation was a purely commercial enterprise based on PGP.
SHA3's history is similar to AES. It is also driven by commercial interests which need compatibility and trust.
The Diffie Hellman algorithm was granted U.S. Patent 4,200,770 and was assigned to Stanford University. While Stanford's interest was primarily in encouraging academic research, they did try to make money licensing the patent. ECDHE is an implementation of Diffie Hellman using elliptic curves instead of modular integer multiplication which gives faster implementation with smaller data. Again, the commercial interests drove ECDH's adoption (after negotiating a minefield of patents).
I wouldn't be surprised if the developer of the Bitcoin protocol didn't extract some money as an early adopter. There is, of course, no proof.
I don't recognize Pond or FOSS, and I've done enough free research for tonight.

In explanation, I offer "Frantz's law": No security protocol will achieve wide adoption unless it includes a revenue model which someone can use to build a business.
In explanation for why we have CAs, I offer "Frantz's law": No security protocol will achieve wide adoption unless it includes a revenue model which someone can use to build a business.
We can go back to Machiavelli' observation that to introduce a new way of doing things requires a strong supporter to overcome the inertia and hostility of all the people doing it the old way. The profit motive generates strong supporters.
Some may claim that SSH is a counterexample, but in the beginning, SSH was only available as a software product, and while it is now universal for sysadmins accessing servers, that is really a very narrow market in the scheme of things.

The post I saw on this question in the TLS working group is that TLS should mandate two algorithms for every crypto class (hash, symmetric cypher, etc.) Then if any single algorithm is compromised, a parameter change eliminating it will allow continued secure communication. Since connector proposes and connectee choses, fixing either would work.

It seems to me that using FPGAs offers a good route to secure hardware.
When we worked on KeyKOS, we were concerned about a Ken Thompson like attack on the assembler we were using. We decided that such an attack was a minor concern, since the assembler we were using was written before KeyKOS was designed, and it seemed quite hard to insert a Trojan in a system you had no knowledge of.
One advantage of FPGAs, is the large semantic difference between the programming level of the FPGA and the target architecture of the CPU. I think that large difference makes Trojans harder. As has been suggested by others, randomizing the location of various functions on the FPGA may be worthwhile.
The disadvantage of a FPGA CPU is performance. It almost certainly won't be as fast as Intel etc.'s latest.
In a very real sense, programming your own FPGA is a way to follow much of the production in your own lab, following grarpamp's advice.

The scenario I have in mind is China deciding that all hardware used for sensitive applications -- government, banking, military, etc. -- must be designed and made in China. I consider this scenario at least reasonably likely. A security review ruse probably wouldn't work, and we probably wouldn't trust that hardware for sensitive applications anyway.

While I agree that getting the source code by asking for it, perhaps as part of a security review, is the most likely route, I really think the NSA could reverse engineer hard drive control code. My guess is that reverse engineering is much easier than decrypting Verona. This technique might be useful for a secret foreign piece of hardware.
