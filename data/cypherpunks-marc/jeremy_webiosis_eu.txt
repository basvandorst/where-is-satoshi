@_subject: Re: [tor-talk] IBM says Block Tor 
I may have glossed over much of the report after seeing them say 'Some are
whistleblowers or citizens of
repressive regimes with (allegedly) =B3pure=B2 motives.=B9 - biased from the
IBM MSS data apparently shows an increase in attacks via Tor - ok, so
where is their data? What percentage of the total is it and has the
overall total also increased? Ok they do elude to the fact that SQL
injection attacks and DDoS are common but the report seems very one-sided.
