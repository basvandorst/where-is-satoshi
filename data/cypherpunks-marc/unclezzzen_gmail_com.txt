I don't understand much about CAs, but I know what paypal does: you paste
your public key (while being logged in via ssl, of course) and THEY sign it
for you.
They also show you a "key id" string (don't remember exact name) that you
should include inside the encrypted request (probably against a case where
the key gets compromised, but not the app's config). The user/password auth
pop3 has seems equivalent to that (at least to me).
PR-wise (e.g. if there's a petition), maybe it's easier to explain this to
laypeople (like me) along the lines of:
"we want google to do what paypal does, but google says:
privacy-via-bureaucracy or no privacy at all"
and only in the fine-print dive into the way CAs work.
Just a thought.
