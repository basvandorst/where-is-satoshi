Try this - go into the Webmin Configuration module, click on Authentication
and turn off session authentication mode. Then logout of webmin, quit your
browser and re-run it, then try the file manager again.
I've found that on OSX, browsers do not pass cookies to java applets, and because webmin uses cookies for authentication by default the file manager applet fails.

What operating system and browser are you using? I seem to recall someone else mentioning this problem on OSX.

across the internet for the last couple of days.. Fortunately, I don't
think any of its messages have actually been sent to the Webmin list,
even though they may appear to have been due to fake From: and To:

Hmm .. it looks like he is actually posting to the list address
webmin-l which does relay through my mail server. And using
a fake From: address of one of the list subscribers, which makes it hard
to stop ..

Which browser are you using, and which specific popup button is
causing this?
