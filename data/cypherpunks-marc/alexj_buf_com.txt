If you have cleaned the drive and you still get the same error, that might indeed mean that your drive is broken.  But I recommended that you power-cycle the drive in order to reset it.
Also, please do check the drive using tar and dd, by writing to a scratch tape.  Just tar up a large directory directly to the tape drive, as in
Do you get an error after a few hundreds of MB just like amanda reports?   In that case the error is definitely not with amanda but with your drive somewhere.  From your syslog I gather that you are using ide-tape, which I don't know at all.  You might want to redirect your problems to a more relevant list for that specific drive unless someone else chimes in.

Please check whether your tape drive works with standard utilities (tar, dd, mt).  Something seems to be seriously hosed.  Have you already hard-reset everything, by power-cycling?

Since you told me in private mail that you don't get an error trying to read the files directly off your holding disk, the problem seems to be with the tape drive.  Try cleaning it, then do an amflush.  Did you check the syslog?

This error would normally indicate an out-of-tape condition.  What size are your tapes supposed to be?  (Real tapes or virtual tapes on disk?) If the same error manifests itself with different tapes, try reading the files in your holding disk:
cd /var/amanda/cache
cat */* > /dev/null
It might just be you've got an error on your holding disk.  Checking the syslog is certainly a good idea as well.
