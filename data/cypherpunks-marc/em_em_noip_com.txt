What do you mean with "operator"? AFAIK, the system is fully peer-to-peer
( ).
Regarding the crypto, at  they
 What type of encryption is used?
 Skype uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) - also known as Rijndel
 - which is also used by U.S. Government organizations to protect
 sensitive, information. Skype uses 256-bit encryption, which has a
 total of 1.1 x 1077 possible keys, in order to actively encrypt the
 data in each Skype call or instant message. Skype uses 1536 to 2048
 bit RSA to negotiate symmetric AES keys. User public keys are
 certified by Skype server at login.
OK, so "Rijndael" is misspelled and the RSA-based key exchange does not
provide forward secrecy, but apart from that it doesn't smell like snake
oil. Not too bad, at least.
BUT, unfortunately, the implementation is closed source, so there are no
guarantees that the software is not GAKked. And yes, definitely an
opensource (and multiplatform) alternative would be a cool thing to have.
A message I posted a while ago to the list p2p-hackers was reposted by
Eugene Leitl to cypherpunks

the couple of followups it elicited didn't seem to center the issues I

 RSA (ie persistant keys) may be an option but MUST NOT be
 required, for secrecy reasons as mentioned.  (At worst RSA keys
 can be used once, then discarded.  Lots of primes out there :-)
Well, I don't see why RSA signatures (only for authentication of the key
exchange) could endanger forward secrecy.
 Also, this is *voice*, ie biometric auth,
 so public-key-web-o-trust verislime scam is
 unnecessary at best.
It's not only voice, it's also IM-style text chat. And even with voice,
biometric authentication becomes awkward to use with conference calls.

 We don't give a flying fuck as to which shiny new algorithm you use,
 although were we a graph theory wonk, we might care.
The issue here is that DHT algorithms allow to implement a fully
distributed directory, which means one much more resistant to attacks
(especially from institutional attackers) than implementations based on
centralized servers (see, in a related fild, the different destinies of
Napster and its distributed successors such as Overnet or the less
efficient Gnutella). Still, a full search takes O(log(n)) steps, making
them practical for implementing directory/presence services.

 What the NAT world (yawn) needs is free registry services
 exploitable by any protocol.  Those NAT-users with RSA-clue can
 sign their registry entry.
Not only that: NATted agents cannot be "called" unless they first register
with some reflector on the open Internet. And centralized reflectors are,
again, easy to attack, and also expensive to operate, as the bandwidth
requirements are substantial (all the traffic flows through them): see
e.g. John Walker's analysis of the reasons that led him to abandon
SpeakFreely at  .
Thomas Shaddack suggested to leverage on Jabber, but:
1. Jabber uses TCP as transport, and therefore can't be efficiently used
as transport for telephony, i.e. using encapsulation of the voice packets
in the Jabber protocol in order to traverse NAT devices.
2. Jabber is based on a client-server paradigm similar to e-mail. Running
a Jabber server requires an always-on machine with its own domain name;
and, although dynamic DNS can help, the model again tend to be
hierarchical, easy to attack etc. That pretty much rules it out also for
session initiation, directory/presence etc.
The beauty of Skype, encryption aside, is that it's based on an overlay
network solely based on P2P servents, relies (if their FAQ tells the
truth) upon NO central registry for presence and directory services, and
each client that runs non-NATted can transparently act as reflector
supporting NATted users. Plus, all this (including, besides voice,
text-based instant messaging) works with zero configuration with an
idiotproof UI.

Or, not exploits we're aware of...
Right, that's precisely my point. Skype is showing us the way to go,
although the security of the product may not be good enough (and being
closed source, it's automatically untrusted).
That's understandable considering their business model. But I see Skype as
a proof of feasibility for the "real thing": an opensource application
built on sound bases.
I've read that Skype uses an iLBC codec implemented by Global IP Sound.
There is also an opensource implementation of it (

I believe that we are finally close to the point where all the bits and
pieces for a secure, multiplatform, decentralized, opensource Internet
phone + text IM are available, and it would only take some coding effort
to put them to work together:
- Codec: Speex (
- Portable audio interface layer: Portaudio (
- Bulk encryption and authentication: SRTP, now a standard-track protocol
(RFC3711) and with an opensource reference implementation available at
srtp.sourceforge.net .
- Key exchange: authenticated D-H (how to perform the authentication, as I
said, should be discussed: biometric is not viable if only the text chat
feature is used, and multy-party conferencing calls for suitable
extensions to the basic D-H scheme)
- Directory and presence: any good P2P content-addressable scheme.
Preserving some sort of interoperability with file-sharing applications
would solve the bootstrapping problem (hundreds of thousands of nodes are
already up and running), but the most popular networks (eMule, Overnet and
ReverseConnect) are based on Kademlia, which is a Distributed Hash Table
algorithm and therefore doesn't allow sorted access (useful, e.g., to
locate the reflector with the largest available bandwidth). I recently
discovered a few tree-based distributed algorithms which would allow just

In the world of international trade, where mutual distrust between buyer
and seller is often the rule and there is no central authority to enforce
the law, this is traditionally achieved by interposing not less than three
trusted third parties: the shipping line, the opening bank and the
negotiating bank. First, the buyer asks his bank to open an irrevocable
letter of credit (L/C), which is a letter sent to the seller's bank
instructing it to pay the seller once the latter presents a given set of
documents: these usually include the "bill of lading" (B/L), issued by the
shipping line to declare that the desired cargo was indeed loaded on
board. The seller gets the letter of gredit from his bank and is now sure
that he will be paid by the latter (which he trusts); so he purchases or
manufactures the goods, delivers them to the shipping line getting the
B/L, passes it together with the other documents to his bank, and draws
the payment. The seller's bank sends by mail the documents to the buyer's
bank (which it trusts due to long-standing business relationships),
knowing that it will eventually receive the settlement money. The buyer's
bank receives the documents, debits the buyer's account, remits the monies
to the seller's bank, and delivers the documents to the buyer. When the
ship arrives to the buye's seaport, the buyer goes to the shipping line,
presents to it the B/L and in exchange gets the cargo (in sea shipments,
the B/L represents title to the goods).
That's way trickier because there are no trusted third parties, not even
e-gold Ltd. / G&SR, Inc. The trust chain with the L/C works well because
delegation of trust is unnecessary: every link in the chain bears
responsibility only to its adjacent links.
Interestingly, with L/C's this problem is addressed by involving yet
another third party: an internationally-recognized inspection company
(e.g., the Swiss SGS) that issues a document certifying that the cargo is
indeed what the buyer expects and not, i.e., bricks. Banks and shipping
lines don't want to get involved in these issues; the seller's bank will
only check all the documents requested by the L/C (possibly including the
inspection certificate).
But it's hard to assess the value of partially-released code. If the
gradual transfer bits-against-cents is aborted, what is left to the buyer
is likely to be unusable, whereas the partial payment still represents
good value.
A more general issue is that source code is not a commodity, and
intellectual property is not "real" property: so the traditional "cash on
delivery" paradigm just doesn't work, and looking for protocols
implementing it kind of moot. If the code is treated as trade secret,
rather than licensed, an anonymous buyer may make copies and resell them
on the black market more than recovering his initial cost, at the same
time undercutting your legitimate sales (see e.g. the cases of RC4 and
RC2). This can cause losses order of magnitude larger than refusing to pay
for his copy.

Actually, that doesn't apply to any century. The ancient philosophical
school that inspired Mao Zedong was actually Legalism, which provided the
theoretic foundations to the absolutist rule of Qin Shi Huangdi (to whom
Mao liked to compare himself). Mao, as many other Chinese reformers and
writers of the early XX Century, hated Confucianism as symbol of China's
"ancien regime" and decay. Which is why the campaign against Zhou En-lai
of 1974-75 had an anti-Confucian theme (see e.g. the posters at
 )
Legalists and Qin Shi Huangdi himself were pretty nasty types, and their
domination saw widespread confiscation of books, ridiculously harsh rule
(arriving late to work could bring the death penalty!) and large-scale
assassination or rivals: several Confucian philosophers were buried alive.
The ruthless methods of the Qin dinasty ultimately resulted in its
downfall: it only lasted one and half decade (221 - 206 BC), half of what
Maoism did.
By comparison, Confucianism was remarkably enlightened, which is also why
Voltaire expressed a good opinion of it. Some Confucian philosophers like
Mencius (372-289 AC) were early theorists of people's sovereignty:
"The people are the most important element in a nation; the spirits of the
land and grain are the next; the sovereign is the lightest [...] When a
prince endangers the altars of the spirits of the land and grain, he is
changed, and another appointed in his place."
[Mencius, Book 7:  ]
...and of the right to tyrannicide, justified by the loss of legitimacy
brought by misrule:
"The king said, 'May a minister then put his sovereign to death?' Mencius
said, 'He who outrages the benevolence proper to his nature, is called a
robber; he who outrages righteousness, is called a ruffian. The robber and
ruffian we call a mere fellow."
[Mencius, Book 1:  ]
