I'm sorry for the distraction with the mailing list problems.
Taking an ecosystem view, the miners are important, so are all the other
participants who rely on it and  invest time, effort and energy to make
Bitcoin work and work well.
I am in contact with Primavera and it would appear that the Cyberport is
available for use on October 14 and 15 (Wed/Thursday).
Last November, this was where the Global Bitcoin Summit (Hong Kong)
was hosted with the participation of many of China's leading
Bitcoin-related companies. There is a meeting now in Shanghai.
It would be an honour to host a more technical meeting to discuss BIP100,
101 et al. should be interest to do so.

Thank you very much Peter for pointing this out! That is very kind of you.
It would be great to work with Constance Choi, Primavera De Filippi, your
goodself and others to make this happen.
As you may know, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority considers bitcoin a
virtual 'commodity' and not a currency per se.

Dear Adam, All:
At the community's convenience, it would be an honour to arrange an initial
open summit to meet with representatives of the Chinese miners in Hong Kong
(UTC+8) to facilitate a better understand between the different
stakeholders of the Bitcoin ecosystem on this important issue.   This could
be arranged for this October, or earlier, if deemed necessary.
Remote online participation would be welcome from those who might not be
able to attend in person.
However,  it is hoped that such a meeting would be primarily document
driven to facilitate orderly translation, discussion and decision.
