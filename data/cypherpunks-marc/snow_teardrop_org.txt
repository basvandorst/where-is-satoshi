Yes! Yes! Yes!
I've been making this exact argument for about a year. It even retains
the same "email a link" reset mechanism when someone needs to reset
their key.
A common counter-argument is, "But ordinary Internet users won't
understand SSH keys." They don't need to! The idea is easily explained
via a lock-and-key metaphor that people already understand. The UI for
walking users through key creation is easily imagined.
