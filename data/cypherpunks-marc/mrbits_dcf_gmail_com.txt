We're talking about it the entire morning. Nice news for a halloween.
You got two great points. First of all I think they didn't catch the main point of TOR network. Otherwise, who's certifying SSL key?
About second question, or they made a commercial agreement with people in TOR OR they are able to spoof any .onion address. My
guess is for second one.
Why in hell somebody in TOR network will access facecrap? If TOR intent to give anonymous networking, why to use a service where
you get anything but be anonymous? Do this make sense?
In other hands, this is Chewbacca...
