I would say the key question is 'who cares about your data the most?'.
Do you want someone who's only concern is ticking enough boxes in order to get paid and not sued or someone who passionately cares about the data?
You are the only person who values the security of your data.

It looks to me like they have just taken snippets of info from various other texts (probably legal/law enforcement relates sites) to use to raise their profile on search engines.
They seem to be advertising a service for doing background checks on people so these bits of text may help with matching the search terms used by people who are looking for that kind of service.

Basically, right click in page, choose 'view source' from the menu and then search for Bell within the displayed text.
There's your hidden text :)
There's a bunch of 'metadata' in any web page used for controlling shit like this that is never visible on the actual web page.
View source will show this.

Yeh, it's a big problem, those three objects link your use of the onion
with your use of freedom.press and any other website you might use that
is hosted via CF.
At the very least, for any organisation who wants to be associated with
privacy or freedom movements then this is negligence.
If they maintain their aloofness and satisfaction with not giving a fuck
about their end users then I don't expect them to change them - worst
case scenario they are supposed to be there, hopefully not.

@_subject: Re: Snowden on the Twitters 
Not sure if I'm missing something here but CF's CEO confirmed what I had
tested on Twitter.
The Web Service owners have to give CF their private keys.
So they are complicit in giving away your "secure" communications to CF
(and whoever they are buddies with, whether it be Advertisers or NSA et al).
But they do not tell the end users that they are using a service such as
CF which if they did would at least give the end users a chance to make
their own mind up.
This is an issue that needs to be looked at but using WAF's is not a
solution to DDoS, it's a malware solution so in fact they only need to
ensure your traffic passes through CF without decrypting it to gain DDoS
protection - that is a routing issue.
There is a big problem with the centralisation with the internet in this
way but it is also very difficult and costly to for a website to handle
large volumes of traffic in an independent DC.
But responding to DDoS by using services such as CF is playing into the
hands of the likes of the NSA who may well be behind a number of the
attacks in order to promote the CF "solution".
Snowden is a moderate extremist, he doesn't want transparent government
and private individuals, he just wants a discussion on where to draw the
line with surveillance, his leaks are purely to further this aim.
Assange and the people who have worked with him on leaks are more the
kind of people we need.

Sorry, didn't sign :P
I contacted one of the guys from freedom.press about this and his response was that it was an acceptable risk because they were being DDoS'd.
One of the guys on here, razer ray?, linked to a Yasha Levine article linking CF CEO to Project Honeypot and reckoned he was encouraged to start CF by DoD or some other Gov agency.
I'm not a big fan of Yasha and don't entirely trust what he writes (just an opinion, don't sue :D ) but there were news articles in other websites about some of this stuff.
So, you have to make up your own mind but  i block CF IP addresses and have decided that freedom.press is an evil entity.

Yeh, that opinion came after an exchange with Greenwald on Twitter about
releasing the entire cache but unfortunately that Twitter account is
gone now due to Twitter's hatred of Tor so I can't fish it out.
But if you read through quotes from Snowden himself you see that he
leaked the information to cause a debate about how we should be
governed, not because he thinks the Government should be transparent.
A quote from his Wikipedia page (yeh I know no-one trusts Wikipedia but
sometimes it's handy):-
"For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already
accomplished. I already won. As soon as the journalists were able to
work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated. Because,
remember, I didn't want to change society. I wanted to give society a
chance to determine if it should change itself. All I wanted was for the
public to be able to have a say in how they are governed."

Its always good to have choice :)
It looked tome lime SiFive actually have some early boards ready to ship.
The only issue with both of these is the potential for backdoors in the hardware when they're shipped compared to the sources.
Without Openfabs with ability for interested ppl to go in unannounced to check/audit then we can't escape this risk.

obviously elle-twat wants to derail your sensible questions.
If your encryption is sufficiently strong (ppl seem happy with AES256, any better suggestions) and your random number generator wasn't designed or influenced by the NSA then you're likely to keep your information private.
Note that you will then become the weak link and if the information is sufficiently important then it will get painful :)
In terms of a Windows (you said Outlook) based remailer then I'd see Windows as the weak link, especially if its v7/8 or 10.

Wrong thought experiment, a chat is realtime - conversation becomes lost when trolls attack but a mail list allows for emails to hang around long enough to be read and replied to despite any spam that might appear in thw thread.
