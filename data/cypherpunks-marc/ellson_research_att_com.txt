Yes, the user probably meant "height", but no, dot shouldn't complain.
Its perfectly legal for you to use any attribute name you like in the .dot language.  Its
not a closed namespace.    Only certain attributes are understood by the layout engines,
and if you misspell them, then they won't be understood.    My suggestion is to use "vim"
for creating .dot files as it will highlight attribute names that it Also, I think you probably need quotes around strings with periods in them
Well, style is probably the worst example as it is a PostScript'ism from the very
first renderer.   Again, it is arbitrarily extensible, although that isn't particularly useful.
The usual suggestion for examples is to grep though the example graphs that are shipped with graphviz.
In graphs/[directed|undirected]/  in the source tree, and typically installed into:
    /usr/share/graphviz/graphs/[directed|undirected]/
