The text currently reads like:
- - you need to generate the params files once
- - for greater security, re-generate every now and then
The improved security that is gained in the first step is not obvious,
which is why I went looking for the details on the params that Postfix
uses when the settings are left untouched.
You might want to make it clearer that providing customized params is
more secure than using the builtins. After that, running a cronjob to
refresh them is another improvement.

As stated, I assumed that the default primes came from openssl, based
on the smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file description in postconf(5). While
reading 'using the exact same parameter sets as distributed with other
TLS packages', I was assuming 'other TLS packages' to be other
(non-postfix, non-SMTP) software packages also using openssl.
After another re-read of the forward secrecy document (and from your
reply), I now found the part that states that the default primes are
postfix builtins. I missed this link.
So it doesn't have to be more technical or advanced. There were some
connections between dots missing in the higher level picture.

After reading, I'm having some questions.
The document states that forward secrecy is supported by default on
recent postfix installs. However, the quick-start still has some
settings that apparently need tweaking.
Setting 'smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade = strong' is already available as
default (tested with postfix 2.10), so no actual work here.
Setting the files (and refreshing them using a cronjob) specified by
'smtpd_tls_mumble_param_file' is a bit unclear though. The default for
these params is empty, and setting them does not really show a
different behavior in postfix (i.e. using different ciphers and keys)
as far as visible from the logged information.
But since forward secrecy is supported by default, what does it help
to specify these params, and re-generate them once in a while? I've no
deep ssl knowledge, but the smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file postconf
documentation seems to indicate that openssl distributes some kind of
defaults for these contents? Maybe it's a nice idea to make the
forward secrecy and/or postconf documentation a bit verbose on how
this works, and what benefits manual generation of these params has?
