More routing news : Wikileaks has been booted off Amazon EC2
"Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT), chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, was among the congressmen who pressured Amazon to stop hosting Wikileaks...
The site was down briefly after being ejected from Amazon, but is back up and once again running on the servers of Bahnhof, its previous Swedish hosting provider."

Yes, that is what both spokesmen literally did
"I am not aware of any conversations by the United States government" - said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley.
"I am not aware that the Department of Defense is behind any of the problems that WikiLeaks is experiencing," Col. Dave Lapan, Pentagon spokesman.
Not the Department, not the Secretary, not the Joint Chiefs, just the lowly old spokesman, all by himself, who is "not aware."  A weaker and less convincing denial can scarcely be imagined this side of the divorce court. And the CNN headline, while technical true :
U.S. officials deny they are urging technical takedown of WikiLeaks
would be more accurate as
Minor U.S. officials deny they are personally urging technical takedown of WikiLeaks
which would have not nearly had the same punch.

Here is a dumb idea that I have actually seen cause problems :
Is it possible that the declination of the satellite from your location is the same as the Sun right now ? That will cause up to several hours of interruption every mid-day. The clue is that the shadow of the receiver box is in the center of the dish (for prime focus mounts). You might be surprised how many times this has caught people, so I thought I would mention it.
